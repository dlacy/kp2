<p><span class="font0">times obtained for a certain annual sum, called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">obroh,</span><span class="font0"> in lieu of service. As a general rule, he has a house and a portion&nbsp;of land, for which he pays rent in labour instead of money.&nbsp;He works three days in the week for his master, and has&nbsp;the remainder of his time at his own disposal. A day’s labour of a man includes that of his wife and his horse when&nbsp;requisite. These peasants, who are for the most part in a&nbsp;state of the grossest ignorance, are perfect predestinarians,&nbsp;or fatalists ; and this doctrine serves as an excuse on all occasions for their habitual improvidence and want of forethought. Yet, though ignorant, superstitious, and a slave,&nbsp;the serf seems in general happy and contented, and bears&nbsp;about him no signs of oppression ; his desires are few and&nbsp;easily satisfied ; though his fare is coarse and poor, he seldom suffers from cold or hunger, and he is naturally gay,&nbsp;good-humoured, and light-hearted.” The situation of domestic servants is much worse than that of the peasant,&nbsp;whose great dread is the conscription, and a serious evil it&nbsp;is when it visits him. The peasant cannot legally be sold&nbsp;or transferred from one master to another, excepting with&nbsp;the whole of his family ; but this law is often broken or&nbsp;evaded. “ There are few landed proprietors who do not&nbsp;carry on a manufactory of some kind or other. The riches&nbsp;of the Russian gentleman lie in the labour of his serfs,&nbsp;which it is his study to turn to good account ; and he is&nbsp;the more urged to this, since the law which compels the&nbsp;peasant to work for him, requires him to maintain the peasant ; if the latter is found begging, the former is liable to&nbsp;a fine. He is therefore a master who must always keep a&nbsp;certain number of workmen, whether they are useful to&nbsp;him or not ; and as every kind of agricultural and out-doors&nbsp;employment is at a stand during the winter, he naturally&nbsp;turns to the establishment of a manufactory as a means of&nbsp;employing his peasants, and as a source of profit to himself.&nbsp;In some cases the manufactory is at work only during the&nbsp;winter, and the people are employed in the summer in agriculture. The alternate employment of the same man in&nbsp;the field and in the factory, which would be attempted in&nbsp;most countries with little success, is here rendered practicable and easy by the versatile genius of the Russian peasant, one of whose leading national characteristics is a general capability of turning his hand to any kind of work&nbsp;which he may be required to undertake.” Not only are the&nbsp;Russian nobles manufacturers, but they carry on the business in every branch ; and from the privileges which they&nbsp;enjoy, they have great advantages over the other classes&nbsp;who are not allowed to possess serfs. In almost every house&nbsp;some art is carried on, useful or ornamental ; and women&nbsp;are employed in spinning, weaving, knitting, carpet-making,&nbsp;and the like. Mr Bremner informs us that seven shillings&nbsp;and sixpence a week is the general pay of a labourer in the&nbsp;field, and that the best hands in the manufactories can only&nbsp;earn nine shillings and sixpence a week. Hence no people&nbsp;in Europe are so plainly or coarsely fed as the Russians.&nbsp;Their daily fare consists of pickled cucumbers, cabbages,&nbsp;and mushrooms, with a piece of black bread. Fish and&nbsp;butcher-meat are great rarities amongst the poor ; they live&nbsp;upon the wretched articles which we have specified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The established religion of Russia is that of the Greek Church, to which the great bulk of the population belongs,&nbsp;although all others are tolerated, no civil or political disabilities attaching to those who profess other creeds. In regard to the doctrines of this church, it may be briefly stated,&nbsp;that they differ in several essential particulars from those&nbsp;of the Roman Catholics, although there is a general accordance. The first of these particulars is, that it holds the&nbsp;necessity of complete submersion of the whole body at baptism ; the second, that whilst it admits the doctrine of tran-substantiation in regard to the eucharist, it affirms that the&nbsp;bread must be leavened and the wine mixed with water,&nbsp;and they allow both elements to be distributed to every&nbsp;communicant, even to children before they have any correct idea of sin ; and a third important distinction relates&nbsp;to the marriage of the clergy, all secular or parish priests&nbsp;being bound to marry. The Greek Church further differs&nbsp;from the Roman Catholic by rejecting purgatory, predestination, works of supererogation, indulgences, and dispensations. Catechising and preaching are scarcely practised ;&nbsp;and mass forms the chief part of the public worship. No instrumental music is allowed, but vocal music is much cultivated. Fast days are numerous, and they are kept with&nbsp;great strictness. In addition to the Wednesday and Friday of every week, there are four principal fasts in the&nbsp;year, and several festivals which are celebrated with eastern pomp and splendour. This church rejects all round or&nbsp;solid images of the Saviour, or of saints, as idolatrous ; but&nbsp;pictures, mosaics, bas-reliefs, in short, whatever is represented on a flat surface, they do not consider as violations of&nbsp;the law which says, “ Thou shalt not make unto thee any&nbsp;graven image.” The state of religion amongst the lower&nbsp;orders is in general deplorable. The most important parts&nbsp;of public worship are, first, to pronounce distinctly and fluently the two words </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gospodi pomilui,</span><span class="font0"> which mean, “ God&nbsp;be merciful ;” secondly, to make the sign of the cross on&nbsp;the breast a countless number of times ; and, thirdly, to bow&nbsp;the head to the ground repeatedly. The common people&nbsp;have a firm belief in good and bad angels. Evil spirits are&nbsp;the tempters and betrayers of men, and they believe that&nbsp;the sign of the cross, which they are very fond of making,&nbsp;will not only drive them away, but avert every kind of misfortune. There are comparatively few sectarians in Russia.&nbsp;The following is as near an approximation as can be arrived at, of the religious diversities of the Russian empire.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The whole spirituality of the Greek Church is divided into priests belonging to some religious order, and secular&nbsp;priests. For the management of church affairs there are&nbsp;at present thirty-six eparchies of three different classes,&nbsp;only four being of the highest class, those of St Petersburg,&nbsp;Moscow, Novgorod, and Kief. There are nine metropolitans, thirteen archbishops, and twenty-nine bishops. All&nbsp;aspiring to these dignities must be members of some monastery, and unmarried. By a statement published a short&nbsp;time since, the number of monasteries throughout the empire would appear to be 350, with 5330 monks. There&nbsp;are ninety-eight nunneries, containing 4162 nuns ; all of&nbsp;them belong to the strict order of St Basil. There are&nbsp;483 cathedrals, and 28,200 parish churches (of which 853&nbsp;are situated in Bessarabia), with 218,418 ecclesiastics of the&nbsp;orthodox Greek ritual, and 7311 ecclesiastics of the united&nbsp;Greek ritual. The Russian clergy may be divided into&nbsp;three classes ; those who are in full orders, including “ pro-topapi,” or inferior priests, and “ papi,” or common priests ;&nbsp;those who are only in what may be called half orders, such&nbsp;as deacons and readers, who are not allowed to administer&nbsp;the sacrament ; and those who have received no ordination</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
