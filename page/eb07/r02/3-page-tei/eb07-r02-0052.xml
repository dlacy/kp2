Of his various performances, this is not that of which the design is the most extensive, or the execution the most elaborate ; but in his historical disquisition we perceive the same patient assiduity in collecting his materials, the same discernment in arranging them, the same perspicuity of narrative, and the same power of illustration, which so eminently distinguish his other writings, and which have long rendered them the delight of the British reader at home, and an honour to British literature abroad.</p><p>His truly useful life was closed on the 11th of June 1793, at Grange-House near Edinburgh, after a lingering illness, which be endured with exemplary fortitude and resignation. He had attained the age of seventy-two. It may be justly observed of him, that no man lived more respected, or died more sincerely lamented. Indefatigable in his literary researches, and possessing from nature a sound and vigorous understanding, he acquired a store of useful knowdedge, which afforded ample scope for the exertion of his extraordinary abilities, and raised him to the most distinguished eminence in the republic of letters. As a minister of the gospel, he was a faithful pastor, and justly merited the esteem and veneration of his flock. In a word, he may be pronounced to be one of the most perfect characters of the age ; and his name will be a lasting honour to the island that gave him birth. His conversation was cheerful, entertaining, and instructive ; his manners affable, pleasing, and endearing.</p><p>The account of his Life and Writings, published by Mr Dugald Stewart, is one of the noblest pieces of biography that any language can boast of. It was published in a separate form, and likewise accompanies the later editions of his works.</p><p>Dr Robertson left a widow and a numerous family in prosperous circumstances. In 1751 he had married Mary the daughter of Mr Nisbet, one of the ministers of Edinburgh, and this domestic union had been productive of much happiness. His eldest son, the late Lord Robertson, was for many years a judge of the Court of Session. Two of his sons belonged to the military profession. His eldest daughter was the wife of Mr Brydone the celebrated traveller, and the mother of the present Countess of Minto. Another daughter married John Russell, Esq. writer to the signet. Lord Brougham is the grandson of Dr Robertson’s sister.</p><p>ROBERV ALLIAN LlNEs, a name given to certain lines used for the transformation of figures, so called from Ro-</p><lb/><p>berval, the inventor of them.' These lines are the boundaries of lines infinitely extended in length, yet equal to other spaces which are terminated on all sides. It is observed by the Abbé Gallois, that the method of transforming figures which is explained at the end of RobervaΓs treatise of Indivisibles, was the same with that afterwards published by James Gregory in his <hi rend="italic">Geometria Universalis,</hi>  and also by Dr Barrow in his <hi rend="italic">Lectiones Geornetricœ ;</hi>  and that it appears from Torricelli’s letter, that Roberval was the inventor of this method of transforming figures, by means of certain lines called by Torricelli, for that reason, <hi rend="italic">Rοbervallian lines. </hi>The same author adds, that J. Gregory probably first learned this method at Padua in the year 1668 ; for the method was known in Italy in 1646, although the book was not published till 1692. David Gregory endeavoured to refute this account, in vindication of bis uncle James. His answer appeared in the Philosophical Transactions for 1694, and Gallois rejoined in the Memoirs of the French Academy for 1703 ; so that it remains in a state of uncertainty to which of the two we are to ascribe the invention.</p><p>ROBIGUS and ROBIGO, a Roman god and goddess, who joined in the preservation of corn from <hi rend="italic">blight.</hi>  Their festival was kept on the 25th of April.</p><p>ROBINS, Benjamin, an ingenious mathematician, was born at Bath in 1707. His parents were Quakers of low condition, and consequently were unable to have him much instructed in human learning ; but his own propensity to science having procured him a recommendation to Dr Pemberton at London, by his assistance, while he attained the sublimer parts of mathematical knowledge, he commenced teacher of the mathematics. But the business of teaching, which required confinement, not suiting his active disposition, he gradually declined it, and engaged in business that required more exercise. Hence he tried many laborious experiments in gunnery, from the persuasion that the resistance of the air has a much greater influence on swift projectiles than is generally imagined. Hence also he was led to consider the mechanic arts that depend on mathematical principles ; as the construction of mills, the building of bridges, the draining of fens, the rendering of rivers navigable, and the making of harbours. Among other arts, fortification much engaged his attention ; and lie met with opportunities of perfecting himself by viewing the principal strong places of Flanders, in some tours which he made with persons of distinction.</p><p>Upon his return from one of these excursions, he found the learned amused with Dr Berkeley’s work entitled “ The Analyst,” in which an attempt was made to explode the method of fluxions. Mr Robins was therefore advised to clear up this subject by giving a distinct account of Sir Isaac Newton’s doctrines, in such a manner as to obviate all the objections that had been made, w ithout naming them. Accordingly he published, in 1735, “A Discourse concerning the Nature and Certainty of Sir Isaac Newton’s Method of Fluxions ;” and, some exceptions being made to his manner of defending Newton, he afterwards wrote two or three additional discourses. In 1738, he defended the same great philosopher against an objection contained in a note at the end of Baxter’s <hi rend="italic">Matho, sive Cοsmotheoria puerilis ;</hi>  and the following year printed Remarks on Euler’s Treatise of Motion, on Dr Smith’s System of Optics, and on Dr Jurin’s Discourse of distinctand indistinct Vision, annexed to Smith’s work. In the mean while, Mr Robins did not solely confine himself to mathematical subjects; for in 1739 he published, without his name, three pamphlets on political affairs. Two of them, relating to the convention and négociation with Spain, were so highly esteemed as to occasion his being employed in a very honourable post : on a committee being appointed to examine into the past conduct of Sir Robert Walpole, he was chosen their secretary.</p><p>In 1742, Mr Robins published a small treatise entitled</p></body></text></TEI>
