                <p><label>ROCKET</label>. (1) The name (Fr. <hi rend="italic">roquette,</hi> Lat.
                        <hi rend="italic">eruca,</hi> a kind of cabbage) of two species of plants.
                    The one, <hi rend="italic">Eruca saliva,</hi> is a cruciferous annual with white
                    flowers veined with purple; the leaves have a sharp flavour and are used in
                    southern Europe for salads. The other is a hardy perennial herbaceous plant, of
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Hesperis <hi rend="sub">1</hi></hi> of which <hi rend="italic">Hesperis matronalis</hi> is the most familiar
                    species (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Horticulture).</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2) A cylinder of paper, pasteboard or metal, filled with an explosive mixture.

               <p>is due to a resemblance in shape. Rockets are used in pyrotechny for purpose of
                    display, scattering showers of stars, coloured balls, &amp;c., on bursting
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Fireworks).</hi> They are also used in signalling, and
                    especially as a part of lifesaving apparatus for wrecks (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Lifeboat</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Life-Saving
                        Service).</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Large and heavy rockets, of which the head formed a projectile, had too a
                    considerable vogue in the early part of the 19th century for war purposes. They
                    were invented by Sir William Congreve <hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> and employed
                    by him both afloat in coast operations and in field operations. Brought to the
                    notice of all armies by the fact that a rocket battery of the Royal Artillery
                    served in the allied army in the Leipzig campaign, war rockets were introduced
                    in many armies, being sometimes issued as an additional portion of the equipment
                    of ordinary field batteries, sometimes reserved for special rocket batteries.
                    The Congreve rocket was in use in the British army as late as i860. There were
                    four natures— 3-pounder, 6-pounder, 12-pounder and 24-pounder. The case was of
                    sheet-iron, on to which was screwed a cylindro-conoidal head forming the
                    projectile. The head was made hollow and could be filled with a bursting charge
                    if a shell effect was desired, a base fuze being provided. The iron case
                    contained the rocket composition, and was closed at the
                    rear end by a metal plate with five holes or vents, and on the centre a bush
                    into which the stick was screwed. These rockets were fired from rocket tubes on
                    tripods, the tubes being provided with a tangent sight. Against masses of troops
                    within easy range, the war rocket was considered an efficient engine; it was
                    used also to set fire to buildings, but was always deficient in accuracy.
                    Eventually the Congreve rocket was superseded by the Hale, of which two patterns
                    were in use, the 9-pounder and the 24-pounder, for field and fortress warfare
                    respectively. These had no sticks, and were centred by the arrangement of the
                    vent, the gases, as they emerged from the vent, impinging upon a screw-formed
                    tail, to which they imparted the necessary rotation. These rockets were fired
                    from a trough. The maximum effective range of the 9-pounder Hale rocket was
                    about 1200 yards. The use of these engines was discontinued in the British
                    service about 1885. On the continent of Europe they had disappeared more than
                    twenty years before. Austria, the last power to use them, broke up her rocket
                    batteries in 1867.</p>
