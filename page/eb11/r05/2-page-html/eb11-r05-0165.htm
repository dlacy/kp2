<p><span class="font0">VI. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Russian has kept </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font0"> where Little Russian (Lit. R.)&nbsp;and Wh. R., like Cech and High Sorb, now have </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">VII. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A specially Russian point is that Proto-Sl. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">je</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ju&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">beginning a word, appear in R. as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">o</span><span class="font0"> and w; O.S. /ed/«#, “ one,”&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jutro, <sup>a</sup></span><span class="font0"> morning,” R. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">odinü, utro.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">VIII. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russian has lost the distinctions of quantity which&nbsp;survive in Cech and S. Slav., but its accent is free as in S. Slav.&nbsp;The accent is extremely capricious, often falling differently in&nbsp;different cases of the same noun, or persons of the same tense,&nbsp;also it is an expiratory accent, so strong that the unaccented&nbsp;syllables are much slurred over and their vowels dulled. In&nbsp;learning Russian it is therefore most important to pay great&nbsp;attention to the accent, and at first to read accented texts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The above phonetic peculiarities have marked Russian as far back as we can trace it. In the earliest documents it appears&nbsp;with an apparatus of grammatical forms practically identical&nbsp;with that ascribed to primitive Slavonic. The history of the&nbsp;language is not so much that of its phonetic decay as that of its&nbsp;morphological simplification and syntactic development. The&nbsp;tracing of this process is rendered difficult by the fact that</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">O.S. was the ecclesiastical and literary language until the 17th century, and though in the end the O.S. texts suffer modifications, producing the Russian form of Church Slavonic, it is&nbsp;only by accident that the Russian forms appear in them.&nbsp;Russian is better represented in additions made by the scribe,&nbsp;as in the colophon of the Ostromir gospel (a.d. 1056/57), the&nbsp;oldest dated O.S. MS. In a certain number of legal documents&nbsp;dating from the 12th century onwards Russian forms definitely&nbsp;predominate, but the subject-matter is too limited to offer much&nbsp;material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Borrowings.</span><span class="font0">—The effect of the Church language upon Russian has been very strong, comparable to that of Latin upon French&nbsp;or English: O.S. forms of words and suffixes, betrayed by&nbsp;their phonetic peculiarities though pronounced more or less&nbsp;d </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">la russe,</span><span class="font0"> have in some cases ousted the native forms, in other&nbsp;cases the two exist side by side; the Slav, form generally has&nbsp;the more dignified or metaphorical, the Russian the simpler&nbsp;and more direct sense: even some of the grammatical terminations </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font0"> pres. part, act.; certain forms of the adj., &amp;c.) are&nbsp;Slavonic; but speakers are quite unconscious of using anything that is not Russian (see S. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Búlié, Church Slavonic Elements&nbsp;in Modern Russian,</span><span class="font0"> St P., 1893), and not till the 18th century&nbsp;did even grammarians understand the difference. Less&nbsp;important elements have been the Tatar which gave names for&nbsp;many Oriental things such as weapons, jewels, stuffs, garments&nbsp;and some terms concerned with government, and the Polish,&nbsp;which during the 17th century supplied many terms needed&nbsp;to express European things and ideas. In the 18th century&nbsp;such importations were made from Latin and all the Western&nbsp;European languages, in Peter’s time mostly from German and&nbsp;Dutch (for nautical terms, English supplied some), in Catherine’s&nbsp;rather from French, which had become the language of the&nbsp;aristocracy. During the first quarter of the 19th century&nbsp;modem Russian found itself and discarded superfluous Slavonic&nbsp;and European borrowings alike. Since then fresh loan-words&nbsp;have mostly belonged to the international quasi-Greek terminology, though like German R. sometimes prefers analogous&nbsp;compounds made from its own roots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Literary Russian as spoken by educated people throughout the empire is the Moscow dialect (see below) modified by these&nbsp;influences. It is still a highly inflected language, comparable&nbsp;in that respect rather to Latin and Greek than to the languages&nbsp;of western Europe, though during historic time it has lost&nbsp;many of the grammatical forms whose full development we&nbsp;can study in O.S., and whose presence we can assert in the scanty&nbsp;remains of Old R. This process has relieved it of the dual&nbsp;number, save for certain survivals; in the nouns, of the&nbsp;vocative case (save for certain ecclesiastical forms), and many&nbsp;of the distinctions between the declensions, especially in the&nbsp;plural, the oblique cases of the simple, and the more cumbrous&nbsp;forms of the compound, adjective; in the verbs, of the supine,&nbsp;the imperfect, the aorist and the conditional (now reduced&nbsp;to a particle); but this simplification leaves it with six cases,&nbsp;Nom., Acc., Gen., Dat., Instrumental and Locative, three&nbsp;genders, three substantival declensions, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">-a, -0,</span><span class="font0"> -t, and traces&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">-u</span><span class="font0"> and consonantal stems, a special pronominal declension&nbsp;with many tricky forms, an adjective which takes its place&nbsp;between them, and a system of numerals in which a compromise between grammar and logic has produced a kind of&nbsp;maze. The forms of the verb arc easier, as only the present&nbsp;indie, has three persons, the imperat. has but the 2nd, and the&nbsp;past is a participle, which, having discarded the copula, distinguishes only gender and number. The infinitive and four&nbsp;participles offer no special difficulty, but the gerundives&nbsp;or verbal adverbs, from the old masc. nom. sing., are&nbsp;troublesome. The curious mechanism by which these few&nbsp;verbal forms are by means of the aspects made to express&nbsp;most of our tenses and other shades of meaning of which even&nbsp;English is incapable, is briefly explained under Slavs. On the&nbsp;whole the syntax is simple, the periods which imitation of&nbsp;Latin and German once brought into fashion having given place&nbsp;to the shorter sentences of French and English models.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such a language, though less difficult than it is generally supposed, is learned much better if some preliminary study is&nbsp;devoted to the accidence, before the student launches out into&nbsp;conversation, as otherwise the habit may be acquired of disregarding the terminations and speaking very incorrectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dialects.—</span><span class="font0">Russian dialects fall into two main divisions— Great (Velikorusskij), including White (BSlorusskij) Russian,&nbsp;and Little Russian (Malorusskij). The latter is spoken in a&nbsp;belt reaching from Galicia and the Northern Carpathians (see&nbsp;Ruthenians) through Podolia and Volhynia and the governments of Kiev, Chernigov, Poltiva, Kharkov and the southern&nbsp;part of Vordnezh to the Don and the Kubin upon which the&nbsp;Dn£pr Cossacks were settled. To the south of this belt in “ New&nbsp;Russia ” the population is much mixed, but Little Russians on&nbsp;the whole predominate. In all there must be about 30,000,000&nbsp;Little Russians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Great Russian division includes all other Russian speakers—the main body to the N. and E. of the Little&nbsp;Russians, the settlers in Siberia, the Caucasus and along the&nbsp;southern coast, the educated classes, officials and many townsmen throughout the empire, probably not less than 70,000,000&nbsp;speakers exclusive of White Russians. On the whole it is very&nbsp;conservative, and therefore, in spite of its vast extent, is wonderfully uniform. It falls into two main dialect groups—the&nbsp;northern or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">0</span><span class="font0"> group and the southern or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> group. The line&nbsp;between them runs roughly E.S.E. from Pskov to the Oka and&nbsp;then eastwards to the Urals. The northern group is the more&nbsp;conservative and pronounces very nearly according to the&nbsp;spelling, unaccented </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">0</span><span class="font0"> remaining </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">0,</span><span class="font0"> but </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">0</span><span class="font0"> is in general rather&nbsp;like w, while </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font0"> before hard consonants is apt to be </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jo</span><span class="font0"> and before&nbsp;soft consonants </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.</span><span class="font0"> The southern part of this group, comprising most of the governments of Vladimir and Yaroslavl with&nbsp;adjoining parts of Tver and Kostroml, are alone free from a&nbsp;further peculiarity, a tendency to mix up </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font0"> and c which can be&nbsp;traced in the ancient documents of Ndvgorod and has spread&nbsp;with the Ndvgorod colonists across the whole of N. Russia to the&nbsp;Urals and Siberia. These distant dialects have adopted many&nbsp;words from theUgro-Finnish natives. The southern or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> group&nbsp;of dialects pronounces unaccented </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">0, e</span><span class="font0"> and even </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font0"> as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ja\&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">with this goes a tendency to pronounce g as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h,</span><span class="font0"> and to mix up </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">u&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and v. The Moscow dialect, which is the foundation of the&nbsp;literary language, and White Russian, are both best classed with&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> dialect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Moscow dialect really covers a very small area, not even the whole of the government of Moscow, but political causes&nbsp;have made it the language of the governing classes and hence&nbsp;of literature. It is a border dialect, having the southern pronunciation of unaccented </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">0</span><span class="font0"> as a, but in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jo</span><span class="font0"> for accented c</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
