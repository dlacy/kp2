<p><label>RONDA</label>
a town of southern Spain, in the province of Malaga; on the river Guadiaro and on the Algedras-Bobadilla railway. Pop. (1900) 20,995. Ronda is built on a high rock nearly surrounded by the Guadiaro, which flows through an abrupt chasm 530 ft. deep and 300 ft. wide, by which the old town is separated from the new. Of the three bridges, one is said to have been built by the Romans, another by the Moors; the most modern (1761) spans the stream in a single arch at a height of about 255 ft. On the edge of the chasm is the-alameda or pubhâ€™c promenade, commanding a wide and beautiful prospect of the fertile valley or vega and the sierras beyond. The old</p>

The Ronda bull-ring is one of the finest in Spain, and can accommodate 10,000 spectators. Ronda has a considerable trade in leather, saddlery, horses, soap, flour, chocolate, wine and hats.</p><p>Some remains of an aqueduct and theatre, about 7 m.

It gives its name to the Sierra or Serrania de Ronda, one of the main sections of the coast mountains which rise between the great plain of Andalusia and the Mediterranean.</p>
