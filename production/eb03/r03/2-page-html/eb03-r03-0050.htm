<p><span class="font0">volve while proceeding forward, and that theſe are at right angles to each other ; and they have given the&nbsp;conditions which muſt be implemented in the determination of theſe axes. But they ſtill leave us exceedingly at a loſs ſor means to diſcover the poſitions of the&nbsp;axes of a given body which have theſe conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To ſolve this problem therefore in general terms, would lead to a diſquiſition altogether diſproportioned&nbsp;to our work. We muſt reſtrict ourſelves to thoſe forms&nbsp;of body and ſituations of the point of impulſion which&nbsp;admit of the coincidence of the centres of ofcillation&nbsp;and percuſſion ; and we muſt leave out the caſes where&nbsp;the axis has 'a motion in the direction of its length ;&nbsp;that is, we ſhall always ſuppoſe the ſpontaneous axis&nbsp;of converſion to have no motion. Thus we ſhall comprehend the phenomena of the planetary motions, ſimilar to the preceſſion of our equinoctial point?, and all the&nbsp;intereſting caſes oſ practical mechanics. The ſpeculative mathematical reader will fill up the blanks of this&nbsp;inveſtigation by conſuking the writings of Euler and&nbsp;D’Alembert in the Berlin Memoirs, Friſi’s Coſmo-graphia, and the papers of Mr Landen, Mr Milner, and&nbsp;Mr Vince, in the Philoſophical Tranſactions. But we&nbsp;hope, by means of a beautiful propoſition on the com-poſition of rotatory motions, to enable every reader to&nbsp;diſcover the poſition oſ the axis oſ progreſſive rotation&nbsp;in every caſe which may intereſt him, without the&nbsp;previous ſolution of the intricate problem mentioned</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let ABPC∕&gt;i A (fig. 13.) be a ſection of a body through its centre of gravity G, ſo formed, that the&nbsp;part ABPC is ſimilar, and ſimilarly placed with the&nbsp;part </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">AbpC,</span><span class="font0"> ſo that the plane AC would divide it&nbsp;equally. Let thia body bc impelled at P in the direction HP, perpendicular to the plane AC. The axis&nbsp;round which it will turn will be perpendicular to G ‰&nbsp;Suppoſe it at A. Then drawing AB and A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0"> to ſimilar points, it is plairr that B </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">r, b ß</span><span class="font0"> are equal and oppoſite ; theſe repreſent the forces which would raiſe or&nbsp;lower one end of the axis, as has been already obſerved. The axis therefore will remain perpendicular&nbsp;to G ‰</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let the body be ſo ſhaped, that if the parts to the right and left of the point of impulſe jγ (the impulſe is&nbsp;here ſuppoſed not </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">perpendicular</span><span class="font0"> to the plane AC, but&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font0"> this plane) are equal and ſimilarly placed ; then the&nbsp;momenta round AC muſt balance each other, and the&nbsp;axis EF will have no tendency to go out of the plane&nbsp;ABCZ∣ A perpendicular to the impulſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Any body whoſe ſhape has theſe two properties will turn round an axis perpendicular to the plane which&nbsp;paſſes through the centre of gravity in the direction of&nbsp;the impelling force. This condition is always found in&nbsp;the planets when dſtlurbed by the gravitation to a diſtant planet: for they are all figures of revolution.&nbsp;The direction of the diſturbing or impelling force is always in a plane paſſing through the axis and the diſturbing body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With ſuch limitations therefore we propoſe the following problem</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let G (ſig. 14.) be the centre of gravity of a body in free ſpace, which is impelled by an external force </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">f,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">acting in the fine FP, which does not paſs through the&nbsp;centre. Ret </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font0"> be the number of equal particles in the&nbsp;body, or its quantity of matter. Let the forcé </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font1"> be</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ſuch, that it would communicate to the body the velocity </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">v ;</span><span class="font0"> that is, would cauſe the centre to move with the velocity </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">v.</span><span class="font0"> It may be expreffed by the quantity&nbsp;of motion which it produces, that is, by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m v,</span><span class="font0"> and it&nbsp;would produce the velocity </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m v</span><span class="font0"> on one particle. It is&nbsp;required to determine the whole motion, progreſſive&nbsp;and rotatory, which it will produce, and the ſpace&nbsp;which it will deſcribe during one turn round its axis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Draw GI parallel and PGC perpendicular to FP, and let GI be taken for the meaſure of the progreſſive&nbsp;velocity </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">v.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It has been demonſtrated that the centre G will proceed in the direction GI with the velocity </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">v,</span><span class="font0"> and that the body will at the ſame time turn round an axis paſſing&nbsp;through G, perpendicular to the plane of the figure,&nbsp;every particle deſcribing circles in parallel planes round&nbsp;this axis, and with velocities of rotation proportional&nbsp;to their diſtances from it. There is therefore a certain&nbsp;diſtance GB, ſuch that the velocity with which a particle deſcribes its circumference is equal to the progreſſive velocity </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">v.</span><span class="font0"> Let BCD be this circumference.&nbsp;When the particle deſcribing this circumference is in&nbsp;the line CGP, and in that part of it which lies beyond&nbsp;P from G, its abſolute velocity muſt be double that </span><span class="font1">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the centre G ; but when it is in the oppoſite point C<sub>9&nbsp;</sub>its retrograde velocity being equal to the progreſſive&nbsp;velocity of the centre, it muſt be at reſt. In every poſition of the body, therefore, that point of the accompanying circumference which is at this extremity of the&nbsp;perpendicular drawn through the centre on the line of&nbsp;dire ion of the impelling force is at reſt. It is at that-initant a ſpontaneous centre of converſion, and the&nbsp;ſtraight line drawn through it perpendicular to the&nbsp;plane of the figure is then a ſpontaneous axis of converſion, and every particle is in a momentary ſtate </span><span class="font1">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">rotation round this axis, in directions perpendicular </span><span class="font1">to&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the lines drawn to the axis at right angles, and with&nbsp;velocities proportional to theſe diſtances ; and laſtly,&nbsp;the body advances in the direction GI through a ſpace&nbsp;equal to the circumference BCD, while it makes one&nbsp;turn round G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let A be one of the particles in the plane of the figure. Join AC, AG, AP. Draw </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ab, Ac, Ad </span><span class="font0">perpendicular to CP, CA, GA. The abſolute motion&nbsp;A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font0"> of A is compounded of the progreſſive motion A </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">h&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">common to the whole body and equal to GI, and the&nbsp;motion A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0"> of rotation round the . entre of gravity G.&nbsp;Therefore ſince A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0"> is equal to &lt;υ, and A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font0"> is the diagonal of a parallelogram given both in ſpecies and&nbsp;magnitude, it is alſo given, and (as appears alſo ſrom&nbsp;the reaſoning in art. 85.) it is to GI as CA to CG.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By the application of the force </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m v</span><span class="font0"> in the direction FP, every particle of the body is dragged out of its&nbsp;place, and exerts a reſiſtance equal to the motion which&nbsp;it acquires. A part of this force, which we may call&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m v,</span><span class="font0"> is employed in communicating the motion A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font0"> tΘ&nbsp;A. Therefore </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m v,</span><span class="font0"> which we have, and, from what has&nbsp;been lately ſhown, CG.: CA = GI : A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c, = v</span><span class="font0"> : A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c<sub>9</sub></span></p>
