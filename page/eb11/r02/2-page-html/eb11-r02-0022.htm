<p><span class="font1">it became customary for the bodies of the martyrs not to be buried, but preserved for the purpose of veneration. Already&nbsp;individual Christians began to possess themselves of portions&nbsp;of the bodies of martyrs, and to carry them about with them.&nbsp;Both these practices met with criticism and opposition, especially&nbsp;from the leading men of the Church. According to the testimony of Athanasius of Alexandria, the hermit Anthony decided&nbsp;that it should be held to be unlawful and impious to leave the&nbsp;bodies of the martyrs unburied </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Vita Ant.</span><span class="font1"> 90). In Carthage the&nbsp;archdeacon and later the bishop Caecilianus severely blamed a&nbsp;certain Lucilla for carrying about with her a relic which she used&nbsp;to kiss before receiving the Eucharist (Optatus, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De schism. Donat.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">i. 16). The compiler of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Acta S. Fructuosi<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font1">  a Spanish ecclesiastic, represents the martyred bishop as himself requesting the&nbsp;burial of his relics. But energetic as the opposition was, it was&nbsp;unsuccessful, and died out. For in the meantime opinion as to&nbsp;the efficacy of relics had undergone a transformation, parallel&nbsp;with the growth of the theory, which soon predominated in the&nbsp;Church, that material instruments are the vehicles of divine&nbsp;grace. When the Christians of Smyrna decided that the bones&nbsp;of the martyrs were of more worth than gold or gems, and when&nbsp;Origen </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Exh. ad mart.</span><span class="font1"> 50) spoke of the precious blood of the&nbsp;martyrs, they were thinking of the act of faith which the martyrs&nbsp;had accomplished by the sacrifice of their life. Now, on the&nbsp;other hand, the relic came to be looked upon as in itself a thing&nbsp;of value as the channel of miraculous divine powers. These&nbsp;ideas are set forth by Cyril of Jerusalem. He taught that a&nbsp;certain power dwelt in the body of the saint, even when the&nbsp;soul had departed from it; just as it was the instrument of&nbsp;the soul during life, so the power passed permanently into it&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Cat.</span><span class="font1"> xviii. 16). This was coming very near to a belief that&nbsp;objects which the saints had used during their life had also a&nbsp;share in their miraculous powers. And this conclusion Cyril&nbsp;had already come to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(loc. cit.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We can see how early this estimate of relics became general from the fact that the former hesitation as to whether they&nbsp;should be venerated as sacred died out during the 4th century.&nbsp;The Fathers of the Greek Church especially were united in&nbsp;recommending the veneration of relics. All the great theologians&nbsp;of the 4th and 5th centuries may be quoted as evidence of this:&nbsp;Eusebius of Caesarea </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Praep. Ev.</span><span class="font1"> xiii.n), Gregory of Nazianzus&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Oral, in Cypr.</span><span class="font1"> 17), Gregory of Nyssa </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Oral, de S. Theod. mart.),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Basil of Caesarea </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Ep.</span><span class="font1"> ii. 197), Chrysostom </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Laud. DrosidiO,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Theodoret of Cyrus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Inps. 67,</span><span class="font1"> ir), &amp;c. John of Damascus, the&nbsp;great exponent of dogma in the 8th century, gave expression&nbsp;to the result of a uniform development which had been going&nbsp;on for centuries when he taught that Christ offers the relics to&nbsp;Christians as means of salvation. They must not be looked&nbsp;upon as something that is dead; for through them all good&nbsp;things come to those who pray with faith. Why should it&nbsp;seem impossible to believe in this power of the relics, when water&nbsp;could be made to gush from </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font1">rock in the desert? </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Defide&nbsp;orthod.</span><span class="font1"> iv. 15).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Such was the theory; and the practice was in harmony with it. Throughout the whole of the Eastern Church the veneration&nbsp;of relics prevailed. Nobody hesitated to divide up the bodies&nbsp;of the saints in order to afford as many portions of them as&nbsp;possible. They were shared among the inhabitants of cities&nbsp;and villages, Theodoret tells us, and cherished by everybody&nbsp;as healers and physicians for both body and soul (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dectir. Graec.&nbsp;aff.</span><span class="font1"> 8). The transition from the true relic to the hallowed object&nbsp;was especially common. Jerusalem, as early as the time of&nbsp;Eusebius, rejoiced in the possession of the .episcopal chair of&nbsp;James the Just </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Hist. eccl.</span><span class="font1"> vii. 19); and as late as the 4th century&nbsp;was discovered the most important of the relics of Christ, the&nbsp;cross which was alleged to have been His. Cyril of Jerusalem&nbsp;already remarks that the whole world was filled with portions&nbsp;of the wood of the cross </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Cat.</span><span class="font1"> iv. 10).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The development which the veneration of relics underwent in the West did not differ essentially from that in the East.&nbsp;Here also the idea came to prevail that the body of the saint,&nbsp;or a portion of it£was possessed of healing and protective power&nbsp;(Paulinus of Nola, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Poem.</span><span class="font1"> xix. 14 et seq., xxvii. 443). The&nbsp;objection raised by the Aquitanian presbyter Vigilantius (c. 400)&nbsp;to the belief that the souls of the martyrs to a certain extent&nbsp;clung to their ashes, and heard the prayers of those who approached them, appeared to his contemporaries to be frivolous;&nbsp;and he nowhere met with any support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The only doubt which was felt was as to whether the bodies of the saints should be divided, and removed from their original&nbsp;resting-place. Both practices were forbidden by law under&nbsp;the emperor Theodosius I. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Cod. Theodos,</span><span class="font1"> ix. 17, 7), and the&nbsp;division of the bodies of martyrs into pieces was prohibited&nbsp;for centuries. Even Pope Gregory I., in a letter to the empress&nbsp;Constantia, disapproved it </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Ep.</span><span class="font1"> iv. 30). Ambrose of Milan, by&nbsp;the discovery of the relics of Protasius and Gervasius (cf.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ep.</span><span class="font1"> 22 and Augustine, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Confess,</span><span class="font1"> ix. 7), started in the West the&nbsp;long series of discoveries and translations of hitherto unknown&nbsp;relics. His example was followed, to name only the best&nbsp;known instances, by Bishop Theodore of Octodurum (now&nbsp;Martigny in the Vaud), who discovered the relics of the Theban&nbsp;legion which was alleged to have been destroyed by the emperor&nbsp;Maximian on account of its belief in the Christian faith (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Passio Acaun. Mart.</span><span class="font1"> 16), and by Clematius, a citizen of&nbsp;Cologne, to whom the virgin martyrs of this city revealed&nbsp;themselves (Kraus, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Inschriften der Rhcinlande,</span><span class="font1"> No. 294), afterwards to be known as St Ursula and her eleven thousand&nbsp;virgins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The West was much poorer in relics than the East. Rome, it is true, possessed in the bodies of Peter and Paul a treasure&nbsp;the virtue of which outshone all the sacred treasures of the&nbsp;East. But many other places were entirely wanting in relics.&nbsp;By the discoveries which we have mentioned their number&nbsp;was notably increased. But the longing for these pledges&nbsp;of the divine assistance was insatiable. In order to satisfy&nbsp;it relics were made by placing pieces of cloth on the graves&nbsp;of the saints, which were afterwards taken to their homes&nbsp;and venerated by the pilgrims. The same purpose was served&nbsp;by oil taken from the lamps burning at the graves, flowers from&nbsp;the altars, water from some holy well, pieces of the garments of&nbsp;saints, earth from Jerusalem, and especially keys which had&nbsp;been laid on the grave of St Peter at Rome. All these things&nbsp;were not looked upon as mementoes, but the conviction prevailed that they were informed by a miraculous power, which&nbsp;had passed into them through contact with that which was&nbsp;originally sacred (cf. Greg. Tur. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Glor. mart.</span><span class="font1"> i. 25; Greg. I.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ep.</span><span class="font1"> iv. 29, No. 30). A dishonest means of satisfying the&nbsp;craving for relics was that of forging them, and how common&nbsp;this became can be gathered from the many complaints about&nbsp;spurious relics (Sulp. Sev. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vita Mart.</span><span class="font1"> 8; Aug. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De op. mon.</span><span class="font1"> 28;&nbsp;Greg. I. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ep.</span><span class="font1"> iv. 30, &amp;c.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But in the long run these substitutes for relics did not satisfy the Christians of the West, and, following the example of&nbsp;the Eastern Church, they took to dividing the bodies of the&nbsp;saints. Medieval relics in the West also were mostly portions&nbsp;of the bodies of saints or of things which they had used during&nbsp;their lives. The veneration of relics also received a strong&nbsp;impulse from the fact that the Church required that a relic&nbsp;should be deposited in every altar. Among the first of those&nbsp;whom we know to have attached importance to the placing of&nbsp;relics in churches is Ambrose of Milan </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Ep. 22),</span><span class="font1"> and the 7th&nbsp;general council of Nicaea (787) forbade the consecration of&nbsp;churches in which relics were not present, under pain of ex-communication. This has remained part of the law of the&nbsp;Roman Catholic Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The most famous relics discovered during the middle ages were those of the apostle James at St Jago de Compostella&nbsp;in Spain (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pilgrimage),</span><span class="font1"> the bodies of the three kings, which&nbsp;were brought from Milan to Cologne in 1164 by the emperor&nbsp;Fredierick I. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Chron. reg. Colon,</span><span class="font1"> for the year 1164), the so-called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sudarium</span><span class="font1"> of St Veronica, which from the 12th century&nbsp;onwards was preserved in the Capella Santa Maria ad praesepe&nbsp;of St Peter’s in Rome (see Dobschiitz, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Christusbilder,</span><span class="font1"> p. 218 seq.),&nbsp;and the seamless robe of Christ, the possession of which lent</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
