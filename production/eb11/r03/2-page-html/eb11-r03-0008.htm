<p><span class="font1">methods, and when the lords appellant had lost credit, asserted himself constitutionally by dismissing Gloucester’s supporters&nbsp;from office, and appointing in their place well-approved men&nbsp;like William of Wykeham. In the next parliament of 1390&nbsp;the king showed himself ready to meet and conciliate his&nbsp;subjects. The simultaneous return of John of Gaunt from&nbsp;Spain put a check on Gloucester’s ambition. For seven years&nbsp;Richard ruled constitutionally and on the whole well. The&nbsp;opposition was quiescent except for two outbreaks by Arundel:&nbsp;the first was a violent attack on John of Gaunt, which rather&nbsp;strengthened Richard’s position; the second was a wanton&nbsp;insult to the king at the funeral of his queen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In January 1383 Richard had married Anne of Bohemia (1366-1394), daughter of the emperor Charles IV. The marriage,&nbsp;though childless, was happy; had Anne lived or borne a son&nbsp;the course of events might have been different. Her death&nbsp;on the 7th of June 1394 was a great shock to Richard, and&nbsp;incidentally had important consequences. Richard sought&nbsp;distraction by an expedition to Ireland, the first visit of an&nbsp;English king for more than two centuries. In his policy there&nbsp;he showed a wise statesmanship. At the same time he was&nbsp;negotiating for a permanent peace with France, which was&nbsp;finally arranged in October 1396 to include his own marriage&nbsp;with Isabella, daughter of Charles VI., a child of seven.&nbsp;Gloucester criticized the peace openly, and there was some&nbsp;show of opposition in the parliament of February 1397. But&nbsp;there was nothing to foreshadow the sudden stroke by which&nbsp;in July Richard arrested Gloucester and his chief supporters,&nbsp;the earls of Arundel and Warwick. The others of the five&nbsp;lords appellant, Henry of Bolingbroke afterwards King&nbsp;Henry IV., and the earl of Nottingham, now supported the&nbsp;king. Richard’s action was apparently in deliberate revenge&nbsp;for the events of 1387-88. Gloucester, after a forced confession, died in prison at Calais, smothered by his nephew’s&nbsp;orders. Arundel in a packed parliament was condemned and&nbsp;executed; his brother Thomas archbishop of Canterbury was&nbsp;exiled. The king’s friends, including Nottingham and Boling-broke, made dukes of Norfolk and Hereford, were all promoted&nbsp;in title and estate. Richard himself was rewarded for ten&nbsp;years’ patience by the possession of absolute power. He&nbsp;might perhaps have established it if he could have exercised&nbsp;it with moderation. But he declared that the laws of England&nbsp;were in his mouth, and supported his court in wanton luxury&nbsp;by arbitrary methods of taxation. By the exile of Norfolk&nbsp;and Hereford in September 1398 he seemed to have removed&nbsp;the last persons he need fear. He was so confident that in&nbsp;May 1399 he paid a second visit to Ireland, taking with him&nbsp;all his most trusted adherents. Thus  when Henry landed&nbsp;at Ravenspur in July he found only half-hearted opposition,&nbsp;and when Richard himself returned it was too late. Ultimately&nbsp;Richard surrendered to Henry at Flint on the 19th of August,&nbsp;promising to abdicate if his life was spared. He was taken&nbsp;to London riding behind his rival with indignity. On the&nbsp;30th of September he signed in the Tower a deed of abdication,&nbsp;wherein he owned himself insufficient and useless, reading it&nbsp;first aloud with a cheerful mien and ending with a request&nbsp;that his cousin would be good lord to him. The parliament&nbsp;ordered that Richard should be kept close prisoner, and he&nbsp;was sent secretly to Pontefract. There in February 1400 he&nbsp;died: no doubt of the rigour of his winter imprisonment,&nbsp;rather than by actual murder as alleged in the story adopted&nbsp;by Shakespeare. The mystery of Richard’s death led to&nbsp;rumours that he had escaped, and an impostor pretending to&nbsp;be Richard lived during many years under the protection of&nbsp;the Scottish government. But no doubt it was the real Richard&nbsp;who was buried without state in 1400 at King’s Langley, and&nbsp;honourably reinterred by Henry V. at Westminster in 1413.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Richard II. is a character of strange contradictions. It is difficult to reconcile the precocious boy of 1381 with the wayward and passionate youth of the next few years. Even if it&nbsp;be supposed that he dissembled his real opinions during the&nbsp;period of his constitutional rule, it is impossible to believe that&nbsp;the apparent indifference which he showed in his fall was the&nbsp;mere acting of a part. His violent outbursts of passion perhaps&nbsp;give the best clue to a mercurial and impulsive nature, easily&nbsp;elated and depressed. He had real ability, and in his Irish&nbsp;policy, and in the preference which he gave to it over continental&nbsp;adventure, showed a statesmanship in advance of his time.&nbsp;But this, in spite of his lofty theory of kingship, makes it all&nbsp;the more difficult to explain his extravagant bearing in his&nbsp;prosperity. His fall was due to the triumph of national right&nbsp;over absolute government, but it was his personal conduct&nbsp;which made it inevitable. In appearance Richard was tall&nbsp;and handsome, if effeminate. He had some literary tastes,&nbsp;which were shown in fitful patronage of Chaucer, Gower and&nbsp;Froissart. His fancy for splendid dress may have been due&nbsp;to an artistic sense, which found better expression in his great&nbsp;buildings of Westminster Hall and Abbey. Richard’s second&nbsp;queen, Isabella (1389-1409), was born in Paris on the 9th of&nbsp;November 1389, and was married to the English king at Calais&nbsp;in October, or November, 1396, but on account of the bride’s&nbsp;youth the marriage was never consummated. When Richard&nbsp;lost his crown in 1399 Isabella was captured by Henry IV.’s&nbsp;partisans and sent to Sonning, near Reading, while her father,&nbsp;Charles VI., asked in vain for the restoration of his daughter&nbsp;and of her dowry. In 1401 she was allowed to return to&nbsp;France; in 1406 she became the wife of the poet, Charles,&nbsp;duke of Orleans, and she died on the 13th of September 1409.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RICHARD IIL (1452-1485), king of England, youngest son of Richard, duke of York, by Cicely Neville, was born at Fothering-hay on the 2nd of October 1452. After the second battle of&nbsp;St Albans in February 1461, his mother sent him with his&nbsp;brother George for safety to Utrecht. They returned in April,&nbsp;and at the coronation of Edward IV. Richard was created duke&nbsp;of Gloucester. As a mere child he had no importance till 1469-1470, when he supported his brother against Warwick, shared his&nbsp;exile and took part in his triumphant return. He distinguished&nbsp;himself at Barnet and Tewkesbury; according to the Lancastrian&nbsp;story, after the latter battle he murdered the young Edward&nbsp;of Wales in cold blood; this is discredited by the authority of&nbsp;Warkworth </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Chronicle,</span><span class="font1"> p. 18); but Richard may have had a&nbsp;share in Edward’s death during the fighting. He cannot be so&nbsp;fully cleared of complicity in the murder of Henry VI., which&nbsp;probably took place at the Tower on the night of the 21-22&nbsp;of May, when Richard was certainly present there. Richard&nbsp;shared to the full in his brother’s prosperity. He had large&nbsp;grants of lands and office, and by marrying Anne (1456-1485),&nbsp;the younger daughter of Warwick, secured a share in the Neville&nbsp;inheritance. This was distasteful to George, duke of Clarence,&nbsp;who was already married to the elder sister, Isabel. The rivalry&nbsp;of the two brothers caused a quarrel which was never appeased.&nbsp;Richard does not, however, seem to have been directly responsible for the death of Clarence in 1478; Sir Thomas More,&nbsp;who is a hostile witness, says that he resisted it openly “ how-beit somewhat (as men deemed) more faintly than he that were&nbsp;heartily minded to his wealth.” Richard’s share of the Neville&nbsp;inheritance was chiefly in the north, and he resided usually at&nbsp;Middleham in Yorkshire. In May 1480 he was made the king’s&nbsp;lieutenant-general in the north, and in 1482 commanded a&nbsp;successful invasion of Scotland. His administration was good,&nbsp;and brought him well-deserved popularity. On Edward’s&nbsp;death he was kept informed of events in London by William,&nbsp;Lord Hastings, who shared his dislike of the Woodville influence.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
