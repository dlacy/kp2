<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">According to the agricultural returns for 1884 the total area under crops was 95,353, a percentage of 603־57) 8־ in 1874). The&nbsp;area under corn crops in 1884 was 17,502 acres; under green&nbsp;crops, 6,683 acres ; under rotation of grasses, 22,997 acres ; under&nbsp;permanent pasture, 47,880 acres; orchards and market-gardens, 158&nbsp;acres ; and woodland, 5424. Of the corn land more than four-fifths&nbsp;was under oats, which occupied 14,132 acres, while 2229 were under&nbsp;wheat, and only 178 under barley. Potatoes were grown on 4351&nbsp;acres, and turnips and swedes on 2332 ; while under beans, rye,&nbsp;vetches, &amp;c., there are about 1300 acres annually. The total&nbsp;number of horses in 1884 was 3331 ; the number of cattle to every&nbsp;100 acres under cultivation was 288־, the average for Scotland&nbsp;being 23'6. The large towns in the county and neighbourhood&nbsp;account for a great number of cattle being kept for dairy and&nbsp;feeding purposes. The number of sheep to every 100 acres under&nbsp;cultivation was 33T, the average for Scotland being 145T. The&nbsp;number of pigs was 1952. According to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Miscellaneous Statistics&nbsp;of the United Kingdom</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1879) 5735 proprietors owned 155,321 acres&nbsp;with an estimated gross rental of £990,898. Sir M. R. Shaw&nbsp;Stewart possessed 24,951 acres, Allan Gilmour of Eaglesham 16,516,&nbsp;A. A. Spiers of Elderslie 11,259, H. Lee Harvey of Castlesemple&nbsp;6500, Sir W. Stirling Maxwell 4773, Lord Blantyre 4449, Duncan&nbsp;Darroch of Gourock 4248, and IV. Mure of Caldwell 3624.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Besides the coal, iron, and oil industries already mentioned, the county has extensive, varied, and valuable manufactures, of which&nbsp;the chief are noticed in the separate articles on Greenock and&nbsp;Paisley. Elsewhere there are chemical works, engineering works,&nbsp;foundries, and bleaching, dyeing, and weaving works. There are&nbsp;throughout the shire a large number of excellent roads; and numerous lines and branches of the Caledoniau and the Glasgowand South-Western systems afford ample railway communication along the&nbsp;centre, north, and west for both general traffic and minerals. The&nbsp;population has risen from 78,501 in 1801 to 216,947 in 1871&nbsp;and to 263,374 in 1881 (126,743 males, 136,631 females), more than&nbsp;100,000 of the increase having taken place between 1851 and 1881.&nbsp;Of the whole number 49,681 men and 21,734 women were engaged&nbsp;in industrial handicrafts or dealt in manufactured substances, and&nbsp;of these 7741 men and 15,547 women were connected with the&nbsp;making of textile fabrics, while 7986 men and 172 women were&nbsp;connected with the working of mineral substances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Redistribution Act passed in 1885 extended the parliamentary representation of the county from one to two members. The only royal burgh is Renfrew, which is separately noticed, as are&nbsp;also the parliamentary burghs of Greenock and Paisley. The&nbsp;county also contains part of the south side of Glasgow and its&nbsp;suburbs, the parliamentary burgh of Port Glasgow, the police&nbsp;burghs of Pollokshaws, Gourock, and Johnstone, and a number of&nbsp;small towns and villages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Historically Renfrewshire first appears as part of the territory of the Damnonii, and thereafter it was part of the British kingdom&nbsp;of Strathclyde. The western part, then known as Strathgryfe, was&nbsp;granted by David I. to Walter, the first high stewai-d of Scotland,&nbsp;and the Stewarts had long a local connexion with it. Somerled,&nbsp;Lord of the Isles, was defeated and slain in the neighbourhood of&nbsp;the burgh of Renfrew in 1164 ; and Marjory Bruce is said to have&nbsp;been killed by a fall from her horse at Knock Hill between Paisley&nbsp;and Renfrew in 1316. In 1404 the county, which had previously&nbsp;formed part of Lanark, was erected into a separate jurisdiction by&nbsp;Robert III., who created his son James baron of Renfrew, a title&nbsp;still held by the eldest son of the reigning sovereign. In the end&nbsp;of the 17th century the district was famous for its witches ; and&nbsp;in 1685, after the failure of the earl of Argyll’s ill-conducted enterprise, the earl himself was taken prisoner on the bank of the&nbsp;White Cart opposite Inchinnan church, at the spot marked by&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Argyll Stone,” now within the policies of Blythswood House.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RENFREW, a royal and parliamentary burgli and the county town of the above county, is situated in the northeast near the south bank of the Clyde, connected with&nbsp;which is a small harbour. The main part of the town is&nbsp;gathered round four streets branching out from an open</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">duces very heavy crops, a large extent being under wheat. Although miueral workings have injured agriculture in several localities, the&nbsp;large towns in the county and neighbourhood have stimulated improvements, and the arable area has steadily increased. The following table gives a classification of holdings in 1875 and 1880 :—</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">space called the cross. The town-hall, erected in 1871-73, and restored after partial destruction by fire in 1878, has&nbsp;a massive square tower rising to a height of 105 feet.&nbsp;The railway station is 6 miles west of Glasgow. The&nbsp;industries are connected with two shipbuilding yards, a&nbsp;chemical work, a forge, a dye work, and weaving. Population in 1881, 5115.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The town, which is spoken of as a burgh in 1160, seems to have been in the 16th and early in the 17th century the principal port&nbsp;on the Clyde, one branch of which ran in a channel, now silted up,&nbsp;close behind the houses on the north side of High Street. The&nbsp;original castle of the Stewards seems to have stood on the island&nbsp;called “ The King’s Inch,” between the two channels of the river.&nbsp;Renfrew is one of the Kilmarnock group of parliamentary burghs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RENI, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Guido </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(1575-1642), </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">prime master in the Bolognese school of painting, and one of the most admired&nbsp;artists of the period of incipient decadence in Italy, was&nbsp;born at Calvenzano near Bologna on 4th November 1575.&nbsp;He is most usually named Guido. His father was </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">musician of repute, a player on the flageolet; he wished&nbsp;to bring the lad up to perform on the harpsichord. At a&nbsp;very childish age, however, Guido displayed a determined&nbsp;bent towards the art of form, scribbling some attempt at&nbsp;a drawing here, there, and everywhere. He was only&nbsp;nine years of age when Denis Calvart took notice of him,&nbsp;received him into his academy of design by the father’s&nbsp;permission, and rapidly brought him forward, so that by&nbsp;the age of thirteen Guido had already attained marked&nbsp;proficiency. Albani and Domenichino became soon afterwards pupils in the same academy. With Albani Guido&nbsp;was very intimate up to the earlier period of manhood,&nbsp;but they afterwards became rivals, both as painters and as&nbsp;heads of ateliers, with a good deal of asperity on Albani’s&nbsp;part; Domenichino was also pitted against Reni by the&nbsp;policy of Annibale Caracci. Guido was still in the&nbsp;academy of Calvart when he began frequenting the opposition school kept by Lodovico Caracci, whose style, far in&nbsp;advance of that of the Flemish painter, he dallied with.&nbsp;This exasperated Calvart. Him Guido, not yet twenty&nbsp;years of age, cheerfully quitted, transferring himself&nbsp;openly to the Caracci academy, in which he soon became&nbsp;prominent, being equally skilful and ambitious. He had&nbsp;not been a year with the Caracci when a work of his&nbsp;excited the wonder of Agostino and the jealousy of&nbsp;Annibale. Lodovico cherished him, and frequently painted&nbsp;him as an angel, for the youthful Reni was extremely&nbsp;handsome. After a while, however, Lodovico also felt&nbsp;himself nettled, and he patronized the competing talents&nbsp;of Guercino. On one occasion Guido had made a copy of&nbsp;Annibale’s Descent from the Cross; Annibale was asked&nbsp;to retouch it, and, finding nothing to do, exclaimed&nbsp;pettishly, “He knows more than enough ” (“Costui ne sa&nbsp;troppo”). On another occasion Lodovico, consulted as&nbsp;umpire, lowered a price which Reni asked for an early&nbsp;picture. This slight determined the young man to be a&nbsp;pupil no more. He left the Caracci, and started on his&nbsp;own account as a competitor in the race for patronage and&nbsp;fame. A renowned work, the story of Callisto and Diana,&nbsp;had been completed before he left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Guido was faithful to the eclectic principle of the Bolognese school of painting. He had appropriated some-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
