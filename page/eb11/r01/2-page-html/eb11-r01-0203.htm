<p><span class="font1">RECTOR (Lat. for “ruler,” “guide,” &amp;c., from regere, “rule”), a title given to the bearers of certain ecclesiastical&nbsp;and academical offices. In the Roman empire, after Constantine, the title </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rector</span><span class="font1"> was borne by governors of provinces&nbsp;subordinate to the prefects or exarchs. In the middle ages it&nbsp;was given to certain secular officials, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> the podestas of some&nbsp;Italian towns, but more especially to the heads of the universities, the representatives and rulers of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">universitas magistrorum et scholarium,</span><span class="font1"> elected usually for a very short time.&nbsp;After the humanistic movement of the Renaissance the style&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rector</span><span class="font1"> was also given to the chief masters of schools containing&nbsp;several classes, and in some parts of Germany (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> Saxony,&nbsp;Württemberg) it is still thus used instead of the more modern&nbsp;title of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Director.</span><span class="font1"> Rector is also still the title of the heads of&nbsp;the Scottish universities (Lord Rector), who are elected for&nbsp;three years, and of the German universities (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rector Magnificus),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">in which the office is held for a year by a representative of each&nbsp;faculty in turn. In those German universities where the&nbsp;rectorship is held by the sovereign (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rector Magnificentissimus),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the acting head is known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prorectοr.</span><span class="font1"> “ Rector ” is also the&nbsp;title of the heads of Exeter and Lincoln Colleges, Oxford. The&nbsp;heads of all Jesuit colleges are “ rectors.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As an ecclesiastical title </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rector</span><span class="font1"> was once loosely used for rulers of the Church generally, whether bishops, abbots or&nbsp;parish priests (see Du Cange, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rectores ecclesiarum).</span><span class="font1"> The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rectores&nbsp;Apostolici Patrimonii</span><span class="font1"> were clerics of the Roman Curia charged&nbsp;with the duty of looking after the interests of the patrimony&nbsp;òf St Peter. The ecclesiastical title </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rector,</span><span class="font1"> however, became&nbsp;ultimately confined in certain parts of Europe (Poland, Spain&nbsp;and notably England) to the office of a priest having a cure of&nbsp;souls. In its English use it is thus synonymous with “ curate’’&nbsp;in the sense used in the Prayer Book. In the middle ages&nbsp;a large number of rectories were held by religious houses,&nbsp;which drew the bulk of the tithes and appointed vicars to do&nbsp;the work. Hence the modem distinction in England between&nbsp;rectors and vicars. A rector is incumbent of a benefice never&nbsp;held under a monastery, and he receives all the tithes; a vicar&nbsp;(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> of an ancient benefice) draws only such tithes as were left&nbsp;to the benefice by the religious house which held it. On the&nbsp;suppression of the monasteries the “ great tithes ” were often&nbsp;bestowed by the crown on laymen, who, as owning the rectorial&nbsp;tithes, were and are known as “ lay rectors.’’ It follows that,&nbsp;rectories being usually richer than vicarages, the style of&nbsp;“ rector ’’ is in England slightly more dignified than that of&nbsp;“ vicar.’’ In the American Protestant Episcopal Church the&nbsp;incumbents of churches are called rectors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RECUSANT (from Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">recusare,</span><span class="font1"> to refuse), the name, in English history, given in the 16th and 17th centuries to those persons&nbsp;who persisted in refusing to attend the services of the English&nbsp;Church, and particularly to those of the Roman Catholic&nbsp;faith (see Roman Catholic Church, § </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">English Law).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REDAN, in fortification, a work of V-shape presenting a salient angle towards the expected attack. The gorge (rear) of a redan&nbsp;is open. When unsupported by other works, it has the disadvantage that its fire is divergent and but few guns can be&nbsp;brought to bear directly towards the front. Further, both its&nbsp;faces are usually open to enfilade. Redans were therefore almost&nbsp;always used in conjunction with other works, one of the most&nbsp;common forms being the “ lines of redans ’’ used as field works.&nbsp;These consisted of lengths of plain trenches facing the front,&nbsp;with redans at intervals along the line. In the present day&nbsp;the term redan is loosely applied to works merely possessing&nbsp;saliency, as in the case of the celebrated bastions Nos. 3 and 2&nbsp;at Sevastopol in 1854-55, usually called the “Redan’’ and&nbsp;“ Little Redan ’’ respectively (see Crimean War). The&nbsp;“ Redan ” was a large work of irregular outline, generally&nbsp;resembling a redan, but having the salient angle blunted or&nbsp;rounded off and the side faces broken into several minor fronts&nbsp;so as to obtain a field of fire in many directions. (See Fortification and Siegecraft.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RED BANK, a borough of Monmouth county, New Jersey, U.S.A., on an estuary known as Navesink river, at the head of&nbsp;navigation, about 6 m. W. of the Atlantic Ocean, and about&nbsp;25 m. S. of New York City. Pop. (1905) 6263; (1910) 7398.&nbsp;Red Bank is served by the Central of New Jersey and the&nbsp;Pennsylvania railways, and by steamboats to New York, and is&nbsp;connected with the neighbouring towns by electric lines. It is a&nbsp;residential suburb of New York City and a summer resort. In&nbsp;the winter ice-boating is a popular amusement, and Red Bank&nbsp;has fish and oyster industries of some importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The name Red Bank was applied to this locality as early as 1734, and in 1781 there were several buildings within the limits&nbsp;of the present borough. Red Bank was incorporated as a town&nbsp;in 1870 and became a borough in 1908. Near Red Bank was&nbsp;established in 1843 the North American phalanx, a Fourierite&nbsp;community, with a capital of about $8000 and 112 members,&nbsp;on about 673 acres; it was financially the most successful and&nbsp;the longest lived of the Fourierist phalansteries in America,&nbsp;but broke up in 1855 because of internal dissensions, following&nbsp;a fire which destroyed the mills.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REDBREAST,@@<sup>2</sup> or Robin, perhaps the favourite among English birds because of its pleasing colour, its sagacity and&nbsp;fearlessness of man, and its cheerful song, even in winter.&nbsp;In July and August the hedgerows of the southern counties of&nbsp;England are beset with redbreasts, not in flocks, but each&nbsp;individual keeping its own distance from the next@@<sup>3</sup>—all, however, on their way to cross the Channel. On the European&nbsp;continent the migration is still more marked, and the redbreast&nbsp;on its autumnal and vernal passages is the object of bird-catchers, since its value as a delicacy has long been recognized.&nbsp;Even those redbreasts which stay in Britain during the winter&nbsp;are subject to a migratory movement. The first sharp frost&nbsp;makes them change their habitation, and a heavy fall of snow&nbsp;drives them towards the homesteads for food. The redbreast&nbsp;exhibits a curious uncertainty of temperament in regard to&nbsp;its nesting habits. At times it wifi place the utmost confidence&nbsp;in man, and at times show the greatest jealousy. The nest&nbsp;is usually built of moss and dead leaves, with a moderate lining&nbsp;of hair. In this arc laid from five to seven white eggs, sprinkled&nbsp;or blotched with light red.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Besides the British Islands, the redbreast (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Motacilla rubecula </span><span class="font1">of Linnaeus and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Erithacus rubecula</span><span class="font1"> of modem authors) is&nbsp;generally dispersed over the continent of Europe, and is in&nbsp;winter found in the oases of the Sahara. Its eastern limits&nbsp;are not well determined. In northern Persia it is replaced by&nbsp;a nearly allied form, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Erithacus hyrcanus,</span><span class="font1"> distinguishable by its</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> The borough of Red Bank should be distinguished from a place of the same name in Gloucester county, New Jersey, about 6 m.&nbsp;below Camden, on the Delaware river, nearly opposite the mouth&nbsp;of the Schuylkill river, which was the site of Fort Mercer in the&nbsp;American War of Independence. Fort Mercer, with Fort Mifflin&nbsp;(nearly opposite it on an island in the Delaware), prevented the&nbsp;co-operation of the British navy with the army which had occupied&nbsp;Philadelphia in September. On the 22nd of October Fort Mercer,&nbsp;held by 600 men under Col. Christopher Greene (1737-1781), was&nbsp;unsuccessfully attacked by a force of about 2500 men, mostly&nbsp;Hessians, under Col. Carl Emil Kurt von Donop, the Hessians losing about 400 men, including Donop, who was mortally wounded.&nbsp;The British naval force was prevented by the &quot;Pennsylvania&nbsp;navy ” under John Hazelwood (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font0"> 1726-1800) from taking part in&nbsp;the attack; two British ships were destroyed; and the fire from&nbsp;the American vessels added to the discomfiture of the Hessians.&nbsp;On the 15th of November Fort Mifflin was destroyed after a five&nbsp;days’ bombardment from batteries on the Pennsylvania shore and&nbsp;from British vessels in the rear; and on the 20th Fort Mercer was&nbsp;abandoned before Cornwallis’s approach and was destroyed by&nbsp;the British. Philadelphia was then put in touch with Admiral&nbsp;Howe’s fleet and with New York City. Near Red Bank </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">monument to Christopher Greene was erected in 1829.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@2</sup> English colonists in distant lands have applied the common nickname of the redbreast to other birds that are not immediately&nbsp;allied to it.
