<p><span class="font0">the pope. That would bar out for ever all risk of a conflict of clerical wills. Fortune favoured his enterprise. The French&nbsp;bishops of the age of Bossuet had been a powerful estate of the&nbsp;realm, able in some degree to make their own terms with the&nbsp;king himself; their successors in the 19th century were a mere&nbsp;group of salaried public officials. Still more significant&nbsp;changes took place across the Rhine. An appreciable part&nbsp;of the Holy Roman Empire had been in the hands of&nbsp;clerical rulers. At their head stood the electors of Cologne,&nbsp;Mainz and Treves, temporal princes of no mean rank,&nbsp;usually chosen from the cadets of royal houses. But in&nbsp;1803 electors and prince bishops came to an end. Their&nbsp;domains were secularized, and divided up among their lay&nbsp;neighbours, Prussia securing the lion’s share. Thenceforward&nbsp;the German bishops became mere officials, as in France,&nbsp;and Rome had no cause to fear the opposition of another&nbsp;Febronius.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Still remoter was the danger of another Louis XIV. or Joseph II. The time had gone by when sovereigns could decide what&nbsp;particular shade of Catholicism their subjects should assume.&nbsp;Everywhere there was a growing belief that a man’s religious&nbsp;tenets were his private affair, with which the state had&nbsp;nothing to do; and that a government only made itself ridiculous&nbsp;if it attempted to lay down which creeds were true and which&nbsp;were false. Hence the clergy were left to do as they pleased,&nbsp;so long as they respected the law of the land; and most of the&nbsp;modern collisions between Church and State have occurred on&nbsp;the debateable ground where their respective spheres overlap,&nbsp;over questions concerning education or the marriage-laws.&nbsp;Noticeable among these quarrels were the so-called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kölnische&nbsp;Wirren</span><span class="font0"> of 1837-40, when the archbishop of Cologne defied the&nbsp;Prussian government over the question of “ mixed marriages, ”&nbsp;and paid for his rashness by a long imprisonment. Such&nbsp;conflicts did much to increase the power of the pope, by encouraging local Churches to turn to him as their protector. To ride&nbsp;rough-shod over individual bishops was nothing to Prussia;&nbsp;but to quarrel mortally with Rome was a serious matter for a&nbsp;sovereign reigning over millions of Catholic subjects. Even&nbsp;more successful were the papal incursions on to a more ethereal&nbsp;domain. Ever since the time of Kant and Goethe, the intellectual leadership of Europe had been slowly passing into the&nbsp;hands of the Germans, and Catholic theology shared the lot of&nbsp;other branches of learning. But the German divines were&nbsp;much more in touch with the world at large than were their&nbsp;brethren in Italy or France; and more than one interesting&nbsp;attempt was made to bring theology into line with modern&nbsp;schools of thought. Joseph von Gorres read the medieval&nbsp;mystics in the light of the newer mysticism of Schelling. Hermes&nbsp;of Bonn defended Catholicism from the standpoint of Kant&nbsp;and Fichte. Continuing his work on a bolder scale,&nbsp;the Viennese priest Günther undertook to show that&nbsp;the articles of the Christian creed are only a rough-and-ready popular statement of the conclusions of&nbsp;philosophy. Of more enduring value have been the researches&nbsp;of the historical school, founded by John Adam Möhler (1796-1838), whose famous </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Symbolik</span><span class="font0"> (1832) was perhaps the heaviest&nbsp;literary blow ever dealt at the Reformation. On his early&nbsp;death his mantle fell on to the shoulders of Ignatius Dollinger&nbsp;(1799-1890). This school claimed that its methods, unlike&nbsp;those of Hermes and Günther, avoided all danger of speculative&nbsp;caprice. Catholicism was considered as an organic growth,&nbsp;developing from certain seminal principles in accordance with&nbsp;certain definite laws. The busmess of a sound theology was&nbsp;to discover and apply those laws, not to patch up fleeting compromises with the intellectual fashions of an age. On the other&nbsp;hand, the Historical School found but little favour at Rome.&nbsp;“ Truth, ” as MaIcbranche quaintly says, “ always has a few&nbsp;hairs on her chin ”; and the conclusions of sound&nbsp;learning must needs be slow, fragmentary and tentative.&nbsp;But Italian taste was all for bold, highly-coloured,&nbsp;slashing statements, that any one could understand;&nbsp;what it wanted was a method that should be at once intel</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">lectually impressive, and free from the usual clouds that beset the scholar’s path. It found what it asked for, when the Jesuits<sub>r&nbsp;</sub>whom Pius VII. had recalled to Efe (1814), revived the methods-of Aquinas and the medieval Schoolmen. Under the fostering&nbsp;care of Pius IX., this “ neo-Scholasticism ” spread from Italy&nbsp;to the German Catholic universities, and especially the seminaries of France. The secret of its power was that it gave scope&nbsp;for an immense amount of intellectual subtlety, and at the&nbsp;same time saved men from all danger of independent thought.&nbsp;Although a metaphysic, it was not, and did not pretend to be,&nbsp;an unbiased search for truth. It admittedly started by taking&nbsp;the truth of CathoEcism for granted; and its only object was&nbsp;to make intelEgible to reason the dogmas that faith already&nbsp;accepted. Thus the whole neo-Scholastic movement played&nbsp;straight into the hands of authority. So comprehensive were&nbsp;its methods, so self-confident its bearing, that those who had&nbsp;once fallen under its spell would never need to doubt or hesitate&nbsp;again. They knew exactly what to think on every conceivable&nbsp;subject; and there was smaU danger of their suspecting that&nbsp;there might be things in heaven and earth undreamed of in its&nbsp;philosophy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To the learned Rome might serve up authority with a garnish of neo-Scholastic metaphysics; for average mankind&nbsp;authority pure and simple was enough. Terrified out of their&nbsp;Eves at the way in which science and criticism were taking&nbsp;one theological citadel after another, the more militant section&nbsp;of the clergy declared war on thought itself. Not only&nbsp;was faith made independent of reason, but it was considered&nbsp;aE the purer, the less it owed to any kind of mental process.&nbsp;If it was a merit to believe without evidence, it was a shining&nbsp;virtue to beEeve in the teeth of evidence. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Credo, quia&nbsp;absurdum</span><span class="font0"> was applied, notably by the popular writers of&nbsp;the French Second Empire, in a fashion grotesquely literal&nbsp;enough to scandalize Tertullian himself. “ There had always,&nbsp;existed in France, as elsewhere, those who loved traditional&nbsp;stories of a marvellous nature, and tended to multiply the&nbsp;number which were presented as facts rather than legends.&nbsp;The existence of this school has always been inseparable·&nbsp;from the element of pious belief which enters so much into&nbsp;popular devotion. But in pre-Revolution days there had also&nbsp;been the critical school of the Maurists, which offered an&nbsp;alternative to minds averse from impEcit reliance on tradition.&nbsp;This had passed away, and was not yet replaced. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Acta&nbsp;sincera Martyrurnby</span><span class="font0"> Ruinart was replaced by the thoroughly&nbsp;uncritical and inexact </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Actes des martyrs</span><span class="font0"> of Gueranger. Church&nbsp;history was aUowed to be represented by such men as the Abbé&nbsp;Darras; and many French CathoEcs were ready to accept&nbsp;without question what the Bollandist Père de Smedt has not&nbsp;hesitated to caU the historical errors and Ees of Charles Barte-lemy. Incredible and unsupported stories in history, and&nbsp;extravagances in dogma were the order of the day. Those-traditions or doctrines which were most uncongenial to the-modern world were placed in strong relief; and the disparagement of the individual inteUect was extended to the disparagement of.scientific research itself ” (Wilfrid Ward, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Life of W. G.&nbsp;Ward,</span><span class="font0"> vol. ii.'p. 119). The faithful were encouraged to drown&nbsp;all tendency to thought in an ever-increasing flood of sensuous-emotionalism. In thirty years Pius IX. canonized more saints-than all his predecessors together for a century and a half.&nbsp;In 1854 he gave a great impulse to the cultus of the&nbsp;Virgin by proclaiming her Immactdate Conception&nbsp;a dogma of the Church (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Immaculate Conception).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the following year he imposed on Catholicism at large a special “ devotion ” to the Heart of Mary Immaculate.&nbsp;Next year he added a similar devotion to the Sacred Heart of&nbsp;Jesus (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sacred IÎeart).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That these things only widened the breach between the-Church and the outside wurld was of no account to Pius. Ever .since his return from Gaeta, he had made up his mind to a policy&nbsp;of no surrender; and the curtailment of his own dominions in&nbsp;i860 only made him the keener to denounce the iniquities of&nbsp;other rulers. In 1864 appeared the encyclical </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Quanta Cura<sub>v</sub></span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
