               <p>                   <label>ROME</label>
                    <hi rend="italic">(Roma),</hi> the capital of the modern kingdom of Italy, in
                    the province of Rome, on the river Tiber,miles N.E. from its mouth on the
                    Mediterranean. As formerly the centre of the ancient Roman republic and of the
                    Roman empire, and the headquarters of the Christian Church, Rome is unique among
                    historical cities, and its antiquarian interest far surpasses that of any other
                    locality in the world. In the following account the general subject of Rome is
                    treated broadly under two aspects, themselves subdivided. These are:—(1) the
                    topography and growth of the city of Rome, the evolution of which is traced from
                    the earliest times to the present, and (2) Roman history, <hi rend="italic"
                        >i.e.</hi> the political and social history of the Roman republic, empire
                    and medieval commune.</p>               <p>The nine or ten hills and ridges on which the city stands are formed of masses
                    of tufa or conglomerated sand and ashes thrown out by neighbouring volcanoes now
                    extinct, but active down to a very recent period. One group of these volcanoes
                    is that around Lago Bracciano, while another, still nearer to Rome, composes the
                    Alban Hills. That some at least of these craters have been in a-state of
                    activity at no very distant period has been shown by the discovery at many
                    places of broken pottery and bronze implements below the strata of tufa or other
                    volcanic deposits. Traces of human life have even been found below that great
                    flood of lava which, issuing from the Alban Hills, flowed towards the site of
                    Rome, only stopping about 3 miles short, by the tomb of Cecilia Metella.</p>               <p>The superficial strata on which Rome is built are of three main kinds: (1) the
                    plains and valleys on the left bank of the Tiber are covered, as it were, by a
                    sea of alluvial deposits, in the midst of which (2) the hills of volcanic origin
                    rise like so many islands; and (3) on the right bank of the Tiber, around the
                    Janiculan and Vatican Hills, are extensive remains of an ancient sea-beach,
                    conspicuous in parts by its fine golden sand and its deposits of greyish white
                    potter’s clay. From its yellow sand the Janiculan has been sometimes known as
                    the Golden Hill, a name which survives in the church on its summit called S.
                    Pietro in Montorio (Monte d’Oro). In addition to these three chief deposits, at
                    a few places, especially in the Aventine and Pincian Hills, under-strata of
                    travertine crop out—a hard limestone rock, once in solution in running water,
                    and deposited gradually as the water lost its carbonic-acid solvent, a process
                    still rapidly going on at Term, Tivoli and other places in the neighbourhood.
                    The conditions under which the tufa hills were formed have been very various, as
                    is clearly seen by an examination of the rock at different places. The volcanic
                    ashes and sand of which the tufa is composed appear in parts to lie just as they
                    were showered down from the crater; in that case it shows but little sign of
                    stratification, and consists wholly of igneous products. In parts time and
                    pressure have hound together these scoriae into a soft and friable rock; in
                    other places they still lie in loose sandy beds and can be dug out with the
                    spade. Other masses of tufa again show signs either of having been deposited in
                    water, or else washed away from their first resting-place and redeposited with
                    visihle stratifications; this is shown by the water-worn pebbles and chips of
                    limestone rock, which form a conglomerate bound together by the volcanic ashes
                    into a sort of natural cement. A third variety is that which exists on the
                    Palatine Kill. Here the shower of red-hot ashes has evidently fallen on a
                    thickly growing forest, and the burning wood, partly smothered hy the ashes, has
                    been converted into charcoal, large masses of which are embedded in the tufa
                    rock. In some places charred branches of trees, their form well preserved, can
                    be easily distinguished. The so-called “ wall of Romulus ” is built of this
                    conglomerate of tufa and charred wood; a very perfect section of the branch of a
                    tree is visible on one of the blocks by the Scalae Caci.</p>               <p>So great have been the physical changes in the site of Rome since the first dawn
                    of the historic period that it is difficult now to realize what its aspect once
                    was. The Forum Romanum, the Velabrum, the great Campus Martius (now the most
                    crowded part of modern Rome), and other valleys were once almost impassable
                    marshes or pools of water (Ov. <hi rend="italic">Fasti,</hi> vi. 401; Dionys.
                    ii. 50). The draining of these valleys was effected by means of the great
                    cloacae, which were among the earliest important architectural works of Rome
                    (Varro, <hi rend="italic">Ling. Lat.</hi> iv. 149). Again, the various hills and
                    ridges were once more numerous and very much more abrupt than they are now. At
                    an early period, when each hill was crowned by a 'Separate village fort, the
                    great object of the inhabitants was to increase the steepness of its cliffs and
                    render access difficult. At a later time, when Rome was united under one
                    government, the very physical peculiarities which had originally made its hills
                    so populous, through their natural adaptability for defence, became extremely
                    inconvenient in a united city, where architectural symmetry and splendour were
                    above all things aimed at. Hence the most gigantic engineering works were
                    undertaken: tops of hills were levelled, whole ridges cut away, and gentle
                    slopes formed in the place of abrupt cliffs. The levelling of the Velia and the
                    excavation of the site for Trajan’s forum are instances of this. The same works
                    were continued in the middle ages, as when in the 14th century an access was
                    made to the Capitoline Arx <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                        n="1"> By the great flight of marble steps up to S. Maria in Ara Coeli.
                    </note> from the side of the Campus Martius; up to that time a steep cliff had
                    prevented all approach except from the side of the Forum.</p>               <p>Finally, after Rome had become the capital of united Italy, in the last quarter
                    of the 19th century, an extensive government plan <hi rend="italic">{piano
                        regulatore)</hi> was gradually carried out, with the object of reducing
                    hills and valley to a uniform level and constructing wide boulevards on the
                    chessboard method of a modem American city. The constant fires which have at
                    times devastated Rome have been a powerful agent in obliterating the natural
                    contour of the ground; and the accumulated rubbish from this and other causes
                    has in some places overlaid the ground to a depth of 40 ft., notably in the
                    valleys.</p>               <p>                   <hi rend="smallcaps">The Ancient City</hi>
               </p>               <p>The chief building materials used in ancient Rome may be enumerated as follows:
                    (1) <hi rend="italic">Tufa,</hi> the “ <hi rend="italic">ruber et niger
                        tophus”</hi> of Vitruvius (ii. 7), varying in colour from warm brown to
                    yellow or greyish green (called <hi rend="italic">capellaccio).</hi> The
                    Aventine, Palatine and Capitoline Hills contained quarries of the tufa, much
                    worked at an early period (see Liv. xxvi. 27, xxxix. 44, and Varro, <hi
                        rend="italic">L.L.</hi> iv. 151). It is a very bad “ weather-stone,” but
                    stands well if protected with stucco (Plin. <hi rend="italic">H.N.</hi> xxxvi.
                    166). (2) <hi rend="italic">Lapis Albanus,</hi> from</p>               <p>Alba Longa, of volcanic origin, a conglomerate of ashes, gravel and fragments of
                    stone; its quarries are still worked at Albano and Marino. This is now called
                        <hi rend="italic">peperino,</hi> from the black scoriae, like peppercorns,
                    with which the brown conglomerate mass is studded. (3) <hi rend="italic">Lapis
                        Gabinus,</hi> from Gabii, very similar to the last, but harder and a better
                    weather-stone; it contains large lumps of broken lava, products of an earlier
                    eruption, and small pieces of limestone. According to Tacitus <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Ann.</hi> xv. 43), it is fire-proof, and this is also the case with the
                    Alban stone. Lapis Gabinus is now called <hi rend="italic">sperone.</hi> (4) <hi
                        rend="italic">Silex</hi> (mod. <hi rend="italic">selce),</hi> a lava from
                    the now extinct volcanoes in the Alban Hills, used for paving roads; when broken
                    into small pieces and mixed with lime and pozzolana it formed an immensely
                    durable concrete. It is dark grey, very hard and breaks with a slightly
                    conchoidal fracture (Plin. <hi rend="italic">H.N.</hi> xxxvi. 135; Vitr. ii. 7),
                    but does not resemble what is now called <hi rend="italic">silex</hi> or flint.
                    (5) <hi rend="italic">Lapis Tiburtinus</hi> (travertine), the chief quarries of
                    which are at Tibur (Tivoli) and other places along the river Anio; a hard pure
                    carbonate of lime, of a creamy white colour, deposited from running or dripping
                    water in a highly</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0585" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0626.jp2"/>
               <p>stratified form, with frequent cavities and fissures lined with crystals. As
                    Vitruvius (ii. 5) says, it is a good weather-stone, but is soon calcined by
                    fire. If laid horizontally it is very strong, but if set on end its crystalline
                    structure is a great source of weakness, and it splits from end to end. Neglect
                    on the part of Roman builders of this important precaution in many cases caused
                    a complete failure in the structure. This was notably the case in the rostra.
                    (6) <hi rend="italic">Pidvis Puteolanus</hi> (pozzolana), so called from
                    extensive beds of it at Puteoli—a volcanic product, which looks like red sandy
                    earth, and lies in enormous beds under and round the city of Rome. When mixed
                    with lime it forms a very strong hydraulic cement, of equal use in concrete,
                    mortar or undercoats of stucco. It is to this material that the concrete walls
                    of Rome owe their enormous strength and durability, in many cases far exceeding
                    those of the most massive stone masonry. Vitruvius devotes a chapter (bk. ii.
                    ch. 6) to this very important material.</p>               <p>Bricks were either sun-dried <hi rend="italic">(lateres crudi)</hi> or
                    kiln-baked <hi rend="italic">(lateres cocti, testae).</hi> The remarks of
                    Vitruvius (ii. 3) seem to refer wholly to sun-dried bricks, of which no examples
                    now exist in Rome. It is important to recognize the fact that among the existing
                    ancient buildings of Rome there is no such thing as a brick wall or a brick arch
                    in the true sense of the word; bricks were merely used as a facing to concrete
                    walls and arches and have no constructional importance. <note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial" n="2"> n less solid constructions than those
                        which have survived until modern times bricks were doubtless used by
                        themselves. </note> Concrete <hi rend="italic">(opus caemen-ticium,</hi>
                    Vitr. ii. 4, 6, 8), the most important of all the materials used, is made of
                    rough pieces of stone, or of fragments of marble, brick, &amp;c., averaging
                    from about the size of a man’s fist and embedded in cement made of lime and
                    pozzolana—forming one solid mass of enormous strength and coherence. Stucco,
                    cement and mortar <hi rend="italic">(tectorium, opus albarium</hi> and other
                    names) are of many kinds; the ancient Romans especially excelled in their
                    manufacture. The cement used for lining the channels of aqueducts <hi
                        rend="italic">(opris signinum)</hi> was made of lime mixed with pounded
                    brick or potsherds and pozzolana; the same mixture was used for floors under the
                    “ nucleus ” or finer cement on which the mosaic or marble paving-slabs were
                    bedded, and was called <hi rend="italic">caementum ex testis tunsis.</hi> For
                    walls, three or four coats of stucco were used, often as much as 5 in. thick
                    altogether; the lower coats were of lime and pozzolana, the finishing coats of
                    powdered white marble <hi rend="italic">(opus albarium)</hi> suitable to receive
                    painting. Even marble buildings, were usually coated with a thin layer of this
                    fine white stucco, nearly as hard and durable as the marble itself—a practice
                    also employed in the finest buildings of the Greeks—probably because it formed a
                    more absorbent* ground for coloured decoration; stone columns coated in this way
                    were called <hi rend="italic">“ columnae dealbatae</hi> ” (Cic. <hi
                        rend="italic">In Verr.</hi> ii. 1, 52 seq.). For the kinds of sand used in
                    mortar and stucco, Vitruvius (ii. 4) mentions sea, pit and river sand, saying
                    that pit sand is to be preferred.</p>               <p>Marble appears to have come into use about the beginning of the 1st century B.c.
                    Its introduction was at first viewed with great jealousy,’ as savouring of Greek
                    luxury. The orator Crassuswas the first to use it in his house on the Palatine,
                    built about 92 B.c.; and, though he had only six small columns of Hymettian
                    marble, he was for this luxury nicknamed the “ Palatine Venus ” by the stern
                    republican M. Brutus (Plin. <hi rend="italic">H.N.</hi> xxxvi. 7). The temporary
                    wooden theatre of the aedile M. Aemilius Scaurus, built in 58 B.c., appears to
                    have been the first building in which marble was more largely used; its 360
                    columns and the lower order of its scena were of Greek marble (see Plin. <hi
                        rend="italic">H.N.</hi> xxxvi. 5, 50). In a very few years, under the rule</p>               <p>of Augustus, marble became very common. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial" n="3"> The oft-quoted boast of Augustus (Suet. <hi
                            rend="italic">Aug.</hi> 29) that he “ found Rome of brick and left it of
                        marble ” has probably much truth in it, if for “ brick ” we read “ peperino
                        and tufa.” In the time of Augustus burnt brick was very little used, the
                        usual wall-facings being <hi rend="italic">opus quadralum</hi> of tufa or
                        peperino, and <hi rend="italic">opus reticu-latum</hi> of tufa only. </note>
               </p>               <p>Of white statuary marble four principal varieties were used. (1) <hi
                        rend="italic">Marmor Lunense,</hi> from Luna, near the modern Carrara
                    (Strabo, v. p. 222), is of many qualities, from the purest creamy white and the
                    finest grain to the coarser sorts disfigured with bluish grey streaks.</p>               <p>(Ex., the eleven Corinthian columns in the Borsa.) (2) <hi rend="italic">Marmor
                        Hymettium,</hi> from Mount Hymettus, near Athens, is coarser in grain than
                    the best Luna marble and is usually marked wi(h grey or blue striations (Strabo
                    ix. p. 399). (Ex., the forty-two columns in the nave of S. Maria Maggiore and
                    the columns ih S. Pietro in Vincoli.). (3) <hi rend="italic">Marmor
                        Pcntcticum,</hi> from Mount Pentelicus, also near Athens, is very fine in
                    grain and of a pure white; it was more used for architectural purposes than for
                    statues, though some sculptors preferred it above all others, especially
                    Pheidias and Praxiteles. (Ex., the bust of the young Augustus in the Vatican.)

                    stones—granites and basalts—were introduced in great quantities. The basalts— “
                    basanites ” of Pliny (xxxvi. 58)—are very refractory, and can only be worked by
                    the help of emery or diamond dust.</p>               <p>The former was obtained largely at Naxos; diamond-dust drills are mentioned by

                    markings; examples of all three exist, but are comparatively rare. The red
                    variety called “ porphyry ” was used in enormous quantities. It is the “
                    porphyntes ” of Pliny <hi rend="italic">(H.N.</hi>

                    small specks of white felspar; hence it was also called “ leptopsephos.” A large
                    number of columns of it exist, and it was much used for pavements of <hi
                        rend="italic">opus Alexandrinum.</hi> A rich green porphyry or basalt was
                    also largely used, but not in such great masses as the red porphyry. It has a
                    brilliant green ground covered with rectangular light green crystals of felspar.
                    This is the <hi rend="italic">lapis Lacedaemontus</hi> (wrongly called by the
                    modern Romans “serpent-ino *’), so named from its quarries in Mount Ta^getus in
                    Lace-daemonia (Paus. iii. 21, 4; Plin. <hi rend="italic">ILN.</hi> xxxvi. 55;
                    Juv. xi. 175). It appears to have been mostly used for pavements and panels of
                    wall linings. The granites used in.Rome came mostly from near Philae on the Nile
                    (Plin. <hi rend="italic">H.N.</hi> xxxvi. 63). The red sort was called <hi
                        rend="italic">lapis pyrrhopoecilus</hi> and the grey <hi rend="italic">lapis
                        psaronius.</hi> The columns in the Basilica Ulpia are a fine example of the
                    latter; both sorts are used for the columns of the Pantheon and those of the
                    temple of Saturn in the Forum. Gigantic ships were specially made to carry the
                    obelisks and other great monoliths (Plin. //.A. xxxvi. 2, 67).</p>               <p>The style of architecture employed in ancient Rome (see Architecture, section
                        <hi rend="italic">Roman,</hi> and Roman Art) may be said to have passed
                    through three stages—the Etruscan, the Greek and the Roman. During the first few
                    centuries of the existence of the city, both the methods of construction and the
                    designs employed appear to have been purely Etruscan. The earliest temples were
                    either simple cellae without columns, or else, in the case of the grander
                    temples, such as that of Capitoline Jupiter, the columns were very widely spaced
                    (araeostyle), and consequently had entablatures of wooden beams. The
                    architectural decorations were more generally in gilt bronze or painted
                    terra-cotta than in stone, and the paintings or statues which decorated the
                    buildings were usually the work of Etruscan artists. <note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial" n="6"> Pliny <hi rend="italic">(H.N.</hi>
                        xxxv. 154), quoting Varro, says that the decorations in painting and
                        sculpture of the temple of Ceres near the Circus Maximus were the work of
                        the first Greek artists employed in Rome, and that before that (c. 493 <hi
                            rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> “all things in temples were Etruscan.”
                        Vitruvius (iii. 3) says, “ Ornantque signis fictilibus aut aereig inauratis
                        eorum fastigia Tuscanico more, uti est ad Circum Maximum Cereris, et
                        Herculis Pompeiani, item Capitolii ” (cf. iv. 7, vi. 3). </note> The Greek
                    influence is more obvious; it is found in the period following the Second Punic
                    or Hannibalic War, and almost all the temples of the earlier imperial age are
                    Greek, with certain modifications, not only in general design but in details and
                    ornaments. Greek architects were largely employed, such as ApoIIodorus of
                    Damascus, who designed Trajan’s forum and other buildings; on the other hand, a
                    Roman, Cossutius, was employed on the building of the Olympieum at Athens, in
                    the 2nd century B.c. Roman architects such as Vitruvius and C. Mucius in the 1st
                    century B.c., Severus and Ccler under Nero, and Rabirius under Domitian, were
                    Greek by education, and probably studied at Athens (see Vitr. vii. <hi

                        is a peculiarity of Roman architecture, but it is not without precedent in
                        Greek buildings of the best period, e.g. in the temple of Zeus at
                        Agrigentum. Surface enrichments over the mouldings were used far more
                        largely by the Romans than by the Greeks. </note> The Romans, however,
                    though far below the Greeks in artistic originality, were very able engineers,
                    and this led to the development of a new and more purely Roman style, in which
                    the restrictions imposed by the use of the stone lintel were put aside and large
                    spaces were covered with vaults and domes cast in semi-fluid concrete, a method
                    which had the enormous advantage of giving the arched form without the constant
                    thrust at the springing which makes true arches or vaults of wide span so
                    difficult to deal with. The enormous vaults of the great thermae, the basilica
                    of Constantine, and the like, cover their spaces with one solid mass like a
                    metal lid, giving the form but not the principle of the arch, and thus allowing
                    the vault to be set on walls which would at once have been thrust apart had they
                    been subjected to the immense leverage which a true arched vault constantly
                    exerts on its imposts. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                        the brick used in vaults and arches is very much exaggerated. </note> This
                    is a very important point, and one which is usually overlooked, mainly owing to
                    the Roman practice of facing their concrete with bricks, which (from an
                    examination</p>               <p>of the surface only) appear to be a principal item in the construction. The
                    walls of the Pantheon, for example, are covered with tiers of brick arches, and
                    many theories have been invented as to their use in distributing the weight of
                    the walls. But a recognition of the fact that these walls are of concrete about
                    20 ft. thick, while the brick facing averages scarcely 6 in. in thickness,
                    clearly shows that these “ relieving arches ” have no more constructional use as
                    far as concerns the pressure than if they were painted on the surface of the
                    walls. The same applies to the superficial use of brick in all arches and
                    vaults. Although, however, the setting of the concrete rendered the brick facing
                    superfluous, it played its part in sustaining the fluid mass on its centring
                    during the process of solidification.</p>               <p>At first tufa only was used in <hi rend="italic">opus quadratum,</hi> as we see

                    Republic appears to have been largely employed for exterior walls or points
                    where there was heavy pressure, while other parts were built of tuia.</p>               <p>Thirdly, travertine appears to have been introduced about the 2nd century n.c..
                    but was used at first for mereiy ornamental purposes, very much as marble was

                    as in the temple of Vespasian and the Colosseum. The tufa or peperino blocks
                    were roughly 2 (Roman) ft. thick in regular courses (the “ isodomum ” of
                    Vitruvius) by 2 ft. across the end, and under the Republic often exactly 4 ft.
                    long, so that two blocks set endways</p>               <p>ranged with one set</p>               <p>lengthways.

                    frequently used for the main walls, peperino (e.g. in the <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    Servian ” wall on the Aventine) or <hi rend="sub">x</hi> travertine (e.g. in^
                    the forum of Augustus and the temple of Fortuna</p>               <p>Virilis, so called) was inserted at points of special pressure, such as piers or
                    arches (see fig.). The Colosseum is a particularly elaborate example of this
                    mixed construction with three degrees of pressure supported by three different
                    materials.</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0587" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0630.jp2"/>
               <p>The use of mortar with <hi rend="italic">opus quadratum</hi> is a sign of a
                    comparatively I early date. It.occurs, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> in the “
                    Servian ” wall on the Aventine</p>               <p>and in the Tabularium. Under the Empire massive blocks, whether of tufa,
                    travertine or marble, are set without any mortar. It must, however, be observed
                    that in these early instances the “ mortar ” is but a thin stratum of lime,
                    little thicker than stout paper, used not as a cement to bind the blocks
                    together, but simply to give the joints a smoothly fitting surface. The actual
                    binding together was done by clamps and dowels, as well as by the mass and
                    weight of the great blocks used. Except in the earliest masonry, each block was
                    very carefully fastened, not only to the next blocks on the same course, which
                    was done with double dove-tai led dowels of wood, but also to those above and
                    below with stout iron clamps, run with lead (Vitr. ii. 8). <note anchored="true"

                    often fitted with great care,though it was generally covered with stucco. The
                    so-called “ house of Livia ” on the Palatine is a good example*of the earlier
                    sort, when the quoins were made of small rectangular blocks of tufa. Under the
                    Empire brick quoins came into use (as may be seen, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi>
                    in the so-called palace of Caligula). Though in Rome <hi rend="italic">opus
                        reticulatum</hi> was almost always made of tufa, in the neighbourhood of the
                    city it was sometimes of peperino or even lava, where these materials w <hi

                    middle of the 1st century B.c. is known. The facing consisted at first of
                    triangular fragments, of tiles <hi rend="italic">(tegulae),</hi> broken for the
                    purpose and more or less irregular in shape and size, but from the latter part
                    of the ist century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> onwards triangular bricks were
                    specially manufactured for w <hi rend="sup">r</hi> all-facings. This shape was
                    adopted in order to present a large surface on the face with little expenditure
                    of brick, and also to improve the bond wrth the concrete behind (see fig. 4).
                    Even party w'alls of small rooms are not built solid, but have a concrete core
                    faced with brick triangles about 3 in. long. In order to support the facing
                    until the concrete was set, the Roman builders used a wooden framing covered
                    with planks on the inside. Sometimes the planks were nailed outside the wooden
                    uprights, as was done with unfaced concrete w'alls, and then a series of grooves
                    appear in the face of the brickwork. Walls faced with <hi rend="italic">opus
                        reticulatum</hi> must have been supported temporarily</p>               <p>in the same way.</p>               <p>The character of the brick facing *is a great help towards determining the date
                    of Roman buildings. In early work the bricks are thick and the joints thin,
                    while in later times the reverse is the case, so that brickwork of the time of
                    Severus and later has more bricks to the foot than that of the Flavian period.</p>               <p>The length of the bricks as it appears on the face is no guide to the date,
                    since one or more of the sharp points of the brick triangles w <hi rend="sup"
                        >r</hi> ere frequently broken off before they were used. Moreover,</p>               <p>varieties both in quality of workmanship and size of the bricks often occur in w
                        <hi rend="sup">r</hi> ork of the same date. In the remains of Nero’s Golden
                    House great varieties appear, and some of the walls in the inferior rooms are
                    faced with very irregular and careless brickwork. <note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial" n="11"> Some of the bricks are as much as 2i
                        in. thick, while i| in. is the usual maximum for Roman bricks. </note>
                    Special care and neatness were employed in the rare cases when the wall was not
                    to be covered with stucco, which in the absence of marble was usually spread
                    over both inside and outside walls. All these circumstances make great caution
                    necessary in judging of dates; fortunately after the ist century <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and in some cases even earlier, stamps impressed
                    on bricks, and especially on the large tiles used for arches, give clearer
                    indications. The reason of the almost universal use of smooth facings either of
                        <hi rend="italic">opus reticulatum</hi> or of brick over concrete walls is a
                    very puzzling question; for concrete itself forms an excellent ground for the
                    stucco coating or backing to the marble slabs, while the stucco adheres with
                    difficulty to a smooth facing, and is very liable to fall away. The modem
                    practice of raking out the joints to form a key was not employed by the Romans,
                    but before the mortar. w <hi rend="sup">r</hi> as hard they studded the face of
                    the wall with marble plugs and iron or bronze nails driven into the joints, so
                    as to give a hold for the stucco—a great waste both of labour and material.

                    in the 3rd century*t began to be inferior in quality; and the pozzolana used
                    under the later Empire is brown instead of red.</p>               <p>Concrete was at first always made of lumps of tufa; then travertine, lava,
                    broken bricks and even marble were used, in fact all the chips and fragments of
                    the mason’s yard. Under the Empire the concrete used was made wnth travertine or
                    lava for foundations, with tufa or broken bricks for walls, and with tufa or
                    pumice-stone (for the sake of lightness) for vaults. Massive walls were cast in
                    a mould; upright timbers, about 6 by 7 in. thick and 10 to 14 ft. long, were set
                    in rows on each face of the</p>               <p>future wall; planks 9 to</p>               <p>10 in. wide were nailed</p>               <p>to them, so as to form a</p>               <p>case, into which the semi</p>               <p>fluid mass of stones,</p>               <p>lime and pozzolana was</p>               <p>poured.

Owing to this method of building the
                    progress of the work from day to day can often be traced by a change in the look
                    of the concrete. About 3 ft. appears to have been the average amount of wall
                    raised in a day.</p>               <p>Marble linings were fixed very firmly to the waifs with long clamps of metal,
                    hooked at the end so as to hold in a hole made in the marble slab. Fig. 4 gives
                    an example, of the time of Augustus, fixed against a stone wall. The blocks were
                    usually marked in the quarry with a number, and often with the names of the
                    reigning emperor and the overseer of the quarry. These quarry-marks are often of
                    great value as indications of the date of a building or statue. <note

               <p>building acts, not unlike those of modern London, were enacted by several of the
                    emperors. These fixed the materials to be used, thickness of walls, minimum
                    width of streets, maximum height allowed for houses, &amp;c. After the great
                    fire in Nero’s reign, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 64, an act was passed
                    requiring the lower storeys of houses to be built with fire-proof materials,
                    such as peperino or burnt brick.</p>               <p>Enormous accumulations of statues and pictures enriched Rome during its period
                    of greatest splendour. In the first place, the numerous statues of the
                    republican and even of the regal period were religiously preserved at a time
                    when, from their archaic character, they must have been regarded rather as
                    objects of sacred or archaeological interest than as works of art (Plin. <hi
                        rend="italic">II.N.</hi> xxxiv. 15 ff., xxxv. 19 ff.). Secondly came the
                    large Graeco-Roman class, mostly copies of earlier Greek works, executed in Rome
                    by Greek artists. 'Io this class belongs most of the finest existing sculpture
                    preserved in the Vatican and other museums. Thirdly, countless statues and
                    pictures were stolen from almost every important city in Greece, Magna Graecia,
                    Sicily and western Asia Minor. These robberies began early, and were carried on
                    for many centuries. The importations included works of art by all the chief
                    artists from the £th century downwards. Long lists are given by Pliny <hi
                        rend="italic">(II.N.</hi> xxxiii.-xxxvi.), and pedestals exist with the
                    names of Praxiteles, Timarchus, Polyclitus, Bryaxis and others. These
                    accumulated works of sculpture* were of all materials—gold and ivory (Suet. <hi

                    stores of Greek paintings much inferior in number; not only were easel pictures
                    by Zeuxis, Apelles, Timanthes and other Greek, artists taken, but even mural
                    paintings were carefully cut off their walls and brought to Rome secured in
                    wooden frames (Plin. <hi rend="italic">H.N.</hi>

                    bare at a lower level. The original pavement of the Nova Via was exposed in

                    Bronze Age have been found on the Aventine and elsewhere; and from the Early
                    Iron Age onwards we have a continuous archaeological record, owing to the
                    discovery of ancient burial-places. In 1902 a very early necropolis was brought
                    to light at the S.E. corner of the temple of Antoninus and Faustina, some 17 ft.
                    below the level of the Forum. The graves contain either the ashes of cremated
                    bodies placed in a large vessel <hi rend="italic">(dolio),</hi> or skeletons
                    buried either in a simple trench <hi rend="italic">(fossa),</hi> a tufa
                    sarcophagus or a tree-trunk. The cremation graves are the earlier, and none are
                    later than the 6th century, while the oldest may be of the 9th; the pottery and
                    other objects placed in the graves belong to the Early Iron Age. It is clear
                    that this cemetery is earlier than the union of the Palatine and Quirinal
                    settlements in one city (see below, p. 759). Other early cemeteries have been
                    discovered on the Quirinal and Esquiline, which were in use from the beginning
                    of the Iron Age down to the beginning of the historic period. The large
                    necropolis on the Esquiline is cut in two by the “ Servian ” wall, which is
                    evidently of later date. The later tombs contain objects of Etruscan, Phoenician
                    and Greek manufacture.</p>               <p>There is no doubt that the earliest settlement bearing the name of Rome was on

                        Theprimacy of the Palatine ” has been disputed by Carter G4raer. <hi
                            rend="italic">Jour. Arch.,</hi> 1908, p. 181), who thinks that the first
                            <hi rend="italic">city</hi> was that of the Four Regions (see below)
                        formed by the Etruscan kings. </note> which was both easy of defence and
                    possessed the means of communication with its neighbours in the proximity of the
                    Tiber. The name <hi rend="italic">Roma</hi> is said to mean “ river,” but this
                    is uncertain. The Palatine is roughly square in outline, and the Roman
                    antiquarians sometimes applied the name Roma Quadrata to the earliest
                    settlement; but the term seems more properly to have applied to a sanctuary
                    connected with the foundation of the city. The ideal boundary of the city was
                    formed by the Pomerium (see Varro, <hi rend="italic">L.L.</hi> v. 143; Liv. i.
                    44; Dionys. i. 88), whose original course is traced by Tacitus <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Ann.</hi> xii. 24). It passed along the foot of the hill <hi rend="italic"
                        >(per ima montis Palatini),</hi> the angle-points being given by the Ara
                    Maxima in the Forum Boarium, the Ara Consi in the Circus Maximus, the Curiae
                    Veteres (near the arch of Constantine) and the Sacellum Larum (at the N. angle).
                    But this was of course not a defensible site, and the extent of the fortified
                    city can only be determined by the traces of its early walls. These enable us to
                    fix its line along the whole valley of the Velabrum, on the west of the hill,
                    and along the valley of the Circus Maximus as far as the so-called Paedagogium,
                    about half-way on the south side.</p>               <p>Considerable remains of this fortification exist near the west angle of the
                    hill. These show that the natural strength given by the cliff was increased by
                    artificial means. The wall was set neither at the top nor at the foot of the
                    hill, but more than half-way up, a level terrace or shelf all round being cut in
                    the rock on which the base of the wall stood. Above that the hill was cut away
                    into a cliff, not quite perpendicular but slightlybattering ” inwards, to give
                    greater stability to the wall, which was built up against it, like a retaining
                    wall, reaching to the top of the cliff, and probably a few feet higher. The
                    stones used in this wall are soft tufa, a warm brown in colour, and full of
                    masses of charred wood. The cutting to form the steep cliff probably supplied
                    part of the material for the wall; and ancient quarries, afterwards used as
                    reservoirs for water, exist in the mass of rock on which the so-called temple of
                    Jupiter Victor stands. It has been asserted that these tufa blocks are not cut
                    but split with wedges; this, however, is not the case. Tufa does not split into
                    rectangular masses, but</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0589" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0632.jp2"/>
               <p>would be shattered to pieces by a wedge; moreover, distinct tool-marks can be
                    seen on all the blocks whose surface is well preserved and in the quarries
                    themselves. Chisels from one-fourth to three-fourths of an inch in width were
                    used, and also a sharp-pointed pick or hammer. The wall is about io ft. thick at
                    the bottom, and increases in thickness above as the scarped cliff against which
                    it is built recedes. It is built of blocks laid in alternate courses of headers
                    and stretchers, varying in thickness from 22 to 24 in., in length from 3 to 5
                    ft. and in width from 19 to 22 in. These blocks are carefully worked on their
                    beds, but the face is left rough, and the vertical joints are in some cases
                    open, spaces of nearly 2 in. being left between block and block; in other cases
                    the vertical joints are worked true and close like the beds. No mortar was used.
                    At two points on the side of the Velabrum winding passages are excavated in the
                    tufa cliff, the entrance to which was once closed by the ancient wall. One of
                    these in early times (before water in abundance was brought to the Palatine on
                    aqueducts) was used as a reservoir to collect surface w’ater, probably for use
                    in case of siege; circular shafts for buckets are cut downwards through the rock
                    from the top of the hill. A similar rock-cut cistern with vertical shafts, of
                    very early date, exists at Alba Longa. Opposite the church of S. Teodoro a
                    series of buttresses belonging to the early wall exists, partly concealed by a
                    long line of buildings of the later years of the Republic and the early Empire,
                    to make room for which the greater part, of the then useless wall was pulled
                    down, and only fragments left here and there, where they could be worked into
                    the walls of the later houses.</p>               <p>The age of the walls here described cannot be determined with certainty, but
                    their resemblance to the remains of the “ Servian ” wall, especially in the
                    system of “ headers and stretchers ” and the dimensions of the blocks, makes it
                    certain that they do not differ greatly in date from that w’urk. The chief
                    technical difference lies in the open vertical joints found in some cases; but
                    too much stress should not be laid on this feature. There arc, however at the
                    western angle of the hill some remains of an earlier fortification, constructed
                    with blocks of grey-green tufa, smaller in size than those of the main wall. A
                    few courses have been preserved, owing to the fact that at the angle of the hill
                    this wall was encased first of all by that described above and afterwards by
                    concrete substructures of imperial date. The technique is primitive, as the
                    blocks are of irregular size and are not laid in courses of “ headers and
                    stretchers ”; the nearest parallel is supplied by the foundations of the temple
                    of Jupiter Capitolinus. These remains are shown by Delbrück, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Der Apollotempel auf dem Marsfelde,</hi> pl. iii., cf. p. 13 1.</p>               <p>Pliny <hi rend="italic">(II. N.</hi> iii. 66) tells us that the city of Romulus
                    had three gates (cf. Serv.Xd. <hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> i. 222); and three
                    approaches to the Palatine city can be traced. One is the so-called Scalae Caci,
                    a long sloping ascent cut through the rock (see fig. 17) from the side of the
                    Circus Maximus; some remains of the early wall still exist along the sides of
                    this steep ascent or staircase. The upper part of this has remains of a basalt
                    pavement, added in later times, probably covering the more ancient rock-cut
                    steps. The name of the gate which led at this point into the Palatine city is
                    unknown. The only two gates whose name and position can be (with any degree of
                    probability) identified are the Porta Romanula and the Porta Mugonia. The former
                    of these is called Porta Romana by Festus (ed. Mülfer, p. 262), who states that
                    it was at the foot of the Clivus Victoriae (see fig. 17) and was so called by
                    the Sabines of the Capitol because it was their natural entrance to Roma
                    Quadrata (see also Varro, <hi rend="italic">L.L.</hi> v. 164 (who only mentions
                    the tw’o gates named above), vi. 24). It would thus have been at the foot of the
                    hill in the Velabrum (see below, p. 600); but Varro says that it was approached
                    by steps from the Nova Via, <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial" n="17"> Novalia,” MSS.’ “ Navalia ’’has been conjectured.
                    </note> which would place it at the N. angle of the Palatine. The stairs
                    connecting the Nova Via with the Clivus Victoriae still exist. Doubtful traces
                    of the Porta Mugonia (see Sol. i. 24) have been discovered where a basalt paved
                    road leads up into the Palatine from the Summa Sacra Via and the Summa Nova Via,
                    which join near the arch of Titus; exposure to weather has now destroyed the
                    soft tufa blocks of which this gate was built. This is probably the “ vet us
                    porta Palatii ” of Livy (i. 12), through which the Romans fled when</p>               <p>defeated by the Sabines.</p>               <p>The Palatine settlement was the nucleus around which, by a series of expansions,
                    the historical city of Rome grew up. The first step was the amalgamation of Roma
                    Quadrat a with the villages on the neighbouring spurs of the Esquiline and
                    Caelian. This gave birth to the community of the Seven Hills, whose existence is
                    proved by the survival of the festival known as the Septimontium, celebrated
                    on.the nth of December (Fest. 340; Macrob. i. 16, 6). The seven hills were not
                    those familiar in later nomenclature, but the following:—(1) Palatium and (2)
                    Cermalus, the two summits of the Palatine; (3) Velia, the saddle between the
                    Palatine and Esquiline; (4). Oppius and (5) Cispius, the two westernmost spurs
                    of the Esquiline, together with (6) Fagutal, the extreme crest of the Oppius;
                    (7) Sucusa (confused by later writers with Subura), the eastern spur of the
                    Caelian. Varro <hi rend="italic">(L.L.</hi> v. 48) mentions the <hi
                        rend="italic">murus terreus Carinarum,</hi> which may have belonged</p>               <p>to the defences of this community, since the N.W. slope of the Oppius bore the
                    name Carinae; but there is no proof that the Septimontium was a walled city.</p>               <p>The next stage in the development of Rome was marked by the division of the city
                    into four regions, ascribed by tradition to Servius Tullius, <note

                            rend="italic">L.L.</hi> v. 46-54. </note> who was said to have formed
                    the four city tribes, corresponding with the regions: (1) Suburana, including
                    the Caelian and the valley between that hill and the Esquiline; (2) Esquilina,
                    the Oppius and Cispius; (3) Collina, the Quirinal and Viminal; (4) Palatina,
                    including the Palatine and Velia. The third region was an addition to the City
                    of the Seven Hills; the new city was, in fact, formed by the union of the old
                    Latin settlement with a Sabine community on the Quirinal. The Capitol was the
                    citadel, but was not included in the city (hence the phrase <hi rend="italic"
                        >urbs et</hi> Capitolium).</p>               <p>Tradition likewise assigned to Servius Tullius <note anchored="true"

                    hill the wall passed to the Quirinal along a spur of elevated ground, afterwards
                    completely cut away by Trajan. Close to the Capitol was the Porta Fontinalis,
                    whence issued the Via Lata. Remains of the w'all and foundations of the gate
                    exist in Via di Marforio. After passing Trajan’s forum, we find remains of the
                    walls ©n the slope of the Quirinal. A piece of the wall has been exposed in the
                    new Via Nazionale, and also an archway under the Palazzo Antonelli, which may
                    represent the Porta Sanqualis (see Festus, ed. Müller, p. 343). The Porta
                    Salutaris (Festus, pp. 326-327) was also on the Quirinal, probably on the slope
                    between the Trevi fountain and the royal palace. Its position is indicated by
                    the existence of some tombs which give the line of the road. On the north-w’est
                    of the Quirinal was the Porta Quirinalis (Festus, p. 254), probably near the “
                    Quattro Fontane.” In the Barberini palace gardens, and especially in those of
                    the Villa Barberini (Horti Sallustiani), extensive remains of the wall have been
                    recently exposed and destroyed,— which was also the fate of that fine piece of
                    wall that passed under the new office of finance, with the Porta Collina, which
                    was not on the line of the present road, but about 50 yds. to the south (see
                    Dionys, ix. 68; Strabo iv. p. 234). Thus far in its course from the Capitol the
                    wall skirted the slopes of hills, which were once much more abrupt than, they
                    are now; but from the Porta Collina to the Porta Esquilina it crossed a large
                    tract of level ground; and here its place was taken by the great <hi
                        rend="italic">agger</hi> described below. About the middle of it the Porta
                    Viminalis was found in 1872; it stood, as Strabo (iv. p. 234) says, <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">utt6</hi> pecrep r&lt;p xebpan, and from it led a road
                    which passed through the Porta Chiusa (ancient name unknown) in Aurelian’s walk
                    Foundations of the Porta Esquilina were found in 1875 close behind the arch of
                    Gallienus. . The further course of the wall across the valley of the Colosseum
                    is the least known part of the circuit. Hence the wall skirts the slopes of the
                    Caelian (where, as is probable, it was pierced by the Porta Caelemontana and
                    Porta Querquetulana) to the valley along which the Via Appia passed through the
                    Porta Capena, near the church of S. Gregorio. Its line along the Aventine is
                    fairly distinct, and near S. Balbina and in the Vigna Torlonia are two of the
                    best-preserved pieces (see below). There were three, gates on the Aventine,—the
                    Porta Naevia.on the southern height, P. Raudusculana in the central depression,
                    and P. Lavernalis on the northern summit. Under the Aventine it appears to have
                    touched the river near the existing foundations supposed to be those of the Pons
                    Sublicius. The Porta Trigemina was close by the bank. He.nce to our
                    starting-point the river formed, the defence of the city, with its massive quay
                    wall.</p>               <p>The wall is built of blocks of tufa, usually the softer kinds, but varying
                    according to its position, as in most cases the stone used was that quarried on
                    the spot. In restorations a. good deal of peperino is used. The blocks average
                    from’23 to 24 in. in thickness—roughly 2 Roman feet—and are laid in alternate
                    courses of headers and stretchers. The method of construction varied according
                    to the nature of the ground</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0590" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0633.jp2"/>
               <p>traversed by the fortification. Where the wall followed the face of the cliffs,
                    as for instance on the Capitol and Quirinal, it was raised on an artificial
                    shelf after the fashion employed on the Palatine <hi rend="italic">(vide
                        supra).</hi> In other places, where the slope was gentler, the wall was
                    formed of rubble with revetments of opus quadratum, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi>
                    on the Aventine; finally, where the ground was flat, as on the plateau of the
                    Esquiline, a ditch was dug and an embankment formed by the upcast; this <hi
                        rend="italic">agger,</hi> as it was called, was then faced with retaining
                    walls of opus quadratum. The length of the agger on the Esquiline is put by
                    Dionysius (ix. 68) at 7 stadia, which agrees, roughly speaking, with the
                    discoveries made in 1876-1879, when the railway station was built and the new
                    quarters laid out. The total length was about 4225 ft., the thickness of wall
                    and agger about 50 it., while the ditch was 100 Roman ft. in width and 30 in
                    depth. There is, however, a difference in technique between the inner and outer
                    retaining walls of the agger. The inner wall is built of greenish tufa in blocks
                    of irregular size, while in the outer brown tufa is employed and the blocks are
                    of standard size, two headers ranging with each stretcher. Between the railway
                    station and the Dogana a fine lofty piece of the front wall remains, with traces
                    of the Porta Viminalis ai^d of the lower back wall. Unfortunately the whole of
                    the bank or agger proper has been removed, and the rough back of the great
                    retaining wall exposed. Both tufa and peperino are used, the latter in restored
                    parts; the blocks vary in length, but average in depth the usual 2 Roman ft. The
                    railway cutting, which has destroyed a great part of the agger, showed clearly
                    the section of the whole work: the strata of different kinds of soil which
                    appeared on the sides of the foss appeared again in the agger, but reversed as
                    they naturally would be in the process of digging out and heaping up. Dionysius
                    (ix. 68) states the length of the agger to have been 7 stadia—that is, about
                    1400 yds.—which agrees (roughly speaking) with the actual discoveries.
                    Originally one road ran along the bottom of the foss and another along its edge;
                    the latter existed in imperial times. But the whole foss appears to have been
                    filled up, probably in the time of Augustus, and afterwards built upon; houses
                    of mixed brick and opus reticulatum still exist against the outside of the great
                    wall, which was itself used as the back wall of these houses, so that we now see
                    painted stucco of the time of Hadrian covering parts of the wall of the kings.
                    Another row of houses seems to have faced the road mentioned above as running
                    along the upper edge cf the foss, thus forming a long street. As early as the
                    time of Augustus a very large part of the wall of the kings had been pulled down
                    and built over, so that even then its circuit was difficult to trace (Dionys.
                    iv. 13). A very curious series of masons’ marks exists on stones of the agger
                    wall (as well as on those of some other early buildings). They are deeply
                    incised, usually on the ends of the blocks, and average from 10 to 14 in. in
                    length: some are single letters or monograms; others are numbers, <hi

                    Paolo. Here the wall has a backi ng of concrete and the upper portion is built
                    with blocks of peperino, set in mortar and bevelled at the edges. These are
                    unmistakable signs that the wall has undergone restoration. This portion is
                    pierced by an arch about'9^ ft. high, which probably served as an embrasure for
                    a military engine. Finally, where the wall skirts the bank of the Tiber it is
                    built in two sections—a foundation about 2 metres in height and 3 in width,
                    which forms a landing-sta^e, and an upper wall, 6 metres high, which retains the
                    bank. It is built of peperino, and is probably later than the</p>               <p>rest of the fortification.</p>               <p>The age of this wall is uncertain, but it has been rendered exceedingly

                    evidence for this is derived from the comparison of other fortifications in
                    central Italy, from the measurements of the blocks employed, which presuppose
                    the later Roman foot of 296 millimetres, and from the character of the alphabet
                    from which the masons’ marks are taken. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    still visible in the great quay wall near the Cloaca Maxima, and a whole network
                    of sewers exists under a great paît of the Servian city. Some of these are not
                    built with arched vaults, but have triangular tops formed of courses of stone on

                    which lined the Tiber at the mouth of the Cloaca Maxima is also of early date.
                    In later times this massive wall was extended, as the city grew, all along the
                    bank of the Campus Martius, and, having lost its importance as a line of
                    defence, had frequent flights of stairs built against it, descending to the
                    river. Some of these are shown in one of the fragments of the marble plan (see
                    Jordan, <hi rend="italic">F.U.R. Frag.</hi> 169). In 1879 a travertine block was
                    dredged up inscribed P. BARRONIVS . BARBA . AED . CVR . GRADOS . REFECIT, dating
                    from the 1st century B.C. This records the repair of one of these river stairs.

                    a punishment was unknown to Roman law, and hence the Career, where criminals
                    were detained pending trial, was of small dimensions. Its remains are preserved
                    beneath the church of S Giuseppe dei Falegnami, and below them is the Tullianum,
                    a dungeon where executions took place. It is partly cut in the tufa rock of the
                    Capitoline hill and partly built of 2-ft. blocks of tufa, set with thin beds of
                    pure lime mortar, in courses projecting one over the othèr. Its name is derived,
                    not from Servius Tullius, asVarro (v. 151) asserts, but from an early Latin
                    word, <hi rend="italic">tullus,</hi> a spring of water; its original use was
                    probably that of a cistern orwell. It was closed by a conical vault, arched in
                    shape, but not constructionally an arch—very like the so-called “ treasury of
                    Atreus ” at Mycenae, and many early Etruscan tombs. When the upper room with its
                    arched vault, also of tufa, was built the upper part of the cone seems to have
                    been removed, and a flat stone floor (a flat arch in construction) substituted.

               </p>               <p>The Forum Romanum or Magnum, as it was called in late times to distinguish it
                    from the imperial fora, occupies a valley which extends from the foot of the
                    Capitoline hill to the north-west part of the Palatine. Till the construction of
                    the great cloacae it was, at least in wet seasons, marshy ground, in which were
                    several pools of water. In early times it was bounded on two sides by rows of
                    shops and houses, dating from the time of the first Tarquín (Liv. i. 35). The
                    shops on the south-west side facing the Sacra Via, where the Basilica Julia
                    afterwards was built, were occupied by the Tabernae Vetcres. <note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="30"> See Livy (xliv. 16),
                        who mentions a house of P. Africanus, “ pone veteres ad Vortumni signum,”
                        which was bought by T. Sempronius to clear the site for the Basilica
                        Sempronia in 169 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> This basilica was afterwards
                        absorbed in the Basilica Julia. </note> The shops on the northern side,
                    being occupied by silversmiths, were called Tabernae Argent ariae, and in later
                    times, when rebuilt after a fire, were called Tabernae Novae (sec Liv. xxvi. 27,
                    xl. 51) <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="31"> Hence
                        these two sides of the Forum are frequently referred to in classical
                        writings as ” sub veteribus ” and ” sub novis.” </note> An altar to Saturn
                    (Dionys. i. 34, vi. 1), traditionally set up by the companions of Hercules, and
                    an altar to Vulcan, both at the end towards the Capitol, with the temple of
                    Vesta and the Regia at the opposite end, were among the earliest monuments
                    grouped around the Forum. The Lacus Curtius vanished, as Varro says (£.£. v.
                    148-49), probably with other stagnant pools, when the cloacae were constructed
                    (Liv. i. 38, 56). <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="32">
                        In later times it was an enclosed space containing an altar; it is described
                        by Ovid <hi rend="italic">{Fast.</hi> vi. 403); according to one tradition
                        it marked the spot where Curtius’s self-immolation filled up the chasm which
                        had opened in the Forum (see Dionys. ii. 41). (See below.) </note> Another
                    pool, the Lacus Servilius, near the Basilica Julia, was preserved in some form
                    or other till the imperial period. Under Sulla it was used as a place to expose
                    the heads of many senators murdered in bis proscriptions (Cic. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Rose. Am.</hi> 32, 89; Seneca, <hi rend="italic">De Prov.</hi> 3, 7). The
                    Volcanal was an open area, so called from the early altar to Vulcan, and was
                    (like the Comitium) a place of public meeting, at least during the regal period.

                    Comitium, and was a space levelled en the lower slope of the Capitoline hill
                    behind the arch of Severus; the foundations of the altar were discovered in
                    1898. It was probably much encroached upon when the temple of Concord was
                    enlarged in the reign of Augustus. Fig. 8 gives a carefully measured plan of the

                    and built at one time from one design, the architectural form of the Forum
                    Romanum was a slow growth. The marshy battlefield of the early inhabitants of
                    the Capitol and Palatine became, when the ground was drained by the great
                    cloacae, under a united rule the most convenient site for political meetings,
                    for commercial transactions, and for the pageants of rich men’s funerals, <hi

                    ever-accumulating crowd of statues and other honorary monuments. On three sides
                    the limits of this open space are marked by paved roads, faced by the stately
                    buildings which gradually took the place of the simple wooden tabernae and

                    50). It was again rebuilt by Julius Caesar, and dedicated by Augustus (29 B.c.)
                    under the name of the Curia Julia, as recorded in the inscription of Ancyra
                    (ç.v.)—CVRIAM. ET. CONTINENS . El. CHALCIDICVM ... FECl. Little is known about
                    the adjoining buildings called the Athenaeum and Chalcidicum; Dion Cassius (li.
                    22) mentions the group. In the reign of Domitian the Curia Julia was restored
                    (Prosp. Aquit. p. 571), and it was finally rebuilt by Diocletian. The existing
                    church of S. Adriano is the Curia of Diocletian, though of course much altered,
                    and with its floor raised about 20 ft. above the old level. The level of the
                    entrance was raised in the middle ages, and again in 1654. Sixteenth-century
                    drawings and engravings show the lower level. The ancient bronze doors now at
                    the end of the nave of the Latcran basilica originally belonged to this
                    building, and were removed thence by Alexander VI1. The brick cornice and marble
                    consoles, covered with enriched mouldings in stucco, and the sham marble facing,
                    also of stucco, if compared with similar details in the baths of Diocletian,
                    leave no doubt as to this being a work of his time, and not, as was at one time

                    beaks of the ships captured from the Latins at the naval victory of Antium and
                    hence called the rostra. Caesar determined to remove the rostra from the
                    Comitium to the Forum, and this plan was carried out after his murder. From the
                    original rostra Cicero delivered his <hi rend="italic">Second</hi> and <hi

                    also adorned with beaks of ships, to commemorate the same victory at Antium.
                    This was the Columna Maeniana, so called in honour of Maenius (Plin. 77. <hi

                    rectangular and at a later time curved. Opposite to the Curia is a square paved
                    with black marble slabs, which it is natural to identify with the <hi

                    a group of early monuments, which were at some time destroyed and afterwards
                    covered over. . We are told on the authority of Varro that Romulus was buried in
                    front of (or behind) the rostra, and that two lions were sculptured as guardians
                    of his tomb; and we find in fact a foundation (D, fig. 9) from which project two
                    moulded bases of tufa (A, B) on which the lions may well have stood, on either
                    side of a block (C) which might serve as an altar. Beside this tomb (if such it

                    another basilica, called Aemilía et Fulvia (Varro vi. 4), was built in 179 <hi

                    within the few subsequent years by members of the same family. Its later name
                    was the Basilica Pauli, and it was remarkable for its magnificent columns of
                    Phrygian marble (Plin. <hi rend="italic">H.N.</hi> xxxvi. 102) or pavonazzetto.
                    Part of the western end was still standing in the 16th century, and was drawn by
                    Giuliano da Sangallo (Iluelsen, <hi rend="italic">The Roman Forum,</hi> fig.
                    61). Recent excavations have shown that it was approached from the Forum by a
                    flight of steps leading to a two-storeyed colonnade. Behind this was a row of
                    tabernae in the middle of which was the entrance to the main hall, consisting in

                    oblong platform about 78 ft. long and 11 ft. high above the level of the Forum;
                    its ground floor, paved with herring-bone bricks, is 2 ft. 6 in. below the Forum
                    paving. Its end and side walls are of tufa blocks, 2 ft. thick and</p>               <p>ft. wide, each carefully clamped to the next with wooden dovetail dowels. Its
                    floor was supported by a series of travertine piers, carrying travertine
                    lintels, on which the floor slabs rested. Outside it was completely lined with
                    Greek marble and had a richly moulded plinth and cornice; the front wall was
                    restored in 1904, and the fragments of the cornice replaced. A groove cut in the
                    top of the cornice shows the place where marble cancelli wete fixed; one of the
                    cornice blocks is partly without this groove, showing that the screen did not
                    extend along the whole front of the rostra. This agrees with a relief on the
                    arch of Constantine, representing the emperor making an oration from the rostra,
                    with other buildings at this end of the Forum shown behind. In this relief the
                    screen is shown with a break in the middle, so that the orator, standing in the
                    centre, was visible from head to foot. Two tiers of large holes to hold the
                    bronze rostra are drilled right through the tufa wall, and even through the
                    travertine pilasters where one happens to come in the way; these holes show that
                    there were nineteen rostra in the lower tier, and twenty above set over the
                    intermediate spaces of the lower row. The back wall of the rostra is of concrete
                    faced with brick. The inside space, under the main floor of the rostra, is
                    coated thickly with stucco—the brick wall being studded in the usual way with
                    iron nails to form a key for the plaster.</p>               <p>immediately behind the rostra is a curved platform approached by steps from the
                    side facing the Capitol. It has been much disputed whether this platform is
                    earlier or later than the rostra; but the evidence of the construction at the
                    point of juncture seems to show that the hemicycle is the earlier. When the arch
                    of Severus was built, part of the platform of the rostra was cut away and a
                    court of irregular shape was thus formed, from which the rostra was approached
                    by steps. The front wall of the hemicycle was now exposed in its eastern half;
                    this was faced with slabs of porta santa marble, pilasters of africano, and a
                    moulded plinth of white marble, whose blocks bear the Greek characters T, A, E,
                    Z, H, 0, K; the omissions make it clear that the blocks were removed from, some
                    other building. A number of holes in the marble, some of which contain fragments
                    of metal pins, show that bronze ornaments were at one time attached to the
                    facing. The hemicycle has been identified (without sufficient reason) with the
                    Graecostasis, a platform near the rostra reserved for foreign embassies (Varro,
                        <hi rend="italic">L.L.</hi> v. 155; Cic. <hi rend="italic">Q.F.</hi> ii. 1),
                    which continued to exist throughout the imperial period and was restored by
                    Antoninus Pius <hi rend="italic">(Vita</hi> 9, 2). It is, however, far more
                    likely that it represents the original form of the rostra as removed to the
                    Forum according to Caesar’s design. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    it was approached from the back by the hemicycle. Tne bronze rostra on the
                    imperial structure were believed to be the original beaks from Antium, moved
                    from the old rostra (Floras, i. 11). On its marble platform stood many statues,
                        <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="44"> The original
                        rostra had specially honorary statues to those Roman ambassadors who had
                        Deen killed while on foreign service (Liv. iv. 17); these were probably
                        removed during Cicero s, lifetime (Cic. <hi rend="italic">Phil.</hi> ix. 2,
                        4; see also Dio Cass, xliii. 49, and Plin., <hi rend="italic">H.N.</hi>
                        xxxiv. 23, 24). Ghastly ornaments fixed to these rostra in the year 43 <hi
                            rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> shortly after they were built, were the head
                        and hands of the murdered Cicero (Appian, <hi rend="italic">Bell. Civ.</hi>
                        iv. 20; Dio Cass, xlvii. 8; Juv. x. 120), as on the original rostra had been
                        fixed many heads of the chief victims of the proscriptions of Marius and
                        Sulla (see Appian, <hi rend="italic">Bell. Civ.</hi> i. 71, 94; Floras iii.
                        21). The denarius of the <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> Lollia with the legend
                        PALIKANVS represents the rostra of the late republican period. </note>

                    (Dio Cass. xlii. 18 and xliv. 4); these are represented on a bas-relief from the
                    arch of Constantine. It is further commonly believed that the marble <hi
                        rend="italic">plutei</hi> which now stand in the centre of the Forum once
                    decorated the rostra. Owing probably to the weight of, the many statues proving
                    too much for the travertine piers, which are not set on their natural beds but
                    endways, and therefore are vep^ weak, the structure seems to have given way at
                    more than one time, and the floor has been supported by piers and arches of
                    brick-faced concrete,</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0594" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0637.jp2"/>
               <p>inserted either in place of or at the sides of the shattered piers. These later
                    additions, apparently of the 3rd and 4th centuries, are omitted in fig. 8 for
                    the sake of clearness. In or about <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 470 the façade
                    of the rostra was prolonged northwards by an addition in very poor brickwork,
                    apparently to celebrate a naval victory over the Vandals.</p>               <p>At the northern end of the curved platform there is a cylindrical structure of
                    concrete faced with brick and lined with thin marble slabs; it is in three
                    stages, each diminishing in size, and appears to be an addition of about the
                    time of Severus. This is usually identified with the Umbilicus Romae, or central
                    point of the city, mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Notitia</hi> and the
                    Einsicdeln MS.(Jordan, <hi rend="italic">Topographicder Stadt Rom,</hi> ii.6^5).</p>               <p>Near the rostra, below the temple of Saturn, stood the Milliarium Aureum, a
                    marble column sheathed in gilt bronze and inscribed with the names and distances
                    of the chief towns on the roads which radiated from the thirty-seven gates of
                    Rome (Plin.. <hi rend="italic">II, N.</hi> ni. 66). It was set up by Augustus in
                    20 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and its position “ sub aede Saturni ” is
                    indicated by Tacitus <hi rend="italic">(Hist,</hi> i. 27; see schol. on Suet.

                    being near the Vicus Jugarius. Its precise position cannot be determined.
                    Fragments of a marble cylinder and cornice with floriated reliefs, now lying in
                    front of the temple of Saturn, probably belonged to this monument; they were
                    found in 1835 near the supposed site.</p>               <p>The position of the temple of Saturn is indicated in Àfon. <hi rend="italic"

                        B.C.; but Dionysius (vi. 1) and Livy (ii. 21) attribute
                    it to the consuls A. Sempronius and M. Minucius in 497 <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    blocks, and part of the lower course of Athenian marble, with which the whole
                    was faced. In the 16th century a piece of the marble frieze was found, inscribed

                    <hi rend="italic">. (C.I.L.</hi> vi. 1316). The erection of the six granite
                    columns in the front and two at the sides, with their clumsily patched
                    entablature, bearing the inscription SENATVS . P0PVLV3QVE .
                        ROMANVS . INCENDIO. CONSVMTVM . RESTITVIT, belongs to the last
                    rebuilding in the time of Diocletian. Some of these fine columns are evidently
                    earlier than this rebuilding, but were refixed with rude caps and bases. One of
                    the columns is set wrong way up, and the whole work is of the most careless
                    sort. Part of the inscription, once inlaid with bronze, recording this latest
                    rebuilding, still exists on the entablature. On the Forum side the temple is
                    flanked by the Vicus Jugarius, while the steep Clivus Capitolinus winds round
                    the front of the great flight of steps leading up to the cella, and then turns along the north-west side of the temple. <note

                    Diocletian rebuilt it mostly with brick or travertine piers, portions of which

                    A final restoration is recorded in inscriptions discovered at various times from

                    .workmanship, in Pentelic marble, belong to a still later restoration under
                    Trajan or Hadrian. One point shows Roman timidity in the use of a lintel: the
                    frieze is jointed so as to form a flat arch, quite needlessly, with the object
                    of relieving the weight on the architrave. Its plan, hexastyle, with only eleven
                    columns on the sides, is shown in fig. 8. It had a lofty podium, faced with
                    marble and decorated with a heavy cornice and pilasters, one under each column.
                    The podium is an interesting example of the enormous solidity of Roman buildings
                    of the best period. Solid tufa walls, 8 ft. thick, are built under the whole of
                    the cella and the front row of columns, while the columns of the sides rest on
                    spurs of similar walling, projecting at right angles from that under the cella;
                    the part immediately under-the columns is of travertine, and the spurs are
                    united and strengthened laterally by massive flat arches, also of travertine.
                    Between the foundations of the columns were chambers used as offices,
                    &amp;c. With the exception of a small chamber under the steps, entered from
                    the Vicus Tuscus, the entire podium is filled up by a solid mass of concrete,
                    made of broken tufa, pozzolana and lime, the whole forming a lofty platform,
                    about 22 ft. high, solid as a rock, on which the columns and upper structure are
                    erected. The podium contains</p>               <p>the Basilica Julia is shown on fragments of the marble plan (sec Plate VIII.). *

                    tufa. Two fragments of mosaic, with simple lozenge pattern in white marble and
                    basalt, still exist in the cella of this temple. The level of the mosaic, which
                    probably belongs to the rebuilding of Tiberius, lies considerably, below that of
                    the later floor, which seems to date from Hadrian’s reign. It has all the
                    characteristics of early mosaic—very small tesserae fitted with great accuracy,
                    like the early mosaic in the Regia. The temple of Castor was often used as a
                    meeting-place for the senate, and its lofty podium formed a tribunal for
                    orations. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="57"> The
                        front of the podium was decorated with ships’ beaks. One of the mad acts of
                        Caligula was to make the temple of Castor into the vestibule of his palace
                        by breaking a door through the back of the cella (Suet. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Cal.</hi> 22). </note> The Fons or Lacus Jutumae (see Ov. <hi

                    were fabled to have watered, their horses, was beside their temple; the precinct
                    was discovered in 1900-1. The Lacus itself, a basin i6j ft. square and 61 ft.
                    deep, is immediately opposite the three standing columns of the temple; in the
                    centre is a base of <hi rend="italic">opus reticulatum,</hi> which supported
                    statues of the Dioscuri; an altar with reliefs, together with other sculptures,
                    has been found close by, and a few yards off is a small cnapel or <hi

                    Augustus, set up in 20 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to commemorate the
                    recovery of tne standards taken from Crassus by the Parthians. Its foundations
                    were discovered in 1888; it had three bays, and rested on the pavement of a
                    street which before</p>               <p>the time of Augustus formed the E. boundary of the Forum.</p>               <p>On the other side of the Sacra Via stand the remains of the temple of Divus
                    Julius, erected by Augustus. Though, little beyond its concrete core is left,
                    its plan can be fairly well made out from the voids in the concrete, which show'
                    the position of the tufa foundations under the walls and columns (as in the
                    temple of Castor). The temple itself, a hexastyle prostyle building, with close
                    intercolumniation (Vitr. iii. 2), stood on a lofty podium with a curved recess
                    in the front between two flights of stairs (see Plate VIII.). The wall which now
                    fills up the recess is a late addition. In 1898 the base of a large altar was
                    discovered in the niche, doubtless that mentioned by Appian <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Bell. Civ.</hi> ii. 148). The podium, which projects in front of the
                    temple itself, was adorned with beaks from the ships taken at Actium (Dio Cass.
                    li. 19), and hence it was called the Rostra Julia, to distinguish it from the
                    other rostra described above. Both were used for the funeral orations in honour
                    of Augustus (Suet. <hi rend="italic">Aug.</hi> 100; see also Dio Cass. liv. 35).
                    Besides the concrete core and the curved tufa wall ol the recess, little now
                    exists except a small bit of the mosaic of the cella floor and some fragments of

                    Recent excavations have brought to light the tufa foundations of the republican
                    building, including a round substructure, which may have supported the <hi

                    an underground cistern, which has been brought into connexion with the shrine of
                    Ops Consiva (Varro, <hi rend="italic">L.L.</hi> vi. 21). The official residence
                    of the <hi rend="italic">pontifex maximus</hi> was not the Regia, but the <hi

                    conveyed a part of his residence on the Palatine to the state in order to
                    satisfy the claims of tradition, and presented the <hi rend="italic">domus

                    and showed that it was a large house extending close up to the Atrium Vestae;
                    its orientation corresponded with that of the Regia. The existing remains are of
                    several dates—first, walls of soft tufa, part possibly of the earliest building;
                    second, walls of hard tufa, of rather later date; and lastly, concrete walls
                    faced with brick, decorated with painted stucco, and columns of travertine, also
                    stuccoed and painted <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    remains were preserved in spite of the erection of later buildings over them,
                    because the levels of the later floors were higher than those of the Regia, and
                    thus covered and protected the mosaics and lower parts of the walls and columns.</p>               <p>The Atrium Vestae, or house of the vestals, like the temple, was many times
                    burnt and rebuilt; the existing building, which was excavated in 1883-84 and
                    more completely in 1991, seems to have been built after the great fire of <hi

                    times—by the Flavian emperors, who added the colonnade; Hadrian, who built the

                    It consists of a. large atrium or quadrangle with columns
                    of cipollino. At one end is the tablinum, with three small rooms on each side of
                    it—probably for the six vestals. A bathroom, bakehouse, servants* offices, and
                    some rooms lined with rich marbles extend along the south-west side.. This
                    extensive building is set against the side of the Palatine, which is cut away to
                    admit the lower storey. Thus the level of the.first upper floor is nearly the
                    same as that of the Nova Via, on which it faces, about 23 ft. above the ground
                    floor. The upper floor is in part well preserved; it contains a large suite of
                    bath and other rooms, which were probably the sleeping apartments of the
                    vestals. All the better rooms and the baths are lined with polished marbles,
                    many of great beauty and rarity; the floors are mostly mosaic of tessellated
                    work. The paving of the tablinum was a beautiful specimen of inlay in porphyry
                    and marble. In many places alterations and clumsy patchings of the 4th and 5th
                    centuries are apparent. A number of statues of the chief vestal, or <hi
                        rend="italic">virgo vestahs maxima,,</hi> with inscribed pedestals, were
                    found in the atrium, mostly of the 3rd century, though a few arc earlier; these
                    are of especial interest as illustrating the sacerdotal dress of the vestals.

                    Nothing but the Nova Via separates the Atrium Vestae from the imperial palace
                    (see Plin. <hi rend="italic">Ep.</hi> vii. 19; Aul. Gell. i. 12), which extends
                    over the site of the Lucus.Vestae—“qui a Palatii radice in Novam Viam devexus

                    in the middle of the atrium looks very much like a border for flower-beds; and
                    it is possible that this miniature garden was made by the vestals when the Lucus
                    Vestae ceased to exist. By the main entrance from the Forum stood a small

                    unusual in plan, having a large cella much wider than its depth, and a very
                    large projecting portico. Its construction is an interesting example of the
                    Roman use of many different materials. The lower part of the walls was of
                    massive tufa blocks, the upper part of the cella of travertine; and the inner
                    low wall, which supported ranges of internal columns, was of mixed concrete,
                    tufa and travertine. The whole was lined with marble, white outside, and rich
                    oriental marbles inside (see fig. 4), which were also used for the pavement. The
                    door-sill is made of enormous blocks of porta santa marble, in whicha bronze
                    caduceus (emblem of Mercury) was inlaid. Between the internal columns of the
                    cella stood rows of statues; and the temple also contained a large collection of
                    pictures, engraved gems, gold and silver plate, and other works of art, mostly

                    iron clamps; the whole was lined with white Pentelic marble outside, and inside
                    with coloured oriental marbles. There was an internal range of columns, as in

                    of the Forum; the remains of the ancient travertine curb show, that originally
                    the road went along a rather different line, and was probably altered to make
                    room for this great arch, which was accessible only by steps, and was not used
                    for ordinary traffic. It was built in <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 203, after
                    victories in Parthia, and was originally set up in honour of Severus and his two
                    sons M. Aurelius Antoninus (Caracalla) and Geta. Caracalla, after murdering
                    Geta, erased his name from all monuments to his honour in Rome. Representations
                    of the arch on coins of Severus show that its attic was surmounted by a chariot
                    of bronze drawn by six horses, in which stood Severus crowned by Victory; at the
                    sides were statues of Caracalla and Geta, with an equestrian statue at each
                    angle. The arch, except the base, which is of marble-lined travertine, is built
                    of massive blocks of Pentelic marble, and has large crowded reliefs of victories
                    in the East, showing much decadence from the best period of Roman art.</p>               <p>The central space of the Forum is paved with slabs of travertine, much patched
                    at various dates; it appears to have been marked out into compartments with
                    incised lines (see Plate VIII.), the use of which is not known. There are also
                    square holes which probably held masts on which awnings could be spread.
                    Numerous clamp-holes all over the paving show where statues and other ornaments
                    once stood. The recorded number of these is very great, and they must once have
                    thickly crowded a great part of the central area. Two short marble walls or
                    plutei covered with reliefs, discovered in 1872, stand on the north side. The
                    rough travertine plinth on which they have been set is evidently of late date.
                    Each of these marble screens has (on the inside) reliefs of a fat bull, boar and
                    ram, decked out with sacrificial wreaths and vittae—the suovetaurilia. On the

                    the temple of Castor and the arch of Augustus. On the right are the statue of

                    reliefs have been given, but the above appears the most probable. Towards the
                    other end of the Forum are remains of a large concrete pedestal. It may possibly
                    have supported an equestrian statue of Constantine, wnich was still standing in
                    the 8th century. A smaller foundation, laid bare by Comm. Boni’s excavations in
                    1905, is thought by him to have supported the equestrian statue of Q. Marcius
                    Tremulus, the conqueror of the Hcrnici, set up before the temple of Castor in
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 305 (Liv. ix. 43). t The seven cubical brick
                    and concrete structures, once faced with marble, which line the Sacra Via are
                    not earlier than the time of Diocletian. They are probably the pedestals of
                    honorary columns such as those shown in the relief on Constantine’s arch,
                    mentioned above. The column erected in honour of the tyrant Phocas by Smaragdus
                    in the eleventh year of his exarchate (608) is still stanching. It is a fine
                    marble Corinthian column, stolen from some earlier building; it stands on rude
                    steps of marble and tufa. The name of Phocas is erased from the inscription; but
                    the date shows that this monument was to his honour. In the 4th century, or
                    perhaps even later, a long brick and concrete building faced with marble was
                    built along the whole south-east end of the Forum, probably a row of shops. They
                    were destroyed by Comm. Rosa’s order. Two columns—one of pavonazzetto, the other
                    of grey granite—were set up on two of the brick bases in 1899.</p>               <p>In 1902 a network of passages <hi rend="italic">(cuniculi)</hi> was discovered
                    about 3 ft. beneath the pavement of the Forum. These have tufa walls and
                    concrete vaults; they are about 8 ft. high and 5 ft. broad. At the intersections
                    of the passages arc square chambers, in the centre of which are travertine
                    blocks with sockets for windlasses. The construction of the passages seems to
                    date from the time of Julius Caesar, and it is thought that they were used for
                    scenic purposes when games were given in the Forum.</p>               <p>In 1903 a large concrete foundation was found, partly blocking the E. end of one
                    of the <hi rend="italic">cuniculi.</hi> There can be no doubt that this once
                    supported the colossal equestrian statue of Domitian described by Statius (Silv.
                    i. 1, 21 ff.) which was destroyed after his murder. Embedded in the concrete was
                    a cist.of massive travertine blocks which was found to contain five archaic
                    vases similar to those from the early necropolis (above, <hi rend="italic">as
                        init.).</hi> One held a nugget of quartz containing pure gold. . It is
                    uncertain whether these were buried here for ritual purposes or were the
                    contents of an early tomb found in digging the foundations. Near.this monument
                    there were found in 1904 remains of an enclosure of irregular shape which once
                    contained an altar. This must have been the altar which in imperial times
                    represented the Lacus Curtius (Ov. <hi rend="italic">Fast.</hi> vi. 403). Beside
                    this were found some remains of a structure of imperial date which Comm. Boni
                    identified with the Tribunal at which justice was administered by the emperors.

                    times as w-atcr reservoirs. Two ancient well-shafts lined with tufa communicate
                    with these subterranean hollows. Extensive foundations of hard tufa exist in the
                    valley afterwards covered by the Flavian palace (see Plan, “ Foundations of the
                    Domus Augustana ”). The masonry is in parts of republican date, and was used to
                    support the Flavian palace. Not far from the top of the Scalae Caci are the
                    massive remains of a large cclla, nothing of which now exists except the

                    part of the cornice of the pediment, cut in peperino, and thickly coated with
                    hard white stucco to imitate marble. Between this and the temple of Jupiter
                    Victor are extensive remains of a large porticus, with tufa walls and travertine
                    piers, also republican in date. The use and name of this building.are unknown.</p>               <p>Remains of extensive lines of buildings in early <hi rend="italic">opus

                    Velabrum side, and on the south-w'est side as far as the so-called Paedagogium.
                    These buildings are constructed on the ruins of the wall of Romulus, a great
                    part of which has been cut away to make room for them; their base is at the foot
                    of the ancient wall, on the shelf cut midway in the side of the hill; their top
                    reached originally above the upper level of the summit. They are of various
                    dates, and cannot be identified with any known buildings. Part is apparently of
                    the time of the emperor Tiberius, and no doubt belongs to the Domus Tiberiana
                    mentioned by Suetonius <hi rend="italic">(Tib.</hi> 5; Tac.</p>               <p>                   <hi rend="italic">Hist.</hi> i. 27, iii. 71); this palace covered a great part
                    of the west corner of the hill. Of about the same date is a very interesting and
                    well-preserved private house built wholly of <hi rend="italic">opus
                        reticulatum,</hi> which formed part of the imperial property, and was
                    respected when the later palaces were built. The discovery of lead-pipes bearing

                    house was that bequeathed to Li via by her first husband, Tib. Claudius Nero. At
                    the north-west end is a small atrium, out of which open three rooms commonly

                    three storeys high, and is divided into a great number of very small rooms,
                    mostly bedrooms. The house is built in a sort .of hole against the side of an
                    elevation, so that the upper floor behind is level with an ancient paved road..
                    The dampness caused by this is counteracted and kept off the paintings by a
                    lining of flange-tiles over the external walls, under the stucco, thus forming
                    an air-cavity all over the surface. From the back of the house, at the upper
                    level, along subterranean passage leads towards the Flavian palace, and then,
                    turning at right angles and passing by the foundations of the so-called temple
                    of Jupiter Victor, issues, in the ancient tufa building mentioned above. Another
                    crypto-porticus starts near this house and communicates with the long
                    semi-subterranean passage by which the palaces of Caligula and Domitian are
                    connected. It is ornamented with very beautiful stucco reliefs of cupids, beasts
                    and foliage, once painted and gilt. Some hold that the house was that of
                    Germanicus, into which the soldiers who killed Caligula in the long
                    crypto-porticus escaped, as described by Josephus <hi rend="italic">(Ant.

                    used in the founding of the city were deposited. To the east was the Area
                    Apollinis, the entrance of which led through lofty propylaea into a very
                    extensive peristyle or porticus, with columns of Numidian giallo; the temple was
                    of white Luna marble. In the centre of this enclosure stood the great octostyle
                    peripteral temple of Apollo Palatinus. The splendour of its architecture and the

                    Inside the cclla were statues of Apollo between Latona and Diana by Scopas,

                    death of the Niobids and the defeat of the Gauls at Delphi. The Ancyran
                    inscription records that Augustus melted down eighty silver statues of himself
                    and with the money “ offered golden gifts ” to this temple, dedicating them both
                    in his own name and in the names of the original donors of the statues. <note

                    literature, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="83"> chol.

                    of the fifty Danaids, and opposite them their fifty bridegrooms on horseback
                    (see Schol. on Pers. ii. 56). In the centre, before the steps of the temple,
                    stood an altar surrounded by four oxen, the work of Myron (Prop. iii. 31, 5). In
                    the centre of the,Palatine stood the palace of Augustus, built in the years
                    following 36 B.c., and renewed after a fire in A.D. 3. It
                    contained a small temple of Vesta <hi rend="italic">{C.I.L.</hi> i. p. 317),
                    dedicated on the 28th of April 12 B.c., when Augustus was elected <hi

                    group of buildings suffered in the fire of Nero, and were restored by Domi tian.
                    The whole was finally destroyed in the great fire of 363 (Ammian. xxiii. 3, 3),
                    but the Sibylline books were saved.</p>               <p>To the north-west of the Area Palatina stood the Domus Tiberiana, a palace built
                    by Tiberius on substructures of concrete which cro^yn the north-west slope of
                    the hill and form a platform nowoccu pied by the Farnese gardens, overlooking
                    the Clivus Victoriae. Caligula is said to have added to this palace on the side
                    towards the Forum, making the temple of Castor into a vestibule, and to have
                    connected it with the Capitol by a bridge whose piers were found by the temple
                    of Augustus and the Basilica Julia; but this was destroyed after his death. At a
                    later time the palace was extended so as to include the northern angle of the
                    Palatine, which had once been covered with private houses. Among these were the
                    dwellings of Q. Lutatius Catulus, Q. Hortensius, Scaurus, Crassus (Piin. <hi
                        rend="italic">II.N.</hi> xxxvi. 3, 24), whose house was afterwards bought by

                    </note> Many other wealthy Romans had houses on this part of the Palatine. The
                    part now existing is little more than the gigantic substructure built to raise
                    the principal rooms to the level of the top of the hill. The lowest parts of
                    these face the Nova Via, opposite the Atrium Vestae, and many,storeys of, small
                    vaulted rooms built in mixed brick and <hi rend="italic">opus reticulatum</hi>
                    rise one above the other to the higher levels. <note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial" n="85"> At this point the Palatine is cut
                        away into four stages like gigantic steps; the lowest is the floor of the
                        Atrium Vestae, the second the Nova Via, the third the Clivus Victoriae, and
                        the top of the hill forms the fourth. </note> The palace extends over the
                    Clivus Victoriae, supported on lofty arches so as to leave the road unblocked;
                    many travertine or marble stairs lead to the upper rooms, some starting from the
                    Nova Via, others from the Clivus Victoriae. A large, proportion of these
                    substructures consist of dark rooms, some with no means .of lighting, others
                    with scanty borrowed light. Many small rooms and stairs scarcely 2 ft. wide can
                    only have been used by* slaves. The ground floors on the,Nova Via and the Clivus
                    Victoriae appear to have , been shops, judging from their wide openings, with
                    travertine sills, grooved for the wooden fronts with narrow doors, which Roman
                    shops seem always to have had—very like those now used in the East. The upper
                    and principal rooms were ,once richly decorated with marble linings, columns and
                    mosaics; but little of these now remains. The upper part of the palace, that
                    above the. Clivus Victoriae, is faced wholly with brickwork, no <hi
                        rend="italic">opus reticulatum</hi> being used as in the lower portions by
                    the Nova Via. This marks a difference of date, and this is confirmed by the
                    occurrence of brick stamps of the</p>               <p>2nd century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
               </p>               <p>The next great addition to the buildings of the Palatine was the magnificent
                    suite of state apartments built by Domitian, over a deep natural valley running
                    across the hill (see Plan).</p>               <p>The valley was filled up and the level of the new palace raised to a
                    considerable height above the natural soil.</p>               <p>Remains of a house, decorated with painting and rich marbles, exist under
                    Domitian's peristyle, partly destroyed by the foundations of cast concrete which
                    cut right through it. The floor of this house shows the original level, far
                    below that of the Flavian palace. This building is connected with the palace of
                    Caligula by a brandy subterranean passage leading into the earlier
                    crypto-porticus. ft consists of a block of state-rooms,, in the- centre of which
                    is a large open peristyle, with columns of oriental marble, at one end of which
                    is the grand triclinium with magnificent paving of opus sectile in red and green
                    basalt and coloured marbles, a piece of which is well preserved; next to the
                    triclinium, on to whicn it opens with large windows, is a nymphaeum or room with
                    marble-lined, fountain and recesses for plants and statues. On the opposite side
                    of the peristyle is a large throne-room, the walls of which were adorned with
                    rows of pavonazzetto and giallo columns and large marble niches, in which were
                    colossal statues of porphyry and basalt; at one side of this is the basilica,
                    with central nave and apse and narrow aisles, over which were galleries. The
                    apse, in which was the emperor’s throne, is screened off by open marble
                    cancelli, a part of which still exists. It is of great interest as showing the
                    origin of the Christian basilica (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Basilica).</hi>

                    throne-room is the lararium, with altar and pedestal for a statue; next to this
                    is the grand staircase, which led to the upper rooms, now destroyed. The whole
                    building, both floor and walls, was covered with the richest oriental marbles.
                    Outside were colonnades or porticus,— on one side of cipollino, on the other of
                    travertine, the latter stuccoed and painted. The magnificence of the whole,
                    crowded with fine Greek sculpture and covered with polished marbles of the most
                    brilliant colours, is difficult now to realize; a glowing description is given
                    by, Statius <hi rend="italic">{Silv.</hi> iv. 11, 18; see also Plut. <hi
                        rend="italic">Poplic.</hi> 15, and Mart. viii. 36). Doors were arranged in
                    the throne-room and basilica so that the emperor could slip out unobserved and
                    reach by a staircase (g on Plan) the crypto-porticus which communicates with
                    Caligula’s palace. The vault of this passage was covered with mosaic of mixed
                    marble and glass, a few fragments of which still remain; its walls were lined
                    with rich marbles; it was lighted by a series of windows in the springing of the
                    vault. This, as well as the Flavian palace, appears to have suffered more than
                    once,from fire, and in many places important restorations of the time of
                    Severus, and some as late as the 4th century, are evident. In 1720-28 extensive
                    excavations were made here for the Farnese duke of Parma, and an immense
                    quantity of statues and marble architectural fragments were discovered, many of
                    which are now at Naples and elsewhere. Among them were sixteen beautiful fluted
                    columns of pavonazzetto and giallo, fragments of the basalt statues, and an
                    immense door-sill of Pentelic marble, now used for the high altar of the
                    Pantheon; these all came from the throne-room. The excavations were carried on
                    by Bianchini, wfio published a book on the subject. <note anchored="true"

                    a level, uniform with the top of the hill, on which the grand apartments stood.
                    The whole height from the base of the Palatine to several storeys above its
                    summit must have been enormous. Little now remains of the highest storeys,
                    except part of a grand staircase which led to them. Extensive baths, originally

                    Palatine were supplied with water by an aqueduct built by Nero in continuation
                    of the Claudian agueduct, some arches of which still exist on the slope of the

                    angle, Septimius Severus built an outlying part of his palace, a building of

                    rebuilt the. temple of Victory, which gave its name to the Clivus Victoriae;
                    this temple stood on the site of a prehistoric altar (Dionys. i. 32), and was
                    more than once rebuilt,—e.g. by L. Postumius, 294 B.c. (Liv. x. 33).</p>               <p>In 193 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> an aedicula to Victory was built near it

                        24). Owing to the strength of its position this temple was more than once
                        selected during troubled times as a safe meeting-place for the Senate; it
                        was here, as being a “ locus munitissimus,” that Cicero delivered his <hi

                    temple was of Parian marble, with Corinthian columns of Numidian giallo antico.
                    The Sacra Via started at the Sacellum Streniae, an unknown point on the
                    Esquiline, probably in the valley of the Colosseum (Varro, <hi rend="italic"
                        >L.L. v.</hi> 47), in the quarter called Cerolia. Thence it probably (in
                    later times) passed round part of the Colosseum to the slope leading up to the
                    arch of Titus on the Velia; this piece of its course is lined on one side by
                    remains of private houses, and farther back, against the cliff of the Palatine,
                    are the substructures of the Area Apollinis. From the arch of Titus or Summa
                    Sacra Via the original line of the road has been altered, probably when the
                    temple of Venus and Rome was built by Hadrian. Its later course passed at a
                    sharp angle from the arch</p>               <p>of Titus to the front of Constantine’s basilica, and on past the temple of
                    Faustina. It is uncertain, whether the continuation of this road to the arch of
                    Severus was in later times called the Sacra Via or whether it rejoined its old
                    line along the Basilica Julia by the cross-road in front of the Aedes Julii. Its
                    original line past the temple of Vesta was completely built over in the 3rd and
                    4th centuries, and clumsily fitted pavements of marble and travertine occupy the
                    place of the old basalt blocks. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Till 1348, when the steps up to Ara Coeli were built, there was no access to the
                    Capitol from the back; hence the three ascents to it mentioned by Livy (iii. 7,
                    v. 26-28) and Tacitus <hi rend="italic">(Hist.</hi> iii. 71-72) were all from
                    the inside of the Servian circuit. Even on this inner side it was defended by a
                    wall, the gates in which are called “ Capitolii fores ” by Tacitus. Part of the
                    outer wall at the top of the tufa rock, which is cut into a smooth cliff, is
                    visible from the modern Vicolo della Rupe Tarpeia; this cliff is traditionally
                    called the Tarpcian rock, but that must have been on the other side towards the
                    Forum, from whence it was visible, as is clearly stated by Dionysius (vii. 35,

                    Doric arcade has capitals, imposts and entablature of travertine. Above the

                    few architectural members have been found. The columns appear to have belonged

                    of steps leading from the temple of Concord and the Forum up to the temple of
                    Juno Moneta on the Arx. The entrance from the Clivus Capitolinus is by a wide
                    flat arch of peperino beautifully jointed; the other end wall has been mostly
                    destroyed. The back of this building overlooked the Asylum</p>               <p>or depression between the two peaks. From this higher level a long steep

                    of the city of Rome (see below, p. 608). The original plan was probably burnt

                    (Dio Cass, lxxii. 24); but a new plan was made, and the building restored in
                    concrete and brick by Severus. The north end wall, with the clamps for fixing
                    the marble plan, still exists, as does also the other (restored) end wall with

                    of Augustus and Vespasian; being little more than a richly decorated street, it
                    was called the Forum Transitorium or Forum Palladium, from the temple to Minerva
                    which it contained. It was begun by Domitian, and dedicated by Nerva in 97 (see

                    fora, it was surrounded by a peperino wall, not only lined with marble but also
                    decorated with rows of Corinthian columns supporting a rich entablature with
                    sculptured frieze. Two columns and part of this wall still exist; on the frieze
                    are reliefs of weaving, fulling and various arts which were under the protection
                    oi Minerva.. A great part of the temple existed till the time of Paul V., who in

                    size, the most magnificent of all; it was in progress from 113 to 117, at least.
                    A great.spur of hill, which connected the Capitoline with the Quirinal, was cut
                    away to make a level site for this enormous group of buildings, ft consisted
                    (see fig. 11). of a large dipteral peristyle, with curved projections,.lined
                    with shops on the side. That against the slope of the Quirinal, three storeys
                    high, still partly exists. The main entrance was through a. triumphal arch (Dio
                    Cass, lxviii. 20). Aurei.of Trajan show this arch and other parts of his forum.

                        the site, and is so explained by Dion Cass, (lxviii. 16). It is impossible
                        that the saddle connecting the Quirinal with the Capitoline hill can have
                        been 100 ft. in height (Brocchi, <hi rend="italic">Suolo di Roma,</hi> p.

                        is much exaggerated. Comm. Boni has found the remains of a road beneath the

                    similar to that of the temple of Vesta in the forum (fig. 8), and, except the

               <p>preserved. It may date from the 2nd century B.c. The
                    neighbouring Ionic temple, popularly called of Fortuna Virilis, is of special
                    interest from its early date, probably the end of the 3rd century <hi

                        in its present form dates from the 1st century B.c. </note> It has a
                    prostyle tetrastyle portico of travertine, and a short cella of tufa with
                    engaged columns; the bases of these and of the angle columns are of travertine.
                    The frieze has reliefs of ox skulls and garlands. The whole was originally
                    stuccoed and painted so that the different stones used would not show. Fig. 12
                    gives the plan, showing the hard travertine used at the points of greatest
                    pressure, while the main walls with the half columns are of the weaker and</p>               <p>I softer tufa. The dedication of this temple is doubtful; but it is probably
                    either that of Fortuna or of Mater Matuta, both of which were destroyed by fire
                    in 213 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> and restored in the following year. The
                    church of S. Maria in Cosmedin contains some remains of a temple (Plan, No. 4)
                    which has been identified with that of Hercules built by Pompey <hi

                    of the Circus . Maximus, in the Forum Boarium. The columns built up in the
                    church did not, however, belong to a temple, but to a porticus. Within the walls
                    of S. Niccolo in Carcere in the Forum Holitorium (Plan, No. 18) are preserved
                    remains of three small hexastyle peripteral temples, two Ionic and one Tuscan,

                    built in honour of Octavia by her brother Augustus on the site of the Porticus

                    rebuilt under the same name by Augustus, as is recorded in the Ancyran
                    inscription. The whole group was one of the most magnificent in Rome, and
                    contained a large number of works of art by Pheidias and other Greek sculptors.
                    The existing portico, which was the main entrance into the porticus, is a

                    it was pseudo-dipteral, with ten Corinthian columns of Greek marble at the ends,
                    and probably twenty at the sides; it had an outer colonnade round the peribolus
                    of about 180 columns of polished granite. Of these only a few fragments now
                    exist; for several centuries</p>               <p>the whole area of this building was used as a quariy, while the residue of the
                    marble was burnt into lime on the spot in kilns built of broken fragments of the
                    porphyry columns. A considerable part of the two cellae with their apses, set
                    back to back, still exists; in each apse was a colossal seated figure of the
                    deity, and along the side walls of the cellae were rows of porphyry columns and
                    statues in niches. The vault is deeply coffered with stucco enrichments once
                    painted and gilt. The roof was covered w’ith tiles of gilt bronze, which were
                    taken by Pope Honorius I. (625-38) to cover the basilica of St Peter’s., These
                    were stolen by the Saracens during their sack of the Leonine city in 846. The
                    emperor Hadrian himself designed this magnificent, temple, which was partially
                    completed in 135; the design was criticized severely by the architect
                    Apollo-dorus (Dio .Cass. lxix. 4; <hi rend="italic">Vita lladr.</hi> 19). The
                    temple was probably finished by Antoninus Pius; it was partly burned in the
                    reign of Maxentius, who began its restoration, which was carried on by
                    Constantine. The existing remains of the two cellae are mainly of Hadrian’s
                    time, but contain patches of the later restorations. Between the south angle of
                    this temple and the arch of Constantine stand the remains of a fountain, usually
                    known as the Meta Sudans. This was a tall conical structure in a large circular
                    basin, all lined with marble. From its brick facing it appears to be a work of
                    the Flavian period.</p>               <p>That part of the Caelian hill which is near the Colosseum is covered with very
                    extensive remains—a great peribolus of brickfaced. concrete, apparently of
                    Flavian date, and part of a massive travertine arcade in two storeys, similar to
                    that of the Colosseum; most of the latter has been removed for the sake of the
                    stone, but a portion still exists under the monastery and campanile of SS.

                    slope of the Esquiline (so named ftom a statue found in it), a curiously planned
                    budding, with central decagonal domed hall, probably belonged to the palace of
                    Gallienus (263-68). Somewhat similar ruins beside the neighbouring basilica of
                    S. Croce formed part of the Sessorium, a palace on the Esquiline. The remains on
                    the Quirinal, in the Colonna gardens, of massive marble entablatures richly
                    sculptured were formerly thought to belong to Aurelian's great temple of the
                    Sun, but it now appears certain that they belong to the very extensive thermae
                    of Constantine, part of the site of which is now occupied by the Quirinal palace
                    and neighbouring buildings. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    destroyed. The laying out of the new Quirinal and Esquiline quarters has also
                    exposed many fine buildings. Some remains on the Esquiline have been supposed
                    (without much probability) to belong to the villa of Maecenas. A very remarkable

                    with many rooms and staircases round it, rising four storeys high. This house
                    was set in the valley against a cliff of the Quirinal, so that the third floor
                    is level with the upper part of the hill. It is nearly on the line of the
                    Servian wall, which stood here at a higher level on the edge of the cliff. This
                    park was laid out by the historian Sallust, and remained in the possession of
                    his family until the reign of Tiberius, when it became imperial property; it was
                    used as a residence by Nero (Tac. <hi rend="italic">Ann.</hi> xiii. 47) and

                    marble linings and mosaics. The line of the street was parallel to that of the
                    later Aurelian wall, which at this part was built against the back of this row
                    of houses. At the same time, behind the line of houses were uncovered fine
                    peperino and tufa piers of the aqueduct rebuilt by Augustus, one arch of which
                    forms the Porta S. Lorenzo. These interesting remains have all been completely

                    destroyed to make room for new buildings.</p>               <p>The praetorian camp was first made permanent and surrounded with a strong wall
                    by the emperor Tiberius (Suet. <hi rend="italic">Tib,</hi> 37). Owing to the
                    camp being included in the line of tne Aurelian wall, a great part of it still
                    exists; it is a very interesting specimen of early imperial brick-facing. The
                    wall is only</p>               <p>12 to 14 ft. high, and has thinly scattered battlements, at intervals of 20 ft.
                    The north-east gate (Poria <hi rend="italic">Principalis I)extra)</hi> is well
                    preserved; it had a tower on each side, now greatly reduced in height, in which
                    are small window's with arched heads moulded in one slab of terra-cotta. The
                    brick-facing is very neat and regular,—the bricks being about IJ in. thick, with
                    i-in. joints. On the inside of the wall are rows of small rooms for the guards.
                    Part of the Porta Praetoria also remains. . This camp was dismantled by
                    Constantine, who removed its inner walls; the outer ones were left because they
                    formed part of the Aurelian circuit. The present wall is nearly three times the
                    height of the original camp wall. The upper part was added when Aurelian
                    included it in his general circuit wall, round Rome. The superior neatness and
                    beauty of Tiberius's brick-facing make it easy to distinguish where his work
                    ends and that of the later emperors begins. Owing to the addition of the later
                    wall it requires some care to trace the rows of battlements which belong to the

                    Syracusan bronze (xxxiv. 7). It was long supposed that the present rotunda was
                    the Pantheon of Agrippa; but this was destroyed in the great fire of <hi

                    investigations have shown that the rotunda is a work of Hadrian's reign, bricks
                    of that period having been found in all parts of the building. Excavations have
                    made it probable that the site of the rotunda was previously occupied by an open
                    piazza, whose pavement of coloured marbles has been discovered beneath the
                    flooring, and that Agrippa's Pantheon covered the present piazza and faced
                    southward. The present portico has been reconstructed; it is probable that
                    Agrippa's portico had ten columns in the front. The ceiling of the portico too

                    they were seized by the Saracens. The portico has eight columns on the front and

                    concrete, thinly faced with brick. The enormous dome, 142 ft. 6 in. in span, is
                    cast in concrete made of pumice-stone, pozzolana and lime; being one solid mass,
                    it covers the building like a shell, free from any lateral thrust at the
                    haunches. On the face of the concrete is a system of superimposed relieving
                    arches in brick. These no longer possess any constructive value, but were
                    designed to preserve the stability of the dome whilst the concrete became,
                    firmly, set. Round the central opening or hypae-thrum. still remains a ring of
                    enriched mouldings in gilt Ijronze, the only bit left of the bronze which once
                    covered the whole dome. The lower storey of the circular part and the walls of
                    the projecting portico were covered with slabs of Greek marble; a great part of
                    the latter still remains, enriched with Corinthian pilasters and bands of
                    sculptured ornament. The two upper storeys of the drum were covered outside with
                    hard stucco of pounded marble. Inside the whole was lined with a great variety
                    of rich oriental marbles. This magnificent interior, divided into two orders by

                    lakes, &amp;c., covered an incredibly large space of ground, extending from
                    the Palatine, over the Velia and the site of the temple of Venus and Rome, to
                    the Esquiline, filling the great valley between the Caelian and the Esquiline
                    where the Colosseum stands, and reaching far over the Esquiline to the great
                    reservoir now called the “ Sette Sale.” No other extravagances or cruelties of
                    Nero appear to have offended the Roman people so much as the erection of this
                    enormous palace, which must have blocked up many important roads and occupied
                    the site of a whole populous quarter. It was partly to make restitution for this
                    enormous theft of land that Vespasian and Titus destroyed the Golden House and
                    built the Colosseum and Thermae of Titus on part of its site. Adjoining the
                    baths of Titus were thosé built on a much larger scale by Trajan. Under the
                    substructions of these extensive remains of the Golden House still exist; <note

                        built. </note> and at one point, at a lower level still, pavements and
                    foundations remain of one of the numerous houses destroyed by Nero to clear the
                    site. The great bronze colossus of Nero, 120 ft. high (Suet. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Nero,</hi> 31), which stood in one of the porticus of the Golden House, was
                    moved by Vespasian, with head and attributes altered to those of Apollo
                    (Helios), on to the Velia; and it was moved again by Hadrian, when the temple of
                    Rome was built, on to the base which still exists near the Colosseum. Several
                    coins show this colossus by the side of the Colosseum.</p>               <p>Under the Palazzo Doria, the church of S. Maria in Via Lata, and other,
                    neighbouring buildings extensive remains exist of a great, porticus,. with long
                    rows of travertine piers; this building, is designated on fragments of the
                    marble plan with the words SAEPT .... LIA. This must be the
                    Saepta Julia, begun by Julius Caesar, and completed by Agrippa in 27 B.c., as the voting place for the Comitia Centnriata,
                    divided into compartments, one for each century. The building contained rostra,
                    and was also used for gladiatorial shows. Under the later empire it became a

                        >H.N.</hi> xxxvi. 102), the upper being still of wood (Suet. <hi

                    after this rebuilding. 11 was further ornamented with marble by Augustus,
                    Claudius and other emperors. The wooden part was burnt in the great fire of
                    Nero, and again under Domitian; it was considerably enlarged by Trajan, and
                    lastly it was restored by Constantine. In its later state it had a marble façade
                    with three external tiers of arches with engaged columns, and (inside) sloping
                    tiers of marble seats, supported on concrete raking vaults (Plin. <hi

                    16th century, and is shown by Du Perac. It is said by Pliny <hi rend="italic"
                        >(H.N.</hi> xxxvi. 102)—if the text be not corrupt—to have held 250,000
                    spectators, while the Regionary Catalogues give the number of seats as 485,000;

                    that the figures are much exaggerated and must, moreover, be interpreted, not of
                    the number of spectators, but of the length of the tiers expressed in feet. The
                    end with the carceres was near the church of S. Maria in Cosmedin. <note

                    middle ages its long open space was used as a rope-walk, hence the name of the

                    restored by Severus Alexander. That it was a stadium and not a circus is shown
                    by the fact that its starting end is at right angles to the sides and not set
                    diagonally, as was always the case with the carceres of a circus; nor is there

                    by Titus in his father’s reign. Reliefs inside the arch represent the triumphal
                    procession—Titus in a chariot, and on the other side soldiers bearing the golden
                    candlestick, trumpets and table of prothesis, taken from the Jewish temple. The
                    central part only of this monument is original; the sides were restored in 1823.

                    carries the specus of an aqueduct—that built by Caracalla to supply his great
                    thermae. Its composite capitals show, however, that it is later than the time of
                    Drusus, and it was very possibly the work of Trajan. Adjoining the church of S.
                    Giorgio in Velabro a rich though coarsely, decorated marble gateway with fiat

                    Forum Boarium in 204. It formed an entrance from the Forum Boarium into the
                    Velabrum. The figure of Geta in the reliefs and his name have been erased by
                    Caracalla; the sculpture is poor both in design and execution (see <hi

                    Constantine. It owes, however, little of its beauty to that artistically
                    degraded period. Not only most of its reliefs but its whole design and many of
                    its architectural features were stolen from an earlier arch erected by Trajan as
                    an entrance to his forum (see above). The arch of Claudius, built in 43 to
                    commemorate his supposed victories in Britain, stood across the Via Lata (modern

                    surmounted by a quadriga and trophies. A little to the N. of the Piazza Colonna
                    was an arch popularly called the Arco di Portogallo, destroyed in 1665, whose
                    reliefs are now in the Palazzo dei Conservatori. They appear to date from the
                    reign of Hadrian, but may have been used at a later time to decorate this arch.
                    An arch also stood opposite S. Maria in Via Lata until 1498, which was probably
                    erected by Diocletian in <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 303. The central part of
                    the once triple arch of Gallicnus still exists on the Esquiline; it took the
                    place of the ancient Porta Esquilina of the Servian wall. It is built of
                    travertine, is simple in design, with coarse details, and has an inscription on
                    its attic. The two side arches and pediment over the centre existed in the 16th

                    incription, recording that it was cut in the ninth year of Trajan’s reign, under
                    the supervision of Dioscurus and the architect Aristides. The rest of its
                    fragments were used by Pius VI. to repair the obelisk of Monte Citorio, set up
                    by Augustus in the Campus Martius as the gnomon of a sundial (Plin. Z/.AT.
                    xxxvi. 72). The .marble pedestal of the Antonine column is now in the Vatican;
                    it has reliefs representing the apotheosis of Faustina and Antoninus Pius, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">decursio equitum</hi> which formed part of the funeral
                    ceremony. This and the column of M. Aurelius were both surmounted by colossal
                    portrait statues of gilt bronze. The column of M. Aurelius is very similar in
                    size and design to that of Trajan. Its spiral reliefs represent victories in
                    Germany from 171-175, arranged in twenty tiers. Like the column of Trajan, it is
                    exactly. 100 Roman ft. high, without the pedestal. The pedestal was originally
                    much higher.than at present, but is now partly buried; it is shown by Gamucci,
                    Du P6rac and other 16th-century writers. This column stood in front of a temple
                    to M. Aurelius, and within a great peribolus, forming a forum similar to that of
                    Trajan, though much smaller; the remains of this temple, amongst other
                    buildings, probably form the elevation nqw</p>               <p>called Monte Citorio. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    of early date which still exists. It is excavated in the tufa rock at the side
                    of the Via Appia, outside the Porta Capena. Interments of the Scipio family went
                    on here for about 400 years, additional chambers and passages being excavated
                    from time to time. The peperino sarcophagus of Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus

                    </note> At many periods these walls suffered much more from the attacks of the
                    Goths (Procop. <hi rend="italic">Beil. Goth.</hi> iii. 22, 2^.), and were
                    restored successively by Theodoric (about 500), by Belisarius (about 560), and
                    by various popes during the 8th and 9th centuries, and in fact all through the
                    middle ages. A great part of the Aurelian wall still exists in a more or less
                    perfect state; but it has wholly vanished where it skirted the river, and a
                    great part of its trans-Tiberine course is gone. The best-preserved pieces are
                    between Porta Pinciana and Porta Salaria (in which breaches have lately been
                    made for streets), and between the Lateran and the Amphitheatrum Castrense. The
                    wall, of concrete, has the usual brick-facing and is about 12 ft. thick, with a
                    guard’s passage formed in its thickness. Fig. 13 shows its plan: on the inside
                    the</p>               <p>passage has tall open arches, which look like those of an aqueduct, and at
                    regular intervals of about 45 ft. massive square towers are built, projecting on
                    the outside of the wall, in three storeys, the top storey rising above the top
                    of the wall. The height of the wall varies according to the eontour of the
                    ground; in parts it was about 60 ft. high outside and 40 inside. Necessaria,
                    supported on two travertine corbels, projected from the top of the wall on the
                    outside beside most of the towers. The Einsiedeln MS. gives a description of the
                    complete circuit, counting fourteen gates, as follows:—</p>               <p>Porta S. Petri (at the Pons Aelius, destroyed); P. Flaminia (replaced by P. del
                    Popolo); P. Pinciana (in use); P. Salaria (now P. Salara); P. Nomentana
                    (replaced by P. Pia); P. Tiburtina (now P. S. Lorenzo); P. Praenestina (now P.
                    Maggiore); P. Asinaria (replaced by P. San Giovanni); P. Metrovia or Metroni
                    (closed); P. Latina (closed); P. Appia (now P. S. Sebastiano); P. Ostiensis (now
                    P. S. Paolo). On the Janiculan side, P. Portuensis (destroyed); P. Aurelia (now
                    Porta San Pancrazio). Besides these there was a gate, now closed (Porta Chiusa),
                    to the south of the Castra Praetoria; and in all probability a gate on the right
                    bank of the Tiber, replaced by the modern Porta Settimiana.</p>               <p>These existing gates are mostly of the time of Honorius; each is flanked by a
                    projecting tower, and some are double, with a second pair of towers inside.
                    Several have grooves for a portcullis <hi rend="italic">(catara eta)</hi> in the
                    outer arch. The handsomest gate is the P. Appia, with two massive outer towers,
                    three stages high, the upper semicircular in plan. Many of the gates of Honorius
                    have Christian symbols or inscriptions. The general design of all these gates is
                    much the same—a central archway, with a row of windows over it and two flanking
                    towers, some square, others semicircular in plan. In many of the gates older
                    materials are used, blocks of tufa, travertine, or marble. The doors themselves
                    swung on pivots, the bottom ones let into a hole in the threshold, the upper
                    into projecting corbels.</p>               <p>At many points alon^ the line of the Aurelian wall older buildings form part of

                    reproduces the bronze tablets set up by. Augustus on his mausoleum at Rome, and
                    contains a list of the buildings which he erected or restored. The marble plan
                    of Rome <hi rend="italic">(Forma urbis Romae,</hi> ed. Jordan, 1874; the more
                    recently discovered fragments have only been published in periodicals) dates
                    from the reign of Septimius Scverus, who restored the building to which it
                    belonged after the fire of 191 B.C. The plan which it
                    replaced was executed by order of Vespasian. The scale was generally 1: 250; it
                    was oriented with S.E. at the top, N.W# at the bottom. Buildings are of course
                    frequently represented on coins and works of art, and these may often be
                    identified with existing remains.</p>               <p>In the reign of Constantine the Great there was compiled a catalogue of the
                    principal buildings of Rome, arranged according to the fourteen regions of
                    Augustus. This has been preserved in two recensions, one made in <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 334 and known as the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Notitia,</hi> the second in or about <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 357,
                    and known as the <hi rend="italic">Curiosum urbis Romae.</hi> These are. called
                    the Regionary Catalogues, and contain, besides lists of buildings, statistics as
                    to the number of vici, domus, insulae, &amp;c., in each region, which are of
                    great value. (See Preller, <hi rend="italic">Regionen der Stadt Rom,</hi> Jena,
                    1846.)</p>               <p>In the middle ages, guide-books were written for the use of pilgrims visiting
                    Rome. Besides giving the routes for the principal churches and cemeteries, they
                    mention ancient buildings and give current legends regarding them. The earliest
                    is the <hi rend="italic">Itinerary of Einsiedeln,</hi> a. MS., of the 8th
                    century preserved in the monastery of Einsiedeln in Switzerland (see C. Huelsen,
                        <hi rend="italic">L' Itinerario di Einsiedeln,</hi> 1908). In the 12th
                    century was compiled the <hi rend="italic">Mirabilia urbis Romae,</hi> which
                    became the foundation of later guide-books. The last recension is contained in a
                    MS. of the early 15th century. These and other medieval documents afe printed in
                    Urlichs’ <hi rend="italic">Codex Topographicus urbis Romae</hi> (1871). The <hi

                    also to the 12th century, and was perhaps written by the author of the <hi

                    (ed. Duchesne, Paris, 1886; ed. Mommsen, in. <hi rend="italic">Monumenta
                        Germaniae historica,</hi> vol. i.), which gives the biographies of the early
                    popes and was continued throughout the middle ages, is of value as illustrating
                    the transition from pagan to Christian Rome.</p>               <p>Several early views and plans of Rome exist, beginning with the painting by
                    Cimabue in the upper church of S. Francesco at Assisi (1275). A collection of
                    these was published by De Rossi, <hi rend="italic">Piante icnografiche e
                        prospettiche di Roma anteriori al secolo XVI.</hi> (1879). Many others have
                    since come to light. (See Huelsen in <hi rend="italic">Butt. Comm. Arch.,</hi>
                    1892, p. 38).</p>               <p>In Italian and other libraries are preserved large numbers of plans and drawings
                    from ancient remains by the architects of the 15th and later centuries, <hi
                        rend="italic">e.g.</hi> Bramantino, Fra Giocondo, the members of the
                    families of Sangallo and Peruzzi, Pirro, Ligorio, Palladio, &amp;c. These
                    are of immense value, since the monuments which they drew have to a large extent
                    been destroyed. Unfortunately they are not always trustworthy, especially those
                    of Ligorio. The drawings at Florence have been indexed by Fcrri; amongst recent
                    publications may be noted those of the <hi rend="italic">Codex
                        Escortalensis</hi> by Egger (Vienna, 1905), and of a sketch-book, probably
                    by A. Coner, in the Soane Museum by Dr Ashby, in <hi rend="italic">Papers of the
                        British School at Rome,</hi> vol. ii. (1903). Amongst the printed works of
                    the early Italian architects may be. named Palladio, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Architettura</hi> (Venice, 1542), and <hi rend="italic">Terme dei
                        Romani</hi> (London, 1732), Serlio, <hi rend="italic">Architettura</hi>
                    (Venice, 1545), and Labacco, <hi rend="italic">'Architettura ed Antichitä,</hi>
                    (Rome 1557). Engravings of ancient remains in Rome have been published in great
                    numbers since the 16th century; the most important of the earlier collections
                    are the <hi rend="italic">Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae,a</hi> series
                    extending over many years in the 16th century, and Du Perac’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Vestigj di Roma</hi> (1575). To the 18th century belong the etchings of
                    Piranesi, published in several volumes, and still reproduced from the
                    copper-plates by the Calcografia.</p>               <p>The literature of Roman topography would in itself form a large library; the
                    best bibliographical guide is Mau’.s <hi rend="italic">Katalog der Bibliothek
                        des k. deutschen archäologischen Instituts in Rom</hi> (1900). The earliest
                    modern work which can be called scientific is Flavio Biondo’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Roma instaurata,</hi> written under Eugenius IV. (1431-1447), first dated
                    edition, 1479. Biondo’s work was based on the study of ancient literary
                    authorities; he was followed in his method and results by the scholars of the
                    15th and early 16th centuries, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> Pozzo, Leo Battista
                    Alberti and Andrea Fulvio. In the 16th century the study of ancient remains took
                    its place beside that of ancient literature. Marliani, who had followed Biondo
                    in the first edition of his <hi rend="italic">Antiquae urbis Romae
                        topographia</hi> (1538), issued a second edition in 1544, which contained
                    plans and illustrations. For more than a century his book formed the foundation
                    upon which such writers as Fauno, G. F&amp;bricius, Mauro, Panvinius,
                    &amp;c., raised their works. Unfortunately the Regionary Catalogues were
                    largely interpolated during this period, and published in this form by
                    Panvinius. In 1666 Famiano Nardini's <hi rend="italic">Roma antica</hi>
                    appeared, based upon the interpolated version of the Regionary Catalogues; this
                    was productive of disastrous errors, many of which remained uncorrected until
                    our own time. Nardini was followed in the 18th century by such writers as
                    Ficoroni and Vertuti; the most important works of this period were those
                    produced by excavators such as Bianchini <hi rend="italic">(Il palazzo dei
                        Cesari,</hi> 1738), or independent students of the monuments such as Raphael
                    Fabretti <hi rend="italic">(De Columna Trajana,</hi> 1683; <hi rend="italic">De
                        Aquis et Aquaeductibus,</hi> 1680). In the 18th century Winckelmann revived
                    interest in ancient, including Roman, art (especially by his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums,</hi> 1764), and his follower, Carlo
                    Fea, inaugurated the era of systematic and scientific excavation, especially in
                    the Forum. In 1829 there was founded the international <hi rend="italic"
                        >Institute di Corrispondenza Archeologica</hi> (which in. 1874 became the
                        <hi rend="italic">Kaiserlich deutsches archäologisches Institut);</hi> in
                    1830-42 was issued the <hi rend="italic">Beschreibung der Stadt Rom,</hi> by
                    Bunsen and others, in which the grosser errors which had passed current since
                    Nardini’s time were corrected. To the same period belong the magnificently
                    illustrated works of Luigi Canina <hi rend="italic">(Indica-zione di Roma
                        antica,</hi> 1830; <hi rend="italic">Esposizione topografica,</hi> 1842; <hi
                        rend="italic">A rchi-tettura antica,</hi> 1834-44; <hi rend="italic">Toro
                        Romano,</hi> 1.845; <hi rend="italic">Edifizj di Roma antica,</hi> 1848-56),
                    the value of which is impaired by their inaccuracy and the imaginative character
                    of the restorations.</p>               <p>The books on Roman topography written in the early 19th century, such as those
                    of Antonio Nibby, still pursued the uncritical methods of Nardini; from 1830
                    onwards, however, we find a series of writers whose work shows the influence of
                    the new criticism. Such were Becker <hi rend="italic">(Topographie der Stadt
                        Rom,</hi> 1843), Sir Wm. Gell <hi rend="italic">(Rome and its Vicinity,</hi>
                    1834; rev. ed. E. H. Bunbury, 1846), Braun <hi rend="italic">(Rumen und Museen
                        Roms,</hi> 1854), Reber <hi rend="italic">(Die Ruinen Roms,</hi> 1862) and
                    T. H. Dyer <hi rend="italic">(The City of Rome,</hi> 1864).</p>               <p>Since 1861, when excavations were begun on the Palatine at the instance of
                    Napoleon III., under the direction of P. Rosa, the discovery of ancient remains
                    has made constant progress, and the results have been incorporated in a number
                    of works, of which only the most important can be named here. These are: Jordan,
                        <hi rend="italic">Topographie der Stadt Rom itn Alterthum,</hi> of. which
                    three vols. (11, I2, and II.) appeared in 1871-85, and a third (I3) was written
                    after Jordan’s death by C. Huelsen and published in 1907; Gilbert, <hi

               </p>               <p>The era of church building in Rome may be said to begin with the reign of
                    Constantine and the peace of the church. Before then Christian worship was
                    conducted with various degrees of secrecy either in private houses or in the
                    catacombs (g.ti.), according as the reigning emperor viewed the sect with
                    tolerance or dislike. The type of church which in the beginning of the 4th
                    century was adopted with certain modifications from the pagan basilica, though
                    varying much in size, had little or no variety in its general form and
                    arrangement. One fixed model was strictly adhered to for many centuries, and, in
                    spite of numberless alterations and additions, can be traced in nearly all the
                    ancient churches of Rome. It is fully described and illustrated in the article
                    Basilica.</p>               <p>The walls of these early churches were mostly built of concrete, faced with
                    brick, left structurally quite plain, and decorated only with painted stucco or
                    glass mosaics—especially (internally) in the apse and on the face of its arch,
                    and (externally) on the east or entrance wall, the top of which was often built
                    in an overhanging curve to keep off the rain. The windows were plain, with
                    semicircular arches, and were filled with pierced marble screens, or in some
                    cases with slabs of translucent alabaster; the latter was the case at S. Lorenzo
                    fuori le Mura, and examples of the former still exist in the very early church
                    formed in the rooms of some thermae on the Esquilme (possibly those of Trajan),
                    below the 6th-century church of S. Martino ai Monti. Almost the only bit of
                    external architectural ornament was the eaves cornice, frequently (as at the
                    last-named church) formed of marble cornices stolen from earlier classical
                    buildings. Internally the nave columns, with their capitals and bases, were

                    museums of fine sculptured caps and rich marble shafts of every material and
                    design. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="174"> S.
                        Lorenzo and S. Agnese fuori, S. Maria in Trastevere, Ara Coeli, and

                    thè nave had no arches, the columns supporting a horizontal entablature, as in
                    old St Peter’s, S. Clemente, and S. Maria Maggiore, but afterwards, in order to
                    widen the intercolumniation, simple round arches of narrow span were introduced,
                    thus requiring fewer columns. The roof was of the simple tie-beam and kingpost
                    construction, left open, but decorated with painting or metal plates. The floor
                    was paved either with coarse mosaic of large tesserae (as at S. Pudentiana) or
                    with slabs of marble stripped from ancient ■buildings. A later development of
                    this plan added a small apse containing an altar at the end of each aisle, as in
                    S. Maria in Cosmedin</p>               <p>and S. Pietro in Vincoli. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

               </p>               <p>The type of church above described was used as a model for by far the majority
                    of early churches not only in Rome, but also in England, France, Germany, and
                    other Western countries. Another form was, however, occasionally used in Rome,
                    which appears to have been derived from the round temple of pagan times. This is
                    a circular building, usually domed and surrounded with one or more rings of
                    pillared aisles. To this class belong the combined church and mausoleum of
                    Costanza'(see fig. 14) and that of SS. Marcellinus and Petrus, both built by
                    Constantine, the former to hold the tomb of his daughters Constantia (or
                    Con-stantina) and Helena, the latter that of his mother Helena. The latter is on
                    the Via Labicana, about 2 m. outside Rome; it is a circular domed building, now
                    known as the Torre Pignattara, from the <hi rend="italic">pignatte</hi> or
                    amphorae built into the concrete dome to lighten it. The mausoleum of S.
                    Costanza, close by S. Agnese fuori, is also domed, with circular aisle, or
                    rather ambulatory, the vault of the latter decorated with mosaic of classical
                    style (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mosaic,</hi> voi. xviii. p. 885). The red
                    porphyry sarcophagi, sculptured richly with reliefs, from these mausolea are now
                    in the Vatican. On a much larger scale is the church of S. Stefano Rotondo on
                    the Coelian, built by Pope Simplicius (468-482), with a double ring of pillared
                    aisles, the outer one of which was pulled down and a new enclosure wall built by
                    Nicholas V. Other round churches are S. Teodoro (by the Vicus Tuscus), restored
                    in the 8th century, and S. Bernardo, which</p>               <p>is one of the domed halls of Diocletian’s thermae, consecrated as a church in
                    1598.</p>               <p>Space will not allow any individual description of the very numerous and
                    important churches in Rome which are built on the basilican plan. The prin</p>               <p>cipal examples are these:—</p>               <p>S. Pudentiana, traditionally</p>               <p>the oldest in Rome, restored</p>               <p>in 398; S.

                    at the dates indicated, yet in many cases it is difficult to trace the existence
                    of the ancient walls; the alterations and additions of many centuries have
                    frequently almost wholly concealed the original structure. Except at S.
                    Clemente, the early choir, placed as shown in fig. 26, has invariably been
                    destroyed; the side walls have often been broken through by .the addition of
                    rows of chapels.; and the whole church, both within and without, has been
                    overlaid with the most incongruous architectural features in stucco or stone.
                    The open roof is usually concealed either by a wooden panelled ceiling or by a

                    however, one of great artistic activity, when an immense number of beautiful
                    works, especially in marble enriched with mosaic, were produced in Rome. This
                    revival, though on different lines, was very similar to the rather later one
                    which took place at Pisa (see Pisano), and, like that, was in great part due to
                    the great artistic talents of one family,— the Cosmati, <note anchored="true"

               <p>The first member of the family of whom we have knowledge was Lorenzo, who, with
                    his son Jacopo, made the ambones of S. Maria in Ara Coeli and an altar-canopy
                    (eiborium) in SS. Apostoli. Jacopo decorated the door of S. Saba in 1205 and,
                    together with his son Cosma (who gave his name to the family), that of.S.
                    Tommaso in Formis; the father and son worked together at Civita Castellana in
                    1210. Cosma made a eiborium for SS. Giovanni e Paolo in 1235, and worked with
                    his sons Luca and Jacopo at Anagni and Subiaco during the first half of the 13th
                    century. So far. the inscriptions enable us to trace the relationships of the
                    Cosmati with certainty; it is not so clear whether the Cosma above mentioned is
                    to be identified with the master who decorated the chapel of the Sancta
                    Sanctorum belonging to the old Latcran palace which was rebuilt by Nicholas III.
                    (1277-1280). This Cosma was, however, almost certainly the father of Giovanni,
                    the last of the family, who made the tombs of Cardinal Durand (died 1299) in S.
                    Maria sopra Minerva, Cardinal Rodríguez in S. Maria Maggiore, and Stefano de*
                    Surdi in S. Balbina. Another artist who seems to have belonged to this family,
                    Deodato, made the ciboria of S. Maria in Cosmcdin and (prohably) of S. John
                    Lateran; he is probably identical with the <hi rend="italic">Dcodatus filius
                        Cosmati</hi> who, together with another Jacopo, executed a pavement at S.
                    Jacopo alia Lungara. .A large number of other works of this school, but
                    unsigned, exist in Rome. These are mainly altars and baldacchini, choir-screens,
                    paschal candlesticks, ambones, tombs, and the like, all enriched with sculpture
                    and glass mosaic of great brilliance and decorative effect.</p>               <p>Besides the more mechanical sort of work, such as mosaic patterns and
                    architectural decoration, they also produced mosaic pictures and sculpture of
                    very high merit, especially the recumbent effigies, with angels standing at the
                    head and foot, in the tombs of Ara Coeli, S. Maria Maggiore, and elsewhere. One
                    of their finest works is in S. Cesáreo; this is a marble altar richly decorated
                    with mosaic in sculptured panels, and (below) two angels drawing back a curtain
                    (all in marble) so as to expose the open grating of the confessio.</p>               <p>Besides the Cosmati, other artists, such as Paulus Romanus and his sons in the
                    12th century, and Petrus Vassallectus in the 13th, contributed to the revival of
                    art. The beautiful cloisters of S. Paolo fuori le Mura, begun by “ Magister
                    Petrus,” and those of S. John Lateran, the work of Vassallectus, are the finest
                    architectural works of this school. In the latter part of the 13th century we
                    find the sculptor Arnolfo del Cambio at work in Rome. His altar-canopy at S.
                    Paolo fuori le Mura (1285) seems to have been imitated by the Cosmati in their
                    latest works; his tomb of Cardinal de Braye (d. 1282) at Orvieto also shows his
                    intimate connexion with that school. Another artist of the same period, Petrus
                    Oderisius, worked in England; the shrine of the Confessor at Westminster (1269)
                    was made by him.</p>               <p>The earlier works of the Cosmati are Romanesque in style, but in the 13th
                    century Gothic elements were introduced, especially in the elaborate
                    altar-canopies., with their geometrical tracery. In detail, however, they differ
                    widely from the purer Gothic of northern countries. The richness of effect which
                    the English or French architect obtained by elaborate and carefully worked
                    mouldings was produced in Italy by the beauty of polished marbles and jewellike
                    mosaics,—the details being mostly rather coarse and often carelessly executed.</p>               <p>Chiefly to the 13th century belong the large number of beautiful campanili,
                    which are the most conspicuous relics of the medieval period in Rome. The finest
                    of these are attached to the churches of S. Francesca Romana, SS. Giovanni e
                    Paolo, and S. Maria Maggiore. Others belong to the basilicas of S. Lorenzo fuori
                    and S. Croce in Geru-salemme, and to S. Giorgio in Velabro, S. Maria in
                    Cosmedin, S. Alessio, S. Giovanni ad Portam Latinam, S. Cecilia, S. Crisogono,
                    and S. Pudentiana. They occupy various positions with regard to the church,
                    being all later additions; that of SS. Giovanni e Paolo stands at some distance
                    from it. In design they are very similar, consisting of many stages, divided by
                    brick and marble cornices; in the upper storeys are from two to four windows on
                    each side, with round arches supported on slender marble columns. They are
                    decorated with brilliantly coloured <hi rend="italic">ciotole</hi> or disks of
                    earthenware, enamelled and painted in green or turquoise blue, among the
                    earliest existing specimens of the so-called majolica (see Ceramics). Sometimes
                    disks or crosses made of red or green porphyry are inlaid in the walls. In most
                    cases on one face of the top storey is a projecting canopied niche, which once
                    contained a statue or mosaic picture. The walls are built of fine neat
                    brickwork. The largest and once the handsomest of all, that of S. Maria
                    Maggiore, has string-courses of enamelled and coloured terra-cotta. <note

                    usually formed of large marble slabs with trefoilshaped heads or cusped arches.
                    As a rule the upper storeys projected slightly over the lower wall, and were
                    supported on small ornamental machicolations. The top storey frequently had an
                    open loggia, with rows of pointed arches. When vaulting was used it also was of
                    the pointed form, usually in simple quadripartite bays, with slightly moulded
                    groin-ribs. The finest existing specimen of this style is the palace built about
                    1300 by Boniface VIII. (Benedetto Gaetani), enclosing the tomb of Cecilia
                    Metella on the Via Appia, with a graceful little chapel within the precincts of
                    the castle. This building is well worthy of study; the remaining part is well
                    preserved. Many houses of this period, though generally much injured by
                    alterations, still exist in Rome. They are mostly in out-of-the-way alleys, and,
                    mot being mentioned in any books, are seldom examined. The Ghetto (now
                    destroyed) and the quarter near the Ponte Rotto contained many of these
                    interesting buildings, as well as some of the most crowded parts of the
                    Trastevere district, but most have disappeared owing to the wholesale
                    destruction of old streets. Among those which may possibly escape for a while is
                    the 13th-century house where Giulio Romano lived, near the Palazzo di Venezia,
                    and the Albergo del Orso, at the end of the Via di Tordinona, of the same
                    period, which was an inn in the 16th century and is one still; this has remains
                    of a fine upper loggia, with rich cornices in moulded terra-cotta; the lowest
                    storey has pointed vaulting resting on many pillars. Another graceful but less
                    stately house exists, though sadly mutilated, opposite the entrance to the
                    atrium of S. Cecilia in Trastevere. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        architectural decorations are an extraordinary mixture of marble fragments
                        of the most miscellaneous sort, all taken from classical buildings ; it has
                        an inscription over the doorway, from which we learn that it was the

                    once numerous lofty towers built by the turbulent Roman barons for purposes of
                    defence. The finest, the Torre delle Milizie on the Viminal, was built in the
                    13th century by the sons of Petrus Alexius; of about the same date is the Torre
                    dei Conti, near the forum of Augustus, built by Marchione of Arezzo; both these
                    were once much higher than they are now; they are very simple and noble in
                    design, with massive walls faced with neat brickwork.</p>               <p>Till the 14th century the Lateran was the usual residence of the pope; this was
                    once a very extensive building, covering four times its present area. The
                    original house is said to have belonged to the senator Plautius Lateranus in the
                    reign of Nero; but the existing part on the line of the Aurelian wall is of the
                    3rd century. This house, which had become the property of the emperors, was
                    given by Constantine as a residence for S. Sylvester; it was very much enlarged
                    at many periods during the next ten centuries; in 1308 a great part was burnt,
                    and in 1586 the ancient palace was completely destroyed by Sixtus V., and the
                    present palace built by Domenico Fontana. The Cappella Sancta Sanctorum (see
                    list of Cosmati works) is the only relic of the older palace. <note

                    Avignon in 1377. In 1415 John XXIII. connected the Vatican and the castle of S.
                    Angelo by a covered passage carried on arches. But little of the existing palace
                    is older than the 15th century; Nicholas V. in 1447 began its reconstruction on
                    a magnificenj scale, and this was carried on by Sixtus IV. (Sistine chapel),
                    Alexander VI. (Torre Borgia), Julius II. and Leo X. (Bramante’s cortile and
                    Raphael’s Loggie and Stanze), and Paul III. (Saia Regia and Cappella Paolina by
                    Antonio da Sangallo). Sixtus V. and his successors built the lofty part of the
                    palace on the east of Bramante’s cortile. The Scala Regia was built by Bernini
                    for Urban VIII. and Alexander VII., the Museo Pio-Clementino under Clement XIV.
                    and Pius VI., the Braccio Nuovo under Pius VII., and lastly the grand stairs</p>               <p>up to the cortile were added by Pius IX. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    architectural merit. It stands on the highest part of the hill, near the site of
                    the baths of Constantine. This palace was begun in 1574, under Gregory XIII., by
                    Flaminio Ponzio, and was completed by Fontana</p>               <p>and Madcrna under subsequent popes.</p>               <p>The only important church in Rome which is wholly Gothic in style is S. Maria
                    sopra Minerva, the chief church of the Dominican order. This was not the work of
                    a Roman architect, but was designed by two Dominican friars from Florence—Fra
                    Ristori and Fra Sisto—about 1289, who were also the architects of their own
                    church of S. Maria Novella. It much resembles the contemporary churches of the
                    same order in Florence, having wide-spanned pointed arches on clustered piers
                    and simple quadripartite vaulting. Its details resemble the early French in
                    character. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="186"> The
                        absence of a triforium is one. of the chief reasons why the large Gothic
                        churches of Italy are so inferior in effect to the cathedrals of France and
                        England. </note> It contains a large number of fine tombs; among them that
                    of Durandus, bishop of Mende (the author of the celebrated <hi rend="italic"
                        >Rationale divinorum officiorum),</hi> by Giovanni Cosma, c. 1300, and the
                    tomb of Fra Angelico, the great Dominican painter, who died in Rome, 1455. The
                    most elaborate specimen of - ecclesiastical Gothic in Rome is that part of S.
                    Maria in Ara Coeli which was rebuilt about 1300, probably by one of the Cosmati,
                    namely, the south aisle and transept. During the 14th century (chiefly owing to
                    the absence of the popes at Avignon) the arts were neglected at Rome, and a
                    period of decadence set in. The sculptured effigy and reredos of Cardinal
                    d’Alençon (d. 1403) in S. Maria in Trastevere, executed by a certain Paulus
                    Romanus, is a fair example of the works produced during this period ; the effigy
                    is a very clumsy and feeble copy of the</p>               <p>fine recumbent figures of the Cosmati.</p>               <p>                   <hi rend="italic">Florentine Period, c. 1450-1550.</hi>
               </p>               <p>The long period of almost complete artistic inactivity in Rome was broken in the
                    15th century by the introduction of a number of foreign artists, chiefly
                    Florentines, who during this and the succeeding century enriched Rome with an
                    immense number of magnificent works of art. The dawn of this brilliant epoch may
                    be said to have begun with the arrival of Fra Angelico (see Fiesole) in 1447,
                    invited by Nicholas V. to paint the walls of his small private chapel in the
                    Vatican dedicated to S. Lorenzo.</p>               <p>In the latter half of the 15th century a large number of sculptured tombs (as
                    well as tabernacles, altar frontals, reredoses and the like) were made for Roman
                    churches by sculptors from Tuscany and north Italy. The earliest of these tombs
                    is that of Eugenius IV. (d. 1447) in S. Salvatore in Lauro, by Isaia da Pisa. It
                    presents the typical form of a life-sized recumbent effigy resting on a richly
                    ornamented sarcophagus over which is a canopy decorated with reliefs and
                    statuettes. The type was brought to perfection by the Florentine Mino da Fiesole
                    (see Mino di Giovanni),</p>               <p>who worked in Rome under Pius II. and succeeding popes, being assisted in some
                    cases by another artist of almost equal skill, Giovanni Dalmata. A Lombard
                    sculptor, Andrea Bregno, came to Rome under Paul If. and worked there until the
                    closing years of the century; his tomb is in S. Maria Sopra Minerva. The works
                    of these artists and their followers are to be found in a great number of
                    churches, notably S. Maria del Popolo. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    were carried out by another Florentine, Giuliano da Majano. The Palazzo di
                    Venezia, begun for Cardinal Barbo, afterwards Paul II., about 1455, a very
                    massive and stately building of medieval character, was built by Giuhano da

                    seen. He combined the delicacy of detail and the graceful lightness of the
                    Gothic style with the measured stateliness and rhythmical proportions of classic
                    architecture. Though he invariably used the round arch and took his mouldings
                    from antique sources, his beautiful cloisters and loggie are Gothic in their
                    general conception. Moreover, he never committed the prevalent blunder, of the
                    16th century, which was a fruitless attempt to obtain magnificence by mere size
                    in a building, without multiplying its parts. Hisprincipal works in Rome are the
                    Palazzo della Cancelleria, built for Cardinal Riario (1495-1505), with its
                    stately church of S. Lorenzo in Damaso; the so-called Palazzo di Bramante in the
                    Governo Vecchio, built in 1500; and the Palazzo Giraud, near St Peter’s, once
                    the residence of Cardinal Wolsey,* built in 1503. He also built the cortile of
                    S. Damaso in the Vatican, the toy-like tempietto in the cloister of S. Pietro in
                    Montorio (1502), and the cloisters of S. Maria della Pace (1504). <note

                    made complete designs for it, with -a plan in the form of a Greek cross. The
                    piers and arches of the central dome were the only parts completed at the time
                    of his death in 1514, and subsequent architects did not carry out his design.

                    art, and in the succeeding century produced so much that is almost brutal in its
                    coarseness and neglect of all true canons of proportion and scale. During the
                    earlier stage, however, of this decadence, and throughout the 16th century, a
                    large number of fine palaces and churches were built in and near Rome by various

                    the abandonment of classical models. The works of Michelangelo were too grand to
                    be accused of exceeding the extreme limits of good taste, but his scholars and

               <p>which had its cradle in Rome, was soon adopted throughout Italy. Vignola
                    (1507-1573) had done his best to bind the art of building to strictly classic
                    rules, but in spite of his efforts the degeneration made progress during his own

                    relief and shadow, and such a wonderful combination of variety and solidity as
                    cannot fail to please the many, even now, by the magnificence of their general
                    effect. In Rome, the numerous works of Bernini, Borromini, Maderna, Rainaldi,
                    Salvi, Fuga, Longhi and others bear witness to the gifted activity of Italian
                    architects during that period; if genius necessarily creates, those men showed
                    more of it than their predecessors who adhered to the classic and revered the
                    teachings of Vitruvius. Degeneration is tolerated and sometimes even pleases,
                    under the name of transformation, but there is nothing to be said for the real
                    decay which marks the 18th century. It was not universal at first, for it is by
                    nature a slow process; such men as A. Galilei, Specchi, Peparelli, Marchionni,
                    Morelli, Camporese and Piranesi left works not altogether without value; but the
                    outrageous abuse of ornament increased with every year, and was made more and
                    more evident by the clumsy heaviness of the pillars and pilasters that supported
                    the whole. The refined purity of the Renaissance disappeared as completely as
                    the delicate grace and exquisite ornamentation of the Cosmatesque period. Many
                    works of the greatest beauty were destroyed outright, and many more were
                    disfigured and often wholly hidden by horrible stucco constructions and
                    decorations; or, on a larger scale, by the application of hideous stone façades
                    to churches of which the simple good taste had delighted generations of mankind.
                    The deformation of the noble old Lateran basilica is a conspicuous instance of
                    such deeds; another is Santa Maria Maggiore, and the false fronts plastered upon
                    San Marcello and Santa Maria in Via Lata, both in the Corso, give a very clear
                    idea of what was generally done. The interiors of old churches suffered quite as
                    much, and even the frescoes of early masters were not spared; those by
                    Pinturicchio in the third chapel (south) of S. Maria del Popolo were covered
                    with wretched stucco ornaments, only removed in 1850, and numberless works of
                    art by Giotto and other early painters were wilfully destroyed.</p>               <p>The decline of architecture continued in the 19th century, notwithstanding the
                    laudable efforts of Valadier and a few other painstaking imitators, who produced
                    the so-called “ academic neo-classic” reaction; among them may be noted the
                    names of Canina, Poletti, Sarti and Azzurri. The futility of their works invited
                    the feeble eclecticism which soon afterwards became so general that the
                    architecture of the period is wholly without individuality, good • or bad. The
                    chief architectural work of the 19th century was the rebuilding of the great
                    basilica of S. Paolo fuori le Mura, burnt in 1823, in a style of cold splendour
                    which is anything but devotional in its general effect. The pillars are huge
                    monoliths of grey granite from the Alps; the confessio and transepts are lined
                    with rosso and verde antico from quarries then recently rediscovered in Greece,
                    and with Egyptian alabaster and lapis lazuli and malachite adorn the bases of
                    the columns round the high altar in lavish profusion. Thirty years were required
                    for the rebuilding of the frigidly magnificent edifice, which was reconsecrated
                    in 1854. The east façade displays a quantity of gaudy mosaics, and the projected
                    quadriportico is wanting. The belfry is nothing but a steeple, and has an
                    unfortunate resemblance to a lighthouse. In extenuation of the result it must be
                    admitted that the original building had been totally destroyed by fire, but no
                    such excuse can be found for the barbarous assault on Christian art which was
                    perpetrated by Francesco Vespignani in the extension of the Lateran basilica.</p>               <p>This work was begun under Pius IX. and finished under Leo XIII.; it involved the
                    destruction of the ancient tribune and its ambulatory, the only parts of the
                    church which had so far escaped complete disfigurement, and the priceless
                    mosaics (1290), among the most beautiful in Rome, were taken down and replaced
                    in the new apse in a sadly mutilated and restored form. (For the interesting
                    discoveries made in excavating for the new foundations, see <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ann. 1st.</hi> 1877»P-332.)</p>               <p>The Vatican contains the largest collection in the world of Greco-</p>               <p>Roman and Roman sculpture, with a few specimens of true Hellenic art. It is also
                    very rich in Greek vases and in objects from Etruscan tombs; this latter
                    division is called the Musco Gregoriano. There is also an Egyptian museum which
                    contains a few important curiosities. In the great library arc preserved a
                    number of early glass chalices and other rare objects from the catacombs, as
                    well as many fine specimens of later Christian art—church plate and jewels. The
                    picture gallery, though not as large as some of the private collections in Rome,
                    contains few inferior pictures. The Lateran palace, still, like the Vatican, in
                    the possession of the pope, contains a fine collection of classical sculpture,
                    but is most remarkable as a museum of Christian antiquities. The two capitoline
                    museums are very rich in classical sculpture, bronzes, coins, pottery and the
                    contents of early Etruscan and Latin tombs. A large hall has been added, and is
                    filled with sculptures found in Rome since 1870, of which the arrangement was
                    completed on the occasion of King Edward VII.’s visit. The picture gallery
                    contains a few masterpieces and a large number of inferior works. The new Museo
                    delle Terme has been formed in the great cloister of S. Maria degli Angelí, to
                    hold the numerous fine examples of classical, painting and sculpture found along
                    the Tiber during the excavations for the new embankment, and in other places in
                    Rome. The university of Rome possesses fine collections of minerals, fossils and
                    other geological specimens, and examples of ancient marbles used in the
                    buildings of Rome. A Museo Artístico Industríale has been formed in a monastery
                    in the Capo le Case, to contain medieval works of art. It is, however, a matter
                    for regret that the few medieval works which Rome possesses should be scattered
                    in three small collections, namely, the one last mentioned, the Capitol and the
                    Castle of S. Angelo, where an attempt is being made to form a real medieval
                    museum; many objects, too, are dispersed throughout the city, and will doubtless
                    disappear unless they are better protected. . The Museo Kircheriano contains an
                    unrivalled collection of prehistoric objects of stone, bronze, iron and pottery,
                    found in Italy and the Italian islands, and more particularly a number of
                    ancient Latian urns, <hi rend="italic">capanne</hi> and the like. The collection
                    of <hi rend="italic">aes grave</hi> is the finest yet made; and the museum, also
                    contains a large quantity of interesting classical antiquities of various kinds.
                    Another branch is the Ethnological Museum. Unfortunately all these museums are
                    badly adapted for purposes of study, being neither well arranged nor well
                    catalogued. The Musco Baraccó, presented to the city in 1905 by the senator of
                    that name, contains some ancient sculptures of great value. The Museum of
                    Etruscan and Faliscan antiquities in the Villa Giulia, near Porta del Popolo, is
                    of considerable importance, as is also the Borgia Museum in the Propaganda
                    palace, the latter for its ancient geographical curiosities.. The museum of
                    plaster casts in the Tcstaccio quarter contains reproductions of the principal
                    ancient sculptures possessed by foreign museums.</p>               <p>. Among the private collections of pictures the Borghcse is unrivalled. The next
                    in importance is that in the Doria palace, which, however, like most Italian
                    collections, contains a large proportion of very inferior works. The Corsini
                    picture gallery, bought by the government, is chiefly rich in tne works of the
                    Bolognese and other third-rate painters, but also possesses a fine collection of
                    engravings and etchings. There are a few fine paintings in the Barberini palace,
                    but the Sciarra gallery no longer exists. There are some good pictures by
                    Raphael and Guido Reni in the Academy of St Luke; the Galleria d’Arte Moderna is
                    a collection of modern paintings acquired by the government.</p>               <p>The. largest private collection of sculpture is that of the Villa</p>               <p>Albani, which, among a large mass of inferior Roman sculpture, contains a few
                    gems of Greek art. The original Albani collection was stolen and brought to
                    Paris by Napoleon I., and was there dispersed; one relief, the celebrated
                    Antinous, is the only piece of sculpture from the original collection which was
                    sent back from Paris. This is in the collection of Prince Torlonia, which
                    contains several.very fine works, but unfortunately the greater number are much
                    injured and falsified by restorations. The casino in the Borghcse gardens
                    possesses a great quantity of sculpture, mostly third-rate Roman works, the most
                    important of which, however, are executed in precious marbles. The small
                    collection which formerly existed in the Villa Ludovici has been bought by . the
                    government and removed to the Museo delle Tcrmc; it contained a few works of
                    Greek sculpture of great value, the most important being the Pergamean group
                    representing the suicide of a Gaulish chief, a Medusa’s head in relief and a
                    male terminal figure. The</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0613" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0658.jp2"/>

                    private residences, such as the Colonna palace, still contain collections of

                    former library of the Barberini. Mention must also be made of the Corsiniana,
                    now belonging to the Accademia dei Lincei. The Biblioteca Sarti, beside the
                    Academy of S. Luke, contains works on art.</p>               <p>                   <hi rend="smallcaps">The Modern City</hi>
               </p>               <p>Great changes in the municipal and social conditions of Rome followed the
                    occupation of the city by the Italians (20th September 1870), and the rapid
                    increase of population due to immigration from other parts of Italy. It is a
                    mistake, however, to attribute all the works undertaken and executed since 1870
                    to the initiative of the new government. The first plan for modernizing and
                    improving Rome was that of Pope Julius II., who aimed at the enlargement of the
                    lower city on both sides of the Tiber. The modern Via Giuba shows in part what
                    he meant to do. Following him, Sixtus V. did his best to develop the upper part
                    of the city by laying out the Via Sistina, from the Trinità dei Monti to S.
                    Maria Maggiore and Porta S. Giovanni. Almost in our own time a plan for the
                    improvement of the city was made, under the direction of Mgr. de Merode, during
                    the reign of Pius IX.; and although but a small portion of the projected changes
                    were carried out under the pope, the general scheme was in most respects
                    satisfactory, and proved a good foundation for further extensive developments.
                    He was able to complete the construction of the beautiful ascent to S. Pietro in
                    Montorio, as well as that which leads up to the Quirinal Palace; and the Via
                    Nazionale, which was to have been called Via De Merode, was also begun. His plan
                    did not include, however, the destruction of villas such as the Lu dovisi, nor
                    the wholesale removal of trees, which is so greatly to be deplored. These acts
                    of barbarism were the consequences of the reckless speculations in land and
                    buildings that accompanied and followed the active and excellent ^vork done by
                    the municipality, and might bave been checked by vigorous and timely action of
                    the government. As it was, a number of the most important Roman families were
                    ruined. At the outset, and as soon as‘political circumstances admitted the
                    consideration of such matters, the municipality set to work; and though a
                    comprehensible love of the picturesque has caused many persons to regret the
                    result, altogether or in part, it is not to be denied that the improvements
                    carried out have been of the highest advantage to the city, and that the work is
                    in many instances of creditable solidity,</p>               <p>Two principal problems presented themselves. The more important was the
                    confinement of the Tiber in such a manner as to render impossible the serious
                    floods which had from time to time inundated the city, often causing great
                    damage to property and rendering the lower streets more or less impassable.
                    There were floods which almost reached the level of the first storey near San
                    Carlo in the Corso, and it was common to see the great Piazza Navona and the
                    neighbourhood of the Pantheon full of water for days together during the winter.
                    The interruption of traffic can be imagined, and the damage to property was
                    serious. The other urgent matter was one of which the government of Pius IX. had
                    been partially aware, namely, the necessity for opening better thoroughfares
                    between different parts of the city. In the middle ages the population of Rome
                    had dwindled to twenty or thirty thousand inhabitants, who lived huddled
                    together about the strongholds of the barons, and the modem city had slowly
                    grown again upon the exiguous foundation of a medieval town. The need for
                    changing this condition of things, which had been felt under Pius IX., became
                    overwhelmingly apparent as the population rapidly increased. That which under a
                    continuance of the old government might have been done by degrees during a long
                    period, had to be accomplished in the shortest possible time, with means which,
                    though considerable, were far from adequate, and in the face of opposition by
                    many holders of real estate, the most important of whom were conservatively
                    attached to the papal government, and resisted change for no other reason. In
                    what was now done it is necessary to distinguish clearly between the work
                    undertaken and carried out by the municipality, under considerable pressure of
                    circumstances, and that which was done in the way of private speculation. The
                    first was on the whole good, and has proved enduring; the second was in many
                    cases bad, and resulted in great loss. As soon as the opening of such streets as
                    the Via Nazionale and the Via Cavour, the widening and straightening of the Via
                    dell’ Angelo Custode, now the Via del Tritone Nuovo, and similar improvements,
                    such as the con- * struction of new bridges over the Tiber, had demonstrated
                    that the value of property could be doubled and quadrupled in a . short time,
                    and as soon as the increase of population had caused a general rise in rents,
                    owners of property awoke to the situation of affairs, and became as anxious as
                    they had at first been disinclined to improve their estates by wholesale
                    building.</p>               <p>The most important and expensive work executed by the government with the
                    assistance of the municipality was the construction of the embankments along the
                    Tiber. Though damaged by the great flood of December 1900, their truly Roman
                    solidity saved the city from the disastrous consequences of a wide inundation.
                    It is impossible not to admire them, and not to feel respect for a people able
                    to carry out such a plan in such a manner and in so short a time, in the face of
                    such great difficulties. But so far as the life of the city was concerned, the
                    cutting of new streets and the widening of old ones produced a more apparent
                    immediate result. The opening of such a thoroughfare as the Via Nazionale could
                    not but prove to be of the greatest value. It begins at the Piazza delle Terme,
                    in which the principal railway station is situated, and connects the upper part
                    of the city by a broad straight road, and then, by easy gradients, with the
                    Forum of Trajan, the Piazza dei Santi Apostoli and the Piazza di Venezia,
                    whence, as the Corso Vittorio Emanuele, it runs through the heart of the old
                    city, being designed to reach St Peter’s by a new bridge of the same name, near
                    the bridge of S. Angelo. It is true that, in order to accomplish this, the Villa
                    Aldobrandini had to be partially destroyed, but this is almost the only point
                    which lovers of beauty can regret, and in compensation it opened to full view
                    the famous palace of the Massimo family, the imposing church of S. Andrea della
                    Valle, and the noble pile of the Cancelleria, one of the best pieces of
                    architecture in Rome. Another great artery is the Via Cavour, which was intended
                    to connect the railway station with the south-western part of Rome, descending
                    to the Forum, and thence turning northwards to reach the Piazza di Venezia on
                    the east side of the monument to Victor Emanuel II. These are only examples of
                    what was done, for it would be impossible to give a just idea of the
                    transformation of the city. Rome is now divided clearly into two parts, the old
                    and the new, of which the old is incomparably the more artistic and the more
                    beautiful, as it will always remain the more interesting. Among the works
                    carried out by the government and municipality the fine tunnel under the
                    Quirinal Hill (completed in 1002) deserves mention; it forms a connecting
                    channel for the traffic between the streets at the north end of the old city,
                    the Corso, Babuino, &amp;c., and the upper part of Rome, including the Via
                    Nazionale and the Esquiline. Another difficult undertaking, successfully
                    completed in April 1908, was the construction of the enormous causeway and
                    bridge which now unite the Pincio with the Villa Borghese, or, as it is now
                    called, the Villa Umberto Primo, to the immense advantage of the public. In the
                    same year the building for the new law courts was finished; it stands near S.
                    Angelo, and presents, on the whole, an imposing appearance, though overloaded
                    with clumsy stone ornamentation.</p>               <p>It is unnecessary to mention a number of public buildings and government offices
                    which have little architectural merit, but w*e cannot overlook such a
                    magnificent group of buildings devoted to scientific purposes as the
                    Policlinico, on the Macas, which is admittedly one of the finest hospitals in
                    Europe, and the military</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0614" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0659.jp2"/>
               <p>hospital on the Coelian. The rebuilding of the Palazzo del Parlamento is only
                    second to the enormous monument of Victor Emanuel II. The majority of the
                    buildings erected by individuals and corporations since 1870 present no original
                    or characteristic features, and the best of them are copies or imitations of
                    well-known models. The Cassa del Risparmio, in the Corso, reproduces a
                    Florentine palace; the Palazzo Negroni, near the Piazza Nicotia, is modelled on
                    the Cancelleria and the Palazzo Giraud; many of the large residences in the new
                    quarters beyond the Tiber arc fairly good copies of palaces in the Florentine
                    style, though the magnificent carved stone of earlier centuries is
                    disadvantageous^ replaced by stucco, a material 5vhich lasts tolerably well in
                    the mild climate of Rome. Opposite the beautiful and severe Palazzo di Venezia,
                    what might have been a faultless reproduction of it is marred by tasteless
                    ornament. Finally, so far as the construction of new streets is concerned, which
                    lovers of the picturesque so greatly deplore, it must be admitted that they have
                    been rendered necessary by the great increase of traffic and population, and it
                    should be remembered that after the 16th century the wisest of the popes did
                    their best to open up the city by widening and straightening the thoroughfares.</p>               <p>                   <hi rend="italic">Municipal Administration.—</hi> After the taking of Rome,
                    those persons who remained loyal to Pius IX. took no part whatever in public
                    affairs, and the municipal administration was entirely in the hands of the
                    monarchists. The expression <hi rend="sup">a</hi> ne eletti n£ elettori,”
                    meaning that Catholics are to be neither voters nor candidates, which came to be
                    regarded as a sort of rule of the party, was invented at that time by an
                    epigrammatic journalist, and it seems at first to have been applied also to
                    municipal matters, whereas it was later understood to refer only to
                    parliamentary elections. Leo XIII. encouraged the formation of a Catholic party
                    in the municipal administration, and the municipal government drifted largely
                    into the hands of Catholics, though circumstances make it necessary that the
                    Syndic (Mayor) should always be a royalist. Between 1870 and the end of the
                    century the socialist party had no great influence in Rome, which can never be a
                    city of manufacturing interests. For purposes of municipal government the
                    division of the city into districts has been modified, but the old division into
                    fourteen <hi rend="italic">rioni</hi> is adhered to in principle, the new
                    quarters of Castro Pretorio and the Esquiline having been included in the first
                    Rione, which still bears the name of “ Monti.” The municipality consists of a
                    mayor and eighty communal councillors, of whom a large proportion were for many
                    years members of the aristocracy. Later, however, the three democratic parties,
                    known as the monarchist, socialist and republican, united to form a popular
                    coalition, and succeeded in completely excluding the conservative, aristocratic
                    and Catholic elements.</p>               <p>                   <hi rend="italic">Poprdation.—</hi> The population in 1870 was 226,022, as
                    against 462,743 in 1901 (communal population). It therefore more than doubled in
                    thirty years. The increase, however, did not take place at a regular rate, owing
                    to the changes in the rates of immigration and emigration. The largest increase
                    was in 1870, reaching 22,186; the next most important in 1884, 1885, 1886, 1887,
                    in which years it constantly remained near 20,000. The least increase in later
                    years was 4417 in 1891. The garrison of Rome is about 10,000 men. Careful
                    inquiry has placed it beyond doubt that there are in Rome aboqt the same number
                    of ecclesiastics of all orders, including about 1500 students in the theological
                    seminaries. The average birth-rate is lower in Rome than in the majority of
                    great cities. The number of births increased after 1870 very nearly in
                    proportion with the increase of population.</p>               <p>                   <hi rend="italic">Climate and Hygiene.—</hi> The climate of Rome is mild and
                    sunny, but the variation in temperature between day and night is very great.
                    December and February appear to be the coldest months, the thermometer then
                    averaging 47° F.; the greatest heat, which averages 75°, is felt in July and
                    August. The surrounding Campagna is still not all habitable during the summer,
                    though the dangerous malaria has been checked by the planting of numerous
                    eucalyptus trees. A remarkable instance of the effect produced upon the marshy
                    soil by these plantations may be studied at the Trappist monastery of the Tre
                    Fontane, situated on the Via Ardcatina, about 4 m. from Rome. Whereas in former
                    times it was almost always fatal to spend the whole summer there, the monks have
                    so far dried the soil by means of the eucalyptus that they reside in the
                    monastery throughout the year. The municipality has everywhere made strenuous
                    efforts to reduce the mortality due to malaria; in 1890, 14% of all the deaths
                    in Rome and the Campagna were attributed to this cause; in 1905 the proportion
                    had dropped to 3%. Very large sums have been expended in a scientific system of
                    drainage and sub-drainage on both sides of the Tiber, and the use of wire gauze
                    mosquito nets for the doors and windows of the humblest habitations in the
                    Campagna has contributed much to the present satisfactory result. The hygienic
                    conditions of Rome itself have greatly improved, largely through the ceaseless
                    efforts of Commendatore Baccelli, a distinguished man of science, who repeatedly
                    held office in the Italian Ministry. The publication of exceedingly accurate
                    graphic tables in February 1900 shows the following facts. Ninety per 1000
                    deaths occurred in 1871 from typhoid (the so-called “ Roman fever ”), and the
                    average has now fallen to a low constant. Deaths from small-pox, formerly of
                    alarming frequency, can be said not to occur at all, and their numbers
                    diminished suddenly after the introduction of compulsory vaccination..</p>               <p>                   <hi rend="italic">Charities and Education.—</hi> A great number of small
                    charitable institutions for children and old people have been founded, which are
                    organized on the most modern principles, and in many of these charitable persons
                    of the upper classes give their individual assistance to the poor. There are
                    also private hospitals for diseases of the eye, in which poor patients are
                    lodged and treated without payment. There are two hospitals entirely maintained
                    by private resources, where infants are treated whose mothers fear to send them
                    to a public hospital, or in cases refused by the latter as not being serious
                    enough for admission. Of course, the numbers of the poor greatly increased with
                    the growth of population, especially after the failure of building speculations
                    between 1888 and 1890, though great efforts were made by the municipality to
                    send all persons then thrown out of employment back to their homes. One of the
                    difficulties under which Rome labours is that w'hile it attracts the population
                    of the country, as other capitals do, it possesses no great mechanical
                    industries in which the newcomers can be employed. Efforts to create small
                    industries in the populous quarters of the poor met with little success. Before
                    1870 a society was formed, which lias since greatly developed as an intelligent
                    private enterprise, to provide the poor with sanitary tenements; but its
                    success.is much hampered by the absence of employment, which again is partly due
                    to the heavy taxation of small industries. A number of trade schools are also
                    maintained by private funds, such as the Instituto degli Artigianelli, managed
                    by the Fratelli della Dottrina Cristiana, and the Ricovero pei Fanciulli
                    Abbandonati (home for friendless children), which is under lay management and
                    has flourishing workshops. The character of official charities has certainly
                    improved in principle, so far as their educational and moral scope are concerned
                    ; for whereas in former times the limited number of the poor made individual and
                    almost paternal relief possible, that form of charity had a pauperizing
                    influence. If anything, the present tendency is to go too far in the opposite
                    direction, and to require too many formalities before any relief is granted; and
                    while the union of the principal charities under a central management on
                    advanced theories improved the methods of administration, it destroyed numerous
                    small sources of immediate relief on which the poor had a traditional right to
                    count, and was in that way productive of hardship. At the same time, however,
                    mutual benefit societies <hi rend="italic">{società di mutuo soccorso)</hi> have
                    been organized in great numbers by the different crafts and professions, and are
                    chiefly distinguishable by the political parties to which they belong. It is
                    characteristic of the modern Roman people that the most widely different
                    elements subsist without showing any signs of amalgamating, yet without
                    attacking each other. Some of these societies have an exclusively clerical
                    character, others are merely conservative, some consist of monarchists, and some
                    of avowed republicans.</p>               <p>Popular educat ion.is principally in the hands of the municipality, but besides
                    the public schools there are numerous religious institutions attended by the
                    children of the lower classes; they follow the curriculum prese rii led by the
                    government, and are under the constant supervision of municipal inspectors, both
                    as regards their teaching and their hygiene. The pope also expends large sums in
                    the maintenance of the people’s schools, managed entirely by laymen, and also
                    under government inspection. For education of the higher grade, besides the
                    regular lyceums and gymnasiums, there are many private schools similarly
                    designated from which pupils can present themselves for the regular government
                    examinations,</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0615" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0660.jp2"/>

                    classes were divided into hostile factions, each of which maintained a press of
                    its own and rallied round representative individuals. So far as the middle
                    classes were concerned, the common interest of commercial operations soon
                    concentrated political differences. The aristocracy, however, kept rigidly aloof
                    from all speculations for a time, and maintained its traditional attitude of
                    contemptuous superiority, to which the middle class answered with its profound
                    hatred. This state of things lasted about ten years, until the time of the great
                    building speculations, in which a number of noble families were tempted, and in
                    which they soon found themselves hopelessly involved, and brought into close
                    contact with the middle class. The two classes thus became necessary to each
                    other, and the result was a notable and salutary diminution of prejudice, soon
                    leading to alliances by marriage, which would formerly have seemed impossible,
                    but which the redistribution of wealth rendered mutually advantageous. The
                    appearance at social gatherings of an official element, almost exclusively taken
                    from the middle class, also tended to reduce inequalities of caste. Yet it must
                    be admitted that the parties composing Roman society were drawn together
                    mechanically, rather than fused into anything really homogeneous. 11 is worth
                    mentioning that the Jewish element, which is very strong in business, in
                    journalism, and in the administrations, had made no attempt to enter Roman
                    society. Rome and Genoa are practically the only Italian cities in which
                    Israelites are rigidly excluded from social intimacy, and are only met on
                    official occasions. (M. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cr.)</hi>

               </p>               <p>Both the city and the state of Rome are represented in tradition as having been
                    gradually formed by the fusion of separate communities. The original settlement
                    of Romulus is said to have been limited to the Palatine Mount. With this were
                    united before the end of his reign the Capitoline and the Quirinal; Tullus
                    Hostilius added the Caelian, Ancus Martius the Aventine; and finally Servius
                    Tullius included the Esquiline and Viminal, and enclosed the whole seven hills
                    with a stone wall. The growth of the state closely followed that of the city. To
                    the original Romans on the Palatine were added successively the Sabine followers
                    of King Tatius, Albans transplanted by Tullus, Latins by Ancus, and lastly the
                    Etruscan comrades of Caeles Vibenna. This tradition is supported by other and
                    more positive evidence. The race of the Luperci on February 15 was in fact a
                    purification of the boundaries of the “ ancient Palatine town,” <note

                    name ascribed to the united Aborigines and Trojans; the immediate progenitors of
                    Rome are the Latin Lavinium and the Latin Alba. Much evidence in the language,
                    the religion, the institutions and the civilization of early Rome points to the

                    question at length, but some fairly certain points may be mentioned. The
                    probability of Sabine raids and a Sabine settlement, possibly on the Quirinal
                    Hill, in very early times may be admitted. The incursions of the highland
                    Apennine tribes into the lowlands fill a large place in early Italian history.
                    The Latins were said to have originally descended from the mountain glens near
                    Reate. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="207"> Cato ap.

                    general considerations recent inquiry enables us to advance to some few definite
                    conclusions. (1) It may now be regarded as established beyond question that the
                    patrician class at Rome sprang from a race other than that of the plebeians.</p>               <p>tradition of a Sabine settlement on the Quirinal, and considered that , in the

                    so did Zoller <hi rend="italic">(Latium u. Rom,</hi> Leipzig, 1878), who,
                    however, placed it after the expulsion of the Tarquins.</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0616" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0661.jp2"/>
               <p>This was long ago recognized by Schweglcr (see his <hi rend="italic">Romische
                        Geschichte,</hi> passim) on the sufficient ground of the great religious
                    cleavage between the two orders. Such jealousy of mutual contact in religious
                    matters as is apparent all through the history of the city very rarely, if ever,
                    springs from any other source than a real difference of race. This point was
                    developed by Professor W. Ridgeway in his <hi rend="italic">Who were the
                        Romans?</hi> (London, 1908), where he points out (a) that the deities tended
                    by the three greater or patrician flamens, namely, Dialis, Martialis,
                    Quirinalis, were all closely connected with the Sabines; <hi rend="italic"
                        >(b)</hi> further, that the patrician form of marriage, the highly religious
                    ceremony called <hi rend="italic">Conjarreatio,</hi> differed entirely from the
                    other forms, <hi rend="italic">Usus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Coemptio,</hi>
                    which there is reason to attribute to a plebeian origin; (c) that the arms,
                    especially the round shield, carried by the first class in the originally
                    military constitution of Servius Tullius (sec below), arc characteristic of the
                    warriors of Central Europe in the Early Iron and Bronze Age, whereas those of
                    the remaining classes can be shown to have been in general use during the
                    immediately preceding period in the Mediterranean lands.</p>               <p>For other archaeological evidence separating the patricians from the plebeians,
                    and connecting the patricians closely with the Sabines the reader must be
                    referred to Ridgeway’s essay. It is, however, well to make special mention here
                    of the tradition, which is given by Livy (ii. 16. 4), and is undated but not the
                    less probable for being a non-annalistic tradition, preserved in the <hi
                        rend="italic">gens</hi> itself, of the prompt welcome given to the Sabine
                    Appius Claudius, the founder of the haughtiest of all the Roman noble families,
                    by the patricians of Rome and his immediate admission to all their political
                    privileges. Ridgeway points out that this implies, at that early time, a
                    substantial identity of race.</p>               <p>On the linguistic side of the question it is well to mention for clearness’ sake
                    that this Safine or patrician class marked its ascendancy all over Central and
                    Southern Italy, from the 6th century b.c. onwards, by its preference for forming
                    ethnic names with the suffix <hi rend="italic">-no-</hi> which it frequently
                    imposed also upon the communities whom it brought under its influence. <hi
                        rend="italic">Sabini</hi> (earlier <hi rend="italic">Safini), Romani,
                        Latini, Sidicini, Aricini, Marrucini,</hi> and the like are all names formed
                    in this way (see further Sabini).</p>               <p>2. It may also now be regarded as certain that what we may call the Lower or
                    Earlier Stratum (or Strata) of population in Rome, themselves spoke a language
                    which was as truly Indo-European as the language of their Safine conquerors. In
                    the article Volsci will be found evidence for the conclusion that the language
                    of what has been there entitled the Co-Folk was not less certainly
                    Indo-European, and in some respects probably a less modified form of
                    Indo-European, than that of the Safincs. A number of the names formed with the
                        <hi rend="italic">-co-</hi> suffix and with the <hi rend="italic">-ati-</hi>
                    suffix (which is frequent in the same districts) contain unmistakably
                    Indo-European words such as <hi rend="italic">Graviscae, Marica, dea Marica,
                        Volsci, Casinates, Soracte, Interamnites, Auxumates.</hi> The fusion of this
                    earlier population with the patricians is far easier to imagine when it is
                    recognized that the two parties spoke kindred though by no means identical
                    languages. It is the essentially Indo-European character of the early
                    inhabitants of the Latin plain which has led many scholars to doubt that there
                    was any racial distinction at all between patricians and plebeians, but the
                    increase of knowledge of the dialects spoken in the different regions of Italy
                    has now enabled us to judge this question with very much fuller evidence.</p>               <p>3. There arises, however, the important question or questions as to the origin,
                    or at least the ethnic connexions of this earlier stratum. The task of the
                    historic inquirer will not be completely performed until at least some further
                    progress has been made in connecting this earlier population of the western
                    coast of Italy, on the one hand, with one or more of the early races (see
                    Siculi, Veneti, Liguria, Pelasgians) whom tradition declares to have once
                    inhabited the soil of Latium; and on the other, with the people or peoples whom
                    archaeological research reveals to us as having left behind them different
                    strata of remains, all earlier than the Iron or Roman Age, both in</p>               <p>Latium and in other parts of Italy. Professor Ridgeway has taken a short way
                    with these problems which may prove to be the true one; he classes together as
                    Ligurian all prc-Safine inhabitants of Italy save such elements as, like the
                    Etruscans, can be shown to have invaded it over sea (see Etruria, <hi
                        rend="italic">§ Language).</hi> This is one of the most promising fields of
                    investigation now open to scholars, but in view of the confused and mutilated
                    shape in which the traditions current in ancient times have come down to us, it
                    demands an exceedingly careful scrutiny of the archaeological and the linguistic
                    evidence, and exceedingly cautious judgment in combining them. The point of
                    outstanding importance is to determine whether the earb’er Indo-European
                    population is to be regarded as having been in Italy from the beginning of human
                    habitation. Archaeologists generally like W. Helbig <hi rend="italic">(Die
                        Italiker der Poebene)</hi> and more recently B. Modestov <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Introduction &amp; I’histoire romaine,</hi> Paris, 1907) have been
                    inclined to regard the Ligurians as the most primitive population of Italy, but
                    to distinguish them sharply from the people who built the Lake Settlement and
                    Pile Dwellings, which appear (with important variations of type):—(1) in the
                    western half of the valley of the Po; (2) in the eastern half of the same; (3)
                    in Picenum; (4) in Latium; and (5) as far south as Tarentum. One of the most
                    important points in the identification is the question of the method of burial
                    employed at different epochs by the different communities. (See the works
                    already cited, with that of O. Montelius, <hi rend="italic">La Civilisation
                        primitive en Italie.)</hi>

                    keystone of the primitive political system. It was a primitive association held
                    together by participation in common <hi rend="italic">sacra,</hi> and possessing
                    common festivals, common priests and a common chapel, hall and hearth. As
                    separate associations the curiae were probably older than the Roman state, but,

                        possible that, the curiae were originally connected with separate
                        localities; cf. such names as Foriensis, Veliensis (Fest. 174; Gilbert i.
                        213). </note> however this may be, it is certain that of this state when
                    formed they constituted the only effective political subdivisions. The members

                    when once installed in office. Tradition ascribes to him a position and powers
                    closely resembling those of the heroic kings of Greece. He rules for life, and
                    he is the sole ruler, unfettered by written statutes. He is the supreme judge,
                    settling all disputes and punishing wrongdoers even with death. All other
                    officials are appointed by him. He imposes taxes, distributes lands and erects
                    buildings. Senate and assembly meet only when he convenes them, and meet for
                    little else than to receive communications from him. In war he is absolute

                    religious head of the community. It is his business to consult the gods on its
                    behalf, to offer the solemn sacrifices and to announce the days of the public
                    festivals. Hard by his house was the common hearth of the state, where the

                    earlier state of things when Rome was only an assemblage of clans or village
                    communities, allied indeed, but each still ruled by its own chiefs and headmen,
                    to one in which these groups have been fused into a single state under a common
                    ruler. On the one hand the senate appears as a representative council of chiefs,
                    with inalienable prerogatives of its own, and claiming to be the ultimate
                    depositary of the supreme authority and of the <hi rend="italic">sacra</hi>

                    result. But the occasions on which the assembly could exercise its power must

                    few points only can be considered as fairly well established. If we except the
                    long eventless reign ascribed to King Numa, tradition represents the first kings
                    as incessantly at war with their immediate neighbours. The details of these wars
                    are no doubt mythical; but the implied condition of continual struggle, and the
                    narrow range within which the struggle is confined, may be accepted as true. The
                    picture drawn is that of a small community, with a few square miles of
                    territory, at deadly feud with its nearest neighbours, within a radius of some
                    12 m. round Rome. Nor, in spite of the repeated victories with which tradition
                    credits ’ Romulus, Ancus and Tullus, does there seem to have been any real
                    extension of Roman territory except towards the sea. Fidenae remains Etruscan;
                    the Sabines continue masters up to the Anio; Praeneste, Gabii and Tusculum are
                    still untouched; and on this side it is doubtful if Roman territory, in spite of
                    the possible destruction of Alba, extended to a greater distance than the sixth
                    milestone from Rome. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    destruction of Politorium, Tellenae and Ficana is confirmed by the absence in
                    historical times of any Latin communities in this district.</p>               <p>With the reign of the fifth king Tarquinius Priscus a marked change takes place.
                    The traditional accounts of the last three kings not only wear a more historical
                    air than those of the first four, but they describe something like a
                    transformation of the Roman city and state. Under the rule of these latter kings
                    the separate settlements are for the first time enclosed with a rampart of
                    colossal size and extent. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    assigned the redi vision of the city area into four new districts and the
                    introduction of a new military system. The kings increase in power and surround
                    themselves with new splendour. Abroad, too, Rome suddenly appears as a powerful
                    state ruling far and wide over southern Etruria and Latium. These startling
                    changes are, moreover, ascribed to kings of alien descent, who one and all
                    ascend the throne in the teeth of established constitutional forms. Finally,
                    with the expulsion of the last of them—the younger Tarquin—comes a sudden
                    shrinkage of power. At the commencement of the Republic Rome is once more a
                    comparatively small state, with hostile and independent neighbours at her very
                    doors. It is impossible to. doubt the conviction that the true explanation of
                    this phenomenon is to be found in the supposition that Rome during this period
                    passed under the rule of powerful Etruscan lords. <note anchored="true"

                    centuries b.c., and probably earlier still, the Etruscans appear as ruling
                    widely outside the Emits of Etruria proper. They were supreme in the valley of
                    the Po until their power there was broken by the irruption of Celtic tribes from
                    beyond the Alps, and while still masters of the plains of Lombardy they
                    established themselves in the rich lowlands of Campania, where they held their
                    ground until the capture of Capua by the Samnite highlanders in 423 b.c. It is
                    on the face of it improbable that? a power which had extended its sway from the
                    Alps to the Tiber, and from the Liris to Surrentum, should have left untouched
                    the intervening stretch of country between the Tiber and the Liris. And there is
                    abundant evidence of Etruscan rule in Latium. <note anchored="true"

               </p>               <p>The last of these Etruscan lords to rule in Rome was Tarquin the Proud. He is
                    described as a splendid and despotic monarch.</p>               <p>His sway extended over Latium as far south as Circeii. Aristodemus, tyrant of
                    Cumae, was his ally, and kinsmen of his own were princes at Collatia, at Gabii,
                    and at Tusculum. The Volscian highlanders were chastised, and Signia with its
                    massive walls was built to hold them in check. In Rome itself the Capitoline
                    temple and the great cloaca bore witness to his power. But his rule pressed
                    heavily upon the Romans, and at the last, on the news of the foul wrong done by
                    his son Sextus to a noble Roman matron, Lucretia, the indignant people rose in
                    revolt. Tarquin, who was away besieging Ardea, was deposed; sentence of exile
                    was passed upon him and upon all his race; and the</p>               <p>people swore that* never again should a king rule in Rome. Freed from the
                    tyrant, they chose for themselves two yearly magistrates who should exercise the
                    supreme authority, and thus the Republic of Rome was founded. Three times the
                    banished Tarquin strove desperately to recover the throne he had lost. First of
                    all the men of Veii and Tarquinii marched to his aid, but were defeated in a
                    pitched battle on the Roman frontier. A year later Lars Porsena, prince of
                    Clusium, at the head of all the powers of Etruria, appeared before the gates of
                    Rome, and closely besieged the city, until, moved by the valour of his foe, he
                    granted honourable terms of peace and withdrew. <note anchored="true"

                    until the establishment of the Republic that it plays any part in the history of
                    Rome. No sooner, however, was the overshadowing authority of the king removed
                    than a struggle commenced between the two orders which lasted for more than two
                    centuries. It was in no sense a struggle between a conquering and a conquered
                    class, or between an exclusive citizen body and an unenfranchised mass outside
                    its pale. Patricians and plebeians were equally citizens of Rome, sprung of the

                    probable that the strictness of the old tie of clientship had somewhat relaxed,
                    and that the number of the <hi rend="italic">clientes</hi> was smaller and their

                    admission of conquered Latins, and the freeholders among these had with others
                    been enrolled in the Servian tribes, classes and centuries. The establishment of
                    the Republic invested this military levy of landholders with political rights as
                    an assembly, for by their votes the consuls were chosen and laws passed, and it
                    was the plebeian landholders who formed the main strength of the <hi

                    greater in appearance than in reality. The plebeian landholders commanded only a

                    choice of magistrates they were limited to the patrician candidates nominated by
                    patrician presiding magistrates, and their choice required confirmation not only
                    by the older and smaller assembly of the curiae, in which the patricians and
                    their clients predominated, but also by the patrician <hi rend="italic"
                        >patres.</hi> They could only vote on laws proposed by patrician consuls,
                    and here again the subsequent sanction of the <hi rend="italic">patres</hi> Was
                    necessary. The whole procedure of the <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi> was in
                    short absolutely in the hands of their patrician presidents, and liable to every

                    fought for was protection for their lives and liberties, and the object of

                    times as the greatest safeguard of a Roman’s liberties, it was by no- means at
                    first so effective a protection as it afterwards became. For not only was the
                    operation of the law limited to the bounds of the city, so that the consul in
                    the field or on the march was left as absolute as before, but no security was
                    provided for its observance even within the city by consuls resolved to

                    Aequi, and instead entrenched themselves on a hill across the Anio, some 3 m.
                    from Rome, and known afterwards as the Mons Sacer. The frightened patricians

                    should frame and publish a code of law binding equally on both the orders. These
                    decemviri were to be the sole and supreme magistrates for the year, and the law

                    administration of justice by the magistrates. With the publication of the code
                    the proper work of the decemvirs was finished; nevertheless, for the next year a
                    fresh decemvirate was elected, and it is conceivable that the intention was
                    permanently to substitute government by an irresponsible patrician “ council of
                    ten ” for the old constitution. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    decemvirs themselves was fatal to the continuance of their power. We are told of
                    a second secession of the <hi rend="italic">plebs,</hi> this time to the
                    Janiculum, and of negotiations with the senate, the result ofr which was the

                    chose for themselves tribunes, and in the <hi rend="italic">camitia
                        centuriata</hi> two consuls were created. But this restoration of the old
                    regime was accompanied by legislation which made it an important crisis in the
                    history of the struggle between the orders. With the fall of the decemvirate
                    this struggle enters upon a new phase.</p>               <p>The tribunes appear as at once more powerful and more strictly constitutional
                    magistrates; the plebeian <hi rend="italic">concilia</hi> take their place by
                    the side of the older assemblies; and finally this improved machinery is used
                    not simply in self-defence against patrician oppression but to obtain complete
                    political equality. This change was no doubt due in part to circumstances
                    outside legislation, above all to the expansion of the Roman state, which
                    swelled the numbers and added to the social importance of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >plebs</hi> as compared with the dwindling forces of the close corporation
                    of patrician <hi rend="italic">gentes.</hi> Still the legislation of 449 clearly
                    involved more than a restoration of the old form of government. The
                    Valerio-Horatian laws, besides reaffirming the right of appeal and the
                    inviolability of the tribunes, improved the position of the plebeian assemblies
                    by enacting that <hi rend="italic">plébiscita</hi> passed in them, and, as seems
                    probable, approved by the <hi rend="italic">patres,</hi> should be binding on

               </p>               <p>By this law the tribunes obtained a recognized initiative in legislation.
                    Henceforth the desired reforms were introduced and carried by tribunes in what

                    the <hi rend="italic">patres,</hi> became laws of the state. From this period,
                    too, must be dated the legalization at any rate of the tribune’s right to

                    </note> Henceforward there is no question of the tribune’s right to propose to
                    the <hi rend="italic">plebs</hi> to impose a fine, or of the validity of the
                    sentence when passed. The efficiency of these new weapons of attack was amply
                    proved by the subsequent course of the struggle. Only a few years after the
                    Valerio-Horatian legislation came the <hi rend="italic">lex Camdeia,</hi> itself
                    a <hi rend="italic">plebiscitum</hi> (445 B.c.), by which mixed marriages
                    between patricians and plebeians were declared lawful, and the social
                    exclusiveness of the patriciate broken down. In the same year with this measure,
                    and like it in the interests primarily of the wealthier plebeians, a vigorous
                    attack commenced on the patrician monopoly of the consulate, and round this
                    stronghold of patrician ascendancy the conflict raged until the passing of the
                    Licinian laws in 367. The original proposal of the tribune Gaius Canulcius, in
                    445, that the people should be allowed to elect a plebeian consul was evaded by
                    a compromise. The senate resolved that for the next year, in the stead of
                    consuls, six military tribunes with consular powers should be elected, <note

                        Mommsen, <hi rend="italic">Staatsrecht,</hi> ii. 181. </note> and that the
                    new office should be open to patricians and plebeians alike. The consulship was
                    thus for the time saved from pollution, as the patricians phrased it, but the
                    growing strength of the <hi rend="italic">plebs</hi> is shown by the fact that
                    in fifty years out of the seventy-eight between 444 and 366 they succeeded in
                    obtaining the election of consular tribunes rather than of consuls.</p>               <p>Despite, however, these discouragements, the patricians fought on. Each year
                    they strove to secure the creation of consuls rather than consular tribunes, and
                    failing this strained every nerve to secure for their own order at least a
                    majority among the latter. Even the institution of the censorship (435)? though
                    rendered desirable by the increasing importance and complexity of the census,
                    was, it is probable, due in part to their desire to discount beforehand the
                    threatened loss of the consulship hy diminishing its powers. <note

                    helped to protract the struggle. Between the wealthier plebeians, who were
                    ambitious of high office, and the poorer, whose minds were set rather on
                    allotments of land, there was a division of interest of which the patricians
                    were not slow to take advantage, and to this must be added the pressure of war.
                    The death struggle with Veii and the sack of Rome by the Gauls absorbed for the
                    time all the energies of the community. In 377, however, two of the tribunes, C.
                    Licinius Stolo (see Licinius Stolo, Gaius) and L. Sextius,came forward with
                    proposals which united all sections of the <hi rend="italic">plebs</hi> in their
                    support. Their proposals were as follows: <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial" n="280"> Livy vi. 35, 42 ; Appian, <hi rend="italic"
                            >B.C.</hi> i. 8. </note> (1) that consuls and not consular tribunes be
                    elected; (2) that one consul at least should be a plebeian; (3) that the
                    priestly college, which had the charge of the Sibylline books, should consist of
                    ten members instead of two, and that of these half should be plebeians; (4) that
                    no single citizen should hold in occupation more than 500 acres of the common
                    lands, or pasture upon them more than 100 head of cattle and 500 sheep; (5) that
                    all landowners should employ a certain amount of free as well as slave labour on
                    their estates; (6) that interest already paid on debts should be deducted from
                    the principal, and the remainder paid off in three years. The three last
                    proposals were obviously intended to meet the patres plebiscitis legem comitiis
                    centuriatis tulere, ut quod tributim plebs jussisset populum tencret, qua lege
                    tribuniciis rogationibus telum acerrimum datum est.” What were the precise
                    conditions under which a <hi rend="italic">plebiscitum</hi> became law can, only
                    be, conjectured. The control of the <hi rend="italic">patres</hi> over
                    legislation certainly remained effective until 287 <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    of the scheme. Ten years of bitter conflict followed, but at last, in 367 B.C., the Licinian rogations became law, and one of their
                    authors, L. Sextius, was created the first plebeian consul. For the moment it
                    was some consolation to the patricians that they not only succeeded in detaching
                    from the consulship the administration of civil law, which was entrusted to a
                    separate officer, <hi rend="italic">praetor urbanus,</hi> to be elected by the
                        <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi> of the centuries, with an understanding
                    apparently that he should be a patrician, but also obtained the institution of
                    two additional aediles <hi rend="italic">(aediles curules),</hi> who were in
                    like manner to be members of their own order. <note anchored="true"

                    opening of the consulship, however, the issue of the long contest was virtually
                    decided, and the next eighty years witnessed a rapid succession of plebeian
                    victories. Now that a plebeian consul might preside at the elections, the main
                    difficulty in the way of the nomination and election of plebeian candidates was
                    removed. The proposed patrician monopoly of the new curulc aedileship was almost
                    instantly abandoned. In 356 the first plebeian was made dictator; in 350 the
                    censorship, and in 337 the praetorship were filled for the first time by
                    plebeians; and lastly, in 300, by the <hi rend="italic">lex Ogulnia,</hi> even

               </p>               <p>The expulsion of the Tarquins from Rome, followed as it seems to have been by
                    the emancipation from Etruscan supremacy of all the country between the Tiber
                    and the Liris, entirely altered the aspect of affairs. North of the Tiber the
                    powerful Etruscan city of Veii, after a vain attempt to restore the Tarquins,
                    relapsed into an attitude of sullen hostility towards Rome, which, down to the
                    outbreak of the final struggle in 407, found vent in constant and harassing
                    border forays. The Sabines recommenced their raids across the Anio; from their
                    hills to the south-east the Aequi pressed forward as far as the eastern spurs of
                    the Alban range, and ravaged the low country between that range and the Sabine
                    mountains; the Volsci overran the coast-lands as far as Antium, established them</p>               <p>selves at Velitrac and even wasted the fields within a few miles of Rome. But
                    the good fortune of Rome did not leave her to face these foes single-handed, and
                    it is a significant fact that the history of the Roman advance begins, not with
                    a brilliant victory, but with a timely alliance.</p>               <p>According to Livy, it was in 493, only a few years after the defeat of the
                    prince of Tusculum at Lake Regillus, that a treaty was concluded between Rome
                    and the Latin communities of the Campagna. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial" n="286"> Livy ii. 33; Cic. <hi rend="italic">Pro
                            Balbo,</hi> 23. </note> The alliance was in every respect natural. The
                    Latins were the near neighbours and kinsmen of the Romans, and both Romans and
                    Latins were just freed from Etruscan rule to find themselves as lowlanders and
                    dwellers in towns face to face with a common foe in the ruder hill tribes on
                    their borders. The exact terms of the treaty cannot, any more than the precise
                    circumstances under which it was concluded, be stated with certainty (see
                    Latium), but two points seem clear. There was at first a genuine equality in the
                    relations between the allies; Romans and Latins, though combining for defence
                    and offence, did so without sacrificing their separate freedom of action, even
                    in the matter of waging wars independently of each other. <note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial" n="287"> Livy viii. 2. </note> But,
                    secondly, Rome enjoyed from the first one inestimable advantage. The Latins lay
                    between her and the most active of her foes, the Aequi and Volsci, and served to
                    protect her territories at the expense of their own. Behind this barrier Rome
                    grew strong, and the close of the Aequian and Volscian wars left the Latins her
                    dependents rather than her allies. Beyond the limits of the Campagna Rome found
                    a second ally, hardly less useful than the Latins, in the tribe of the Hernici
                    (“ the men of the rocks ”), in the valley of the Trcrus, who had equal reason
                    with the Romans and Latins to dread the Volsci and Aequi, while their position
                    midway between the two latter peoples made them valuable auxiliaries to the
                    lowlanders of the Campagna.</p>               <p>The treaty with the Hernici is said to have been concluded in 486, <note

                    </note> and the confederacy of the three peoples— Romans, Latins and
                    Hemicans—lasted down to the great Latin war in 340. Confused and untrustworthy
                    as are the chronicles of the early wars of Rome, it is clear that,
                    notwithstanding the acquisition of these allies, Rome made but little way
                    against her foes during the first fifty year&amp; of the existence of the
                    Republic. In 474, it is true, an end was put for a time to the harassing border
                    feud with Veii by a forty years’ peace, an advantage due not so much to Roman
                    valour as to the increasing dangers from other quarters which were threatening
                    the Etruscan states. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                        n="289"> From the Celts in the north especially. </note> But this partial
                    success stands alone, and down to 449 the raids of Sabines, Aequi and Volsci
                    continue without intermission, and are occasionally carried up to the very walls
                    of Rome.</p>               <p>Very different is the impression left by the annals of the next sixty years
                    (449-390). During this period there is an unmistakable development of Roman
                    power on all sides. In southern Etruria the capture of Veii (396) virtually gave
                    Rome the mastery as far as the Ciminian forest. Sutrium and Nepete, “ the gates
                    of Etruria,” became her allies and guarded her interests against any attack from
                    the Etruscan communities to the north, while along the Tiber valley her
                    suzerainty was acknowledged as far as Capena and Falerii. On the Anio frontier
                    we hear of no disturbances from 449 until some ten years after the sack of Rome
                    by the Gauls. In 446 the Aequi appear for the last time before the gates of
                    Rome. After 418 they disappear from Mount Algidus, and in the same year the
                    communications of Rome and Latium with the Hernici in the Trerus valley were
                    secured by the capture and colonization of Labicum. Successive invasions, too,
                    broke the strength of the Volsci, and in 393 a Latin colony was founded as far
                    south as Circeii. In part, no doubt, these Roman successes were due to the
                    improved condition of</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0623" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0668.jp2"/>
               <p>affairs in Rome itself, consequent upon the great reforms carried between 450
                    and 442; but it is equally certain that now, as often afterwards, fortune
                    befriended Rome by weakening, or by diverting the attention of, her opponents.
                    In particular,' her rapid advance in southern Etruria was facilitated by the
                    heavy blows inflicted upon the Etruscans during the 5th century B.c. by Celts, Greeks and Samnites. By the close of this century the
                    Celts had expelled them from the rich plains of what was afterwards known as
                    Cisalpine Gaul, and were even threatening to advance across the Apennines into
                    Etruria proper. The Sicilian Greeks, headed by the tyrants of Syracuse, wrested
                    from them their mastery of the seas, and finally, on the capture of Capua by the
                    Samnites in 423, they lost their possessions in the fertile Campanian plain.
                    These conquests of the Samnites were part of a great southward movement of the
                    highland</p>               <p>Sabellian peoples, the immediate effects of which upon the fortunes of Rome were
                    not confined to the weakening of the Etruscan power. It is probable that the
                    cessation of the Sabine raids across the Anio was partly due to the new outlets
                    which were opened southwards for the restless and populous hill tribes which had
                    so long disturbed the peace of the Latin lowlands. We may conjecture, also, that
                    the growing feebleness exhibited by Volsci and Aequi was in some measure caused
                    by the pressure upon their rear of the Sabellian clans which at this time
                    established themselves near the Fucine lake and along the course of the Liris.</p>               <p>But in 390, only six years after the great victory over her ancient rival Veil,
                    the Roman advance was for a moment checked by a disaster which threatened to
                    alter the course of history in Italy, and which left a lasting impress on the
                    Roman mind. In 391 a Celtic horde left their newly won lands on the Adriatic,
                    and, crossing the Apennines into Etruria, laid siege to the Etruscan city of
                    Clusium (Chiusi). Thence, provoked, it is said, by the conduct of the Roman
                    ambassadors, who, forgetting their sacred character, had fought in the ranks of
                    Clusium and slain a Celtic chief, the barbarians marched upon Rome. On July the
                    18th of 390 b.c., only a few miles from Rome, was fought the disastrous battle
                    of the Allia. The defeat of the Romans was complete, and Rome lay at the mercy
                    of her foe. But in characteristic fashion the Celts halted three days to enjoy
                    the fruits of victory, and time was thus given to put the Capitol at least in a
                    state of defence. The arrival of the barbarians was followed by the sack of the
                    city, but the Capitol remained impregnable. For seven months they besieged it,
                    and then in as sudden a fashion as they had come they disappeared. The Roman
                    chroniclers explain their retreat in their own way, by the fortunate appearance
                    of M. Furius Camillus with the troops which he had collected, at the very moment
                    when famine had forced the garrison on the Capitol to accept terms. More
                    probably the news that their lands across the Apennines were threatened by the
                    Veneti, coupled with the unaccustomed tedium of a long siege and the difficulty
                    of obtaining supplies, inclined the Celts to accept readily a heavy ransom as
                    the price of their withdrawal. But, whatever the reason, it is certain that they
                    retreated, and, though during the next fifty years marauding bands appeared at
                    intervals in the neighbourhood of Rome, and even once penetrated as far south as
                    Campania (361-60), the Celts never obtained any footing in Italy outside the
                    plains in the north which</p>               <p>they had made their own.</p>               <p>Nor, in spite of the defeat on the Allia and the sack of the city, was Rome
                    weakened except for the moment by the Celtic attack. The storm passed away as
                    rapidly as it had come on. The city was hastily rebuilt, and Rome dismayed the
                    enemies who hastened to take advantage of her misfortunes by her undiminished
                    vigour. Her conquests in southern Etruria were successfully defended against
                    repeated attacks from the Etruscans to the north. The creation in 387 of four
                    new tribes (Stellatina, Sabatina, Tromentina, Arnensis) marked the final
                    annexation of the territory of Veii and of the lands lying along the Tiber
                    valley.</p>               <p>A few years later Latin colonies were established at Sutrium and Nepete for the
                    more effectual defence of the frontier, and finally, in 353, the subjugation of
                    South Etruria was completed by the submission of Caere <hi rend="italic"

                    gained by Rome between 390 and 343 b.c. were those won against her old foes the
                    Aequi and Volsci, and her old allies the Latins and Hernicans.</p>               <p>The Aequi indeed, already weakened by their long feud with Rome, and hard
                    pressed by the Sabellian tribes in their rear, were easily dealt with, and after
                    the campaign of 389 we have no further mention of an Aequian war until the last
                    Aequian rising in 304.</p>               <p>The Volsci, who in 389 had advanced to Lanuvium, were met and utterly defeated
                    by Camillus, the conqueror of Veii, and this victory was followed up by the
                    gradual subjugation to Rome of all the lowland country lying between the hills
                    and the sea as far south as Tarracina. Latin colonies were established at
                    Satricum (385), at Setia (379), and at Antium and Tarracina some time before
                    348. In 358 two fresh Roman tribes (Pomptina and Publilia) were formed in the
                    same district. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="291">

               </p>               <p>Rome had now nothing more to fear from the foes who a century ago had threatened
                    her very existence. The lowland country, of which she was the natural centre,
                    from the Ciminian forest to Tarracina, was quiet, and within its limits Rome was
                    by far the strongest power.</p>               <p>But she had now to reckon with the old and faithful allies to whose loyal aid
                    her present position was largely due. The Latini and Hernici had suffered
                    severely in the Aequian and Volscian wars; it is probable that not a few of the
                    smaller communities included in the league had either been destroyed or been
                    absorbed by larger states, and the independence of all alike was threatened by
                    the growing power of Rome. The sack of Rome by the Celts gave them an
                    opportunity of reasserting their independence, and we are consequently told that
                    this disaster was immediately followed by the temporary dissolution of the
                    confederacy, and this again a few years later by a series of actual conflicts
                    between Rome and her former allies. Between 383 and 358 we hear of wars with

                    formally renewed with Latini and Hernici. We cannot, however, be wrong in
                    assuming that the position of the allies under the new league was far inferior
                    to that accorded them by the treaty of Spurius Cassius. <note anchored="true"

                    supremacy in Italy. By 343 B.c. she was already mistress
                    both of the low country stretching from the Ciminian forest to Tarracina and
                    Circeii and of the bordering highlands. Her own territory had largely increased.
                    Across the Tiber the lands of Veii, Capena and Caere were nearly all Roman,
                    while in Latium she had carried her frontiers to Tusculum on the Alban range and
                    to the southernmost limits of the Pomptine district. And this territory was
                    protected by a circle of dependent allies and colonies reaching northward
                    to-Sutrium and Nepete, and southward to Sora on the upper Liris, and to Circeii
                    on the coast. Already, too, she was beginning to be recognized as a power

                    reached Athens, and her subsequent victories over marauding Celtic bands had
                    given her prestige in South</p>               <p>Italy as a bulwark against northern barbarians. In 354 she had formed her first
                    connexions beyond the Liris by a treaty with the Samnitcs, and in 348 followed a
                    far more important treaty with the great maritime state of</p>               <p>Carthage. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="294"> Livy

               </p>               <p>Rome had won her supremacy from the Ciminian forest to the Liris as the champion
                    of the comparatively civilized communities of the lowlands against the rude
                    highland tribes which threatened to overrun them, and so, when her legions first
                    crossed the Liris, it was in answer to an appeal from a lowland city against
                    invaders from the hills. While she was engaged in clearing Latium of Volsci and
                    Aequi, the Sabcllian tribes of the central Apennines had rapidly spread over the
                    southern half of the peninsula. Foremost among theso tribes were the Samnites, a
                    portion of whom had captured the Etruscan city of Capua in 423, the Greek Cumae
                    in 420, and had since then ruled as masters over the fertile Campanian
                    territory. But in their new homes the conquerors soon lost all sense of
                    relationship and sympathy with their highland brethren. They dwelt in cities,
                    amassed Wealth, and inherited the civilization of the Greeks and Etruscans whom
                    they had dispossessed; <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    above all, they had before long to defend themselves in their turn against the
                    attacks of their ruder kinsmen from the hills, and it was for aid against these
                    that the Samnites of Campania appealed to the rising state which had already
                    made herself known as the bulwark of the lowlands north of the Liris, and which
                    with her Latin and Hernican allies had scarcely less interest than the Campanian

                    alliance with Capua and the neighbouring- Campanian towns, and war was formally
                    declared (343) against the Samnites. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    undertook the task of driving the invaders out of Campania. After two campaigns
                    the war was ended in 341 by a treaty, and the Samnites withdrew from the
                    lowlands, leaving Rome the recognized suzerain of the</p>               <p>Campanian cities which had sought her aid. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

               </p>               <p>There is no doubt that the check thus given by Rome to the advance of the
                    hitherto invincible Sabellian highlanders not only made her the natural head and
                    champion of the low countries, south as well as north of the Liris, but also
                    considerably added to her prestige. Carthage sent her congratulations, and the
                    Etruscan city of Falerii voluntarily enrolled herself among the allies of Rome.
                    Of even greater service, however, was the fact that for fifteen years the
                    Samnites remained quiet, for this inactivity, whatever its cause, enabled Rome
                    triumphantly to surmount a danger which threatened for the moment to wreck her
                    whole position. This danger was nothing less than a desperate effort on the part
                    of nearly all her allies and dependants south of the Tiber to throw off the yoke
                    of her supremacy. The way was led by her ancient confederates the Latini, whose
                    smouldering discontent broke into open flame directly the fear of a Samnite
                    attack was removed. From the Latin Campagna and the Sabine hills the revolt
                    spread westward and southward to Antium and Tarracina, and even to the towns of
                    the Campanian plain,</p>               <p>where the mass of the inhabitants at once repudiated the alliance formed with
                    Rome by the ruling class. The struggle was sharp but short. In two pitched
                    battles <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="298"> At the

                    the strength of the insurrection was broken, and two more campaigns sufficed for
                    the complete reduction of such of the insurgent communities as still held out.
                    The revolt crushed, Rome set herself deliberately to the task of re-establishing
                    on a new and firmer basis her supremacy over the lowlands, and in doing so laid
                    the foundations of that marvellous organization which was destined to spread
                    rapidly over Italy, and to withstand the attacks even of Hannibal. The old
                    historic Latin league ceased to exist, though its memory was still preserved by
                    the yearly Latin festival on the Alban Mount. Most if not all of the common land
                    of the league became Roman territory; <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    The rest, with the Latin colonies, were ranked as Latin allies of Rome, but on
                    terms which secured their complete dependence upon the sovereign city. The
                    policy of isolation, which became so cardinal a principle of Roman rule, was now
                    first systematically applied. No rights of <hi rend="italic">conubium</hi> or

               </p>               <p>In Campania and the coast-lands connecting Campania with Rome, a policy of
                    annexation was considered safer than that of alliance. Of the two frontier posts
                    of the Volsci,</p>               <p>Antium and Velitrae, the former was constituted a Roman colony, its long galleys
                    burnt and their prows set up in the Forum at Rome, while the walls of Velitrae
                    were razed to the ground, its leading men banished beyond the Tiber, and their
                    lands given to Roman settlers. Farther south on the route to Campania, Fundi and
                    Formiae were, after the precedent set in the case of Caere, declared Roman and
                    granted the civil rights of Roman citizenship, while lastly in Campania itself
                    the same status was given to Capua, Cumae, and the smaller communities dependent

                    Volscian town to offer resistance to Rome, was subdued <hi rend="sup">ln</hi>

                    forced to accept the Roman franchise. Lastly, to strengthen the lines of defence
                    against the Sabellian tribes, two colonies with the rights of Latin allies were
                    established at Cales (334) and at Fregellae (328). The settlement of the
                    lowlands was accomplished. As a single powerful and compact state with an outer
                    circle of closely dependent allies, Rome now stood in sharp contrast with the
                    disunited and degenerate cities of northern Etruria, the loosely organized
                    tribes of the Apennines, and the decaying and disorderly Greek towns of the
                    south.</p>               <p>The strength of this system was now to be tried by a struggle with the one
                    Italian people who were still ready and able to contest with Rome the supremacy
                    of the peninsula.</p>               <p>The passive attitude of the Samnites between 342 and 327 was no doubt largely
                    due to the dangers which had suddenly threatened them in South Italy. But the
                    death of Alexander of Epirus, in 332, <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    formidable opponent there, and left them free to turn their attention to the
                    necessity of checking the steady advance of Rome. In 327, the year after the
                    ominous foundation of a Roman colony at Fregellae, a pretext for renewing the
                    struggle was offered them. The</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0625" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0670.jp2"/>

                    Rome by its raids into her territory in Campania. The Samnitcs sent a force to
                    defend it, and Rome replied by a declaration of war. The two opponents were not
                    at first sight unequally matched, and had the Sabcllian tribes held firmly
                    together the issue of the struggle might have been different. As it was,
                    however, the Lucanians to the south actually joined Rome from the first, while
                    the northern clans, Marsi, Vestini, Paeligni, Frcntani, after a feeble and
                    lukewarm resistance, subsided into a neutrality which was exchanged in 304 for a
                    formal alliance with Rome. An even greater advantage to</p>               <p>Rome from the outset was the enmity existing between the Samnites and the
                    Apulians, the latter of whom from the first joined Rome and thus gave her a
                    position in the rear of her enemy and in a country eminently well fitted for
                    maintaining a large military force. These weaknesses on the Samnite side were
                    amply illustrated by the events of the war.</p>               <p>The first seven or eight years were marked by one serious disaster to the Roman
                    arms, the defeat at the Caudine Forks (321), but, when in 318 the Samnites asked
                    for and obtained a two years’ truce, Rome had succeeded not only in inflicting
                    several severe blows upon her enemies but in isolating them from outside help.
                    The Lucanians to the south were her allies. To the east, in the rear of Samnium,
                    Apulia acknowledged the suzerainty of Rome, and Luceria, captured in 320, had
                    been established as a base of Roman operations. Finally to the north the Romans
                    had easily overcome the feeble resistance of the Vestini and Frentani, and
                    secured through their territories a safe passage for their legions to Apulia. On
                    the renewal of hostilities in 316, the Samnites, bent on escaping from the net
                    which was being slowly drawn round them, made a series of desperate efforts to
                    break through the lines of defence which protected Latium and Campania. Sora and
                    Fregellae on the upper Liris were captured by a sudden attack; the Ausones in
                    the low country near the mouth of the same river were encouraged to revolt by
                    the appearance of the Samnite army; and in Campania another army, attracted by
                    rumours of disturbance, all but defeated the Roman consuls under the very walls
                    of Capua. But these efforts were unavailing. Sora and Fregellae were recovered
                    as quickly as they had been lost, and the frontier there was strengthened by the
                    establishment of a colony at Interamna. The Ausones were punished by the
                    confiscation of their territory, and Roman supremacy further secured by the two
                    colonies of Suessa and Pontia (312). The construction of the famous Via Appia,
                        <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="305"> Ibid. ix. 29;
                        see Appia, Via. </note> the work of the censor Appius Claudius Caecus,
                    opened a safe and direct route to Campania, while the capture of Nola deprived
                    the Samnites of their last important stronghold in the Campanian lowlands. The
                    failure of these attempts broke the courage even of the Samnites. Their hopes
                    were indeed raised for a moment by the news that Etruria had risen against Rome
                    (310), but their daring scheme of effecting a union with the Etruscans was
                    frustrated by the energy of the Roman generals. Five years later (305) the
                    Romans revenged a Samnite raid into</p>               <p>Campania by an invasion of Samnium itself. Arpinum on</p>               <p>.the frontier was taken, and at last, after a twenty-two</p>               <p>years’ struggle, the Second Samnite War was</p>               <p>closed by a renewal of the ancient treaty with</p>               <p>Rome (304). <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="306"> Ibid.

                    ancient allies. The tribal confederacy was broken up, and all the Hernican
                    communities, with the exception of three which had not joined the revolt, were
                    incorporated with the Roman state as municipia, with the civil rights of the
                    Roman franchise. Between the Hernican</p>               <p>valley and the frontiers of the nearest Sabellian tribes lay what remained of
                    the once formidable people of the Aequi. In their case, too, a revolt (304) was
                    followed by the annexation of their territory, which was marked in this case by
                    the formation there (301) of two Roman tribes (Aniensis and Teretina). <note

                    Not content with thus carrying the borders of their own territory up to the very
                    frontiers of the Sabellian country, Rome succeeded (304) in finally detaching
                    from the Sabellian confederacy all the tribes lying <note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial" n="309"> Ibid. ix. 45. </note> between the
                    north-east frontier of Latium and the Adriatic Sea. Henceforward the Marsi,
                    Paeligni, Vestini, Marrucini and Frentani were enrolled among the allies of
                    Rome, and not only swelled her forces in the field but interposed a useful
                    barrier between her enemies to the north in Etruria and Umbria and those to the
                    south in Samnium, while they connected her directly with the friendly Apulians.
                    Lastly, as a security for the fidelity at least of the nearest of these allies,
                    colonies were planted in the Marsian territories at Alba Fueentia (303) and at
                    Carsioli (298). A significant indication of the widening range of Rome’s
                    influence in Italy, and of the new responsibilities rapidly pressing upon her,
                    is the fact that when in 302 the Spartan Clconymus landed in the territory of
                    the Sallentini, far away in the south-east, he was met and repulsed by a Roman
                    force. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="310"> Ibid. x.

               </p>               <p>Six years after the conclusion of the treaty which ended the Second Samnite War,
                    news arrived that the Samnites were harassing the Lucanians. Rome at once
                    interfered to protect her allies. Samnium was invaded in force, the country
                    ravaged and one stronghold after another captured. Unable any longer to hold
                    their own in a position where they were hedged round by enemies, the Samnite
                    leaders turned as a last hope to the communities of northern Etruria, to the
                    free tribes of Umbria and to the once dreaded Celts. With a splendid daring they
                    formed the scheme of uniting all these peoples with themselves in a last
                    desperate effort to break the power of Rome.</p>               <p>For some forty years after the final annexation of southern Etruria (351 b.c.)
                    matters had remained unchanged in that quarter. Sutrium and Nepcte still guarded
                    the Roman frontier; the natural boundary of the Ciminian forest was still
                    intact; and up the valley of the Tiber Rome had not advanced beyond Falerii, a
                    few miles short of the most southerly Umbrian town Oericulum. But in 311, on the
                    expiry, apparently of the long truce with Rome, concluded in 351, the northern
                    Etruscans, alarmed no doubt by the rapid advances which Rome was making farther
                    south, rose in arms and attacked Sutrium. The attack, however, recoiled
                    disastrously upon the heads of the assailants. A Roman force promptly relieved
                    Sutrium, and its leader, Q. Fabius Rullianus, without awaiting orders from home,
                    boldly plunged into the wilds of the Ciminian forest, and crossing them safely
                    swept with fire and sword over the rich lands to the north. Then turning
                    southward he met and utterly defeated the forces which the Etruscans had hastily
                    raised in the hopes of intercepting him at the Vadimonian Lake. <note

                    This decisive victory ended the war. The Etruscan cities, disunited among
                    themselves, and enervated by long years of peace, abandoned the struggle for the
                    time, paida heavy indemnity and concluded a truce with Rome (309-8). In the same
                    year the promptitude of Fabius easily averted a threatened attack by the
                    Umbrians, but Rome proceeded nevertheless to fortify herself in her invariable
                    fashion against future dangers on this side, by an alliance with Oericulum,
                    which was followed ten years later (299) by a colony at Nequinum, <note

               <p>of Umbria rendered them as valuable to Rome as the Apulians had proved farther
                    south.</p>               <p>Fourteen years had passed since the battle on the Vadimonian Lake, when the
                    Samnites appeared on the borders of Etruria and called on the peoples of
                    northern Italy to rise against the common enemy. Their appeal, backed by the
                    presence of their troops, was successful. The Etruscans found courage to face
                    the Roman legions once more; a few of the Umbrians joined them; but the most
                    valuable allies to the Samnites were the Celts, who had for some time threatened
                    a raid across the Apennines, and who now marched eagerly into Umbria and joined
                    the coalition. The news that the Celts were in motion produced a startling
                    effect at Rome, and every nerve was strained to meet this new danger. While two
                    armies were left in southern Etruria as reserves, the two consuls, Q. Fabius
                    Maximus Rullianus and P. Decius Mus the younger, both tried soldiers, marched
                    northwards up the valley of the Tiber and into Umbria at the head of four Roman
                    legions and a still larger force of Italian allies. At Sentinum, on the further
                    side of the Apennines, they encountered the united forces of the Celts and
                    Samnites, the Etruscans and Umbrians having, it is said, been withdrawn for the
                    defence of their own homes. The battle that followed was desperate, and the
                    Romans lost one of their consuls, Decius, and more than 8000 men. <note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="313"> Livy x. 27. </note>
                    But the Roman victory was decisive. The Celts were annihilated, and the fear of
                    a second Celtic attack on Rome removed. All danger from the coalition was over.
                    The Etruscan communities gladly purchased peace by the payment of indemnities.
                    The rising in Umbria, never formidable, died away, and the Samnites were left
                    single-handed to bear the whole weight of the wrath of Rome. During four years
                    more, however, they desperately defended their highland homes, and twice at
                    least, in 293 and 292, they managed to place in the field a force sufficient to
                    meet the Roman legions on equal terms. At last, in 290, the consul M*.Curius
                    Dentatus finally exhausted their power of resistance. Peace was concluded, and
                    it is significant of the respect inspired at Rome by their indomitable courage
                    that they were allowed to become the allies of Rome, on equal terms and without
                    any sacrifice of</p>               <p>independence. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="314">

                    stretching inland to the north-east borders of Etruria, and these too now fell
                    into her hands. Ten years after their defeat at Sentinum (285-84) a Celtic force
                    descended into Etruria, besieged Arretium and defeated the relieving force
                    despatched by Rome. In</p>               <p>283 the consul L. Cornelius Dolabclla was sent to avenge the insult. He
                    completely routed the Senones. Their lands were annexed by Rome, and a colony
                    established at Sena on the coast. This success, followed as it was by the
                    decisive defeat of the neighbouring tribe of the Boii, who had invaded Etruria
                    and penetrated as far south as the Vadimonian Lake, awed the Celts into quiet,
                    and for more than forty years there was comparative tranquillity in northern
                    Italy. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="318"> Ibid. xii.

               </p>               <p>In the south, however, the claims of Rome to supremacy</p>               <p>were now to be disputed by a new and formidable foe. At the close of the Third
                    Samnite War the Greek cities on the southern coast of Italy found themselves
                    once more harassed by the Sabellian tribes on their borders, whose energies, no
                    longer absorbed by the long struggles in central Italy, now found an attractive
                    opening southward. Naturally enough the Greeks, like the Capuans sixty years
                    before, appealed for aid to Rome (283-82), and like the Capuans they offered in
                    return to recognize the suzerainty of the great Latin Republic. In reply a Roman
                    force under C. Fabricius Luscinus marched into south Italy, easily routed the
                    marauding bands of Lucanians, Bruttians and Samnites, and established Roman
                    garrisons in Locri, Croton, Rhegium and Thurii. At Tarentum, the most powerful
                    and flourishing of the Greek seaports, this sudden and rapid advance of Rome
                    excited the greatest anxiety. Tarentum was already allied by treaty (301) with
                    Rome, and she had now to decide whether this treaty should be exchanged for one
                    which would place her, like the other Greek communities, under the protectorate
                    of Rome, or whether she should find some, ally able and willing to assist in
                    making a last stand for independence. The former course, in Tarentum, as before
                    at Capua, was the one favoured by the aristocratic party; the latter was eagerly
                    supported by the mass of the people and their leaders. While matters were still
                    in suspense, the appearance, contrary to the treaty, of a Roman squadron off the
                    harbour decided the controversy. The Tarentines, indignant at the insult,
                    attacked the hostile fleet, killed the admiral and sunk most of the ships. Still
                    Rome, relying probably on her partisans in the city, tried negotiation, and an
                    alliance appeared likely after all, when suddenly the help for which the
                    Tarentine democrats had been looking appeared, and war with Rome was resolved
                    upon (281-80). <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="319">

                    </note> whose timely appearance seemed for the moment to have saved the
                    independence of Tarentum, was the most brilliant of the military adventurers
                    whom the disturbed times following the death of Alexander the Great had brought
                    into prominence. High-spirited, generous and ambitious, he had formed the scheme
                    of rivalling Alexander’s achievements in the East, by winning for himself an
                    empire in the West. He' aspired not only to unite under his rule the Greek
                    communities of Italy and Sicily, but to overthrow the great Phoenician state of
                    Carthage—the natural enemy of Greeks in the West, as Persia had been in the
                    East. Of Rome it is clear that he knew little or nothing; the task of ridding
                    the Greek seaports of their barbarian foes he no doubt regarded as an easy one;
                    and the splendid force he brought with him was intended rather for the conquest
                    of the West than for the preliminary work of chastising a few Italian tribes, or
                    securing the submission of the unwarlike Italian Greeks. He defeated the Roman
                    consul, M. Valerius Laevinus, on the banks of the Liris (280), and gained the
                    support of Xhe Greek cities as well as that of numerous bands of Samnites,</p>               <p>Lucanians and Bruttians. But, to the disappointment of his new allies, Pyrrhus
                    showed no anxiety to follow up his advantage. His heart was set on Sicily and
                    Africa, and his immediate object was to come to terms with Rome. But though he
                    advanced as near Rome as Anagnia (279), nothing could shake the resolution of
                    the senate, and in the next year (278) he again routed the legions at Asculum
                    (Ascoli), but only to find that the indomitable resolution of the enemy was
                    strengthened by defeat. He now crossed into Sicily, where, though at first
                    successful, he was unable to achieve any lasting result. Soured and
                    disappointed, Pyrrhus returned to Italy (276) to find the Roman legions steadily
                    moving southwards, and his Italian allies disgusted by his desertion of their
                    cause. In 275 the decisive battle of the war was fought at Beneventum. The
                    consul, M’. Curius Dentatus, the conqueror of Samnium, gained a complete
                    victory,</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0627" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0672.jp2"/>
               <p>and Pyrrhus, unable any longer to face his opponents in the field, and
                    disappointed of all assistance from his allies, retreated to disgust to Tarentum

                    it was granted a treaty of alliance, but its walls were razed and its fleet
                    handed over to Rome. In 270 Rhegium also entered the ranks of Roman allies, and
                    finally in 269 a single campaign crushed the last efforts at resistance in</p>               <p>Samnium. Rome was now at leisure to consolidate the position she had won.
                    Between 273 and 263 three new colonies were founded in Samnium and
                    Lucania—Paestum in 273, Beneventum in 268, Aesernia in 263. In central Italy the
                    area of Roman territory was increased by the full enfranchisement (268) of the

                    every possible way she strove to isolate them from each other, while binding
                    them closely to herself. The old federal groups were in most cases broken up,
                    and each of the members united with Rome by a special treaty of alliance. In
                    Etruria, Latium, Campania and Magna Graecia the city state was taken as the
                    unit; in central Italy where urban life was non-existent, the unit was the
                    tribe. The northern Sabellian peoples, for instance—the Marsi, Paeligni,
                    Vestini, Marrucini, Frentani—were now constituted as separate communities in
                    alliance with Rome. In many cases, too, no freedom of trade or intermarriage was
                    allowed between the allies themselves, a policy afterwards systematically
                    pursued in the provinces. Nor were all these numerous allied communities placed
                    on the same footing as regarded their relations with Rome herself. To begin
                    with, a sharp distinction was drawn between the“ Latini” and the general mass of
                    Italian allies. The “ Latins ” of this period had little more than the name in
                    common with the old thirty Latin peoples of the days of Spurius Cassius. With a
                    few exceptions, such as Tibur and Praeneste, the latter had either disappeared
                    or had been incorporated with the Roman state, and the Latins cf 268 B.c. were
                    almost exclusively the “ Latin colonies,” that is to say, communities founded by
                    Rome, composed of men of Roman blood, and whose only claim to the title “ Latin
                    ” lay in the fact that Rome granted to them some portion of the rights and
                    privileges formerly enjoyed by the old Latin cities under the</p>               <p>Cassian treaty. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="326">

                    planted as Roman garrisons among alien and conquered peoples. The Roman citizen
                    who joined a Latin colony lost his citizenship—to have allowed him to retain it

                    not only shared in the booty, but claimed a portion of any land confiscated by
                    Rome and declared “ public.” These privileges, coupled with their close natural
                    affinities with Rome, successfully secured the fidelity of the Latin colonies,
                    which became not only the most efficient props of Roman supremacy, but powerful
                    agents in the work of Romanizing Italy. Below the privileged Latins stood the
                    Italian allies; and here again we know generally that there were considerable
                    differences of status, determined in each case by the terms of their respective
                    treaties with Rome. We are told that the Greek cities of Neapolis and Heraclea

                    attached as closely to herself as they were clearly separated from each other,
                    and from the first she took every security for the maintenance of her own
                    paramount authority. Within its own borders, each ally was left to manage its
                    own affairs as an independent state. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    badges which marked subjection to Rome in the provinces—the resident magistrate

                    of one ally with another, in all questions of the general interests of Italy and
                    of foreign policy, the decision rested solely with Rome. The place of a federal
                    constitution, of a federal council, of federal officers, was filled by the Roman
                    senate, assembly and magistrates. The maintenance of peace and order in Italy,
                    the defence of the coasts and frontiers, the making of war or peace with foreign
                    powers, were matters the settlement of which Rome kept entirely in her own
                    hands. Each allied state, in time of war, was called upon for a certain
                    contingent of men, but, though its contingent usually formed a distinct corps
                    under officers of its own, its numerical strength was fixed by Rome, it was
                    brigaded with the Roman legions, and was under the orders of the Roman consul.

                        The importance of this duty of the allies is expressed in the phrase, “
                        socii nominisve Latini quibus ex formula togatorum milites in terra Italia
                        imperare solent.” </note>
               </p>               <p>This paramount authority of Rome throughout the peninsula was confirmed and
                    justified by the fact that Rome herself was now infinitely more powerful than
                    any one of her numerous allies. Her territory, as distinct from that of the
                    allied states, covered something Eke one-third of the peninsula south of the
                    Aesis. Along the west coast it stretched from Caere to the southern borders of
                    Campania. Inland, it included the former territories of the Aequi and Hernici,
                    the Sabine country, and even extended eastward into-. Picenum, while beyond
                    these limits were outlying districts, such as the lands of the Senonian Celts,
                    with the Roman colony of Sena, and others elsewhere in Italy, which had been
                    confiscated by Rome and given over to Roman settlers. Since the first important
                    annexation of territory after the capture of Veii (396), twelve new tribes had
                    been formed, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="331"> Four

                    until 241 B.c., when the Carthaginians were compelled to cede Sicily and the
                    Lipari islands to Rome, and to pay an indemnity of 3200 talents (about
                    £800,000).</p>               <p>The struggle was one in which both Rome and Carthage were serving an
                    apprenticeship in a warfare the conditions of which were unfamiliar to both. The
                    Roman legions were foes very unlike any against which the Carthaginian leaders
                    had ever led their motley array of mercenaries, while Rome was called upon for
                    the first time to fight a war across the sea, and to fight with ships against
                    the greatest naval power of the age. The novelty of these conditions accounts
                    for much of the vacillating and uncertain action observable on both sides. It is
                    possible that Hamilcar had already made up his mind that Rome must be attacked
                    and crushed in Italy, but his government attempted nothing more than raids upon
                    the coast. There are indications also that some in the Roman senate saw no end
                    to the struggle but in the destruction of Carthage; yet an invasion of Africa
                    was only once seriously attempted, and then only a half-hearted support was
                    given to the expedition. But these peculiarities in the war served to bring out
                    in the clearest relief the strength and the weakness of the two contending
                    states. The chief dangers for Carthage lay obviously in the jealousy exhibited
                    at home of her officers abroad, in the difficulty of controlling her mercenary
                    troops, and in the ever-present possibility of disaffection among her subjects
                    in Libya—dangers which even the genius of Hannibal failed finally to surmount.
                    Rome, on the other hand, was strong in the public spirit of her citizens, the
                    fidelity of her allies, the valour and discipline of her legions. What she
                    needed was a system which should make a better use of her splendid materials
                    than one under which her plans were shaped from day to day by a divided senate,
                    and executed by officers who were changed every year, and by soldiers most of
                    whom returned home at the close of each summer’s campaign.</p>               <p>The interval between the First and Second Punic Wars was employed by both Rome
                    and Carthage in strengthening their respective positions. The eastern end of
                    Sicily was still left under the rule of Hiero as the ally of Rome, but the
                    larger western portion of the island became directly subject to Rome, and a
                    temporary arrangement seems to have been made for its government, either by one
                    of the two praetors, or possibly by a quaestor. <note anchored="true"

                    had not been surrendered to Rome by the treaty of 241, but three years later
                    (239), on the invitation of the Carthaginian mercenaries stationed in the
                    islands, a Roman force occupied them; Carthage protested, but, on the Romans
                    threatening war, she gave way, and Sardinia and Corsica were formally ceded to
                    Rome, though it was some seven or eight years before all resistance on the part
                    of the natives themselves was crushed. In 227, however, the senate considered
                    matters ripe for the establishment of a separate administration in her oversea
                    possessions. In that year two additional praetors were elected; to one was
                    assigned the charge of western Sicily, to the other that of Sardinia and
                    Corsica, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="334"> Livy,

                    the Roman provincial system were laid. Of at least equal importance for the
                    security of the peninsula was the subjugation of the Celtic tribes in the valley
                    of the Po. These, headed by the Boii and Insubres and assisted by levies from
                    the Celts to the westward, had in 225 alarmed the whole of Italy by invading
                    Etruria and penetrating to Clusium, only three days’ journey from Rome. Here,
                    however, their courage seems to have failed them. They retreated northward along
                    the Etruscan coast, until at Telamon their way was barred by the Roman legions,
                    returning from Sardinia to the defence of Rome, while a second consular army
                    hung upon their rear. Thus hemmed in, the Celts fought desperately,</p>               <p>but were completely defeated and the flower of their tribesmen slain. The Romans
                    followed up their success by invading the Celtic territory. The Boii were easily
                    reduced to submission. The Insubres, north of the Po, resisted more obstinately,
                    but by 222 the war was over, and all the tribes in the rich Po valley
                    acknowledged the supremacy of Rome. The conquered Celts were not enrolled among
                    the Italian allies of Rome, but were treated as subjects beyond the frontier.
                    Three colonies were founded to hold them in check—Placentia (218) and Cremona in
                    the territory of the Insubres, Mutina (183)* in that of the Boii; and the great
                    northern road (Via Flaminia) was completed as far as the Celtic border at
                    Ariminum.</p>               <p>On the Adriatic coast the immediate interests of Rome were limited to rendering
                    the sea safe for Italian trade. It was with this object that, in 229, the first
                    Roman expedition crossed the Adriatic, and inflicted severe chastisement on the
                    Illyrian pirates of the opposite coast. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    means of establishing for the first time direct political relations between Rome
                    and the states of Greece proper, to many of which the suppression of piracy in
                    the Adriatic was of as much importance as to Rome herself. Alliances were
                    concluded with Corcyra, Epidamnus, and ApoIIonia; and embassies explaining the

                    the Achaeans, and even to Athens and Corinth. Everywhere they were well
                    received, and the admission of the Romans to the Isthmian games <note

                    states against both barbarian tribes and foreign despots. Meanwhile Carthage had
                    acquired a possession which promised to compensate her for the loss of Sicily,
                    Sardinia and Corsica. The genius of her greatest citizen and soldier, Hamilcar
                    Barca, had appreciated the enormous value of the Spanish peninsula, and
                    conceived the scheme of founding there a Carthaginian dominion which should not
                    only add to the wealth of Carthage, but supply her with a base of operations for
                    a war of revenge with Rome. The conquest of southern and eastern Spain, begun by
                    Hamilcar (236-28) and carried on by his kinsman Hasdrubal (228-21), was
                    completed by his son Hannibal, who, with all his father’s genius, inherited also
                    his father’s hatred of Rome, and by 219 the authority of Carthage had been
                    extended as far as the Ebro (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Spain,</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">History).</hi> Rome had not watched this rapid advance without
                    anxiety, but, probably owing to her troubles with the Celts, she had contented
                    herself with stipulating (226) that Carthage should not carry her arms beyond
                    the Ebro, so as to threaten Rome’s ancient ally, the Greek Massilia (mod.
                    Marseilles), and with securing the independence of the two nominally Greek
                    communities, Emporiae . and Saguntum, <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Italy, and who could not afford to leave behind him in Spain a state allied to
                    Rome. In 219, therefore, disregarding the protests of a Roman embassy, he
                    attacked and took Saguntum, an act which, as he had foreseen, rendered a rupture
                    with Rome inevitable, while it set his own hands free for a further advance.</p>               <p>For the details of the war which followed, the reader may be referred to the

                    defection of almost the whole of southern Italy, with the exception of the Latin
                    colonies and the Greek coast towns. In 215, moreover, Philip V. of Macedon
                    formed an alliance with Hannibal and threatened to invade Italy; in 214 Syracuse
                    revolted, and in 212 the Greek cities in S. Italy went over to Hannibal. But the

                    until 241 B.c., when the Carthaginians were compelled to cede Sicily and the
                    Lipari islands to Rome, and to pay an indemnity of 3200 talents (about
                    £800,000).</p>               <p>The struggle was one in which both Rome and Carthage were serving an
                    apprenticeship in a warfare the conditions of which were unfamiliar to both. The
                    Roman legions were foes very unlike any against which the Carthaginian leaders
                    had ever led their motley array of mercenaries, while Rome was called upon for
                    the first time to fight a war across the sea, and to fight with ships against
                    the greatest naval power of the age. The novelty of these conditions accounts
                    for much of the vacillating and uncertain action observable on both sides. It is
                    possible that Hamilcar had already made up his mind that Rome must be attacked
                    and crushed in Italy, but his government attempted nothing more than raids upon
                    the coast. There are indications also that some in the Roman senate saw no end
                    to the struggle but in the destruction of Carthage; yet an invasion of Africa
                    was only once seriously attempted, and then only a half-hearted support was
                    given to the expedition. But these peculiarities in the war served to bring out
                    in the clearest relief the strength and the weakness of the two contending
                    states. The chief dangers for Carthage lay obviously in the jealousy exhibited
                    at home of her officers abroad, in the difficulty of controlling her mercenary
                    troops, and in the ever-present possibility of disaffection among her subjects
                    in Libya—dangers which even the genius of Hannibal failed finally to surmount.
                    Rome, on the other hand, was strong in the public spirit of her citizens, the
                    fidelity of her allies, the valour and discipline of her legions. What she
                    needed was a system which should make a better use of her splendid materials
                    than one under which her plans were shaped from day to day by a divided senate,
                    and executed by officers who were changed every year, and by soldiers most of
                    whom returned home at the close of each summer’s campaign.</p>               <p>The interval between the First and Second Punic Wars was employed by both Rome
                    and Carthage in strengthening their respective positions. The eastern end of
                    Sicily was still left under the rule of Hiero as the ally of Rome, but the
                    larger western portion of the island became directly subject to Rome, and a
                    temporary arrangement seems to have been made for its government, either by one
                    of the two praetors, or possibly by a quaestor. <note anchored="true"

                    had not been surrendered to Rome by the treaty of 241, but three years later
                    (239), on the invitation of the Carthaginian mercenaries stationed in the
                    islands, a Roman force occupied them; Carthage protested, but, on the Romans
                    threatening war, she gave way, and Sardinia and Corsica were formally ceded to
                    Rome, though it was some seven or eight years before all resistance on the part
                    of the natives themselves was crushed. In 227, however, the senate considered
                    matters ripe for the establishment of a separate administration in her oversea
                    possessions. In that year two additional praetors were elected; to one was
                    assigned the charge of western Sicily, to the other that of Sardinia and
                    Corsica, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="339"> Livy,

                    the Roman provincial system were laid. Of at least equal importance for the
                    security of the peninsula was the subjugation of the Celtic tribes in the valley
                    of the Po. These, headed by the Boii and Insubres and assisted by levies from
                    the Celts to the westward, had in 225 alarmed the whole of Italy by invading
                    Etruria and penetrating to Clusium, only three days’ journey from Rome. Here,
                    however, their courage seems to have failed them. They retreated northward along
                    the Etruscan coast, until at Telamon their way was barred by the Roman legions,
                    returning from Sardinia to the defence of Rome, while a second consular army
                    hung upon their rear. Thus hemmed in, the Celts fought desperately,</p>               <p>but were completely defeated and the flower of their tribesmen slain. The Romans
                    followed up their success by invading the Celtic territory. The Boii were easily
                    reduced to submission. The Insubres, north of the Po, resisted more obstinately,
                    but by 222 the war was over, and all the tribes in the rich Po valley
                    acknowledged the supremacy of Rome. The conquered Celts were not enrolled among
                    the Italian allies of Rome, but were treated as subjects beyond the frontier.
                    Three colonies were founded to hold them in check—Placentia (218) and Cremona in
                    the territory of the Insubres, Mutina (183)* in that of the Boii; and the great
                    northern road (Via Flaminia) was completed as far as the Celtic border at
                    Ariminum.</p>               <p>On the Adriatic coast the immediate interests of Rome were limited to rendering
                    the sea safe for Italian trade. It was with this object that, in 229, the first
                    Roman expedition crossed the Adriatic, and inflicted severe chastisement on the
                    Illyrian pirates of the opposite coast. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    in the Adriatic was of as much importance as to Rome herself. Alliances were
                    concluded with Corcyra, Epidamnus, and ApoIIonia; and embassies explaining the

               <p>of the Romans asserted itself in the face of these crushing misfortunes. In 212
                    Syracuse was recovered; in 211 Capua fell after a long siege which Hannibal
                    failed to raise, even by his famous march up to the gates of Rome, and in the
                    same year a coalition was formed in Greece against</p>               <p>Philip V. of Macedon, which effectually paralysed his offensive action. Hannibal
                    was now confined to Lucania and Bruttium; and his brother Hasdrubal, marching
                    from Spain to join him, was defeated and slain on the river Mctaurus (207). The
                    war in Italy was now virtually ended, for, though during four years more
                    Hannibal stood at bay in a corner of</p>               <p>Bruttium, he was powerless to prevent the restoration of Roman authority
                    throughout the peninsula. Sicily was once more secure; and finally in 206, the
                    year after the victory on the Metaurus, the successes of the young P. Scipio in
                    Spain (2ri-6) were crowned by the complete expulsion of the Carthaginians from
                    the peninsula. On his return from Spain Scipio eagerly urged an immediate
                    invasion of Africa. The senate hesitated; but Scipio gained the day. He was
                    elected consul for 205, and given the province of Sicily, with permission to
                    cross into Africa if he thought fit. Voluntary contributions of men, money, and
                    supplies poured in to the support of the popular hero; and by the end of 205
                    Scipio had collected in Sicily a sufficient force for his purpose. In 204 he
                    crossed to Africa, where he was welcomed by the Numidian prince Massinissa,
                    whose friendship he had made in</p>               <p>Spain. In 203 he twice defeated the Carthaginian forces, and a large party at
                    Carthage were anxious to accept his offer of negotiations. But the advocates of
                    resistance triumphed.</p>               <p>Hannibal was recalled from Italy, and returned to fight his last battle against
                    Rome at Zama, where Scipio, who had been continued in command as proconsul for
                    202 by a special vote of the people, won a complete victory.</p>               <p>The war was over. The Roman assembly voted that the Carthaginian request for
                    peace should be granted, and entrusted the settlement of the terms to Scipio and
                    a commission of ten senators. Carthage was allowed to retain her territory in
                    Africa; but she undertook to wage no wars outside Africa, and none inside
                    without the consent of Rome. She surrendered all her ships but ten triremes, her
                    elephants, and all prisoners of war, and agreed to pay an indemnity of 10,000
                    talents in fifty years. The Numidian Massinissa (g.tf.) was rewarded by an
                    increase of territory, and was enrolled among the “ allies and friends” of the
                    Roman people.</p>               <p>The battle of Zama decided the fate of the West. The power of Carthage was
                    broken and her supremacy passed to Rome.</p>               <p>Henceforth Rome had no rival to fear westward of Italy, and it rested with
                    herself to settle within what limits her supremacy should be confined and what
                    form it should take. For the next fifty years, however, Rome was too deeply
                    involved in the affairs of the East to think of extending her rule far beyond
                    the limits of the rich inheritance which had fallen to her by the defeat of
                    Carthage; but within this area considerable advance was made in the organization
                    and consolidation of her rule. In Sicily and Spain, the immediate establishment
                    of a Roman government was imperatively necessary, if these possessions were not
                    either to fall a prey to internal anarchy, or be recovered for Carthage by some
                    second</p>               <p>Hamilcar. Accordingly, we find that in Sicily the former dominions of Hiero were
                    at once united with the western half of the island as a single province, <note

                    part in the history is limited to its important functions in supplying Rome with

                    more integral part of Italy; and a large proportion even of the land itself
                    passed gradually into the hands of enterprising Roman speculators. The governors
                    of the two Spains had very different work to do from that which fell to the lot
                    of the Sicilian praetors. The condition of Spain required that year after year
                    the praetors should be armed with the consular authority, and backed by a
                    standing force of four legions, while more than once the presence of the consuls
                    themselves was found necessary. Still, in spite of all difficulties, the work of
                    pacification proceeded. To M. Porcius Cato, the censor, and to Tiberius
                    Sempronius Gracchus (praetor and propraetor, 180-79), father of the two
                    tribunes, is mainly due the credit of quieting the Celtiberian tribes of central
                    Spain, and the government of Gracchus was followed by thirty years of
                    comparative tranquillity. The insurrection headed by Viriathus in 149 was
                    largely caused by exactions of the Roman magistrates themselves, while its
                    obstinate continuance down to the capture of Numantia, in 133, was almost as
                    much the result of the incapacity of the Roman commanders. <note anchored="true"

                    speculators flocked to the seaport towns and spread inland. The mines became
                    centres of Roman industry; the Roman legionaries quartered in Spain year after

                    Carthage, bound hand and foot by the treaty of 201, was placed under the jealous
                    watch of the loyal prince of Numidia, who himself willingly acknowledged the
                    suzerainty of Rome. But it was impossible for this arrangement to be permanent.</p>               <p>Every symptom of reviving prosperity at Carthage was regarded at Rome with
                    feverish anxiety, and neither the expulsion of Hannibal in 195 nor his death in
                    183 did much to check the growing conviction that Rome would never be secure
                    while her rival existed. It was therefore with grim satisfaction that many in
                    the Roman senate watched the increasing irritation of the Carthaginians under
                    the harassing raids and encroachments of their favoured neighbour Massinissa,
                    and waited for the moment when Carthage should, by some breach of the conditions
                    imposed upon her, supply Rome with a pretext for interference. At last in 151
                    came the news that Carthage, in defiance of treaty obligations, was actually at
                    war with Massinissa. The anti-Carthaginan party in the senate, headed by M.
                    Porcius Cato, eagerly seized the opportunity, and war was declared, and nothing
                    short of the destruction of their city itself was demanded from the despairing
                    Carthaginians. The demand was refused, and in 149 the siege of Carthage begun.

                    Africa. In the next year (146) Carthage was taken and razed to the ground. Its
                    territory became the Roman province of Africa, while Numidia, now ruled by the
                    three sons of Massinissa, remained as an allied state under Roman suzerainty,
                    and served to protect the new province against the raids of the desert tribes
                    (see</p>               <p>                   <hi rend="smallcaps">Carthage).</hi>
               </p>               <p>In Italy itself the Hannibalic war had been followed by important changes. In
                    the north the Celtic tribes paid for their sympathy with Hannibal by the final
                    loss of all separate political existence. Cispadane Gaul, studded with colonies
                    and flooded with Roman settlers, was rapidly Romanized. Beyond the Padus (Po) in
                    Polybius’s time Roman civilization was already widely spread. In the extreme
                    northeast the Latin colony of Aquileia, the last of its kind, was founded in
                    181, to control the Alpine tribes, while in the north-west the Ligurians were
                    held in check by the colony of Luna (180), and by the extensive settlements of
                    Roman citizens and Latins made on Ligurian territory in 173. <note

                    Eastern states. With one of the three great powers which had divided between
                    them the empire of Alexander, with Egypt, she had formed an alliance in 273, and
                    the alliance had been cemented by the growth of commercial intercourse between
                    the two countries. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="352"

                    naturally enough to the establishment of friendly relations with some of the
                    states of Greece proper. In 214 the alliance between Philip V. and Hannibal, and
                    the former’s threatened attack on Italy, forced her into war with Macedon, at
                    the head of a coalition of the Greek states against him, which effectually
                    frustrated his designs against herself; at the first opportunity, however (205),
                    she ended the war by a peace which left the position unchanged. The results of
                    the war were not only to draw closer the ties which bound Rome to the Greek
                    states, but to inspire the senate with a genuine dread of Philip’s restless
                    ambition, and with a bitter resentment against him for his union with Hannibal.
                    The</p>               <p>events of the next four years served to deepen both these feelings. In 205
                    Philip entered into a compact with Antiochus III. of Syria for the partition
                    between them of the dominions of Egypt, <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial" n="353"> Polyb. iii. 2, xv. 20; Livy xxxi. 14. </note> now
                    left by the death of Ptolemy Philopator to the rule of a boy-king. Antiochus was
                    to take Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, while Philip claimed for his share the
                    districts subject to Egypt on the coasts of the Aegean and the Greek islands.
                    Philip no doubt hoped to be able to secure these unlawful acquisitions before
                    the close of the Second Punic War should set Rome free to interfere with his
                    plans. But the obstinate resistance offered by Attalus of Pergamum and the
                    Rhodians upset his calculations. In 201 Rome made peace with Carthage, and the
                    senate had leisure to listen to the urgent appeal for assistance which reached
                    her from her Eastern allies. With Antiochus indeed the senate was not yet
                    prepared to quarrel; but with Philip the senate had no thoughts of a peaceful
                    settlement. Their animosity against him has been deepened by the assistance he
                    had recently rendered to Carthage. Always an unsafe and turbulent neighbour, he
                    would, if allowed to become supreme in the Aegean, prove as dangerous to her
                    interests in the East as Carthage had been in the West. To cripple or at least
                    to stay the growth of Philip’s power was in the eyes of the senate a necessity;
                    but it was only by representing a Macedonian invasion of Italy as imminent that
                    they persuaded the assembly, which was longing for peace, to pass a declaration
                    of war <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="354"> Ibid.

                    legions in Epirus was not followed, as had been hoped, by any general rising
                    against Philip, yet the latter had soon to discover that, if they were not
                    enthusiastic for Rome, they were still less inclined actively to assist himself.
                    Neither by force nor by diplomacy could he make any progress south of Boeotia.
                    The fleets of Pergamum and Rhodes, now the zealous allies of Rome, protected
                    Attica and watched the eastern coasts. The Achaeans and Nabis of Sparta were
                    obstinately neutral, while nearer home in the north the Epirots and Aetolians
                    threatened Thessaly and Macedonia. His own resources both in men and in money
                    had been severely strained by his constant wars, <note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial" n="355"> Ibid. xxxiii. 3. </note> and the
                    only ally who could have given him effective assistance, Antiochus, was fully
                    occupied with the conquest of Coele-Syria. It is no wonder then that, in spite
                    of his dashing generalship and high courage, he made but a brief stand. T.
                    Quinctius Flamininus (consul 198), in his first year of command, defeated him on
                    the Aous, drove him back to the pass of Tempe, and in the next year utterly
                    routed him at Cynoscephalae. Almost at the same moment the Achaeans, who had now
                    joined Rome, took Corinth, and the Rhodians defeated his troops in Caria. <note

                    Further resistance was impossible; Philip submitted, and early the next year a
                    Roman commission reached Greece with instructions to arrange terms of peace.
                    These were such as effectually secured Rome’s main object in the war, the
                    removal of all danger to herself and her allies from Macedonian aggression.

               <p>sympathy with the Greeks and reverence for their past. It is equally clear that
                    no other course was open to them. For Rome to have annexed Greece, as she had
                    annexed Sicily and Spain, would have been a flagrant violation of the pledges
                    she had repeatedly given both before and during the war; the attempt would have
                    excited the fiercest opposition, and would probably have thrown the Asiatic as
                    well as the European Greeks into the arms of Antiochus. But a friendly and
                    independent Greece would be at once a check on Macedon, a barrier against
                    aggression from the East, and a promising field for Roman commerce. Nor while
                    liberating the Greeks did Rome abstain from such arrangements as seemed
                    necessary to secure the predominance of her own influence. In the Peloponnese,
                    for instance, the Achaeans were rewarded by considerable accessions of

                    dominions of their common rival, Egypt, returned from the conquest of
                    Cocle-Syria (198) to learn first of all that Philip was hard pressed by the
                    Romans, and shortly afterwards that he had been decisively beaten at
                    Cynoscephalae. It was already too late to assist his former ally, but Antiochus
                    resolved at any rate to lose no time in securing for himself the possessions of
                    the Ptolemies in Asia Minor and in eastern Thrace, which Philip had claimed, and
                    which Rome now pronounced free and independent. In 197-96 he overran Asia
                    Minorand crossed into Thrace. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Antiochus was pleasure-loving, irresolute, and no general, and it was not until
                    192 that the urgent entreaties of the Aetolians, and the withdrawal of the Roman
                    troops from Greece, nerved him to the decisive step of crossing the Aegean; even
                    then the force he took with him was so small as to show that he completely

                    Aetolians, he frittered away valuable time between his pleasures at Chalcis and
                    useless attacks on petty Thessalian towns. In 191 Glabrio landed at the head of
                    an imposing force; and a single battle at Thermopylae broke the courage of
                    Antiochus, who hastily recrossed the sea to Ephesus, leaving his Aetolian allies
                    to their fate. But Rome could not pause here. The safety of her faithful allies,
                    the Pergamenes and Rhodians, and of the Greek cities in Asia Minor, as well as
                    the necessity of chastising Antiochus, demanded an invasion of Asia. A Roman
                    fleet had already (191) crossed the Aegean, and in concert with the fleets of
                    Pergamumand Rhodes worsted the navy of Antiochus. In 190 the new consul L.
                    Scipio, accompanied by his famous brother, the conqueror of Africa, led the
                    Roman legion for the first time into Asia. At Magnesia ad Sipylum, in Lydia, he
                    met and defeated the motley and ill-disciplined hosts of the great king. <note

                    East, and the struggle began which lasted far on into the days of the emperors.
                    The terms of the peace which followed the victory at Magnesia tell their own
                    story clearly enough. There is no question, any more than in Greece, of
                    annexation; the main object in view is that of securing the predominance of
                    Roman interests and influence</p>               <p>throughout the peninsula of Asia Minor, and removing to a safe distance the only
                    eastern power which could be considered dangerous. <note anchored="true"

                    natural boundary of the peninsula eastward, was established as the boundary
                    between Antiochus and the kingdoms, cities and peoples now enrolled as the
                    allies and friends of Rome. This line Antiochus was forbidden to cross; nor was
                    he to send ships of war farther west than Cape Sarpedon in Cilicia. Immediately
                    to the west of this frontier lay Bithynia, Paphlagonia and the immigrant Celtic
                    Galatae, and these frontier states, now the allies of Rome, served as a second
                    line of defence against attacks from the east. The area lying between these “
                    buffer states ” and the Aegean was organized by Rome in such a way as should at
                    once reward the fidelity of her allies and secure both her own paramount
                    authority and safety from foreign attack. Pergamum and Rhodes were so
                    strengthened—the former by the gift of the Chersonese, Lycaonia,Phrygia, Mysia
                    and Lydia, the latter by that of Lycia and Caria—as not only amply to reward
                    their loyalty, but to constitute them effective props of Roman interests and
                    effective barriers alike against Thracian and Celtic raids in the north and
                    Syrian aggression in the south. Lastly, the Greek cities on the coast, except
                    those already tributary to Pergamum, were declared free, and established as
                    independent allies of Rome.</p>               <p>In a space of little over eleven years (200-189)</p>               <p>Rome had broken the power of Alexander’s successors and established throughout
                    the eastern Mediterranean a Roman protectorate.</p>               <p>It was in the western half of this protectorate that the first steps in the
                    direction of annexation were taken. The enthusiasm provoked by the liberation of
                    the Greeks had died away, and its place had been taken by feelings of
                    dissatisfied ambition or sullen resentment. Internecine feuds and economic
                    distress had brought many parts of Greece to the verge of anarchy, and, above
                    all, the very foundations of the settlement effected in 197 were threatened by
                    the reviving power and aspirations of Macedon. Loyally as Philip had aided Rome
                    in the war with Antiochus, the peace of Magnesia brought him nothing but fresh
                    humiliation. He was forced to abandon all hopes of recovering Thessaly, and he
                    had the mortification to see the hated king of Pergamum installed almost on his
                    borders as master of the Thracian Chersonese. Resistance at the time was
                    unavailing, but from 189 until his death (179) he laboured patiently and quietly
                    to increase the internal resources of his own kingdom, <note anchored="true"

                    foment, by dexterous intrigue, feelings of hostility to Rome among his Greek and
                    barbarian neighbours. His successor, Perseus, his son by a left-handed alliance,
                    continued his father’s work. He made friends among the Illyrian and Thracian
                    princes, connected himself by marriage with Antiochus IV. of Syria and with
                    Prusias of Bithynia, and, among the Greek peoples, strove, not without success,
                    to revive the memories of the past glories of Greece under the Macedonian
                    leadership of the great Alexander. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of Perseus’s intrigues and preparations, they declared war. <note

                    assumed by Rome, instantly evaporated on the news that the Roman legions were on

                    only allies were the Thracian king Cotys and the Illyrian Genthius. The victory

                    status of the Greek states had been made by Rome. The senate, though forced year
                    after year to listen to the mutual recriminations and complaints of rival
                    communities and factions, contented itself as a rule with intervening just
                    enough to remind the Greeks that their freedom was limited by its own paramount
                    authority, and to prevent any single state or confederacy from raising itself
                    too far above the level of general weakness which it was the interest of Rome to
                    maintain. After the victory at Pydna, however, the sympathy shown for Perseus,
                    exaggerated as it seems to have been by the interested representations of the
                    romanizing factions in the various states, was made the pretext for a more
                    emphatic assertion of Roman ascendancy. All those suspected of Macedonian
                    leanings were removed to’ Italy, as hostages for the loyalty of their several
                    communities, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="376"> Livy
                        xlv. 31. </note> and the real motive for the step was made clear by the
                    exceptionally severe treatment of* the Achacans, whose loyalty was not really
                    doubtful, but whose growing power in the Pelopon-ncse and independence of
                    language had awakened alarm at Rome. A thousand of their leading men, among them
                    the historian Polybius, were carried off to Italy (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Polybius).</hi> In Aetolia the Romans connived at the massacre by their
                    so-called friends of five hundred of the opposite party. Acarnania was weakened
                    by the loss of Leucas, while Athens was rewarded for her unambitious loyalty by
                    the gift of Delos and</p>               <p>Samos.</p>               <p>But this somewhat violent experiment only answered for a time. In 148 the
                    Achaeans rashly persisted, in spite of warnings, in attempting to compel Sparta
                    by force of arms to submit to the league. When threatened by Rome with the loss
                    of all that they had gained since Cynoscephalae, they madly rushed into war.

                    pursued towards Macedon and the Achacans was applied with less justice to Rome’s
                    two faithful and favoured allies, Rhodes and Pergamum. The former had rendered
                    themselves obnoxious to Rome by their independent tone and still more by their

                    short-sighted acquiescence of Rome in the raids of the Cretan pirates. With

                    successful; but this was enough. His brother Attalus was invited, but in vain,
                    to become his rival. His turbulent neighbours, the Galatae, were encouraged to
                    harass him by raids. Pam-phylia was declared independent, and favours were
                    heaped upon Prusias of Bithynia. These and other annoyances and humiliations had
                    the desired effect. Eumenes and his two successors —his brother and son, Attalus
                    II. and Attalus III.—contrived indeed by studious humility and dexterous

                    increased the prevalent disorder in Asia Minor. During the same period we have
                    other indications of a temporary activity on the part of Rome. The frontier of
                    the protectorate was pushed forward to the confines of Armenia by alliances with
                    the kings of Pontus and Cappadocia beyond the Halys. In Syria, on the death of
                    Antiochus Epiphanes (164), Rome intervened to place a minor, Antiochus Eupator,
                    on the throne, under Roman guardianship. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Rome, but her relations with the two were from the first different. The West
                    fell to her as the prize of victory over Carthage, and, the Carthaginian power
                    broken, there was no hindrance to the immediate establishment in Sicily,
                    Sardinia, Spain, and finally in Africa, of direct Roman rule. To the majority,
                    moreover, of her western subjects she brought a civilization as well as a
                    government of a higher type than any before known to them. And so in the West
                    she not only formed provinces but created a new and wider Roman world. To the
                    East, on the contrary, she. came as the liberator of the Greeks; and it was only
                    slowly that in this part of the Empire her provincial system made way. In the
                    East, moreover, the older civilization she found there obstinately held its
                    ground. Her proconsuls governed and her legions protected the Greek communities,
                    but to the last the East remained in language, manners and thought Greek and not

                    could not readily be called together, and when assembled were very imperfectly
                    qualified to decide momentous questions of military strategy and foreign policy.

                    the area of government, increased, some central controlling power became
                    absolutely necessary to prevent collisions between rival authorities, and to
                    secure a proper-division of labour, as well as to enforce the necessary concert

                    rare for any one but a noble to find his way into high office or into the
                    senate. The senate and magistrates arc the mouthpieces of this order, and
                    identified with it in policy and interest. Lastly, it must be allowed that both
                    the senate and the nobility had to some extent justified their power by the use
                    they made of it. It was their tenacity of purpose and devoted patriotism which
                    had carried Rome through the dark days of the Hannibalic War. The heroes of the
                    struggle with Carthage belonged to the leading families; the disasters at the
                    Trasimene Lake and at Cannae were associated with the blunders of popular
                    favourites.</p>               <p>From the first, however, there was an inherent weakness in this senatorial
                    government. It had no sound constitutional basis, and with the removal of its
                    accidental supports it fell to the ground. Legally the senate had no positive
                    authority. It could merely advise the magistrate when asked to do so, and its
                    decrees were strictly only suggestions to the magistrate, which he was at
                    liberty to accept or reject as he chose. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    its failure any longer to govern well. In the East there was confusion; in the

                    efficient substitute, and it was this difficulty that mainly determined the
                    issue of the struggles which convulsed Rome from 3 33 to 49. As the event
                    showed, neither the assembly nor the numerous and disorganized magistracy was
                    equal to the work; the magistrates were gradually pushed aside in favour of a
                    more centralized authority, and the former became only the means by which this
                    new authority was first encouraged in opposition to the senate and finally
                    established in a position of impregnable strength. The assembly which made
                    Pompey and Caesar found out too late that it could not unmake them. .</p>               <p>It is possible that these constitutional and administrative difficulties would
                    not have proved so rapidly fatal to the Republic had not its very foundations
                    been sapped by the changes which followed more or less directly on the conquests
                    of the 3rd and 2nd centuries B.c. For the opening of the world to Rome, and of
                    Rome to the world, produced a radical change in the structure of Roman society.
                    The subjugation of the Mediterranean countries, by placing at the disposal of
                    Rome the vast natural resources of the West and the accumulated treasures of the
                    East, caused a rapid rise in the standard of wealth and a marked change in its
                    distribution. The Roman state was enabled to dispense with the direct taxation
                    of its citizens, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="412">
                        The <hi rend="italic">tributum</hi> was no longer levied after 167 B.c.
                        (Cic. <hi rend="italic">Off.</hi> 11. 22; Plin. <hi rend="italic">H.N.</hi>
                        xxxiii. 56). </note> since it derived all the revenue which it needed from
                    the subject countries. But the wealth drawn from the provinces by the state was
                    trifling in amount compared with that which flowed into the pockets of
                    individual citizens. Not only was the booty taken in war largely appropriated by
                    the Roman commanders and their men, but a host of money-makers settled upon the
                    conquered provinces and exploited them for their profit. The nobles engaged in
                    the task of administration, the contractors <hi rend="italic">(publicani)</hi>
                    who farmed the revenues, and the “ men of business ” <hi rend="italic"
                        >(negotia-tores)</hi> who, as money-lenders, merchants or speculators,
                    penetrated to every corner of the Empire, reaped a rich harvest at the expense
                    of the provincials. Farming in Italy on the old lines became increasingly
                    laborious and unprofitable owing to the importation of foreign corn and foreign
                    slaves, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="413"> See,
                        however, p. 637, note 1 and reff. </note> and capitalists sought easier
                    methods of acquiring wealth. If this had meant that capital was expended in
                    developing the natural resources of the provinces, the result would have been to
                    increase the prosperity of the countries subject to Rome; but it was not so. The
                    Roman <hi rend="italic">negotiatores,</hi> who were often merely the agents of
                    the great families of Rome, drained the accumulated wealth of the provinces by
                    lending mopey to the subject communities at exorbitant rates of interest.
                    Cicero, for example, found when governor of Cilicia that M. Junius Brutus had
                    lent a large sum to the people of Salamis in Cyprus at 48% compound interest;
                    and we cannot suppose that this was an exceptional case. Such practices as
                    these, together with the wasteful and oppressive system of tax-farming, and the
                    deliberate extortions carried on by senatorial governors, reduced the
                    flourishing cities of the Greek East, within the space of two generations, to
                    utter economic exhaustion.</p>               <p>But the reaction of the same process on Rome herself had far more important
                    consequences. The whole structure of Roman society was altered, and the equality
                    and homogeneity which had once been its chief characteristics were destroyed.
                    The Roman nobles had not merely ceased, as in old days, to till their own farms;
                    they had found a means of enriching themselves beyond the dreams of avarice,</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0636" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0681.jp2"/>
               <p>and when they returned from the government of a province it was to build
                    sumptuous villas, filled with the spoils of Greece and Asia, to surround
                    themselves with troops of slaves and dependents, and to live rather as princes
                    than as citizens of a republic. The <hi rend="italic">publicani</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">negotiator cs</hi> formed a second order in the state, which
                    rivalled the first in wealth and coveted a share in its political supremacy;
                    while the third estate, the <hi rend="italic">plebs urbana,</hi> was constantly
                    increasing in numbers and at the same time sinking into the condition of an idle
                    proletariat. The accentuation of class distinctions is indeed inevitable in a
                    capitalist society, such as that of Rome was now becoming. But the process was
                    fraught with grave political danger owing to the peculiarities of the Roman
                    constitution, which rested in theory on the ultimate sovereignty of the people,
                    who were in practice represented by the city mob. To win the support of the <hi
                        rend="italic">plebs</hi> became a necessity for ambitious politicians, and
                    the means employed for this end poisoned the political life of Rome. The wealth
                    derived from the provinces was freely spent in bribery, <note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial" n="414"> From 181 <hi rend="smallcaps"

                        were passed to prevent bribery, but without effect. </note> and the populace
                    of Rome was encouraged to claim as the price of its support a share in the
                    spoils of empire.</p>               <p>It was not only the structure and composition of Roman society that underwent a
                    transformation. The victory of Rome in her struggle for supremacy in the
                    Mediterranean basin had been largely due to the powerful conservative forces by
                    which her institutions were preserved from decay. Respect for the <hi
                        rend="italic">mos majorum,</hi> or ancestral custom, imposed an effective
                    check on the desire for innovation. Though personal religion, in the deeper
                    sense, was foreign to the Roman temperament, there was a genuine belief in the
                    gods whose favour had made Rome great in the past and would uphold her in the
                    future so long as she trod in the old paths of loyalty and devotion. Above all,
                    the healthy moral traditions of early Rome were maintained by the discipline of
                    the family, resting on the supreme authority of the father—the <hi rend="italic"
                        >patria potestas—</hi> and the powerful influence of the mother, to whom the
                    early training of the child was entrusted. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial" n="415"> Cf. Tacitus’s account of Cornelia, the mother of

                    institution of the censorship, backed as it was by the mighty force of public
                    opinion, provided a deterrent which prevented any flagrant deviation from the
                    accepted standard of morals. All this was changed by the influence of Greek
                    civilization, with which Rome was first brought face to face in the 3rd century
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> owing to her relations with Magna Graecia. At
                    first the results of contact with the older and more brilliant culture of Hellas
                    were on the whole good. In the 2nd century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when
                    constant intercourse was established with the communities of Greece proper and
                    of Asia Minor, “ philhellenism ” became a passion, which was strongest in the
                    best minds of the day and resulted in a quickened intellectual activity, wider
                    sympathies and a more humane life. But at the same time the “new learning” was a
                    disturbing and unsettling force. The Roman citizen was confronted with new
                    doctrines in politics and religion, and initiated into the speculations of
                    critical philosophy. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    discipline and Roman traditions of self-effacement, and the craving for
                    individual distinction asserted itself with irresistible vehemence. As it had
                    been in the days of the “ Sophistic ” movement at Athens, so it was now with
                    Rome; a higher education, which, owing to its expense, was necessarily confined
                    to the wealthier classes, interposed between the upper and lower ranks of
                    society a barrier even more effectual than that set up by differences of
                    material condition, and by releasing the individual from the trammels of
                    traditional morality, gave his ambition free course. The effect on private
                    morals may be gauged by the vehemence with which the reactionary opposition,
                    headed by M. Porcius Cato (consul, 195 B.c.; censor, 184 <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    the Hellenistic monarchies, the Roman capitalists proved apt pupils of their
                    Greek teachers. Among the lower classes, contact with foreign slaves and
                    freed-men, with foreign worships and foreign vices, produced a love of novelty
                    which no legislation could check. Even amongst women there were symptoms of
                    revolt against the old order, which showed itself in a growing freedom of
                    manners and impatience of control, <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    which had been so powerful a factor in the maintenance of the Roman standard of
                    morals, was grievously diminished. Thus Rome was at length brought face to face
                    with a moral and economic crisis which a modern historian has described in the
                    words: “ Italy was living through the fever of moral disintegration and
                    incoherence which assails all civilized societies that are rich in the manifold
                    resources of culture and enjoyment, but tolerate few or no restraints on the
                    feverish struggle of contending appetites.” In this struggle the Roman Republic
                    perished, and personal government took its place. The world had outgrown the
                    city-state and its political machinery, and as the notions of federalism (on any
                    large scale) and representative government had not yet come into being, no
                    solution of the problem was possible save that of absolutism. But a far stronger
                    resistance would have been opposed to political revolution by the republican
                    system had not public morals been sapped by the influences above described.

                    failure something will be said later on; for the present we must turn to the
                    constitutional conflict which it provoked. The senate from the first identified
                    itself with the interests of the wealthy occupiers, and Tiberius found himself
                    forced into a struggle with that body, which had been no part of his original
                    plan. He fell back on the legislative sovereignty of the assembly; he
                    resuscitated the half-forgotten powers of interference vested in the tribunate
                    in order to paralyse the action of the senatorial magistrates, and finally lost
                    his life in an attempt to make good one of the weak points in the tribune’s
                    position by securing his own re-election for a second year. But the conflict did
                    not end with bis death. It was</p>               <p>renewed on a wider scale, and with a more deliberate aim by his brother
                    Gaius,who on his election to the tribunate (123) at once came forward as the

                    continued, and the lines on which it was waged were in the main those laid down
                    by Gaius Gracchus. The sovereignty of the assembly continued to be the watchword
                    of the popular party, and a free use of the tribunician powers of interference
                    and of legislation remained the most effective means of accomplishing their

                    had been such as to discredit a stronger government than that of the senate.

                    success by entrusting the command instead to a genuine son of the people. Their
                    choice fell on Gaius Marius (sec Marius), an experienced officer and
                    administrator, but a man of humble birth, wholly illiterate, and one who, though
                    no politician, was by temperament and training a hater of the polished and
                    effeminate nobles who filled the senate. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    now consul for the fifth time, returned to Rome in triumph. There the popular
                    party welcomed him as a leader with all the prestige of a successful general.
                    Once more, however, they were destined to a brief success followed by disastrous
                    defeat. Marius became for the sixth time consul; <note anchored="true"

                    popular leaders Glaucia became praetor and Saturninus tribune. But Marius and
                    his allies were not statesmen of the stamp of the Gracchi; and the laws proposed
                    by Saturninus had evidently no serious aim in view other than that of harassing
                    the senate. His com law merely reduced the price fixed in 123 for the monthly
                    dole of com, and the main point of his agrarian law lay in the clause appended
                    to it requiring all senators to swear to observe its pro</p>               <p>visions. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="458"> For the

                    the popular leaders was short-lived. Their recklessness and violence had
                    alienated all classes in Rome; and their period of office was drawing to a
                    close. At the elections fresh rioting took place, and Marius as consul was
                    called upon by the senate to protect the state against his own partisans.
                    Saturninus and Glaucia surrendered, but while the senate was discussing their
                    fate they were surrounded and murdered by their opponents.</p>               <p>The popular party had been worsted once more in their struggle with the senate,
                    but none the less their alliance with Marius, and the position in which their
                    votes placed him, marked an epoch in* the history of the revolution. The
                    transference of the political leadership to a consul who was nothing if not a
                    soldier was at once a confession of the insufficiency of the purely civil
                    authority of the tribunate and a dangerous encouragement of military
                    interference in political controversies. The consequences were already
                    foreshadowed by the special provisions made by Saturninus for Marius’s veterans,
                    and in the active part taken by them in the passing of his laws. Indirectly,
                    too, Marius, though no politician, played an important part in this new
                    departure. His military reforms <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    attached it more closely to its leader for the time being. He swept away the
                    last traces of civil distinctions of rank or wealth within the legion, admitted
                    to its ranks all classes, and substituted voluntary enlistment under a popular
                    general for the old-fashioned compulsory levy. The efficiency of the legion was
                    increased at the cost of a complete severance of the ties which bound it to the
                    civil community and to the civil authorities.</p>               <p>The next important crisis was due partly to the rivalry which had been growing
                    more bitter each year between the senate and the commercial class, and partly to
                    the long-impending question of the enfranchisement of the Italian allies. The
                        <hi rend="italic">publicani, negotiator es</hi> and others, who constituted
                    what was now becoming known as the equestrian order (see Equites), had made
                    unscrupulous use of their control of the courts and especially of the <hi
                        rend="italic">quaestio de repetundis</hi> against their natural rivals, the
                    official class in the provinces. The threat of prosecution before a hostile jury
                    was held over the head of every governor, legate and quaestor who ventured to
                    interfere with their operations in the provinces. The average official preferred
                    to connive at their exactions; the bolder ones paid with fines and even exile
                    for their courage. In 92 the necessity for a reform was proved beyond a doubt by
                    the scandalous condemnation of P.Rutilius Rufus, <note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial" n="460"> </note> ostensibly on a charge of
                    extortion, in reality as the reward of his efforts to check the extortions of
                    the Roman equites in Asia. The difficulties of the Italian question were more
                    serious. That the Italian allies were discontented was notorious. After nearly
                    two centuries of close alliance, of common dangers and victories, they now
                    eagerly coveted as a boon that complete amalgamation w'ith Rome which they had
                    at first resented as a dishonour. But, unfortunately, Rome had grown more
                    exclusive in proportion as the value set upon Roman citizenship increased.
                    During the last forty years feelings of hope and disappointment had rapidly
                    succeeded each other; Marcus Fulvius Flaccus, Gaius Gracchus, Saturninus, had
                    all held out promises of relief—and nothing had yet been done. On each occasion
                    they had crowded to Rome, full of eager expectation, only to be harshly ejected
                    from the city by the consul’s orders. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    no room in the fierce strife of Roman politics for moderate counsels. His
                    proposal to reform the law courts excited the equestrian order and their friends

                    lost in proclaiming their plans for the future. A new Italian state was to be
                    formed. The Paelignian town of Corfinium was selected as its capital and
                    rechristened with the proud name of Italica. All Italians were to be citizens of
                    this new metropolis, and here were to be the place of assembly and the senate
                    house. A senate of 500 members and a magistracy resembling that of Rome
                    completed a constitution which adhered closely to the very political traditions
                    which its authors had most reason to abjure.</p>               <p>Now, as always in the face of serious danger, the action of Rome was prompt and
                    resolute. Both consuls took the field; <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    five legates, among them the veteran Marius and his destined rival L. Cornelius
                    Sulla, and even freedmen were pressed into service with the legions. But the
                    first year’s campaign opened disastrously. In central Italy the northern
                    Sabellians, and in the south the Samnites, defeated the forces opposed to them.
                    And though before the end of the year Marius and Sulla in the north, and the
                    consul Caesar himself in Campania, succeeded in inflicting severe blows on the
                    enemy, and on the Marsi especially, it is not surprising that, with an empty
                    treasury, with the insurgents’ strength still unbroken, and with rumours of
                    disaffection in the loyal districts, opinion in Rome should have turned in the
                    direction of the more liberal policy which had been so often scornfully rejected
                    and in favour of some compromise which should check the spread of the revolt,
                    and possibly sow discord among their enemies. Towards the close of the year 90
                    the consul L. Julius Caesar (killed by Fimbria in 87) carried the <hi

                    franchise by giving in his name to a praetor in Rome within sixty days. A third
                    law <hi rend="italic">(lex Calpurnia),</hi> apparently passed at the same time,
                    empowered Roman magistrates in the field to bestow the franchise there and then
                    upon all who were willing to receive it. This sudden opening of the closed gates
                    of Roman citizenship was completely successful, and its effects were at once
                    visible in the diminished vigour of the insurgents. By the end of 89 the
                    Samnites and Lucanians were left alone in their obstinate hostility to Rome, and
                    neither, thanks to Sulla’s brilliant campaign in Samnium, had for the moment any

                    proposed—(1) that the command of the Mithradatic war should be given to Marius,
                    (2) that the new citizens should be distributed through all the tribes, (3) that
                    the freedmen should no longer be confined to the four city tribes, (4) that any
                    senator owing more than 2000 denarii should lose his seat, (5) that those exiled
                    on suspicion of complicity with the Italian revolt should be recalled. These
                    proposals inevitably provoked a storm, and both sides were ominously ready for
                    violent measures. The consuls, in order to prevent legislation, proclaimed a
                    public holiday. Sulpicius replied by arming his followers and driving the
                    consuls from the forum. The proclamation was withdrawn and the laws carried, but
                    Sulpicius’s triumph was short-lived. From Nola in Campania, where lay the
                    legions commanded by him in the Social War, Sulla advanced on Rome, and for the
                    first time a Roman consul entered the city at the head of the legions of the
                    Republic. Resistance was hopeless. Marius and Sulpicius fled, <note

                    and the injured dignity of the consulship, and, like Sulla, found them ready to
                    follow where he led. The neighbouring Italian communities, who had lost many
                    citizens in the recent massacre, sent their new champion men and money; <note

                    entry into Rome, came Marius with 1000 Numidian horsemen. The senate had
                    prepared for a desperate defence, but fortune was adverse, and after a brief
                    resistance they gave way. Cinna was acknowledged as consul, the sentence of
                    outlawry passed on Marius was revoked and Cinna and Marius entered Rome with
                    their troops. Marius’s thirst for revenge was gratified by a frightful massacre,
                    and he lived long enough to be nominated consul for the seventh time. But he
                    held his consulship only a few weeks. Early in 86 lie died, and for the next
                    three years Cinna ruled Rome. Constitutional government was virtually suspended.

                    side of the outlawed proconsul. After a winter spent in Campania he pressed
                    forward to Rome, defeated the younger Marius (consul,82) near Praeneste, and
                    entered the city without further opposition. In north Italy the success of his

                    two principal leaders on the other side, Carbo and Norbanus, ,had each fled, one
                    to Rhodes, the other to Africa. Only one foe remained to be conquered. The
                    Samnites and Lucanians whom Cinna had conciliated, and who saw in Sulla their
                    bitterest foe, were for the last time in arms, and had already joined forces
                    with the remains of the Marian army close to Rome. The decisive battle was
                    fought under the walls of the city, and ended in the complete defeat of the

                    strength and the prestige of unbroken success. He stands convicted rather of
                    deliberately aggravating some and culpably ignoring others of the evils he

                    His victory was instantly followed, not by any measures of conciliation, but by
                    a series of massacres, proscriptions and confiscations, of which almost the

                        are known; (1) that a magistrate sent out with the <hi rend="italic"

                        than diminished his freedom of action; (2) that an outgoing governor should
                        leave his province within thirty days after his successor’s arrival (Cic.
                            <hi rend="italic">Ad Fam.</hi> iii. 6. 3). A <hi rend="italic">lex
                            Cornelia de majestate</hi> contained, it is true, a definition of
                        treason evidently framed in the light of recent experience. The magistrate
                        was forbidden “ exire de provincia, educere exercitum, bellum sua sponte
                        gercre, in regnum injussu populi ac senatus accedere,” Cic. <hi
                            rend="italic">Pis.</hi> 21, 50. Sulla also added one to the long list of
                        laws dealing with extortion in the provinces. But the danger lay, not in the
                        want of laws, but in the want of security for their observance by an
                        absolutely autocratic proconsul. The present writer cannot agree with those
                        who would include among Sulla’s laws one retaining consuls and praetors in
                        Rome for their year of office and then sending them out to a province.. This
                        was becoming the common practice before 81. After 81 it is invariable for
                        praetors, as needed for the judicial work, and invariable but for two
                        exceptions in the case of consuls; but nowhere is there a hint that there
                        had been any legislation on the subject, and there are indications that it
                        was convenience and not law which maintained the arrangement. Mommsen, <hi

                    established in 149 for the trial of cases of magisterial extortion in the
                    provinces, and applied between 149 and 8r to cases of treason and bribery, Sulla
                    extended so as to bring under it the chief criminal offences, and thus laid the

                    established—by a successful soldier. It was the fortune of Cn. Pompeius, a
                    favourite officer of Sulla, first of all to violate in his own person the

                    Crassus, in Apulia. In Rome itself the various classes and parties hostile to

                    home and abroad. With the return of Pompey from Spain their opportunity came.
                    Pompey, who understood politics as little as Marius, was anxious to obtain a
                    triumph, the consulship for the next year (70), and as the natural consequence
                    of this an important command in the East. The opposition wanted his name and
                    support, and a bargain was soon struck. Pompey and with him Marcus Licinius
                    Crassus, the real conqueror of Spartacus, were elected consuls, almost in the
                    presence of their troops, which lay encamped outside the gates in readiness to
                    assist at the triumph and ovation granted to their respective leaders. Pompey
                    lost no time in performing his part of the agreement. The tribunes regained

                    with neither of the two great parties in Rome, but with the holder of the
                    military authority. The tribunes ceased to be political leaders and became
                    lieutenants of the military commanders, and the change was fatal to the dignity
                    of politics in the city. Men became conscious of the unreality of the old
                    constitutional controversies, indifferent to the questions which agitated the
                    forum and the curia, and contemptuously ready to alter or disregard the
                    constitution itself when it stood in the way of interests nearer to their
                    hearts.</p>               <p>When his consulship ended, Pompey impatiently awaited at the hands of the
                    politicians he had befriended the further gift of a foreign command. He declined
                    an ordinary province, and from the end of 70 to 67 he remained at Rome in a

                    The interval was marked in Rome by the rise to political importance of Caesar
                    and Cicero, and by Catiline’s attempt at revolution. As the nephew of Marius and
                    the son-in-law of Cinna,</p>               <p>Caesar possessed a strong hereditary claim to the leadership of the popular and

                    law; and, when Pompey’s withdrawal left the field clear for other competitors,
                    he stepped at once into the front rank on the popular side. <note

                        leader from 67 to 63. That this is the inference intentionally conveyed by
                        Sallust, in order to ’ screen Caesar, is true, but the inference is a false
                        one. </note> He took upon himself, as their nearest representative, the task
                    of clearing the memory and avenging the wrongs of the great popular leaders,
                    Marius, Cinna and Satuminus. He publicly reminded the people of Marius’s
                    services, and set up again upon the Capitol the trophies of the Cimbric War. He
                    endeavoured to bring to justice, not only the ringleaders in Sulla’s bloody work
                    of proscription, but even the murderers of Satuminus, and vehemently pleaded the
                    cause of the children of the proscribed. While thus carrying on in genuine Roman
                    fashion the feud of his family, he attracted the sympathies of the Italians by
                    his efforts to procure the Roman franchise for the Latin communities beyond the
                    Po, and won the affections of the populace in Rome and its immediate
                    neighbourhood by the splendour of the games which he gave as curule aedile (65),
                    and by his lavish expenditure upon the improvement of the Appian Way. But these
                    measures were with him only means to the further end of creating for himself a
                    position such as that which Pompey had already won; and this ulterior aim he
                    pursued with an audacious indifference to constitutional forms and usages. His
                    coalition with Crassus, soon after Pompey’s departure, secured him an ally whose
                    colossal wealth and wide financial connexions were of inestimable value, and
                    whose vanity and inferiority of intellect rendered him a* willing tool. The

                    evident that by the beginning of 63 he was bent on reaping the reward of his
                    exertions by obtaining from the people an extraordinary command abroad, which
                    should secure his position before Pompey’s return; and the agrarian law proposed
                    early that year by the tribune P. Servilius Rullus had for its object the
                    creation, in favour of Caesar and Crassus, of a commission with powers so wide

               </p>               <p>Cicero’s election to the consulship for 63 over the heads of Caesar’s nominees,
                    Antonius and Catiline, was mainly the work of the Italian middle class, already
                    rendered uneasy both by the rumours which were rife of revolutionary schemes and
                    of Caesar’s boundless ambition, and by the numerous disquieting signs of
                    disturbance noticeable in Italy. The new consul vigorously set himself to
                    discharge the trust placed in him. He defeated the insidious proposals of Rullus
                    for Caesar’s aggrandizement and assisted in quashing the prosecution of Gaius
                    Rabirius (q.v.). But with the consular elections in the autumn of 63 a fresh
                    danger arose from a different quarter. The “ conspiracy of Catiline” (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Catiline)</hi> was not the work of the popular</p>               <p>party, and Still less was it an unselfish attempt at reform; Catiline himself
                    was a patrician, who had held high office, and possessed considerable ability
                    and courage; but he was bankrupt in character and in purse, and two successive
                    defeats in the consular elections had rendered him desperate. To retrieve his
                    broken fortunes by violence was a course which was only too readily suggested by
                    the history of the last forty years, and materials for a conflagration abounded
                    on all sides. The danger to be feared from his intrigues lay in the state of
                    Italy, which made a revolt against society and the established government only
                    too likely if once a leader presented himself, and it was such a revoIt that
                    Catiline endeavoured to organize. Bankrupt nobles like himself, Sullan veterans
                    and the starving peasants whom they had dispossessed of their holdings, outlaws
                    of every description, the slave population of Rome, and the wilder
                    herdsmen-slaves of the Apulian pastures, were all enlisted under his banner, and
                    attempts were even made to excite disaffection among the newly conquered people
                    of southern Gaul and the warIike tribes who still cherished the memory of
                    Sertorius in Spain. In Etruria, the seat and centre of agrarian distress · and
                    discontent, a rising actually took place headed by a Sullan centurion, but the
                    spread of the revolt was checked by Cicero’s vigorous measures. Catiline fled
                    from Rome, and died fighting with desperate courage at the head of his motley
                    force of old soldiers, peasants and slaves. His accomplices in Rome were
                    arrested, and, after an unavailing protest from Caesar, the senate authorized
                    the consuls summarily to put them to death.</p>               <p>The CatiHnarian outbreak had been a blow to Caesar, whose schemes it
                    interrupted, but to Cicero it brought not only popularity and honour, but, as he
                    beHeved, the realization of his political ideal. But Pompey was now on his way
                    home, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="536"> For the
                        history of the next eighteen years, the most important ancient authority is
                        Cicero in his letters and speeches. </note> and again as in 70 the political
                    future seemed to depend on the attitude which the successful general would
                    assume; Pompey himself looked simply to the attainment by the help of one
                    political party or another of his immediate aims, which at present were the
                    ratification of his arrangements in Asia and a grant of land for his troops.</p>               <p>It was the impracticable jealousy of his personal rivals in the senate, aided by
                    the versatility of Caesar, who presented himself not as his rival but as his
                    ally, which drove Pompey once more, in spite of Cicero’s efforts, into the camp
                    of what was still nominally the popular party. In 60, on Caesar’s return from
                    his propraetorship in Spain, the coalition was formed which is known by the
                    somewhat misleading title of the First Triumvirate. <note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial" n="537"> Misleading, because the coalition
                        was unofficial. The “triumvirs” of 43 were actual magistrates, " Illviri
                        reipublicae constitucndae causa.” </note> Pompey was ostensibly the head of
                    this new alliance, and in return for the satisfaction of his own demands he
                    undertook to support Caesar’s candidature for the consulship. The wealth and
                    influence of Crassus were enlisted in the same cause, and the <hi rend="italic"
                        >publicani</hi> were secured by a promise of release from their bargain for
                    collecting the taxes of Asia. Cicero was under no illusions as to the
                    significance of this coalition. It scattered to the winds his dreams of a stable
                    and conservative republic. The year 59 saw the republic powerless in the hands
                    of three citizens. Caesar as consul procured the ratification of Pompey’s acts
                    in Asia, granted to the <hi rend="italic">publicani.</hi> the relief refused by
                    the senate, and carried an agrarian law of the new type, which provided for the

                    P. Clodius <hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> as tribune brought forward a law
                    enacting that any one who had put a Roman citizen to death without trial by the
                    people should be interdicted from fire and water. Cicero, finding himself
                    deserted even by Pompey,left Rome in a panic, and by a second Clodian law he was
                    declared to be outlawed. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                        which </note> With Caesar away in his province, and Cicero banished, Clodius
                    was for the time master in Rome. But, absolute as he was in the streets, and
                    recklessly as he parodied the policy of the Gracchi by violent attacks on the
                    senate, his tribunate merely illustrated the anarchy which now inevitably
                    followed the withdrawal of a strong controlling hand. A reaction speedily
                    followed. Pompey, bewildered and alarmed by Clodius’s violence, at last
                    bestirred himself. Cicero’s recall was decreed by the senate, and early in
                    August 57 in the <hi rend="italic">comitia centuriata,</hi> to which his Italian
                    supporters flocked in crowds, a law was passed revoking the sentence of outlawry
                    passed upon him.</p>               <p>Intoxicated by the acclamations which greeted him, and encouraged by Pompey’s
                    support, and by the salutary effects of Clodius’s excesses, Cicero’s hopes rose
                    high. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="541"> Cicero’s
                        speech <hi rend="italic">Pro Sestio</hi> gives expression to these feelings;
                        it contains a passionate appeal to all good citizens to rally round the old
                        constitution. The acquittal of Sestius confirmed his hopes. See <hi
                            rend="italic">Ad Q. Fr.</hi> ii. 4. </note> With indefatigable energy he
                    strove to reconstruct a solid constitutional party, hut only to fail once more.
                    Pompey was irritated by the hostility of a powerful section in the senate, who
                    thwarted his desires for a fresh command and even encouraged Clodius in
                    insulting the conqueror of the East. Caesar became alarmed at the reports which
                    reached him that the repeal of his agrarian law was threatened and that the
                    feeling against the coalition was growing in strength; above all, he was anxious
                    for a renewal of his five years’ command. He acted at once, and in the
                    celebrated conference at Luca (56) the alliance of the three self-constituted
                    rulers of Rome was renewed. Cicero succumbed to the inevitable and withdrew in
                    despair from public life.</p>               <p>Pompey and Crassus became consuls for 55. Caesar’s command was renewed for
                    another five years, and to each of his two allies important provinces were
                    assigned for a similar period—Pompey receiving the two Spains and Africa, and
                    Crassus Syria. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="542">

                    between them the control of the empire. For the future.the question was, how
                    long the coalition itself would last. Its duration proved to be short. In 53
                    Crassus was defeated and slain by the Parthians at Carrhae, and in Rome the
                    course of events slowly forced Pompey into an attitude of hostility to Caesar.
                    The year 54 brought with it a renewal of the riotous anarchy which had disgraced
                    Rome in 58-57. Conscious of its own helplessness, the senate, with the eager
                    assent of all respectable citizens, dissuaded Pompey from leaving Italy; and he
                    accordingly left his provinces to be governed by his legates. But the anarchy
                    and confusion only grew worse, and even strict constitutionalists like Cicero
                    talked of the necessity of investing Pompey with some extraordinary powers for
                    the preservation of order. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    preventing his standing for the consulship. Through 51 and 50 the discussions in
                    the senate and the negotiations with Caesar continued, but with no result. On
                    1st January 49 Caesar made a last offer of compromise. The senate replied by
                    requiring him on pain of outlawry to disband his legions. Two tribunes who
                    supported him were ejected from the senate-house, and the magistrates with
                    Pompey were authorized to take measures to protect the republic. Caesar
                    hesitated no longer; he crossed the Rubicon and invaded Italy. The rapidity of
                    his advance astounded and bewildered his foes. Pompey, followed by the consuls,
                    by the majority of the senate and a long train of nobles, abandoned Italy as
                    untenable, and crossed into Greece <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        the sea. Politically, however, it was a blunder, as it enabled Caesar to

                    for there is no sufficient reason to believe that Caesar had long premeditated
                    revolution, or that he had previously aspired to anything more than such a
                    position as that which Pompey had already won, a position unrepublican indeed,

                            Rome,</hi> bk. v. cap. xi.). Too much stress must not be laid on the

                    was forced upon him as the alternative to political suicide, hut success in war
                    brought the responsibilities of nearly absolute power, and Caesar’s genius must
                    be held to have shown itself in the masterly fashion in which he grasped the
                    situation, rather than in the supposed sagacity with which he is said to have
                    foreseen and prepared for it. In so far as he failed, his failure was mainly due
                    to the fact that his tenure of power was too short for the work which he was
                    required to perform. From the very first moment when Pompey’s ignominious
                    retreat left him master of Italy, he made it clear that he was neither a second
                    Sulla nor even the reckless anarchist which many believed him to be. <note

                    denudation and desolation of the country districts. His strong hand carried out

                    large scale were made in Italy; decaying towns were reinforced by fresh drafts
                    of settlers; on the large estates and cattle farms the owners were required to
                    find employment for a certain amount of free labour; and a slight and temporary
                    stimulus was given to Italian industry by the reimposition of harbour dues upon
                    foreign goods. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="557">

                    of the validity of his title to govern at all. But how did Caesar deal with what
                    was after all the greatest problem which he was called upon to solve, the
                    establishment of a satisfactory government for the Empire? One point indeed was
                    already settled. Some centralization of the executive authority was
                    indispensable, and this part of his work Caesar thoroughly performed. From the
                    moment when he seized the moneys in the treasury on his first entry into Rome

                    recognized on other authority but his throughout the Empire. He alone directed
                    the policy of Rome in foreign affairs; the legions were led, and the provinces
                    governed, not by independent magistrates, but by his “legates”; <note

                    precedent he established was closely followed by his successors. It was
                    otherwise with the more difficult question of the form under which this new
                    executive authority should be exercised and the relation it should hold to the
                    republican constitution. We must be content to remain in ignorance of the
                    precise shape which Caesar intended ultimately to give to the new system. The
                    theory that he contemplated a revival of the old Roman kingship <note

                    </note> is supported by little more than the popular gossip of the day, and the
                    form under which he actually wielded his authority can hardly have been regarded
                    by so sagacious a statesman as more than a provisional arrangement. This form
                    was that of the dictatorship; and in favour of the choice it might have been
                    urged that the dictatorship was the office naturally marked out by republican
                    tradition as the one best suited to carry the state safely through a serious
                    crisis, that the powers it conveyed were wide, that it was as dictator that
                    Sulla had reorganized the state, and that a dictatorship had been spoken of as
                    the readiest means of legalizing Pompey’s protectorate of the Republic in 53-52.
                    The choice nevertheless was a bad one. It was associated with those very Sullan
                    traditions from which Caesar was most anxious to sever himself; it implied
                    necessarily the suspension for the time of all constitutional government; and,
                    lastly, the dictatorship as held by Caesar could not even plead that it
                    conformed to the old rules and traditions of the office. The “ perpetual
                    dictatorship ” granted him after his crowning victory at Munda (45) was a
                    contradiction in terms and a repudiation of constitutional government which
                    excited the bitterest animosity. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

               </p>               <p>A second question, hardly less important, was that of the position to be
                    assigned to the old constitution. So far as Caesar himself was concerned, the
                    answer was for the time sufficiently dear. The old constitution was not formally
                    abrogated. The senate met and deliberated; the assembly passed laws and elected
                    magistrates; there were still consuls, praetors, aediles, quaestors and
                    tribunes; and Caesar himself, like his successors, professed to hold his
                    authority by the will of the people. But senate, assembly and magistrates were
                    all alike subordinated to the paramount authority of the dictator; and this
                    subordination was, in appearance at least, more direct and complete under the
                    rule of Caesar than under that of Augustus. Caesar was by nature as impatient as
                    Augustus was tolerant of established forms; and, dazzled by the splendour of his
                    career of victory and by his ubiquitous energy and versatility, the Roman
                    public, high and low, prostrated themselves before him and heaped honours upon
                    him with a reckless profusion which made the existence of any authority by the
                    side of his own an absurdity. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Hence under Caesar the old constitution was repeatedly disregarded, or suspended
                    in a way which contrasted unfavourably with the more respectful attitude assumed
                    by Augustus. For months together Rome was left without any regular magistrates,
                    and was governed like a subject town by Caesar’s prefects. <note anchored="true"

                    But, though Caesar's high-handed conduct in this respect was not imitated by his
                    immediate successors, yet the main lines of their policy were laid down by him.
                    These were—(1) the municipalization of the old republican constitution, and (2)
                    its subordination to the paramount authority of the master of the legions and
                    the provinces. In the first case he only carried further a change already in
                    progress. Of late years the senate had been rapidly losing its hold over the
                    Empire at large. Even the ordinary proconsuls were virtually independent
                    potentates, ruling their provinces as they chose, and disposing absolutely of
                    legions which recognized no authority but theirs. The consuls and praetors of
                    each year had since 81 been stationed in Rome, and immersed in purely municipal
                    business; and, lastly, since the enfranchisement of Italy, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >comitia,</hi> though still recognized as the ultimate source of all
                    authority, had become little more than assemblies of the city populace, and
                    their claim to represent the t/ue Roman people was indignantly questioned, even
                    by republicans like</p>               <p>Cicero. The concentration in Caesar’s hands of all authority outside Rome
                    completely and finally severed all real connexion between the old institutions
                    of the Republic of Rome and the government of the Roman Empire. But the
                    institutions of the Republic not merely became, what they had originally been,
                    the local institutions of the city of Rome; they were also subordinated even
                    within these narrow limits to the paramount authority of the man who held in his
                    hands the army and the provinces. Autocratic abroad, at home he was the chief
                    magistrate of the commonwealth; and this position was marked, in his case as in
                    that of those who followed him, by a combination in his person of various
                    powers, and by a general right of precedence which left no limits to his
                    authority but such as he chose to impose upon himself. During the greater part
                    of his reign he was consul as well as dictator. In 48, after his victory at
                    Pharsalia, he was given the <hi rend="italic">tribunicia poteslas</hi> for life,

               </p>               <p>For a moment, in spite of the menacing attitude of Caesar’s self-constituted
                    representative Marcus Antonius (Mark Antony), it seemed to one man at least as
                    if the restoration of republican government was possible. With indefatigable
                    energy Cicero strove to enlist the senate, the people, and above all the
                    provincial governors in support of the old constitution. But, though his
                    eloquence now and again carried all before it in senate-house and forum, it was
                    powerless to alter the course of events. By the beginning of 43 civil war had
                    recommenced; in the autumn Antony was already threatening an invasion of Italy
                    at the head of seventeen legions. Towards the end of October Antony and his ally
                    M. Aemilius Lepidus coalesced with the young Octavian, who had been recently
                    elected consul at the age of twenty, in spite of senatorial opposition; and the
                    coalition was legalized by the creation of the extraordinary commission for the
                    “ reorganization of the commonwealth” known as the “Second Triumvirate.” <note

                    the West; while Lepidus was forced to content himself with Africa. <note

                    consolidating his power. Lepidus his fellow-triumvir was in 36 ejected from
                    Africa and banished to Circeii, while Sextus Pompeius, who had since his defeat
                    at Munda maintained a semi-piratical ascendancy in the western Mediterranean,
                    was decisively defeated in the same year, and his death in 35 left Octavian sole
                    master of the West. The inevitable trial of strength between himself and Antony
                    was not long delayed. In 32 Antony openly challenged the hostility of Octavian
                    by divorcing Octavia in favour of the beautiful and daring Egyptian princess,
                    with whom, as the heiress of the Ptolemies, he aspired to share the empire of
                    the Eastern world. By a decree of the senate Antony was declared deposed from
                    his command, and war was declared against Queen Cleopatra. <note anchored="true"

                    constitution. Augustus could say with truth that he had accepted no office which

                    that he took precedence of his colleagues. Nevertheless, as every thinking man
                    must have realized, the compromise was unreal, and its significance was
                    ambiguous. It was an arrangement avowedly of an exceptional and temporary
                    character, yet no one could suppose that it would in effect be otherwise than
                    permanent. The powers voted to Augustus were (like those conferred upon</p>               <p>Pompey in 67 B.c.) voted only to him, and (save the <hi rend="italic">tribunicia

                    way the powers of the principate were made coextensive in time with the life of

                    of succession, and various expedients were devised in order to indicate the

                    would naturally be bestowed after the death of his stepfather. But succeeding
                    emperors did not always indicate their successors so clearly, and, in direct

                    magistrate became increasingly unequal. Over the provinces the <hi rend="italic"
                        >princeps</hi> from the first ruled autocratically; and this autocracy
                    reacted upon his position in Rome, so that it became every year more difficult
                    for a ruler so absolute abroad to maintain even the fiction of republican
                    government at home. The republican institutions, with the partial exception of
                    the senate, lose all semblance of authority outside Rome, and even as the
                    municipal institutions of the chief city of the empire they retain but little
                    actual power. The real government even of Rome passes gradually into the hands
                    of imperial prefects and commissioners, and the old magistracies become merely
                    decorations which the emperor bestows at his pleasure. At the same time the rule
                    of the <hi rend="italic">princeps</hi> assumes an increasingly personal
                    character, and the whole work of government is silently concentrated in his
                    hands and in those of his own subordinates. Closely connected with this change
                    is the different aspect presented by the history of the empire in Rome and Italy
                    on the one hand and in the provinces on the other. Rome and Italy share in the
                    decline of the republic. Political independence and activity die out; their old
                    pre-eminence and exclusive privileges gradually disappear; and at the same time
                    the weight of the overwhelming power of the <hi rend="italic">princeps,</hi> and
                    the abuses of their power by individual <hi rend="italic">principes,</hi> press
                    most heavily upon them. On the other hand, in the provinces and on the
                    frontiers, where the imperial system was most needed, and where from the first
                    it had full play, it is seen at its best as developing or protecting an orderly
                    civilization and maintaining the peace of the world.</p>               <p>The decay of the republican institutions had commenced before the revolutionary
                    crisis of 49. It was accelerated bv the virtual suspension of regular government
                    between 49 and 28; and not even the diplomatic deference towards ancient forms
                    which Augustus displayed availed to conceal the unreality of his work of
                    restoration. The <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi> received back from him “ their
                    ancient rights ” (Suet. <hi rend="italic">Aug.</hi> 40), and during his lifetime
                    they continued to pass law’s and to elect magistrates. But after the end of the
                    reign of Tiberius we have only two instances of legislation by the assembly in
                    the ordinary way, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="617">

                    empire is performed either by decrees of the senate or by imperial edicts and
                    constitutions. Their prerogative- of electing magistrates was, even under
                    Augustus, robbed of most of its importance by the control which the <hi
                        rend="italic">princeps</hi> exercised over their choice by means of his
                    rights of nomination and commendation, which effectually secured the election of

                    this restricted prerogative was still further curtailed. The candidates for all
                    magistracies except the consulship were thenceforward nominated and voted for in
                    the senate-house and by the senators, <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        The magistracy directly referred to is the praetorship, but that the change
                        affected the lower magistracies also is certain; see, <hi rend="italic"

                    (re»««/ia//o) took place in the assembly (Dio lviii. 20). And, though the
                    election of consuls was never thus transferred to the senate, the process of
                    voting seems to have been silently abandoned. In the time of the younger Pliny

               <p>This almost complete effacement of the <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi> was
                    largely due to the fact that they had ceased to represent anything but the
                    populace of Rome, and the comparatively greater vitality shown by the old
                    magistracies is mainly attributable to the value they continued to possess in
                    the eyes of the Roman upper class. But, though they were eagerly sought (Plin.
                        <hi rend="italic">Epp.</hi> ii. 9, vi. 6), and conferred on their holders
                    considerable social distinction, the magistrates ceased, except in name, to be
                    the popularly chosen executive officers of the Roman state. In the
                    administration of the empire at large they had no share, if we except the
                    subordinate duties still assigned to the quaestor in a province. In Rome, to
                    which their sphere of work was limited, they were overshadowed by the dominant
                    authority of the <hi rend="italic">princeps,</hi> while their range of duties
                    was increasingly circumscribed by the gradual transference of administrative
                    authority, even within the city, to the emperor and his subordinate officials.
                    And their dependence on the <hi rend="italic">princeps</hi> was confirmed by the
                    control he exercised over their appointment. For all candidates the approval, if
                    not the commendation, of the <hi rend="italic">princeps</hi> became the
                    indispensable condition of success, and the <hi rend="italic">princeps</hi> on
                    his side treated these ancient offices as pieces of preferment with which to
                    reward his adherents or gratify the ambition of Roman nobles. The dignity of the
                    office, too, was impaired by the practice* begun by Caesar and continued by
                    Augustus and his successors, of granting the insignia to men who had not held
                    the actual magistracy itself. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    traditions were some guarantee for their independence. But this element soon

                    in the 3rd century, were men of wealth and mark, but many more were of low
                    birth, on some rested the stain of a servile descent, and all owed alike their

                    was of necessity gradual; but it had its beginnings under Augustus, who formed
                    the equestrian order (admission to which was henceforth granted only by him)
                    into an imperial service, partly civil and partly military, whose members, being
                    immediately dependent on the emperor, could be employed on tasks which it would
                    have heen impossible to assign to senators (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Equites).</hi> From this order were drawn the armies of “ procurators ”—the

                    administered the imperial revenues and properties in all parts of the empire.
                    Merit was rewarded by independent governorships such as those of Raetia and
                    Noricum, or the command of the naval squadrons at Misenum and Ravenna; and the
                    prizes of the knight’s career were the prefectures of the praetorian guard, the
                    corn-supply and the city police, and the governorship of Egypt. The household

                    society, but was turned to account by the statecraft of Augustus to develop
                    something like an imperial patriotism. The official worship of the deified
                    Caesar, starting from that of the “ divine Julius,” gave a certain sanctity and
                    continuity to the regular succession of the emperors, but it was of less
                    importance politically than the worship of “ Rome and Augustus,” first
                    instituted in Asia Minor in 29 B.C., and gradually diffused
                    throughout the provinces, as a symbol of imperial unity. It must be observed
                    that living emperors were not officially worshipped by Roman citizens; yet we

               </p>               <p>On the accession of Augustus, there could be little doubt as to the nature of
                    the work that was necessary, if peace and prosperity were to be secured for the
                    Roman world. He was called upon to justify his position by rectifying the
                    frontiers and strengthening their defences, by reforming the system of
                    provincial government, and hy reorganizing the finance; and his success in
                    dealing with these three difficult problems is sufficiently proved hy the
                    prosperous condition of the empire for a century and a half after his death. To
                    secure peace it was necessary to establish on all sides of the empire really
                    defensible frontiers; and this became possible now that for the first time the
                    direction of the foreign policy of the state and of its military forces was
                    concentrated in the hands of a single magistrate. To the south and west the
                    generals of the republic, and Caesar himself, had extended the authority of Rome
                    to the natural boundaries formed by the African deserts and the Atlantic Ocean,
                    and in these two directions Augustus’s task was in the main confined to the
                    organization of a settled Roman government within these limits. In Africa the
                    client state of Egypt was ruled by Augustus as the successor of the Ptolemies,
                    and administered by his deputies <hi rend="italic">(praefccti),</hi> and'the
                    kingdom of Numidia (25 B.c.) was incorporated with the old
                    province of Africa. In Spain the hill-tribes of the north-west were finally
                    subdued and a third province, Lusitania, established. <note anchored="true"

                    running from the Euxine to the North Sea, and covering the peaceful districts to

                    Raetia (15 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> and Gallia Belgica. Roman rule was
                    thus carried up to the natural frontier lines of the Rhine and the Danube. It
                    was originally intended to make the Elbe the frontier of the empire; but after
                    the defeat of P. Quintilius Varus <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 9) the forward
                    policy was abandoned. Tiberius recalled Germanicus as soon as Varus had been
                    avenged; and after the peace with Maroboduus, the chief of the Marcomanni on the
                    upper Danube, in the next year <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 17), the
                    defensive policy recommended by Augustus was adopted along the whole of the
                    northern frontier. The line of the great rivers was held by an imposing mass of
                    troops. Along the Rhine lay the armies of tipper and Lower Germany, consisting
                    of four legions each; eight more guarded the Danube and the frontiers of
                    Pannonia and Moesia. At frequent intervals along the frontier were the military
                    colonies, the permanent camps and the smaller intervening <hi rend="italic"
                        >castella.</hi> Flotillas of galleys cruised up and down the rivers, and
                    Roman roads opened communication both along the frontiers and with the seat of
                    government in Italy.</p>               <p>In the East, Rome was confronted with a w’ell-organized and powerful state whose
                    claims to empire were second only to her own. The victory of Carrhae (53 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> had encouraged among the Parthians the idea of
                    an invasion of Syria and Asia Minor, while it had awakened in Rome a genuine
                    fear of the formidable power which had so suddenly arisen in the East. Caesar
                    was at the moment of his death preparing to avenge the death of Crassus by an
                    invasion of Parthia, and Antony’s schemes of founding an Eastern empire which
                    should rival that of Alexander included the conquest of the kingdom beyond the
                    Euphrates. Augustus, however, adhered to the policy which he recommended to his
                    successors of “ keeping the empire within its bounds ”; and the Parthians,
                    weakened by internal feuds and dynastic quarrels, were in no mood for vigorous
                    action. Roman pride was satisfied by the restoration of the standards taken at
                    Carrhae. Four legions guarded the line of the Euphrates, and, beyond the
                    frontiers of Pontus and</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0651" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0698.jp2"/>

                        to be a debatable ground between Rome and Parthia—passing alternately under

               </p>               <p>Next in importance to the rectification and defence of the frontiers was the
                    reformation of the administration, and the restoration of prosperity to the
                    distracted and exhausted provinces. The most serious defect of the republican
                    system had been the absence of any effective control over the Roman officials
                    outside Italy. This was now supplied by the general proconsular authority vested
                    in the emperor. The provinces were for the first time treated as departments of
                    a single state, while their governors, from being independent and virtually
                    irresponsible rulers, became the subordinate officials of a higher authority.

                    responsible to him for their conduct. The proconsuls of the senatorial provinces
                    were in law magistrates equally with the <hi rend="italic">princcps,</hi> though
                    inferior to him in rank; it was to the senate that they were as of old
                    responsible; they were still selected by lot from among the senators of consular
                    and praetorian rank. But the distinction did not seriously interfere with the
                    paramount authority of the emperor. The provinces left nominally to the senate
                    were the more peaceful and settled districts in the heart of the empire, where
                    only the routine work of civil administration was needed, and where the local
                    municipal governments were as yet comparatively vigorous. The senatorial
                    proconsuls themselves were indirectly nominated by the emperor through his
                    control of the praetorship and consulship. They wielded no military and only a
                    strictly subordinate financial authority, and, though Augustus and Tiberius, at
                    any rate, encouraged the fiction of the responsibility of the senatorial
                    governors to the senate, it was in reality to the emperor that they looked for
                    direction and advice, and to him that they were held accountable. Moreover, in
                    the case of all governors this accountability became under the empire a reality.

                    during the first century of the empire; but a more effective check on
                    maladministration lay in the appeal to Caesar from the decisions of any
                    governor, which was open to every provincial, and in the right of petition.
                    Finally, the authority both of the legate and the proconsul was weakened by the
                    presence of the imperial procurator, to whom was entrusted the administration of
                    the fiscal revenues; while both legate and proconsul were deprived of that right
                    of requisitioning supplies which, in spite of a long series of restrictive laws,
                    had been the most powerful instrument of oppression in the hands of republican
                    governors.</p>               <p>The financial reforms of Augustus <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    same desire to establish an equitable, orderly and economical system, and by the
                    same centralization of authority in the emperor’s hands. The institution of an
                    imperial census, or valuation of all land throughout the empire, and the
                    assessment upon this basis of a uniform land tax, in place of the heterogeneous
                    and irregular payments made under the republic, were the work of Augustus,
                    though the system was developed and perfected by the emperors of the 2nd century
                    and by Diocletian. The land tax itself was directly collected, either by
                    imperial officials or by local authorities responsible to them, and the old
                    wasteful plan of selling the privilege of collection to <hi rend="italic"
                        >publicani</hi> was henceforward applied only to such indirect taxes as the
                    customs duties. The rate of the land tax was fixed by the emperor, and with him
                    rested the power of remission even in senatorial provinces. <note

                    difficulties, and the provinces exhausted and impoverished. Under the emperors,
                    at least throughout the 1st century, in spite of a largely increased expenditure
                    on the army, on public works, on shows and largesses, and on the machinery of
                    government itself, the better emperors, such as Tiberius and Vespasian, were
                    able to accumulate large sums, while the provinces show but few signs of
                    distress. Moreover, while the republic had almost entirely neglected to develop
                    the internal resources of the provinces,</p>               <p>Augustus set the example of a liberal expenditure on public works, in the
                    construction of harbours, roads and bridges, the reclamation of waste lands, and
                    the erection of public buildings. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    empire. In the eyes of the republican statesmen the provinces were merely the
                    estates of the Roman people, but from the reign of Augustus dates the gradual
                    disappearance of the old pre-eminence of Rome and Italy. It was from the
                    provinces that the legions were increasingly recruited; provincials rose to high
                    rank as soldiers, statesmen and men of letters; <note anchored="true"

                    husbanded the finances of the empire, but he became intensely unpopular in Roman
                    society, and was painted as a cruel and odious tyrant. His successor, Gaius <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 37-41), generally known as Caligula, was the
                    slave of his wild caprices and uncontrolled passions, which issued in manifest
                    insanity. He was followed by bis uncle, Claudius <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi>
                    41-54), whose personal uncouthness made him an object of derision to his
                    contemporaries, but who was by no means devoid of statesmanlike faculties. His
                    reign left an abiding mark on the history of the empire, for he carried forward
                    its development on the lines intended by Augustus. Client-states were absorbed,
                    southern Britain was conquered, the Romanization of the West received a powerful
                    impulse, public works were executed in Rome and Italy, and the organization of
                    the imperial bureaucracy made rapid strides. Nero <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >(a.d.</hi> 54-68), the last of the Julio-Claudian line, has been handed
                    down to posterity as the incarnation of monstrous vice and fantastic luxury. But
                    his wild excesses scarcely affected the prosperity of the empire at large; the
                    provinces were well governed, and the war with Parthia led to a compromise in
                    the matter of Armenia which secured peace for half a century. <note

               <p>The fall of Nero and the extinction of the “ progeny of the Caesars ” was
                    followed by a war of succession which revealed the military basis of the
                    Principate and the weakness of the tie connecting the emperor with Rome. Galba,
                    Otho, Vitellius and Vespasian represented in turn the legions of Spain, the
                    household troops, the army of the Rhine, and a coalition of the armies of the
                    Danube and the Euphrates; and all except Otho were already <hi rend="italic">de
                        facto</hi> emperors when they entered Rome. The final survivor in the
                    struggle, Vespasian <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 69-79), was a man of
                    comparatively humble origin, and as the Principate ceased to possess the
                    prestige of high descent it became imperatively</p>               <p>necessary to remove, as far as possible, the anomalies of the office and to give
                    it a legitimate and permanent form. Thus we find an elaborate and formal system
                    of titles substituted for the personal names of the Julio-Claudian emperors, an
                    increasing tendency to insist on the inherent prerogatives of the Principate
                    (such as the censorial power), and an attempt to invest Caesarism with an
                    hereditary character, either by natural descent or by adoption, while the
                    worship of the <hi rend="italic">Divi,</hi> or deified Caesars, was made the
                    symbol of its continuity and legitimacy. The dynasty of Vespasian and his sons
                    (Titus, A.
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">d.</hi> 79-81, Domi tian, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    81-96) became extinct on the murder of the last named, whose highhanded
                    treatment of the senate earned him the name of a tyrant; his successor,
                    Nerva,(A.D. 96-98), opened the series of “ adoptive ” emperors (Trajan, <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 98-117, Hadrian, 117-38, Antoninus Pius, 138-61,
                    Marcus Aurelius, 161-80) under whose rule the empire enjoyed a period of
                    internal tranquillity and good government. Its boundaries were extended by the
                    subjugation of northern Britain (by Agricola, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    78-84; see <hi rend="smallcaps">Britain, §</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">Roman),</hi> by the annexation of the districts included in
                    the angle of the Rhine and Danube under the Flavian emperors, and by the
                    conquest of Dacia (the modern Transylvania) under Trajan (completed in <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 106). Trajan also annexed Arabia Petraea and in
                    his closing years invaded Parthia and formed provinces of Armenia, Mesopotamia
                    and Assyria; but these conquests were surrendered by his successor, Hadrian, who
                    set himself to the task of consolidating the empire and perfecting its defences.
                    To him is due the system of permanent <hi rend="italic">limites</hi> or frontier
                    fortifications, such as the wall which protected northern Britain and the
                    palisade which replaced the chain of forts established by the Flavian emperors
                    from the Rhine to the Danube. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    had been reached, and under M. Aurelius the tide began to turn. A great part of
                    his reign was occupied with wars against the Marcomanni, Quadi, Sarmatians,
                    &amp;c., whose irruptions seriously threatened the security of Italy.
                    Henceforth Rome never ceased to be on the defensive.</p>               <p>Within the frontiers the levelling and unifying process commenced by Augustus
                    had steadily proceeded. A tolerably uniform provincial system covered the whole
                    area of the empire. The client states had one by one been reconstituted as
                    provinces, and even the government of Italy had been in many respects
                    assimilated to the provincial type. The municipal system had spread widely; the
                    period from Vespasian to Aurelius witnessed the elevation to municipal rank of
                    an immense number of communities, not only in the old provinces of the West, in
                    Africa, Spain and Gaul, but in the newer provinces of the North, and along the
                    line of the northern frontier; and everywhere under the influence of the central
                    imperial authority there was an increasing uniformity</p>               <p>in the form of the local constitutions, framed and granted as they all were by

                    and accompanied by the complete Romanizing of the people in language and

                    which have made the age of the Antonines famous, we can detect signs of
                    weakness. It was in this period that the centralization of authority in the

                    established by Augustus, which had been unreal enough in the 1st century, was
                    now, though not formally abolished, systematically ignored in practice. The
                    senate ceased to be an instrument of government, and became an imperial peerage,
                    largely composed of men not qualified by election to the quaestorship but
                    directly ennobled by the emperor. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Hadrian, who took the secretaryships out of the hands of freedmen and entrusted
                    them to procurators of equestrian rank. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    inevitable, and in some degree beneficial, as they were, brought with them the

                    whole, and a corresponding increase of pressure on the imperial government
                    itself. The reforms of Augustus had given free play to powers still fresh and

                    husbanding of such strength as still remained, or to attempts at reviving it by
                    the sheer force of imperial authority. Among the symptoms of incipient decline
                    were the growing depopulation, especially of the central districts of the
                    empire, the constant financial difficulties, the deterioration in character of
                    the local governments in the provincial communities, <note anchored="true"

                    the imperial government, which is admittedly seen in its best and most perfect
                    form in the Antonine period. In our review of the conditions which brought about
                    the fall of the Roman Republic, we saw that the collapse of the city-state made
                    Caesarism inevitable, since the extension of federal and representative
                    institutions to a world-empire lay beyond the horizon of ancient thought. The
                    benefits which Caesarism conferred upon mankind are plain. In the first place,
                    the Roman world, which had hitherto not been governed in the true sense of the
                    word, but exploited in the interests of a dominant clique, now received an
                    orderly and efficient government, under which the frightful ravages of misrule
                    and civil strife were repaired. The financial resources of the empire were

               <p>neglected. Augustus caused an official survey of the empire to be made, and a
                    scientific census of its resources was gradually carried out and from time to
                    time revised; thus the balance of revenue and expenditure could be accurately
                    estimated and adjusted, and financial stability was established. The system of
                    tax-farming was gradually abolished and direct collection substituted; commerce
                    was freed from vexatious restrictions, and large customs-districts were formed,
                    on whose borders duties were levied for revenue only. The government took even
                    more direct measures for the encouragement of industry and especially of
                    agriculture. The most remarkable of these were the “ alimentary ” institutions,
                    originally due to Nerva and developed by succeeding emperors. Capital was
                    advanced at moderate rates of interest to Italian landowners on the security of
                    their estates, and the profits of this system of land-banks were devoted to the
                    maintenance and education of poor children. The foundation of colonies for
                    time-expired soldiers, who received grants of land on their discharge,
                    contributed something to the formation of a well-to-do agricultural class; and
                    although the system was not successful in lower Italy, where economic decline
                    could not be arrested, there can be no doubt that central and northern Italy,
                    where the vine and olive were largely cultivated, and manufacturing industries
                    sprang up, enjoyed a considerable measure of prosperity. The extension of the
                    Roman municipal system to the provinces, and the watchful care exercised by the
                    imperial government over the communities, together with the profuse liberality
                    of the emperors, which was imitated by the wealthier citizens of the towns, led
                    to the creation of a flourishing municipal life still evidenced by the remains
                    which in districts such as Asia Minor or Tunis stand in significant contrast
                    with the desolation brought about by centuries of barbaric rule. Mommsen <note

                    the opinion that “ if an angel of the Lord were to strike the balance whether

                    intelligence and the greater humanity at that time or in the present day,
                    whether civilization and national prosperity generally had since that time
                    advanced or retrograded, it is very doubtful whether the decision would prove in
                    favour of the present/’</p>               <p>But there is another side to the picture. The empire brought into being a new
                    society and a new nationality, due to the fusion of Roman ideas with Hellenic
                    culture, beside which other elements, saving only, as we shall see, those
                    contributed by the Oriental religions, were insignificant. This new nationality
                    grew in definition through the gradual disappearance of distinctions of language
                    and manners, the assimilating influence of commercial and social intercourse,
                    and the extinction of national jealousies and aspirations. But the cosmopolitan
                    society thus formed was compacted of so many disparate elements that a common
                    patriotism was hard to foster, and doubly hard when the autocratic system of
                    government prevented men from aspiring to that true political distinction which
                    is attainable only in a self-governing community. It is true that there was much
                    good work to be done, and that much good work was done, in the service of the
                    emperors; true, also, that the <hi rend="italic">carrière ouverte aux
                        talents</hi> was in large measure realized. Distinctions of race were slowly
                    but steadily effaced by the grant of citizen rights to provincials and by the
                    manumission of slaves; and the career open to the Romanized provincial or the
                    liberated slave might culminate in the highest distinctions which the emperor
                    could bestow. In the hierarchy of social orders—senate, <hi rend="italic"
                        >equites</hi> and <hi rend="italic">plebs—</hi> ascent was easy and regular
                    from the lower grade to the higher; and the more enlightened of the
                    emperors—especially Hadrian-made a genuine endeavour to give a due share in the
                    work of government to the various subject races. But nothing could compensate
                    for the lack of self-determination, and although during the first century and a
                    half of imperial rule a flourishing local patriotism in some degree filled the
                    place of the wider sentiment, this gradually sank into decay and became a
                    pretext under cover of which the lower classes in the several communities</p>               <p>took toll of their wealthier fellow-citizens in the shape of public works,
                    largesses, amusements, &amp;c., until the resources at the disposal of the
                    rich ran dry, the communities themselves in many cases became insolvent, and the
                    inexorable claims of the central government were satisfied only by the surrender
                    of financial control to an imperial commissioner. Then the organs of civic life
                    became atrophied, political interest died out, and the whole burden of
                    administration, as well as that of defence, fell upon the shoulders of the
                    bureaucracy, which proved unequal to the task.</p>               <p>In a world thus governed the individual was thrown more and more upon his own

                    and pleasure, or the satisfaction of intellectual interests. Under the rule of
                    the Caesars much was done for education. Julius Caesar bestowed Roman
                    citizenship on “ teachers of the liberal arts ”; Vespasian endowed
                    professorships of Greek and Latin oratory at Rome; <note anchored="true"

                    benefits to the provinces. Local enterprise and munificence were also devoted to
                    the cause of education; we learn from the correspondence of the younger Pliny
                    that public schools were founded in the towns of northern Italy. But though
                    there was a wide diffusion of knowledge under the empire, there was no true
                    intellectual progress. Augustus, it is true, gathered about him the most
                    brilliant writers of his time, and the debut of the new monarchy coincided with
                    the Golden Age of Roman literature; but this was of brief duration, and the
                    beginning of the Christian era saw the triumph of classicism and the first steps
                    in the decline which awaits all literary movements which look to the pasj rather
                    than the future. Political oratory could not exist under an absolute ruler;
                    public life furnished no inspiring theme to poet or historian; and literature
                    became didactic or imitative, while rhetoric degenerated into declamation. It is
                    true that for some time both literature and philosophy maintained an alliance
                    with the old republican aristocracy and voiced the undercurrent of opposition to
                    the empire; but both had ceased to be irreconcilable before the time of Hadrian.
                    Under his rule classicism gave way to the archaism of which Fronto and Apuleius
                    furnish the most notable examples, and which preferred Cato and Ennius to Cicero
                    and Virgil. But this return to the past was not followed by any renewed creative
                    energy. It was a confession of weakness and little more; and the widely diffused
                    culture of the Antonine period, though outwardly brilliant, had no progressive
                    energy and presented but a feeble resistance to the dissolving forces of
                    barbarism.</p>               <p>To strike the balance of loss and gain in the field, of morals is an exceedingly
                    difficult task. The denunciations of the satirists, especially of Juvenal, might
                    lead us to believe that an appalling state of depravity existed in the society
                    of the early empire; but satirists notoriously paint in glaring colours for
                    literary effect, and whatever may be said of the morality of Rome—which was
                    probably no better and no worse than that of any cosmopolitan capital—there were
                    sound and healthy elements in plenty amongst the population of Italy and the
                    provinces. Doubtless the craving for amusement— especially for the shows of the
                    amphitheatre and the chariot-races of the circus—infected the idle masses of the
                    populace in Rome and the larger towns, and was fostered by the policy of
                    despotism, which always aims at securing cheap popularity with the proletariat;
                    but the tendency of the time, not only in the higher ranks, but also amongst
                    humbler folk, was towards a broader humanity and a more serious view of life and
                    its problems. Greek philosophy, especially the Stoic system, in order to appeal
                    to the practical Roman intelligence, found itself obliged to elaborate a rule of
                    conduct, and in many</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0654" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0701.jp2"/>
               <p>households the philosopher, generally a Greek, played the part of a director of
                    consciences. The influence of these doctrines is shown in the humane provisions
                    of the civil law as elaborated in the Antonine period, which did much to
                    mitigate the lot of the slave and to smooth the process by which freedom might
                    be attained. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="665"> The
                        massacre of the slaves of Pedanius Secundus, who had been murdered by some

                        true,.decreed by the senate; but it was a highly unpopular act, and is
                        chiefly significant as showing that the senatorial aristocracy was out of
                        harmony with the spirit of the time. </note> Above all, a religious movement
                    which drew its motive power not from Greek philosophy, but from Oriental
                    mysticism, carried the human race far from its old moorings, and culminated in
                    the triumph of Christianity. All the Eastern cults—whether of Cybele, of Isis,
                    of the Syrian Baalim or of the Persian Mithras—had this in common, that they
                    promised to their adherents redemption from the curse of the flesh and a
                    glorious immortality after death; and this fact gave them an irresistible
                    attraction for the disillusioned and overburdened subjects of the emperors. The
                    religion of Mithras, whose doctrines were specially suited to the military
                    temperament, made its way wherever the armies of the empire were stationed, and
                    seemed likely at one moment to become universal; but it was forced to yield to
                    Christianity, which refused to tolerate any rival, faced the empire with a claim
                    to absolute dominion in the spiritual sphere, and at length made that claim good

                    of most of the share in the government which it still retained; he assumed the
                    title of proconsul in Rome itself, made the prefect of the guard the vicegerent
                    of his authority, and heaped privileges upon the army, which, although they
                    secured its entire devotion to his family, impaired its efficiency as a fighting
                    force and thus weakened Rome in face of the barbarian invader. <note

                    attempt of the virtuous but weak Alexander (222-35) to restore the independence
                    of the senate. This led to a military reaction, and the elevation of the brutal
                    Maximinus, a Thracian peasant, to the throne. The disintegration of the empire
                    was the natural result; for the various provincial armies put forward their
                    commanders as claimants to the purple. A hundred ties bound them closely to the
                    districts in which they were stationed; their permanent camps had grown into
                    towns, they had families and farms; the unarmed provincials looked to them as
                    their : natural protectors, and were attached to them by bonds of intermarriage
                    and by long intercourse. Now that they found themselves left to repel by their
                    own efforts the invaders from without, they reasonably enough claimed the right

                    for themselves <hi rend="italic">imperatores</hi> whom they knew and trusted.
                    These “ tyrants, ” as they were called when unsuccessful, sprang up in
                    ever-increasing numbers, and weakened Rome’s power of resistance to the new
                    enemies who were threatening her frontiers—the Alamanni and Franks, who broke

                    (260-68), the evil reached its height. The central authority was paralysed; the
                    Romanized districts beyond the Rhine were irrevocably lost; the Persians were
                    threatening to overrun the Eastern provinces; the Goths had formed a fleet of

                    Sparta and Argos were sacked; and the legions on the frontiers were left to
                    repel the enemies of Rome as best they could. A provincial empire was
                    established by M. Cassianius Latimus Postumus in Gaul and maintained by his
                    successors, M. Piavonius Victorinus and C. Pius Esuvius Tetricus. <note

                    the barbarians and by the restoration of peace and security to the provinces of
                    Gaul. On the Danube, in Greece and in Asia Minor none of the “ pretenders ”
                    enjoyed more than a passing success. In the Far East, the Syrian Odaenathus,

                    Odaenathus was murdered in 266. His young son Vaballathus (Wahab-allath)
                    succeeded him in his titles, but* the real power was vested in his widow
                    Zenobia, under whom not only the greater part of Asia Minor but even the
                    province of Egypt was forcibly added to the dominions governed by the Palmyrene
                    prince, who ceased to acknowledge the supremacy of Rome.</p>               <p>Gallienus was murdered at Milan in 268, and after the brief reign of Claudius

                    Goths, Aurelian (270-75) restored unity to the distracted empire. Palmyra was
                    destroyed and Zenobia led a prisoner to Rome (in 273) and in the next year the
                    Gallic empire came to an end by the surrender of Tetricus. Aurelian, it is true,
                    abandoned the province of Dacia, but the defences of the Danube were
                    strengthened, and in 276 Probus repulsed the Franks and Alamanni, who had been
                    pressing on the Rhine frontier for some forty years. Finally, Carus (282)
                    recovered Armenia and Mesopotamia from the Persians and restored the frontier
                    fixed by Septimius Severus.</p>               <p>Although any serious loss of territory had been avoided, the storms of the 3rd
                    century had told with fatal effect upon the general condition of the empire. The
                    “ Roman peace ” had vanished; not only the frontier territories, but the central
                    districts of Greece, Asia Minor, and even Italy itself, had suffered from the
                    ravages of war, and the fortification of Rome by Aurelian was a significant
                    testimony to the altered condition of affairs. War, plague and famine had
                    thinned the population and crippled the resources of the provinces. On all
                    sides, land was running waste, cities and towns were decaying, and commerce was
                    paralysed. Only with the greatest difficulty were sufficient funds squeezed from
                    the exhausted taxpayers to meet the increasing cost of the defence of the
                    frontiers. The old established culture and civilization of the Mediterranean
                    world rapidly declined, and the mixture of barbaric rudeness with Oriental pomp
                    and luxury which marked the court, even of the better emperors, such as
                    Aurelian, was typical of the general deterioration* which was accelerated by the
                    growing; practice of settling barbarians on lands within the empire, and of
                    admitting them freely to service in the Roman army.</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0655" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0702.jp2"/>

                    machinery throughout the empire. In the second year of his reign Diocletian
                    associated Maximian with himself as colleague, and six years later (293) the
                    hands of the two <hi rend="sup">u</hi> Augusti ” were further strengthened by
                    the proclamation of Constantins and Galerius as “Caesares.” Precedents for such
                    an arrangement were to be found in the earlier history of the Principate <note

                    divided the burdens and responsibilities of government, without sacrificing the
                    unity of the empire; for, although to each of the Augusti and Caesars a separate
                    sphere was assigned, the Caesars were subordinate to the higher authority of the
                    Augusti, and over all his three colleagues Diocletian claimed to exercise a
                    paramount control. It also reduced the risk of a disputed succession by
                    establishing in the two Caesars the natural successors to the Augusti, and it
                    satisfied the jealous pride of the rival armies by giving them <hi rend="italic"
                        >imperatives</hi> of their own. The distribution of power between Diocletian
                    and his colleagues followed those lines of division which the feuds of the
                    previous century had marked out. The armies of the Rhine, the Danube and of
                    Syria fell to the lot respectively of Constantius, Galerius and Diocletian, the
                    central districts of Italy and Africa to</p>               <p>Maximian. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="672"> The

               </p>               <p>In the new system the imperial authority was finally emancipated from all
                    constitutional limitation and control and the last traces of it's republican
                    origin disappeared. The emperors from Diocletian onwards were autocrats in
                    theory as well as in practice. This avowed despotism Diocletian, following in
                    the steps of Aurelian, hedged round with all the pomp and majesty of</p>               <p>Oriental monarchy. The final adoption of the title <hi rend="italic"

                    </note> In both there is the utmost possible subordination and division of
                    authority. The subdivision of provinces, begun by the emperors of the 2nd
                    century, was systematically carried out by Diocletian, and each official, civil
                    or military, was placed directly under the orders of a superior; thus a
                    continuous chain of authority connected the emperor with the meanest official in
                    his service. Finally, the various grades in these two imperial services were
                    carefully marked by the appropriation to each of distinctive titles, the highest
                    being that of <hi rend="italic">illustris,</hi> which was confined to the

               </p>               <p>There can be little doubt that on the whole these reforms prolonged the
                    existence of the empire, by creating a machinery which enabled the stronger
                    emperors to utilize effectively all its available resources, and which even to
                    some extent made good the deficiencies of weaker rulers.</p>               <p>But in many points they failed to attain their object. Diocletian’s division of
                    the imperial authority among colleagues, subject to the general control of the
                    senior Augustus, was effectually discredited by the twenty years of almost
                    constant conflict which followed his own abdication (305-23). Constantine’s
                    partition of the empire among his three sons was not more successful in ensuring
                    tranquillity, and in the final division of the East and West between Valens and
                    Valentinian (364) the essential principle of Diocletian’s scheme, the
                    maintenance of a single central authority, was abandoned. The “ tyrants,” the
                    curse of the 3rd century, were far from unknown in the 4th. The system,
                    moreover, while it failed altogether to remove some of the existing evils,
                    aggravated others. The already overburdened financial resources of the empire
                    were strained still further by the increased expenditure necessitated by the
                    substitution of four imperial courts for one, and by the multiplication in every
                    direction of paid officials. The gigantic bureaucracy of the 4th century proved,
                    in spite of its undoubted services, an intolerable weight upon the energies of
                    the empire.</p>               <p>Diocletian and Maximian formally abdicated their high office in 305. Nineteen
                    years later Constantine I., the Great, the sole survivor of six rival emperors,
                    united the whole empire under his own rule. His reign of fourteen years was
                    marked by two events of first-rate importance,—the recognition of Christianity
                    as the religion oi the</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0656" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0703.jp2"/>

                    imperial government, while it enlisted on the side of the state one of the most
                    powerful of the new forces with which it had to reckon, imposed a check, which
                    was in time to become a powerful one, on the imperial authority. The
                    establishment of the new “ City of Constantine/* as a second Rome paved the way
                    for the final separation of East and West by providing the former for the first
                    time with a suitable seat of government on the Bosphorus. The death of
                    Constantine in 337 was followed, as the abdication of Diocletian had been, by
                    the outbreak of quarrels among rival Caesars. Of the three sons of Constantine
                    who in</p>               <p>337 divided the empire between them, Constantine the eldest fell in civil war
                    against his brother Constans; Constans himself was, ten years afterwards,
                    defeated and slain by Magnentius; and the latter in his turn was in 353
                    vanquished by Constantine’s only surviving son Constantius.</p>               <p>Thus for the second time the whole empire was united under the rule of a member
                    of the house of Constantine. But in 355 Constantius granted the title of Caesar
                    to his cousin Julian and placed him in charge of Gaul, where the momentary
                    elevation of a tyrant, Silvanus, and still more the inroads of Franks and
                    Alamanni, had excited alarm. But Julian’s successes during the next five years
                    were such as to arouse the jealous fears of Constantius. In order to weaken his
                    suspected rival the legions under Julian in Gaul were suddenly ordered to march
                    eastward against the Persians</p>               <p>(360). They refused; and when the order was repeated, replied by proclaiming
                    Julian himself emperor and Augustus. Julian, with probably sincere reluctance,
                    accepted the position, but the death of Constantius in 361 saved the empire from
                    the threatened civil war. Julian’s attempted restoration of pagan and in
                    especial of Hellenic worships had no more permanent effect than the war which he
                    courageously waged against the multitudinous abuses which had grown up in the
                    luxurious court of Constantius. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    administration in Gaul undoubtedly checked the barbarian advance across the
                    Rhine, and postponed the loss of the Western provinces; on the contrary, his
                    campaign in Persia, brilliantly successful at first, ended in his own death</p>               <p>(363), and his successor, Jovian, immediately surrendered the territories beyond
                    the Tigris won by Diocletian seventy years before. Jovian died on the</p>               <p>17th of February 364; and on the 26th of February Valentinian was acknowledged
                    as emperor of the army at Nicaea. In obedience to the wish of the soldiers that
                    he should associate a colleague with himself, he conferred the title of Augustus
                    upon his brother Valens, and the division of the empire was at last
                    effected,—Valentinian became emperor of the West, Valens of the East.
                    Valentinian maintained the integrity of the empire until his death (in 375),
                    which deprived the weaker Valens of a trusted counsellor and ally, and was
                    followed by a serious crisis on the Danube. In 376 the Goths, hard pressed by
                    their new foes from the eastward, the Huns, sought and obtained the protection
                    of the Roman</p>               <p>Empire. They were transported across the Danube and settled in Moesia, but,
                    indignant at the treatment they received, they rose in arms against their
                    protectors. In 378 at Adrianople Valens was defeated and killed, and the
                    victorious Goths advanced eastward to the very walls of Constantinople. Once
                    more, however, the danger passed away. The skill and tact of Theodosius, who had
                    been proclaimed emperor of the East by Gratian, <note anchored="true"

                    in large numbers entered the service of the Roman emperor. The remaining</p>               <p>years of Theodosius s reign (382-95) were mainly engrossed by the duty of
                    upholding the increasingly feeble authority of his western colleague against the
                    attacks of pretenders. Maximus, the murderer of Gratian (383), was at first
                    recognized by Theodosius as Caesar, and left in undisturbed command of Gaul,
                    Spain and Britain; but, when in 386 he proceeded to oust Valentinian II. from
                    Italy and Africa, Theodosius marched westward, crushed him, and installed
                    Valentinian as emperor of the West. In the very next year, however, the murder
                    of Valentinian (392) by Arbogast, a Frank, was followed by the appearance of a
                    fresh tyrant in the person of Eugenius, a domestic officer and nominee of
                    Arbogast himself.</p>               <p>Once more Theodosius marched westward, and near Aquileia decisively defeated his
                    opponents. But his victory was quickly followed by his own illness and death
                    (395), and the fortunes of East and West passed into the care of his two sons

                    dissensions or incapacity of the emperors to cross the frontiers and harry the
                    lands of the provincials. Constantine (306-12), Julian (356-60) and Valentinian
                    I. (364-75) had each to give a temporary breathing-space to Gaul by repelling
                    the Franks and Alamanni. Britain was harassed by Piets and Scots from the north
                    (367-70), while the Saxon pirates swept the northern seas and the coasts both of
                    Britain and Gaul. On the Danube the Quadi, Sarmatae, and above all the Goths,
                    poured at intervals into the provinces of Pannonia and Moesia, and penetrated to
                    Macedon and Thrace. In the East, in addition to the constant border feud with

                    within the frontiers had been taken up on a larger scale and in a more
                    systematic way by the Illyrian emperors of the 3rd century, and was continued by
                    their successors in the 4th. In Gaul, in the provinces south of the Danube, even
                    in Macedon and Italy, large barbarian settlements had been made —Theodosius in
                    particular distinguishing himself by his liberality in this respect. Nor did the

                    imperial service. Under Constantine the palace was crowded with Franks. <note

                    Alans, as well as of Goths. The names of Arbogast, Stilicho and Rufinus are
                    sufficient proof of the place held by barbarians near the emperor’s person and
                    in the control of the provinces and legions of Rome; and the relations of
                    Arbogast to his nominee for the purple, Eugenius, were an anticipation of those
                    which existed between Ricimer and the emperors of the latter half</p>               <p>of the 5 th century.</p>               <p>It was by barbarians already settled within the empire that the first of the
                    series of attacks which finally separated the western provinces from the empire
                    and set up a barbaric ruler in Italy were made, and it was in men of barbarian
                    birth that Rome found her ablest and most successful defenders. The Visigoths
                    whom Alaric led into Italy had been settled south of the Danube as the allies of
                    the empire since the accession of Theodosius. But, like the Germans of the days
                    of Caesar, they wanted land for their own, and Alaric himself aspired to raise
                    himself to the heights which had been reached before him by the Vandal Stilicho
                    at Ravenna and the Goth Rufinus at Constantinople. The jealousy which existed
                    between the rulers of the western and eastern empires furthered his plans. In
                    the name of Arcadius, the emperor of the east, or at least with the connivance
                    of Arcadius’s minister Rufinus, he occupied the province of Illyricum, and from
                    thence ravaged Greece, which, according to the existing division of provinces,
                    belonged to the western empire. Thence in 396 he retreated before Stilicho to
                    Illyricum, with the command of which he was now formally invested by Arcadius;
                    he thus gained a base of operations against Italy. <note anchored="true"

                    families, their wagons and treasure, to seek lands for themselves south of the
                    Alps. But in this first invasion he penetrated no farther than the plains of
                    Lombardy, and after the desperate battle of Pollentia (402 or 403) he slowly
                    withdrew from Italy, his retreat being hastened by the promises of gold freely
                    made to him by the imperial government. Not until the autumn of 408 did Alaric
                    again cross the Alps. Stilicho was dead; the barbarian troops in Honorius’s
                    service had been provoked into joining Alaric by the anti-Teutonic policy of
                    Honorius and his ministers, and Alaric marched .unopposed to Rome. The payment
                    of a heavy ransom, however, saved the city. Negotiations followed between Alaric
                    and the court of Ravenna. Alaric’s demands were moderate, but Honorius would
                    grant neither lands for his people nor the honourable post in the imperial
                    service which he asked for himself. Once more Alaric sat down before Rome, and
                    the citizens were forced to agree to his terms. Attalus, a Greek, the prefect of
                    the city, was declared Augustus, and Alaric accepted the post of
                    commander-in-chief. But after a few months Alaric formally deposed Attalus, on
                    account of his incapacity, and renewed his offers to Honorius. Again they were

                    </note> and the invasion of Gaul and Italy by Attila. The Vandal settlement in
                    Africa was closely akin in its origin and results to those of the Visigoths and
                    of the Vandals themselves in Gaul and Spain. Here, as there, the occasion was
                    given by the jealous quarrels of powerful imperial ministers.</p>               <p>The feud between Boniface, count of Africa, and Aetius, the “ master-general ”
                    or “ count of Italy,” opened the way to Africa for the Vandal king Gaiseric
                    (Genseric), as that between Stilicho and Rufinus had before set Alaric in motion
                    westward, and as the quarrel between the tyrant Constantine and the ministers of
                    Honorius had paved the way for the Vandals, Suebes and Alans into Spain. In this
                    case, too, land-hunger was the impelb'ng motive with the barbarian invader, and
                    in Africa, as in Gaul and Spain, the invaders’ acquisitions were confirmed by
                    the imperial authority which they still professed to recognize. In 429 Gaiseric,
                    king of the Vandals, crossed with his warriors, their families and goods, to the
                    province of Africa, hitherto almost untouched by the ravages of war. Thanks to
                    the quarrels of Boniface and Aetius, their task was an easy one. The province
                    was quickly overrun. In 435 <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    were the granary of Rome, in exchange for a payment probably of corn and oil.
                    Carthage was taken in 439, and by 440 the Vandal kingdom was firmly established.</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0658" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0705.jp2"/>

                    branches of literature, was a late growth amongst the Romans, and it is very
                    difficult to determine how far authentic records were preserved of the earlier
                    republican period. It seems that the calendars issued yearly by the pontifices
                    and posted on the walls of the Regia were inscribed with brief notices of
                    important events (" digna memoratu . .. domi militiaeque terra marique gesta per
                    singulos dies,” Serv. <hi rend="italic">Ad Aen.</hi> i. 373); these tabulae were
                    preserved and edited in 80 books by P. Mucius Scaevola <hi rend="italic"

                    name of <hi rend="italic">Annales Maximi.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Commentarii</hi> preserved in the archives of the various priestly colleges
                    and official boards <hi rend="italic">(e.g.</hi> consuls and censors), which
                    appear to have consisted mainly of instructions as to official procedure,
                    doubtless furnished historical material in the shape of precedents and
                    decisions. It is hard to say how much of this documentary evidence survived the
                    burning of Rome by the Gauls; the fact that the earliest solar eclipse mentioned
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Annales Maximi</hi> was that of the 5th of June, 351
                    B.c., casts doubt on the completeness of the earlier records.</p>               <p>Many modern scholars have supposed that these meagre official records were
                    supplemented by—(a) popular poetry, more or less legendary in content; (d)
                    family chronicles, the substance of which was worked up into the funeral
                    orations <hi rend="italic">(Iaudationes funebres)</hi> pronounced at the grave
                    of distinguished Romans. The existence of the. former class of documents is,
                    however, quite unsupported by evidence; as to family tradition, we cannot say
                    more than that it has probably left a deposit in the accounts of republican
                    history handed down to us, ana caused the exploits of the members of illustrious
                    houses to be exaggerated in importance.</p>               <p>Setting aside the works of Greek historians who incidentally touched on Roman
                    affairs, such as Hieronymus of Cardia, who wrote of the wars of Pyrrhus as a
                    contemporary, and Timaeus of Tauromenium (c. 345-250 B.C.), who treated of the
                    history of Sicily and the West down to 272 B.C., the earliest writers on Roman

                    variety of ways different from those of the Visigoths and Vandals. Nearly a
                    century had passed since the Huns first appeared in Europe, and drove the Goths
                    to seek shelter within the Roman lines. Attila was now the ruler of a great
                    empire in central and northern Europe and, in addition to his own Huns, the
                    German tribes along the Rhine and Danube and far away to the north owned him as
                    king. He confronted the Roman power as an equal; and, unlike the Gothic and
                    Vandal chieftains, he treated with the emperors of east and west as an
                    independent sovereign. His advance on Gaul and Italy threatened, not the
                    establishment of one more barbaric chieftain on Roman soil, but the sub-jugation
                    of the civilized and Christian West to the rule of a heathen and semi-barbarous
                    conqueror. But the Visigoths in Gaul, Christian and already half Romanized,
                    rallied to the aid of the empire against a common foe. Attila, defeated at

                    Italy and sacked Rome. From 456-72 the actual ruler of Italy was Ricimer, the
                    Suebe. Of the four emperors whom he placed on the throne, Majorian (457-61)

               </p>               <p>The installation of a barbarian king in Italy was the natural climax of the
                    changes which had been taking place in the West throughout the 5th century. In
                    Spain, Gaul and Africa barbarian chieftains were already established as kings.
                    In Italy, for the last twenty years, the real power had been wielded by a
                    barbarian officer. Odoacer, when he decided to dispense with the nominal
                    authority of an emperor of the West, placed Italy on the same level of
                    independence with the neighbouring provinces. But the old ties with Rome were
                    not severed. The new king of Italy formally recognized the supremacy of the one

                    summarily, but. wrote more fully of their own times. They were followed in their
                    use of the Greek language by C. Acilius (introduced a Greek embassy to the

                    at Rome and a vigorous opponent of Greek influence, had treated of Roman

                    Latin language as the medium of historical writing was followed by the annalists

                    canons of criticism to the traditional accounts of early Roman history, but they
                    did little more than rationalize the more obviously mythical narratives; they
                    also followed Greek literary models and introduced speeches, &amp;c., for
                    artistic effect. Where they wrote as contemporaries, however, <hi rend="italic"
                        >e.g.</hi> Fannius in his account of the Gracchan movement, their works were
                    of the highest value. About the beginning of this period Polybius (ç.v.) had
                    published his history, which originally embraced the period of the Punic wars,
                    and was afterwards continued to 146 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> His influence
                    was not fully exerted upon Roman historians until the close of the 2nd and early
                    part of the 1st century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when a school of writers
                    arose who treated history .with a practical purpose, endeavouring to trace the
                    motives of action and to point a moral for the edification of their readers. To
                    this school belonged Sempronius Asellio, Claudius Quadrigarius,. Valerius Antias
                    and C. Licinius Macer (d. 66 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> Their writings
                    were diffuse, rhetorical and inaccurate; Livy complains of the gross
                    exaggerations of Valerius (whom he followed blindly in his earlier books), and
                    Macer seems to have drawn much of his material from sources of very doubtful
                    authenticity. Contemporary history was written by Cornelius Sisenna (119-67 B.c.), and the work of Polybius was continued to 86 B.c. by
                    the Stoic Posidonius (c. 135-45 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> a man of
                    encyclopaedic knowledge. From the Gracchan period onwards the memoirs, speeches
                    and correspondence of distinguished statesmen were often published; of these no
                    specimens are extant until we come to the Ciceronian period, when the Speeches
                    and Letters of Cicero <hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> and the Commentaries of
                    Julius Caesar <hi rend="italic">(q.v.)—</hi> the latter continued to the close
                    of the Civil War by other hands—furnish invaluable evidence for the history of
                    their times. We possess examples of historical pamphlets with a strong party
                    colouring in Sallust’s tracts on the Jugurthine War and the conspiracy of
                    Catiline. During the same period Roman antiquities, genealogy, chronology,
                    &amp;c., were exhaustively treated by M. Terentius Varro (116-27 B.c.)
                    <hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> in his <hi rend="italic">Antiquitates</hi> (in 41
                    books) and other works. . Cicero’s friend, M. Pomponius Atticus, also compiled a
                    chronological table which was widely used, and Cornelius Nepos <hi rend="italic"
                        >(q.v.)</hi> wrote a series of historical biographies which have come down
                    to us.</p>               <p>In the Augustan age the materials accumulated by previous generations were
                    worked up by compilers whose works are. in some cases preserved. The work of
                    Livy <hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> covered the history of Rome from its
                    foundation to 9 B.C. in 142 books; of these only 35 are
                    preserved in their entirety, while the contents of the rest are known in outline
                    from an epitome <hi rend="italic">(periochae)</hi> and from the compendia of
                    Florus and later authors. Diodorus Siculus <hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> of
                    Agyrium in Sicily followed the earlier annalists in the sections of his <hi
                        rend="italic">Universal History</hi> (down to Caesar) which dealt with Roman
                    affairs; Dionysius of Halicarnassus <hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Roman Archaeology</hi> (published in 7 B.C.), treated early Roman history in a more ambitious and rhetorical
                    style, with greater fulness than Livy, whose work he seems to have used.
                    Universal histories were also written in the Augustan age by Nicolaus of
                    Damascus, a <hi rend="italic">protégé</hi> of Herod the Great, and Trogus
                    Pompeius, whose work is known to us from the epitome of Justin (2nd century A.D.). Juba, the learned king of Mauretania installed by
                    Augustus, wrote a History of Rome as well as antiquarian works. Strabo <hi
                        rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> whose <hi rend="italic">Geography</hi> is extant,
                    was the author of a continuation of Polybius’s history (to 27 <hi

                    encyclopaedia of* Verrius Flaccus, of which we possess part of Festus’s
                    abridgment (2nd century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> together with an

                    An official list of the consuls and other chief magistrates of the republic was
                    inscribed on the walls of the Regia (rebuilt 36 B.c.),

                        >principi di scienza nuova</hi> were published in 1725. The credibility of
                    the traditional account of Roman republican history was called in question by
                    Louis de Beaufort <hi rend="italic">(Dissertation sur l'incertitude des cinq
                        premiers siècles de l'histoire romaine,</hi> 1738); but the modem critical
                    movement dates from Niebuhr, two volumes of whose <hi rend="italic">Römische
                        Geschichte</hi> appeared in 1811-12 (the third was published after his death
                    in 1832, his lectures in 1840). The early history of Rome was fully treated by
                    Niebuhr’s follower, F. C. A. Schwegler, whose <hi rend="italic">Römische
                        Geschichte</hi> in 3 vols. (1853-58) was continued to 327 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> by O. Clason (vols. 4 and 5,1873-76). A reaction
                    against the negative criticism of Niebuhr was headed by J. Rubino, who showed in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Untersuchungen über römische Verfassung und
                        Geschichte</hi> O839) that the growth of the Roman constitution might be
                    traced with some approach to certainty by the analysis of institutions. It was
                    left for Theodor Mommsen <hi rend="italic">(Römische Geschichte,</hi> ist ed.,
                    1854-56; Eng. trans, new ed. in 5 vols., 1894; <hi rend="italic">Römische

                    reduce Roman constitutional history to a science. Mommsen substituted for the
                    detailed criticism of the traditional narrative a picture of the growth of
                    Italian civilization based on linguistic, literary and monumental evidence. W.
                    Ihne <hi rend="italic">(Römische Geschichte,</hi> 8 vols., 1868-90) dealt more
                    fully with the course of events as related by ancient historians. L. Lange’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Römische Alterthümer</hi> (1856-71), 3 vols., treated
                    constitutional history in a narrative form. In more recent times Eduard Meyer
                    has treated of early Italian history in his <hi rend="italic">Geschichte des
                        Alterthums,</hi> vols, ii.-v. (1893-1902); and Ettore Pais, in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Storia di Roma,</hi> vols, i.-ii. (1898-99), has subjected the
                    narratives of Roman history down to the Samnite wars to a searching and in many
                    cases exaggerated criticism. De Sanctis, in his <hi rend="italic">Storia del
                        Romani</hi> (2 vois., 1907) (down to the establishment of the Roman hegemony
                    in Italy), combines radical criticism of tradition with a constructive useof
                    archaeological and other evidence. Heitland’s <hi rend="italic">Roman
                        Republic</hi> (3 vols., 1909) is a fresh and independent work. The last
                    century of the republic has been the subject of many works (see reff, in text

                    in the closing books of his work, which have not been preserved. Dio Cassius, a
                    Bithynian who attained to the dignity of a second consulship as the colleague of
                    Severus Alexander, wrote a history of Rome to the death of Elagabalus in 80
                    books. We possess only epitomes and excerpts of the portion dealing with events
                    from <hi rend="smallcaps">A.d.</hi> 46 onwards, except for parts of the 78th and
                    79th books, in which Dio’s narrative of contemporary events is especially
                    valuable. Herodian, a Syrian employed in the imperial service, wrote a history
                    of the emperors from Commodus to Gordian HI., which as the work of a
                    contemporary is not without value, although the author had no historical
                    insight. L. Marius Maximus compiled biographies of the emperors from Nerva to
                    Elagabalus which, like those of Suetonius, contained much worthless gossip. His
                    work was amongst the sources used in the compilation 01 the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Historia Augusta</hi> (see further <hi rend="smallcaps">Augustan
                        History),</hi> upon which we are obliged to rely for the history of the 3rd
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> This work consists in a series of lives
                    of the emperors (including most of the pretenders to that title) from Hadrian to
                    Carinus, professedly written by six authors, Spartianus, Vulcacius Gallicanus,
                    Capitolinus, Lampridius,Trebellius Pollio, and Vopiscus, under Diocletian and
                    Constantine. Modern criticism has shown that (at least in its present form) it
                    is a compilation made towards the close of the ^th century; it is not even
                    certain that any of the above-named writers really existed, and the documents
                    inserted in the text are palpable forgeries. The earlier biographies, however,
                    contain much authentic information, which seems to have been derived from a good
                    contemporary source. The fragments of Dexippus, an Athenian who successfully
                    defended his native town against the Goths, throw much light on the barbaric
                    invasions of the 3rd century. Under Diocletian and his successors <hi

                    slight historical value. The history of the final struggle between church and

                    published under the name of. the Anonymus Valesianus furnishes a brief
                    contemporary narrative of the period 305-37, without Christian prepossessions;
                    while the lost work of Praxagoras treated the history of Constantine from the
                    pagan standpoint. The most important historian of the 4th century was Ammianus
                    Marcellinus, a native of Antioch and an officer in the imperial guard, who
                    continued the work of Tacitus (in Latin) to the death of Valens. We possess the
                    last eighteen books of his history which cover the years <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    (not by the same author,) which goes down to Theodosius I. Similar works are the

                    continued the history of Dexippus to <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 404—are of

                    given by the three orthodox historians Socrates, Sozomen and Theodoret, and the
                    Arian Philostorgius, all of whom wrote in the 5th century. An imperial official,
                    Zosimus, writing in the latter half of that century, gave a sketch of imperial
                    history to <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 410; the latter part is zaluable,
                    being based on contemporary writings, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> those of the
                    Egyptian Olympiodorus, of whose work some fragments arc preserved. The bishops
                    Synesius and Palladius, who lived under Arcadius and Theodosius IL, furnish
                    valuable information as to their own times; while the fragments of Priscus tell
                    us much of Attila and the Hunnish invasions. Mention must also be made of the
                    poets and letter-writers of the 4th and 5th centuries—Ausonius, Claudian,
                    Symmachus, Paulinus of Nola, Sidonius Apollinaris, Prudentius, Merobaudes and
                    others—from whose writings much historical information is derived. Cassiodorus,
                    the minister of Theodoric, wrote a history of the Goths, transmitted to us in

                    the light of recent discoveries. Mommsen’s fifth volume (Eng. tr., as <hi
                        rend="italic">Provinces of the Roman Empire,</hi> 1886) is not a narrative,
                    but an account of Roman culture in the various provinces. C. Merivale’s <hi

                    handbook. For the later period we have Bury’s <hi rend="italic">History of the

               </p>               <p>The history of the Roman commune as distinguished from the papacy during the
                    middle ages has yet to be written, and only by the discovery of new documents
                    can the difficulties of the task be completely overcome. Although very different
                    in its origin, the Roman Republic gradually assumed the same form as the other
                    Italian communes, and with almost identical institutions. But, owing to the
                    special local conditions amid which it arose, it maintained a distinct
                    physiognomy and character. The deserted Campagna surrounding the city checked
                    any notable increase of trade or industry, and prevented the establishment of
                    the gilds on the solid footing that elsewhere made them the basis and support of
                    the commune. There was also the continual and oppressive influence of the
                    empire, and, above all, the presence of the papacy, which often appeared to
                    absorb the political vitality of the city. At such moments the commune seemed
                    annihilated, but it speedily revived and reasserted itself. Consequently there
                    are many apparent gaps in its history, and we have often extreme difficulty in
                    discovering the invisible links connecting the visible fragments.</p>               <p>Even the aristocracy of Rome had a special stamp. In the other republics, with
                    the exception of Venice, it was feudal, of German origin, and in perpetual
                    conflict with the popular and commercial elements which sought its destruction.
                    The history of municipal freedom in Italy lay in this struggle. But the
                    infiltration of Teutonic and feudal elements broke up the</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0661" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0708.jp2"/>
               <p>ancient aristocracy of Rome, gave it a special character and left it at the
                    mercy of the people. Then the popes, by the bestowal of lucrative offices, rich
                    benefices and vast estates, and, above all, by raising many nobles to the
                    purple, introduced new blood into the Roman aristocracy, and endued it with
                    increasing strength and vitality. Always divided, always turbulent, this
                    irrepressible body was a continual source of discord and civil war, of permanent
                    confusion and turmoil. Amidst all these difficulties the commune struggled on,
                    but never succeeded in preserving a regular course or administration for long.
                    What with continual warfare, attacks on the Capitol and consequent slaughter,
                    pillage and incendiarism, it is no wonder that so few original documents are
                    left to illustrate the history of the Roman Republic. Nor have chroniclers and
                    historians done much to supply this want, since, in treating of Roman affairs,
                    their attention is mainly devoted to the pope and the emperor. Nevertheless, we
                    will attempt to connect in due order all the facts gleaned from former writers
                    and published records.</p>               <p>The removal of the seat of the empire to Constantinople effected a radical
                    change in the political situation of Rome; nor was this change neutralized by
                    the formation of the weak Western empire soon to be shattered by the Germanic
                    invasions. But we still find Roman laws and institutions; and no sign is yet
                    manifest of the rise of a medieval municipality. The earliest germ of this new
                    type of municipality is seen during the barbarian invasions. Of these we need
                    only enumerate the four most important—those of the Goths, Byzantines (who,
                    however, were not mere barbarians but civilized and corrupt), Lombards and
                    Franks. The Gothic rule merely superimposed upon the Roman social order a
                    Teutonic stratum, that never penetrated beneath its surface. The Goths always
                    remained a conquering army; according to the German custom, they took possession
                    of one-third of the vanquished territory, but, while forbidding the Romans to
                    bear arms, left their local administration intact. The senate, the curiae, the
                    principal magistrates, both provincial and municipal, the prefect of the city,
                    and the Roman judges enforcing the enactments of the Roman law, were all
                    preserved. Already, under the empire, the civil power had been separated from
                    the military, and this separation was maintained. Hence there was no visible
                    change in the constitution of the state. Only, now there were conquered and
                    conquerors. All real and effective power was on the side of brute force, and the
                    Goths alone bore arms. In every province they had their <hi rend="italic"
                        >comites,</hi> or heads of the army, who had judicial power over their
                    countrymen, especially in criminal cases. Here, then, was a combination of civil
                    and military jurisdiction altogether contrary to Roman ideas. Nor can it be
                    denied that the <hi rend="italic">comiles,</hi> as chiefs of the armed force,
                    necessarily exerted a direct or indirect influence on the civil and
                    administrative power of the provinces, and especially upon the collection of the
                    imposts. The civil arm, being virtually subordinate to the military, suffered
                    unavoidable change. Notwithstanding the praise lavished on Theodoric, the
                    kingdom founded by him in Italy had no solid basis. It was composed of two
                    nations differing in race and traditions and even in religion, since the Goths
                    were Arians and the Romans Catholics. The latter were sunk in degeneracy and
                    corruption; their institutions were old and decrepit. It was necessary to infuse
                    new life into the worn-out body. This was difficult, perhaps impossible; and at
                    any rate Theodoric never attempted the task. Little wonder then if the Gothic
                    kingdom succumbed to the Byzantine armies from Constanti</p>               <p>nople.</p>               <p>The wars of Bclisarius and Narses against the Goths lasted twenty years (535-55
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> caused terrible slaughter and devastation
                    in Italy, and finally subjected her to Constantinople. In place of a Gothic king
                    she was now ruled by a Greek patrician, afterwards entitled the exarch, who had
                    his seat of government at Ravenna as lieutenant of the empire. In the chief
                    provincial cities the ruling counts were replaced by dukes, subordinate to the
                    exarch; and the smaller towns were governed by military tribunes. Instead of
                    dukes, we sometimes find <hi rend="italic">magistri militum,</hi> apparently of
                    higher rank. The <hi rend="italic">praefcctus praetorio</hi> of Italy, likewise
                    a dependent of the exarch, was at the head of the civil administration. The
                    pragmatic sanction (554), promulgating the Justinian code, again separated the
                    civil from the military power, which was no longer allowed to intervene in the
                    settlement of private disputes, and, by conferring on the bishops the
                    superintendence of and authority over the provincial and municipal government,
                    soon led to the increase of the power of the church, which had already
                    considerable influence.</p>               <p>The new organization outwardly resembled that of the Goths: one army had been
                    replaced by another, the counts by dukes; there was an exarch instead of a king;
                    the civil and military jurisdictions were more exactly defined. But the army was
                    not, like that of the Goths, a conquering nation in arms; it was a Graeco-Roman
                    army, and did not hold a third of the territory which was now probably added to
                    the possessions of the state <hi rend="italic">{fisc}.</hi> The soldiery took
                    its pay from Constantinople, whence all instructions and appointments of
                    superior officers likewise proceeded. In Rome we find a <hi rend="italic"
                        >magister militum</hi> at the head of the troops. The Roman senate still
                    existed, but was reduced to a shadow. Theodoric had left it intact until he
                    suspected it of hostile designs and dealings with the Byzantines, but then began
                    to persecute it, as was proved by the wretched fate of Boetius and Symmachus.
                    Nevertheless the senate survived, added the functions of a <hi rend="italic"
                        >curia</hi> or municipal council to those of a governmental assembly, and
                    took part -in the election of the pope—already one of the chief affairs of Rome.
                    So many senators, however, were slaughtered during the Byzantine War that it was
                    commonly believed to be extinct. The pragmatic sanction, conferring on senate
                    and pope the superintendence of weights and measures in Italy, might seem a
                    convincing proof to the contrary, although, in the general chaos, now that Rome
                    was a mere provincial city, constantly exposed to attack, we may imagine to what
                    the senate was reduced.</p>               <p>All Roman institutions were altered and decayed; but their original features
                    were still to be traced, and no heterogeneous element had been introduced into
                    them. The first dawn of a completely new epoch can only be dated from the
                    invasion of the Lombards (568-72). Their conquest of a large portion of Italy
                    was accompanied by the harshest oppression. They abolished all ancient laws and
                    institutions, and not only seized a third of the land, but reduced the
                    inhabitants almost to slavery. But, in the unsubdued parts of the
                    country—namely, in Ravenna, Rome and the maritime cities—a very different state
                    of things prevailed. The necessity for self-defence and the distance of the
                    empire, now too worn out to render any assistance, compelled the inhabitants to
                    depend solely on their own strength. Thus, certain maritime cities, such as
                    Naples, Amalfi, Pisa and Venice, soon attained to a greater or less degree of
                    liberty and independence.</p>               <p>This is the moment in which ancient society seems to disappear completely and a
                    new one begins to rise. Ancient customs disappear, Christian processions take
                    the place of the ancient games, ancient temples are transformed into churches
                    and dedicated to new saints. If Roman tradition in Italy can ever be said to
                    have been completely broken, this could only be during the Longobard domination.
                    It is certain, however, that soon the elements of ancient culture began to
                    revive once more.</p>               <p>A special state of things now arose in Rome. We behold the rapid growth of the
                    papal power and the continual increase of its moral and political influence.
                    This had already begun under Leo I., and been further promoted by the pragmatic
                    sanction. Not only the superintendence but often the nomination of public
                    functionaries and judges was now in the hands of the popes. And the accession to
                    St Peter’s chair of a man of real genius in the person of Gregory I., surnamed
                    the Great, marked the beginning of a new era. By force of individual character,
                    as well as by historic</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0662" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0709.jp2"/>
               <p>necessity, this pope became the most potent personage in Rome. Power fell
                    naturally into his hands; he was the true representative of the city, the born
                    defender of church and- state. His ecclesiastical authority, already great
                    throughout Italy, was specially great in the Roman diocese and in southern
                    Italy. The continual offerings of the faithful had previously endowed the church
                    with enormous possessions in the province of Rome, in Sicily, Sardinia and other
                    parts. The administration of all this property soon assumed the shape of a small
                    government council in Rome. In the middle ages the owner of the land was also
                    master of the men who cultivated it, and exercised political authority as well;
                    these administrators therefore protected and succoured the oppressed, settled
                    disputes, nominated judges and controlled the ecclesiastical authorities. The
                    use made by the pope of his revenues greatly contributed to the increase of his
                    moral and political authority. When the city was besieged by the Lombards, and
                    the emperor left his army unpaid, Gregory supplied the required funds and thus
                    made resistance possible. And, when the defence could be no longer maintained,
                    he alone, by the weight of his personal influence and the payment of large sums,
                    induced the Lombards to raise the siege. He negotiated in person with Agilulph,
                    and was recognized by him as the true representative of the city. Thus Rome,
                    after being five times taken and sacked by the barbarians, was, on this
                    occasion, saved by its bishop. The exarch, although unable to give any help,
                    protested against the assumption of so much authority by the pope; but Gregory
                    was no usurper; his attitude was the natural result of events. “ For
                    twenty-seven years ”•—so wrote this pontiff to the imperial government of
                    Constantinople—“ we lived in terror of the Longobards, nor can I say what sums
                    we had to pay them. There is an imperial treasurer with the army at Ravenna; but
                    here it is I who am treasurer. Likewise I have to provide for the clergy, the
                    poor and the people, and even to succour the distress of other churches.”</p>               <p>It was at this moment that the new Roman commune began to take shape and acquire
                    increasing vigour owing to its distance from the seat of the empire and its
                    resistance to the Lombard besiegers. Its special character was now to be traced
                    in the preponderance of the military over the civil power. ‘A Roman element had
                    penetrated into the army, which was already possessed of considerable political
                    importance. The prefect of Rome loses authority and seems almost a nullity
                    compared with the <hi rend="italic">magister militum.</hi> Hardly anything is
                    heard of the senate. “ Quia enim Senatus deest, populus interiit,” exclaims
                    Gregory in a moment of despair. The popes now make common cause with the people
                    against the Lombards on the one hand and the emperor on the other. But they
                    avoid an absolute rupture with the empire, lest they should have to face the
                    Lombard power without any prospect of help. Later, when the growing strength of
                    the commune becomes menacing, they remain faithful to the empire in order not to
                    be at the mercy of the people. It was a permanent feature of their policy never
                    to allow the complete independence of the city until they should be its sole and
                    absolute masters. But that time was still in the future. Meanwhile pope and
                    people joined in the defence</p>               <p>of their common interests.</p>               <p>This alliance was cemented by the religious disputes of the East and the West.
                    First came the Monothelite controversy regarding the twofold nature of Christ.
                    Later a long and violent struggle ensued, in which the people of Rome and of
                    other Italian cities sided so vigorously with the popes that John VI. (701-5)
                    had to interpose in order to release the exarch from captivity and prevent a
                    definitive rupture with the empire. Then (710-n) Ravenna revolted against the
                    emperor, organized its armed population under twelve flags, and almost all the
                    cities of the exarchate joined in a resistance that was the first step towards
                    the independence of the Italian communes. A still fiercer religious quarrel then
                    broke out concerning images. Pope Gregory II. (715-31) opposed the celebrated
                    edict of the iconoclastic emperor Leo the Isaurian.</p>               <p>Venice and the Pentapolis took up arms in favour of the pope, and elected dukes
                    of their own without applying to the emperor. Again public disorder rose to such
                    a pitch that the pope was obliged to check it lest it should go too far.</p>               <p>In the midst of these warlike tumults a new constitution, almost a new state,
                    was being set up in Rome. During the conflict with Philippicus, the Monothelite
                    and heretical emperor who ascended the throne in 711, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Liber Pontificalis</hi> makes the first mention of the duchy of Rome <hi
                        rend="italic">(ducatus Romanae urbis),</hi> and we find the people
                    struggling to elect a duke of their own. In the early days of the Byzantine rule
                    the territory appertaining to the city was no greater than under the Roman
                    Empire. But, partly through the weakness of the government of Constantinople,
                    and above all through the decomposition of the Italian provinces under the
                    Lombards, who destroyed all unity of government in the peninsula, this dukedom
                    was widely extended, and its limits were always changing in accordance with the
                    course of events. It was watered by the Tiber, and stretched into Tuscia to the
                    right, starting from the mouth of the Marta, by Tolfa and Bleda, and reaching as
                    far as Orte. Viterbo was a frontier city of the Lombards. On the left the duchy
                    extended into Latium as far as the Garigliano. It spread very little to the
                    north-east and was badly defended on that side, inasmuch as the duchy of Spoleto
                    reached to within fourteen miles of the Salara gate. On the other side, towards
                    Umbria, the river Nera was its boundary line.</p>               <p>The constitution of the city now begins to show the results of the conditions
                    amid which it took shape. The separation of the civil from the military power
                    has entirely disappeared. This is proved by the fact that, after the year 600,
                    there is no further mention of the prefect.</p>               <p>His office still survived, but with a gradual change of functions, until, in the
                    8th century, he once more appears as president of a criminal tribunal. The
                    constitution of the duchy and of the new republic formed during the wars with
                    the Lombards and the exarch was substantially of an aristocratico-military
                    nature. At its head was the duke, first appointed by the emperor, then by the
                    pope and the people, and, as his strength and influence grew with those of the
                    commune, he gradually became the most respected and powerful personage in Rome.
                    The duke inhabited the palace of the Caesars on the Palatine Hill, and had both
                    the civil and the military power in his hands; he was at the head of the army,
                    which, being composed of the best citizens and highest nobility of Rome, was a
                    truly national force. This army was styled the <hi rend="italic"
                        >felicissimus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">florens exercitus Romanns</hi> or
                    also the <hi rend="italic">militia Romana.</hi> Its members never lost their
                    citizen stamp; on the contrary they formed the true body of the citizens. We
                    find mention of other <hi rend="italic">duces</hi> in Rome, but these were
                    probably other leaders or superior officers of the army. Counts and tribunes are
                    found in the subject cities bound to furnish aid to the capital. In fact during
                    the pontificate of Sergius II. (844), when the duchy was threatened by a
                    Saracenic invasion, they were requested to send troops to defend the coast, and
                    as many soldiers as possible to the city.</p>               <p>At that time the inhabitants of Rome were divided into four principal
                    classes—clergy, nobles, soldiers and simple citizens. The nobles were divided
                    into two categories, first the genuine <hi rend="italic">optimates, i.e.</hi>
                    members of old and wealthy families with large estates, and filling high, and
                    often hereditary, offices in the state, the church and the army. These were
                    styled <hi rend="italic">proceres</hi> and <hi rend="italic">primates.</hi> The
                    second category comprised landed proprietors, of moderate means but exalted
                    position, mentioned as <hi rend="italic">nobiles</hi> by Gregory I., and
                    constituting in fact a numerous petty nobility and the bulk of the army. Next
                    followed the citizen?, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> the commercial class,
                    merchants and craftsmen, who, having as yet no fixed organization and but little
                    influence, were simply designated as <hi rend="italic">honesti cives.</hi>
                    These, however, were quite distinct from the plebeians, <hi rend="italic">plebs,
                        vulgus popidi, viri humiles,</hi> who in their turn ranked above bondsmen
                    and slaves. The <hi rend="italic">honesti cives</hi> did not</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0663" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0710.jp2"/>
               <p>usually form part of the army, and were only enrolled in it in seasons of
                    emergency. Nevertheless the army was not only national, but became increasingly
                    democratic, so that in the ioth century it included every class of inhabitants
                    except churchmen and slaves. At that period we sometimes find the whole people
                    designated as the <hi rend="italic">exercitus,</hi> those actually under arms
                    being distinguished as the <hi rend="italic">militia exercitus Romani.</hi> This
                    again was divided into bands or ‘‘numbers,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>
                    regiments, and also, in a manner peculiar to Rome, into <hi rend="italic"
                        >scholae militum.</hi> These <hi rend="italic">scholae</hi> were
                    associations derived from antiquity, gaining strength and becoming more general
                    in the middle ages as the central power of the state declined.</p>               <p>There were <hi rend="italic">scholae</hi> of notaries, of church singers, and of
                    nearly every leading employment; there were <hi rend="italic">scholae</hi> of
                    foreigners of diverse nationalities, of Franks, Lombards, Greeks, Saxons,
                    &amp;c. Even the trades and crafts began to form <hi rend="italic"
                        >scholae.</hi> These were at first very feeble institutions, and only later
                    gained importance and became gilds. As early as the 8th century there were <hi
                        rend="italic">scholae militum</hi> in the army, which was thus doubly
                    divided. But we have no precise definition of their functions. They were <hi
                        rend="italic">de facto</hi> corporations with separate property, churches
                    and magistrates of their own. The latter were always <hi rend="italic"
                        >optimates,</hi> and guarded the interests of the army. But the real chiefs
                    of the bands or <hi rend="italic">numeri</hi> were the <hi rend="italic"
                        >duces</hi> or tribunes, and under the Franks the latter became <hi
                        rend="italic">comités.</hi> These chiefs were styled <hi rend="italic"
                        >magnifici consules, optimates de militia</hi> , often too <hi rend="italic"
                        >judices de militiaj</hi> since, as was the custom of the middle ages, they
                    wielded political and judicial as well as military authority. The title of
                    consul was now generally given to superior officers, whether civil or military.
                    The importance of the <hi rend="italic">scholae militum</hi> began to decline in
                    the ioth century; towards the middle of the 12th they disappeared altogether,
                    and, according to Felix Papencordt, were last mentioned in 1145. It is probable
                    that the <hi rend="italic">scholae militum</hi> signified local divisions of the
                    army, corresponding with the city wards, which were twelve in number during the
                    ioth and nth centuries, then increased to thirteen, and occasionally to
                    fourteen. It is certain that from the beginning the army was distributed under
                    twelve flags; after the <hi rend="italic">scholae</hi> had disappeared, we find
                    it classified in districts, which were subdivided into companies. The division
                    of cities into quarters, <hi rend="italic">sestieri</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >rioni,</hi> corresponding with that of the army, and also with that of the
                    municipal government, was the common practice of Florence, Siena and almost all
                    the Italian communes. But, while usually losing importance as the gilds acquired
                    power, in Rome the insignificance of the gilds added to the strength of the <hi
                        rend="italic">regioni</hi> or <hi rend="italic">rioni,</hi> which not only
                    became part of the army but finally grasped the reins of government. This was a
                    special characteristic of the political constitution of the Roman commune.</p>               <p>We now come to a question of weightier import for all desiring to form a clear
                    idea of the Roman government at that period.</p>               <p>What had become of the senate ? It had undoubtedly lost its original character
                    now that the empire was extinct. But, after much learned discussion, historical
                    authorities are still divided upon the subject. Certain Italian writers of the
                    18th century—Vendettini, for example—asserted with scanty critical insight that
                    the Roman senate did not disappear in the middle ages. The same opinion backed
                    by much learned research was maintained by the gréât German historian Savigny.
                    And Leo, while denying the persistence of the curia in Lombard Italy, adhered to
                    Savigny’s views as regarded Rome. Papencordt did the same, but held the Roman
                    senate to be no more than a curia. This judgment was vigorously contested, first
                    by Hegel and Giesebrecht, then by Gregorovius. These writers believe that after
                    the middle of the 6th century the senate had a merely nominal existence.
                    According to Gregorovius its last appearance was in the year 579. After that
                    date it is mentioned in no documents, and the chroniclers are either equally
                    silent or merely allude to its decay and extinction. In the 8th century,
                    however, the terms <hi rend="italic">senator, senatores, senatus</hi> again
                    reappear. Wc find letters addressed to Pippin, beginning thus: <hi rend="italic"
                        >Omnis senatus atque universi populi generalitas.</hi> When Leo III.
                    returned from Germany he was met by <hi rend="italic">tarn proceres clericorum
                        cum omnibus clericis, quamque optimates ei senatus, cunctaque militia</hi>
                    (see Anastasius, in Muratori, vol. iii. 198c). But it has been noted that the
                    senate was never found to act as a political assembly; on occasions when it
                    might have been mentioned in that capacity we hear nothing of it, and only meet
                    with it in ceremonials and purely formal functions/ Hence the conclusion that
                    the term <hi rend="italic">senator</hi> was used in the sense of noble, <hi
                        rend="italic">senatus</hi> of nobility, and no longer referred to an
                    institution hut only to a class of the citizens. Even when we find that the
                    emperor Otto III. (who sought to revive all the ancient institutions of Rome)
                    addressed an edict to the “ consuls and senate of Rome,” and read that the laws
                    of St Stephen were issued <hi rend="italic">senatus decreto,</hi> the learned
                    Giesebrecht merely remarks that no important changes in the Roman constitution
                    are to be attributed to the consuls and senate introduced by Otto III. Thus for
                    the next glimpse of the senate we must pass to the 12th century, when it was not
                    only reformed, as some writers believe, but entirely reconstituted.</p>               <p>But in this case a serious difficulty remains to be disposed of. Gregorovius
                    firmly asserts that the nobles acquired great power between the 7th and ioth
                    centuries, not only filling the highest military, judicial and ecclesiastical
                    offices, “ but also directing the municipal government, presumably with the
                    prefect at their head.” He further adds: “ Notwithstanding the disappearance of
                    the senate, it is difficult to suppose that the city was without governing
                    magistrates, or without a council.” Thus, after the 7th century, tlje <hi
                        rend="italic">optimates</hi> at the head of the army were also at the head
                    of the citizens, and “ formed a communal council in the same manner in which it
                    was afterwards formed by the <hi rend="italic">banderesi”</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="709"> , <hi
                            rend="italic">Geschickte,</hi> vol. ii. pp. 427-28 and note (2nd ed.).
                    </note> Now, if the nobles were called <hi rend="italic">senatores</hi> and the
                    nobility <hi rend="italic">senatus,</hi> and if this body of nobles met in
                    council to administer the affairs of the republic, there is no matter for
                    dispute, inasmuch as all are agreed that the original senate must have had a
                    different character from the senate of the middle ages. And, since the absence
                    of all mention of a prefect after the 7 th century is not accepted as a proof of
                    his non-existence, and we find him reappear under another form in the 8th
                    century, so the silence as to the senate after the year 579, the fresh mention
                    of it in the 8th century, and its reappearance in the 12th as a firmly
                    reconstituted body reasonably lead to the inference that, during that time, the
                    ancient senate had been gradually transformed into the new council. Its meetings
                    must have been held very irregularly, and probably only in emergencies when
                    important affairs had to be discussed, previously to bringing them before the
                    parliament or general assembly of the people. Historians are better agreed as to
                    the significance of the term <hi rend="italic">consul.</hi> At first this was
                    simply a title of honour bestowed on superior magistrates, and retained that
                    meaning from the 7th to the nth century, but then became—as mother Italian
                    cities—a special title of the chief officers of the state.</p>               <p>During this period the Roman constitution was very simple. The duke, commanding
                    the army, and the prefect, presiding over the criminal court, were the chiefs of
                    the republic; the armed nobility constituted the forces, filled all of superior
                    offices, and occasionally met in a council called the senate, although it had,
                    as we have said, no resemblance to the senate of older times. In moments of
                    emergency a general parliament of the people was convoked. This constitution
                    differed little from that of the other Italian communes, where, in the same way,
                    we find all the leading citizens under arms, a parliament, a council, and one or
                    more chiefs at the head of the government.</p>               <p>But Rome had an element that was lacking elsewhere. We have already noted that,
                    in the provinces, the administrators of church lands were important personages,
                    and exercised during the middle ages, when there was no exact division of power,
                    both judicial and political functions. It was very natural that the heads of
                    this vast administration resident in Rome should have a still higher standing,
                    and in fact, from the</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0664" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0711.jp2"/>
               <p>6th century, their power increased to such an extent that in the times of the
                    Franks they already formed a species of papal cabinet with a share and sometimes
                    a predominance in the affairs of the republic. There were seven principal
                    administrators, but two of them held the chief power— the <hi rend="italic"
                        >primicerius notariorum</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">secundicerius,
                        i.e.</hi> the first and under secretaries of state. When, on the
                    constitution of the new empire, these ministers were declared to be palatine or
                    imperial as well as papal officials, the <hi rend="italic">primicerius</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">secundicerius</hi> were also in waiting on the emperor,
                    who sat in council with them when in Rome. Next came the <hi rend="italic"
                        >arcarius,</hi> or treasurer ; the <hi rend="italic">sacellarius,</hi> or
                    cashier; the <hi rend="italic">protoscriniarius,</hi> who was at the head of the
                    papal chancery; the <hi rend="italic">primus defensor,</hi> who was the advocate
                    of the church and administered its possessions. Seventh and last came the <hi
                        rend="italic">nomenclátor, or adminicutator,</hi> who pleaded the cause of
                    widows, orphans and paupers. There were also some other officials, such as the
                        <hi rend="italic">vestiarius,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">vicedominus</hi> or
                    steward, the <hi rend="italic">cubicularius</hi> or major-domo, hut these were
                    of inferior importance. They were ecclesiastics, but not bound to be in priest’s
                    orders. The first seven were those specially known as <hi rend="italic">proceres
                        clericorum</hi> and oftener still as <hi rend="italic">judices de
                        clero,</hi> since they speedily assumed judicial functions and ranked among
                    the chief judges of Rome.</p>               <p>But as ecclesiastics they did not give decisions in criminal cases. Thus Rome
                    had two tribunals, that of the <hi rend="italic">judices de clero,</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">ordinarii,</hi> presided over by the pope, and that of the <hi
                        rend="italic">judices de militia,</hi> leaders of the army, dukes and
                    tribunes, also bearing the generic title of consuls. First appointed by the
                    exarch and then frequently by the pope, these decided both civil and criminal
                    cases. In the latter they were sole judges under the presidency of the prefect.
                    .</p>               <p>The pope was thus at the head of a large administrative body with judicial and
                    civil powers that were continually on the increase, and, in addition to his
                    moral authority over Christendom, was possessed of enormous revenues. So in
                    course of time he considered himself the real representative of the Roman
                    Republic. Gregory II.</p>               <p>(715-31) accepted in the name of the republic the submission of other cities,
                    and protested against the conquest by the Lombards of those already belonging to
                    Rome. He seemed indeed to regard the territory of the duchy as the patrimony of
                    the church. The duke was always at the head of the army, and, officially, was
                    always held to be an imperial magistrate. But the empire was now powerless in
                    Italy. Meanwhile the advance of the Lombards was becoming more and more
                    threatening; they seized Ravenna in 751, thus putting an end to the exarchate,
                    and next marched towards Rome, which had only its own forces and the aid of
                    neighbouring cities to rely upon. To avoid being crushed by the brute force of a
                    foreign nation unfit to rule, and only capable of oppression and pillage, it was
                    necessary to make an energetic stand.</p>               <p>Accordingly, the reigning pope, Stephen II. (752-57), appealed to Pippin, king
                    of the Franks, and concluded with that monarch an alliance destined to
                    inaugurate a new epoch of the world’s history. The pope consecrated Pippin king
                    of the Franks, and named him <hi rend="italic">patricius Romanorum.</hi> This
                    title, as introduced by Constantine, had no longer the ancient meaning,but now
                    became asign of lofty social rank. When, however, it was afterwards conferred on
                    barbarian chieftains such as Odoacer and Theodoric, and then on the
                    representative of the Byzantine empire in Italy, it acquired the meaning of a
                    definite dignity or office. In fact, the title was now given to Pippin as
                    defender of the church, for the pope styled him at the same time <hi
                        rend="italic">patricius Romanorum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">defensor</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">protector eedesiae.</hi> And the king pledged himself not
                    only to defend the church but also to wrest the exarchate and the Pentapolis
                    from the Lombards and give them to Rome, or rather to the pope, which came to
                    the same thing. This was considered as a restitution made to the head of the
                    church, who was also the representative of the republic and the empire. And, to
                    preserve the character of a restitution, the famous “ donation of Constantine
                    was invented during this period (752-77). Pippin brought his army to the rescue
                    (754-55) and fulfilled his promise.</p>               <p>The pope accepted the donation in the name of St Peter, and as the visible head
                    of the church. Thus in 755 central Italy broke its connexion with the empire and
                    became independent; thus was inaugurated the temporal power of the papacy, the
                    cause of so much subsequent warfare and revolution in Rome.</p>               <p>Its first consequences were speedily seen. In 767 the death of Paul I. was
                    followed by a fierce revolt of the nobles under Duke To to (Theodoro) of Nepi,
                    who by violent means raised his brother Constantine to the chair of St Peter,
                    although Constantine was a layman and had first to be ordained. For more than a
                    year the new pontiff was a pliable tool in the hands of Toto and of the nobles.
                    But the genuine papal faction, headed by a few <hi rend="italic">judices de
                        clero,</hi> asked the aid of the Lombards and made a formidable resistance.
                    Their adversaries were defeated, tortured and put to death. Toto was
                    treacherously slain during a fight. The pope was blinded and left half dead on
                    the highway. Fresh and no less violent riots ensued, owing to the public dread
                    lest the new pope, Stephen III. (768-72), elected by favour of the Lombards,
                    should give them the city in return. But Stephen went over to the Franks, whom
                    he had previously deserted, and his successor, Adrian I. (772-95), likewise
                    adhered to their cause, called the city to arms to resist King Desiderius and
                    his Lombard hordes, and besought the assistance of Charlemagne. This monarch
                    accordingly made a descent into Italy in 773, and not only gained an easy
                    victory over Desiderius, but destroyed the Lombard kingdom and seized the iron
                    crown. Entering Rome for the first time in 774, he confirmed and augmented the
                    donation of Pippin by the addition of the dukedom of Spoleto. He returned
                    several times to Italy and Rome, making new conquests and fresh concessions to
                    Adrian I., until the death of the latter in 795.</p>               <p>The position of Rome and of the pope is now substantially changed. Duke,
                    prefect, militia and the people exist as heretofore, but are all subordinate to
                    the head of the church, who, by the donations of Pippin and Charlemagne, has
                    been converted into a powerful temporal sovereign. Henceforth all connexion with
                    Byzantium is broken off, but Rome is still the mainspring of the empire, the
                    Roman duchy its sole surviving fragment in Italy, and the pope stands before the
                    world as representative of both. And, although it is difficult to determine how
                    this came about, the pope is now regarded and regards himself as master of Rome.
                    In the year 772 he entrusts the <hi rend="italic">vestiarius</hi> with judicial
                    powers over the laity, ecclesiastics, freemen and slaves <hi rend="italic"
                        >nostrae Romanae reipublicae.</hi> He writes to Charlemagne that he has
                    issued orders for the burning of the Greek ships employed in the slave trade, “
                    in our city of Civita Vecchia ” (Centumcellae), and he always speaks of Rome and
                    the Romans as “ our city,” <hi rend="sup">a</hi> our republic,” “ our people.”
                    The donations of Pippin and Charlemagne are restitutions made to St Peter, the
                    holy church and the republic at the same time. It is true that Charlemagne held
                    the supreme power, had an immensely increased authority and actively fulfilled
                    his duties as <hi rend="italic">patricius.</hi> But his powxr was only
                    occasionally exercised in Rome; it was the result of services rendered to the
                    church, and of the church’s continual need of his help; it was, as it were, the
                    power of a mighty and indispensable ally. The pope, however, was most tenacious
                    of his own authority in Rome, made vigorous protest whenever rebels fled to
                    Charlemagne or appealed to that monarch’s arbitration, and contested the
                    supremacy of the imperial officials in Rome. Yet the pope was no absolute
                    sovereign, nor, in the modern sense of the term, did any then exist. He asserted
                    supremacy over many lands which continually rebelled against him, and which, for
                    want of an army of his own, he was unable to reduce to obedience without others’
                    help. Neither did the republic acknowledge him as its head. It profited by</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0665" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0712.jp2"/>
               <p>the growing power of the pope, could not exist without him, respected his moral
                    authority, but considered that he usurped undue power in Rome. This was
                    specially the feeling of the nobles, who had hitherto held the chief authority
                    in the republic, and, being still the leaders of the army, were by no means
                    willing to relinquish it. The Roman nobles were very different from other
                    aristocratic bodies elsewhere. They were not as they pretended, descendants of
                    the Camilli and the Scipios, but neither were they a feudal aristocracy,
                    inasmuch as the Teutonic element had as yet made small way among them. They were
                    a mixture of different elements, national and foreign, formed by the special
                    conditions of Rome. Their power was chiefly derived from the high offices and
                    large grants of money and land conferred on them by the popes; but, as no
                    dynasty existed, they could not be dynastic. Every pope aggrandized his own
                    kindred and friends, and these were the natural and often open adversaries of
                    the next pontiff and his favourites. Thus the Roman nobility was powerful,
                    divided, restless and turbulent; it was continually plotting against the pope,
                    threatening not only his power, but even his life; it continually appealed to
                    the people for assistance, stirred the militia to revolt and rendered government
                    an impossibility. Hence, notwithstanding his immense moral authority, the pope
                    was the effective head neither of the aristocracy, the army nor of the as yet
                    unorganized lower classes. The lord of vast but often insubordinate territories,
                    the recognized master of a capital city torn by internecine feud and plots
                    against himself, he needed the support of an effective force for his own
                    preservation and the maintenance of the authority proffered him from all
                    quarters. Hence the necessity of creating an empire of the West, after having
                    snapped every link with that of the East. Thus the history of Rome is still, as
                    in the past, a history of continual strife between pope, emperor and republic;
                    and the city, while imbibing strength from all three, keeps them in perpetual
                    tumult and confusion.</p>               <p>Leo III. (796-816) further strengthened the ties between Charlemagne and the
                    church by sending the former a letter with the keys of the shrine of St Peter
                    and the banner of Rome. Charlemagne had already joined to his office of
                    patrician the function of high justice. The new symbols now sent constituted him
                        <hi rend="italic">miles</hi> of Rome and general of the church. The pope
                    urged him to despatch an envoy to receive the oath of fealty, thus placing
                    himself, the representative of the republic, in the subordinate position of one
                    of the bishops who had received the immunities of counts. And all these
                    arrangements took place without the slightest reference to the senate, the army
                    or the people. Much resentment was felt, especially by the nobles, and a
                    revolution ensued headed by the Paschalis and the <hi rend="italic"
                        >secundicerius</hi> Campulus, and backed by all who wished to liberate the
                    city from the papal rule. During a solemn procession the pope was attacked and
                    barbarously maltreated by his assailants, who tried to tear out his eyes and
                    tongue (799). He was thrown into prison, escaped and overtook Charlemagne at
                    Paderborn, and returned guarded by ten of the monarch’s envoys, who condemned to
                    death the leaders of the revolt, reserving, however, to their sovereign the
                    right of final judgment. Charlemagne arrived in December 800, and as high
                    justice assembled a tribunal of. the clergy, nobles, citizens and Franks; he
                    pronounced Leo to be innocent, and confirmed the capital sentence passed on the
                    rebels. But through the intercession of the pope, who dreaded the wrath of the
                    nobles, this was presently commuted into perpetual exile. And finally on
                    Christmas day, in St Peter’s, before an assemblage of Roman and Frankish lords,
                    the clergy and the people, the pontiff placed the imperial crown on</p>               <p>Charlemagne’s head and all proclaimed him emperor.</p>               <p>Thus the new emperor was elected by the Romans and consecrated by the pope. But
                    he was their real master and supreme judge. The pope existed only by his will,
                    since he alone supplied the means for the maintenance of the temporal power, and
                    already pretended to the right of controlling the papal elections. Yet
                    Charlemagne was not sovereign of Rome; he possessed scarcely any regalia there,
                    and was not in command of the army; he mainly represented a principle, but this
                    principle was the law which is the basis of the state. The pope still nominated
                    the Roman judges, but the emperor or his <hi rend="italic">missi</hi> presided
                    over them, together with those of the pope, and his decision was appealed to in
                    last resort. During the Carolingian times no mention is found of the prefect,
                    and it would seem that his office was filled by the imperial <hi rend="italic"
                        >missus,</hi> or legate, the <hi rend="italic">judices de clero</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">judices de militia.</hi> The power of the pope was now
                    entangled with that of the republic on the one hand and that of the empire on
                    the other. The consequent confusion of sacred and secular functions naturally
                    led to infinite complications and disputes.</p>               <p>The death of Charlemagne in 814 was the signal for a fresh conspiracy of the
                    nobles against the pope, who, discovering their design, instantly put the
                    ringleaders to death, and was severely blamed by Louis for this violation of the
                    imperial prerogative. While the matter was under discussion the nobles broke out
                    in fiercer tumults, both in Rome and the Campagna. At last, in 824, the emperor
                    Lothair came to reestablish order in Rome, and proclaimed a new and noteworthy
                    constitution, to which Pope Eugcnius 11. (824-27) gave his
                    oath of adherence. By this the partnership of pope and emperor in the temporal
                    rule of Rome and the states of the church was again confirmed. The more direct
                    power appertained to the pope; the supreme authority, presidence of the
                    tribunals, and final judgment on appeal to the emperor. The new constitution
                    also established the right of contending parties to select either the Roman or
                    the Teutonic code for the settlement of their disputes.- During the Carolingian
                    period it is not surprising that the commune should have been, as it were,
                    absorbed by the church and the empire. In fact, it is scarcely mentioned in
                    history throughout that time. And when, no longer sustained by the genius of its
                    founder, the Frankish empire began to show signs of dissolution, the popes,
                    finding their power thereby strengthened, began to assume many of the imperial
                    attributes. Soon, however, as a natural consequence of the loss of the main
                    support of the papacy, the nobles regained vigour and were once more masters of
                    the city. Teutonic and feudal elements had now largely penetrated into their
                    organization. The system of granting lands, and even churches and convents, as
                    benefices according to feudal forms, became more and more general. It was vain
                    for the popes to offer opposition, and they ended by yielding to the current.
                    The fall of the Frankish empire left all Italy a prey to anarchy, and tom by the
                    faction fights of Berengar of Friuli and Guido of Spoleto, the rival claimants
                    to the crowns of Italy and the empire. The Saracens were advancing from the
                    south, the Huns from the north; the popes had lost all power; and in the midst
                    of this frightful chaos a way was opened for the rise of the republics. Anarchy
                    was at its climax in Rome, but the laity began to overpower the clergy to such
                    an extent that the <hi rend="italic">judices de militia</hi> prevailed over the
                        <hi rend="italic">judices de clero.</hi> For a long time no imperial <hi
                        rend="italic">missi</hi> or legates had been seen, and the papacy was
                    incredibly lowered. The election of the popes had positively fallen into the
                    hands of certain beautiful women notorious for their evil life and depravity.
                    The aristocracy alone gained strength; now freed from the domination of the
                    emperor, it continually wrested fresh privileges from the impotent pontiffs, and
                    became organized as the ruling force of the republic. Gregorovius,
                    notwithstanding his denial of the continuation of the senate after the 6th
                    century, is obliged to acknowledge that it appeared to have returned to life in
                    the power of this new baronage. And, although this body was now permeated with
                    the feudal principle, it did not discard its ancient traditions. The nobles
                    claimed to be the main source of the empire; they wished to regain the dignity
                    and office of <hi rend="italic">patricius,</hi> and to make it, if possible,
                    hereditary in some of their families. Nothing is known of their system of
                    organization, but it seems</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0666" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0713.jp2"/>
               <p>that they elected a chief bearing the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">consul, senator, princeps Romano rum,</hi> who was officially
                    recognized by the pope, as a <hi rend="italic">patricius</hi> presided over the
                    tribunals, and was the head of the commune.</p>               <p>Theophylact was one of the first to assume this dignity. His wife Theodora,
                    known as the <hi rend="italic">senatrix,</hi> was one of the women then
                    dominating Rome by force of their charms and licentiousness. She was supposed to
                    be the concubine of Pope John X. (914-28), whose election was due to her
                    influence. Her daughter Marozia, in all things her worthy rival, was married to
                    Alberic, a foreign mercenary of uncertain birth who rose to a position of great
                    influence, and, although an alien, played a leading part in the affairs of the
                    city. He helped to increase the power of Theophylact, who seemingly shared the
                    rule of the city with the pope. In the bloody war that had to be waged against
                    the Saracens of southern Italy, and at the defeat of the latter on the
                    Garigliano (916), Theophylact and Alberic were the Roman leaders, and
                    distinguished themselves by their valour. They disappeared from the scene after
                    this victory, but Marozia retained her power, and bore a son, Alberic, who was
                    destined to greater deeds. The pope found himself caught in this woman’s toils,
                    and struggled to escape, but Marozia, gaining fresh influence by her marriage
                    with Hugo, margrave of Tuscany, imprisoned the pontiff himself in the castle of
                    St Angelo (928). This fortress was the property of Marozia and the basis of her
                    strength. The unfortunate John died within its walls. Raised to the chair by
                    Theodora, he was deposed and killed by her daughter. The authority of the latter
                    reached its Culminating point in 931, when she succeeded in placing her son John
                    XI. on the papal throne. On the death of her second husband she espoused Hugh of
                    Provence, the same who in 928 had seized the iron crown at Pavia, and now
                    aspired to the empire. Dissolute, ambitious and despotic, he came to Rome in
                    932, and, leaving his army outside the walls, entered the castle of St Angelo
                    with his knights, instantly began to play the tyrant, and gave a blow to Alberic
                    his stepson, who detested him as a foreign intruder. This blow proved the cause
                    of a memorable revolution; for Alberic rushed from the castle and harangued the
                    people, crying that the time was come to shake off the tyrannous yoke of a woman
                    and of barbarians who were once the slaves of Rome. Then, putting himself at the
                    head of the populace, he closed the city gates to prevent Hugh’s troops from
                    coming to the rescue, and attacked the castle. The king fled; Marozia was
                    imprisoned, Alberic proclaimed lord of the Romans, and the pope confined to the
                    Lateran in the custody of his own brother. Rome was again an independent state,
                    a republic of nobles. Rid of the temporal dominion of emperor and pope, and
                    having expelled the foreigners with great energy and courage, it chose Alberic
                    for its chief with the title of <hi rend="italic">princeps atque omnium Rom
                        anorum senator.</hi> The tendency of the Roman Republic to elect a supreme
                    authority, first manifested in the case of Theophylact, was repeated in those of
                    Alberic, Brancaleone, Crescenzio, Cola di Rienzo and others. One of the many
                    causes of this tendency may be traced to the conception of the new empire of
                    which Rome was the original and enduring fountainhead. As Rome had once
                    transferred the empire from Byzantium to the Franks, so Rome was surely entitled
                    to reclaim it. The imperial authority was represented by the office of
                    patrician, now virtually assumed by Alberic. That he gave the name of Oct avian
                    to his son is an additional proof of this fact. In the Eternal City the medieval
                    political idea has always the aspect of a resurrection or transformation of
                    classic antiquity. This is another characteristic</p>               <p>of the history of the Roman commune.</p>               <p>Alberic’s strength was due to his connexion with the nobility, to his father’s
                    valiant service against the Saracens at the battle of Garigliano, and to the
                    militia under his command, on which everything depended amid the internal and
                    external dangers now threatening the new state. As yet no genuine municipal
                    constitution was possible in Rome, where neither the people nor the wealthy
                    burghers engaged in industry and commerce had any fixed organization. All was in
                    the hands of the nobles, and Alberic. as their chief, frequently convened them
                    in council, although obliged to use pressure to keep them united and avoid
                    falling a prey to their disputes. Hence the whole power was concentrated in his
                    grasp; he was at the head of the tribunals as well as of the army. The <hi
                        rend="italic">judices de clero</hi> and <hi rend="italic">judices de
                        militia</hi> still existed, but no longer met in the Lateran or the Vatican,
                    under the presidency of emperor and pope or their <hi rend="italic">mis si.</hi>
                    Alberic himself was their president; and, a still more significant fact, their
                    sittings were often held in his private dwelling. There is no longer any mention
                    of prefect or <hi rend="italic">patricius.</hi> The papal coinage was inscribed
                    with Alberic’s name instead of the emperor’s. His chief attention was given to
                    the militia, which was still arranged in <hi rend="italic">scholae,</hi> and it
                    is highly probable that he was the author of the new division of the city into
                    twelve <hi rend="italic">regions,</hi> with a corresponding classification of
                    the army in as many regiments under twelve flags and twelve <hi rend="italic"
                        >banderesi,</hi> one for every region. The organization of the <hi
                        rend="italic">scholae</hi> could not have been very dissimilar, but
                    doubtless Alberic had some important motive for altering the old method of
                    classification. By means of the armed regions he included the people in the
                    forces. It is certain that after his time we find the army much changed and far
                    more democratic. It was only natural that so excellent a statesman should seek
                    the aid of the popular element as a defence against the arrogance of the nobles,
                    and it was requisite to reinforce the army in order to be prepared for the
                    attacks threatened from abroad. This change effected, Alberic felt prepared for
                    the worst, and began to rule with energy, moderation and justice. His
                    contemporaries award him high praise, and he seems to have been exempt from the
                    vices of his mother and grandmother.</p>               <p>In 933 Hugh made his first attack upon the city, and was repulsed. A second
                    attempt in 936 proved still more unfortunate, for his army was decimated by a
                    pestilence. Thoroughly disheartened, he not only made peace, but gave his
                    daughter in marriage to Alberic, thus satisfying the latter’s desire to ally
                    himself with a royal house. But this union led to no conciliation with Hugh. For
                    Alberic, finding his power increased, marched at the head of his troops to
                    consolidate his rule in the Cam-pagna and the Sabine land. On the death of his
                    brother, Pope John XI., in 936, he controlled the election of several successive
                    popes, quelled a conspiracy formed against him by the clergy and certain nobles
                    instigated by Hugh, and brilliantly repulsed, in 941, another attack by that
                    potentate. At last, however, this inveterate foe withdrew from Rome, being
                    summoned to the north by the victories of his rival Berengarius. But' Alberic,
                    after procuring the election of various popes who were docile instruments of his
                    ’will, experienced a check when Agapetus II. (946-55), a man of firmness and
                    resource, was raised to the papal throne. The fortunes of Berengarius were now
                    in the ascendant. In 950 he had seized the iron crown, and ruled in the
                    Pentapolis and the exarchate. This being singularly painful to the pope, he
                    proceeded to make alliance with all those enemies of Berengarius preferring a
                    distant emperor to a neighbouring and effective sovereign, with the Roman nobles
                    who were discontented with Alberic, and with all who foresaw danger, even to
                    Rome, from the extended power of Berengarius. And Agapetus recurred to the old
                    papal policy, by making appeal to Otto I., whose rule in Germany was
                    distinguished by a prestige almost comparable with that of Charlemagne.</p>               <p>Otto immediately responded to the appeal and descended into Italy; but his
                    envoys were indignantly repulsed by Alberic, and, being prudent as well as firm,
                    he decided to wait a more opportune moment for the accomplishment of his
                    designs. Meanwhile Alberic died in 954, and the curtain fell on the first great
                    drama of the Roman Republic. He had reigned for twenty-two years with justice,
                    energy and prudence; he had repelled foreign invaders, maintained order and
                    authority. He seems, however, to have realized that the aspect of affairs was
                    about to change, that the work he had accomplished would be exposed to new
                    dangers. These dangers, in fact, had already begun with the accession of an
                    enterprising pope to the Holy</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0667" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0714.jp2"/>
               <p>See. The name of Octavian given by Alberic to his son leads to the inference
                    that he meant to make his power hereditary. But, suddenly, he began to educate
                    this son for the priesthood, and, assembling the nobles in St Peter’s shortly
                    before his death, he made them swear to elect Octavian as pope on the decease of
                    Agapetus IL They kept their word, for in this way they freed themselves from a
                    ruler. Possibly Alberic trusted that both offices might be united, and that his
                    son would be head of the state as well as the church. But the nobles knew this
                    to be a delusion, especially in the case of a nature such as Octavian’s. The lad
                    was sixteen years old when his father died, received princely honours until the
                    death of Agapetus, and was then elected pope with the name of John XII. He had
                    inherited the ungoverned passions of his grandmother Marozia and
                    great-grandmother Theodora, but without their intelligence and cunning. His
                    palace was the scene of the most scandalous licence, while his public acts were
                    those of a baby tyrant. He conferred a bishopric on a child of ten, consecrated
                    a deacon in a stable, invoked Venus and Jupiter in his games, and drank to the
                    devil’s health. He desired to be both pope and prince, but utterly failed to be
                    either. Before long, realizing the impossibility of holding in check
                    Berengarius, who still ruled over the exarchate, he sought in 960 the aid of
                    Otto I., and promised him the imperial crown. Thus the new ruler was summoned by
                    the son of the man by whom he had been repulsed. Otto vowed to defend the
                    church, to restore her territories, to refrain from usurping the power of the
                    pope or the republic, and was crowned on the 2nd of February 962 with unheard-of
                    pomp and display.</p>               <p>Accordingly, after being extinct for thirty-seven years, the empire was revived
                    under different but no less difficult conditions. The politico-religious unity
                    founded by Charlemagne had been dissolved, partly on account of the
                    heterogeneous elements of which it was composed, and partly because, other
                    nations were in course of formation. Now too the feudal system was converting
                    the officers of the empire into independent princes, and the new spirit of
                    communal liberty was giving freedom to the cities. Otto once more united the
                    empire and the church, Italy and Germany, in order to combat these new foes. But
                    the difficulties of the enterprise at once came to light. John XII., finding a
                    master in the protector he had invoked, now joined the discontented nobles who
                    were conspiring with Berengarius against the emperor. But the latter hastened to
                    Rome in November 963, assembled the clergy, nobles and heads of the people, and
                    made them take an oath never again to elect a pope without his consent and that
                    of his son. He also convoked a synod presided over by himself in St Peter’s,
                    which judged, condemned and deposed Pope John and elected</p>               <p>Leo VIII. (863-65), a Roman noble, in his stead. All this was done at the direct
                    bidding of the emperor, who thus deprived the Romans of their most valued
                    privilege, the right of choosing their own pope. But the people had now risen to
                    considerable importance, and, for the first time, we find it officially
                    represented in the synod by the plebeian Pietro, surnamed Imperiola, together
                    with tbe leaders of the militia, which had also become a popular institution
                    since Alberic’s reign. It was no longer easy to keep the lower orders in
                    subjection, and by their junction with the malcontent nobles they formed a very
                    respectable force. On the 3rd of January 964 they sounded the battle-peal and
                    attacked the Vatican, where the emperor was lodged.</p>               <p>The German knights repulsed them with much slaughter, and this bloodshed proved
                    the beginning of an endless feud. Otto departed in February, and John XII., as
                    the chosen pope of the Romans, returned with an army of followers and compelled
                    the defenceless Leo VIII. to seek safety in flight. Soon afterwards Leo was
                    deposed and excommunicated by a new synod, and many of his adherents were
                    cruelly murdered. But on the 14th of May 964 John suddenly expired; the Romans,
                    amid violent struggles and tumults, resumed their rights, elected Benedict V.,
                    and procured his consecration in spite of the emperor’s veto. Otto now appeared
                    at the head of an army, committed fresh slaughter, besieged the city, reduced it
                    by famine, and, after holding a council which deposed Benedict and sent him a
                    prisoner to Hamburg, restored Leo VIII. to the papal throne.</p>               <p>But, although the emperor thus disposed of the papacy at his will, his arbitrary
                    exercise of power roused a long and obstinate resistance, which had no slight
                    effect upon the history of the commune. Leo VIII. died in 965, and the imperial
                    party elected John XIII. (965-72).</p>               <p>Upon this the nobles of the national party joined the people and there was a
                    general revolt. The nobles were led by Pietro, prefect of Rome. As we have
                    noted, this office seemed to be extinct during the Carolingian rule, but we
                    again meet with it in 955, after an interval of a century and a half. The
                    leaders of the people were twelve <hi rend="italic">decar coni,</hi> a term of
                    unknown derivation, but probably indicating chiefs of the twelve regions <hi
                        rend="italic">(dodecarcki, dodecarconi, decar coni}.</hi> The new pope was
                    seized and confined, first in the castle of St Angelo, then in a fortress in the
                    Campagna. But the emperor quickly marched an army against Rome, and this
                    sufficed to produce a reaction which recalled the pope (November 966), sent the
                    prefect into exile, and put several of the rebellious nobles to death. And
                    shortly after the emperor sacked the city. Many Romans were exiled, some
                    tortured, others, including the twelve <hi rend="italic">decar coni)</hi>
                    killed. John XIII. died in 972 and Otto in 973.</p>               <p>All these events clearly prove how great a change had now taken place in the
                    conditions of Rome. The people <hi rend="italic">(plebs)</hi> had made its
                    appearance upon the stage; the army had become democratic; the twelve regions
                    were regularly organized under leaders. Opposed to them stood the nobles, headed
                    by the prefect, also a noble, precisely as in Florence the nobles and the
                    podestà were later opposed to the gilds and the people. So far, it is true,
                    nobles and people had made common cause in Rome; but this harmony was soon to be
                    interrupted. The feudal spirit had made its way among the Roman aristocrats, had
                    split them into two parties and diminished their strength. It was now destined
                    to spread, and, as it was always vigorously detested and opposed by the people
                    elsewhere in Italy, so the same consequence was inevitable in Rome. Another
                    notable change, and a subject of unending controversy, had ako occurred in the
                    administration of justice. So far there were the <hi rend="italic">judices de
                        clero</hi> , also known as ordinary or palatine judges, and the <hi
                        rend="italic">judices de rnilitia^</hi> also ctyled <hi rend="italic"
                        >consules</hi> or <hi rend="italic">duces.</hi> These judges generally
                    formed a court of seven, three being <hi rend="italic">de clero,</hi> four <hi
                        rend="italic">de militia, qt</hi> vice versa, under the presidency of the
                    papal or imperial <hi rend="italic">missl.</hi> In criminal cases the <hi
                        rend="italic">judices de militia</hi> had the prefect or the imperial <hi
                        rend="italic">missus for</hi> their president. But there was a third order
                    of judges called <hi rend="italic">pedanei, a consulibus creati.</hi> It seems
                    clear that the <hi rend="italic">duces,</hi> being <hi rend="italic">distribuii
                        per judicat us,</hi> found themselves isolated in the provinces, and to
                    obtain assistance nominated these <hi rend="italic">pedand,</hi> who were legal
                    experts. In Rome, with its courts of law, they were less needed, but possibly in
                    those sections of the city where cases of minor importance were submitted to a
                    single magistrate reference was made to the <hi rend="italic">pedanei.</hi> But
                    many changes were made under the Franks, and when the edict of Lothair (824)
                    granted free choice of either the Roman or Germanic law, and the <hi
                        rend="italic">duces</hi> were replaced by <hi rend="italic">comites</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">gastaldiones,</hi> chiefly of German origin, the use of
                    legal experts became increasingly necessary. And the custom of employing them
                    was the more easily diffused by being already common among the Franks, whose <hi
                        rend="italic">scabini</hi> were legal experts acting as judges, though not
                    qualified to pass sentence. Thus the <hi rend="italic">pedanei</hi> multiplied,
                    came to resemble the <hi rend="italic">scabini,</hi> and were designated <hi
                        rend="italic">judices dativi (a magistratu dati}</hi> or simply <hi
                        rend="italic">dativi.</hi> These were to be found in the exarchate in 838,
                    but not in Rome until 961, when the <hi rend="italic">judices de miliiia</hi>
                    had ceased to exist. The great progress of the German legal procedure may then
                    have contributed to the formation of the new office.</p>               <p>Meanwhile Pope John XIII. had been succeeded by Benedict VI. (973-74) and Otto
                    I. by his son Otto II., a youth</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0668" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0715.jp2"/>
               <p>of eighteen married to the Byzantine princess Theophano. Thereupon the Romans,
                    who had supported the election of another pope, and were in no awe of the new
                    emperor, rose to arms under the command of Crescenzio, a rich and powerful
                    noble. They not only seized Benedict VI. by force, but strangled him in the
                    castle of St Angelo. The national and imperial parties then elected several
                    popes who were either exiled or persecuted, and one of them was said to be
                    murdered. In 985 John XV. was elected (985-96). During this turmoil, the
                    national party, composed of nobles and people, led by Giovanni Crescenzio, son
                    of the other Crescenzio mentioned above, had taken complete possession-of the
                    government. This Crescenzio assumed the title of patrician, and sought to
                    imitate Alberic, although far his inferior in capacity. Fortunately for him, the
                    reigning pope was a detested tyrant, and the emperor a child entirely guided by
                    his mother. But the new emperor Otto III. was backed by a powerful party, and on
                    coming to Rome in 996 was able, although only aged fifteen, to quell the
                    rebellion, oust Crescenzio from public life, and elect as successor to John XV.
                    his own cousin, Pope Gregory V. (996-99). But this first German pope surrounded
                    himself with compatriots, and by raising them to lofty posts even in the
                    tribunals excited a revolt that drove him from the throne (29th September 999).
                    Crescenzio, being master of the castle of St Angelo, resumed the title of
                    patrician or consul of the Romans, expelled the German judges, reconstituted the
                    government, prepared his troops for defence, and created a new pope. But the
                    following year Otto III. came to Rome, and his party opened the gates to him.
                    Although deserted by nearly all his adherents, Crescenzio held the castle
                    valiantly against its besiegers. At last, on the 29th of April</p>               <p>998, he was forced to make terms, and the imperialists, violating their pledges,
                    first put him to torture and then hurled him from the battlements. Gregory V.
                    dying shortly after these events, Sylvester II., another native of southern
                    France, who had been tutor to the emperor Otto III., was raised to the papacy
                    (999-1003).</p>               <p>Thus Otto III. was enabled to establish his mastery of Rome. But, as the son of
                    a Greek mother, trained amid Greek influences, his fantastic and contradictory
                    nature seemed only to grasp the void. He wished to reconstitute a
                    Romano-Byzantine empire with Rome for his capital. His discourse always turned
                    on the ancient republic, on consuls and senate, on the might and grandeur of the
                    Roman people; and his edicts were addressed to the senate and the people. The
                    senate is now constantly mentioned, and its heads bear the title of consuls. The
                    emperor also gave renewed honour to the title of patrician, surrounded himself
                    with officials bearing Greek and Roman designations, and raised the prestige of
                    the prefect, who, having now almost the functions of an imperial vicar, bore the
                    eagle and the sword as his insignia. Nevertheless Otto III. was thoroughly
                    German, and during his reign all Germanic institutions made progress in Rome.
                    This was particularly the case with feudalism, and Sylvester II. was the first
                    pope to treat it with favour. Many families of real feudal barons now arose. The
                    Crescenzii held sway in the Sabine hills, and Praeneste and Tusculum were great
                    centres of feudalism in the nth century. The system of feudal benefices was
                    recognized by the church, which made grants of lands, cities and provinces in
                    the feudal manner. The bishops, like feudal barons, became actual counts. And,
                    in consequence of these changes, when the emperor, as head of the feudal system,
                    seeks to impose his will upon the church (which has also become feudal) and
                    control the papal elections, he is met by the great question of the
                    investitures, a question destined to disturb the whole world. Meanwhile the
                    Roman barons were growing more and more powerful, and were neither submissive
                    nor faithful to the emperor. On the contrary, they resented his attitude as a
                    master of Rome, and, when he subjected Tivoli to the Holy See, attacked both him
                    and the pope with so much vigour as to put both to flight (16th February 1001).
                    Thereupon Rome again became a republic, headed by Gregory of</p>               <p>Tusculum, a man of a powerful family claiming descent from Alberic.</p>               <p>By the emperor’s death in January 1002 the race of the Ottos became extinct, the
                    papacy began to decline, as at the end of the Carolingian period, and the
                    nobles, divided into an imperial and a national party, were again predominant.
                    They reserved to themselves the office of patrician, and, electing popes from
                    their own ranks, obtained enlarged privileges and power. At the time when
                    Ardoin, marquis of Ivrea, profiting by the extinction of the Ottos and the
                    anarchy of Germany, was stirring Italy in the vain hope of constituting a
                    national kingdom, the Roman Republic was being consohdated under another
                    Giovanni Crescenzio, of the national faction. He was now elected patrician; one
                    of his kinsmen was invested with the office of prefect, and the new pope John
                    XVIII. (1003-9) <hi rend="sup">was</hi> one of his creatures. Although the power
                    of Henry oi Bavaria was then gaining ascendancy in Germany, and giving strength
                    to the imperialist nobles, Crescenzio still remained supreme ruler of the city
                    and the Campagna. Surrounded by his j’udges, the senators and his kinsman the
                    prefect, he continued to dispense j’ustice in his own palace until his death in
                    1012, after ten years’ rule. And, Pope Sergius IV. having died the same year,
                    the counts of Tusculum compassed the election of Benedict VIII. (1012-24), one
                    of their own kin. This pope expelled the Crescenzii, changed the prefect and
                    reserved the title of patrician for Henry II., whom he consecrated emperor .on
                    the 14th February 1014. A second Alberic, bearing the title of “ eminentissimus
                    consul et dux,” was now at the head of the republic and dispensed <hi
                        rend="italic">placita</hi> in the palace of his great ancestor, from whom
                    the counts of Tusculum were also descended.</p>               <p>The new emperor endeavoured to re-establish order in Rome, and strengthen his own
                    authority together with that of the pope. But the nobles had in all things the
                    upper hand. They were regularly organized under leaders, held meetings, asserted
                    their right to nominate both pope and emperor, and in fact often succeeded in so
                    doing. Even Henry II. himself was obliged to secure their votes before his
                    coronation. The terms senate and senator now recur still more frequently in
                    history. Nevertheless, Benedict VIII. succeeded in placing his own brother,
                    Romano, at the head of the republic with the title of “ consul, dux and senator,”
                    thus making him leader of the nobles, who met at his bidding, and chief of the
                    militia and the tribunals. The prefect still retained his authority, and the
                    emperor was by right supreme judge. But, a violent revolt breaking out, the
                    emperor only stayed to suppress it and then went to Germany in disgust. The
                    pope, aided by his brother, conducted the government with energy; he awed the
                    party of Crescenzio, and waged war against the Saracens in the south. But he
                    died in 1024, and in the same year Henry II. was succeeded by Conrad II. There
                    was now beheld a repetition of the same strange event that had followed the death
                    of Alberic, and with no less fatal consequences. Benedict’s brother Romano, head
                    of the republic, and stiU retaining office, was, although a layman, elected
                    pope. He took the name of John XIX. (1024-33), and in 1027 conferred the
                    imperial crown on Conrad the Salic, who, abolishing the Lothairian edict of 824,
                    decreed that throughout Rome and its territory justice should be henceforth
                    administered solely by the Justinian code. Thus, notwithstanding the spread of
                    feudalism and Germanic procedure, the Roman law triumphed through the
                    irresistible force of the national character, which was already manifested in
                    many other ways.</p>               <p>Meanwhile John XIX. was succeeded by his nephew, Benedict IX. (1033-4sX a lad of
                    twelve, who placed his own brother at the head of the republic. Thus church and
                    state assumed the aspect of hereditary possessions in the powerful house of the
                    counts of Tusculum. But the vices and excesses of Benedict were so monstrous
                    that the papacy sank to the lowest depth of corruption; there followed a series
                    of tumults</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0669" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0716.jp2"/>
               <p>and reactionary attempts, and so many conflicting elections that in 1045 three
                    popes were struggling for the tiara in the midst of scandal and anarchy. The
                    streets and neighbourhood of Rome swarmed with thieves and assassins; pilgrims
                    were plundered; citizens trembled for their lives; and a hundred petty barons
                    threatened the rival popes, who were obliged to defend themselves by force. This
                    state of things lasted until Henry III. came to re-establish order. He appointed
                    a synod to depose the three popes, and then, with the consent of the wearied and
                    anarchy-stricken Romans, assuming the right of election, proposed a German,
                    Clement II., who was consecrated at Christmas 1046. Henry III. was then crowned,
                    and also took the title of patrician. Thus the emperor was lord over church and
                    state. This, however, stirred both people and pope against him, and led to the
                    terrible contest of the investitures, although for the moment the Romans, being
                    exhausted by past calamities, seemed not only resigned but contented.</p>               <p>In fact, the idea of reform and independence was already germinating in the
                    church and was soon to become tenacious and irresistible. Hildebrand was the
                    prompter and hero of this idea. He sought to abolish the simony and concubinage
                    of the priesthood, to give the papal elections into the hands of the higher
                    ecclesiastics, and to emancipate the church from all dependence on the empire.
                    Henry III. procured the election of four German popes in succession, and
                    Hildebrand was always at hand to inspire their actions and dominate them by his
                    strength of intellect and still greater strength of will. But the fourth German
                    pope, Victor II,, died in 1057, and Henry III. had been succeeded in 1056 by the
                    young Henry IV. under the regency of a weak woman, the empress Agnes. Hildebrand
                    seized this favourable moment for trying his strength and procured the election
                    of Stephen IX. (1057-58), a candidate he had long had in view. Stephen, however,
                    died in 1058; the nobles instantly rose in rebellion; and Gregory of Tusculum,
                    who had assumed the patriciate, caused an incapable cousin to be named pope
                    (Benedict X.). Upon this Hildebrand postponed his design of maintaining the
                    papacy by the help of Italian potentates and had recourse to the empress. In a
                    synod held at Siena with her consent Benedict was deposed and Nicholas II.
                    (1059-61) elected in his stead. This pope entered Rome escorted by the troops of
                    Godfrey of Tuscany, and, when also assured of help from Naples, assembled a
                    council of one hundred and thirteen bishops (1059), who condemned the deposed
                    pontiff and renewed the prohibition of simony and concubinage among the
                    priesthood. Finally Nicholas instituted the college of cardinals, entrusting it
                    with the election of the pope, who was in future to be chosen from its ranks.
                    The assent of the clergy and people was left purely formal. The decree also
                    contained the proviso—“ saving the honour and reverence due to the emperor but
                    this too was</p>               <p>an empty expression.</p>               <p>The new decree was a master-stroke of Hildebrand’s genius, for by means of it he
                    placed the papal election in the hands of a genuine ecclesiastical senate and
                    gave a monarchical form to the church. Backed by the Normans who were in Rome,
                    and whose commander, Richard of Capua, did not scruple to strike off the heads
                    of many recalcitrant nobles, Hildebrand and the pope could now pursue their work
                    of reform. Nevertheless the nobles again revolted on the death of Nicholas II.
                    in 1061, and declared their purpose of restoring to Henry IV. the patriciate and
                    right of election; but Hildebrand, by speedily convoking the cardinals, procured
                    the election of Alexander II. (1061-73). This pope, although friendly to the
                    empire, did not await the imperial sanction, but, protected by the Romans, at
                    once entered the Lateran and put some other riotous nobles to death. The German
                    bishops, however, elected Honorius II., who had the support of the barons. Thus
                    the city was split into two camps and a deadly civil war ensued, terminating,
                    despite the vigorous resistance of the nobility, in the defeat of Honorius II.
                    But the nobles persevered in the contest and were the real masters of Rome. By
                    conferring the patriciate on the emperor, as their feudal chief, they hoped to
                    organize themselves under the prefect, who now, with greatly increased
                    authority, presided over both the civil and criminal courts in the absence of
                    the pope’s representative. In a general assembly the Romans elected their
                    prefect, whose investiture was granted by the emperor, while the pope elected
                    another. Thus disorder was brought to a climax.</p>               <p>Alexander died on the 21st April 1073, and thereupon Hildebrand was at last
                    raised to the chair as pope Gregory VII. (1073-85). He reconfirmed his
                    predecessors’ decrees, dismissed all simoniacal and non-celibate priests, and
                    then in a second council (1075) forbade the clergy to receive investiture at the
                    hands of laymen. No bishop nor abbot was again to accept ring or crozier from
                    king or emperor. Now, as ecclesiastical dignities included the possession of
                    extensive benefices, privileges and feudal rights, this decree gave rise to
                    tremendous dispute and to fierce contest between the empire and the church. The
                    nobles took a very decided part in the struggle. With Cenci, their former
                    prefect, at their head, they rose in revolt, assailed the pope on Christmas day
                    1075, and threw him into prison. But their fear of the popular wrath compelled
                    his speedy release; and he then decreed the excommunication and deposition of
                    the emperor who had declared him deposed. That monarch afterwards made
                    submission to Gregory at Canossa (1077), but, again turning against him, was
                    again excommunicated. And in 1081 he returned to Italy bringing the antipope
                    Clement III., and besieged Rome for forty days. Assembling the nobles in his
                    camp, he there arranged a new government of the city with prefect and senate,
                    palatine judges and other magistrates, exactly similar to the existing
                    government within the walls. He then took his departure, returned several times
                    in vain, but at last forced his way into the city (March 1084) and compelled
                    Gregory VII. to seek refuge in the castle of St Angelo. The emperor was then
                    master of Rome, established the government he had previously arranged and,
                    calling a parliament of nobles and bishops, procured the deposition of Gregory
                    and the consecration of Clement III., by whom he was crowned in 1084. He then
                    attacked and seized the Capitol, and assaulted the castle in order to capture
                    the pope. But Robert Guiscard brought his army to the rescue. Emperor and
                    antipope fled; the city was taken, the pope liberated ^and Rome reduced to ruin
                    by fire and pillage. Upon this Gregory VII., broken with grief, went away with
                    the Normans, and died at Salerno on the 25th May 1085. He had separated the
                    church from the people and the empire by a struggle that, as Gregoroxius says,
                    disturbed the deep sleep of the middle ages.</p>               <p>Pope Paschal II. (1099-1118) found himself entirely at the mercy of the
                    tyrannous nobles who were alike masters of Rome, of its government, and its
                    spiritual lord. As they were divided among themselves, all the pope could do was
                    to side with one party in order to overcome the other. With the help of his own
                    nephew Gualfredo, the prefect Pietro Pierleone, and the Frangipani, he was able
                    to keep down the Corsi, and hold the Colonna in check. Being compelled to repair
                    to Benevento in 1108, he left Gualfredo to command the militia, Tolomeo of
                    Tusculum to guard the Campagna, and the consuls Pierleone and Leone Frangipani,
                    together with the prefect, in charge of the government. The consulship was no
                    longer a mere title of honour. The consuls seem to have been elected, as at
                    Ravenna, in imitation of those of the Lombard cities, and were at the head of
                    the nobles and senate. The expressions “ praefectus et consulcs,” “ dc
                    sena-toribus et consulibus,” are now of frequent occurrence. Wc have no precise
                    knowledge of the political organization of the city at this moment; but it was
                    an aristocratic government, similar to that originally formed in Florence, as
                    Villani tells us, with a senate and consuls. The nobles were so completely the
                    masters that the pope, in spite of having trusted them</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0670" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0717.jp2"/>
               <p>with the government, could only return to Rome with the aid of the Normans.
                    Being now absorbed in the great investiture question, he had recourse to a
                    daring plan. He proposed to Henry V. that the bishops should resign all property
                    derived from the crown and depend solely on tithes and donations, while the
                    empire should resign the right of investiture. Henry seemed disposed to accept
                    the suggestion, but, suddenly changing his mind, took the pope prisoner and
                    forced him to yield the right of investiture and to give him the crown (mi). But
                    the following year the party of reform annulled in council this concession,
                    which the pope declared to have been extorted by force. By the death of Countess
                    Matilda in 1115 and the bequest of her vast possessions to the Holy See, the
                    pope’s dominions were greatly enlarged, but his authority as a ruler was nowise
                    increased. Deeds of violence still continued in Rome; and then followed the
                    death of the prefect Pietro. The nobles of the imperial party, joined with the
                    people, wished to elect Pietro’s son, also nephew to Tolomeo of Tusculum, who
                    then held the position of a potent imperial margrave, had territories stretching
                    from the Sabine mountains to the sea, was the dictator of Tusculum, master of
                    Latium and consul of the Romans. The pope opposed this election to the best of
                    his strength; but the nobles carried the day, and their new prefect received
                    investiture from the emperor. Upon this the pope again quitted Rome, and on his
                    return, two years later, was compelled to shut himself up in the castle of St
                    Angelo, where he died in 1118.</p>               <p>The popes were now the sport of the nobles whom they had aggrandized by
                    continual concessions for the sake of peace.</p>               <p>And peace seemed at hand when Innocent II. (1130-43), after triumphing over two
                    antipopes, came to terms with Roger I., recognized him as king of Sicily, and
                    gained his friendship and protection. But now still graver tumults took place.
                    In consequence of the division of the nobles neither party could overcome its
                    foes without the aid of the people, which thus became increasingly powerful.
                    Throughout upper and central Italy the cities were being organized as free and
                    independent communes on a democratic basis. Their example soon followed in the
                    ancient duchy of Rome and almost in the immediate neignbourhood of the city.
                    Even Tivoli was converted into a republic. This excited the deepest jealousy in
                    the Romans, arid they became furious when this little city, profiting by its
                    strong position in the Tever-one valley, not only sought to annex Roman
                    territory, but dared to offer successful resistance to the descendants of the
                    conquerors of the world. In 1141 Tivoli openly rebelled against the mother city,
                    and the pope sent the Romans to subdue it. They were not only repulsed, but
                    ignominiously pursued to their own gates. Afterwards, returning to the assault
                    in greater numbers, they conquered the hostile town. Its defenders surrendered
                    to the pope, and he immediately concluded a treaty of peace without consulting
                    either the people or the republic. The soldiery, still flushed with victory,
                    were furious at this slight. They demanded not only submission of Tivoli to the
                    Roman people, but also permission to demolish its walls and dwellings and expel
                    its population. Innocent II. refused consent to these excesses, and a memorable
                    revolution ensued by which the temporal power of the papacy was entirely
                    overthrown.</p>               <p>In 1143 the rebellious people rushed to the Capitol, proclaimed the republic,
                    reconstituted the senate, to the almost entire exclusion of the nobles, declared
                    the abolition of the temporal power, issued coin inscribed to the senate, the
                    people and St Peter, and began to reckon time from the day of the restoration of
                    liberty.' Arnold of Brescia was not, as has been incorrectly stated, the author
                    of this revolution, for he had not yet arrived in Rome. It was the outcome of an
                    historic necessity —above all, of the renewed vigour of the people and its
                    detestation of the feudal aristocracy. .This body, besides being divided into an
                    imperial and a national party, had almost excluded from the government the
                    powerful baronage of the Campagna</p>               <p>and the provinces. Also, as we have before noted, the Roman aristocracy was by
                    no means an exclusive caste. Between the great aristocrats and the people there
                    stood a middle or new nobility, which made common cause with the people, whose
                    chief strength now lay in the army. This, divided into twelve and then into
                    thirteen or fourteen regions, assembled under its banners all arm-bearing
                    citizens. Thus the <hi rend="italic">exercitus</hi> was also the real <hi
                        rend="italic">populus Romanns,</hi> now bent on the destruction of the
                    temporal power. This purpose, originating in the struggle of the investitures,
                    was the logical and inevitable result of thè proposals of Paschal II., which,
                    despite their rejection, found a loud echo in Italy. Lucius II. (1144-45) tried
                    to withstand the revolution by seeking Norman aid and throwing himself into the
                    arms of the feudal party, but this only precipitated the course of events. The
                    people, after having excluded nearly all aristocrats from the senate, now placed
                    at its head the noble Giordano dei Pierleoni, who had joined the revolutionary
                    party. They named him patrician, but without prejudice to the authority of the
                    empire, still held by them in respect, and also conferred on him the judicial
                    powers appertaining to the aristocratic and imperial office of prefect. The pope
                    was requested to resign the temporal power, the regalia and every other
                    possession, and content himself with the tithes and offerings of the faithful
                    according to the scheme of Paschal II. He indignantly refused, marched at the
                    head of the nobles against the Capitol, but was violently repulsed, and received
                    a blow on the head from a stone, which is supposed to have occasioned his speedy
                    death on the 15th February 1145. Eugenius III was then elected (1145-53), but
                    soon had to fly to Viterbo in quest of armed assistance, in consequence of the
                    senate’s resolve to prevent his consecration by force until he recognized the
                    new state of things in the Eternal City.</p>               <p>It was at this moment that Arnold of Brescia arrived in Rome. His ideas, already
                    well known in Italy, had inspired and promoted the Roman revolution, and he now
                    came to determine its method and direction. Born at Brescia in the beginning of
                    the 12th century, Arnold had studied in France under the celebrated Abelard, who
                    had instructed him in theology and philosophy, inspired him with a great love
                    for antiquity, and stimulated his natural independence of mind. On returning to
                    his native land he assumed the monkish habit, and proved the force and fervour
                    of his character by taking part in all struggles for liberty. And, together with
                    political reform, he preached his favourite doctrine of thè necessary
                    renunciation by the clergy of all temporal wealth. Expounded with singular
                    eloquence, these doctrines had a stirring effect on men’s minds, spread
                    throughout the cities of northern Italy, and were echoed on all sides. It seems
                    undoubted that they penetrated to Rome and helped to promòte the revolution, so
                    that Arnold was already present in spirit before he arrived there in person. It
                    is known that at the Lateran council of 1139 Innocent II. had declared these
                    doctrines to be inimical to the church and enjoined silence on their author.
                    And, as at that time the party hostile to liberty was triumphant in Brescia,
                    Arnold left his native place, crossed the Alps and returned to France, where
                    other struggles awaited him. He professed no anti-Catholic dogmas,—only
                    maintaining that when the pope and the prelacy deviated from the gospel rule of
                    poverty they should not be obeyed, but fearlessly opposed. In France, finding
                    his master, Abelard, exposed to the persecutions of St Bernard, he assumed his
                    defence with so much ardour that St Bernard directed the thunders of his
                    eloquence against the disciple as well as the master, saying of the former, “ He
                    neither eats nor drinks, suffers hunger, and, being leagued with the devil, only
                    thirsts for the blood of souls.” In 1142 we find Arnold a wanderer in
                    Switzerland, and then, suddenly reappearing in Italy, he arrived in Rome.</p>               <p>Three different elements entered into his nature and inspired his eloquence—an
                    exalted and mystic temperament, a great and candid admiration for classic
                    antiquity added to an equal admiration for republican freedom independent of the
                    church</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0671" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0718.jp2"/>
               <p>and the empire, and a profound conviction, derived from the Vaudois and Paterinc
                    doctrines, that the church could only be purified by the renunciation of
                    temporal wealth. Finding Rome already revolutionized in accordance with his own
                    ideas, he immediately began to preach there. His mystic exhortations against the
                    riches of the church had an inflammatory effect, while his classical
                    reminiscences aroused the enthusiasm of the Romans, and his suggestion that they
                    should imitate the republican institutions of upper Italy met the necessities of
                    the time that had created the revolution. He urged the reconstitution of the
                    ancient senate and senatorial order, which indeed was already partially
                    accomplished, and of the ancient equestrian order, and the reconstruction and
                    fortification of the Capitol. His proposed senate was a body somewhat resembling
                    the communal councils of upper Italy, his equestrian order a mounted force
                    composed of the lesser nobility, since at Rome, as elsewhere, the lower classes
                    had neither time nor means to form part of it. All his suggestions were
                    accepted; the citizens laboured strenuously on the fortification of the Capitol.
                    The pope soon beheld the revolution spread beyond the walls, and several cities
                    of the state proclaimed their independence. The barons of the Campagna profited
                    by the opportunity to act as independent sovereigns. Thus the whole domain of
                    the church was threatened with dissolution. The pope marched towards Rome with
                    his newly gathered army, but hoped to come to terms. The Romans in fact
                    recognized his authority, and he in his turn recognized the republic. The office
                    of patrician was abolished, and seems to have been replaced by that of
                    gonfalonier, and the prefect, answering to the podestà of the other republics,
                    was revived. The senators received investiture from the pope, who returned to
                    Rome at Christmas 1145- <hi rend="sup">!</hi> *</p>               <p>There public now seems to have been fully constituted. The senate was drawn from
                    the lower classes and the petty nobility, and this was the special
                    characteristic of the new revolution. In 1144 there were fifty-six senators,
                    probably four to each of the fourteen regions, but the number often varied. By
                    the few existing documents of the period we notice that the senators were
                    divided into <hi rend="italic">senator es consiliarii</hi> and ordinary
                    senators. The former constituted a smaller council, which, like the <hi
                        rend="italic">credenza</hi> or lesser council found in other cities,
                    consulted with the head or heads of the republic on the more urgent and secret
                    affairs of the state. And, conjointly with the rest of the senators, it formed
                    the greater council. Thus classic traditions were identified with new republican
                    usages, and the commonwealth of Rome resembled those in other parts of Italy.
                    But, of course, every republic had special local customs of its own. So the
                    Roman senate had judicial as well as political attributes, and there was a <hi
                        rend="italic">curia senatus</hi> composed of senators and legal experts.</p>               <p>As was easily to be foreseen, the agreement with the pope was of short duration.
                    The revolution could not be checked; the Romans desired independence, and their
                    spiritual lord fled to France, whence, in 1147, he proclaimed a new crusade,
                    while the Romans were employed in demolishing Tivoli, banishing its inhabitants,
                    and waging war on other cities. Giordano Pier-leone was gonfalonier and head of
                    the republic, and Arnold, supported by the popular favour and the enthusiasm of
                    the lower clergy,- was preaching with even greater fervour than before. But the
                    pope now re-entered Italy, proclaimed Arnold a schismatic, and then advancing to
                    Tusculum assembled an army in order to attack Rome. In this emergency the Romans
                    applied to Conrad III., the first emperor of the house of Hohcn-staufen; and
                    their urgent letters are clearly expressive of Arnold's theories and his medley
                    on ancient and modern, sacred and profane, ideas. “ Rome,” so they said, “ is
                    the fountain of the empire confided to you by the Almighty, and we seek to
                    restore to Rome the power possessed by her under Constantine and Justinian. For
                    this end we conquered and destroyed the strongholds of the barons who, together
                    with the pope and the Normans, sought to resist us. These are now attacking us
                    on all sides. Haste to Rome, the capital of the world, thus to establish thy
                    imperial sway over the Italian and German lands.”</p>               <p>After long hesitation the king of the Romans at last replied to these appeals,
                    stating that he would come “ to re-establish order, reward the faithful, and
                    punish the rebellious.” These words promised ill. In fact Conrad had already
                    arranged terms with the pope; but his fife came to an end on the 15th of
                    February 1152.</p>               <p>He was succeeded by Frederick I. surnamed Barbarossa, who took no notice of the
                    numerous letters urging him to come and receive the empire from the Roman
                    people, which alone had the right of conferring it. In accordance with his
                    design of subduing all the independent cities, he made an agreement with the
                    pope, in which he vowed to give no truce to the Romans, but subject them to
                    their spiritual lord, whose temporal power should be restored. The pope, on his
                    side, promised to crown him emperor. Thereupon the people again rose to arms,
                    and Arnold broke off all negotiations with Eugenius III. The senate was
                    reorganized, formed of one hundred members, and, according to the old Roman
                    precedent, had two consuls, one for internal and the other for external affairs.
                    Frederick was a daring statesman, a valiant soldier in command of a powerful
                    army, and was no friend of half measures. Accordingly the nobles ventured on
                    reaction. Finally, to increase the gravity of the situation, an English
                    jx&gt;pe, Adrian IV., was elected (1154-59), who was also a man of strong
                    and resolute temper. In fact, even before being able to take possession of the
                    Lateran, he requested the Romans to banish Arnold, who, with greater eloquence
                    than ever, was directing his thunders against the papacy. These utterances
                    increased the wrath of Adrian, who, encouraged by the knowledge that Frederick
                    and his host were already in Italy, at last launched an interdict against Rome.
                    It was the first time that a pope had ventured to curse the Eternal City. The
                    interdict put a summary stop to the religious life of the inhabitants. Men's
                    minds were seized with a sudden terror, and a fierce tumult broke out. Thereupon
                    the senators, whose opposition to the pope was less courageous than that of the
                    fallen magnates, prostrated themselves at his feet and implored pardon. But
                    Adrian demanded the expulsion of Arnold before consenting to raise the
                    interdict. Arnold was therefore obliged to leave Rome. After having for nine
                    years preached successfully in favour of liberty, after having been the moving
                    spirit of the new revolution, the new constitution, he was now abandoned by all,
                    and forced to wander from castle to castle, in the hope of reaching some
                    independent city capable of shielding him from the fierce enmity of the pope.
                    Meanwhile Frederick I. had achieved his first victories in Lop-bardy, and,
                    leaving ruined cities and bloodshed in his track, was rapidly advancing towards
                    central Italy. The pope sent three cardinals to him, with a request for the
                    capture and consignment of Arnold, who had taken refuge in the castle of the
                    Visconti of Gampagnatico. Frederick without delay caused one of the Visconti to
                    be seized and kept prisoner until Arnold was given up, and then consigned the
                    latter to the papal legates. The pope in his turn gave the reformer into the
                    hands of the prefect, Pietro di Vico, who immediately hanged his prisoner, burnt
                    his body at the stake and cast his ashes into the Tiber. The execution took
                    place in June 1155. The exact date and place of it are unknown; we only know
                    that Arnold met his fate with great serenity and firmness.</p>               <p>But the Romans who had so basely deserted their champion would not give up their
                    republic. Their envoys went to meet Frederick near Sutri, and made an address in
                    the usual fantastic style on the privileges of the Roman people and its sole
                    right to confer the imperial crown. But Frederick indignantly cut short their
                    harangue, and they had to depart full of rage. He then continued his march, and,
                    entering Rome on the 18th of June 1155, was forthwith crowned in St Peter’s by
                    the pope. Thereupon the Romans rushed to arms, and made a furious attack on the
                    Leonine city and the imperial camp. A desperate battle went on throughout the
                    day; and the knights proved that the equestrian order instituted at Arnold's
                    suggestion was no empty</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0672" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0719.jp2"/>
               <p>sham. About a thousand Romans perished by the sword or by drowning, but their
                    fellow-citizens made such determined preparations to continue the struggle that
                    Frederick, on the 19th of June, hastily retreated, or rather fled, and was
                    escorted as far as Tivoli by the pope and the cardinals. After all, the temporal
                    power of the papacy was not restored, and the republic still survived in the
                    form bestowed on it by Arnold of Brescia. Its existence was in truth favourable
                    rather than injurious to Frederick, whose aim was to rule over Rome and treat
                    the bishops as his vassals. He had not yet discerned that his best policy would
                    have been to use the republic as a lever against the pope. The latter, with
                    keener acumen, while remaining faithful to the feudal party in Rome, made
                    alliance with the communes of Lombardy and encouraged them in their resistance
                    to the emperor. Adrian IV. died in 1159, and the national party elected
                    Alexander III. (1159-81), who energetically opposed the pretensions of
                    Frederick, but, having to struggle with three antipopes successively raised
                    against him by the imperial party, was repeatedly driven into exile. During
                    these schisms the senate quietly carried on the government, administered
                    justice, and made war on some neighbouring cities and barons. An army comprising
                    many nobles of the national party marched against Tusculum, but found it
                    defended by several valiant officers and a strong band of German soldiery, who,
                    on the 29th of May 1167, inflicted on the Romans so severe a defeat that it is
                    styled’by Gregorovius the Cannae of the middle ages. Shortly afterwards the
                    emperor arrived in Rome with his antipope Paschal III., and Alexander had to fly
                    before him to Benevento. Then, at last, Frederick came to terms with the
                    republic, recognized the senate, which accepted investiture at his hands,
                    re-established the prefecture as an imperial office, and bestowed it on
                    Giovanni, son of Pietro di Vico. He then hastily departed, without having
                    advanced outside the Leonine city.</p>               <p>Meanwhile Pope Alexander continued the crafty policy of Adrian and with better
                    success, for the Lombard cities had now formed a league and inflicted a signal
                    defeat on the emperor at Legnano on the 29th of May 1176. One of the results of
                    this battle was the conclusion of an agreement between the pope and the emperor,
                    the latter resigning his pretensions on Rome and yielding all that he had denied
                    to Adrian. And by the treaty of Venice (1st of August 1177) the antipope was
                    forsaken, Alexander III. recognized and hailed as the legitimate pontiff, and
                    the prefect of Rome again nominated by the pope, to whom the emperor restored
                    the temporal power, acknowledging him the independent sovereign of Rome and of
                    the ecclesiastical state, from Acquapendente to Ceprano. Frederick’s troops
                    accompanied the pope to Rome, where the republic was forced to make submission
                    to him. But, proudly conscious as it still was of its strength, its surrender
                    wore the aspect of a voluntary concession, and its terms began with these words:
                    “ Totius populi Romani consilio et deliberatione statu turn est,” &amp;c.
                    The senators, elected yearly in September, had to swear fealty to the pope, and
                    a certain proportion of nobles was included in their number. On his return to
                    Rome, Alexander received a solemn welcome from all, but be had neither
                    extinguished nor really subdued the republic. On the contrary, men’s minds were
                    more and more inflamed by the example of freedom displayed in the north of
                    Italy. He died on the 30th of August 1181. The fact that between 1181 and 1187
                    there were three popes always living in exile proves that the republic was by no
                    means crushed. During the same period another blow was inflicted on- the papacy
                    by the marriage of Henry VI., son and successor to Frederick I., with Constance,
                    sole heiress of the Norman line in Naples. For thus the kingdom was joined to
                    the empire, and the popes were more than ever in the latter’s power. On the 20th
                    of December 1187 Clement III. (1187-91), being raised to the pontificate, made a
                    solemn agreement with the government of the Capitol before coming to Rome. And
                    this peace or <hi rend="italic">concordia</hi> had the air of a treaty between
                    potentates of equal importance. Rome confronted</p>               <p>the pope from the same standpoint from which the Lombard cities had confronted
                    the emperor after Legnano. This treaty, the basis of the new constitution, was
                    confirmed on the last day of May 1188 (Anno XLIV. of the senate). It begins with
                    these words: “ Concordia inter Dominum Papam Clementem III. et senatores
                    populumque Romanum super rcgalibus et aliis dignitatibus urbis.” The pope was
                    recognized as supreme lord, and invested the senators with their dignity. He
                    resumed the privilege of coinage, but allowed one-third of the issue to be made
                    by the senate. Almost all the old pontifical rights and prerogatives were
                    restored to him. The pope might employ the Roman militia for the defence of his
                    patrimony, but was to furnish its pay. The rights of the church over Tivoli and
                    Tusculum were confirmed; but the republic reserved to itself the right of making
                    war on those cities, and declared its resolve to dismantle and destroy the walls
                    and castle of Tusculum. In this undertaking the pope was to co-operate with the
                    Romans, even should the unhappy city make surrender to him alone.</p>               <p>From all this it is clear that the church had been made independent of the
                    empire, and that the republic, despite its numerous concessions, was by no means
                    subject to the church.</p>               <p>The pope, in fact, had obtained liberty of election, and Frederick I., by
                    resigning the investiture of the prefect, had virtually renounced his claim to
                    imperial power in Rome. The republic had no patrician nor any other imperial
                    magistrate, and preserved its independence even as regarded the pope, who merely
                    granted investiture to magistrates freely chosen by the people, and had no
                    legislative nor administrative power in the city. His temporal dominion was
                    limited to his great possessions, to his regalia, to a supreme authority that
                    was very indefinite, and to a feudal authority over the barons of the Campagna
                    and many cities of a state that seemed ever on the point of dissolution. The
                    senate continued to frame laws, to govern, and to administer justice. The army
                    carried on the wars of the republic, as we see by the tragic fate of Tusculum,
                    which was razed to the ground on the 19th of April 1191. Thus the powerful
                    counts of Tusculum disappeared; they sought refuge in the Campagna, and
                    according to all probability the no less potent family of the Colonna sprang
                    from their line. In consequence of these events, the nobles realized that the
                    papacy sought to reduce them to vassalage. And, seeing that the republic
                    remained firmly established and able to help them, they began to adhere to it
                    and succeeded in obtaining admission to the new senate. In fact, whereas since
                    1143 plebeians and petty nobles had prevailed in its ranks, nobles of ancient
                    descent are now found outnumbering the knights and burghers. But in 1191 this
                    state of things caused a sudden popular outbreak which abolished the
                    aristocratic senate and gave the headship of the republic to a single senator,
                        <hi rend="italic">summits senator</hi> , named Benedetto “ Carissi-mus ” or
                    “ Cams Homo ” or “ Carosomo,” of unknown, but undoubtedly plebeian, origin.
                    During the two years he remained in office this personage stripped the pope of
                    his revenues, despatched <hi rend="italic">justitiarti</hi> even to the
                    provinces, and with the aid of the parliament and other popular assemblies
                    promulgated laws and statutes. But he was overthrown by a counter-revolution,
                    and Giovanni Capoccio of the party of the nobles became senator for two years,
                    and had been succeeded by one of the Pierleoni when, in 1197, a fresh revolution
                    re-established a senate of fifty-six members, chiefly consisting of feudal
                    barons in high favour with Henry VI., who had revived the imperial faction in
                    Rome. But this emperor’s life ended the same year as the pope’s, in 1198, and
                    the new pontiff, Innocent III. (1198-1216), began to make war on the nobles, who
                    were again masters of the republic. Their leader was the prefect Pietro di Vico.
                    Owing to the revolution of 1143, most of the prefectorial attributes were now
                    vested in the senate; nevertheless, Pietro still retained a tribunal of police
                    both within and without the</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0673" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0720.jp2"/>
               <p>-city. But his main strength was derived from the vast possessions of the Vico
                    family, in which the office of prefect now became hereditary. Very soon,
                    however, these prefects of Vico were chiefly regarded as the great feudal lords
                    of Tuscia, and the independent municipal office lost its true character. Then
                    the popes made a point of according great pomp and dignity to this nominal
                    prefect, in order to overshadow the senator, who still represented the
                    indépendence of the republic and had assumed</p>               <p>many of the attributes wrested from the prefect.</p>               <p>But Innocent III., dissatisfied with this state of things, contrived by bribing
                    the people to arrogate to himself the right of electing the senator, who had now
                    to swear fealty and submission to the pope, and also that of nominating the
                    provincial <hi rend="italic">justitiarii,</hi> formerly chosen by the government
                    of the Capitol. This was a deadly blow to the republic, for the principal rights
                    of the people— <hi rend="italic">-i.e.</hi> the election of pope and emperor,
                    prefect and senate—were now lost. The general discontent provoked fresh
                    revolutions, and Innocent III. employed all his political dexterity to ward off
                    their effects. But shortly afterwards the people made a loud outcry for a senate
                    of fifty-six members; and the pope, again making a virtue of necessity, caused
                    that number to be chosen by twelve <hi rend="italic">tnediani</hi> specially
                    named by him for the</p>               <p>purpose. Even this did not calm the popular discontent, <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    which was also stirred by other disputes. The consequence was that when, six
                    months later, the pope again elected a single senator the Romans rose to arms,
                    and in 1204 formed a government of <hi rend="italic">Buoni Uomini</hi> in
                    opposition to that created by the pope. But an amicable arrangement being
                    concluded, the pope once more nominated fifty-six senators; and when, soon
                    after, he again reduced them to one, the people were too weary to resist (1205).
                    Thus the Capitol was subdued, and Innocent III. spent his last years in
                    tranquillity.</p>               <p>On the 22nd of November 1220 Honorius III. (1216-27) conferred the imperial
                    crown on Frederick II., who confirmed to the church the possession of her former
                    states, of those bequeathed to her by Countess Matilda, and even of the March of
                    Ancona. But it was soon seen that he sought to dominate all Italy, and was
                    therefore a foe to be dreaded. The successor of Honorius, Pope Gregory IX.
                    (1227-41), was speedily insulted and put to flight by the Ghibelline nobles,
                    whose courage had revived, and the republic began to subdue the Latían cities on
                    its own account. Peace was several times made and unmade by pope and people; but
                    no enduring harmony was possible between them, since the former wished to
                    subject the entire state to the church, and the latter to escape from the rule
                    of the church and hold sway over “ the universal land from Ceprano to Radicofani
                    ” formerly belonging to the duchy. Accordingly, the Roman people now appointed
                    judges, imposed taxes, issued coin, and made the clergy amenable to secular
                    tribunals. In 1234 the senator Luca Savelli published an edict declaring Tuscia
                    and Campania territories of the republic, and sent judges thither to exact an
                    oath of obedience. He also despatched the militia to the coast, where it
                    occupied several cities and erected fortresses; and columns were raised
                    everywhere inscribed with the initials S. P. Q. R. The pope, unable to prevent
                    but equally unable to tolerate these acts, fled from Rome, hurling his anathema
                    against Savelli, “ et omnes illos consiliarios urbis quorum consilio,”
                    &amp;c. The Romans sacked the Lateran and the houses of many cardinals, and
                    marched on Viterbo, but were driven back by the papal troops. When Savelli left
                    office and Angelo Malabranca was elected in his stead, the people made peace and
                    submission in 1235, and were obliged to give up their pretensions of subjecting
                    the clergy to ordinary tribunals and the urban territory to the republic. Thus
                    matters were virtually settled on the footing established by Innocent III.,
                    thanks to the aid given to the pope by Frederick II., who</p>               <p>had been one of the promoters of the rebellion.</p>               <p>It may appear strange that, at this period of their history, the Romans, after
                    showing such tenacious adherence to the republic and senate, should have
                    accepted the rule of a single senator without rushing to arms, and passed and
                    repassed from one form of government to another with such surprising
                    indifference. But on closer examination it is plain that these changes were
                    greater in appearance than reality. We have already seen, in treating of
                    Carosomo, how the single senator convoked the people in parliament to pass
                    sanction on the laws. But, whenever there is only one senator, we also
                    continually meet with the expression “ consilium vel consilia urbis.” It is
                    evident that when, instead of laws to be approved in parliament by a simple
                    placet or rejected by a non-placet, matters requiring consideration had to be
                    discussed, the senator convoked a much smaller council, consisting only of the
                    leaders of the people. These leaders were the heads of the twelve or thirteen
                    regions of the guilds, now becoming organized and soon to be also thirteen in
                    number, and of the militia. As in the other Italian republics, all these
                    associations had been formed in Rome.</p>               <p>The senator therefore held consultation with the leading men of the city; and,
                    although, especially at first, these meetings were rather loosely organized, it
                    is clear that they took the form of two councils—one numerous <hi rend="italic"
                        >(consiglio maggiore),</hi> the other limited <hi rend="italic">(consiglio
                        tninore</hi> or <hi rend="italic">speciale),</hi> co-operating with and
                    forming part of the first. Such was the prevailing custom throughout Italy at
                    the time when Roman institutions most nearly resembled those of the other
                    republics. We already know that, from the date of Arnold’s reforms, the senate,
                    with its junta of counsellors, had been divided into two parts, forming when
                    united a species of greater council. Therefore the transition from a senate
                    divided into two parts to the greater and lesser councils must have been very
                    easy and natural. And, seeing that later, when the nomination of a single
                    senator had become a constant practice, the meetings of the two councils are
                    frequently mentioned without the slightest remark or hint as to their origin, it
                    is clear that they had been gradually formed and long established. Not long
                    after the revolution of 1143 the grandees sought to re-enter the senate; and the
                    popes themselves, partly from dread of the people and partly to aggrandize their
                    own kindred, contributed to build up the power of a new and no less turbulent
                    nobility. This class, arising between the 12th and 13th centuries, was composed
                    of families newly created by the popes, together with remnants of the old
                    aristocracy, such as the Frangipani, Colonna, &amp;c. These nobles,
                    regaining possession of the senate, so completely eliminated the popular element
                    that, when the popes again opposed them, and, obtaining from the parliament the
                    right of electing the senators, adopted the expedient of appointing one only,
                    the senator was always chosen from the ranks of the nobles. And then the people,
                    unable and unwilling to renounce republican forms, replaced their suppressed
                    senate by a greater and a lesser council. This was an easy task—a natural
                    consequence of the fact that the people now began to constitute the real
                    strength of the republic. Later, with an increasing detestation for their
                    nobility, the Romans decreed that the single senator should be of foreign birth,
                    and, as we shall see, chose Brancaleone in the middle of the 13th century.</p>               <p>Thus, after a long series of frequent changes and revolutions, the Roman
                    republic became a commonwealth, with an increasing resemblance to those of the
                    other Italian cities. The people were organized and armed, the gilds almost
                    established, the two councils gradually constituted, and the aristocracy, while
                    retaining special local characteristics, assumed its definitive shape. It is not
                    surprising to find that Rome, like other Italian cities, now possessed statutes
                    of its own. There has been much controversy on this point. Certain writers had
                    alluded to a statute of 1246. As no one, however, could discover any statute of
                    that date, others decided that it had never existed. A statute of 1363</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0674" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0721.jp2"/>
               <p>was recently published by Professor Camillo Re, who asserted it to be the first
                    and most ancient that Rome had possessed. But the still more recent researches
                    of Messrs La Mantia and Levi prove that Professor Re’s assertions were somewhat
                    too bold. There is certain evidence of a <hi rend="italic">statutum senatus</hi>
                    existing between 1212 and 1227, of a <hi rend="italic">statutum vel capitulare
                        senatoris vel senatus</hi> of 1235, followed in 1241 by a <hi rend="italic"
                        >statutum urbis.</hi> This brings us very near to the statute of 1246
                    mentioned by Vitale and others. So it is well ascertained that, in the first
                    half of the 13th century, Rome possessed statutes at large composed of older
                    limited statutes. The consuls of the trade gilds were from 1267 regular members
                    of the councils; and the merchants’ gild held general meetings in 1255. Its
                    statutes were confirmed in 1296 by the senator Pandolfo Savelli, and the
                    compilation of these, published in 1880 by Signor Gatti, refers to 1317-</p>               <p>Meanwhile the struggle between Frederick II. and the pope was once more renewed.
                    The former sought to dominate Italy, separate the state from the church, and
                    repress the republics. The latter, although really hostile to the Roman free
                    government, joined it against the emperor, who on his side favoured the republic
                    of</p>               <p>Rome and the nobles most adverse to the pope. Thus the new nobility, composed,
                    as we have seen, of two different elements, was again split into a Guelph party
                    headed by the Orsini and a Ghibelline party under the Colonna. And in 1238 it
                    was deemed advisable to elect two senators instead of one, in the hope of
                    conciliating both factions by simultaneously raising them to power. Afterwards
                    one only was elected, alternately an Orsini and a Colonna, then again two, and
                    so on. But all these changes failed in their aims, since the struggle between
                    emperor and pope exasperated party feeling in Rome. Frederick was king of
                    southern Italy and emperor; had he been able to enforce the whole of his
                    authority he would have been absolute master of all Italy, a state of things
                    which the popes could not in any way tolerate. Hence the obstinate and
                    uninterrupted struggle which proved injurious both to the papacy and the empire.
                    The political genius of Frederick might have wrought great harm to the city had
                    not his mind teemed with contradictory ideas. Although desirous to emancipate
                    the state from the church, he was opposed to the communal democracy, which was
                    then the chief strength of the secular state in Italy. While combating the
                    church and persecuting her defenders, he yet sent heretics to the stake;
                    although excommunicated, he undertook a crusade; he feasted at his table
                    philosophers, sceptic and atheist poets, bishops and Mussulmans; he proclaimed
                    anti-Christian the possession of wealth by the church, yet made lavish gifts to
                    altar and monastery. Thus, although he had a strong party in Rome, it seemed to
                    dissolve at his approach, inasmuch as all feared that he might abolish the
                    statutes and liberties of the commune. In fact, when he advanced towards Rome on
                    the death of Gregory IX. in 1241 he was energetically repulsed by the people,
                    and later even by Viterbo, a city that had always been faithful to him. But
                    after he had withdrawn, his adherents gained strength and put to flight his
                    opponent, Innocent IV. (1243-54), the newly elected pope, who then from his
                    asylum at Lyons hurled an excommunication against him. Frederick’s death in
                    December 1250 determined the fall of the Ghibelline party and the close of the
                    imperial epoch in Italy. The pope instantly returned to Rome with the set
                    purpose of destroying the power of the Hohenstaufens. This was no longer
                    difficult when, by the decease of Conrad IV. (1254), the child Conradin became
                    the last legitimate representative of that line, and negotiations were already
                    on foot for placing the Angevins on the Neapolitan throne.</p>               <p>The republic meanwhile preserved its independence against the pope, who, among
                    other concessions, had entirely given up to it the right of coinage.
                    Nevertheless, being much harassed by the factiousness of the nobility, it was
                    obliged in X252 to decide on the election of an alien senator armed wdth ample
                    powers, precisely as other communes gave the government into the hands of a
                    podestà. Accordingly a Bolognese noble, Brancaleone degli Andalò, count of
                    Casalecchio, and a Ghibelline of much energy and talent, was invited to Rome.
                    But before accepting office he insisted on making definite terms. He desired to
                    hold the government for three years; and this, although contrary to the
                    statutes, was granted. Further, to ensure his personal safety, he demanded that
                    many scions of the noblest Roman houses should be sent as hostages to Bologna;
                    and to this also the republic consented. Then, in August 1252, he came with his
                    judges and notaries, made oath to observe justice and the laws, and began to
                    govern. He was head of the republic in peace and in war, supreme judge and
                    captain in chief. He nominated the podestàs of subject territories, despatched
                    ambassadors, issued coin, concluded treaties and received oaths of obedience.
                    The pope, who was then at Perugia, was greatly afflicted by the arrival of this
                    new master, but, despairing of aid from any quarter, was forced to make a virtue
                    of necessity. Thus Brancaleone was able to seize the reins of power with a firm
                    grasp. The parliament still met in the square of the Capitol, and the greater
                    and lesser councils in the church of Ara Coeli. There were besides frequent
                    assemblies of the college of Capitoline judges or <hi rend="italic"
                        >assectamentum.</hi> Unfortunately, no records having been preserved of the
                    proceedings of the Roman councils and parliament, little can be said of the
                    manner in which affairs were conducted. Certainly Brancaleone’s government was
                    not very parliamentary. He convoked the councils as seldom as was possible,
                    although he frequently assembled the people in parliament. The chief complaint
                    made against him was of undue severity in the administration of justice. He
                    rendered the clergy amenable to secular tribunals, subdued the neighbouring
                    cities of Tivoli, Palestrina, &amp;c., and commanded in person the attacking
                    force. But his greatest energy was directed to the repression of the more
                    turbulent nobles who were opposed to him; and he soon made them feel the weight
                    of his hand by hanging some, banishing others, and persecuting several more. But
                    he too recognized the expediency of winning the popular favour. He was the first
                    senator to add to his title that of captain of the people (“ Almae Urbis Senator
                    111: et Romani Populi Capitaneus ”). He befriended the people by promoting the
                    organization of gilds after the manner of those of his native Bologna. There
                    were already a few in Rome, such as the merchants’ gild and that of the
                    agriculturists, <hi rend="italic">Bobacteriorum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">B
                        ovattar i,</hi> who must have resembled the so-called <hi rend="italic"
                        >mercanti di campagna</hi> or graziers of the present day, since no peasant
                    gild existed in Italian republics. The merchants’ gild, definitely established
                    in 1255 under Brancaleone’s rule, had four consuls and twelve councillors, held
                    meetings and made laws. The other gilds, thirteen in all, were organized much on
                    the same plan. The admission of their heads into the councils of the republic in
                    1267 shows how efficaciously their interests had been promoted by Brancaleone.</p>               <p>The death of Innocent IV. and the election of Alexander IV. (1254-61), who was
                    milder and less shrewd than his predecessor, were favourable events for
                    Brancaleone; but he failed to check the growing discontent of the clergy and the
                    more powerful nobles, who had received deadly injuries at his hands. And when,
                    on the expiration of his three years’ term of office, his re-election was
                    proposed, his enemies rose against him, accused him before the <hi rend="italic"
                        >sindacato,</hi> threw him into prison, and vehemently protested against the
                    continuance of <hi rend="sup">a</hi> foreign tyranny.” His life was only spared
                    on account of the hostages sent to Bologna. The next senator chosen was a
                    Brescian Guelph, Emanuele de Madio, a tool of the nobles, who were now masters
                    of the situation. But soon afterwards, in 1257, the gilds rose in revolt, drove
                    the nobles from power, put the pope to flight, and recalled Brancaleone for
                    another three years’ term. He ruled more sternly than before, hung several
                    nobles, and made alliance with Manfred, the representative of the Swabian party
                    in Italy. This rendered him increasingly odious to the pope and procured his
                    excommunication. But, disregarding the</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0675" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0722.jp2"/>
               <p>thunders of the church, he marched against Anagni, the pope's birthplace, and
                    Alexander was quickly obliged to humiliate himself before the senator of Rome.
                    Brancaleone next set to work to destroy the fortified towers of the nobility,
                    and in razing them to the ground ruined many of the adjacent dwellings.
                    Accordingly, a considerable number of nobles became homeless exiles. In 1258,
                    while engaged on the siege of Corneto, Brancaleone was attacked by a violent
                    fever, and, being carried back to Rome, died on the Capitoline Hill. Thus ended
                    the career of a truly remarkable statesman. He was succeeded by his uncle,
                    Castellano degli Andalô, who, lacking the political genius of his nephew, only
                    retained office until the following spring (1259), in the midst of fierce and
                    perpetual disturbances. Then the people, being bribed by the pope, joined with
                    the nobles and drove him away. His life too was saved by having followed his
                    nephew’s shrewd plan of sending hostages to Bologna. Two senators of Roman birth
                    were next elected; and on the death of Alexander IV.a French pope was chosen,
                    UrbanIV. (1261-64), thus giving fresh predominance in the church to the
                    anti-Swabian policy. But the internal disturbances of the city soon ■drove Urban
                    to flight.</p>               <p>At this period the fall of the empire had induced many Italian republics to seek
                    strength by placing their governments in the hands of some prince willing to
                    swear respect to their laws and to undertake their defence against neighbouring
                    states and the pope. In Rome the Guelphs and Ghibellines proposed various
                    ■candidates for this office, and after many fierce quarrels ended by electing a
                    committee of <hi rend="italic">boni homines,</hi> charged with the revision ■of
                    the statutes, reorganization of the city, and choice of a senator. This
                    committee sat for more than a year without nominating any one, so, the Guelph
                    party being now predominant, and all being wearied of this provisional state of
                    things, the majority agreed on the election as senator of Charles of Anjou, who,
                    at the pope’s summons, was already preparing for the conquest of Naples. The
                    Romans thought that he would defend Rome against the pope, and the pope would
                    defend Rome against him; and by thus taking advantage of either’s jealousy the
                    citizens hoped to keep their republic intact. In fact, although Urban IV. had
                    incited Charles to attack Naples, he was by no means willing to see him
                    established as master in Rome. He accordingly declared that, if Charles really
                    wished to obtain the Neapolitan crown, he must only accept the offered dignity
                    pending the conquest of that kingdom. And he must likewise promise to recognize
                    the supremacy of the pope over the senate. Charles soothed him with the amplest
                    verbal promises, but in fact accepted the senatorship for life. In 1265, when
                    Urban was succeeded by Clement IV. (1265-68), who as a Provençal was a subject
                    of Charles, the latter entered Rome and was immediately made senator. Seven days
                    later (28th of June) he received the investiture of the Neapolitan kingdom, and
                    in the following January its crown. On the 26th of February 1266 the battle of
                    Benevento was fought, and, the valiant Manfred being killed, the triumph of the
                    Guelph Angevins in Italy was assured. Then, at the urgent command of the pope,
                    Charles was forced to resign the senatorship in the May of the same year. Two
                    Romans were elected in his stead, but soon fell out with the pope, because the
                    Guelph nobles again tried to exercise tyranny. The people, however, profited by
                    these disturbances to rise on its own account, and formed a democratic
                    government of twenty-six <hi rend="italic">boni homines</hi> with Angelo
                    Capocci, a Ghibelline, as its captain. By this government Don Henry, son of
                    Ferdinand III. of Castile, was elected senator; and he came to Rome for the
                    purpose of promoting a Ghibelline and Swabian policy in favour of</p>               <p>Conradin, who was preparing for conflict. The rule of the new senator was very
                    energetic, for he kept down the clergy, subdued the Campagna, persecuted the
                    Guelph nobles, made alliance with the Tuscan Ghibellines, forcibly drove back
                    the troops of King Charles, who was advancing towards Rome, and gave a splendid
                    reception to Conradin. But the battle of Tagliacozzo (23rd of August 1268),
                    followed by the murder of Conradin, proved fatal to the Ghibelline party.
                    Charles was re-elected senator immediately after the battle, and the pope
                    confirmed his powers for a term of ten years, after having already named him
                    imperial vicar in Tuscany. On the 16th of September Charles for the second time
                    took possession of the Capitol, and ruled Rome firmly by means of vice-governors
                    or vicars.</p>               <p>The Swabian line was now extinct, and in Charles’s hands the Neapolitan kingdom
                    had become a fief of the church. The empire had fallen so low as to be no longer
                    formidable. Now therefore was the moment for treating with it in order to
                    restrain Charles, and also for making use of the French king to keep the empire
                    in check. And this was the j&gt;oiicy of Nicholas III. (1277-80), who
                    hastened to extract advantageous promises from Rudolph of Habsburg, the new
                    candidate for the imperial crown. In 1278, the ten years’ term having expired,
                    he deprived Charles of the senatorship and appointed Rudolph vicar of Tuscany.
                    After declaring that he left to the people the right of electing the senator, he
                    promulgated a new constitution (18th of July 1278) which, while confirming the
                    rights of the church over the city, prohibited the election of any foreign
                    emperor, prince, marquis, count or baron as senator of Rome. Thus the Colonna,
                    Savelli, Orsini, Annibaldi and other Roman nobles again rose to power, and the
                    republic was again endangered and plunged in disorder. The Romans then gave the
                    reconstitution of the city into the pope’s hands by yielding to him the right of
                    nominating senators, declaring, however, that this was a personal concession to
                    himself, and not to the popes in general. So Nicholas proceeded to name
                    senators, alternating a Colonna with an Orsini, or simultaneously choosing one
                    of each fafc-tion. The same power over the senate was granted with the same
                    restriction to Martin IV. (1281-85), and he at once reelected Charles of Anjou.
                    Thus, greatly to the disgust of the Romans, the Capitol was again invaded by
                    French vicars, notaries, judges and soldiery. But the terrible blow dealt at
                    Charles’s power by the Sicilian Vespers (31st of March 1282) resounded even in
                    Rome. The Orsini, backed by the people, rose to arms, massacred the French
                    garrison, and quickly re-established a popular government. Giovanni Cencio, a
                    kinsman of the Orsini, was elected captain and defender of the people, and ruled
                    the city with the co-operation of the senator and a council of priors of the
                    gilds. This government was of brief duration, for, although the pope had
                    professed his willingness to tolerate the experiment, he quickly arranged fresh
                    terms, and, forsaking Charles of Anjou, again nominated two Roman senators. Pope
                    and king both died in 1285, and Nicholas IV. (1288-92), also holding sway over
                    the senate, favoured the Colonna in order to curb the growing mastery of the
                    Orsini. But thus there were two powerful houses instead of one. In fact,
                    Giovanni Colonna, when elected senator, ruled from the Capitol as an independent
                    sovereign, conducted in person the campaign against Viterbo, and subjected that
                    city to the republic on the 3rd of May 1291.</p>               <p>When one of the Gaetani, Boniface VIII. (1294-1303), was raised to the papal
                    chair, the extent of the Colonnas’ power became evident to all. Boniface opposed
                    them in order to aggrandize his own kin, and they showed equal virulence in
                    return. The Cardinals Colonna refused to acknowledge him as the legitimate pope,
                    and he excommunicated them and proclaimed a crusade against their house. Even
                    after he had subdued them and destroyed Palestrina, their principal fief, the
                    drama did not yet come to an end. Boniface had a very lofty conception of the
                    church, and desired to establish her supremacy over the state. The king of
                    France (Philip the Fair) believed, on the contrary, that the Angevin successes
                    entitled him to fill the place in Italy vacated by the Swabians, and to play the
                    master there. This led to a tremendous contest in which all the French sided
                    with their king. And shortly afterwards a plot was hatched against the pope by
                    the agents of France and the Colonna. These determined enemies of the pope met
                    with much favour in Rome, on account of the general irritation against the
                    Gaetani and the enormous power conferred on them by Boniface.</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0676" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0723.jp2"/>
               <p>Suffice it to say that they were now lords of the whole of lower Latium, from
                    Capo Circeo to Ninfa, from Ceprano to Subiaco. Thus Sciarra Colonna and a
                    Frenchman named Nogaret were able to fall on the pope at Anagni, insult him, and
                    take him prisoner. The people rising to his rescue, the conspirators were put to
                    flight. But when Boniface returned to Rome with the escort and protection of the
                    Orsini, who had made themselves masters of the city, he found that he was
                    virtually a captive in their hands. He felt this so keenly that he died of rage
                    and exhaustion on the nth of October 1303. The brief pontificate of his
                    successor Benedict XI. was followed by that of Clement V. (1305-14), a
                    Frenchman, who, instead of coming to Rome, summoned the cardinals to France.
                    This was the beginning of the church’s so called exile in Avignon, which,
                    although depriving Rome of a scource of wealth and influence, left the republic
                    to pursue its own course. It employed this freedom in trying to hold its own
                    against the nobles, whose power was much lessened by the absence of the pope,
                    and endeavoured to gain fresh strength by organizing the thirteen regions,
                    which, as we have shown, were associations of a much firmer nature in Rome than
                    the gilds. Accordingly, in</p>               <p>1305, a captain of the people was elected with thirteen elders and a senator,
                    Paganino della Torre, who governed for one year. The pope was opposed to these
                    changes at first, but in 1310 he issued a brief granting Rome full permission to
                    select its own form of government. Thus, the first pope in Avignon restored the
                    rights of the Romans. But the latter, even with church and empire so far
                    removed, still considered Rome the Eternal City, the source of all law, and the
                    only natural seat of the spiritual and temporal government of the world. To
                    their republic, they thought, appertained a new and lofty destiny, nor could it
                    ever be content to descend to the level of other Italian municipalities.</p>               <p>On the 6th of January 1309 Henry VII. was crowned king of the Romans at
                    Aix-la-Chapelle; and so greatly were men’s minds changed in Italy that,
                    throughout the land, he was hailed as a deliverer. He wished to restore the
                    grandeur of the empire, and the Italians, above all</p>               <p>Dante Alighieri, beheld in him the champion of the state against the church,
                    who, after becoming the foe of communal liberty, had forsaken Italy and
                    withdrawn to France. The Roman people shared these ideas, and awaited Henry with
                    equal impatience, but the nobles rose in opposition. The Orsini, leaders of the
                    Guelphs, and allied with Robert of Naples, took possession of the castle of St
                    Angelo and the Trastevere. Hence, when Henry reached Rome in May 1312, after
                    seizing the iron crown at Milan, he was obliged to act on the offensive. He took
                    the Capitol by assault, but, failing in his attack on the castle of St Angelo,
                    was pursued by its Neapolitan garrison. Forsaken by many discouraged adherents,
                    he was forced to recognize the expediency of departure. First, however, he
                    desired to be crowned at the Lateran, St Peter’s being held by his foes. The
                    cardinals refused his request, but were compelled to yield by the threats of the
                    people, who, reasserting their ancient rights, insisted that the coronation
                    should take place without delay. And the ceremony was performed on the 29th of
                    June 1312. The emperor then resolved to depart in spite of the popular protest
                    against his leaving the natural seat of the empire, and on -the 20th of August
                    started for Tuscany, where worse fortune awaited him.</p>               <p>Their differences settled, the nobles expelled the captain of the people left by
                    Henry, and elected as senators Sciarra Colonna and Francesco Orsini. But this
                    was the signal for a popular revolt. The Capitol was</p>               <p>attacked, the senators put to flight, and Jacopo Arlotti elected captain with a
                    council of twenty-six worthies <hi rend="italic">(buoni homing.</hi> The new
                    leader instantly summoned the chief nobles before his tribunal, had them chained
                    and cast into prison, and demolished many of their houses and strongholds. But,
                    having thus humiliated their pride, Arlotti dared not put them to death, and,
                    releasing them from confinement, banished them to their estates, where they
                    plunged into hostile preparations. Meanwhile the victorious people convoked a
                    parliament and decreed that, the aristocracy being now overthrown, the <hi
                        rend="italic">tribunitia potestas</hi> alone should invite the emperor to
                    make his triumphal entry into the Capitol, and receive his authority from the
                    people of Rome. This conception of the Roman power will now be seen to become
                    more and more definite until finding its last expression in Cola di Rienzi. Pope
                    Clement, resigning himself to necessity, acknowledged the new government under
                    the energetic rule of Arlotti. The latter now joined the Ghibellines of the
                    Campagna against the Orsini and the Neapolitans, subdued Velletri, and gave it a
                    podestà. But then the Gaetani, who were Guelphs, united with the Orsini and the
                    Neapolitans, and, giving battle to the Ghibellines in the Campagna, routed them
                    in such wise as to put an end to the popular government. The nobles forced their
                    way into the city, attacked the Capitol, made Arlotti their prisoner, and
                    re-elected the senators Sciarra Colonna and Francesco Orsini. Close upon these
                    reverses came the death of Henry VII. (24th of August 1313) at Buonconvento near
                    Siena, which put an end to the Ghibelline party in Italy. Thereupon King Robert
                    of Naples, being named senator by the pope, immediately appointed a vicar in
                    Rome. Clement likewise profited by the vacancy of the imperial throne to name
                    the king imperial vicar in Tuscany. And he died on the 20th of April 1314, well
                    content to have witnessed the triumphs of the Guelphs in Italy.</p>               <p>Affairs took a fresh turn under Pope John XXII. (1316-34). Rome was still ruled
                    by the vicars of King Robert; but, owing to the continued absence of the popes,
                    matters grew daily worse. Trade and industry declined, revenue diminished, the
                    impoverished nobles were exceedingly turbulent, deeds of murder and violence
                    occurred on all sides; even by day the streets of the city were unsafe. Hence
                    there was universal discontent. Meanwhile Louis the Bavarian, who in 1314 had
                    been crowned king of the Romans, having overcome his German enemies at Miihldorf
                    in 1322, turned against the pope, one of his fiercest opponents. Louis was
                    surrounded by Minorite friars, supporters of the poverty of the church, and
                    consequently enemies to the temporal power. They were men of the stamp of
                    William of Occam, Marsilio of Padua, Giovanni Janduno, and other philosophers
                    favourable to the rights of the empire and the people. Accordingly the Italian
                    Ghibellines hailed Louis as they had previously hailed Henry. Even the Roman
                    people were roused to action, and, driving out the representatives and partisans
                    of King Robert, in the spring of 1327, seized on the castle of St Angelo, and
                    again established a democratic government. <hi rend="sup">a</hi> Nearly all
                    Italy was stirred to new deeds,” says G. Villani, “and the Romans rose to arms
                    and organized the people ” (bk. x. c, 20). Regardless of the reproofs of the
                    pope, they elected a haughty Ghibelline,</p>               <p>Sciarra Colonna, captain of the people and general of the militia, with a
                    council of fifty-two <hi rend="italic">popolani)</hi> four to each region. Then,
                    ranged under the standards of the militia, the Romans gave chase to the foes of
                    the republic, and Sciarra, returning victorious, ascended to the Capitol and
                    invited Louis the Bavarian to Rome.</p>               <p>The summons was obeyed; on the 7th of January 1328 the king was «already
                    encamped in the Neronian Fields with five thousand horse and a considerable
                    number of foot soldiers, and, with better fortune than Henry VII., was able to
                    enter the Vatican at once.</p>               <p>Encircled by a crowd of heretics, reformers and Minorite brethren, he convoked a
                    parliament on the Capitol, asking that the imperial crown might be conferred
                    upon him by the people, from whon^ alone he wished to receive it. And the people
                    proclaimed him their captain, senator and emperor. On the 17th of January his
                    coronation took place in St Peter’s. But, as he had neither money nor practical
                    sense, his method of taxation and the excesses committed by himself and his
                    over-excited philosophers speedily aroused the popular discontent. His
                    ecclesiastical vicar, Marsilio of Padua, and</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0677" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0724.jp2"/>
               <p>Giovanni Janduno placarded the walls with insulting manifestoes against the
                    pope, whom the Minorites stigmatized as a heretic and wished to depose. In April
                    Louis twice assembled the parliament in St Peter’s Square, and, after obtaining
                    its sanction to several anti-papal edicts, declared John XXII. degraded and
                    deposed as a heretic. This was a very strange and novel spectacle, the more so
                    that, as was speedily proved, the Romans were stirred by no anti-Catholic
                    spirit, no yearning for religious reform. Jacopo Colonna, a canon of the
                    Lateran, was able to make his way into Rome with four masked companions, to
                    publicly read, at the top of his voice and before a great multitude, the
                    excommunication launched against the emperor by the deposed pope, to traverse
                    the entire city, and to withdraw unmolested to Palestrina. Meanwhile the emperor
                    contented himself with decreeing that henceforth the popes must reside in
                    Rome,—that if, when invited, they should fail to come they would be thereby held
                    deposed from the throne. As a logical consequence, proceedings were immediately
                    begun for the election of the new pope, Nicholas V., who on the 12th of May was
                    proclaimed by the popular voice in St Peter’s Square, and received the imperial
                    sanction. But this ephemeral drama came to an end when the emperor departed with
                    his antipope on the 4th of August. This caused the immediate downfall of the
                    democratic government. Bertoldo Orsini, who had returned to Rome with his
                    Guelphs, and Stefano Colonna were elected senators, and confirmed in the office
                    by Cardinal Giovanni Orsini in the name of the pope. A new parliament cancelled
                    the emperor’s edicts, and had them burnt by the public executioner. Later,
                    Nicholas, the antipope, went with a rope about his neck to make submission to
                    John XXII., and Louis promised to disavow and retract all that he had done
                    against the church, provided the sentence of excommunication were withdrawn.
                    This, however, was refused. Never had the empire fallen so low. Meanwhile King
                    Robert was again supreme in Rome, and, being re-elected senator, appointed
                    vicars there as before. Anarchy reigned. The city was torn by factions, and the
                    provinces rebelled against the French representatives of the pope, who, in their
                    ignorance of Italian affairs, were at a loss how to act.</p>               <p>And after the election of Benedict XII. (1334-42) confusion reached so great a
                    pitch that, on the expiration of Robert’s senatorial term, the Romans named
                    thirteen heads of regions to carry on the government with two senators, while
                    the king still sent vicars as before. The people, for the sake of peace, once
                    more granted the supremacy of the senate to the pope, and he nominated two
                    knights of Gubbio, Giacomo di Cante dei Gabrielli and Bosone Novello dei
                    Gabrielli, who were succeeded by two other senators the following year. But in
                    1339 the Romans attacked the Capitol, named two senators of their own choice,
                    re-established a democratic government, and sent ambassadors to Florence to ask
                    for the ordinances of justice <hi rend="italic">(ordinamenti della
                        giustizia),</hi> by which that city had broken the power of the nobles, and
                    also that a few skilled citizens should lend their help in the reconstitution of
                    Rome. Accordingly some Florentines came with the <hi rend="italic"
                        >ordinamenti,</hi> some portions of which may be recognized in the Roman
                    statutes, and, after first rearranging the taxes, elected thirteen priors of the
                    gilds, a gonfalonier of justice; and a captain of the people after the
                    Florentine manner. But there was a dissimilarity in the conditions of the two
                    cities. The gilds having Ettle influence in Rome, the projected reform failed,
                    and the pope, who was opposed to it, reelected the senators. Thereupon public
                    discontent swelled, and especially when, by the foundation of the papal palace
                    of Avignon, it was evident that Benedict XII. had no intention of restoring the
                    Holy See to Italy. This pope was succeeded in 1342 by Clement VI. (1342-52), and
                    King Robert in 1343 by his niece Joanna; and the latter event, while plunging
                    the kingdom in anarchy, likewise aggravated the condition of Rome. For not only
                    were the Neapolitan sovereigns still very powerful there, but the principal
                    Roman nobles held large fiefs across</p>               <p>the Neapolitan borders.</p>               <p>Shortly before this another revolution in Rome had reestablished the government
                    of the thirteen elders and the two senators. The people, being anxious to show
                    their intention of respecting the papal authority, had despatched to Avignon as
                    ambassador of the republic, in 1343, a man destined to make much noise in the
                    world. This was Cola di Rienzi, son of a Roman innkeeper, a notary, and an
                    impassioned student of the Bible, the fathers, Livy, Seneca, Cicero, and
                    Valerius Maximus. Thoroughly imbued with a half pagan, half Christian spirit, he
                    believed that he had a divinely inspired mission to revive the ancient glories
                    of Rome. Of handsome presence, full of fantastic eloquence, and stirred to
                    enthusiasm by contemplation of the ruined monuments of Rome, he harangued the
                    people with a stilted oratory that enchanted their ears. He hated the nobles,
                    because one of his brothers had been killed by them; he loved the republic, and
                    in its name addressed a stately Latin speech to the astonished pope, and,
                    offering him the supreme power, besought his instant return to Rome. He also
                    begged him to allow the city to celebrate a jubilee every fifty years, and then,
                    as a personal request, asked to be nominated notary to the urban chamber. The
                    pope consented to everything, and Rienzi communicated this good news to Rome in
                    an emphatically worded epistle. After Easter, in 1344, he returned to Rome, and
                    found to his grief that the city was a prey to the nobles. He immediately began
                    to admonish the latter, and then, draped in a toga adorned with symbols,
                    exhibited and explained allegorical designs to the people, and announced the
                    speedy restoration of the past grandeur of Rome. Finally he and a few burghers
                    and merchants, whom he had secretly inflamed by his discourses, made a solemn
                    vow to overthrow the nobility and consolidate the republic. The moment was
                    favourable, owing to the anarchy of Naples, the absence of the pope, the
                    weakness of the empire and the disputes of the barons, although the latter were
                    still very potent and constituted, as it were, a separate government opposed to
                    that of the people. Rienzi, having gained the pope’s ecclesiastical vicar to his
                    side, passed in prayer the night of the 19th of May 1347, placing his enterprise
                    under the protection of the Holy Spirit, and the following day marched to the
                    Capitol, surrounded by his adherents, convoked a parliament of the people, and
                    obtained its sanction for the following proposals:—that all pending lawsuits
                    should be at once decided; that justice should be equally administered to all;
                    that every region should equip one hundred foot soldiers and twenty-five horse;
                    that the dues and taxes should be rearranged; that the forts, bridges and gates
                    of the city should be held by the rector of the people instead of by the
                    nobility; and that granaries should be opened for the public use. On the same
                    day, amid general homage and applause, Rienzi was proclaimed head of the
                    republic, with the title of tribune and liberator of the Holy Roman Republic, “
                    by authority of the most merciful Lord Jesus Christ.” The nobles withdrew
                    scoffing but alarmed. Rienzi engaged a body-guard of one hundred men, and
                    assumed the command of thirteen hundred infantry and three hundred and ninety
                    h’ght horse; he abolished the senators, retained the Thirteen and the general
                    and special councils, and set the administration on a new footing. These
                    measures and the prompt submission of the other cities of the state brought an
                    instant increase of revenue to Rome.</p>               <p>This revolution, as will be noted, was of an entirely novel stamp. For its
                    leader despatched envoys to all the cities of Italy, exhorting them to shake off
                    the yoke of their tyrants, and send representatives to the parliament convoked
                    for the 1 st of August, inasmuch as the liberation of Rome also implied the “
                    liberation of the sacred land of Italy.” In Rienzi’s judgment the Roman
                    revolution must be, not municipal, but national, and even in some points
                    universal. And this idea was welcomed with general enthusiasm throughout the
                    peninsula. Solemn festivals and processions were held in Rome; and, when the
                    tribune went in state to St Peter’s, the canons met him on the steps chanting
                    the <hi rend="italic">Veni, Creator Spiritus.</hi> Even the pope, willingly or
                    unwillingly, accorded his approval to</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0678" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0725.jp2"/>
               <p>Rienzi’s deeds. The provincial cities did homage to Rome and her tribune, and
                    almost all the rest of Italy gave him its enthusiastic adherence. The ancient
                    sovereign people seemed on the point of resuscitation. And others besides the
                    multitude were fascinated and carried off their feet. Great men like Petrarch
                    were transported with joy. The poet lauded Cola di Rienzi as a sublime and
                    supernatural being, the greatest of ancient and modern men. But it was soon
                    evident that all this enthusiasm was mainly factitious. On the 26th of July a
                    new parliament was called, and this decreed that all the rights and privileges
                    granted to the empire and church must now be vested in the Roman people, from
                    whom they had first emanated. But on the convocation of the national parliament
                    few representatives obeyed the summons and the scheme was a failure. All had
                    gone well so long as principles only were proclaimed, but when words had to be
                    followed by deeds the municipal feeling awoke and distrust began to prevail.
                    Nevertheless, on the 1st of August Rienzi assumed the spurs of knighthood and
                    passed a decree declaring that Rome would now resume her old jurisdiction over
                    the world, invoking the Holy Spirit upon Italy, granting the Roman citizenship
                    to all her cities, and proclaiming them free in virtue of the freedom of Rome.
                    This was a strange jumble of the ancient Roman idea.combined with the medieval.
                    It was a dream of Rienzi’s brain, but it was also the dream of Dante and
                    Petrarch. The conception of the empire and the history of Italy, particularly
                    that of ancient and medieval Rome, were inevitably preparing the way for the
                    national idea. This Rienzi foresaw, and this constitutes the true grandeur of
                    his character, which in other respects was not exempt from pettiness and
                    infirmity. He pursued his course, therefore, undismayed, and had indeed gone too
                    far to draw back. On the 15th of August he caused himself to be crowned tribune
                    with great pomp, and confirmed the rights of Roman citizenship to all natives of
                    Italy. But practical matters had also to be taken into account, and it was here
                    that his weakness and lack of judgment were shown. The nobles remained steadily
                    hostile, and refused to yield to the charm of his words. Hence conflict was
                    unavoidable; and at first Rienzi succeeded in vanquishing the Gaetani by means
                    of Giovanni Colonna. He next endeavoured to suppress the Guelph and Ghibelline
                    factions, and to restore Italy to " holy union ” by raising her from her present
                    abasement.</p>               <p>The pope, however, was weary of toleration, and, coming to terms with the
                    nobles, incited them to war. They accordingly moved from Palestrina, and on the
                    30th of -November were encamped before Rome. Rienzi now put forth his energy. He
                    had already called the militia to arms, and a genuine battle took place in which
                    eighty nobles, chiefly of the Colonna clan, were left dead. This was a real
                    catastrophe to them, and the aristocracy never again achieved the rule of the
                    republic. But Rienzi’s head was turned by this sudden success. In great need of
                    money, he began to play the tyrant by levying taxes and exacting instant
                    obedience. The papal legate saw his opportunity and seized it, by threatening to
                    bring a charge of heresy against the tribune. Rienzi was dismayed. He declared
                    himself friendly to the pope and willing to respect his authority; and he even
                    sought to conciliate the nobles. At this moment certain Neapolitan and Hungarian
                    captains, after levying soldiers with the tribune’s consent, joined the nobles
                    and broke out in revolt. On their proving victorious in a preliminary encounter
                    with some of Rienzi’s guards, the tribune suddenly lost heart, resigned the
                    power he had held for seven months, and took refuge with a few trusty adherents
                    in the castle of St Angelo on the 15th December 1347. Thence he presently fled
                    to Naples, vainly hoping to find aid, and afterwards disappeared for some time
                    from the scene.</p>               <p>Meanwhile the Romans remained tranquil, intent on making money by the jubilee;
                    but no sooner was this over than disorders broke out and the tyranny of the
                    baronage recommenced. To remedy this state of things, application was made to
                    the pope. He consulted with a committee of cardinals, who sought the advice of
                    Petrarch, and the poet suggested a popular government, to the complete exclusion
                    of the nobles, since these, he said, were strangers who ruined the city. The
                    people had already elected the Thirteen, and now, encouraged by these counsels,
                    on the 26th of December 1351 chose Giovanni Perrone as head of the republic. But
                    the new leader was unable to withstand the hostilities of the nobles; and in
                    September 1353 Francesco Baroncelli was elected tribune. He was a follower of
                    Rienzi, had been his ambassador to Florence and did little beyond imitating his
                    mode of government and smoothing the way for his return.</p>               <p>Rienzi had spent two years in the Abruzzi, leading a life of mystic
                    contemplation on Monte Maiella. Then, in 13 so, he had gone to Prague and
                    endeavoured to convert to his ideas the yet uncrowned emperor Charles IV. When
                    apparently on the point of success, he was sent under arrest to the new pope,
                    Innocçpt VI. (1352-62), a man of great shrewdness and practical sense. On
                    Rienzi’s arrival at Avignon it became evident that his popularity was still very
                    great, and that it would be no easy task to dispose of him. The Romans were
                    imploring his return; Petrarch lauded him as a modern Gracchus or Scipio; and
                    the pope finally released him from confinement. Innocent had decided to send to
                    Italy, in order to settle affairs and bring the state into subjection to the
                    church, that valiant captain and skilled politician, Cardinal Albornoz. And,
                    having no fear that the latter’s hand would be forced, he further decided that
                    Rienzi should be sent to give him the support of his own popularity in Rome. In
                    fact, directly the pair arrived Baroncelli was overthrown, the supremacy of the
                    senate granted to the pope and the government confided to Albornoz, who, without
                    concerning himself with Rienzi, nominated Guido Patrizi as senator. He then
                    marched at the head of his troops against Giovanni, prefect of Vico, and forced
                    him to render stÆmission at Montefiascone on the 5th of June 1354. With the same
                    promptitude and skilT he reduced Umbria and the Tuscan and Sabine districts,
                    consented to leave the privileges of the cities intact in return for their
                    recognition of the papal authority and planted fortresses in suitable positions.
                    In the meantime Rienzi’s popularity was increasing in Rome; without either money
                    or arms, the extribune succeeded by his eloquence in winning over the two
                    Provençal leaders, brothers of the famous free captain Fra Monreale; and,
                    seduced by his promises and hopes, they supplied him with funds. Then, profiting
                    by his prestige, the apparent favour of the pope, and the sums received, he was
                    able to collect a band of five hundred soldiers of mixed nationalities and
                    returned towards Rome. On Monte Mario he was met by the <hi rend="italic"
                        >cavalier otti.</hi> On the 1st of August 1354 he entered the Gastello gate,
                    took possession of the government, named Mon-reale’s two brothers his captains,
                    and sent them to lay siege to Palestrina, which was still the headquarters of
                    the Colonna. But then money ran short, and he again lost his head. Inviting Fra
                    Monreale to a banquet, he put him to death for the sake of his wealth, and kept
                    the two brothers in confinement. This act excited general indignation. And when,
                    after his ill-gotten gains were spent, he again recurred to violence to fill his
                    purse, the public discontent was vented in a sudden revolt on the 8th of
                    October. The people stormed the Capitol with cries of “ Death to the traitor.”
                    Rienzi presented himself at a window waving the flag of Rome. But the charm was
                    finally broken. Missiles were hurled at him; the palace was fired. He hid
                    himself in the courtyard, shaved his beard and, disguised as a shepherd with a
                    cloth over his head, slipped into the crowd and joined in their cries against
                    himself. Being recognized, however, by the golden bracelets he had forgotten to
                    remove, he was instantly stabbed. For two days his corpse was left exposed to
                    the insults of the mob, and was then burned. Such was the wretched end of thé"
                    man who, at one moment, seemed destined to fill the world with his name as the
                    regenerator of Rome and of Italy.</p>               <p>In all the Italian cities the overthrow of the aristocracy had led to military
                    impotence and pressing danger of tyranny. The same thing had happened in Rome
                    when the nobility, weakened by the absence of church and empire, received its
                    death-blow</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0679" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0726.jp2"/>
               <p>from Rienzi. But, whereas, elsewhere tyrants were gradually arising in the
                    citizen class, Rome was always in danger of oppression by the pope. Nor was any
                    aid available from the empire, which had never recovered from its abasement
                    under Louis the Bavarian. In fact, when Charles of Luxemburg came to Rome to be
                    crowned, he was obliged to promise the pope that he would not enter the city. On
                    Easter day 1355 he received the crown, and departed after counselling the Romans
                    to obey the pope. And the pontiffs had greater need than ever of an established
                    kingdom. Their position in France was much endangered by that country’s
                    disorder. New states were being formed on all sides ; the medieval unityx was
                    shattered ; and the shrunken spiritual authority of the church increased her
                    need of material strength. As Italian affairs stood, it would be easy for the
                    popes to found a kingdom, but their presence was required in Rome before it
                    could be firmly established. The blood-stained sword of Albornoz had prepared
                    the way before them. In 1355-56 he vanquished the lords or tyrants of Rimini,
                    Fano, Fossombrone, Pesaro, Urbino and other cities. And all these places had,
                    been so rudely oppressed that the cardinal was often hailed as a liberator after
                    subduing their masters by fire and sword. But everywhere he had been obliged to
                    leave existing governments and rulers <hi rend="italic">in statu quo</hi> after
                    exacting their oaths of fealty. Thus the state was still dissevered, and it was
                    impossible to bind it together with the pope at Avignon and Rome a republic.
                    Bologna was still independent, Ordelaffi still lord of Forlì; Cesena and other
                    cities were still rebellious; and the Campagna was still in the hands of the
                    barons. Some places were ruled by rectors nominated by the pope; at
                    Montefiascone there was an ecclesiastical rector, with a bench of judges, and a
                    captain commanding a mixed band of adventurers. Rome had submitted to the
                    haughty cardinal, but hated him mortally, and, on his departure for Avignon in
                    1357 to assist the threatened pontiff, immediately conceded to the latter the
                    supremacy of the senate. And the pope, instead of two senators, hastened to name
                    a single one of foreign birth. This was a shrewd device of Albornoz and another
                    blow to the nobles, with whom he was still at war.</p>               <p>Thus was inaugurated, by fhe nomination of Raimondo de’</p>               <p>Tolomei in 1358, a series of foreign senators, fulfilling the functions of a
                    podestà, and changed every six months, together with their staff of judges,
                    notaries and knights.- The people approved of this reform as being inimical to
                    the nobles and favourable to the preservation of liberty. Hitherto the senators
                    had been assisted, or rather kept in check, by the thirteen representatives of
                    the regions. These were now replaced by seven reformers, in imitation of the
                    priors of Florence, the better to follow that city’s example. The reformers were
                    soon the veritable chiefs of the republic. They first appeared in 1360, were
                    either <hi rend="italic">popolani</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cavalier otti,</hi>
                    and were elected by ballot every three months. When Albornoz returned to Italy,
                    although desirous to keep Rome in the same subjection as the other cities, he
                    had first to vanquish Ordelaffi and reduce Bologna. The latter enterprise was
                    the more difficult task, and provoked a lengthy war with Matteo Visconti of
                    Milan. Thus Rome, being left to herself, continued to be governed by her
                    reformers; and the nobles, already shut out from power, were also excluded from
                    the militia, which had been reorganized, like that of Florence, on the
                    democratic system.</p>               <p>Three thousand men, mostly archers, were enrolled under the command of two <hi
                        rend="italic">banderesi,</hi> “ in the likeness,” says M. Villani, <hi
                        rend="sup">u</hi> of our gonfaloniers of the companies, ” with four <hi
                        rend="italic">antepositi</hi> constituting a supreme council of war. And the
                    whole body was styled the <hi rend="sup">(i</hi> Felix Societas Balestrariorum
                    et Pavesatorum. ” It was instituted to support the reformers and re-establish
                    order in the city and Campagna, to keep down the nobles and defend the republic.
                    It fulfilled these duties with much, and sometimes excessive, severity. <hi
                        rend="italic">Banderesi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">antepositi</hi> had seats
                    in the special council beside those of the reformers, as, in Florence, the
                    gonfaloniers of the companies were seated beside the priors. Later these
                    officials constituted the so-called <hi rend="italic">signoria dei
                        banderesi.</hi> In 1362, the Romans having subjected Velletri, which was
                    defended by the nobles, the latter made a riot in Rome. Thereupon the <hi
                        rend="italic">banderesi</hi> drove them all from the city, killed some of
                    their kindred, and did not even spare the <hi rend="italic">cavallerotti.</hi>
                    The fight became so furious that from gate to gate all Rome was in arms, and
                    even mercenaries were hired. But in the end renewed submission was made to the
                    pope.</p>               <p>On the death of Innocent VI. in 1362, an agreement was concluded with his
                    successor, Urban V. (1362-70), also a Frenchman, who was obliged to give his
                    sanction to the government of the reformers and <hi rend="italic"
                        >banderesi.</hi> And then, Albornoz being recalled in disgrace to Avignon,
                    and afterwards sent as legate to Naples, these Roman magistrates were able, with
                    or without the co-operation of the foreign senator, to rule in their own way.
                    They did justice on the nobles by hanging a few more; and they defended the city
                    from the threatening attacks of the mercenaries, who had now become Italy’s
                    worst foes. It was at this period that the Roman statutes were revised and
                    rearranged in the compilation erroneously attributed by some writers to
                    Albornoz, which has come down to us supplemented by alterations of a later date.</p>               <p>But now the popes, being no longer in safety at Avignon, really decided to
                    return to Italy. Even Urban V. had to pay ransom to escape from the threatened
                    attacks of the free companies. The Romans implored his return, and he was
                    further urged to it by the Italian <hi rend="italic">literati,</hi> with
                    Petrarch at their head. In April 1367 he finally quitted Avignon, and, entering
                    Rome on the 16th of October, was given the lordship of the city. Cardinal
                    Albornoz had fallen mortally ill at Viterbo, but, though unable to accompany the
                    pope to Rome, had, before dying, suggested his course of action. Certainly Urban
                    showed much acumen in profiting by the first burst of popular enthusiasm to
                    effect quick and dexterous changes in the constitution of the republic. After
                    naming a senator, he abolished the posts of reformers and <hi rend="italic"
                        >banderesi,</hi> substituting three conservators, or rather a species of
                    municipal council, alone charged with judicial and administrative powers, which
                    has lasted to the present day. The thirteen leaders of the regions and the
                    consuls of the ¿Ids still sat in the councils, which were left unsuppressed. But
                    all real power was in the hands of the pope, who, in Rome, as in his other
                    cities, nominated the principal magistrates. Thus, by transforming political
                    into civil institutions and concentrating the supreme authority in his own
                    grasp, Urban V. dealt a mortal blow to the liberties of Rome. Yet he felt no
                    sense of security among a people who, after the first rejoicings over the return
                    of the Holy See, were always on the brink of revolt. Besides, he felt himself a
                    stranger in Italy, and was so regarded. Accordingly, in April 1370 he decided to
                    return to France; on the 20th of that month he wrote from Viterbo that no change
                    was to be made in the government; and he died in Avignon on the 19th of
                    December.</p>               <p>The Romans retained the conservators, conferring on them the political power of
                    the reformers; they re-established the <hi rend="italic">banderesi</hi> with the
                    Florentine title of <hi rend="italic">exccutores jus* titiae</hi> and the four
                        <hi rend="italic">antepositi</hi> with that of <hi rend="italic"
                        >consiliarii.</hi>
               </p>               <p>Thus the “ Felix Societas Balestrariorum et Pavesatorum Urbis ” was restored,
                    and the two councils met as before. The new French pope, Gregory XI.</p>               <p>(1370-78), had to be content with obtaining supremacy over the senate and the
                    possession of the castle of St Angelo. It was a difficult moment for him. The
                    Florentines had come to an open rupture with his legates, and had adopted the
                    expedient of inviting all the cities of the Roman state to redeem their lost
                    freedom. Accordingly, in 1375 many of them rose against the legates, who were
                    mostly French and regarded with dislike as foreigners. Florentine despatches,
                    full of classical allusions and chiefly composed by the famous scholar Secretary
                    Coluccio Salutati, were rapidly sent in all directions. Those addressed to the
                    Romans w’ere specially fervid, and emphatically appealed to their patriotism and
                    memories of</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0680" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0727.jp2"/>
               <p>the past. But the Romans received them with doubt and mistrust, for they saw
                    that the revolution threatened to dismember the state, by promoting the
                    independence of every separate city. Besides, while maintaining their republic,
                    they also desired the pope’s presence in Rome. Nevertheless, they went with the
                    current to the extent of reforming their constitution. In February 1376 they
                    nominated Giovanni Cenci captain of the people, and gave him uncontrolled power
                    over the towns of the patrimony and the Sabine land. The conservators, with
                    their new political authority, the <hi rend="italic">executores,</hi> the <hi
                        rend="italic">antepositi</hi> and the two councils were all preserved, and a
                    new magistracy was created, the “Tres Gubematores Pacis et Libcrtatis
                    Reipublicae Romanae.” This answered to the Eight (afterwards Ten) of War in
                    Florence, likewise frequently called the Eight of Liberty and Peace. It was this
                    Council of Eight that was now directing the war against the pope and braving his
                    sentence of excommunication; and their fiery zeal had won them the title of the
                    Holy Eight from the Florentines.</p>               <p>Realizing that further absence would cost him his state, Gregory XI. quitted
                    Avignon on the 13th of September 1376, and, reaching Corneto in December,
                    despatched to Rome three legates, who, on the 21st of the month, concluded an
                    agreement with the parliament. The people gave up the gates, the fortresses and
                    the Trastevcre, and promised that if the pope returned to Rome he should have
                    the same powers which had been granted to Urban V. But, on his side, he must
                    pledge himself to maintain the <hi rend="italic">executores</hi> and their
                    council, and allow the Romans the right of reforming the <hi rend="italic"
                        >banderesi,</hi> who would then swear fealty to him. The terms of this peace
                    and the pope’s epistles clearly prove that the two councils still exercised
                    their functions, that the <hi rend="italic">banderesi wee</hi> still the virtual
                    heads of the government, and that their suppression was not contemplated. In
                    fact, when the pope made his entry on the 17th of January 1377, accompanied by
                    two thousand armed men, he perceived that there was much public agitation, that
                    the Romans did not intend to fulfil their agreement, and that the government of
                    the <hi rend="italic">banderesi</hi> went on as before. Accordingly, after
                    naming Gomez Albornoz, a nephew' of the deceased cardinal, to the office of
                    senator, he retired to Anagni, and remained there until November 1377. The
                    Romans presently waited on him with conciliating offers, and begged him to
                    negotiate a peace for them with the prefect of Vico. In fact, the treaty was
                    concluded at Anagni in October, and on the 10th of November confirmed in Rome by
                    the general council. The meeting was held in the great hall of the Capitol, <hi
                        rend="italic">ubi consilia generalia urbis fieri solent,</hi> in the
                    presence of all the members of the republican government. But the pope was
                    enraged by the survival of this government, and, being worn out by the
                    persistent hostility of the Florentines, which reduced his power to a low ebb,
                    had determined to make peace, when surprised by death on the 27th of March 1378.</p>               <p>The next pope, Urban VI. (1378-89), a Neapolitan, was the spirit of discord
                    incarnate. His election was not altogether regular: the French party among the
                    cardinals was against him; and the people were ripe for insurrection. But,
                    regardless of all this, Urban threatened the cardinals in his first consistory,
                    saying that church reform must begin with them; and he used the same tone with
                    the people, reproving them for failing to suppress the <hi rend="italic"
                        >banderesi.</hi> In consequence of this the cardinals of the French party,
                    assembling at Fondi, elected the antipope Clement VII. (1378-94) and started a
                    long and painful schism in the church. Clement resided in Avignon, while Urban
                    in Rome was engaged in opposing Queen Joanna I. of Naples and favouring Charles
                    of Durazzo, who, on conquering the Neapolitan kingdom, was made gonfalonier of
                    the church and senator of Rome, where he left a vicar as his deputy. Shortly
                    afterwards the pope went to Naples, and made fierce war on the king. Then, after
                    many .adventures, during which he tortured and put to death several cardinals
                    whom he suspected of hostile intentions, he returned to Rome, where the utmost
                    disorder prevailed. The conservators and the <hi rend="italic">banderesi</hi>
                    were still at the head of the government, and, the pope speedily falling out
                    with them, a riot ensued, after which he excommunicated the <hi rend="italic"
                        >banderesi.</hi> These at last made submission to him, and Urban VI. became
                    master of Rome before his death in 1389. He was succeeded by Boniface IX.
                    (1389-1404), another Neapolitan, but a man of greater shrewdness and capacity.
                    His first act was to crown Ladislaus king of Naples, and secure the friendship
                    and protection of this ambitious and powerful prince. In all the principal
                    cities of the state he chose the reigning lords for his vicars. But he allowed,
                    Fermo, Ascoli and Bologna the privilege of assuming their own vicariate for
                    twenty-five years. And, as.these different potentates and governments had only
                    to pay him an annual tribute, all parties were satisfied, and the pope was able
                    to bestow at least an appearance of order and unity on his state. But fresh
                    tumults soon arose, partly because the conservators and <hi rend="italic"
                        >banderesi</hi> sought to govern on their own account, and especially
                    because the pope seems for a time to have omitted naming the senator. Boniface
                    was a prudent man; he saw tliat events were turning in his favour, now that
                    throughout Italy liberty was tottering to its fall, and bided his time. He was
                    satisfied for the moment by obtaining a recognition of the immunities of the
                    clergy, rendering them solely amenable to ecclesiastical tribunals,- and thus
                    distinguishing the powers of the church from those of the state in Rome. The
                    republic also pledged itself neither to molest the prelates nor to levy fresh
                    contributions on them towards repairing the walls, to aid in recovering the
                    estates of the church in Tuscia, and to try to conciliate the baronage. This
                    concordat, concluded with the conservators and <hi rend="italic">banderesi</hi>
                    on the nth of September 1391, was also confirmed on the 5th of March 1392 by the
                    heads of the regions, together with a fresh treaty binding both parties to
                    furnish a certain number of armed men to combat the prefect of Vico and the
                    adherents of the antipope at Viterbo. With the exception of this city, Orchi and
                    Civita Vecchia, all other conquered territory was to belong to the republic. But
                    the Romans soon discovered that they were playing into the hands of the pope,
                    who kept everything for himself, without even paying the troops. Upon this a
                    riot broke out; Boniface fled to Perugia in October 1392, and resolved to exact
                    better terms when next recalled to Rome. Meanwhile the Romans subdued the
                    prefect, captured Viterbo, and, being already repentant, handed it over to the
                    pope and implored his return. He then proposed his own terms, which were
                    approved, not only by the conservators, <hi rend="italic">banderesi</hi> and
                    four councillors, but also by the special council and by the unanimous vote of a
                    general assembly, composed of the above-mentioned authorities, heads of regions,
                    other officials and a hundred citizens (8th August 1393). These terms prescribed
                    that the pope was to elect the senator, and that, on his failing so to do, the
                    conservators would carry on the government after swearing fealty to him. The
                    senatorial function was to be neither controlled nor hampered by the <hi
                        rend="italic">banderesi.</hi> The immunities of the clergy were to be
                    preserved, and all church property was to be respected by the magistrates. The
                    expenses of the pope’s journey were to be paid, and he was to be escorted to
                    Rome in state. Boniface tried to complete his work by abolishing the <hi
                        rend="italic">banderesi,</hi> the last bulwarks of freedom; but the people,
                    although weakened and weary, made efforts to preserve them and, although their
                    fall was inevitable, the struggle went on for some time.</p>               <p>During the spring of 1394 the <hi rend="italic">banderesi</hi> provoked an
                    insurrection in which the .pope’s life was endangered; it was only saved by the
                    arrival of King Ladislaus, who came from Naples with a large force in the early
                    autumn. But for the Neapolitan soldiery Boniface could not have withstood the
                    long series of revolts that continually exposed him to fresh perils and the
                    anxiety caused by the persistent schism of the church. The death of Clement VII.
                    in 1394 was followed by the election of</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0681" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0728.jp2"/>
               <p>another antipope, Benedict XIII. But a new jubilee was in* prospect for the year
                    1400, and this was always an efficacious means of bending the will of the
                    Romans. Depending upon this and the assistance of Ladislaus, Boniface not only
                    demanded full powers to nominate senators (none having been recently elected),
                    but insisted on the suppression of the <hi rend="italic">banderesi.</hi> Both
                    requests were granted; but, directly Angelo Alaleoni was made senator, a
                    conspiracy was hatched for the re-establishment of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >banderesi.</hi> However, the pope felt sure of his strength; the</p>               <p>plot was discovered and the conspirators were beheaded on the stairs of the
                    Capitol. This proved the end of the <hi rend="italic">banderesi</hi> and of the
                    liberties of Rome. The government ¡was again directed by an alien senator
                    together with three conservators; but the latter were gradually deprived of
                    their political attributes, and became mere civil officers. The militia,
                    regions, gilds and other associations now rapidly lost all political importance,
                    and before long were little more than empty names. Thus in 1398 the Romans
                    submitted to the complete sway of the pope, and in July of the same year the
                    senator chosen by him was Malatesta dei Malatesti of Rimini, one of a line of
                    tyrants, a valiant soldier, who was also temporal vicar and captain-general of
                    the church. Boniface continued to appoint foreign senators during the rest of
                    his life; he fortified the castle of St Angelo, the Vatican and the Capitol; he
                    stationed galleys at the mouth of the Tiber, and proved himself in all things a
                    thoroughly temporal prince. He aggrandized all his kindred, especially his
                    brother, and, with the aid of his senator, his armed force and the protection of
                    Ladislaus, succeeded in keeping down all the surviving nobles. In 1400, however,
                    these made an attempt to upset the government. Niccolo Colonna forced his way
                    into the city with cries of “ Popolo, popolo! death to Boniface! ” But the
                    Romans had grown deaf to the voice of liberty; they refused to rise, and the
                    senator, a Venetian named Zaccaria Trevisan, behaved with much energy. Colonna
                    and his men had to beat a swift retreat to Palestrina. A charge of high treason
                    was immediately instituted against him, and thirty-one rebels were beheaded. The
                    pope then proclaimed a crusade against all the Colonna, and sent a body of two
                    thousand men and some of the Neapolitan soldiery to attack them. Several of
                    their estates were seized and devastated, but Palestrina continued to hold out,
                    and on the 7th of January 1401 the Colonna finally made submission to the pope.
                    Nevertheless, they obtained advantageous terms, for Boniface left them their
                    lands, appointed them vicars of other territories, and made similar agreements
                    with the Gaetani and Orsini. In this way he became absolute master of Rome. One
                    chronicler remarks that “ Romanis tanquam rigidus imperator dominabatur,” and
                    the same tone is taken by others. But he did not succeed in putting an end to
                    the schism of the church, which was still going on when he died in the Vatican
                    on the 1st of October 1404.</p>               <p>Innocent VII. (1404-6) was the next pope. He too was a Neapolitan, and on his
                    election the people again rose in revolt <hi rend="underline">an</hi> d refused
                    to acknowledge him unless he consented to resign the temporal power. But
                    Ladislaus of Naples hastened to his help, and an agreement was made which, under
                    the cover of apparent concessions, really riveted the people’s chains. Rome was
                    recognized as the seat of the temporal and spiritual sovereignty of the pope,
                    and the pope continued to appoint the senator. The people were to elect seven
                    governors of the city, who were to swear fealty to the pope and carry on the
                    government in conjunction with three other governors chosen by the pontiff or
                    Ladislaus. The stipulations of Boniface IX. concerning ecclesiastical immunities
                    were again confirmed. The barons were forbidden to place more than five lances
                    each at the service of the people, and—which was the real gist of the covenant—
                    the people were henceforth forbidden to make laws or statutes without the
                    permission of the pope. The captain of the people, deprived of his political and
                    judicial functions and reduced to a simple judge, was also to be chosen by the
                    pope. But this treaty, drawn up on the 27th of October 1404, was not signed at
                    the time, and many difficulties and disturbances arose when its terms were to be
                    put into effect. The Romans nominated the seven governors, but, without waiting
                    until the pope had chosen three more, placed the state in their hands, and
                    styled them <hi rend="sup">u</hi> governors of the liberty of the Roman
                    Republic.” They were, in fact, <hi rend="italic">banderesi</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">reformatori</hi> under a new name. But the attempt proved
                    inefficacious, for, at the pope’s first threat of departure, the Romans made
                    their submission, and the treaty of October was subscribed on the 15th of May
                    1405. Nevertheless, as it only bears the signatures of the “ seven governors of
                    the liberty of the Roman Republic,” the pope would seem to have made some
                    concessions. His position was by no means assured. Ladislaus was known to aspire
                    to absolute dominion in Italy, and, although willing to aid in suppressing the
                    republic, tried to prepare the way for his own designs, and frequently held out
                    a helping hand to the vanquished. On the 6th of August fourteen influential
                    citizens of Rome boldly presented themselves at the Vatican, and in a
                    threatening manner called the pope to account for giving his whole attention to
                    worldly things, instead of endeavouring to put a stop to the schisms of the
                    church. But, on leaving his presence, they were attacked by Luigi Migliorati,
                    the pope’s nephew, and notorious for his violence, who killed eleven of their
                    number, including several heads of the regions and two of the governors. An
                    insurrection ensued, and the pope and his nephew fled to Viterbo. The Colonna
                    tried to profit by these events, and applied to Ladislaus, who, hoping that the
                    moment had come to make himself master of Rome, sent the count of Troia thither
                    with a troop of three thousand horse. But the people’, enraged by this
                    treachery, and determined not to fall under the yoke of Naples, awoke for an
                    instant to the memory of their past glories, and bravely repulsed the Colonna
                    and the Neapolitans. And, on the speedy arrival of the Orsini with some of the
                    papal troops, the people voluntarily restored the papal government, and,
                    assembling the parliament, besought the pope to return on his own terms.
                    Accordingly, after first naming Francesco Pancia-tichi of Pistoia to the
                    senatorship, the pope came back on the 13th of March 1406, bringing his whole
                    curia with him, and also the murderer Migliorati, who, triumphing in impunity,
                    became more arrogant than before. Here indeed was a proof that the Romans were
                    no longer worthy of liberty! And now, by means of the Orsini, Innocent had only
                    to reduce the Colonna and other nobles raised to power by Ladislaus; nor was
                    this very difficult, seeing that the king, in his usual fashion, abandoned them
                    to their fate, and, making terms with the pope, was named gonfalonier of the
                    church and again protected her cause.</p>               <p>Innocent, dying in 1406, was succeeded by Gregory XII., a Venetian, who, as we
                    shall presently see, resigned the chair in 1415. On his accession, finding his
                    state firmly established, he seemed to be seriously bent on putting an end to
                    the Great Schism, and for that purpose arranged a meeting with the antipope
                    Benedict XIII. at the congress of Savona in 140S. But Gregory and Benedict only
                    used the congress as a pretext for making war upon each other, and were urged on
                    by Ladislaus, who hoped by weakening both to gain possession of Rome, where,
                    although opposed by the Orsini, he had the support of the Colonna. Gregory, who
                    had then fled from Rome, made a momentary attempt to win the popular favour by
                    restoring, the government of the <hi rend="italic">bander esi\</hi> but
                    Ladislaus marched into Rome in June 1408 and established a senator of his own.
                    Meanwhile the two popes were continuing their shameful struggle, and the council
                    of Pisa (March 1409), in attempting to check it, only succeeded in raising up a
                    third pontiff, first in the person of Alexander V. (1409-10), and then in the
                    turbulent Baldassarc Cossa, who assumed the name of John XXIII. The latter began
                    by sending a large contingent to assist Louis of Anjou against Ladislaus. But
                    the enterprise failed, and, seeing himself deserted by all, Pope John next
                    embraced the cause of his foe by naming him gonfalonier of the church. Thereupon
                    Ladislaus concluded a sham peace, and then, seizing Rome, put it to the sack and
                    established his own government there. Thus John, like the other two popes,</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0682" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0729.jp2"/>
               <p>became a wanderer in Italy. In August 1414 Ladislaus died, and was succeeded by
                    the scandalous Queen Joanna II. The Roman people promptly expelled the
                    Neapolitans, and Cardinal Isolani, John’s legate, succeeding in rousing a
                    reaction in favour of the church, constituted a government of thirteen “
                    conservators” on the 19th of October.</p>               <p>In November 1414 the council of Constance assembled, and at last ended the
                    schism by deposing all the popes and incarcerating John XXIII., the most
                    turbulent of the three. On the nth of November 1417 Oddo Colonna was unanimously
                    elected to the papal chair; he was consecrated in the cathedral on the 27th as
                    Pope Martin V., and, being acknowledged by all, hastened without delay to take
                    possession of his see. Meanwhile disorder was at its height in Rome. The
                    cardinal legate Isolani governed as he best could, while the castle of St Angelo
                    remained in the hands of the Neapolitans, who still had a party in the city. In
                    this divided state of affairs, Braccio, a daring captain of adventurers,
                    nicknamed Fortebraccio, was inspired with the idea of making himself master of
                    Rome. Overcoming the feeble resistance opposed to him, he succeeded in this on
                    the 16th of June 1416, and assumed the title of “ Defensor Urbis.” But Joanna of
                    Naples despatched Sforza, an equally valiant captain, against him, and, without
                    offering battle, Fortebraccio withdrew on the 26th of August, after having been
                    absolute master of the Eternal City for seventy days. Sforza marched in on the
                    27th and took possession of the city in the name of Joanna. Martin V. instantly
                    proved himself a good statesman. He confirmed the legate Isolani as his vicar
                    and Giovanni Savelli as senator. Leaving Constance on the 16th of May 1418, he
                    reached Milan on the 12th of October, and slowly proceeded on his journey. While
                    in Florence he despatched his brother and nephew to Naples to make alliance with
                    Joanna, and caused her to be crowned on the 28th of October 1419 by his legate
                    Morosini. Upon this she promised to give up Rome to the pope. Her general,
                    Sforza, then entered the service of Martin V., and compelled Fortebraccio, who
                    was lingering in a threatening attitude at Perugia, to make peace with the pope.
                    The latter entrusted Fortebraccio with the conduct of the campaign against
                    Bologna, and that city was reduced to submission on the 15th of July 1420. The
                    Romans had already yielded to Martin’s brother the legate, and now earnestly
                    besought the arrival of their pope. Accordingly, he left Florence on the 19th of
                    September 1420, and entered the Vatican on the 28th. Rome was in ruins; nobility
                    and burghers were equally disorganized, the people unable to bear arms and
                    careless of their rights, while the battered walls of the Capitol</p>               <p>recorded the fall of two republics.</p>               <p>Martin V. had now to fulfil a far more difficult task than that of taking
                    possession of Rome. Throughout Italy municipal freedom was overthrown, and the
                    Roman Republic had ceased to exist. The Middle Ages were ended; the Renaissance
                    was beginning. The universal unity both of church and of empire was dissolved;
                    the empire was now’ Germanic, and derived its principal strength from direct
                    dominion over a few provinces. Independent and national states were already
                    formed or forming on all sides. The papacy itself had ceased to claim universal
                    supremacy over the world’s governments, and the possession of a temporal state
                    had become essential to its existence. In fact, Martin V. was the first of the
                    series of popes who were real sovereigns, and more occupied with politics than
                    religion. Involved in all the foreign intrigues, falsehoods and treacheries of
                    Italian diplomacy in the 15th century, their internal policy was imbued with all
                    the arts practised by the tyrants of the Renaissance, and nepotism became
                    necessarily the basis of their strength. It was natural that men suddenly
                    elected sovereigns of a new country where they had no ties, and of which they
                    had often no knowledge, should seek to strengthen their position by aggrandizing
                    so-called nephews who were not unfrequently</p>               <p>their sons.</p>               <p>Martin V. reduced the remains of the free Roman government to a mere civil
                    municipality. Following the method of the other despots of Italy, the old
                    republican institutions were allowed to retain their names and forms, their
                    administrative and some of their judicial attributes, while all their political
                    functions were transferred to the new government. Order was re-established, and
                    justice rigidly observed.</p>               <p>Many rebellious places were subdued by the sword, and many leaders of armed
                    bands were hanged. The pope, however, was forced to lean on his kinsmen the
                    Colonna and again raise them to power by grants of vast fiefs both in his own
                    state and the Neapolitan territory. And, after first supporting Joanna II., who
                    had assisted his entry into Rome, he next sided with her adversary, Louis of
                    Anjou, and then with Alphonso of Aragon, the conqueror of both and the constant
                    friend of the pope, who at last felt safe on his throne. Rome now enjoyed order,
                    peace and security, but had lost all hope of liberty. And when Martin died (20th
                    February 1431) these words were inscribed on his tomb, “ Temporum suorum
                    felicitas. ”</p>               <p>Eugenius IV. (1431-47) leant on the Orsini, and was fiercely opposed by the
                    Colonna, who excited the people against him. Accordingly on the 29th of May T434
                    the Romans rose in revolt to the old cry of “ Popolo e popolo, ” and again
                    constituted the rule of the seven governors of liberty. The pope fled by boat
                    down the Tiber, and, being pursued with stones and shots, narrowly escaped with
                    his life. On reaching Florence, he turned his energies to the recovery of the
                    state. It was necessary to quell the people; but, first of all, the Colonna and
                    the clan of the prefects of Vico, with their renewed princely power, had to be
                    overthrown. The Orsini were still his friends. Eugenius entrusted the campaign
                    to Patriarch (afterwards Cardinal) Vitelleschi, a worthy successor of Albomoz,
                    and of greater ferocity if less talent. This leader marched his army towards
                    Rome, and, instantly attacking Giovanni, prefect of Vico, captured and beheaded
                    him. The family was now extinguished; and its possessions reverting to the
                    church, the greater part of them were sold or given to Count Everso
                    d’Anguillara, of the house of Orsini. The prefecture, now little more than an
                    honorary title, was bestowed at will by the popes. Eugenius gave it to
                    Francesco,’founder of the powerful line of the Gravina-Orsini. Thus one noble
                    family was raised to greatness w <hi rend="underline">hil</hi> e another
                    perished by the sword. Vitelleschi had already begun to persecute the Colonna
                    and the Savelli, and committed terrible slaughter among them. Many castles were
                    demolished, many towns destroyed; and their inhabitants, driven to wander
                    famine-stricken over the Campagna, had to sell themselves as slaves for the sake
                    of bread. Finally the arrogant patriarch marched into Rome, as into a conquered
                    city, at the head of his men, and the Romans crouched at his feet. The pope now
                    began to distrust him, and sent Scarampo, another prelate of the same stamp, to
                    take his place. This new commander soon arrived, and, perceiving that
                    Vitelleschi proposed to resist, had him surrounded by his soldiers, who were
                    obliged to use force to compel his surrender.</p>               <p>Vitelleschi was carried bleeding to the castle of St Angelo, where he soon
                    afterwards died. The pope at last returned to Rome in 1443, and remained there
                    quietly till his death in 1447.</p>               <p>His successor Nicholas V. (1447-55) was a scholar solely devoted to the
                    patronage of <hi rend="italic">literati</hi> and artists. During his reign there
                    was a fresh attempt to restore the republic, but it was rather prompted by
                    literary and classical enthusiasm than by any genuine patriotic ardour.
                    Political passions and interests had ceased to exist. The conspiracy was headed
                    by Stefano Porcari, a man of the people, who claimed to be descended from Cato.
                    He had once been captain of the people in Florence, and was made podestà of
                    Bologna by Eugenius ' IV. He was a caricature of Cola di Rienzi, and
                    extravagantly proud of his</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0683" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0730.jp2"/>
               <p>Latin speeches in honour of ancient republican liberty. The, admiration of
                    antiquity was then at its height, and Porcari found many enthusiastic hearers.
                    Directly after the death of Eugenius IV. he made a first and unsuccessful
                    attempt to pro-claim the republic. Nevertheless Nicholas V., with the same
                    indulgence for scholars that had prompted him to pardon Valla for denying the
                    temporal power of the papacy and laughing to scorn the pretended donation of
                    Constantine, freely pardoned Porcari and named him podestà of Ariagni. He filled
                    this office with credit, but on his return to Rome again began to play the
                    agitator, and was banished to Bologna with a pension from the pope. Nicholas V.
                    had conferred all the state offices upon priests and abbots, and had erected
                    numerous fortresses. Hence there were many malcontents in Rome, in communication
                    with Porcari at Bologna, and ready to join in his plot. Arms were collected, and
                    on the day fixed he presented himself to his fellow-conspirators adorned with
                    rich robes and a gold chain, and harangued them in Latin on the duty of freeing
                    their country from the yoke of the priests. His design was to set fire to the
                    Vatican on the 6th of January 1453, the feast of the Epiphany; he and his
                    followers were to seize the pope, the cardinals and the castle of St Angelo. But
                    Nicholas received timely warning; the conspirators’ house was surrounded; and
                    Porcari himself was seized while trying to escape, confined in the castle of St
                    Angelo, and put to death with nine of his companions on the 9th of January.
                    Others shortly suffered the same fate.</p>               <p>Under Calixtus III. and Pius II. affairs went on quietly enough, but Paul II.
                    (1464-71) had a somewhat troubled reign. Yet he was a skilled politician. He
                    re-ordered the finances and the courts of justice, punished crime with severity,
                    was an energetic foe to the Malatesta of Rimini, put an end to the oppression
                    exercised in Rome by the wealthy and arrogant house of Anguillara, and kept the
                    people in good humour with continual festivities. But—and this was a grave
                    defect at that period—he extended no favour to learning, and, by driving many
                    scholars from the curia to make room for his own kinsmen, brought a storm about
                    his ears. At that time the house of Pomponio Leto was the rendezvous of learned
                    men and the seat of the Roman Academy. Leto was an enthusiast of antiquity; and,
                    as the members of the Academy all assumed old Latin names, they were suspected
                    of a design to re-establish paganism and the republican government. It is
                    certain that they all inveighed against the pope; and, as the latter was no man
                    of half measures, during the carnival of 1468 he suddenly imprisoned twenty
                    Academicians, and even subjected a few of them to torture. Pomponio Leto,
                    although absent in Venice, was also arrested and tried; but he exculpated
                    himself, craved forgiveness, and was set at liberty. His friends were also
                    released, for the charge of conspiracy proved to be unfounded. Certain members
                    of the Academy, and notably Platina in his <hi rend="italic">Lives of the
                        Popes,</hi> afterwards revenged themselves by stigmatizing Paul II. as the
                    persecutor of philosophy and letters. But he was no more a persecutor than a
                    patron of learning; he was a politician, the author of some useful reforms, and
                    solely intent on the • consolidation of his absolute power. Among his reforms
                    may be classed the revision of the Roman statutes in 1469, for the purpose of
                    destroying the substance while preserving the form of the old Roman legislation,
                    and entirely stripping it of all political significance. In fact the pope’s will
                    was now absolute, and even in criminal cases he could trample unhindered</p>               <p>on the common law.</p>               <p>There was still a senator of Rome, whose nomination was entirely in the hands of
                    the pope, still three conservators, the heads of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >rioni,</hi> and an elected council of twenty-six citizens. Now and then
                    also a shadowy semblance of a popular assembly was held to cast dust in the eyes
                    of the public, but even this was not for long. All these officials, together
                    with the judges of the Capitol, retained various attributes of different kinds.
                    They administered justice and gave sentence. There were numerous tribunals all
                    with undefined modes of procedure, so that it was very difficult for the
                    citizens to ascertain in which court justice should be sought. But in last
                    resort there was always the supreme decision of the pope. Thus matters remained
                    to the time of the French Revolution.</p>               <p>For the completion of this system a final blow had to be dealt to the
                    aristocracy, whose power had been increased by nepotism; and it was dealt by
                    bloodshed under the three following popes— Sixtus IV. (1471-84), Innocent VIII.
                    (1484-92) and Alexander VI. (1492-1503)—each of whom was worse than his
                    predecessor. The first, by means of his nephews, continued the slaughter of the
                    Colonna, sending an army against them, devastating their estates at Marino, and
                    beheading the protonotary Lorenzo Colonna. Innocent VIII. was confronted by the
                    power of the Orsini, who so greatly endangered his life by their disturbances in
                    the city that he was only saved by an alliance with Naples. Neither peace nor
                    order could be lastingly established until these arrogant barons were
                    overthrown. This task was accomplished by the worst of the three pontiffs,
                    Alexander VI. All know how the massacre of the Orsini was compassed, almost
                    simultaneously, by the pope in Rome and his equally iniquitous son, Caesar
                    Borgia, at Sinigaglia (1502). This pair dealt the last blow to the Roman
                    aristocracy and the tyrants of Romagna, and thus the temporal dominion of the
                    papacy was finally assured. The republic was now at an end; it had shrivelled to
                    a civil municipality. Its institutions, deprived of all practical value,
                    lingered on like ghosts of the past, subject from century to century to
                    unimportant changes. The history of Rome is henceforth absorbed in that of the
                    papacy. *</p>               <p>Nevertheless the republic twice attempted to rise from its grave, and on the
                    second occasion gave proofs of heroism worthy of its most glorious past. It was
                    first resuscitated in February 1798, by the influence of the French Revolution,
                    and the French constitution of the year III. was rapidly imitated. Rome had
                    again two councils—the tribunate and the senate, with five consuls constituting
                    the executive power. But in the following year, owing to the military reverses
                    of the French, the government of the popes was restored until 1809, when
                    Napoleon I. annexed to his empire the States of the Church. Rome was then
                    governed by a <hi rend="italic">consulta straordinaria</hi> —a special
                    commission— with the municipal and provincial institutions of France. In 1814
                    the papal government was again reinstated, and the old institutions, somewhat
                    modified on the French system, were recalled to life. Tius IX. (1846-77) tried
                    to introduce political reforms, and to improve and simplify the old machineiy of
                    state; but the advancing tide of the Italian revolution of 1848 drove him from
                    Rome; the republic was once more proclaimed, and had a brief but glorious
                    existence. Its programme was dictated by Giuseppe Mazzini, who with Saffi and
                    Armellini formed the triumvirate at the head of the government. United Italy was
                    to be a republic with Rome for her capital. The rhetorical idea of Cola di
                    Rienzi became heroic in 1849. The constituent assembly (9th February 1849)
                    proclaimed the fall of the temporal power of the popes, and the establishment of
                    a republic which was to be not only of Rome but of all Italy. France, although
                    then herself a republic, assumed the unenviable task of re-establishing the
                    temporal power by force of arms. But the gallant defence of Rome by Garibaldi
                    covered the republic with glory. The enemy was repulsed, and the army of the
                    Neapolitan king, sent to restore the pope, was also driven off. Then, however,
                    France despatched a fresh and more powerful force; Rome was vigorously besieged,
                    and at last compelled to surrender. On the 2nd of July 1849 the heroic general
                    departed from the city with some thousands of his followers. Almost at the same
                    time the constituent assembly proclaimed in the Capitol the constitution of the
                    Roman Republic. Immediately afterwards the French restored the government of
                    Pius IX., whose reign down to 1870 was that of an absolute sovereign. Then the
                    Italian government entered Rome (20th September 1870), proclaimed the national
                    constitution (9th October 1870), and the Eternal City became the capital of
                    Italy. Thus the</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0684" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0731.jp2"/>
               <p>scheme of national unity, the natural outcome of the history of Rome and of
                    Italy, impossible of accomplishment under the rule of the popes, was finally
                    achieved by the monarchy of Savoy, which, as the representative and
                    personification of Italian interests, abolished the temporal power of the papacy
                    and made Rome the seat of government of the united country (see <hi
