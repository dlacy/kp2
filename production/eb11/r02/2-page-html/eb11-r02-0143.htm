<p><span class="font1">objection being taken to the execution of such commissions by persons who in that employment were officers of courts foreign&nbsp;to the countries in which they acted, besides which those commissions could give no power to compel the attendance of&nbsp;witnesses abroad. Consequently both in the mother country&nbsp;and in the United States acts have been passed empowering&nbsp;the courts to issue commissions for taking evidence to colonial or&nbsp;foreign courts, and to execute such commissions when received&nbsp;by them from the courts of the colonies or of foreign countries.&nbsp;The British statutes are 13 Geo. III. c. 63; 1 Will. IV.&nbsp;c. 22; 3 &amp; 4 Vict. c. 105, 6 &amp; 7 Vict. c. 82, 22 Vict. c. 20 and&nbsp;49 &amp; 49 Vict. c. 74. But neither in England nor in thc United&nbsp;States have commissions of the old kind been entirely disused.&nbsp;In the practice under the Anglo-American statutes, the leading&nbsp;rules are that all the acts of the judge whose services are&nbsp;required, and all things done before him, are governed by the&nbsp;law of the country in which the execution takes place </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(locus&nbsp;regit actum),</span><span class="font1"> while the admissibility of the evidence and all else&nbsp;which concerns the conduct of the action is governed by the&nbsp;law of the country in which it is pending </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(lex fori).</span><span class="font1"> Details&nbsp;may be seen for England and the United States in the usual&nbsp;books of practice, and in Wharton’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Conflict of Laws</span><span class="font1"> (2nd ed.,&nbsp;1881), §§ 722-31, and Sir R.

In ecclesiastical law, letters of request&nbsp;are issued for the purpose of sending causes from one court to&nbsp;another. Where a diocesan court within a province has jurisdiction over the parties concerned, the plaintiff may apply to&nbsp;the judge of such court for letters of request, in order that the&nbsp;cause may be instituted either in the court of arches or the&nbsp;chancery court of York, as the case may be. When the judge&nbsp;of the diocesan court consents to sign such Iettcrs and they have&nbsp;been accepted by the judge of the higher court, a decree issues&nbsp;under his seal, calling upon the defendant to answer to the&nbsp;plaintiff in the suit instituted against him. Letters of request&nbsp;are also issued for other purposes, being sometimes sent from&nbsp;one judge to another to request him to examine witnesses who&nbsp;are out of tbe jurisdiction of the former, but in that of the&nbsp;latter; to enforce a monition, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REQUESTS, COURT OF, a minor court of the king’s council in England, under the presidency of the lord keeper of the&nbsp;privy seal. Its possible origin has been assigned to an order&nbsp;in council of 1390 directing the lords of the council to form a&nbsp;committee to examine the petitions of the humble people. Its&nbsp;jurisdiction was chiefly equitable, and owing to the small expenses&nbsp;of procedure it grew in popularity, especially for cases not of&nbsp;sufficient importance to bring into the court of chancery itself.&nbsp;Under Wolsey the court was fixed permanently at Whitehall.&nbsp;The judges of the court were styled masters of requests. In&nbsp;the reign of Queen Elizabeth there were two masters ordinary&nbsp;and two masters extraordinary. In James I.’s reign there were&nbsp;four masters ordinary. In Henry VIII.’s reign the judges of&nbsp;the court had ceased to be privy councillors, and towards the&nbsp;end of Elizabeth’s reign the court incurred the hostility of the&nbsp;common law courts, as having neither a statutory nor prescriptive&nbsp;title to jurisdiction. Notwithstanding a decision in 1598 as&nbsp;to the illegality of its jurisdiction, and subsequent decisions&nbsp;to the same effect in the reigns of James I. and Charles I., it&nbsp;continued to flourish until the suppression of the Star Chamber&nbsp;in 1640 virtually put an end to it. Although it sat until 1642,&nbsp;and masters of requests were appointed even after the Restoration, it ceased to exercise judicial functions. There were also&nbsp;courts of requests or, as they were sometimes called, courts of&nbsp;conscience, established in London in the reign of Henry VIII.&nbsp;with jurisdiction in matters of debt under forty shillings. These&nbsp;courts were extended in the reigns of George I. and George II.&nbsp;to various places in England, but they were abolished by an&nbsp;act of 1846 (County Courts Act), which established in their&nbsp;place the tribunal of tbe county court </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REQUIEM, the name of a solemn mass for the dead </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Missa pro defunctis)</span><span class="font1"> in the Roman Church, appointed to be sung on</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All Souls’ Day, in memory of all “ faithful departed,” at funeral services, and at the anniversaries of the death of particular&nbsp;persons. The name is taken from the first words of the Introit,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine.</span><span class="font1"> The term is specially&nbsp;applied to the musical setting of the mass. Thc most celebrated&nbsp;Requiem Masses are thosc of Palestrina, Mozart and Cherubini.&nbsp;The word has been also used of memorial services held in honour&nbsp;of a deceased person in churches other than the Roman.</span></p>

In&nbsp;small churches the reredos is usually replaced by a hanging or&nbsp;parament behind the altar, known as a dossal or dorsal. (See&nbsp;also </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Altar.)</span><span class="font1"> For the legality of images on reredoses in the&nbsp;Chureh of England, see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Image.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RESCHEN SCHEIDECK. This Alpine pass is in some sort the pendant of the Brenner Pass, but leads from the upper valley&nbsp;of the Inn or Engadine to the upper valley of. the Adige. It&nbsp;is but 4902 ft. in height. Near the summit * is the hamlet&nbsp;of Reschen, while some way below is the former hospice of&nbsp;St Valentin auf der Haid, mentioned as early as 1140. Starting from Landeck, the carriage road runs up the Inn valley to&nbsp;Pfunds, whence it mounts above the gorge of Finstermtinz to&nbsp;the village of Nauders (27} m.) where the road from the Swiss&nbsp;Engadine falls in (53j m. from St Moritz). Thence the road&nbsp;mounts gently to the pass, and then descends, with the infant&nbsp;Adige, to Mals (15J m.), whence the pass is sometimes wrongly&nbsp;named Malserheide. The road now descends the upper Adige&nbsp;valley, or Vintschgau, past Meran (37J m.) to Botzen (20 m. from&nbsp;Meran, or 100 m, from Landeck) where the Brenner route is&nbsp;joined.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(W.

To constitute the legal offence of rescue,&nbsp;the person rescued must be in the custody of a constable or&nbsp;private individual, but in the latter case the rescuer must know&nbsp;that the prisoner is in lawful custody. The punishment for&nbsp;the offence is fine and imprisonment, wdth or without hard&nbsp;labour, if the party rescued has not been convicted of the offence&nbsp;for which-he was in custody. But if the prisoner has been&nbsp;imprisoned on a charge of, or under sentence for, high treason,&nbsp;felony or misdemeanour, the rescue is high treason, felony or&nbsp;misdemeanour. The punishment for a felonious rescue may be&nbsp;penal servitude for not more than seven or less than three years,&nbsp;or imprisonment for not more than two years, with or without&nbsp;hard labour. The forcible rescue of goods legally distrained or&nbsp;the rescuing of cattle by pound breach are misdemeanours&nbsp;indictable at common law, but the more usual procedure is a&nbsp;civil action under 2 W. &amp; M. c. 5, s. 3 (1690), which makes an&nbsp;offender liable for treble damages.</span></p>
