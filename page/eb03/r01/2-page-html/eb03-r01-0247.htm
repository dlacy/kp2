<p><span class="font1">againſt the walls ſtones of 150 pounds weight. The towers, being thus furiouſly battered night and day,&nbsp;began to totter, and ſeveral breaches were opened in&nbsp;the walls : but the Rhodians, unexpectedly ſallying&nbsp;out, drove the enemy from their poſt, overturned their&nbsp;machines, and made a moſt dreadful havock ; inſomuch&nbsp;that ſome of them retired on board their veſſels, and&nbsp;were with much ado prevailed upon to come aſhore&nbsp;again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Demetrius now ordered a ſcalade by ſea and land at the ſame time ; and ſo employed the beſieged, that&nbsp;they were at a loſs what place they ſhould chiefly de-fend. The attack was carried on with the utmoſt fury&nbsp;on</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1">all ſides, and the beſieged defended themſelves with&nbsp;the greateſt intrepidity. Such of the enemy as advan-ced firſt were thrown down from the ladders, and mi-ſerably bruiſed. Several of the chief officers, having&nbsp;mounted the walls to encourage the ſoldiers by their&nbsp;example, were there either killed or taken priſon-ers. After the combat had laſted many hours, with&nbsp;great ſlaughter on both ſides, Demetrius, notwith-ſtanding all his valour, thought it neceſſary to retire,&nbsp;in order to repair his engines, and give his men ſome&nbsp;days reft,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Demetrius being ſenſible that he could not reduce the city till he was maſter of the port, after having&nbsp;refreſhed his men, he returned with new vigour againſt&nbsp;the fortifications which defended the entry into the&nbsp;harbour, when he came within the caſt of a dart, he&nbsp;cauſed a vaſt quantity of burning torches and firebrands&nbsp;to be thrown into the Rhodian ſhips, which were riding&nbsp;there ; and at the fame time galled, with dreadful&nbsp;ſhowers of darts, arrows, and ſtones, ſuch as offered&nbsp;to extinguiſh the flames. However, in ſpite of their&nbsp;utmoſt efforts, the -Rhodians put a ſtop to the fire ;&nbsp;and, having with great expedition manned three of&nbsp;their ſtrongeſt ſhips, drove with ſuch violence againſt&nbsp;the veſſels on which the enemy’s machines were planted,&nbsp;that they were ſhattered in pieces, and the engines&nbsp;diſmounted and thrown into the ſea. Exceſtus the&nbsp;Rhodian admiral, being encouraged by this ſuccefs,&nbsp;attacked the enemy’s fleet with his three ſhips, and&nbsp;ſunk a great many veſſels ; but was himſelf at laſt taken&nbsp;priſoner : the other two veſſels made their eſcape, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">regained the port.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As unfortunate as this laſt attack had proved to De-metrius, he determined to undertake another ; and, in order to ſucceed in his attempt, he ordered a machine of a new invention to be built, which was thrice&nbsp;the height and breadth of thoſe he had lately loſt.&nbsp;when the work was finiſhed, he cauſed the engine to&nbsp;be placed near the port, which he was reſolved, at all&nbsp;adventures, to force. But as it was upon the point&nbsp;of entering the harbour, a dreadful ſtorm ariſing, drove&nbsp;it againſt the ſhore, with the veſſels on which it had&nbsp;been reared. The beſieged, who were attentive to improve all favourable conjunctures, while the tempeſt&nbsp;was ſtill raging, made a ſally againſt thoſe who defended the eminence mentioned above ; and, though&nbsp;repulſed ſeveral times, carried it at laſt, obliging the&nbsp;Demetrians, to the number of 400, to throw down&nbsp;their arms and ſubmit. After this victory gained by&nbsp;the Rhodians, there arrived to their aid 150 Gnoſ-ſians, and 500 men fent by Ptolemy from Egypt, moſt&nbsp;of them being natives of Rhodes</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font1">who had ſerved</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">among the king’s troops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Demetrius being extremely mortified to</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1">ſee all his batteries againſt the harbour rendered ineffectual, re-ſolved to employ them by land, in hopes of carrying&nbsp;the city by aſſault, or at leaſt reducing it to the neceſſity of capitulating, with this view, having got&nbsp;together a</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1">vaſt quantity of timber and other materials, he framed the famous engine called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">helepolis,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">which was by many degrees larger than any that, had&nbsp;ever been invented before. Tts baſis was fquare, each&nbsp;ſide being in length near 50 cubits, and made up of&nbsp;ſquare pieces of timber, bound together with plates of&nbsp;iron. In the middle part he placed thick planks, about&nbsp;a cubit diſtance from each other ; and on theſe the&nbsp;men were to ſtand who forced the engine forward.&nbsp;The whole was moved upon eight ſtrong and large&nbsp;wheels, whoſe felloes were ſtrengthened with ſtrong&nbsp;iron plates. In order to facilitate and vary the move-ments of the helepolis, caſters were placed under it,&nbsp;whereby it was turned in an inſtant to what ſide the&nbsp;workmen and engineers pleaſed. From each of the&nbsp;four angles a large pillar of wood was carried to about&nbsp;the height of 100 cubits, and inclining to each other;&nbsp;the whole machine conſiſting of nine ſtories, whoſe&nbsp;dimenſions gradually leſſened in the aſcent. The firſt&nbsp;ſtory was ſupported by 43 beams, and the laſt by no&nbsp;more than nine. Three ſides of the machine were&nbsp;plated over with iron, to prevent its being damaged by&nbsp;the fire that might be thrown from the city. In the&nbsp;front of each ſtory were windows of the ſame ſize and&nbsp;ſhape as the engines that were to be diſcharged from&nbsp;thence. To each window were ſhutters, to draw up&nbsp;for the defence of thoſe who managed the machines,&nbsp;and to deaden the force of the ſtones thrown by the&nbsp;enemy, the ſhutters being covered with ſkins ſtuffed&nbsp;with wool. Every ſtory was furniſhed with two large&nbsp;ſtaircaſes, that whatever was neceſſary might be brought&nbsp;up by one, while others were going down by the other,&nbsp;and ſo every thing may be diſpatched without tumult&nbsp;or confuſion. This huge machine was moved forwards&nbsp;by 3000 of the ſtrongeſt men of the whole army ; but&nbsp;the art with which it was built greatly facilitated the&nbsp;motion. Demetrius cauſed likewiſe to be made ſeveral teſtudoes or pent houſes, to cover his men while&nbsp;they advanced to ſill up the trenches and ditches ; and&nbsp;invented a new ſort of galleries, through which thoſe&nbsp;who were employed at the ſiege might paſs and re-paſs at their pleaſure, without the leaſt danger. He&nbsp;employed all his ſeamen in levelling the ground over&nbsp;which the machines were to be brought up, to the&nbsp;ſpace of four furlongs. The number of workmen who&nbsp;were employed on this occaſion amounted to 30,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the mean time, the Rhodians, obſerving theſe formidable preparations, were buſy in raiſing a new&nbsp;wall within that which the enemy intended to batter&nbsp;with the helepolis. In order to accompliſh this work,&nbsp;they pulled down the wall which ſurrounded the theatre,&nbsp;ſome neighbouring houſes, and even ſome temples, after having ſolemnly promiſed to build more magnifi-cent ſtructures in honour of the gods, if the city were&nbsp;preſerved. At the ſame time, they ſent out nine of&nbsp;their beſt ſhips to ſeize ſuch of the enemy’s veſſels as&nbsp;they could meet with, and thereby diſtreſs</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1">them for</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
