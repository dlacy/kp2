It would be unhappy, indeed, if, on a compariſon of pure theiſm with polytheiftn, the latter, with all its abſurdities, ſhould be found more beneficial to mankind than the former. Tbe theiſm of the Jews was not formed to be diffeminated through the earth ; that would have been inconſiſtent with the purpofes for which it is ſaid to have been deſigned. But while the Jews were ſeparated by their religion from all other nations, and perhaps, in ſome degree, fixed and rendered ſtationary in their progreſs towards reſine-ment, they were placed in circumſtances, in reſpect to laws, and government, and religion, and moral light, which might with good reaſon render them the envy of every other nation in the ancient world.</p><p>IV. The Chriſtian religion next demands our attention. It is to be conſidered as an improvement of the Jewiſh, or a new ſuperſtructure raiſed on the ſame baſis. If the effects of the Jewiftt religion were beneficial to thoſe among whom it was eſtabliſhed, they were confined almoſt to them alone. But is the ſpirit of Chriſtianity equally pure and benignant ? Is its influence equally beneficial and more diffuſtve than that of Judaiſm ? Does it really merit to have triumphed over both the theiſm of the Jews and the polytheiſin of the heathens ?</p><p>If we conſider the doctrines and precepts of the Chriſtian religion, nothing can be more happily calculated to raife the dignity of human nature, and promote the happineſs of mankind. The happineſs of the individual is beſt promoted by the exerciſe of love and gratitude towards God, and relignation to his providence ; of humanity, integrity, and good will towards men ; and by the due government βf our appetites and paſſions. Social happineſs again proceeds from the members of ſociety entertaining a diſintereſted regard for the public welfare ; being actively indαftrious each in his proper ſphere of exertion ; and being ſtrictly juſt and faithful, and generouſiy benevolent in their mutual intercourfe. The tenor of the goſpel inculcates theſe virtues ; it feems everywhere through the whole of the Chriſtian code to have been the great deſign of its Author to in-ſpire mankind with mild, benevolent, and peaceable dif-poſitions, and to form them to courteous manners. Chriſtianity again repreſents the Deity and his ∙attri-butes in the faireſt light; even fo as to render our ideas of his nature, and the manner in which he exerts his power, conſiſtent with the moſt correct principles of morality that can be collected from all the other religions that have prevailed in the earth, and from the writings of the moſt admired philoſophers. The ritual obſervances which Chriſtianity enjoins are few in number, eafy to perform, decent, expreſſive, and edifying. It inculcates no duties but what are founded on thé principles of human nature, and on the relation in which men ſtand to God, their Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier ; and it preſcribes accurate rules for the regulation of the conduct. The aſſiſtance of the ſpirit of God is promiſed in this ſacred volume to thoſe who aſſiduouſly labour to difcharge the duties which it enjoins ; and it exhibits a ſtriking example of ſpotleſs pu-rity, which we may fafely venture to imitate. The goſpel teaches that worldly afflictions are incident to both good and bad men ; a doctrine highly conducive to virtue, which conſoles us in diſtreſs, prevents deſpair, ⅛n∙d encourages us to perſiſt ſirmlv in otιr integrity under every difficulty and trial. Chriſtianſty reprefents all men as children of the fame God, and heirs of the fame ſalvation, and levels all diſtinctions of rich and poor, as accidental and inſigniſicant in the ſight of him who rewards or puniſhes with impartiality according to the merits or demerits of his creatures. This doctrine is highly favourable to virtue, as it tends to humble the proud, and to communicate dignity of ſentiment to thc lowly ; to render princes and inferior magiſtrates mo-derate and juſt, gentle and condeſcending, to their inferiors. It farther requires huſhands to be affectionate and indulgent to their wives, wives to be faithful and reſpectful to their huſhands, and both to be true and conſtant to each other. Such is the purity of the gofpel, that it forbids us even to harbour impure thoughts; it requires us to abandon our vices, however dear to us ; and to the cautious wiſdom of the ſerpent it directs us to join the innocent ſimplicity of the dove. The Chriſtian diſpenſation, to prevent a perſeverance in immorality, offers pardon for the pail, provided the offender forfake his vicious practices, with a firm refolution to act differently in future. The fonctions of the goſpel have a natural tendency to exalt the mind above the paltry purſuits of this world, and to render the Chriſtian incorruptible by wealth, honours, or plea-ſures. The true Chriſtian not only abſtains from in-juſtice towards others, but even forgives thoſe injuries which he himſelf ſuffers, knowing that he cannot otherwiſe hope for forgiveneſs from God. Such are the precepts, ſuch the ſpirit, and ſuch the general tendency of the goſpel. Even thoſe who refuſed to give credit to its doctrines and hiſtory have yet acknowledged the excellence of its precepts. They have acknowledged, that " no religion ever yet appeared in the world of which the natural tendency was ſo much directed to promote the peace and happineſs of mankind as the Chriſtian ; and that the goſpel of Chriſt is one continued leffon of the ſtricteſt morality, of juſtice, benevolence, and univerfol charity.” Thefe are thertvords of Bolingbroke, one of its keeneſt and moſt inſidious op-ponents. without examining the effects of this religion on ſociety, we might almoſt venture to pronounce with confidence, that a religion, the precepts of which are ſo happily formed to promote all that is juſt and excellent, canηot but be in the higheſt degree beneficial to mankind. By reviewing the effects which it has actually produced, the favourable, opinion which we naturally conceive of it, after conſtdering its precepts, cannot but be confirmed.</p><p>Οηε circumftance we mtiſt take notice of as rather unfavourable to this review. It is really impoffible to do juſtice to Chriſtianity by fuch a diſcuffion of its merits. The virtues which it has a natural tendency to produce and cheriſh in the human heart, are not of a noiſy oſtentatious kind ; they often eſcape the Obſervation of the world. Temperance, gentleneſs, patience, benevolence, juſtice, and general purity of manners, are not the qualities which moſt readily attract the admiration and obtain the applaufe of men. The man of Roſs, whom Mr Pope has ſo juſtly celebrated, was a private character ; his name is nt w likely to live, and his virtues to be known to the lateſt poſterity : aud yet, however diſintereſted his virtues, however beneficial his influence to all around him, had his character not attracted thc notice of that eminent poet, his name</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
