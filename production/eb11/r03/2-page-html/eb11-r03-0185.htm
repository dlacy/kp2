<p><span class="font0">accuracy, and that familiarity with the commerce of the country, which distinguished his public career. In 1781 he married&nbsp;Manon Jeanne Phlipon (1754-1793), and the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Madame&nbsp;Roland</span><span class="font0"> is famous in history. She was the daughter of Gratien&nbsp;Phlipon, a Paris engraver, who was ambitious, speculative and&nbsp;nearly always poor. From her early years she showed great&nbsp;aptitude for study, an ardent and enthusiastic spirit, and unquestionable talent. She was to a considerable extent self-taught; and her love of reading made her acquainted first with&nbsp;PIutarch—a passion for which author she continued to cherish&nbsp;throughout her life—thereafter with Bossuet, Massillon, and&nbsp;authors of a like stamp, and finally with Montesquieu, Voltaire&nbsp;and Rousseau. These studies marked stages of her development,&nbsp;and as her mind matured she abandoned the idea of a convent&nbsp;which for a year or two she had entertained, and added to the&nbsp;enthusiasm for a republic which she had imbibed from her&nbsp;earlier studies not a little of the cynicism and the daring which&nbsp;the later authors inspired. She almost equalled her husband in&nbsp;knowledge, and infinitely excelled him in talent and in tact.&nbsp;Through and with him she exercised a singularly powerful influence over the destinies of France from the outbreak of the&nbsp;Revolution till her death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For four years after their marriage Roland lived at Amiens, he being still an inspector of manufactures; but his knowledge&nbsp;of commercial affairs enabled him to contribute articles to the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopédie Nouvelle,</span><span class="font0"> in which, as in all his literary work, he&nbsp;was assisted by his wife. On their removal to Lyons the influence of both became <sup>i</sup>Wider and more powerful. Iheir fervent&nbsp;political aspirations could not be concealed, and from the beginning of the Revolution they threw in their lot with the party&nbsp;of advance. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Courrier de Lyon</span><span class="font0"> contained articles the&nbsp;success of which reached even to the capital and attracted the&nbsp;attention of the Parisian press. They were from the pen of&nbsp;Madame Roland and were signed by her husband. A correspondence sprang up with Brissot and other friends of the&nbsp;Revolution at headquarters. In Lyons their views were publicly&nbsp;known ; Roland was elected a member of the municipality, and&nbsp;when the depression of trade in the south demanded representation in Paris he was deputed by the council of Lyons to ask the&nbsp;Constituent Assembly that the municipal debt of Lyons, which&nbsp;had been contracted for the benefit of the state, should be regarded as national debt. Accompanied by his wife, he appeared&nbsp;in the capital in February 1791. He remained there until&nbsp;September, frequenting the Society of the Friends of the Constitution, and entertaining deputies of the most advanced&nbsp;opinions, especially those who later became the leading Girondists. Madame Roland took an active part in the political&nbsp;discussions in these reunions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In September 1791, Roland’s mission being executed, they returned to Lyons. Meanwhile the inspectorships of manufactures had been abolished; he was thus free; and they&nbsp;could no longer remain absent from the centre of affairs. In&nbsp;December they again reached Paris. Roland became a&nbsp;member of the Jacobin Club. They had made many and&nbsp;influential friends in advance, and Madame Roland’s salon&nbsp;soon became the rendezvous of Brissot, Pétion, Robespierre&nbsp;and other leaders of the popular movement, above all of Buzot,&nbsp;whom she loved with platonic enthusiasm. In person Madame&nbsp;Roland was attractive though not beautiful; her ideas were&nbsp;clear and far-reaching, her manner calm, and her power of&nbsp;observation extremely acute. It was almost inevitable that&nbsp;she should find herself in the centre of political aspirations&nbsp;and presiding over a company of the most talented men of&nbsp;progress. The rupture had not yet been made evident between&nbsp;the Girondist party and that section still more extreme, that&nbsp;of the Mountain. For a time the whole left united in forcing&nbsp;the resignation of the ministers. When the crisis came the&nbsp;Girondists were ready, and on the 23rd of March 1792 Roland&nbsp;found himself appointed minister of the interior. As a&nbsp;minister of the crown Roland exhibited a bourgeois brusqueness&nbsp;of manner and a remarkable combination of political prejudice with administrative ability. While his wife’s influence&nbsp;could not increase the latter, it was successfully exerted to&nbsp;foment and embitter the former. He was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ex officio</span><span class="font0"> excluded&nbsp;from the Legislative Assembly, and his declarations of policy&nbsp;were thus in writing—that is, in the form in which she could&nbsp;most readily exert her power. A great occasion was invented.&nbsp;The decrees against the emigrants and the non-juring clergy&nbsp;still remained under the veto of the king. A letter was penned&nbsp;by Madame Roland and addressed by her husband to Louis.&nbsp;It remained unanswered. Thereupon, in full council and in&nbsp;the king’s presence, Roland read his letter aloud. It contained&nbsp;many and terrible truths as to the royal refusal to sanction&nbsp;the decrees and as to the king’s position in the state; but it&nbsp;was inconsistent with a minister’s position, disrespectful if&nbsp;not insolent in tone. Roland’s dismissal followed. Then he&nbsp;completed the plan: he read the letter to the Assembly; it&nbsp;was ordered to be printed, became the manifesto of disaffection,&nbsp;and was circulated everywhere. In the demand for the reinstatement of the dismissed ministers were found the means&nbsp;of humiliation, and the prelude to the dethronement, of the&nbsp;king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After the insurrection of the 10th of August, Roland was recalled to power, one of his colleagues being Danton. But&nbsp;now he was dismayed by the progress of the Revolution.&nbsp;He was above all a provincial, and was soon in opposition&nbsp;to the party of the Mountain, which aimed at supremacy not&nbsp;only in Paris but in the government as well. His hostility&nbsp;to the insurrectional commune of Paris, which led him to&nbsp;propose transferring the government to Blois,‘and his attacks&nbsp;upon Robespierre and his friends rendered him very unpopular.&nbsp;His neglect to seal the iron chest discovered in the Tuileries,&nbsp;which contained the proofs of Louis XVI.’s relations with the&nbsp;enemies of France, led to the accusation that he had destroyed&nbsp;a part of these documents. Finally, in the trial of the king&nbsp;he demanded, with the Girondists, that the sentence should&nbsp;be pronounced by a vote of the whole people, and not simply&nbsp;by the Convention. He resigned office on the 23rd of January&nbsp;!793» two days after the king’s execution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although now extremely unpopular, the Rolands remained in Paris, suffering abuse and calumny, especially from Marat.&nbsp;Once Madame Roland appeared personally in the Assembly&nbsp;to repel the falsehoods of an accuser, and her ease and dignity&nbsp;evoked enthusiasm and compelled acquittal. But violence&nbsp;succeeded violence, and early on the morning of the ist of&nbsp;June she was arrested and thrown into the prison of the&nbsp;Abbaye. Roland himself escaped secretly to shelter in Rouen.&nbsp;Released for an hour from the Äbbaye, she was again arrested&nbsp;and thrown among the horrors of Sainte-Pélagie. Finally,&nbsp;she was transferred to the Conciergerie. In prison she won&nbsp;the affections of the guards, and was allowed the privilege of&nbsp;writing materials and the occasional visits of devoted friends.&nbsp;She there wrote her </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Appel à V impartiale postérité,</span><span class="font0"> those memoirs&nbsp;which display a strange alternation between self-laudation and&nbsp;patriotism, between the trivial and the sublime. On the 8th&nbsp;of November 1793 she was conveyed to the guillotine. Before&nbsp;yielding her head to the block, she bowed before the clay&nbsp;statue of Liberty erected in the Place de la Révolution,&nbsp;uttering her famous apostrophe—“0 Liberty! what crimes&nbsp;are committed in thy name! ” When Roland heard of his&nbsp;wife’s condemnation, he wandered some miles from his refuge&nbsp;in Rouen; maddened by despair and grief, he wrote a few&nbsp;words expressive of his horror at those massacres which could&nbsp;only be inspired by the enemies of France, protesting that&nbsp;“ from the moment when I learned that they had murdered&nbsp;my wife I would no longer remain in a world stained with&nbsp;enemies.” He affixed the paper to his breast, and unsheathing&nbsp;a sword-stick fell upon the weapon, which pierced his heart,&nbsp;on the 10th of November 1793.</span></p>
