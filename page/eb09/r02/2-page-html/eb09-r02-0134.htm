<p><span class="font1">deposit their sediment in the bed of the river, instead of spreading it over the adjacent land, and thus gradually&nbsp;raise the river bed and consequently the height of the&nbsp;floods. The remedies for these defects are strong high&nbsp;banks made of the best materials, and a periodical cleansing of the river bed. Neglect of these precautions has&nbsp;led to serious disasters. Large tracts in the Fens have&nbsp;been occasionally flooded by the bursting or overtopping&nbsp;of badly constructed banks. Numerous breaches have&nbsp;occurred in the embankments of the Po, resulting in the&nbsp;devastation of its valley; and the flood level of the Po&nbsp;has been so much raised that it has been decided not to&nbsp;heighten the embankments for fear of occasioning still&nbsp;greater disasters. The gradual silting up of the river&nbsp;Theiss, near Szegedin, produced a rise in its flood level&nbsp;which led to the overtopping of the protecting embankment in 1879, and the formation of a breach; and the&nbsp;water thus set free destroyed a portion of Szegedin, and&nbsp;inundated a tract of 200 square miles. The rise of the&nbsp;bed of some rivers in Japan, from the deposit of silt, has&nbsp;been followed up by the gradual raising of the embankments; and this system has been carried out to such a&nbsp;degree, and the accumulated deposit is so great, that some&nbsp;of these embanked rivers have their beds as much as forty&nbsp;feet above the level of the plains over which they flow.&nbsp;These high embankments necessarily require constant&nbsp;attention ; and any failure is attended with serious inundations. They serve as a warning against the extensive&nbsp;raising of embankments to counteract the silting up of&nbsp;a river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(3) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pumping.—</span><span class="font1">When lands are very flat and low, lying sometimes actually below the general drainage level of the&nbsp;district and the waterlevel of the streams, it is impossible&nbsp;for rivers to perform their ordinary function of draining&nbsp;the land by gravitation. It is necessary in such cases to&nbsp;create an artificial fall by pumping the drainage waters up&nbsp;so as to be discharged into the adjacent streams. This&nbsp;method has the advantage of ensuring the effectual drainage of the lands, provided adequate pumping power is&nbsp;supplied ; but it forms an additional tax on the land, as&nbsp;steam has to be applied to do what is under ordinary conditions effected by nature, and the land has also to be&nbsp;surrounded by banks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This system has been adopted for the drainage of the Haarlem Meer reclamation, and also for the lands reclaimed from Lake Y in the construction of the Amsterdam ship canal. The drainage of the Fens is, in several&nbsp;instances, supplemented by pumping ; and a portion of&nbsp;the Witham basin has been secured against floods by this&nbsp;means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The formation of large reservoirs in river valleys has been proposed for storing the surplus waters till a flood&nbsp;has subsided. A reservoir has indeed been formed, by&nbsp;constructing a high masonry dam across a narrow gorge&nbsp;of the Furens valley, which both supplies the town of St&nbsp;Étienne with water and preserves it from inundation. It&nbsp;is also proposed to prevent the floods of the river Chagres&nbsp;from interfering with the Panama Canal, by impounding&nbsp;its flood waters in an extensive reservoir to be formed by&nbsp;building a high dam across a suitable point of its valley.&nbsp;In these cases, however, the deep valleys with their&nbsp;narrow gorges are peculiarly well adapted for the formation of reservoirs having a considerable capacity, whereas&nbsp;most river valleys are unsuitable for reservoirs, and the&nbsp;construction of the long lengths of the banks that would&nbsp;be required would entail a very large expenditure, so that&nbsp;this system could only have a very restricted application.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Improvements of the Upper Portions of Rivers.—</span><span class="font1">Most rivers are not suitable by nature for navigation in their&nbsp;non-tidal portion, or, in the case of tideless rivers, at&nbsp;a considerable distance from their mouths, as the fall of&nbsp;their bed increases towards their source, and they generally present irregularities in depth and flow, with occasional sharp bends. Even where the depth is adequate, an&nbsp;irregular or rapid flow offers a great obstacle to up-stream&nbsp;traffic. Moreover, the fall of the waterlevel in dry seasons&nbsp;would often make a river too shallow for navigation.&nbsp;Accordingly, whilst improving the worst bends and removing shoals, it is frequently necessary to retain the water,&nbsp;when the flow is small, so as to maintain a sufficient depth.&nbsp;This is accomplished by dividing the river into a series of&nbsp;sections or reaches, and pounding up the water at the end&nbsp;of each reach by means of a dam or weir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Formerly rivers used to be penned in by a series of stanches near shoal places, which held up the water, and,&nbsp;when several boats were collected in the pool above a&nbsp;stanch, it was suddenly opened, and the sudden rush of&nbsp;water floated the boats over the shallows below. This&nbsp;primitive method of navigation, termed flashing, was&nbsp;formerly practised on the Thames and the Severn, and&nbsp;also on some of the rapidly flowing rivers in France, such&nbsp;as the Yonne. The stanches on the Severn were removed&nbsp;in 1842; but a few still exist across the Thames above&nbsp;Oxford, where the barge navigation follows a lateral canal.&nbsp;These stanches, consisting of beams swung across the river&nbsp;and supporting a series of spars and paddles, were easily&nbsp;removed in flood time or for the passage of boats. The&nbsp;stanches on the Yonne, which were more recently erected,&nbsp;were of a more elaborate description, known as needle&nbsp;weirs, and are still retained as weirs for holding up the&nbsp;water, though the process of flashing has been discontinued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As the demands of navigation increased, these primitive methods proved inadequate, and, moreover, they were&nbsp;quite unsuited for up-stream traffic. Accordingly weirs&nbsp;were substituted for stanches, to hold up the water in&nbsp;each reach ; and locks were constructed, in suitable side&nbsp;channels, for enabling vessels to be passed from one reach&nbsp;to the next with little loss of water, and with equal facility&nbsp;either up or down. Rivers have been thus converted into&nbsp;still-water navigations, with level reaches forming a series&nbsp;of steps, having a fall at each lock, in place of the natural&nbsp;inclination of the river bed ; so that the up-river traffic is&nbsp;in a great measure relieved from the serious hindrance of&nbsp;an opposing current. In order that the water held back&nbsp;by the weir may be retained within the channel, it is&nbsp;necessary to raise the banks on each side for some distance&nbsp;above the weir ; and, as the gradual rise in the river bed&nbsp;towards the upper end of the reach reduces the depth, it&nbsp;is necessary to deepen the river along the upper portion of&nbsp;the reach to secure a uniform draught of water. A river&nbsp;is thus practically converted into a canal, with this sole&nbsp;difference that it has still to discharge the drainage waters&nbsp;of its basin. This primary object of rivers, to which&nbsp;indeed they owe their existence, was in many instances&nbsp;somewhat overlooked when rivers were utilized for navigation ; and weirs appear to have been often regarded merely&nbsp;as dams for retaining the water, rather than as regulators&nbsp;of its flow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Weirs.—Locks have been already considered in the article on Canals (g.vf ; so that it will suffice here to describe briefly the&nbsp;different forms of weirs, which are essentially river works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Weirs have been divided into three classes, namely, overfall weirs, draw-door weirs, and movable weirs.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Overfall Weirs.—An overfall weir is a solid barrier placed across a stream for the purpose of raising the waterlevel (Plate V. fig. 1@@<sup>2</sup>),&nbsp;and only affords an outlet for the discharge of the river when the&nbsp;water rises above its crest. The waterlevel of the river is thus permanently raised, not merely in dry seasons, but also in flood time,</span></p>
