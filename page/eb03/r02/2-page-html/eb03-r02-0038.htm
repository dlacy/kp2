<p><span class="font0">came bodies of ſound doctrine; and the deductions from their respective theories were found fair repreſentations of the phenomena of nature. Whenever a man&nbsp;has diſcovered a law of nature, he has laid the foundation of a ſcience, and he has given us a new mean of&nbsp;ſubjecting to our ſervice ſome element hitherto independent: and ſo long as groups of natural operations&nbsp;follow a route which appears to us whimſical, and will&nbsp;not admit our calculations, we may be aſſured that we&nbsp;are ignorant of the principle which connects them all,&nbsp;and regulates their procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This is remarkably the caſe with ſeveral phenomena in the motions of fluids, and particularly in the motion&nbsp;of water in a bed or conduit of any kind. Although&nbsp;the firſt geniuſes of Europe have for this century paſt&nbsp;turned much of their attention to this ſubject, we are&nbsp;almoſt ignorant of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">general laws</span><span class="font0"> which may be obſerved in their motions. We have been able to ſclect&nbsp;very few points of reſemblance, and every caſe remains&nbsp;nearly an individual. About 150 years ago we diſcovered, by experience only, the quantity and velocity of&nbsp;water iſſuing from a ſmall orifice, and, after much labour, have extended this to any orifice; and this is almoſt the whole of our confidential knowledge. But as&nbsp;to the uniform courſe of the ſtreams which water the&nbsp;face of the earth, and the maxims which will certainly&nbsp;negulate this agreeably to our wiſhes, we are in a manner totally ignorant. Who can pretend to ſay what is&nbsp;the velocity of a river of which you tell him the breadth,&nbsp;the depth, and the declivity? Who can ſay what ſwell&nbsp;will be produced in different parts of its courſe, if a dam&nbsp;or weir of given dimenſions be made in it, or a bridge&nbsp;be thrown acroſs it? or how much its waters will be&nbsp;raiſed by turning another ſtream into it, or ſunk by taking off a branch to drive a mill? Who can ſay with&nbsp;confidence what muſt be the dimenſions or ſlope of this&nbsp;branch, in order to furniſh the water that is wanted, or&nbsp;the dimenſions and ſlope of a canal which ſhall effectually drain a fenny diſtrict? Who can ſay what form&nbsp;will cauſe or will prevent the undermining of banks, he&nbsp;forming of elbows, the pooling of the bed, or the de-poſition of lands? Yet theſe are the moſt important&nbsp;queſtions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The cauſes of this ignorance are the want or uncertainty of our principles; the falſity of our only theory, which is belied by experience and the ſmall number of&nbsp;proper obſervations or experiments, and difficulty of making ſuch as ſhall be ſerviceable. We have, it is true, made a few experiments on the efflux of water ſrom&nbsp;ſmall orifices, and from them we have deduced a ſort of&nbsp;theory, dependant on the fall of heavy bodies and the&nbsp;laws of hydroſtatic preſſure. Hydroſtatics is indeed&nbsp;founded on very ſimple principles, which give a very&nbsp;good account of the laws of the quieſcent equilibrium&nbsp;of fluids, in conſequence of gravity and perfect fluidity. But by what train of reaſoning can we connect theſe&nbsp;with the phenomena of the uniform motion of the waters of a river or open ſtream, which can derive its motion only from the ſlope of its ſurface, and the modifications of this motion or its velocity only from the&nbsp;width and depth of the ſtream? Theſe are the only circumſtances which can diſtinguiſh a portion of a river&nbsp;from a veſſel of the ſame ſize and ſhape, in which, however, the water is at reſt. In both, gιavity is the ſole&nbsp;cauſe of preſſure and </span><span class="font1">motion; but there muſt be </span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">ome</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">circumſtance peculiar to running waters </span><span class="font1">which modifies </span><span class="font0">the exertions of this active principle, and which, when diſcovered, muſt be the baſis of hydraulics, and muſt&nbsp;oblige us to reject every theory founded on fancied hy-potheſes, and which can only lead to abſurd conclu-ſions: and ſurely abſurd conſequences, when legitimately&nbsp;drawn, are complete evidence of improper principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When it was diſcovered experimentally, that the velocities of water iſſuing from orifices at various depths under the ſurface were as the ſquare roots of thoſe&nbsp;depths, and the fact was verified by repeated experiments, this principle was immediately and without modification applied to every motion of water. Mariotte,&nbsp;Varignon, Guglielmini, made it the baſis of complete&nbsp;ſyſtems of hydraulics, which prevail to this day, after&nbsp;having received various amendments and modifications.&nbsp;The ſame reaſoning obtains through them all, though&nbsp;frequently obſcured by other circumſtances, which are&nbsp;more perſpicuouſly expreſſed by Guglielmini in his. Fundamental Theorems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He conſiders every point P (fig. 1. ) in a maſs of fluid as an orifice in the ſide of a veſſel, and conceives the particle as having a tendency to move with the&nbsp;ſame velocity with which it would iſſue from the orifice. Therefore, if a vertical line AFC be drawn thro*&nbsp;that point, and if this be made the axis of a parabolic&nbsp;ADE, of which A at the ſurface of the fluid is the&nbsp;vertex, and AB (four times the height through which&nbsp;a heavy body would fall in a ſecond) is the parameter,&nbsp;the velocity of this particle will be repreſented by the&nbsp;ordinate PD of this parabola; that is, PD is the ſpace&nbsp;which it would uniformly deſcribe in a ſecond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From this principle is derived the following theory of running waters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let DC (fig. 2. ) be the horizontal bottom of a reſervoir, to which is joined a ſloping channel CK of uniform breadth, and let AB be the ſurface of the ſtand-ing water in the reſervoir. Suppoſe the vertical plane BC pierced with an infinity of holes, through each of&nbsp;which the water iſſues. The velocity of each filament&nbsp;will be that which is acquired by falling from the ſur-face AB j∙. The filament C, iſſuing with this velocity, will then glide down the inclined plane like&nbsp;any other heavy body; and (by the common doctrine of&nbsp;the motion down an inclined plane ) when it has arrived&nbsp;at F, it will have the ſame velocity which it would&nbsp;have acquired by falling through the height OF, the&nbsp;point O being in the horizontal plane AB produced.&nbsp;The ſame may be ſaid of its velocity when it arrives at&nbsp;H or K. The filament immediately above C will alſo&nbsp;iſſue with a velocity which is in the ſubduplicate ratio&nbsp;of its depth, and will then glide down above the firſt&nbsp;filament. The ſame may be affirmed of all the filaments; and of the ſuperficial filament, which will occupy the ſurface of the deſcending ſtream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From this account of the geneſis of a running ſtream of water, we may fairly draw the following conſequences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The velocity of any particle R, in any part of&nbsp;the ſtream, is that acquired by falling from the horizontal plane AN.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The velocity at the bottom of the ſtream is everywhere greater than anywhere above it, and is leaſt of&nbsp;all at the ſurface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The velocity of the ſtream increaſes continually as&nbsp;the ſtream recedes from its ſource.</span></p>
