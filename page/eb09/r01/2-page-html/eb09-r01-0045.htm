<p><span class="font0">has, however, as a material for railway structures, been very generally superseded by wrought-iron, forming plate girder bridges. Timber is now almost unheard of for railway bridges on account</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of its want of durability and stiffness ; and such bridges as have formerly been built of timber in Great Britain are being rebuilt of&nbsp;stone, brick, or plate-iron.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The Forth Bridge, designed by Mr John Fowler and Mr Benjamin Baker, is the largest and most remarkable railway bridge in the&nbsp;world. One of its spans is shown in elevation and plan in fig. 20.&nbsp;The bridge consists of 2 spans of 1700 feet each, 2 of 675 each, 15&nbsp;of 168 each, and 5 of 25 each. Including the width of the piers,&nbsp;there is almost exactly 1 mile of main spans and half a mile of&nbsp;approaches by viaducts, making together about 1| miles of total&nbsp;length. The clear headway under the centre of the bridge is 150&nbsp;feet above the level of high water, and the highest part of the bridge&nbsp;is 361 above the same level. Each of the three main piers consists&nbsp;of a group of four cylindrical piers of masonry and concrete, 49 feet&nbsp;in diameter at the top and from 60 to 70 in diameter at the bottom.&nbsp;The deepest pier is about 70 feet below low water, and the rise of&nbsp;the tide is 18 feet at ordinary spring tides. In the piers there are&nbsp;about 120,000 cubic yards of masonry and in the superstructure&nbsp;44,500 tons of steel. The contract was let for the sum of £1,600,000,&nbsp;being at the rate of £645 per lineal yard. An impression of the&nbsp;magnitude of the bridge is derived from a comparison with the&nbsp;largest railway bridge in England, the Britannia Bridge, which&nbsp;has a span of 465 feet, the ratio of which to that of the Forth&nbsp;Bridge—1700 feet—is as 1 to 365־. The site of the Forth Bridge&nbsp;is at Queensferry. At this place the Firth of Forth is divided by&nbsp;the island of Inchgarvie into two channels, which, being as much&nbsp;as 200 feet in depth, precluded the construction of intermediate&nbsp;piers. Hence the adoption of two large spans of 1700 feet each,&nbsp;between which the central pier is founded on the island midway&nbsp;across. The bridge is composed of three double lattice-work cantilevers, like scale-beams, 1360 feet in length, poised on three substructures, and connected at their extremities by ordinary girders&nbsp;350 feet long, which complete the main spans. The bridge is taper&nbsp;in plan, varying from a width of 120 feet—the distance apart of&nbsp;the lower members of the cantilevers at the piers—to a minimum&nbsp;of 31 £ at the ends, in order to confer a degree of stiffness laterally,&nbsp;for resisting irregular stresses, wind - pressure in particular. The&nbsp;columns above the piers, forming the basis of the cantilevers, are&nbsp;12 feet in diameter. The lower booms, as well as the struts of the&nbsp;cantilevers, being the members in compression, are circular in cross&nbsp;section, this form of section having been selected as the most&nbsp;effective for resisting compressive stress. The lower boom is at&nbsp;the piers 12 feet in diameter, constructed of plates lj inches in&nbsp;thickness. The size is gradually reduced towards the ends, where&nbsp;the diameter is 5 feet, made of plates three-eighths of an inch in&nbsp;thickness. Correspondingly the upper member of each cantilever&nbsp;is a tapering box-lattice girder, rectangular in section, 12 feet deep</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">by 10 wide at the piers, and 5 feet by 3 at the ends. The central girders are 32 feet apart. The wind-pressure is assumed for calculation at a maximum of 56 lb per superficial foot. It is calculated&nbsp;that the maximum possible stress on any member of the bridge is&nbsp;at the rate of 7 j tons per square inch of section. The required&nbsp;ultimate strength of steel under compression is from 34 to 37 tons&nbsp;per square inch, and under tension from 30 to 33 tons. Between&nbsp;the two main girders the double line of way is to be carried on an</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Manchester and Birmingham Railway ; it is of stone, 1026 yards or more than half a mile in length and 106 feet high, and it cost&nbsp;£113,000, or £113 per yard run. The Dane viaduct, on the same&nbsp;line, is of brick, 572 yards long and 88 feet high, and it cost&nbsp;£54,000, or £96 per yard run, having 23 arches of 63 feet span.&nbsp;The Avon viaduct, on the Midland Railway, is of brick, 240 yards&nbsp;in length and 51 feet high, with 11 arches of 50 feet span ; it cost&nbsp;£14,000, or £60 per yard run. For comparison it maybe stated&nbsp;that the Britannia Tubular Bridge across the Menai Straits, 616&nbsp;yards long and 104 feet high, cost £600,000, or £974 per yard run.&nbsp;On the different lines entering London there are several miles of&nbsp;brick viaducts in the approaches to termini, and also at Manchester&nbsp;and other large cities and towns. Many interesting details might&nbsp;be given as to bridges and viaducts of the larger kind, but we must&nbsp;here confine ourselves to some account of the Forth Bridge, now in&nbsp;course of construction at Queensferry, referring the reader for other&nbsp;examples to the article Bridges.</span></p>

The way will consist of heavy bridge rails,&nbsp;Brunel section, laid on longitudinal sleepers bedded in four steel&nbsp;troughs, into which the wheels will drop in case of derailment,&nbsp;and then run on the sleepers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Railway Stations.—</span><span class="font0">Railway stations are either “terminal” or “intermediate.” A terminal station embraces (1) the passenger&nbsp;station ; (2) the goods station ; (3) the locomotive, carriage, and&nbsp;waggon depots, where the engines and the carrying stock are kept,&nbsp;cleaned, examined, and repaired. At many intermediate stations&nbsp;the same arrangements, on a smaller scale, are made ; in all of them&nbsp;there is at least accommodation for the passenger and the goods&nbsp;traffic. The stations for passengers and goods are generally in&nbsp;different and sometimes in distant positions, the place selected for&nbsp;each being that which is most convenient for the traffic. The&nbsp;passenger station abuts on the main line, or, at termini, forms the&nbsp;natural terminus, at a place as near as can conveniently be obtained&nbsp;to the centre of the population which constitutes the passenger&nbsp;traffic. The goods station is approached by a siding or fork set&nbsp;off from the main line at a point short of the passenger station.&nbsp;Terminal branches of the railways—where, for example, there is&nbsp;a sharp incline—are sometimes worked by stationary engines and&nbsp;ropes to the point where the locomotive joins the train. The locomotive station is placed wherever the ground may most conveniently be obtained, at or near to the terminus ; in some cases it is&nbsp;found at a distance of 3 or 4 miles. An abundant supply of good&nbsp;water and ample means of drainage are important at stations.&nbsp;There should be ample area of land to admit of the greatest possible&nbsp;extension of accommodation, and the erection of buildings on land&nbsp;adjacent to the station grounds should be discouraged. Companies&nbsp;have been compelled to repurchase at greatly advanced cost land&nbsp;originally disposed of by them as “surplus,” and generally with a&nbsp;view to building operations. When this course is adopted prudent&nbsp;managers should take care to secure in the conveyance power to&nbsp;repurchase the freehold at original prices, with allowance for outlay in building or otherwise, by valuation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In laying out the approaches and station-yard of passenger, stations ample width and space should be provided, with well-1&nbsp;defined means of ingress and egress to facilitate the circulation off&nbsp;vehicles, and the setting-down pavement should be as long as&nbsp;possible, to admit of several carriages discharging passengers and&nbsp;luggage at the same time. The pavement should be wide and&nbsp;sheltered from the weather by a roof, overhanging beyond the kerb,&nbsp;or spanning the roadway, but in all cases free from columns. The&nbsp;position of the main buildings relative to the direction of the lines&nbsp;of rails is the distinguishing feature in terminal stations. When&nbsp;space permits, the usual course is to place them on the departure&nbsp;side parallel to the platform, but they are frequently placed at the&nbsp;end of the station at right angles to the rails and platforms. Or&nbsp;these two systems are combined in a third arrangement, in which&nbsp;the offices are placed in a fork, between two or more series of lines&nbsp;and platforms.
