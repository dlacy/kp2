<p><span class="font0">where the whole crop ¡s strengthened by a framework of. bars, the incudate mastax lies in a little postero-ventral pouch which can be&nbsp;everted through the crop and mouth. The stomach is generally&nbsp;large; its wall consists of a layer of very large ciliated cells, which&nbsp;often contain fat globules and yellowish-green or brown particles,&nbsp;and outside these a connective tissue membrane ¡ .muscular fibrillae&nbsp;have also been described. Very constantly a pair of simple sack-like glands open into the stomach, and probably represent the&nbsp;hepato-pancreatic glands of other Invertebrates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Following upon the stomach there is a longer or shorter intestine, which ends in the cloaca. The intestine is lined by ciliated cells.&nbsp;In forms living in a tube the intestine turns round and runs forward,&nbsp;the cloaca being placed so as to debouch over the. margin ol the&nbsp;tube. The cloaca is often very large; the nephridia and oviducts&nbsp;may open into it, and the eggs lodge there on their way outwards;&nbsp;they are thrown out, as are the faecal masses, by an eversion of&nbsp;the cloaca. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Asplanchna, Notommata seiboldii,</span><span class="font0"> and certain species&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ascomorpha</span><span class="font0"> are devoid of intestine or anus, excrementitious&nbsp;matters being ejected through the mouth. The body cavity&nbsp;(archicoele) contains a fluid in which very minute corpuscles have&nbsp;been detected. There is no trace of a true vascular system. The&nbsp;nephridia (fig. i, B, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">n)</span><span class="font0"> present a very interesting stage of development. They consist of a pair of tubules with an intracellular lumen&nbsp;running up the sides of the body, at times merely sinuous, at others&nbsp;considerably convoluted. From these are given off at irregular&nbsp;intervals short lateral branches, each of which terminates in a&nbsp;flame-cell (/) precisely similar in structure to the flame-cells found&nbsp;in Planarians, Trematodes and Cestodes; here as there the question&nbsp;whether they are open to the body cavity or not must probably be&nbsp;answered in the negative. At the base these tubes open either&nbsp;into a permanent bladder (fig. I, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bl)</span><span class="font0"> which communicates with the&nbsp;cloaca, or directly into the cloaca. They have the same functions&nbsp;as the contractile vacuole of freshwater </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Protozoa (q.v.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nervous System.</span><span class="font0">—There is a large ganglion lying in close contact with the pharynx, proximal to the crop and on its antero-dorsal&nbsp;side; in Bdelloidaceae at least it is united by short connectives&nbsp;with a smaller postero-ventral ganglion to form a nerve collar.&nbsp;From this simple nerve fibres are given off to the body-wall, especially</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">to the ciliated cells of the corona, to the foot, and also to the muscles and sense organs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The sense organs are eyes, antennae, sensory styles and a statocyst in a few species. The eyes are refractive globules set in a cup of&nbsp;red pigment traversed by a nerve fibre, and lie on the proximal&nbsp;side of the body, directly on the postero-dorsal surface of the brain,&nbsp;or at a little distance from it, on the neck, often within the circle&nbsp;on the corona, and usually well within the transparent body. There&nbsp;may be one, a pair, or rarely more, the outer ones being more or&nbsp;less rudimentary. The antennae are short tubular extensions of&nbsp;the body wall, sometimes retractile with a depressed tip from which&nbsp;protrudes a tuft of fine stiff bristles. They are possibly organs of external taste (smell) as well as of touch. Typically there arc two&nbsp;pairs—a proximal, more or less approximated on the postero-dorsal&nbsp;surface, and a distal pair, more widely separate. But the proximal&nbsp;pair are often fused into a single median antenna (supplied, however,&nbsp;by two nerves), and in one case at least the distal pair may be&nbsp;similarly fused. Additional paired antennae may occur within&nbsp;the coronal surface, which is the seat of the sensory styles, of less&nbsp;complex structure, which occur in many genera. The statocyst&nbsp;(retro-cerebral organ of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">P. Marius de Beauchamp)</span><span class="font0"> is a sac filled&nbsp;with highly refractive granules soluble in dilute acids, and opening&nbsp;by a slender duct (or a pair) to the surface: its function is doubtless&nbsp;that of an organ of equilibrium, and it resembles in its opening to&nbsp;the surface the primitive internal ear of even Vertebrates, for the&nbsp;duct to the surface persists through life in the sharks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Locomotor Organs.—</span><span class="font0">Most free rotifers swim by the corona, aided by the ciliated auricles when present. In Bdelloidaceae this may&nbsp;alternate with a leech-like gait; the corona being withdrawn, the&nbsp;cupped end of the proboscis serves as a sucker for attachment&nbsp;alternately with the adherent foot, so that the animal loops its&nbsp;way along, in two families motile articulated rods occur; in&nbsp;Triarthridae they probably simply expand the dimensions of the&nbsp;body in adaptation to life at the surface; or as a protection against&nbsp;being swallowed by their smaller foes. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Polyurthra</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pteroessa&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">they are numerous, pinnated (feathered), and are doubtless used&nbsp;for active swimming by jerks; they can be moved up or down by&nbsp;special muscles attached to their bases, which project into the body.</span></p>
