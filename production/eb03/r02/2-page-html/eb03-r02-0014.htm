<p><span class="font0">ble of taſting the elevation of the one and the elegance of the other, he could never contrive to fee with their&nbsp;eyes, when he was to copy nature himſeſſ. One wonders that he could comment their works ſo well, and&nbsp;imitate them ſo little.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He quitted buſineſs himſelf ſome years before his death ; but his temperance and virtue contributed to&nbsp;protract his life to a great length in the full enjoyment&nbsp;of his underſtanding, and in the felicity of domeſtic&nbsp;friendſhip. He had had a paralytic ſtroke that affect</span><span class="font1">ed </span><span class="font0">his arm, yet never diſabled him from his cuſtomary&nbsp;walks and exerciſe. He had been in St James’s Park,&nbsp;and died ſuddenly at his houſe in Queen’s-ſquare on his&nbsp;return home, May 28. 1745, when he had paſſed the&nbsp;80th year of his age. He left a ſon and four daughters, one of whom was married to his diſciple Mr Hud-ſon, and another to Mr Grigſon an attorney. The&nbsp;tafle and learning of the ſon, and the harmony in which&nbsp;he lived with his father, are viſible in the joint works&nbsp;they compoſed. The father in 1719 publiſhed two&nbsp;diſcourſes : 1. An Eſſay on the whole Art of Criticiſm&nbsp;as it relates to Painting ; 2. An Argument in behalf of&nbsp;the Science of a Connoiſſeur ; bound in one volume octavo. In 1722 came forth An Account of ſome of&nbsp;the ſtatues, bas-reliefs, drawings, and pictures, in Italy,&nbsp;&amp;c. with Remarks by Mr Richardfon, ſenior and junior. The ſon made the journey; and from his notes,&nbsp;letters, and obſervations, they both at his return compiled this valuable work. As the father was a formal&nbsp;man, with a flow, but loud and ſonorous voice, and, in&nbsp;truth, with ſome affectation in his manner ; and as there&nbsp;is much Angularity in his ſtyle and expreſſion, theſe peculiarities (for they were ſcarcely foibles) ſtruck ſuper-ſicial readers, and between the laughers and the envious&nbsp;the book was much ridiculed. Yet both this and the&nbsp;former are full of matter, good ſenſe, and inſtruction :&nbsp;and the very quaintneſs of ſome expreſſions, and their&nbsp;laboured novelty, ſhow the difficulty the author had to&nbsp;convey mere viſible ideas through the medium of language. Thoſe works remind one of Cibber’s inimitable treatiſe on the ſtage : when an author writes on&nbsp;his own profeſſion, feels it profoundly, and is ſenſible</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">his readers do not, he is not only excuſable, but meritorious, for illuminating the ſubject by new metaphors or bolder figures than ordinary. He is the coxcomb&nbsp;that ſneers, not he that inſtructs, in appropriated diction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If theſe authors were cenſured when converſant within their own circle, it was not to be expected that&nbsp;they would be treated with milder indulgence when&nbsp;they ventured into a ſiſter region. In 1734, they publiſhed a very thick octavo, containing explanatory notes&nbsp;and remarks on Milton’s Paradiſe Loft, with the life&nbsp;of the author, and a diſcourſe on the poem. Again&nbsp;were the good ſenſe, the judicious criticiſms, and </span><span class="font1">the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">ſentiments that broke forth in this work, forgotten in&nbsp;the Angularities that diſtinguiſh it. The father having&nbsp;laid in apology for being little converſant in claſſic literature, that he had looked into them through his ſon,&nbsp;Hogarth, whom a quibble could furniſh with wit, drew&nbsp;the father peeping through the nether end of a teleſcope, with which his ſon was perforated at a Virgil&nbsp;aloft on </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">ſhelf. Yet how forcibly Richardſon entered into the ſpirit of his author, appears from his com-</span><span class="font1">prεhenflve expreſſion, that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Milton was an ancient, born</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">two thouſand years after his time.</span><span class="font0"> Richardſcn, </span><span class="font1">however, </span><span class="font0">was as incapable of reaching the ſublime or harmonious&nbsp;in poetry, as he was in painting, though ſo capable of&nbsp;illuſtrating both. Some ſpecimens of verſe that he has&nbsp;given us here and there in his works, excite no curioſi-ty for more, though he informs us in his Milton, that&nbsp;if painting was his wife, poetry had been his ſecret concubine. It is remarkable, that another commentator&nbsp;of Milton has made the ſame confeſſion,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">-Sunt ⅛<sup>5</sup> mihi carmina, me quoque dicunt</span></p>

Neither the doctor nor the painter add </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fed non ego credulus illis,</span><span class="font0"> though all their readers are&nbsp;ready to ſupply it for both. Beſides his pictures and&nbsp;commentaries, we have a few etchings by his hand, particularly two or three of Milton, and his own head.&nbsp;The ſale of his collection of drawings, in February&nbsp;1747, laſted 18 days, and produced about 20601. his&nbsp;pictures about 7001. Hudſon his ſon-in-law bought&nbsp;many of the drawings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RICHELET (Cæſar Peter), a French writer, born in 1631 at Chemin in Champagne. He was the friend&nbsp;of Patru and Ablancourt ; and like them applied him-ſelf to the ſtudy of the French language with ſucceſs.&nbsp;He compiled a dictionary of that language, full of new&nbsp;and uſeful remarks ; but exceptionable, as containing&nbsp;many ſatirical reflections and obſcenities. The belt&nbsp;edition is that of Lyons, 3 vols folio, 1728. He alſo&nbsp;collected a ſmall dictionary of rhymes, and compoſed&nbsp;ſome other pieces in the grammatical and critical way.&nbsp;He died in 1698.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RICHES, a word uſed always in the plural number, means wealth, money, poſſeſſion, or a ſplendid ſump-tuous appearance. When uſed to expreſs the fortune&nbsp;of private perſons, whether patrimonial or acquired, it&nbsp;lignifies </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">opulencea ;</span><span class="font0"> term which expreſſes not the enjoyment, but the poſſeſſion, of numerous ſuperfluities.—&nbsp;The riches of a ſtate or kingdom expreſſes the produce&nbsp;of induſtry, of commerce, of different incorporated bodies, of the internal and external adminiſtration of the&nbsp;principal members of which the ſociety is compoſed,&nbsp;&amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Our Saviour ſays, that it is more eaſy ſor a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to&nbsp;enter the kingdom of heaven ; and we find, in fact, that&nbsp;riches frequently bring along with them a degree of inattention, lukewarmneſs, and irréligion, ſuch as ſuffici-ently confirms the divine aſſertion ; which is merely </span><span class="font1">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">general truth, and which by no means aſſerts the abſo-lute impoſſibility of being virtuous and rich at the ſame&nbsp;time. For as the ancient philoſophers wiſely taught,&nbsp;riches, conſidered in themſelves, and abſtractedly from&nbsp;the bad purpoſes to which they may be applied, are not&nbsp;neceſſarily incompatible with virtue and wiſdom. They&nbsp;are indeed abſolutely indifferent ; in good hands they&nbsp;will be uſeful, and promote the cauſe of truth, virtue,&nbsp;and humanity; and in bad hands they are the ſource of&nbsp;much miſchief ; on the one band they confer the power&nbsp;of doing much good, and on the other they are equally&nbsp;powerful in doing ill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To men, however, whoſe principles of virtue are not ſufficiently founded, riches are unqueſtionably </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">dangerous and ſeducing bait ; and as the ancients rightly&nbsp;taught, they are to the greateſt number of men, in an</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
