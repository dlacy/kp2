a ſmith’s ſhop; alſo the art of a ſmith, by which iron is wrought into any ſhape by means of fire, hammering, filing, &amp; c.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">SMITING-line,</hi> in a ſhip, is a ſmall rope faſtened to the mizen-yard-arm, below at the deck, and is always furled up with the mizen-ſail, even to the upper end of the yard, and thence it comes down to the poop. Its uſe is to looſe the mizen-ſail without striking down the yard, which is eaſily done, becauſe the mizen-ſail is furled up only with rope-yarns ; and therefore when this rope is pulled hard, it breaks all the rope-yarns, and ſo the ſail falls down of itſelf. The ſailor’s phraſe is, <hi rend="italic">ſmite the mizen</hi> (whence this rope takes its name), that is, hale by this rope that the ſail may fall down.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
