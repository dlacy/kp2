        <p><span class="font0">affairs in Rome itself, consequent upon the great reforms carried
                between 450 and 442; but it is equally certain that&nbsp;now, as often afterwards,
                fortune befriended Rome by&nbsp;weakening, or by diverting the attention of, her
                opponents. In&nbsp;particular,' her rapid advance in southern Etruria
                was&nbsp;facilitated by the heavy blows inflicted upon the&nbsp;Etruscans during the
                5th century </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">B.c. </span><span
                class="font0">by Celts, Greeks&nbsp;and Samnites. By the close of this century the
                Celts&nbsp;had expelled them from the rich plains of what was afterwards&nbsp;known
                as Cisalpine Gaul, and were even threatening to advance&nbsp;across the Apennines
                into Etruria proper. The Sicilian Greeks,&nbsp;headed by the tyrants of Syracuse,
                wrested from them their&nbsp;mastery of the seas, and finally, on the capture of
                Capua by the&nbsp;Samnites in 423, they lost their possessions in the
                fertile&nbsp;Campanian plain. These conquests of the Samnites&nbsp;were part of a
                great southward movement of the highland</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Sabellian peoples, the immediate effects of which upon the fortunes
                of Rome were not confined to the weakening of the&nbsp;Etruscan power. It is
                probable that the cessation of the Sabine&nbsp;raids across the Anio was partly due
                to the new outlets which were&nbsp;opened southwards for the restless and populous
                hill tribes which&nbsp;had so long disturbed the peace of the Latin lowlands. We
                may&nbsp;conjecture, also, that the growing feebleness exhibited by Volsci&nbsp;and
                Aequi was in some measure caused by the pressure upon&nbsp;their rear of the
                Sabellian clans which at this time established&nbsp;themselves near the Fucine lake
                and along the course of the Liris.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">But in 390, only six years after the great victory over her ancient
                rival Veil, the Roman advance was for a moment&nbsp;checked by a disaster which
                threatened to alter the&nbsp;course of history in Italy, and which left a
                lasting&nbsp;impress on the Roman mind. In 391 a Celtic horde&nbsp;left their newly
                won lands on the Adriatic, and, crossing the Apennines into Etruria, laid siege to
                the Etruscan&nbsp;city of Clusium (Chiusi). Thence, provoked, it is said, by
                the&nbsp;conduct of the Roman ambassadors, who, forgetting their&nbsp;sacred
                character, had fought in the ranks of Clusium and slain a&nbsp;Celtic chief, the
                barbarians marched upon Rome. On July the&nbsp;18th of 390 b.c., only a few miles
                from Rome, was&nbsp;fought the disastrous battle of the Allia. The defeat&nbsp;of
                the Romans was complete, and Rome lay at the mercy of her&nbsp;foe. But in
                characteristic fashion the Celts halted three days to&nbsp;enjoy the fruits of
                victory, and time was thus given to put the&nbsp;Capitol at least in a state of
                defence. The arrival of the barbarians was followed by the sack of the city, but the
                Capitol&nbsp;remained impregnable. For seven months they besieged it,&nbsp;and then
                in as sudden a fashion as they had come they disappeared. The Roman chroniclers
                explain their retreat in their&nbsp;own way, by the fortunate appearance of M.
                Furius Camillus&nbsp;with the troops which he had collected, at the very
                moment&nbsp;when famine had forced the garrison on the Capitol to accept&nbsp;terms.
                More probably the news that their lands across the&nbsp;Apennines were threatened by
                the Veneti, coupled with the&nbsp;unaccustomed tedium of a long siege and the
                difficulty of obtaining supplies, inclined the Celts to accept readily a heavy
                ransom&nbsp;as the price of their withdrawal. But, whatever the reason,&nbsp;it is
                certain that they retreated, and, though during the next&nbsp;fifty years marauding
                bands appeared at intervals in the neighbourhood of Rome, and even once penetrated
                as far south as&nbsp;Campania (361-60), the Celts never obtained any&nbsp;footing in
                Italy outside the plains in the north which</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">they had made their own.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Nor, in spite of the defeat on the Allia and the sack of the city,
                was Rome weakened except for the moment by the Celtic&nbsp;attack. The storm passed
                away as rapidly as it had&nbsp;come on. The city was hastily rebuilt, and Rome
                dismayed the enemies who hastened to take advantage&nbsp;of her misfortunes by her
                undiminished vigour. Her&nbsp;conquests in southern Etruria were successfully
                defended&nbsp;against repeated attacks from the Etruscans to the north.
                The&nbsp;creation in 387 of four new tribes (Stellatina, Sabatina,&nbsp;Tromentina,
                Arnensis) marked the final annexation of&nbsp;the territory of Veii and of the lands
                lying along the Tiber valley.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">A few years later Latin colonies were established at Sutrium and
                Nepete for the more effectual defence of the frontier, and&nbsp;finally, in 353, the
                subjugation of South Etruria was&nbsp;completed by the submission of Caere
                </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span
                class="font0"> and its&nbsp;partial incorporation with the Roman state as a “
                municipium&nbsp;sine suffragio ”—the first, it is said, of its
                kind.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Next to the settlement of southern Etruria, the most important of the
                successes gained by Rome between 390 and 343 b.c. were those won against her old
                foes the Aequi&nbsp;and Volsci, and her old allies the Latins and
            Hernicans.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The Aequi indeed, already weakened by their long feud with Rome, and
                hard pressed by the Sabellian&nbsp;tribes in their rear, were easily dealt with, and
                after&nbsp;the campaign of 389 we have no further mention of&nbsp;an Aequian war
                until the last Aequian rising in 304.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The Volsci, who in 389 had advanced to Lanuvium, were met and utterly
                defeated by Camillus, the conqueror of&nbsp;Veii, and this victory was followed up
                by the gradual subjugation to Rome of all the lowland country lying between
                the&nbsp;hills and the sea as far south as Tarracina. Latin colonies&nbsp;were
                established at Satricum (385), at Setia (379), and&nbsp;at Antium and Tarracina some
                time before 348. In&nbsp;358 two fresh Roman tribes (Pomptina and
                Publilia)&nbsp;were formed in the same district.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Rome had now nothing more to fear from the foes who a century ago had
                threatened her very existence. The lowland&nbsp;country, of which she was the
                natural centre, from&nbsp;the Ciminian forest to Tarracina, was quiet,
                and&nbsp;within its limits Rome was by far the strongest power.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">But she had now to reckon with the old and faithful allies to whose
                loyal aid her present position was&nbsp;largely due. The Latini and Hernici had
                suffered severely in&nbsp;the Aequian and Volscian wars; it is probable that not a
                few&nbsp;of the smaller communities included in the league had either&nbsp;been
                destroyed or been absorbed by larger states, and the&nbsp;independence of all alike
                was threatened by the growing power&nbsp;of Rome. The sack of Rome by the Celts gave
                them an opportunity of reasserting their independence, and we are consequently told
                that this disaster was immediately followed by&nbsp;the temporary dissolution of the
                confederacy, and this again&nbsp;a few years later by a series of actual conflicts
                between Rome&nbsp;and her former allies. Between 383 and 358 we hear&nbsp;of wars
                with Tibur, Praeneste, Tusculum, Lanuvium,</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Circeii and the Hernici. But in all Rome was successful. In 382
                Tusculum was fully incorporated with the Roman&nbsp;state by the bestowal of the
                full franchise;<sup>@@3 </sup>in 358,&nbsp;according to both Livy and Polybius, the
                old alliance&nbsp;was formally renewed with Latini and Hernici. We
                cannot,&nbsp;however, be wrong in assuming that the position of the
                allies&nbsp;under the new league was far inferior to that accorded them&nbsp;by the
                treaty of Spurius Cassius.<sup>@@4</sup> Henceforth they were the&nbsp;subjects
                rather than the equals of Rome, a position which it is&nbsp;evident that they
                accepted much against their will, and from&nbsp;which they were yet to make one last
                effort to escape.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">We have now reached the close of the first stage in Rome’s advance
                towards supremacy in Italy. By 343 </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-weight:bold;">B.c. </span><span class="font0">she was&nbsp;already
                mistress both of the low country stretching&nbsp;from the Ciminian forest to
                Tarracina and Circeii and&nbsp;of the bordering highlands. Her own territory had
                largely&nbsp;increased. Across the Tiber the lands of Veii, Capena and&nbsp;Caere
                were nearly all Roman, while in Latium she had carried&nbsp;her frontiers to
                Tusculum on the Alban range and to the&nbsp;southernmost limits of the Pomptine
                district. And this territory&nbsp;was protected by a circle of dependent allies and
                colonies reaching northward to-Sutrium and Nepete, and southward to Sora&nbsp;on the
                upper Liris, and to Circeii on the coast. Already, too,&nbsp;she was beginning to be
