<p><span class="font1">knights, squires, heralds and priests, more suited to royal than baronial rank. He kept open house, was a munificent patron&nbsp;of literature and of music, and his lihrary contained many&nbsp;valuable works, he himself being a skilled illuminator and&nbsp;binder. He also indulged a passion for the stage. At the&nbsp;chief festivals he gave performances of mysteries and moralities,&nbsp;and it has been asserted that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mystère de la Passion,</span><span class="font1"> acted&nbsp;at Angers in 1420, was staged by him in honour of his own&nbsp;marriage. The original draft of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mystery of Orleans</span><span class="font1"> was&nbsp;prohahly written under his direction, and contains much detail&nbsp;which may be well accounted for by his intimate acquaintance&nbsp;with the Maid. In his financial difficulties he began to alienate&nbsp;his lands, selling his estates for small sums. These proceedings&nbsp;provided his heirs with material for lawsuits for many years.&nbsp;Among those who profited by his prodigality were the duke&nbsp;of Brittany, and his chancellor, Jean de Malestróit, bishop of&nbsp;Nantes, but in 1436 his kinsfolk appealed to Charles VII., who&nbsp;proclaimed further sales to he illegal. Jean V. refused to&nbsp;acknowledge the king’s right to promulgate a decree of this&nbsp;kind in Brittany, and replied by making Gilles de Rais lieutenant&nbsp;of Brittany and by acknowledging him as a brother-in-arms.&nbsp;Gilles hoped to redeem his fortunes by alchemy; he also spent&nbsp;large sums on necromancers, who engaged to raise the devil&nbsp;for his assistance. On the other hand he sought to guarantee&nbsp;himself from evil consequences by extravagant charity and a&nbsp;splendid celebration of the rites of the church. The abominable&nbsp;practices of which he was really guilty seem not to have heen&nbsp;suspected by his equals or superiors, though he had many&nbsp;accomplices and his criminality was suspected by the peasantry.&nbsp;His wife finally left him in 1434-35, and may possibly have&nbsp;become acquainted with his doings, and when his hrother Rene&nbsp;de la Suze seized Champtocé, all traces of his crimes had not&nbsp;been removed, but family considerations no doubt imposed&nbsp;silence. His servants kidnapped children, generally boys, on&nbsp;his behalf, and these he tortured and murdered. The number&nbsp;of his victims was stated in the ecclesiastical trial to have&nbsp;been 140, and larger figures are quoted. The amazing impunity which he enjoyed was brought to an end in 1440, when&nbsp;he was imprudent enough to come into conflict with the church&nbsp;by an act of violence which involved sacrilege and infringement&nbsp;of clerical immunity. He had sold Saint Étienne de Malemort&nbsp;to the duke of Brittany’s treasurer, G effroi le Ferron. In the&nbsp;course of a quarrel over the delivery of the property to this&nbsp;man’s brother, Jean le Ferron, Gilles seized Jean, who was in&nbsp;clerical orders, in church, and imprisoned him. He then pro-ceeded to defy the duke, but was reconciled to him by Richemont. In the autumn, however, he was arrested and cited&nbsp;before the bishop of Nantes on various charges, the chief of&nbsp;which were heresy and murder. With the latter count the&nbsp;ecclesiastical court was incompetent to deal, and on the 8th&nbsp;of October Gilles refused to accept its jurisdiction. Terrified&nbsp;by excommunication, however, he acknowledged the evidence&nbsp;of the witnesses, and by confession he secured absolution.&nbsp;He had been pronounced guilty of apostasy and heresy by the&nbsp;inquisitor, and of vice and sacrilege by the bishop. A detailed&nbsp;confession was extracted by the threat of torture on the 21st&nbsp;of October. A separate and parallel inquiry was made by&nbsp;Pierre de l’Hôpital, president of the Breton parliament, by&nbsp;whose sentence he was hanged (not burned alive as is sometimes&nbsp;stated), on the 26th of October 1440, with two of his accomplices.&nbsp;In view of his own repeated confessions it seems impossible to&nbsp;doubt his guilt, but the numerous irregularities of the pro-ceedings, the fact that his necromancer Prelati and other of&nbsp;his chief accomplices went unpunished, taken together with the&nbsp;financial interest of Jean V. in his ruin, have left a certain&nbsp;mystery over a trial, which, with the exception of the process&nbsp;of Joan of Arc, was the most famous in 15th-century France.&nbsp;His name is connected with the tale of Bluebeard </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q. υ. )</span><span class="font1"> in local&nbsp;tradition at Machecoul, Tiffauges, Pornic and Chéméré, though&nbsp;the similarity between the two histories is at best vague. The&nbsp;records of the trial are preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale&nbsp;in Paris, at Nantes and elsewhere.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RAISIN (Fr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raisin,</span><span class="font1"> grape; Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">racemus</span><span class="font1">)</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font1"> the name given to the dried fruits of certain varieties of the grape vine, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vitis&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">υinifera,</span><span class="font1"> which grow principally in the warm climate of the&nbsp;Mediterranean coasts and are comparatively rich in sugar.&nbsp;The use of dried grapes or raisins as food is of great antiquity&nbsp;(Num. vi. 3; I Sam. xxv. 18, xxx. 12). In medieval times&nbsp;raisins imported from Spain were a prized luxury in England,&nbsp;and. to the present day Great Britain continues to be the best&nbsp;customer of the raisin-producing regions. “ Raisins of the&nbsp;sun ” are obtained by letting the fruit continue on the vines&nbsp;after it has come to maturity, where there is sufficient sunshine&nbsp;and heat in the autumn, till the clusters dry on the stocks.&nbsp;Another plan is partially to sever the stalk before the grapes&nbsp;are quite ripe, thus stopping the flow of the sap, and in that&nbsp;condition to leave them on the vines till they are sufficiently&nbsp;dry. The more usual process, however, is to cut off the fully&nbsp;ripe clusters and expose them, spread out, for several days to&nbsp;the rays of the sun, taking care that they are not injured by&nbsp;rain. In unfavourable weather they may be dried in a heated&nbsp;chamber, but are then inferior in quality. In some parts of&nbsp;Spain and France it is common to dip the gathered clusters in&nbsp;boiling water, or in a strong potash lye, a practice which softens&nbsp;the skin, favours drying and gives the raisins a clear glossy&nbsp;appearance. Again, in Asia Minor the fruit is dipped into hot&nbsp;water on the surface of which swims a layer of olive oil, which&nbsp;communicates a bright lustre and softness to the skin. Some&nbsp;superior varieties are treated with very great care, retained&nbsp;on their stalks, and sent into the market as clusters for table&nbsp;use; but the greater part are separated from the stalks in the&nbsp;process of drying and the stalks winnowed out of the fruit.&nbsp;Raisins come from numerous Mediterranean localities, and&nbsp;present at least three distinct varieties—(1) ordinary or large&nbsp;raisins, (2) sultana seedless raisins, and (3) currants or Corinthian&nbsp;raisins (see Currant). The greater proportion of the common&nbsp;large raisins of English commerce comes from the provinces&nbsp;of Malaga, Valencia and Alicante in Spain; these are known&nbsp;by the common name of Malaga raisins. Those of the finest&nbsp;quality, called Malaga clusters, are prepared from a variety of&nbsp;muscatel grape, and preserved on the stalks for table use. This&nbsp;variety, as well as Malaga layers, so called from the manner&nbsp;of packing, are exclusively used as dessert fruit. Raisins of&nbsp;a somewhat inferior quality, known as “ lexias, ” from the&nbsp;same provinces, are used for cooking and baking purposes.&nbsp;Smyrna raisins also come to some extent into the English&nbsp;market. The best quality, known as Elemé, is a large fruit,&nbsp;having a reddish-yellow skin with a sweet pleasant flavour.&nbsp;Large-seeded dark-coloured raisins are produced in some&nbsp;of the islands of the Greek archipelago and in Crete, but they&nbsp;are little seen in the British markets. In Italy the finest raisins&nbsp;are produced in Calabria, inferior qualities in central Italy&nbsp;and in Sicily. From the Lipari Islands a certain quantity of&nbsp;cluster raisins of good quality is sent to England. In the&nbsp;south of France raisins of high excellence—Provence raisins&nbsp;in clusters—are obtained at Roquevaire, Lunel and Frontignan.&nbsp;Sultana seedless raisins are the produce of a small variety of&nbsp;yellow grape, cultivated exclusively in the neighbourhood&nbsp;of Smyrna. The vines axe grown on a soil of decomposed&nbsp;hippurite limestone, on sloping ground rising to a height of&nbsp;400 ft. above the sea, and all attempts to cultivate sultanas&nbsp;in other raisin-growing localities have failed, the grapes&nbsp;quickly reverting to a seed-bearing character. The dried&nbsp;fruit has a fine golden-yellow colour, with a thin,&nbsp;delicate, translucent skin and a sweet aromatic flavour.&nbsp;A very fine seedless oblong raisin of the sultana type&nbsp;with a brownish skin is cultivated in the neighbourhood of&nbsp;Damascus.</span></p>
