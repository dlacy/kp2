                the&nbsp;various city companies. Early in the 19th century (1806) the
                Lord&nbsp;Mayor began to wear on some state occasions a black robe with

        <p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Academic Costume.</span><span
                class="font1">—No thorough study has so far been made of early English academic
                costume as compared with that of&nbsp;the continental univcrsitics”-a study which
                ought to throw&nbsp;much light on the subject.@@3 A vexed question is that of
                how&nbsp;far academic dress is derived from the ecclesiastical. Anthony&nbsp;Wood’s
                view, that it was derived from the </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">tunica talaris</span><span class="font1">
                and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cucullus</span><span
                class="font1"> of the Benedictines, would not now meet with much&nbsp;support; but
                many writers seem to be unnecessarily anxious&nbsp;to trace each item of the
                academic robes to some definite ecclesiastical garment. The medieval scholar was of
                course a clerk,&nbsp;and had to wear the clerkly gown and the tonsure. But
                the&nbsp;fact that this was the case makes it more difficult to
                distinguish&nbsp;between academical and ecclesiastical robes, notably in
                the&nbsp;case of brasses and other monuments of university graduates&nbsp;and
                dignitaries who were also priests. Another source of&nbsp;difficulty is the variety
                of names by which the different parts&nbsp;of the academic costume are called in the
                university statutes&nbsp;and elsewhere, resulting sometimes in inextricable
                confusion.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The earliest information as to English academic dress is found in the
                second half of the 14th century. Certain early&nbsp;statutes show that “ excess in
                apparel ” had already to be&nbsp;rebuked in scholars (cf. the Constitution of
                Archbishop Stratford, 1342), while the statutes of certain colleges require of
                the&nbsp;scholars the tonsure and a “ decent habit ” suitable to a clerk&nbsp;(cf.
                Statutes of Peterhouse, 1344, and of Merton ColI., Oxford),&nbsp;</span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> a long gown
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(toga</span><span

                talaris),</span><span class="font1"> which it is stipulated&nbsp;in some cases must
                be closed in front. Some colleges had&nbsp;liveries, prescribed perhaps by the
                founder of the college and&nbsp;laid down by the statutes. The differences of colour
                and shape&nbsp;in the undergraduate gowns of most of the Cambridge colleges&nbsp;are
                supposed to be a survival of this. There was also an ordinance&nbsp;of Richard II.
                for King’s Hall, Cambridge (1379), which fixed&nbsp;the dress of a scholar as the
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">roba talaris,</span><span
                class="font1"> over which, if a bachelor,&nbsp;he should wear a tabard suited to his
                degree. The undergraduates seem in the early days to have worn a hood,
                the&nbsp;ordinary head-covering worn by all, but they gradually ceased&nbsp;to do
                so, until nobody below the rank of a bachelor might&nbsp;wear one.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">It is proposed to give here (1) a list of the various parts of the
                academic dress, with a few remarks on each; (2) a short&nbsp;account of the early
                costume of the various degrees; (3) a&nbsp;sketch of any changes which have taken

                is hard to determine whether&nbsp;there was at first any difference between the gown

                    entry&nbsp;of Charles II. in 1660. In 1702, when Queen Anne went to a
                    thanksgiving service at St Paul’s, -the Lord Mayor wore crimson
                    velvet,&nbsp;with the collar and jewel; but in 1705, at the thanksgiving
                    after&nbsp;Blenheim, he met the queen on horseback, dressed in scarlet.
