<p><span class="font2">mental to individuals who have ſuffered by depredations from foreign potentates, our laws have in ſome reſpects&nbsp;armed the fubject. with powers to impel the preroga-tive ; by directing the miniſters of the crown to iffue&nbsp;letters of marque and repriſal upon due demand : the&nbsp;prerogative of granting which is nearly related to, and&nbsp;plainly derived ſrom, that other of making war ; this&nbsp;being indeed only an incomplete ſtate of hoſtilities, and&nbsp;generally ending in a formal denunciation of war. Theſe&nbsp;letters are grantable by the law of nations, whenever the&nbsp;ſubjects of one ſtate are oppreffed and injured by thoſe&nbsp;of another; and juſtice is denied by that ſtate to which&nbsp;the oppreſlbr belongs. In this caſe letters of marque&nbsp;and repriſal words uſed as ſynonymous ; and ſignify-ing, the latter a taking in return, the former the paſſing&nbsp;the frontiers in order to ſuch taking) may be obtained,&nbsp;in order to ſeize the bodies or goods of the ſubjects of&nbsp;the offending ſtate, until fatisfaction be made, where-ever they happen to be found. And indeed this cuſtom&nbsp;of reprifals ſeems dictated by nature herfelf; for which&nbsp;reaſon we ſind in the moſt ancient times very notable&nbsp;inftances of it. But here the neceſſity is obvious of&nbsp;calling in the fovereign power, to determine when reprifals may be made ; elſe every private ſufferer would&nbsp;be a judge in his own cauſe. In purſuance of which&nbsp;principle, it is with us declared by the ſtat. 4 Hen. V.&nbsp;c. 7. that, if any ſubjects of the realm are oppreffed in&nbsp;time of truce by any foreigners, the king will grant&nbsp;marque in due form, to all that feel themſelves grieved,&nbsp;which form is thus directed to be obſerved : the ſuf-ferer muſt firſt apply to the lord privy-feal, and he ſhall&nbsp;make out letters of requeſt under the privy, ſeal; and if after ſuch requeſt of fatisfaction made, the paaty required&nbsp;-do not within convenient time make due fatisfaction or&nbsp;reſtitution to the party grieved, the lord-chancellor ſhall&nbsp;make him out letters of marque under the great ſeal ;&nbsp;and by virtue of theſe he may attack and ſeize the property of the aggreffor nation, without hazard of being&nbsp;condemned as a robber or pirate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Reprisal, or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Recaption,</span><span class="font2"> is a ſpecies of remedy al-Iowed to an injured perſon. This happens when any one hath deprived another of his property in goods or&nbsp;chattels perfonal, or wrongfully detains one’s wife, child,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font2">ſervant : in which caſe the owner of the goods, and&nbsp;the huſhand, parent, or maſter, may lawfully claim and&nbsp;■retake them, wherever he happens to find them ; ſo it&nbsp;be not in a riotous manner, or attended with a breach&nbsp;ol the peace. The reaſon for this is obvious ; ſince it&nbsp;may frequently happen that the owner may have this&nbsp;©nly opportunity of doing himſelf juſtic? : his goods&nbsp;may be afterwards conveyed away or deſtroyed ; and&nbsp;his wife, children, or ſervants, concealed or carried out&nbsp;of his reach ; if he had no ſpeedier remedy than the ordinary proceſs of law. If therefore he can ſo contrive&nbsp;it as to gain poffeſſion of his property again, without&nbsp;force or terror, the law favours and will juſtify his proceeding. But, as the public peace is a ſuperior conſideration to any one man’s private property ; and as, if&nbsp;individuals were once allowed to uſe private force&nbsp;as a remedy for private injuries, all ſocial juſtice&nbsp;-muſt ceaſe, the ſtrong would give law to the weak,&nbsp;and every man would revert to a ſtate of nature ;&nbsp;for theſe reafons it is provided, that this natural right&nbsp;of recaption ſhall never be exerted, where ſueh exertion&nbsp;■muſt occaſion ſtrife and bodily </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">contention, </span><span class="font2">or </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">endanger</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2">the peace oſ fociety. If, for inſtance, my horſe is </span><span class="font1">ta-</span><span class="font2">ken away, and I ſind him in a common, a fair, or a public inn, I may lawfully ſeize him to my own uſe :&nbsp;but I cannot juſtify breaking open a private ſtable, or&nbsp;entering on the grounds of a third perſon, to take him,&nbsp;except he be feloniouſiy ſtolen ; but muſt have recourſe&nbsp;to an action at law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REPROBATION, in theology, means the act of abandoning, or ſtate of being abandoned, to eternal de-ſtruction, and is applied to that decree or reſolve which&nbsp;God has taken from all eternity to puniſh ſinners who&nbsp;ſhall die in impenitence ; in which ſenſe it is directly op-poſed to election. When a ſinner is ſo hardened as to&nbsp;feel no remorſe or miſgiving of conſcience, it is conſidered as a ſign of reprobation ; which by the caſuiſts&nbsp;has been diſtinguiſhed into pofitive and negative. The&nbsp;ſirſt is that whereby God is ſuppoſed to create men&nbsp;with a pofitive and abſolute refolution to damn them&nbsp;eternally. This opinion is countenanced by St Auguſ-tſhe and other Chriſtian fathers, and is a peculiar tenet&nbsp;of Calvin and moſt of his followers. The church of&nbsp;England, in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The thirty-nine Articles,</span><span class="font2"> teaches fomething&nbsp;like it ; and the church of Scotland, in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Confejfion of&nbsp;Faith,</span><span class="font2"> maintains it in the ſtrongeſt terms. But the&nbsp;notion is generally exploded, and is believed by no rational divine in either church, being totally injurious to&nbsp;the juſtice of the Deity. Negative or conditional reprobation is that whereby God, though he has a ſincere&nbsp;deſire to ſave men, and furniſhes them with the neceffary&nbsp;means, fo that all if they will may be ſaved, yet fees&nbsp;that there are many who will not be ſaved by the&nbsp;means, however powerful, that are afforded them; tho*&nbsp;by other means which the Deity fees, but will not afford them, they might be ſaved. Reprobation reſpects&nbsp;angels as well as men, and reſpects the latter either&nbsp;fallen or unfallen. See Predestination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REPRODUCTION, is uſually underſtood to mean the re il oration of a thing before exiſting, and ſince deſtroyed. It is very well known that trees and plants&nbsp;may be raiſed from Hips and cuttings ; and fome late&nbsp;obſervations have ſhown, that there are foιne animals&nbsp;which have the fame property. The polype * was the&nbsp;ſirſt inſtance we had ot this ; but we had ſcarce time&nbsp;to wonder at the diſcovery Mr Trembley had made,&nbsp;when Mr Bonett diſcovered the ſame property in a&nbsp;ſpecies of water-worm. Amongſt the plants which&nbsp;may be raiſed from cuttings, there are ſome which ſeem to&nbsp;pυffei's this quality in ſo eminent a degree, that the ſmal-leſt portion of them will become a complete tree again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It deſerves inquiry, whether or not the great Author of nature, when he ordained that certain infects, as theie polypes and worms, ſhould reſemble thoſe plants&nbsp;in that particular, allovzed them this power of being re-produced in the ſame degree ? or, which is the Tame&nbsp;thing, whether this reproduction will or will not take&nbsp;place in whatever part the worm is cut? fn order to&nbsp;try this, Mr Bonett entered on a courfe of many experiments on the water-worms which have this property. Theſe are, at their common growth, from two to&nbsp;three inches long, and of a browniſh colour, with a caſt&nbsp;oſ reddiſh. From one of theſe worms he cut off the&nbsp;head and tail, taking from each extremity only a ſmall&nbsp;piece of a twelfth of an inch in length ; but neither of&nbsp;theſe pieces were able to reproduce what was wanting.&nbsp;They both periſhed in about 24 hours ; the tail firſt,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
