Under Wolfgang Dietrich many Protestant citizens were driven from the town and their houses demolished. In spite, however, of rigorous persecution the new faith spread in secret, especially among the landward subjects of the archbishop, and a new and more searching edict of expulsion was issued by Archbishop Von Firmian in 1727. The Protestants invoked the aid of Frederick William I. of Prussia, who procured for them permission to sell their goods and to emigrate ; and in 1731 and 1732 Salzburg parted to Prussia with about 30,000 industrious and peaceful citizens. About 6000 of these came from the capital.</p><p>By the peace of Lunéville Salzburg was given to the archduke of Austria and grand-duke of Tuscany in exchange for Tuscany ; and its new owner was enrolled among the electoral princes. In the re- distribution following the peace of Pressburg in 1805, Salzburg fell to Austria. Four years later it passed to Bavaria, but the peace of Paris in 1814 restored it to Austria, to which it has since belonged. Under the designation of a duchy the territory formed the department of Salzach in Upper Austria until 1849, when it was made a separate crown-land, with the four departments of Salzburg, Zell, Tamsweg, and St Johann. In 1861 the management of its affairs was entrusted to a local diet, consisting of the governor, the archbishop, and twenty-five representatives. The area of the duchy is 2762 square miles and the population in 1880 was 163,570, almost exclusively Roman Catholic and of German stock. (F. MU.)</p><p>SALZKAMMERGUT, a district in the south-west angle of Upper Austria, between Salzburg and Styria, famous for its fine scenery, forms a separate imperial domain about 250 square miles in area, and with a population of over 18,000. The beauty of its lofty mountains, sequestered lakes, and green valleys has made it one of the favourite tourist resorts of Europe, and has gained for it the title of the “Austrian Switzerland”; but it owes its name (literally “ salt-exchequer property ”) and its economic importance to its extensive and valuable salt mines. The chief lakes are the Traunsee or Lake of Gmunden, the Lake of Hallstatt, the Attersee or Kammersee (the largest lake in Austria), the Mondsee, and the St Wolfgang Lake. The principal mountains are the Dachstein (9849 feet), Thorstein (9659 feet), the Todte Gebirge with the summits of Priel (8238 feet) and others, and the Höllengebirge (6371 feet). The Schafberg (5840 feet) or “ Austrian Rigi ” and the Traunstein (5548 feet), isolated peaks among the lakes, are well-known tourist points. In the very heart of the salt-yielding district lies the fashionable spa of Ischl; but the capital of the Salzkammergut is Gmunden, situated on the Traunsee at the exit of the Traun, the chief river of the district. Cattle-rearing and forestry are carried on to a certain extent by the people, but between 6000 and 7000 of them are engaged in the salt-mines and evaporating works, which yield annually about 60,000 tons of salt. The sale of the salt is an Austrian crown-monopoly. The most important salt-works are at Ischl, Hallstatt, Ebensee, and Aussee.

It is an industrial place of some importance, with linen, cotton, and woollen manufactures, carries on a brisk river trade in grain, and possesses a fine Gothic church of the 13th century. But its chief claim to notice lies in the fact that it was for about a century (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 1070-1170) the capital of the Old or North Mark (also for a time called the “ Mark of Soltwedel ”), the kernel of the Prussian state. The old castle, perhaps founded by Charlemagne, was purchased in 1864 by the king of Prussia, anxious to preserve this interesting relic. Salzwedel was also a member of the Hanseatic League, and at the beginning of the 16th century seems to have engrossed great part of the inland commerce of North Germany. The population in 1880 was 8780.</p><p>SÁMÁNID DYNASTY, the name of the third among those native dynasties which sprang up in the 9th and 10th centuries in the eastern portions of Persia, and, although</p><p>nominally provincial governors under the suzerainty of the caliphs of Baghdad, succeeded in a very short time in establishing an almost independent rule over the vast territories round the Oxus and Jaxartes. The Ma’mún, Hárún-al- rashid’s son, to whose patronage the Táhirid family owed their supremacy in Khorásán and Transoxiana (820-872, 205-259 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.)</hi> appointed three sons of Sámán, originally a Tartar chief who claimed descent from the old Sásánian kings, governors of Herát and some districts beyond the Oxus; and these soon gained such an ascendency over all rival clanships that in 872, when the Táhirids were overthrown by the Saffárids under the leadership of Ya'ḳúb b. Laith (868-878), they were strong enough to retain in their family the governorship of Transoxiana, with the official sanction of the caliph Mo'tamid (870-892), and to establish a semi-royal court in Bokhárá, the seat of the new Sámánid government. During the reign of Ya'ḳúb’s brother 'Amr b. Laith (878-900) Isma'il b. Ahmad, Sámán’s great-grandson (892-907, 279-295 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.),</hi> crossed the Oxus with a powerful army, invaded the territory of the Saffárids, sent 'Amr as prisoner to Baghdad, and gradually extended his rule over Khorásán, Khwárizm, Jurján, and the neighbouring countries. His successors, all renowned by the high impulse they gave both to the patriotic feelings and the national poetry of modern Persia (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Persia,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 655 <hi rend="italic">sq.),</hi> were Ahmad b. Isma'íl (907-913, 295-301 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.) ;</hi> Nasr II. b. Ahmad, the patron and friend of the great poet Rúdagí (913-942, 301-331 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.);</hi> Núh I. b. Naṣr (942-954, 331-343 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.);</hi> 'Abd al-Malik I. b. Núḥ (954-961, 343-350 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.);</hi> Mansur I. b. Núḥ, whose vizier Bal'amí translated Tabari’s universal history into Persian (961-976, 350-366 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.);</hi> Núḥ II. b. Mansur, whose court-poet Daḳíḳí commenced the <hi rend="italic">Sháhnáma</hi> (976-997, 366-387 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.)</hi> ; Mansur II. b. Núḥ (997-998, 387-389 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.);</hi> and 'Abd al-Malik II. b. Núḥ (999), with whom the Sámánid dynasty came to a rather abrupt end. The rulers of this powerful house, whose silver dirhems had an extensive currency during the 10th century all over the northern part of Asia, and were brought, through Russian caravans, even so far as to Pomerania, Sweden, and Norway, where Sámánid coins have lately been found in great number, suffered in their turn the fate they had prepared for their predecessors; they were overthrown by a more youthful and vigorous race, that of Sabuktagín, which founded the illustrious Ghaznawid dynasty and the Mussulman empire of India. Under 'Abd al-Malik I. a Turkish slave, Alptagín, had been entrusted with the government of Bokhárá, but, showing himself hostile to 'Abd al-malik’s successor Mansur I., he was compelled to fly and to take refuge in the mountainous regions of Ghazna, where he soon established a semi-independent rule, to which, after his death in 977 (367 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.),</hi> his son-in-law Sabuktagín, likewise a former Turkish slave, succeeded. Núḥ II., in order to retain at least a nominal sway over those Afghán territories, confirmed him in his high position and even invested Sabuktagín’s son Maḥmtúd with the governorship of Khorásán, in reward for the powerful help they had given him in his desperate struggles with a confederation of disaffected nobles of Bokhárá under the leadership of Fá’iḳ and the troops of the Dailamites, a dynasty that had arisen on the shores of the Caspian Sea and wrested already from the hands of the Sámánids all their western provinces. Unfortunately, Sabuktagín died in the same year as Núḥ II. (997, 387 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.),</hi> and Mahmud, confronted with an internal contest against his own brother Isma'íl, had to withdraw his attention for a short time from the affairs in Khorásán and Transoxiana. This interval sufficed for the old rebel leader Fa’iḳ, supported by a strong Tartar army under Ilekkhán, to turn Núḥ’s successor Manṣúr II. into a mere puppet, to concentrate all the</p></body></text></TEI>
