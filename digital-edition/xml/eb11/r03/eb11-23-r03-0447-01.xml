                <p><label>RODGERS, JOHN</label> (1771-1838), American sailor, was born in Harford
                    county, Maryland, on the nth of July 1771. He entered the United States navy
                    when it was organized in 179S. He was second in command to Commodore James
                    Barron (1769-1851) in the expedition against the Barbary pirates, and succeeded
                    him in the command in 1805. In this year he brought both Tunis and Tripoli to
                    terms, and then returned to America. In 1811 he was in command as commodore of
                    the U.S. frigate “ President ” (44) off Annapolis when he heard that an American
                    seaman had been “ pressed ” by a British frigate off Sandy Hook. Commodore
                    Rodgers was ordered to sea “ to protect American commerce,” but he may have had
                    verbal instructions to retaliate for the impressment of real or supposed British
                    subjects out of American vessels, which was causing much ill-feeling and was a
                    main cause of the War of 1812. On the 16th of May 1811 he sighted and followed
                    the British sloop “ Little Belt ” (22), and after some hailing and
                    counter-hailing, of which very different versions are given on either side, a
                    gun was fired, each side accusing the other of the aggression, and an action
                    ensued in which the “ Little Belt ” was cut to pieces. The incident, which was
                    represented as an accident by the Americans, and believed to be a deliberate
                    aggression by the British navy, had a share in bringing on war. When hostilities
                    broke out Rodgers commanded a squadron on the coast of America, and was wounded
                    by the bursting of one of his guns while pursuing the British frigate “
                    Belvedere.” He was subsequently President of the Board of Navy Commissioners in
                    1815-1824 and in 1827-1837, and acting secretary of the navy in 1823 for two
                    weeks. He died in Philadelphia on the 1st of August 1838.</p>
               <p>His brother, George Washington Rodgers (1787-1832), a brother-in-law of
                    Commodore Perry, served in the War of 1812 and in the war with Algiers (1815).
                    Rear-Admiral John Rodgers (1812-1882), a son of Commodore John Rodgers,' served
                    in the Union navy and in 1877-1882 was superintendent of the Naval Observatory
                    at Washington. G. W. Rodgers had two sons who were naval officers, Christopher
                    Raymond Perry Rodgers (1819-1892) and George Washington Rodgers (1822-1863).</p>
