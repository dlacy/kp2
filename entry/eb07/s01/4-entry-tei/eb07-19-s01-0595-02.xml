in Greek antiquity, were nocturnal mysteries in honour of Jupiter Sabazius. All the initiated had a golden serpent put in at their breasts, and taken out at the lower part of their garments, in memory of Jupiterâ€™s ravishing Proserpina in the form of a serpent. There were also other feasts and sacrifices distinguished by this appel</p><p>lation, in honour of Mithras, the deity of the Persians, and of Bacchus, who was thus denominated by the Sabians, a people of Thrace.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
