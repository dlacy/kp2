The rice plant is an annual grass with long linear glabrous leaves, each provided with a long sharply pointed ligule. The spikelets are borne on a compound or branched spike, erect at first but afterwards bent downwards. Each spikelet contains a solitary flower with two outer small barren glumes, above which is a large tough, compressed, often awned, flowering glume, which partly encloses the somewhat similar pale. Within these are six stamens, a hairy ovary surmounted by two feathery styles which ripens into the fruit (grain), and which is invested by the husk formed by the persistent glume and pale. The cultivated varieties are extremely numerous, some kinds being adapted for marshy land, others for growth on the hillsides. The cultivators make two principal divisions according· as the sorts are early or late. Rice has been cultivated from time immemorial in tropical countries. According to Stanislas Julien a ceremonial ordinance was established in China By the emperor Chin-nung 2800 years B.C., in accordance with which the emperor sows the rice himself while the seeds of four other kinds may be sown by the princes of his family. This fact, joined to other considerations, induced Alphonse de Candolle to consider rice as a native of China. It was very early cultivated in India, in some parts of which country, as in tropical Australia, it is, as we have seen, indigenous. It is not mentioned in the Bible, but its culture is alluded to in the Talmud. There is proof of its culture in the Euphrates valley and in Syria four hundred years before Christ. Crawfurd, on philological grounds, considers that rice was introduced into Persia from southern India. The Arabs carried the plant into Spain. Rice was first cultivated in Italy near Pisa in 1468. It was not introduced into S. Carolina until 1700, and then, it is said, by accident, although at one time the southern United States furnished a large proportion of the rice introduced into commerce. Rice sports into far more varieties than any of the corns familiar to Europeans; for some varieties grow in the water and some on dry land; some come to maturity in three months, while others take four and six months to do so. A very full account of the cultivation of rice in India will be found in Sir George Watt’s</p><p><hi rend="italic">Dictionary of the Economic Products of India.</hi></p><p>Rice constitutes one of the most important articles of food in all tropical and subtropical countries, and is one of the most prolific of all crops. The rice yields best on low lands subject to occasional inundations, and thus enriched by alluvial deposits. An abundant rainfall during the growing season is also a desideratum. Rice is sown broadcast, and in some districts is transplanted after a fortnight or three weeks. No special rotation is followed: indeed the soil best suited for rice is ill adapted for any other crop. In some cases little manure is employed, but in others abundance of manure is used. No special tillage is required, but weeding and irrigation are requisite. Ricc in the husk is known as ” paddy.” On cutting across a grain of rice and examining it under the microscope, first the flattened and dried cells of the husk arc seen, and then one or two layers of cells elongated in a direction parallel to the length of the seed, which contain the gluten or nitrogenous matter. Within these, and forming by far the largest part of the seed, arc large polygonal cells filled with very numerous and very minute angular starch grains. Ricc is not so valuable as a food as some OthercereaIs<hi rend="sub">l </hi>inasmuch as the proportion of nitrogenous matter (gluten) is less. Payen gives only 7% of gluten in nee as compared with 22% in the finest wheat, 14 in oats and 12 in maize. The percentage of potash in the ash is as 18 to 23 in wheat. The fatty matter is also less in proportion than in other cereals. Rice, therefore, is chiefly a farinaceous food, and requires to be combined with fatty and nitrogenous substances, such as milk or meat gravy, to satisfy the requirements of the system.</p><p>A large proportion of the rice brought to Europe is used for starch-making, and some is taken by distillers of alcohol. Rice is also -the source of a drinking spirit in India, known as arrack, and the national beverage of Japan—saké—-is prepared from the grain by means of an organic ferment.</p><p>RICE PAPER. The substance' which has received this name in Europe, through the mistaken notion that it is made from rice, consists of the pith of a small tree, <hi rend="italic">Aralia papyrifera, </hi>which grows in thc swampy forests of Formosa. The cylindrical core of pith is rolled on a hard flat surface against a knife, by which it is cut into thin sheets of a fine iVory-ljke texture. Dyed in various colours, rice paper is extensively used for the preparation of artificial flowers, while the white sheets are employed by native artists for water-colour drawings.</p><p><hi rend="bold">RICH, BARNABE </hi>(c. 1540-1617), English author and soldier, was a distant relative of Lord Chancellor Rich. He fought in the Low Countries, rising to the rank of captain, and afterwards served in Ireland. He shared in the colonization of Ulster, and spent the latter part of his life near Dublin. In the intervals of his campaigns he produced many pamphlets on political questions and romances. In 1606 he was in receipt of a pension of half a crown a day, and in 1616 he was presented with a gift of £100 as being the oldest captain in the service. He died on the roth of November 1617. Hjp best-known work is <hi rend="italic">Riche his Farewell to Militarie Profession Conteining verie pleasauni discourses fit for a peaceable tyme</hi>  (1581). Of the eight stories contained in it, five, he says, “ are forged only for delight, neither credible to be believed, nor hurtful to be perused.” The three others are translations from the Italian. He claims as his own invention the story of <hi rend="italic">Apolonius and Silla<hi rend="sub">9</hi></hi>  the second in the collection, from which Shakespeare took the plot of <hi rend="italic">Twelfth Night.</hi>  It is, however, founded on the tale of Nicuola and Lattantio as told by Matteo Bandello. The eighth, <hi rend="italic">Phylotus and Emilia,</hi>  a complicated story arising from the likeness and disguise of a brother and sister, is identical in plot with the anonymous play, <hi rend="italic">Philotus<hi rend="sub">1</hi></hi>  printed in Edinburgh in 1603. Both play and story were edited for the Bannatjme Club in 1835. In the conclusion to his collection Rich tells a story of a devil named Balthaser, who posscsses a king of Scots, prudently changed after the accession of James I. to the “ Grand Turk.” The <hi rend="italic">Strange and Wotiderful Adventures of Don Simonides</hi>  (1581), with its sequel (1584), is written in imitation of Lyly. Among his -other romances should be mentioned <hi rend="italic">The Adventures of Brusanus, prince of Hungaria</hi>  (1592). His authenticated works number twenty-four, and include works on Ireland, the troubles of which were, according to him, due to the religion of the people and to the lack of consistency and firmness on the part of the English government. Such are: <hi rend="italic">Allarme to England </hi>(1578); <hi rend="italic">A New Description of Irelatui</hi>  (1610); <hi rend="italic">The Irish Hubbub, or the English Hue and Crie</hi>  (1617), in which he also inveighs against the use of tobacco.</p><p>See “ Introduction to the Shakespeare Society’s reprint οΐ <hi rend="italic">Riche his Farewell</hi>  (1846); P.
