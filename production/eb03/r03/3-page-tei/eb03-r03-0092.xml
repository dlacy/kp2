From the abilities and haughty temper of this lord, the Livonian knights apprehended that they had reaſon to fear the ſame fate which had befallen the Teutonic order in Pruſſia ; and the ffep itſelf was, beſides, unprecedented, and contrary to the eſtabliſhed laws of the count!y. Theſe diſcontents were heightened by letters ſaid to be intercepted from the archbiſhop to his brother Albert duke of Pruſſia, inviting this laſt totally to ſuppreſs the order of Livonian knights, and to ſecularize their poſſeſſions, eſpecially in Finland ; ſo that an open war broke out among the contending parties, and the archbiſhop was ſeized and made priſoner. He was, however, ſoon releaſed through the mediation of the emperor of Germany and other potentates, backed by the powerful preparations of the Pruſſians to avenge his cauſe ; but in the mean time, the ſtrength of their country being totally exhauſted, the Livonians were obliged, inſtead of preparing for war, to ſue to the Czar ſor peace. Baſilovitz replied, that he did not believe their intentions to be ſincere while they kept 6ooo Germans in pay ; and therefore, if they meant to treat of peace, they muſt begin with diſrniſſing theſe troops. The Livonians, having no longer any power to reſiſt, did as they were ordered ; but it availed them nothing. In 1558 an army of 100,000 Ruffians entered the diſtrict of Dorpt, and laid every thing waſte before them with the moſt ſhocking cruelty. Aſter this they entered the territories of Riga, where they behaved with equal inhumanity ; and ſhaving at laſt ſatiated themſelves with blood and treaſure, they retired with an immenſe booty and a great number of priſoners.</p><p>The Livonians, now thoroughly convinced of their own folly in expofing themſelves to the reſentment of the exaſperated Ruffians, ſent ambaſſadors to ſue for peace in good earnel⅛. Theſe offered the Czar a preſent oſ 30,00Θ ducats, and prevailed upon him to grant their nation a truce for four months, during which they returned home to get the money. But in this interval the Livonian governor of the city of Nerva, out of an idle frolic, fired ſome cannon againſt Ivanogorod or Ruſſian Nerva, ſituated on the oppoſite fide of the river, and killed ſeveral of the Czar’s ſubjects who were aſſembled in an open place quite unarmed. The Ruffians, out of regard to the truce, did not even attempt to make repriſals ; but immediately acquainted Baſilovitz with what had happened : which ſo incenſed the Czar, that when the Livonian ambaſſadors arrived, he told them, he looked upon their nation to be a ſet of perjured wretches, who had renounced all honeſty; that they might go back with their money and propoſals, and let their countrymen know that his vengeance would ſoon overtake them.</p><p>The ambaſſadors were ſcarce arrived in Livonia, when an army of 300,000 Ruffians entered the diſtrict of Ner-va, under the command of Peter Siſegaledrii, who had been a famous pirate in the Euxi∏e ſea. He took the city of Nerva in nine days, and very ſpeedily made himſelf maſter oſ Dorpt, where he found immenſe treaſures. Several other garriſons, terrified by the approach of ſuch numbers, quitted their poſts ; ſo that the Ruffians became maſters of a great part of Livonia almoſt without oppoſition. At laſt, Gothard Kettler, grand-maſter of the knights of Livonia, intreated Chriſtian III. king of Denmark to take Riga, Revel, and the countries of Garnland, Wirrland, and Eſthonia, under his protection ; but the advanced age of that monarch, the diſtance of the places, and the want of ſuſſicient power to withſtand ſo potent an adversary, made him decline the offer. However, he aſſiſted them with ſome money and powder, of which they ſtood greatly in need. Having then applied, without ſucceſs, firſt to the emperor of Germany, and then to the court of Sweden, Kettler put himſelf under the protection of the Poles, who had hitherto been ſuch formidable enemies to the Ruffians. In the mean time the latter purfued their conqueſts ; they took the city of Marienburg, laid waſte the diſtrict of Riga, deſtroyed Garnland, and penetrated to the very gates of Revel. Felin, in which was the beſt artillery of the whole country, became theirs by the treachery of its garriſon ; and here William of Furſtenberg the old grand-maſter was taken, and ended his days in a priſon at Moſcow. The diſtracted ſituation of the Livonian affairs now induced the biſhop of Oeſel to ſell his biſhopric to Ferdinand king of Denmark, who exchanged it with his brother Magnus for a part of Hol-ſtein. The diſtricts of Reval and Eſthonia put themſelves under the protection of Sweden ; and then the grand-maſter, finding himſelf deſerted on all ſides, ſup-preſſed the order of which he was the chief, and accepted of the duchy of Courland, which he held as a fief of the crown of Poland.</p><p>The Czar ſaw with pleaſure the diviſion of Livonia between the Swedes and Poles, which, he rightly judged, would produce quarrels between the two nations, and thus give him the fairer opportunity of ſeizing the whole to himſelf. Accordingly, in 1564, the Swedes offered him their aſſiſtance againſt the Poles ; but he, judging himſelf to be ſuſſiciently ſtrong without them, attacked the Poles with his own forces, and w<hi rend="sup">,</hi>as twice defeated, which checked his farther operations in Livonia. In 1569 he entered into a treaty of commerce with England, captain Richard Chancellor having a ſhort time before diſeovered a paſſage to Archangel in Ruſſia through the White Sea, by which that empire Was likely to be ſupplied with foreign goods, without the aſſiſtance either of Poland or Livonia. To the diſcoverers of this new paſſage Baſilovitz granted many excluſive privileges ; and after the death of queen -Mary renewed the alliance with queen Elizabeth, and wſhich has been continued without interruption ever ſince.</p><p>In the mean time, however, a prodigious army of Turks and 'Partais entered Muſcovy, with a deſign to ſubdue the whole country. But Zerebrinov, the Czar’s general, having attacked them in a defile,. put them to flight with ∙conliderable daughter. Then they retired towards the mouth of the Volga, where they expected a conſiderable reinforcement ; but being cloſely purſued by the Ruffians and Tartars in alliance with them, they were agai-n defeated and forced to fly towards Azov on the Black Sea. But when they came there, they found the city almoſt entirely ruined by the blowing up of a powder magazine. The Ruffians then attacked their ſhips there, took ſome, and ſunk the reſt ; by which means almoſt the whole army periſhed with hunger or the ſword of the enemy.</p><p>From this time the empire oſ Ruſſia became ſo for-</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
