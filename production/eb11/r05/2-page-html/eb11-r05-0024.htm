It&nbsp;is a melancholy reflection that M. de Sévilly, whom his wife&nbsp;and Marie Antoinette combined to surprise with this </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">chef-d’œuvre,</span><span class="font0"> was guillotined, and that his wife, whose sitting-room&nbsp;it was, was condemned to die with him and with Madame&nbsp;Élisabeth de France, whom they had befriended, but was saved,&nbsp;against her will, by the princess, who made a false declaration&nbsp;as to her condition. She had two subsequent husbands, and&nbsp;lost them both in little more than two years. She herself lived&nbsp;less than five years after her delivery by the fall of Robespierre.&nbsp;There is no information as to Rousseau’s later life.

<p><span class="font0">ROUSSILLON, one of the old provinces of France. It now forms the greater part of the department of Pyrénées&nbsp;Orientales </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font0"> It was bounded S. by the Pyrenees, W. by the&nbsp;county of Foix, N. by Languedoc and E. by the Mediterranean.&nbsp;The province derived its name from a small place near Perpignan, the capital, called Ruscino (Rosceliona, Castel Rossello),&nbsp;where the Gallic chieftains met to consider Hannibal’s request&nbsp;for a conference. The district formed part of the Roman&nbsp;province of Gallia Narbonensis from 121 b.c. to a.d. 462, when&nbsp;it was ceded with the rest of Septimania to Theodoric II., king&nbsp;of the Visigoths. His successor, Amalaric, on his defeat by&nbsp;Clovis in 531 retired to Spain, leaving a governor in Septimania.&nbsp;In 719 the Saracens crossed the Pyrenees, and Septimania was&nbsp;held by them until their defeat by Pippin in 756. On the&nbsp;invasion of Spain by Charlemagne in 778 he found the borderlands wasted by the Saracenic wars, and the inhabitants hiding&nbsp;among the mountains. He accordingly made grants of land&nbsp;to Visigothic refugees from Spain, and founded several monasteries, round which the people gathered for protection. In&nbsp;792 the Saracens again invaded France, but were repulsed by&nbsp;Louis,king of Aquitaine,whose rule extended overall Catalonia&nbsp;as far as Barcelona. The different portions of his kingdom in&nbsp;time grew into allodial fiefs, and in 893 Suniaire II. became the&nbsp;first hereditary count of Roussillon. But his rule only extended&nbsp;over the eastern part of what became the later province. The&nbsp;western part, or Cerdagne, was ruled in 900 by Miron as first&nbsp;count, and one of his grandsons, Bernard, was the first hereditary count of the middle portion, or Bésalu. In mi Raymond-Bérenger III., count of Barcelona, inherited the fief of Bésalu,&nbsp;to which was added in 1117 that of Cerdagne; and in 1172 his&nbsp;grandson, Alfonso II., king of Aragon, united Roussillon to his&nbsp;other states on the death of the last count, Gerard II. The counts&nbsp;of Roussillon, Cerdagne and Bésalu were not sufficiently powerful&nbsp;to indulge in any wars of ambition. Their energies had been&nbsp;devoted to furthering the welfare of their people. Under the&nbsp;Aragonese monarchs the progress of the united province still continued, and Collioure, the port of Perpignan, became a centre of&nbsp;Mediterranean trade. But the country was destined to pay the&nbsp;penalty of its position on the frontiers of France and Spain&nbsp;in the long struggle for ascendancy between these two powers.&nbsp;By the treaty of Corbeil (1258) Louis IX. surrendered the sovereignty of Roussillon and the ancient countship of Barcelona to&nbsp;Aragon, and from that time until the 17th century the province&nbsp;ceased to belong to France. James I. of Aragon had wrested&nbsp;the Balearic Isles from the Moors and left them with Roussillon&nbsp;to his son James (1276), with the title of king of Majorca.&nbsp;The consequent disputes of this monarch with his brother&nbsp;Pedro III. of Aragon were not lost sight of by Philip III. of&nbsp;France in his quarrel with the latter about the crown of the&nbsp;Two Sicilies. Philip espoused James’s cause and led his army&nbsp;into Spain, but retreating died at Perpignan in 1285. James&nbsp;then became reconciled to his brother, and in 1311 was succeeded by his son Sancho, who founded the cathedral of Perpignan shortly before his death in 1324. His successor James II.&nbsp;refused to do homage to Philip VI. of France for the seigniory&nbsp;of Montpellier, and applied to Pedro IV. of Aragon for aid.&nbsp;Pedro not only refused it, but on various pretexts declared war&nbsp;against him, and seized Majorca and Roussillon in 1J44. The&nbsp;province was now again united to Aragon, and enjoyed peace&nbsp;until 1462. In this year the disputes between John II. and&nbsp;his son about the crown of Navarre gave Louis XI. of France&nbsp;an excuse to support John against his subjects, who had risen&nbsp;in revolt. Louis turned traitor, and the province having been&nbsp;pawned to him for 300,000 crowns, was occupied by the French&nbsp;troops until 1493, when Charles VIII. restored it to Ferdinand&nbsp;and Isabella. During the war between France and Spain&nbsp;(1496-98) the people suffered equally from the Spanish garrisons&nbsp;and the French invaders. But dislike of the Spaniards was&nbsp;soon effaced in the pride of sharing in the glory of Charles V.,&nbsp;and in 1542, when Perpignan was besieged by the dauphin,&nbsp;the Roussillonnais remained true to their allegiance. Afterwards the decay of Spain was France’s opportunity, andon&nbsp;the revolt of the Catalans against the Castilians in 1641,&nbsp;Louis XIII. espoused the cause of the former, and the treaty&nbsp;of the Pyrenees in-1659 secured Roussillon to the French crown.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROUTH, EDWARD JOHN (1831-1907), English mathematician, was born at Quebec on the 20th of January 1831. At the age of eleven he came to England, and after studying&nbsp;under A. de Morgan at University College, London, entered&nbsp;Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1851. In the mathematical tripos&nbsp;three years later he was senior wrangler, beating J. Clerk&nbsp;Maxwell, who, however, tied with him for the Smith’s prize.&nbsp;Elected a fellow of his college, he devoted himself to teaching,&nbsp;and quickly proved himself one of the most successful mathematical “ coaches ” ever known at Cambridge. In thirty&nbsp;years, of some 700 pupils who passed through his hands 500&nbsp;became wranglers; and for twenty-two successive years, from&nbsp;1861 to 1882, the senior wrangler was trained by him. He&nbsp;made considerable contributions to scientific literature, and&nbsp;among his publications were: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">An Analytical View of Newton’s&nbsp;Principia,</span><span class="font0"> with Lord Brougham (1855); an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Essay on the Stability of a given State of Motion,</span><span class="font0"> which won the Adams’ prize&nbsp;in 1877; and treatises on the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dynamics of Rigid Bodies,</span><span class="font0"> on&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Analytical Statics,</span><span class="font0"> and on the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dynamics of a Particle.</span><span class="font0"> He&nbsp;died at Cambridge on the 7th of June 1907.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROUTLEDGE, GEORGE (1812-1888), English publisher, was bom at Brampton in Cumberland on the 23rd of September&nbsp;1812. He gained his earliest experience of business with a&nbsp;bookseller at Carlisle. Proceeding to London in 1833, he&nbsp;started in business for himself as a bookseller in 1836, and as&nbsp;a publisher in 1843, making his first serious success by reprinting the Biblical commentaries of an American writer, Albert&nbsp;Barnes. His fame as a publisher, however, rests chiefly upon&nbsp;the enormous number of cheap books which he issued. A&nbsp;series of shilling volumes called the “ Railway Library ” was&nbsp;an immense success, including as it did Mrs Harriet Beecher&nbsp;Stowe’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Uncle Tom’s Cabin,</span><span class="font0"> and he also published in popular</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
