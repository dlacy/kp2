<p><span class="font1">estuary. The scouring current predominates at one time in one part and at another time elsewhere, so that slack&nbsp;water is never permanent in any part of the estuary, and&nbsp;accretion cannot progress for a long period without disturbance. When, however, a channel is permanently fixed&nbsp;by training walls, the condition of the estuary is completely transformed. The flood tide, indeed, comes in with&nbsp;its burden of silt as before, rising sooner up the improved&nbsp;channel, and therefore dispersing with a somewhat gentler&nbsp;flow over the rest of the estuary. The ebb tide, however,&nbsp;is mainly concentrated along the trained channel, especially when it attains its maximum scouring efficiency&nbsp;towards low water. Accordingly, whilst the flow in the&nbsp;trained channel is increased, stagnation occurs more or&nbsp;less over the rest of the estuary, and silting-up inevitably&nbsp;occurs, resulting eventually in a large reduction of tidal&nbsp;capacity. The accretion, moreover, is not confined to the&nbsp;portion of the estuary behind the training walls, but&nbsp;gradually creeps down, on each side of the estuary, for a&nbsp;considerable distance beyond the ends of the walls. Low&nbsp;training walls hardly rising above the adjacent sandbanks&nbsp;have been tried with the object of preventing this accretion, but the improved flow in the trained channel and&nbsp;the reduced velocity elsewhere still promote accretion&nbsp;behind the low walls, and the deposit, rising first along&nbsp;the shores of the estuary, gradually attains high-water&nbsp;level over a great portion of the area at the back of the&nbsp;training walls, and from thence slopes down to the top of&nbsp;the walls on each side of the channel. Though the process of accretion is less rapid with low training walls, the&nbsp;ultimate result is only delayed and not prevented, as&nbsp;clearly manifested by observations on the Seine and other&nbsp;rivers, so that the view formerly entertained by some&nbsp;engineers, that if training walls were kept down to the&nbsp;level of the existing sandbanks no accretion would take&nbsp;place, has been proved to be erroneous by the results of&nbsp;experience ; and it may be accepted as a general law that&nbsp;training walls, whether high or low, inevitably lead to&nbsp;accretion if the flood tide is charged with silt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The most careful consideration should be given to all the conditions of an estuary before training works are&nbsp;commenced, for when once begun they must be eventually&nbsp;carried out to deep water ; and, if ports exist along the&nbsp;shores of the estuary, they are liable to be injured by the&nbsp;accretion resulting from the works unless the trained&nbsp;channel can be led close along them. The training works&nbsp;of the Seine estuary, though very advantageous to the&nbsp;inland port of Rouen, are compromising the approach&nbsp;channels to Honfleur and Havre, and have silted up the&nbsp;port of Harfleur, so that the extension of the training&nbsp;walls to Honfleur has been urged in the interests of that&nbsp;port, whilst large works have been executed to preserve&nbsp;its entrance, and a new direct channel into the sea is being&nbsp;proposed for Havre. Though the training works on the&nbsp;Dee have not been carried out hitherto in a judicious&nbsp;direction, having been formed mainly with a view to land&nbsp;reclamation, it would be advantageous for the ports of&nbsp;Chester and Connah’s Quay to extend these works towards&nbsp;the sea, as there are no ports below the present limits of&nbsp;the training walls to be injured by the effects of their prolongation, and the navigable channel would be much&nbsp;improved, provided the works were carried out to deep&nbsp;water. The training walls in the Ribble estuary must&nbsp;eventually be extended, even beyond the limits at present&nbsp;authorized, if a good navigable channel is to be secured to&nbsp;Preston, but these works will produce an entire transformation in the estuary, of which large portions have&nbsp;been already reclaimed as a consequence of the works&nbsp;already accomplished. The Mersey estuary would need a&nbsp;very comprehensive scheme for its improvement, owing to&nbsp;the very defective natural condition of the estuary, and&nbsp;the situation of the ports along its banks. The mere&nbsp;training of the channel in the upper estuary, for the benefit of the up-river ports, would result in the reclamation&nbsp;of the wide estuary between Runcorn and Liverpool, and&nbsp;thus deprive the channels between Liverpool and the sea&nbsp;of their natural scouring reservoir of tidal water ; whilst&nbsp;the training of a channel below Liverpool out to the bar&nbsp;would necessitate very extensive works in deep water and&nbsp;in an exposed situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dredging.—</span><span class="font1">The improvements effected within recent years in the ordinary dredging machinery, and the introduction of the sand-pump dredger, have facilitated and&nbsp;cheapened dredging operations to such an extent that&nbsp;some of the most remarkable river improvements have&nbsp;been effected by dredging. The great increase in depth&nbsp;realized on the Tyne and the Clyde has been effected by&nbsp;means of steam bucket-dredgers aided by hopper barges,&nbsp;whilst the maintenance of the entrance channel to St&nbsp;Nazaire on the Loire, and the deepening of the approaches&nbsp;to Dunkirk and Calais, have been accomplished by sand&nbsp;pumps, which have the advantage of being able to work&nbsp;when exposed to moderate waves. Dredging merely consists in removing material from the river bed and thus&nbsp;enlarging and deepening it ; and the extent to which this&nbsp;method of improvement may be carried simply depends&nbsp;upon the economical consideration as to how far the&nbsp;improvement of the traffic on the river by an increase of&nbsp;depth will afford an adequate return for the outlay.&nbsp;Dredging, however, furnishes a cheap method of excavation owing to the small cost of carriage by water. Dredging, being a purely artificial means of improvement,&nbsp;generally necessitates regular maintenance ; whereas the&nbsp;improvement from scour effected by jetties and training&nbsp;walls is permanent, being realized by natural means.&nbsp;Frequently, however, training walls and jetties are supplemented by dredging, for the walls and jetties render the&nbsp;deepening by dredging easier and more permanent ; whilst,&nbsp;on the other hand, dredging enables a greater depth to&nbsp;be attained, and even maintained, than could have been&nbsp;effected by scour alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The improvements on the Tyne and on the Clyde have mainly resulted from very extensive dredging operations,&nbsp;but they have been aided by training walls on the Clyde,&nbsp;and by the Tynemouth piers on the Tyne, which protect&nbsp;the entrance channel from drift and the dredgers from&nbsp;waves, and concentrate the scour over the bar. The three&nbsp;methods of improvement described above have been resorted to on the Tees : for training walls have been formed&nbsp;through the wide estuary below Middlesborough for fixing&nbsp;the channel ; converging jetties are being constructed for&nbsp;sheltering the channel from wave-borne sand, and for&nbsp;directing the scour over the bar ; and dredging is being&nbsp;employed for deepening the trained and sheltered channel.&nbsp;On the Maas also, and at Charleston, dredging is being&nbsp;used for attaining a depth for navigation which the jetties&nbsp;alone were unable to produce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">River Tyne Improvement Works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Tyne lias a drainage area of 1053 square miles ; its tidal flow extends 18 miles from its mouth, and the range of spring&nbsp;tides at its outlet is 14∣ feet. Being by nature a small winding&nbsp;irregular river, with little tidal capacity and no estuary, its depth&nbsp;was small and variable, and a bar existed at its mouth, which opens&nbsp;directly on to the sea-coast. The first improvement works, commenced in 1843, consisted in training the river by cross jetties,&nbsp;subsequently connected by low training walls, so as to regulate the&nbsp;width an∣l consequently the depth of the river. Λs, however, the&nbsp;volume of water in the river was small, the scour was not adequate&nbsp;to effect a great improvement in the depth ; the bed of the river&nbsp;between Newcastle and the sea, in 1860, was in many places above&nbsp;low-water level ; and the depth on the bar at low tide was only 6&nbsp;feet (fig. 9). The piers at the mouth were commenced in 1856,</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
