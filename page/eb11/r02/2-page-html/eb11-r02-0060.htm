<p><span class="font1">1453· Renq had the confidence of Charles VII., and is said to have initiated the reduction of the men-at-arms set on foot by&nbsp;the king, with whose military operations against the English&nbsp;he was closely associated. He entered Rouen with him in&nbsp;November 1449, and was also with him at Formigny and Caen.&nbsp;After his second marriage with Jeanne de Laval, daughter&nbsp;of Guy XIV., count of Laval, and Isabel of Brittany, René took&nbsp;a less active part in public affairs, and devoted himself more to&nbsp;artistic and literary pursuits. The fortunes of his house declined&nbsp;in his old age. The duke of Calabria, after repeated misfortunes&nbsp;in Italy, was offered the crown of Aragon in 1467, but died,&nbsp;apparently by poison, at Barcelona on the 16th of December&nbsp;1470; the duke’s eldest son Nicholas perished in 1473, also&nbsp;under suspicion of poisoning; René’s daughter Margaret was&nbsp;a refugee from England, her son Prince Edward was murdered&nbsp;in i47r, and she herself became a prisoner, to be rescued by&nbsp;Louis XI. in 1476. His only surviving male descendant was&nbsp;then René II., duke of Lorraine, son of his daughter Yolande,&nbsp;comtesse de Vaudémont, who was gained over to the party&nbsp;of Louis XI., who suspected the king of Sicily of complicity&nbsp;with his enemies, the duke of Brittany and the Constable Saint-Pol. René retired to Provence, and in 1474 made a will by&nbsp;which he left Bar to his grandson René II., duke of Lorraine;&nbsp;Anjou and Provence to his nephew Charles, count of Le Maine.&nbsp;Louis seized Anjou and Bar, and two years later sought to&nbsp;compel the king of Sicily to exchange the two duchies for&nbsp;a pension. The offer was rejected, but further negotiations&nbsp;assured the lapse to the crown of the duchy of Anjou, and the&nbsp;annexation of Provence was only postponed until the death&nbsp;of the count of Le Maine. René died on the 10th of July 1480,&nbsp;his charities having earned for him the title of “ the good.”&nbsp;He founded an order of chivalry, the Ordre du Croissant, which&nbsp;was anterior to the royal foundation of St Michael, but did not&nbsp;survive René.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The king of Sicily’s fame as an amateur of painting has led to the attribution to him of many old paintings in Anjou&nbsp;and Provence, in many cases simply because they bear his&nbsp;arms. These works are generally in the Flemish style, and&nbsp;were probably executed under his patronage and direction, so&nbsp;that he may be said to have formed a school of the fine arts&nbsp;in sculpture, painting, gold work and tapestry. Two of the&nbsp;most famous works formerly attributed to René are the triptych,&nbsp;the “ Burning Bush,” in the cathedral of Aix, showing portraits&nbsp;of René and his second wife, Jeanne de Laval, and an illuminated Book of Hours in the Bibliothèque nationale, Paris. The&nbsp;“ Burning Bush ” was in fact the work of Nicolas Froment, a&nbsp;painter of Avignon. Among the men of letters attached to his&nbsp;court was Antoine de la Sale, whom he made tutor to his son,&nbsp;the duke of Calabria. He encouraged the performance of&nbsp;mystery plays; on the performance of a mystery of the Passion&nbsp;at Saumur in 1462 he remitted four years of taxes to the&nbsp;town, and the representations of the Passion at Angers were&nbsp;carried out under his auspices. He exchanged verses with his&nbsp;kinsman, the poet Charles of Orleans. The best of his poems&nbsp;is the idyl of Regnault and Jeanneton, representing his own&nbsp;courtship of Jeanne de Laval. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Le Livre des tournois,</span><span class="font1"> a book&nbsp;of ceremonial, and the allegorical romance, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Conqueste qPun&nbsp;chevalier nommé le Cuer Pamour espris feist Pnne dame appelée&nbsp;Doulce Mercy,</span><span class="font1"> with other works ascribed to him, were perhaps&nbsp;dictated to his secretaries, or at least compiled under his direction.

<p><span class="font1">RENÉE OF FRANCE (1510-1575), second daughter *of Louis XII. and Anne of Brittany, was born at Blois on the 25th&nbsp;of October 1510. After being betrothed successively to Gaston&nbsp;de Foix, Charles of Austria (the future emperor Charles V.),&nbsp;his brother Ferdinand, Henry VIII. of England, and the&nbsp;elector Joachim II. of Brandenburg, she married in 1528</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hercules of Este, son of thc duke of Ferrara, who succeeded his father six years later. Rcnée’s court became a rendezvous of&nbsp;men of letters and a refuge for the persecuted French Calvinists.&nbsp;She received Clément Marot and<sup>x</sup>Calvin at her court, and&nbsp;finally embraced the reformed religion. Her husband, however,&nbsp;who viewed these proceedings with disfavour, banished her&nbsp;friends, took her children from her, threw her into prison,&nbsp;and eventually made her abandon at any rate the outward&nbsp;forms of Calvinism. After his death in 1559, Renée returned&nbsp;to France and turned her duchy of Montargis into a centre of&nbsp;Protestant propaganda. During the wars of religion she was&nbsp;several times molested by the Catholic troops, and in 1562 her&nbsp;château was besieged by her son-in-law, thc duke of Guise.&nbsp;She died at Montargis.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">at Lausanne on the 26th of March 1831. In 1857 he became professor of geology and palaeontology in the university at&nbsp;Lausanne. He is distinguished for bis researches on the geology&nbsp;and palaeontology of the Alps, on which subjects he published&nbsp;numerous papers in the proceedings of the scientific societies in&nbsp;Switzerland and France. With F. J. Pictet he wrote a memoir&nbsp;on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fossiles du terrain aptien de la Perle-du-Rhone</span><span class="font1"> (1854).&nbsp;In 1894 he was appointed president of the Swiss Geological&nbsp;Commission, and also of the International Geological Congress&nbsp;held^that year at Zürich, in the previous meetings of which he had&nbsp;taken a prominent part. He published a noteworthy </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tableau&nbsp;des terrains Scdimentaircs</span><span class="font1"> (1874); and a second more elaborate&nbsp;edition, accompanied by an explanatory article </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chronographe&nbsp;géologique,</span><span class="font1"> was issued in 1897 as a supplement to the Report of&nbsp;the Zurich Congress.

<p><span class="font1">RENFREW, a royal, municipal and police burgh and county town of Renfrewshire, Scotland, near the southern bank of the&nbsp;Clyde, 7 m. W. by N. of Glasgow, via Cardonald, by the Glasgow&nbsp;&amp; South-Western and Caledonian railways (5 m. by road).&nbsp;Pop. (1891) 6777; (1901) 9296. Industries include shipbuilding (the construction of dredgers and floating docks is a&nbsp;speciality), engineering, dyeing, weaving, chemicals and cabinetmaking. The Clyde trust has constructed a large dock here.&nbsp;Renfrew belongs to the Kilmarnock district group of parliamentary burghs (with Kilmarnock, Dumbarton, Rutherglen&nbsp;and Port Glasgow). Robert III. gave a charter in 1396, but it&nbsp;was a burgh (Renifry) at least 250 years earlier. About 1160&nbsp;Walter Fitzalan, the first high steward of Scotland, built a castle&nbsp;on an eminence by the side of the Clyde (still called Castle Hill),&nbsp;the original seat of the royal house of Stewart. Close to the&nbsp;town, on the site of Elderslie House, Somerled, lord of the&nbsp;Isles, was defeated and slain in 1164 by the forces of Malcolm IV.,&nbsp;against whom he had rebelled. In 1404 Robert II. bestowed&nbsp;upon his son James (afterwards James I.) the title of Baron of&nbsp;Renfrew, still borne by the prince of Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RENFREWSHIRE, a south-western county of Scotland, bounded N. by the river and firth of Clyde, E. by Lanarkshire,&nbsp;S. and S.W. by Ayrshire and W. by the firth of Clyde. A small&nbsp;detached portion of the parish of Renfrew, situated on the&nbsp;northern bank of the Clyde, is surrounded on the landward side&nbsp;by Dumbartonshire. Thecounty has an area of 153,332 acres,&nbsp;or 239-6 sq. m. Excepting towards the Ayrshire border on the&nbsp;south-west, where the principal heights are Hill of Stake (1711 ft.),&nbsp;East Girt Hill (1673), Misty Law (1663) and Creuch Hill (1446),&nbsp;and the confine^ of Lanarkshire on the south-east, where a few&nbsp;points attain an altitude of 1200 ft.—the surface is undulating&nbsp;rather than rugged. Much of the higher land in the centre is&nbsp;well wooded. The Clyde forms part of the northern boundary&nbsp;of the shire. In the N.W. Loch Thom and Gryfe Reservoir&nbsp;provide Greenock with water, and Balgray Reservoir and Glen&nbsp;Reservoir reinforce the water-supply of a portion of the Glasgow&nbsp;area.
