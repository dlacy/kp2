<p><span class="font0">places, which only themſelves could endure. In this manner the Goths, Sarmatians, Alani. Quadi, &amp;c. poured down in incredible numbers ; while every defeat&nbsp;ſeemed but to increaſe their ſtrength and perſeverance.&nbsp;Of theſe, multitudes were taken priſoners, and ſent to&nbsp;people the more ſouthern parts of the empire ; ſtill&nbsp;greater numbers were deſtroyed ; and though the reſt&nbsp;were driven back to their native foreſts, yet they continued ever mindful of then· inveterate enmity, and, like a&nbsp;ſavage beaſt, only continued inactive, till they had licked their wounds for â new encounter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During this interval, as if the external miſeries of the empire were not ſufficient, the tenth and laſt great perſecution was renewed againſt the Chriſtians. This is&nbsp;ſaid to have exceeded all the former in ſeverity : and&nbsp;ſuch was the zeal with which it was purſued, that, in&nbsp;an ancient inſcription, we are unformed that they had&nbsp;effaced the name and ſuperſtition of the Chriſtians, and&nbsp;had reſtored and propagated the worſhip of the gods.&nbsp;Their attempts, however, were but the malicious efforts&nbsp;of an expiring party ; for Chriſtianity ſhortly after was&nbsp;eſtabliſhed by law, and triumphed over the malice of all&nbsp;its enemies. In the midſt of the troubles raiſed by this&nbsp;perſecution, and of the conteſts that ſtruck at the internal parts of the ſtate, Diocleſian and Maximian ſurpriſed the world by reſigning their dignities on the ſame&nbsp;day, and both retiring into private ſtations. Hiſtorians&nbsp;are much divided concerning the motives that thus induced them to give up thoſe honours which they had&nbsp;purchaſed with ſo much danger. Some aſeribe it to&nbsp;the philoſophical turn of Diocleſian ; and others, to&nbsp;his being diſguſted with the obſtinacy of his Chriſtian&nbsp;ſubjects : but Lactantius aſſerts, that he was compelled&nbsp;to it, together with his partner, by Galerius, who coming to Nicomedia, upon the emperor’s recovery ſrom&nbsp;a great ſickneſs, threatened him with a civil war in caſe&nbsp;he refuſed to reſign. However, of this we are well aſſured, that he ſtill preſerved a dignity of ſentiment in&nbsp;his retirement, that might induce us to believe he had&nbsp;no other motive for reſignation than the love of quiet,&nbsp;and the conſciouſneſs of his inability to diſeharge on a&nbsp;ſick-bed the duties of a ſovereign. Having retired to his&nbsp;birth-place, he ſpent his time in cultivating his garden,&nbsp;aſſuring his viſitors that then only he began to enjoy&nbsp;the world, when he was thought by the reſt of mankind to forſake it. When alſo ſome attempted to per-fuade him to reſume the empire, he replied, That if&nbsp;they knew his preſent happineſs, they would rather endeavour to imitate than diſturb it. In this contented&nbsp;manner he lived ſome time, and at laſt died either by&nbsp;poiſon of madneſs, it is uncertain which. His reign,&nbsp;which continued 20 years, was active and uſeful ; and&nbsp;his authority, tinctured with ſeverity, was well adapted to the depraved ſtate of morals at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Maximian, his partner in the empire and in reſignation, was by no means ſo contented with his ſituation. He longed once more for power, and diſturbed the two&nbsp;ſucceeding reigns with various efforts to reſume it ; attempting to engage Diocleſian in the ſame deſign.&nbsp;Being obliged to leave Rome, where he had bred great&nbsp;confuſion, he went over into Gaul, where he was kindly received by Conſtantine, the then acknowledged emperor of the weſt. But here alſo continuing his intrigues, and endeavouring to force his own daughter&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and deſtroy her huſband, he was detected, and condemn</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h4><span class="font1">ed to die by whatever death he ſhould think proper *</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">and Lactantius tells us that he choſe hanging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upon the reſignation of the two emperors, the two Cæſars whom they had formerly choſen were univerſally acknowledged as their ſucceſſors. Conſtantius.&nbsp;Chlorus, who was ſo called from the plainneſs of his&nbsp;complexion, was virtuous, valiant, and merciful. Ga-lerius, on the other hand, was brave, but brutal, incontinent, and cruel. As there was ſuch a diſparity in&nbsp;their tempers, they readily agreed, upon coming into&nbsp;full power, to divide the empire ; Conſtantius being appointed to govern the weſtern parts; namely, Italy, Sicily,&nbsp;the greateſt part of Africa, together with Spain, Gaul,&nbsp;Britain, and Germany : Galerius had the eaſtern parte&nbsp;allotted to his ſhare ; to wit, Illyricum, Pannonia,&nbsp;Thrace, Macedonia, all the provinces of Greece, and&nbsp;the Leſſer Aſia, together with Egypt, Syria, Judea,&nbsp;and all the countries eaſtward. The greatneſs of the&nbsp;diviſion, however, ſoon induced the emperors to take in&nbsp;two partners more, Severus and Maximin, who were&nbsp;made Cæſars, and aſſiſted in the conducting of affairs ;&nbsp;ſo that the empire now was under the guidance of four&nbsp;perſons, all inveſted with ſupreme authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We are informed but of few particulars of the reign of Conſtantius, except a detail of his character, which&nbsp;appears in every light moſt amiable. He was frugal,&nbsp;chaſte, and temperate. His mercy and juſtice were&nbsp;equally conſpicuous in his treatment of the Chriſtians,&nbsp;whom he would not ſuffer to be injured ; and when at&nbsp;length perſuaded to diſplace all the Chriſtian officers of&nbsp;his houſehold that would not change their religion,&nbsp;when ſome of them complied he ſent them away in diſgrace ; alleging, that thoſe who were not true to their&nbsp;God, would never be faithful to their prince.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the ſecond year of his reign he went over into Britain ; and leaving his ſon Conſtantine as a kind of&nbsp;hoſtage in the court of his partner in the empire, took&nbsp;up his reſidence at York. He there continued in the&nbsp;practice of his uſual virtues ; till falling ſick, he began&nbsp;to think of appointing his ſon for his ſucceſſor. He&nbsp;accordingly ſent for him with all ſpeed ; but he was&nbsp;paſt recovery before his arrival : notwithſtanding, he received him with marks of the utmoſt affection, and&nbsp;raiſing himſelf in his bed, gave him ſeveral uſeful inſtructions, particularly recommending the Chriſtians to&nbsp;his protection. He then bequeathed the empire to his&nbsp;care ; and crying out, that none but the pious Conſtantine ſhould ſucceed him, he expired in his arms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the mean time, Galerius, his partner in the empire, being informed of Conſtantine’s advancement, teſtified the moſt ungovernable rage, and was even going to condemn the meſſenger who brought him the account :&nbsp;but being diſſuadect, he ſeemed to acquieſce in what he&nbsp;could not prevent, and ſent him the marks of royalty j&nbsp;but at the fame time declared Severus emperor, in op.&nbsp;poſition to his intereſts. Juſt about this time alſo, another pretender to the empire ſtarted up. This was&nbsp;Maxentius, a perſon of mean extraction; but very much&nbsp;favoured by the ſoldiers, whom he permitted to pillage&nbsp;at diſcretion. In order to oppoſe Maxentius, Severus&nbsp;led a numerous army towards the gates of Rome ; but&nbsp;his ſoldiers conſidering againſt whom they were to&nbsp;fight, immediately abandoned him ; and ſhortly after&nbsp;he put an end to his own liſe, by opening his veins.&nbsp;To revenge his death, Galerius </span><span class="font1">marched into </span><span class="font0">Italy, re-</span></p>
