<p><span class="font1">men. Rumania was to remain part of the Ottoman empire within the limits fixed by the capitulations and the treaty of Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first Rumanian ministry formed under the new prince was composed of the leading statesmen of all political parties,&nbsp;care being taken that the two provinces should be&nbsp;equally represented. A new constitution was unanimously passed by the chamber on the nth of July.&nbsp;It provided for an Upper and Lower House of Representatives, and conferred on the prince the right of&nbsp;an absolute and unconditional veto on all legislation. Other&nbsp;reforms were urgently needed. There was an empty treasury,&nbsp;and the floating debt amounted to £7,000,000; maladministration was rampant in every department of the state; the&nbsp;national guard was mutinous, while the small army of regulars&nbsp;was badly organized and inefficient. The existence of famine&nbsp;and cholera added to the difficulties of the government, and&nbsp;in March 1867 the Lower House, by a majority of three, passed&nbsp;the laconic resolution, “ The chamber inflicts a vote of blame&nbsp;on the government. ” As the result of this vote M. Kretzulescu,&nbsp;a Moderate Conservative, was called to the head of affairs, and&nbsp;I. C. Bratianu entered the government as minister of the&nbsp;interior. The new ministry, of which Bratianu was the leading&nbsp;spirit, showed considerable energy: a concession was granted&nbsp;for the construction of the first Rumanian railway, from&nbsp;Bucharest to Giurgevo, and the reorganization of the army was&nbsp;undertaken. Among other less judicious measures, a decree&nbsp;was passed ostensibly directed against all vagabond foreigners,&nbsp;but really aimed at the Jews, large numbers of whom, including&nbsp;many respected landowners and men of business, were imprisoned, or expelled, from Jassy, Bacau and other parts of&nbsp;Moldavia. This harsh treatment created intense indignation&nbsp;abroad, especially in France and Great Britain; and the&nbsp;emperor Napoleon wrote personally to Prince Charles, protesting against the persecution. The country could not afford&nbsp;to lose the goodwill of the emperor of the French, at that time&nbsp;one of the most powerful factors in Europe—in July 1869&nbsp;Bratianu, although immensely popular, found it necessary to</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">resign office, and with him fell the rest of the cabinet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the 15th of September 1869, Prince Charles married Princess Elizabeth of Wied, afterwards celebrated under ber&nbsp;literary name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Carmen Sylva.@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"> </span><span class="font1">In the same year the army&nbsp;was reorganized, and a rural police created. Every able-bodied&nbsp;citizen was rendered liable to give three days’ work yearly&nbsp;towards the construction of roads, or to pay a small tax as an&nbsp;equivalent. An important railway concession, which subsequently caused grave political complications, was granted to&nbsp;the German contractors Strausberg and Offenheim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Much excitement was aroused in Rumania by the outbreak of the war between Prussia and France. The sympathies of&nbsp;the Rumanians were entirely on the side of the French,&nbsp;whom they regarded as a kindred Latin race, while&nbsp;those of the prince were naturally with his native&nbsp;country. The excitement culminated in a revolutionary&nbsp;outbreak at Ploesci, where a hot-headed deputy, Candianu&nbsp;Popescu, after the mob had stormed the militia barracks, issued&nbsp;a proclamation deposing Prince Charles and appointing General&nbsp;Golescu regent. Owing to the loyalty of the regular army&nbsp;the insurrection was speedily quelled. But the feeling in the&nbsp;country was strong against the German sovereign, who seriously&nbsp;thought of abdicating when a jury acquitted the accused rebels.&nbsp;On the 7th of December he wrote confidentially to the sovereigns&nbsp;whose representatives had signed the treaty of Paris, suggesting&nbsp;that the future of Rumania should be regulated by a European</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">congress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A few days subsequently the prince learned that the German railway contractor Strausberg was unwilling or unable to pay&nbsp;the coupons of the railway bonds due on the 1st of&nbsp;January 1871, which were mostly held by influential&nbsp;people in Germany. This threw the responsibility&nbsp;of payment on Rumania, and was a severe blow to the prince,</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1 </sup>For biographical details, see Charles, king of Rumania; and Elizabeth, queen of Rumania.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">through whose instrumentality the loan had been placed. Matters were brought to a crisis by the Prussian government&nbsp;threatening to force the Rumanian government to provide&nbsp;for the unpaid coupons. The country was financially in no&nbsp;condition to comply. Bitter indignation prevailed against&nbsp;everything German, and culminated in an attack on the German&nbsp;colony in Bucharest on the 22nd of March 1871. On the&nbsp;following morning the prince summoned the members of the&nbsp;council of regency of 1866, and informed them of his intention to place the government in their hands. Lascar Catargiu&nbsp;and General Golescu, the only two members present, as well&nbsp;as Dimitrie Sturdza and other influential persons, declined&nbsp;to accept the responsibility. Catargiu offered to unite the&nbsp;different sections of the Conservative party in order to deal&nbsp;with the crisis. The prince accepted his offer. The elections&nbsp;took place early in May 1871, and the government, to which&nbsp;all the most respectable elements in the country had rallied,&nbsp;obtained a large majority. When parliament met in May the&nbsp;prince had a most enthusiastic reception. The anti-German&nbsp;feeling in the country had greatly subsided, in consequence of&nbsp;the crushing defeat of France; and in January 1872 the&nbsp;chambers passed a law by which Rumania undertook to pay&nbsp;the railway coupons. The German syndicate was satisfied,&nbsp;and the railway crisis ended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Catargiu’s ministry was the tenth that had held office in the five years since the prince’s arrival, but it was the first one that&nbsp;was stable. In March 187 </span><span class="font0">s </span><span class="font1">the budget for 1876,&nbsp;amounting to £4,000,000, nearly, double in amount&nbsp;that of the year 1866, was passed without difficulty,&nbsp;and on the 28th of the month the parliamentary&nbsp;session closed. It was the first occasion in Rumania that the&nbsp;same chamber had sat for the whole constitutional period of&nbsp;four years, and also the first time that the same ministry had&nbsp;opened and closed the same parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Only the fall of the Catargiu ministry saved the country from revolution. The leading Liberals had promoted a conspiracy for the arrest and expulsion of the prince, and the&nbsp;formation of a provisional government under General Dabija.&nbsp;The prospect of a return to power put an end to these machinations. Catargiu’s ministry was succeeded by an administration&nbsp;under General Florescu, known as the “cabinet of the generals,”&nbsp;and, a month later, by the so-called “ ministry of conciliation ”&nbsp;under M. Jepureanu. A commission of the chambers drew up an&nbsp;indictment against Catargiu and his late colleagues, accusing&nbsp;them of violating the constitution and the public liberties,&nbsp;squandering the state revenues, and other abuse of power.&nbsp;Unable to stem the tide of popular passion, which was crying for&nbsp;the impeachment of Catargiu, Jepureanu resigned office, and&nbsp;Bratianu formed a new Liberal cabinet, destined to guide the&nbsp;country through many eventful years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But the re-opening of the Eastern Question was destined to bring to a climax the great struggle of Rumania for existence&nbsp;and independence, and temporarily to throw into the&nbsp;shade all domestic questions. The insurrection in&nbsp;Bulgaria, with its accompanying horrors, followed by&nbsp;the deposition of sultan Murad and the succession* of&nbsp;the sultan Abdul Hamid, contributed to indicate the&nbsp;near approach of a Russo-Turkish war. Russia had shown&nbsp;symptoms of anger against Rumania for not having taken up a&nbsp;decided attitude in the approaching struggle, and the Russian&nbsp;ambassador Ignatiev had some months previously threatened&nbsp;that his government would seize Rumania as a pledge as soon&nbsp;as the Turks occupied Servia and Montenegro. Prince Charles&nbsp;decided to send a mission, composed of Bratianu and Colonel&nbsp;Slaniceanu (the minister of war), to the imperial headquarters&nbsp;at Livadia. They were well received by the emperor (October&nbsp;1876), but in spite of mixed threats and cajoleries on the&nbsp;part of Gorchakov, Ignatiev and others, Bratianu returned&nbsp;without having definitively committed his country to active&nbsp;measures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the 14th of November six Russian army corps were mobilized to form the army of the south under the grand duke</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
