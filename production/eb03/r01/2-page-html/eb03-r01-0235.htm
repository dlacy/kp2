<p><span class="font1">Be this as it will, there is no bird ſecures its young better from external injury than the toucan, it has&nbsp;not only birds, men, and ſerpents, to guard againſt ;&nbsp;but a numerous tribe of monkeys, ſtill more prying,&nbsp;miſchievous, and hungry, than all the reſt. The toucan, however, ſceops out its neſt into the hollow of&nbsp;ſome tree, leaving only a hole large enough to go in&nbsp;and out at. There it ſits, with its great beak, guarding the entrance ; and if the monkey ventures to offer&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">viſit of curioſity, the toucan gives him ſueh a wel-come, that he preſently thinks proper to pack off, and&nbsp;is glad to eſcape with ſafety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This bird is only found in the warm climates of South America, where it is in great requeft, both for the de-licacy of its fleſh, which is tender and nouriſhing, and&nbsp;for the beauty of its plumage, particularly the fea-thers of the breaſt. The ſkin of this part the Indians pluck off, and when dry glue to their cheeks ;&nbsp;and this they conſider as an irreſiſtible addition to their&nbsp;beauty.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RHAPSODI, Rhapsodjsts, in antiquity, perſons wlio made a buſineſs of ſinging pieces of Homer’s&nbsp;poems. Cuper informs us, that the Rhapfodi were&nbsp;clothed in red when they ſung the Iliad, and in blue&nbsp;when they ſung tlie Odyffey.. They performed on the&nbsp;theatres, and ſometimes ſtrove for prizes in. conteſts of&nbsp;poetry, ſinging, &amp;c.

<p><span class="font1">RHAPSODOMANCY, an ancient kind oſ divina-tion performed by pitching on a paffage oſ a poet at hazard, and reckoning on it as a prediction oſ what was.&nbsp;to come to paſs. There were various ways oſ practi-fing this rhapſodomaney. Sometimes they wrote ſeveral papers or Sentences oſ a poet on ſo many pieces oſ&nbsp;wood, paper, or the like, ſhcok them together in an&nbsp;urn, and drew out one which was accounted the lot&nbsp;ſometimes they caſt dice on a table whereon verſes were&nbsp;written, and that whereon the die lodged contained the&nbsp;prediction- A third manner was by opening a book,&nbsp;and pitching on ſome verſe at ſirſt ſight.

<p><span class="font1">RHEA AMERlCANA. The American oſtrſch of authors has been frequently mentioned, but till oſ late years very imperfectly known ; being blended by ſome&nbsp;with other genera, although forming oſ itſelſ a diſtinct&nbsp;one, differing in many things from all others. The&nbsp;older writers, however, have kept it ſeparate. It does&nbsp;not occur to us whether any author has figured this&nbsp;bird except </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nieremberg,</span><span class="font1"> whoſe repreſentation conveys&nbsp;no juſt idea, which is wonderful, as it is to be met with&nbsp;iu ſufficient plenty in various parts oſ South America ;&nbsp;nor has the bird itſelſ made its appearance in the cabi-nets oſ coliectors, until the one now in the Leverian&nbsp;muſeum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">M. Bajon, in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mem. fur Cayenne,</span><span class="font1"> gives a ſigure and deſcription oſ the jabirus, and ſeems clear that this&nbsp;bird is no other than the oſtrich oſ Amenca. From&nbsp;this affertion, Mr Latham, in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Synopßs,</span><span class="font1"> leaves the&nbsp;matter undecided ; but this author, in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Index Qmi-thol.</span><span class="font1"> ſrom having met with the ſpecimen above alluded&nbsp;to, and ſupported in an account oſ its manners given by&nbsp;Molina in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hſſl. Nat. da Chili,</span><span class="font1"> treats this matter on&nbsp;more certain grounds, ſo as to enable us to give the following deſcription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In ſize the American oſtrich is very little inferior to the common one : the bill is Hoped not unlike that of&nbsp;a gooſe, being flat on the top and rounded at the end r&nbsp;the eyes are black, and the lids furniſhed with hairs :&nbsp;the head is rounded, and covered with downy feathers :&nbsp;the neck is two feet eight inches long, and feathered&nbsp;alſo : from the tip of one wing to that of the other extended, the length is eight feet ; but from the want of&nbsp;continuity of the webs of the feathers, and their laxity&nbsp;of texture, the bird is unable to raiſe itſelf from the&nbsp;ground \ it is, however, capable of greatly affiſtiug itſelf by their motion in running, which it does very&nbsp;ſwiftly : the legs are ſtout, hare of feathers above the&nbsp;knees, and ſurniſhed with three toes, all placed forwards, each having a ſtraight and ſtout claw as in the&nbsp;caſſowary ; on the heel is a callous knob, ſerving in&nbsp;place of a back, toe : the general colour of plumage is&nbsp;dull grey mixed with white, inclining to the latter on&nbsp;the under parts : the tail is very lhort, and not conſpicuous, being entirely covered with long looſe and floating feathers, having origin from the lower part of the&nbsp;hack and rump, and entirely covering it : the bill and&nbsp;legs are brown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Molina obſerves that this bird varies ; the body in ſome being white, in others black. In reſpect to manners, it is ſaid.to be a general feeder, but more ſond of&nbsp;flies, which it catches with great dexterity, and will alſo, like the common oſtrich, ſwallow bits oſ iron and<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>any other traſh offered to it. In common with the&nbsp;oſtrich of the old world, it lays a number of eggs, from. '&nbsp;40 to 60, in the fand, cacti of them holding a quart ;</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
