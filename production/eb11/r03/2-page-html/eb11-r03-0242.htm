<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Historical Sketch.—</span><span class="font2">Diocletian’s artificial experiment of two Augusti and two Caesars had been proved a failure, leading to&nbsp;twenty years of disastrous civil wars; and when Constantine&nbsp;the Great </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(ç.ï&gt;.)</span><span class="font2"> destroyed his last rival and restored domestic&nbsp;peace, he ruled for the rest of his life with undivided sway.&nbsp;But he had three sons, and this led to a new partition of the&nbsp;Empire after his death, and to more domestic wars, Constans&nbsp;first annexing the share of Constantine II. (340) and becoming&nbsp;sole ruler of the west, to be in turn destroyed by Constantius II.,&nbsp;who in 350 remained sole sovereign of the Empire. Having&nbsp;no children, he was succeeded by his cousin, Julian the Apostate&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(ç.îî.).</span><span class="font2"> This period was marked by wars against the Germans,&nbsp;who were pressing on the Rhine and Danish frontiers, and&nbsp;against Persia. Julian lost his life in the eastern struggle,&nbsp;which was then terminated by a disadvantageous peace. But&nbsp;the German danger grew graver, and the battle of Adrianopde,&nbsp;in which the Visigoths, who had crossed the Danube in consequence of the coming of the Huns (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Goths</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Huns),</span><span class="font2"> won&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">great victory, and the emperor Valens perished (378), announced that the question between Roman and Teuton had&nbsp;entered on a new stage. Theodosius the Great saved the situation for the time by his,Gothic pacification. The efforts of a&nbsp;series of exceptionally able and hard-working rulers preserved&nbsp;the Empire intact throughout the 4th century, but the dangers&nbsp;which they weathered were fatal to their weaker successors.&nbsp;On the death of Theodosius the decisive moment came for the&nbsp;expansion of the Germans, and they took the tide at the flood.&nbsp;There were three elements in the situation. Besides the&nbsp;Teutonic peoples beyond the frontier there were dependent&nbsp;people who had settled within the Empire (as Visigoths in&nbsp;Moesia, Vandals in Pannonia), and further there were the&nbsp;semi-Romanized Germans in the service of the Empire, some&nbsp;of whom had risen to leading positions (like Merobaudes and&nbsp;Stilicho). Λ Germanization of the Empire, or part of it, in&nbsp;some shape was inevitable, but, if the rulers of the 5th century&nbsp;had been men of the same stamp as the rulers of the 4th, the&nbsp;process might have assumed a different form. The sons of&nbsp;Theodosius were both incapable; and in their reigns the future&nbsp;of the state which was divided between them was decided. The&nbsp;dualism between the east (under Arcadius) and the west (under&nbsp;Honorious) developed under the rule of these brothers into&nbsp;antagonism verging on hostility. The German danger was&nbsp;averted in the east, but it led in a few years to the loss of many&nbsp;of the western provinces, and at the end of ninety years the</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2">immediate authority of the Roman Emperor did not extend west of the Adriatic. The reign of Honorius saw the abandonment of Britain, the establishment of the Visigothic kingdom&nbsp;in Aquitaine, the occupation of a great part of Spain by Vandals&nbsp;and Sueves (Suebi). Under Valentinian III. the Vandals&nbsp;founded their kingdom in North Africa, the Visigoths sharcd&nbsp;Spain with the Sueves, the Burgundian kingdom was founded&nbsp;in S.E. Gaul. The last Roman possession in Gaul passed to&nbsp;the Franks in 486 (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Goths; Vandals; Franks).</span><span class="font2"> It is&nbsp;significant that the chief defender of the Empire against the&nbsp;Germans who were dismembering it were men of German race.&nbsp;Stilicho, who defended Italy against Alaric, Aetius, whosc great&nbsp;work was to protect the imperial possessions in Gaul, and&nbsp;Ricimer. It was also a German, Fravitta, who played a decisive&nbsp;part in suppressing a formidable Gothic movement which&nbsp;menaced the throne of Arcadius in 399-400. It was characteristic of this transformation of Europe that the Germans,&nbsp;who were imbued with a profound reverence for the Empire&nbsp;and its prestige, founded their kingdoms on Roman soil in the&nbsp;first instance as “ federates ” of the Emperor, on the basis of&nbsp;formal contracts, defining their relations to the native provincials; they seized their dominions not as conquerors, but&nbsp;as subjects. The double position of Alaric himself, as both&nbsp;king of the Visigoths and a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">magister militum</span><span class="font2"> of the Empire&nbsp;is significant of the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The development of events was complicated by the sudden growth of the transient empire of the Huns (ç.t&gt;.) in central&nbsp;Europe, forming a third great power, which, reaching from the&nbsp;Rhine to the Caucasus, from the Danube to the Baltic, might&nbsp;be compared in the extent of its nominal supremacy, but in&nbsp;nothing else, to the empires of Rome and Persia. The Huns,&nbsp;whose first appearance had precipitated the Germans on the&nbsp;Empire, now retarded for some years the process of German&nbsp;expansion, while they failed in their own attacks upon the&nbsp;Empire. On Attila’s death (453) his realm collapsed, and his&nbsp;German vassals (Ostrogoths, &amp;c.) founded important kingdoms&nbsp;on its ruins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After the death of Valentinian III., the worst of his house, the Theodosian dynasty expired in the west, and the authority&nbsp;of the western emperors who succeeded him in rapid succession&nbsp;reached little beyond Italy. For most of this period of twenty&nbsp;years the general Ricimer, of German birth, held the scales of&nbsp;power in that peninsula, setting up and pulling down emperors.&nbsp;After his death the western throne was no longer tenable.&nbsp;First there was a usurpation; the general Orestes set up his&nbsp;child-son Romulus Augustulus against the legitimate Augustus,&nbsp;Julius Nepos, who was acknowledged by the eastern emperor;&nbsp;but this temporary government was overthrown (476) by a&nbsp;Germanic military revolution headed by Odoacer, who appropriated part of the soil to his. German soldiers and founded an&nbsp;Italian kingdom under the nominal supremacy of the emperor&nbsp;at Constantinople, who, however unwilling, recognized his&nbsp;position (after the death of Julius Nepos).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The escape of the eastern provinces from the fate of the western illustrates the fact that the strength of the Empire&nbsp;lay in the east. These provinces were more populous and&nbsp;presented greater obstacles to the invaders, who followed the&nbsp;line of least resistance. But it was of immense importance&nbsp;that throughout this period the Empire was able to preserve a&nbsp;practically unbroken peace with its great eastern rival. The&nbsp;struggle with Persia, terminated in 364 by the peace of Jovian,&nbsp;was not renewed till the beginning of the 6th century. It was&nbsp;of greater importance that the rulers pursucd a discreet and&nbsp;moderate policy, both in financial administration and in foreign&nbsp;affairs; and the result was that at the end of a hundred years&nbsp;the diminished Empire was strong and consolidated. Theodosius II. was a weak prince, but his government was ably&nbsp;conducted by Anthemius, by his sister Pulcheria and by the&nbsp;eunuch Chrysaphius. His feign was important for the Armenian&nbsp;question. Theodosius I. had committed the error of consenting to a division of this buffer state in the Roman and Persian&nbsp;spheres of influence, Persia having much the larger.
