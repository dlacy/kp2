SUE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Joseph Marie</hi> (1804-1859), generally known as</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Eugène Sue,</hi> French novelist, ranked by some as the chief practitioner of the melodramatic style in fiction, was born at Paris on 10th December 1804. Unlike most voluminous writers of light literature, Sue was a man of fortune. He was the son of a surgeon in Napoleon’s army, and is said to have had the empress Josephine for godmother. But in later life he became something very different from a Bonapartist, and his residence in Savoy for the last years of his life was due to his having been banished from France after the <hi rend="italic">coup d’état.</hi> Until his father’s death in 1828 Sue pursued the same profession and was present as a surgeon both in the campaign undertaken by France in 1823 for the re-establishment of royal power in Spain and at the battle of Navarino (1828). His naval experiences supplied much of the materials of his first novels, <hi rend="italic">Kemock le Pirate, Attar-Gull, La Salamandre, La Coucaratcha,</hi> and others, which were composed at the height of the romantic movement of 1830, and displayed its Byronic enthusiasm, its fancy for outlandish subjects and names, and (in a very full measure) its extravagance. Then he took to more serious work, writing a naval history of France of no merit. His next venture was the historical or quasi- historical novel, in which style he composed <hi rend="italic">Jean Cavalier</hi> (1840), besides other stories of adventure. About this time he was strongly affected by the socialist ideas of the day, and his attempt to display these in fiction produced (with others) his most famous and perhaps best works,— <hi rend="italic">Les Mystères de Paris</hi> (1842) and <hi rend="italic">Le Juif Errant</hi> (1844-45). These were among the most popular specimens of the <hi rend="italic">roman-feuilleton,</hi> then at the height of its popularity. The political and philosophical or pseudo-philosophical “purpose” continuing to gain more and more ground on the novelist’s art, he followed these up with divers singular and not very edifying books, such as <hi rend="italic">Les Sept Peches Capitaux, Les Mystères du Peuple,</hi> and several others, all on a very large scale, though the number of volumes— ten, twelve, and sometimes even sixteen—gives rather an exaggerated idea of their length. Some of his books, especially the <hi rend="italic">Wandering Jew</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Mysteries of Pams,</hi> were dramatized by himself, usually in collaboration with others. His popularity was immense, and, despite gross faults both of art and of morality (the latter somewhat exaggerated in general estimation, at least when the work of his successors is compared), he deserved that popularity in part. By an accident, which is noteworthy in the case of other pairs of novelists (notably in those of Thackeray and Dickens, and earlier of Fielding and Richardson), his period of greatest success and popularity coincided with that of another writer, and he has been even recently, and by not despicable authorities, compared with and exalted above Alexandre Dumas. This is entirely unjust, for Sue has neither Dumas’s wide range of subject, nor his genial humanity of tone, nor his interest of character, nor, above all, his faculty of conducting the story by means of lively dialogue ; he has, however, a command of terror which Dumas seldom or never attained, and which, melodramatic as he is, sometimes comes within measurable distance of the sublime, while his “ purpose ” gives him a certain energy not easily to be found elsewhere in novel-writing. From the purely literary point of view his style is undistinguished, not to say bad, and his construction loose and prolix. After the revolution of 1848 he sat for Paris (the Seine) in the assembly from April 1850 until his exile as above- mentioned. This exile rather stimulated than checked his literary production. The works of his last days, however (the chief of which is perhaps <hi rend="italic">Le Diable Médecin),</hi> are on the whole much inferior to those of his middle period. Sue died at Annecy (Savoy) on 3d August 1859.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
