<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">his revulsion from the sceptical conclusions of Hume. In several passages of his writings he expressly dates his&nbsp;philosophical awakening from the appearance of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Treatise of Human Nature.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> “I acknowledge,” he says&nbsp;in the dedication of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Enquiry,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> “ that I never thought&nbsp;of calling in question the principles commonly received&nbsp;with regard to the human understanding until the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Treatise of Human Nature</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> was published in the year&nbsp;1739. The ingenious author of that treatise upon the&nbsp;principles of Locke—who was no sceptic—hath built a&nbsp;system of scepticism which leaves no ground to believe&nbsp;any one thing rather than its contrary. His reasoning&nbsp;appeared to me to be just; there was, therefore, a necessity&nbsp;to call in question the principles upon which it was&nbsp;founded, or to admit the conclusion.” Reid thus takes&nbsp;Hume’s scepticism as, on its own showing, a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">reductio&nbsp;ad impossibile</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> of accepted philosophical principles, and&nbsp;refuses, accordingly, to separate Hume from his intellectual progenitors. From its origin in Descartes and&nbsp;onwards through Locke and Berkeley, modern philosophy&nbsp;carried with it, Reid contends, the germ of scepticism.&nbsp;That scepticism, “ inlaid in it and reared along with it,”&nbsp;Hume did but bring to light. Embracing the whole&nbsp;philosophic movement under the name of “ the Cartesian&nbsp;system,” Reid detects its </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">-n-pwrov</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> i/reDSos in the unproved&nbsp;assumption shared by these thinkers “that all the objects&nbsp;of my knowledge are ideas in my own mind.” This doctrine&nbsp;or hypothesis he usually speaks of as “ the ideal system ”&nbsp;or “the theory of ideas”; and to it he opposes his own&nbsp;analysis of the act of perception. In view of the results of&nbsp;this analysis, Reid’s theory (and the theory of Scottish&nbsp;philosophy generally) has been dubbed natural realism or&nbsp;natural dualism in contrast to theories like subjective&nbsp;idealism and materialism or to the cosmothetic idealism or&nbsp;hypothetical dualism of the majority of philosophers. But&nbsp;this is unduly to narrow the scope of Scottish philosophy,&nbsp;which does not exhaust itself, as it is sometimes supposed&nbsp;to do, in uncritically reasserting the independent existence&nbsp;of matter and its immediate presence to mind. The real&nbsp;significance of Reid’s doctrine lies in its attack upon the&nbsp;principles which Hume explicitly lays down as the alpha&nbsp;and the omega of his system, viz., the principles that all&nbsp;our perceptions are distinct existences, and that the mind&nbsp;never perceives any real connexion among distinct existences </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(cf.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Appendix to the third volume of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Treatise,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">1740). It is here that the danger of “ the ideal system ”&nbsp;really lies — in its reduction of reality to “ particular&nbsp;perceptions,” momentary or “perishing” existences essentially unconnected with each other. If the ultimate&nbsp;elements of experience are unrelated units or sense-atoms, called impressions, then it only remains to be&nbsp;shown, as Hume attempts to show, how the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">illusion</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> of&nbsp;supposed necessary connexion arises. But Reid meets&nbsp;this scepticism by combating the principle on which it is&nbsp;based. In logical language, he denies the actuality of the&nbsp;abstract particular: unrelated impressions and ideas nowhere&nbsp;exist. The unit of knowledge is not an isolated impression&nbsp;but a judgment; and in such a judgment is contained,&nbsp;even initially, the reference both to a permanent subject&nbsp;and to a permanent world of thought, and, implied in&nbsp;these, such judgments, for example, as those of existence,&nbsp;substance, cause and effect. Such principles are not&nbsp;derived from sensation, bujb are “ suggested ” on occasion&nbsp;of sensation, in such a way as to constitute the necessary&nbsp;conditions of our having perceptive experience at all.&nbsp;Thus we do not start with “ ideas, ” and afterwards refer&nbsp;them to objects; we are never restricted to our own&nbsp;minds, but are from the first immediately related to a&nbsp;permanent world. Reid has a variety of names for the&nbsp;principles which, by their presence, lift us out of subjec</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">tivity into perception. He calls them “ natural judgments,” “natural suggestions,” “judgments of nature,” “judgments immediately inspired by our constitution,” “principles of our nature,” “first principles,” “principles of&nbsp;common sense.” The last designation, which became the&nbsp;current one, was undoubtedly unfortunate, and has conveyed&nbsp;to many a false impression of Scottish philosophy. It has&nbsp;been understood as if Reid had merely appealed from the&nbsp;reasoned conclusions of philosophers to the unreasoned&nbsp;beliefs of common life. The tirades of men like Beattie&nbsp;and Oswald, and many unguarded utterances of Reid&nbsp;himself, lent countenance to this notion. But Reid’s&nbsp;actions are better than his words; his real mode of&nbsp;procedure is to redargue Hume’s conclusions by a&nbsp;refutation of the premises inherited by him from his&nbsp;predecessors. For the rest, as regards the question of&nbsp;nomenclature, Reid everywhere unites common sense&nbsp;and reason, making the former “only another name for&nbsp;one branch or degree of reason.” Reason, as judging of&nbsp;things self-evident, is called common-sense to distinguish it&nbsp;from ratiocination or reasoning. And in regard to Reid’s&nbsp;favourite proof of the principles in question by reference&nbsp;to “ the consent of ages and nations, of the learned and&nbsp;unlearned,” it is only fair to observe that this argument&nbsp;assumes a much more scientific form in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Essays,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> where&nbsp;it is almost identified with an appeal to “the structure&nbsp;and grammar of all languages.” “The structure of all&nbsp;languages,” he says, “is grounded upon common sense.”&nbsp;To take but one example, “ the distinction between sensible qualities and the substance to which they belong,&nbsp;and between thought and the mind that thinks, is not the&nbsp;invention of philosophers; it is found in the structure of&nbsp;all languages, and therefore must be common to all men who&nbsp;speak with understanding” (Hamilton’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Reid,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> pp. 229 and&nbsp;454).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The principles which Reid insists upon as everywhere present in experience evidently correspond pretty closely&nbsp;to the Kantian categories and the unity of apperception.&nbsp;Similarly, Reid’s assertion of the essential distinction&nbsp;between space or extension and feeling or any succession&nbsp;of feelings may be compared with Kant’s doctrine in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">¿Esthetic.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> “Space,” he says, “whether tangible or visible,&nbsp;is not so properly an object [Kant’s “matter”] as a necessary concomitant of the objects both of sight and touch.”&nbsp;Like Kant, too, Reid finds in space the source of a&nbsp;necessity which sense, as sense, cannot give (Hamilton’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Reid,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> 323). In the substance of their answer to Hume,&nbsp;the two philosophers have therefore much in common.&nbsp;But Reid lacked the art to give due impressiveness to the&nbsp;important advance which his positions really contain.&nbsp;Although at times he states his principles with a wonderful degree of breadth and insight, he mars the total effect&nbsp;by frequent looseness of statement, and by the amount of&nbsp;irrelevant psychological matter with which they are&nbsp;overlaid. And, if Kant was overridden by - a love of&nbsp;formal completeness and symmetry, Reid’s extreme&nbsp;indifference to form and system is an even more dangerous defect in a philosopher. It has also to be admitted&nbsp;that the principles frequently appear in Reid more as&nbsp;matter of assertion than as demonstrated necessities for&nbsp;the constitution of experience. The transcendental deduction, or proof from the possibility of experience in general,&nbsp;which forms the vital centre of the Kantian scheme, is&nbsp;wanting in Reid; or, at all events, if the spirit of the&nbsp;proof is occasionally present, it is nowhere adequately stated&nbsp;and emphasized. But, when these defects are acknowledged,&nbsp;Reid’s insistence on judgment as the unit of knowledge and&nbsp;his sharp distinction between sensation and perception must&nbsp;still be recognized as philosophical results of the highest&nbsp;importance. They embody the only possible answer to</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
