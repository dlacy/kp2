<p><span class="font0">Cornell, Columbia and Pennsylvania to organise contests at Poughkeepsie open to all colleges. In 1899 and 1900 Pennsylvania won, in 1902, 1904 and 1908 Syracuse, and in most other&nbsp;years Cornell. The two annual inter-collegiate regattas are the&nbsp;Harvard-Yale at New London, and that at Poughkeepsie, open&nbsp;to all but not participated in by Harvard and Yale. By way&nbsp;of exception, Harvard rowed at Poughkeepsie in 1896, and in&nbsp;1897 and 1898 Cornell rowed in two regattas. In 1901 Pennsylvania was just beaten by Leander Club in the race for the&nbsp;Grand Challenge Cup at Henley.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The history of amateur rowing in the United States, other than that of the colleges and universities, is a narrative of&nbsp;continual struggles on the part of the authorities to distinguish&nbsp;between the amateur and the non-amateur. The National&nbsp;Association of Amateur Oarsmen was established in 1872.&nbsp;Many regattas have been held since that date under their&nbsp;rules, but the standard of amateurism which satisfied the |&nbsp;N.A.A.O. has never been strict enough to comply with the&nbsp;requirements of the English A.R.A. or the Henley Stewards.&nbsp;In 1883 a Hillsdale four from U.S.A. tendered an entry at&nbsp;Henley, but it was refused by the Stewards, on the ground&nbsp;that the men were not amateurs according to the English&nbsp;definition. In subsequent years several American scullers&nbsp;entered for the Diamond Sculls, and in 1897 they were won by&nbsp;E. H. Ten-Eyck of Wachusett Boat Club, Worcester, U.S.A.&nbsp;In 1898 Ten-Eyck’s entry was refused by the Henley Stewards.&nbsp;No little resentment has been caused in America by the reluctance of the English authorities to accept American entries,&nbsp;but their justification lies in the essential difference, not only&nbsp;in letter but in spirit, between the laws and customs of the&nbsp;two countries with regard to the amateur status and amateur&nbsp;sport. In 1904 a crew of the Vesper B.C. of Philadelphia were&nbsp;duly vouched by the N.A.A.O. and their entry accepted by&nbsp;the Henley Stewards. They competed and were beaten, and&nbsp;it afterwards became known that not only had several of the&nbsp;men made money out of the trip, but that two or three of the&nbsp;oarsmen were not qualified to row at Henley. It also appeared&nbsp;that certain members of the N.A.A.O. had, to say the least&nbsp;of it, been extremely careless in giving assurances as to the&nbsp;status of the Vesper crew, and all relations between the N.A.A.O.&nbsp;and the Henley Stewards were abruptly terminated, the Stewards&nbsp;determining that they would not accept foreign entries except&nbsp;from a country where there was a governing body which had&nbsp;control of amateur rowing and which had an agreement with&nbsp;the Stewards by which they definitely pledged themselves not&nbsp;to send competitors to Henley unless they came within the&nbsp;English definition. In 1906 Harvard challenged Cambridge.&nbsp;The race, which attracted an immense concourse of spectators,&nbsp;was rowed from Putney to Mortlake in September. Cambridge&nbsp;led from the start and won by three lengths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rowing in other Countries.—</span><span class="font0">During the latter years of the 19th century and during the early years of the present century,&nbsp;rowing increased very greatly in popularity as a branch of&nbsp;athletic sport in every quarter of the globe. It would be&nbsp;impossible here to describe the history or organization of boat&nbsp;clubs and regattas in Australia, in Canada, and in the various&nbsp;countries of Europe. Canadian rowing has always been of a&nbsp;high class. In 1904 L. Scholes, a Canadian sculler, won the&nbsp;Diamond Sculls at Henley, and on several occasions Canadian&nbsp;eights and fours have competed for the Grand Challenge and&nbsp;Stewards Challenge Cups at Henley. In Australia they have&nbsp;a regatta which is called the “ Australian Henley,” and an&nbsp;inter-university contest for a cup presented by Oxford and&nbsp;Cambridge oarsmen. In Europe international championships&nbsp;have been instituted in the hope of bringing together oarsmen&nbsp;and scullers from all countries. The Belgian oarsmen have by&nbsp;their Henley successes achieved the greatest distinction among&nbsp;continental oarsmen. In Holland the principal rowing clubs&nbsp;have their headquarters at Amsterdam, and several Dutch&nbsp;crews have been seen at Henley. In France there are innumerable rowing clubs which are now governed by the Fédération française, a body which has a strict code of rules, but&nbsp;which has not adopted quite so strict an amateur definition&nbsp;as that of the English A.R.A. In Germany, also, rowing is&nbsp;very extensively practised under the auspices of the Deutsche&nbsp;Ruderverband; the chief contests between English and German&nbsp;crews of recent years were at the Cork Regatta of 1902 when&nbsp;Leander Club defeated the Berlin Club in the eight-oared race,&nbsp;and at the Henley Regatta of 1907, when a four of the Lud-wigshafener Club were defeated in a heat of the Stewards Cup&nbsp;by a Leander crew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Methods and Style.</span><span class="font0">—The English style is the only one in which the oarsman swings his body to the full extent fore and aft, at the&nbsp;same time making use of his sliding seat. Most of the foreign&nbsp;crews who have competed in England have sacrificed a portion&nbsp;of their swing in order to enable them, as they believe, to&nbsp;make better use of their leg work. There can be no doubt&nbsp;that the English style is in a sense more exhausting to the&nbsp;oarsman, that is to say it enables him to bring more muscle&nbsp;into play and to make full use of his weight and strength,&nbsp;but in spite of recent defeats it is still believed by English&nbsp;oarsmen to be the most effective. The crews of 1906 and 1907&nbsp;which were defeated by the Belgians were the best that England&nbsp;could at the time produce, but they undoubtedly rowed in a&nbsp;style 'which fell a long way short ot ideal English rowing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The secret of good rowing is the simultaneous application of leg and body work from end to end of the stroke. The instant&nbsp;the blades are covered the whole weight must be lifted from&nbsp;the stretcher and applied to the oar-handle, and must remain&nbsp;so applied until the hands come in to the chest. In order to&nbsp;ensure that the pressure so applied to the blade shall be as&nbsp;long and as -hard as possible, the body must be swung forward to its full extent, and during the stroke the shoulders&nbsp;must always be swinging back faster than the seat, while at&nbsp;the same time the legs are driving hard at the stretcher. The&nbsp;slide and swing should be finished simultaneously. There&nbsp;are many subsidiary rules of style as to the movements of the&nbsp;hands and arms, but they are all of secondary importance and&nbsp;are devised so as to enable the average man to execute the&nbsp;working portion of the stroke effectively and often, without&nbsp;undue exertion to himself. The movements of a crew must&nbsp;be as nearly as possible simultaneous in every particular. There&nbsp;have been many instances of crews which although inferior in&nbsp;style and strength to their opponents have been victorious&nbsp;owing to being “ better together.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROWLAND, HENRY AUGUSTUS (1848-1901), American physicist, was born at Honesdale, Pennsylvania, on the 27th&nbsp;of November 1848. From an early age he exhibited marked&nbsp;scientific tastes and spent all his spare time in electrical and&nbsp;chemical experiments. At the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at&nbsp;Troy, N.Y. he graduated in 1870, and he then obtained an engagement on the Western New York railway. But the work there&nbsp;was not to his liking, and after a short time he gave it up for an&nbsp;instructorship in natural science at the university of Wooster,&nbsp;Ohio, which in turn he resigned in order to return to Troy as&nbsp;assistant professor of physics. Finally, in 1876. he became&nbsp;the first occupant of the chair of physics at the Johns Hopkins&nbsp;University, Baltimore, a position which he retained until his&nbsp;premature death on the 16th of April 1901. Rowland was&nbsp;one of the most brilliant men of science that America has produced, and it is curious that at first his merits were not&nbsp;perceived in his own country, In America he was unable even&nbsp;to secure the publication of certain of his scientific papers; but&nbsp;Clerk Maxwell at once saw their excellence, and had them&nbsp;printed in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Philosophical Magazine.</span><span class="font0"> When the managers&nbsp;of the Johns Hopkins University asked advice in Europe as to&nbsp;whom they should make their professor of physics, he was&nbsp;pointed out in all quarters as the best man for the post. In&nbsp;the interval between his election and the assumption of his&nbsp;duties at Baltimore, he studied physics under Helmholtz at</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
