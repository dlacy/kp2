<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font1">uΓe. So imperfect is our mathematical knowledge, that even Mr d’Alembert has not been able to exem-plify the application of the equation to the ſimpleſt caſe&nbsp;which can be propoſed, ſuch as the direct impulſe on&nbsp;a plane ſurface wholly immerſed in the ſtuid. All that&nbsp;he is enabled to do, is to apply it (by ſome modifications and ſubſtitutions which take it out of its ſtate of&nbsp;extreme generality) to the direct impulſe of a vein of&nbsp;ſiuid on a plane which deflects it wholly, and thus to&nbsp;ſhow its conformity to the ſolutioh given by Daniel&nbsp;Bernoulli, and to obſervation and experience. He&nbsp;ſhows, that this impulſe (independent of the deficiency&nbsp;arifing from the plane’s not being of infinite extent) is&nbsp;ſomewhat lefs than the weight of a column whoſe baſe&nbsp;is the ſection of the vein, and whoſe height is twice the&nbsp;fall neceffary for communicating the velocity. This&nbsp;great philoſopher and geometer concludes by faying,&nbsp;that he does not believe that any method can be found&nbsp;for ſolving this problem that is more direct and ſimple ;&nbsp;and imagines, that if the deductions from it ſhall be&nbsp;found not to agree with experiment, we muſt give up all&nbsp;hopes of determining the reſiſtance of fluids by theory&nbsp;and analytical calculus. He ſays </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">analytical calculus ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">for all the phyfical principles on which the calculus pro-ceeds are rigorouſly demonſtrated, and will not admit&nbsp;of a doubt. There is only one hypotheſis introduced&nbsp;in his inveſtigation, and this is not a phyſtcal hypothe-ſis, but a hypotheſis of calculation. It is, that the&nbsp;quantities which determine the ratios of the fecond ſiu-xions of the velocities, eſtimated in the directions pa-railel and perpendicular to the axis AC (fig. 16.) are&nbsp;functions of the abſciffa AP, and ordinate PM of the&nbsp;curve. Any perſon, in the leaſt acquainted with mathematical analyſis, will ſee, that without this ſuppoſi-tion no analyſis or calculus whatever can be inſtituted.&nbsp;But let üs ſee what is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">phyβcal</span><span class="font1"> meaning of this hypothecs. It is ſimply this, that the motion of the par-ticle M depends on its ſituation only. It appears im-poſſible to form any other opinion ; and if we could&nbsp;form Juch an opinion, it is as clear as day-light that&nbsp;the caſe is deſperate, and that we muſt renounce all&nbsp;hopes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">W¢ are forry to bring our labours to this concluſion; but we are of opinion, that the only thing that remains&nbsp;is, for mathematicians to attach themſelves with ſirm-neſs and vigour to fome ſimple cafes ; and, without&nbsp;aiming at generality, to apply Mr d’Alembert’s or Bernoulli’s mode of procedure to the particular circum-ſtances of the cafe. It is not improbable but that, in&nbsp;the ſolutions which may be obtained of theſc particular&nbsp;cafes, circumftances may occur which are of a more ge-neral nature. Theſe will be ſo many laws of hydraulics to be added to our preſent very ſcanty ſtock ; and&nbsp;thele may have points of reſemblance, which will give&nbsp;birth to laws of ſtill greater generality. And we repeat our expreſſion of hopes of ſome ſucceſs, by endea-vouring to determine, in ſome ſimple caſes, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">minimum&nbsp;poflibile</span><span class="font1"> of motion. The attempts of the Jeſuit commentators on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prindpia</span><span class="font1"> to aſcertain this on the New-tonian hypotheſis do them honour, anil have really given us great aſſiſtance in thc particular caſe which came&nbsp;through their hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And we ſhould multiply experiments on the reſiſtance of bodies. Thoſe of the French academy are undoubtedly of ineſtimable value, and will always be </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ap-</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">peaied to. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">But </span><span class="font1">there are circumſtaiices in thofe experiments which render them more complicated than is proper tor a general theory, and which therefore limit&nbsp;the concluſions which we wiſh to draw from them. The&nbsp;bodies Were floating on the ſurface. This greatly modifies the deflections of the filaments of water, cauſing&nbsp;ſome to deflect laterally, which would otherwiſe have&nbsp;remained in one vertical plane ; and this circumſtance&nbsp;alſo neceffarily produced what the academicians callcd&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">remou,</span><span class="font1"> or accumulation on the anterior part of the&nbsp;body, and depreſſion behind it. This produced an ad-ditional reſiſtance, which was meaſured with great diffi-culty and uncertainty. The effect of adheſion mull&nbsp;alſo havc been very conſiderable, and very different ill&nbsp;the different caſes ; and it is of difficult calculation. It&nbsp;cannot perhaps be totally removed in any experiment,&nbsp;and it is neceffary to conſider it as making part of the&nbsp;reſiſtance in the moil important practical caſes, viz. the&nbsp;motion of ſhips. Here we ſee that its effect is very&nbsp;great. Every ſeaman knows that the ſpeed, even of </span><span class="font2">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">copper-ſheathed ſhip, is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">greatly</span><span class="font1"> increaſed bygrealing her&nbsp;bottom. The difference is too remarkable to admit&nbsp;of a doubt : nor ſhould we be ſurpriſed at this, when we&nbsp;attend to the diminution of the motion of water in long&nbsp;pipes. A fmooth pipe four and an half inches diameter, and 500 yards long, yields but one-fifth of the&nbsp;quantity which it ought to do independent of friction.&nbsp;But adheſion does a great deal which cannot be corn-pared with friction, we ſee that water flowing thro’&nbsp;a hole in a thin plate will be increaſed in quantity&nbsp;fully one-third, by adding a little tube wlioſe length is&nbsp;about twice the diameter of the hole. The adheſion&nbsp;therefore will greatly modify the action of the fila-ments both on the ſolid body and on each other, and&nbsp;will change both the forms of the curves and the velo-cities in different points ; and this is a fort of objec-tion to the only hypotheſis introduced by d'Alembert&gt;,&nbsp;Yet it is only a fort oſ objection ; for the effect of this&nbsp;adheſion, too, mull undoubtedly depend on the fituation&nbsp;of the particle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The form of thefe experiments of the academy is ilI-fuited to the examination of the reſiſtance of bodies wholly immerſed in the fluid. The form of experiment adopted by Robins for the reſiſtance of air,&nbsp;and afterwards by the Chevalier Borda for water, is&nbsp;tree from theſe inconveniences, and is ſuſceptible of&nbsp;equal accuracy. The great advantage of both is the&nbsp;exact knowledge which they give us of the velocity of&nbsp;the motion ; a circumſtance effentially ncceffary, and but&nbsp;imperfectly known in the experiments of Mariotte and&nbsp;others, who examined quieſcent bodies expofed to the&nbsp;action oſ a- ſtream. It is extremely difficult to meaſure&nbsp;the velocity of a ſtream. It is very different in its different parts. It is ſwifteft of all in the middle ſuperſi-cial filament, and diminiſhes as we recede from this towards the ſides or bottom, and the rate of diminution&nbsp;is not preciſely known. Could this be afcertained with&nbsp;the neceffary preciſion, we ſhould recommend the fol-lowing form of experiment as the moſt ſtmple, eaſy, eco-Homical, and accurate.</span></p>
