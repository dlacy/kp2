<p><span class="font1">plebeian organization was materially advanced by the Publilian law of 471 b.c.,</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>@@1</sup> which appears to have formally recognized as lawful the plebeian </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concilia,</span><span class="font1"> and established&nbsp;also the tribune’s right </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cum plebe agere, i.e.</span><span class="font1"> to propose and carry&nbsp;resolutions in them. These assemblies were </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tributa,</span><span class="font1"> or, in other&nbsp;words, the voting in them took place not by curies or centuries&nbsp;but by tribes. In them, lastly, after the Publilian law, if not&nbsp;before, the tribunes were annually elected.<sup>@@2</sup> By this law the&nbsp;foundations were laid both of the powerful </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concilia plebis</span><span class="font1"> of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">/ater days and also of the legislative and judicial prerogatives of the tribunes. The patricians maintained indeed that resolutions&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(plébiscita)</span><span class="font1"> carried by tribunes in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concilia plebis</span><span class="font1"> were not&nbsp;binding on their order, but the moral weight of such resolutions,&nbsp;whether they affirmed a general principle or pronounced sentence&nbsp;of condemnation on some single patrician, was no doubt considerable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The next stage in the struggle is marked by the attempt to substitute a public written law for unwritten usage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The proposal of C. Terentilius Arsa (462 b.c.) to appoint a plebeian commission to draw up laws restricting the powers of the consuls<sup>@@3</sup> was resolutely opposed by the patricians»&nbsp;but after ten years of bitter party strife a compromise was&nbsp;effected. A commission of ten patricians was appointed, who&nbsp;should frame and publish a code of law binding equally&nbsp;on both the orders. These decemviri were to be the&nbsp;sole and supreme magistrates for the year, and the law&nbsp;of appeal w<sup>T</sup>as suspended in their favour.<sup>@@4</sup> The code which they&nbsp;promulgated, the famous XII. Tables, owed little of its importance&nbsp;to any novelties or improvements contained in its provisions.&nbsp;For the most part it seems merely to have reaffirmed existing&nbsp;usages andlaws (see Roman Law). But it imposed, as it was intended to do, a check on the arbitrary administration of justice by&nbsp;the magistrates. With the publication of the code the proper&nbsp;work of the decemvirs was finished; nevertheless, for the next&nbsp;year a fresh decemvirate was elected, and it is conceivable that&nbsp;the intention was permanently to substitute government by&nbsp;an irresponsible patrician “ council of ten ” for the old constitution.<sup>@@5</sup> However this may have been, the tyranny of the&nbsp;decemvirs themselves was fatal to the continuance of their&nbsp;power. We are told of a second secession of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plebs,</span><span class="font1"> this time&nbsp;to the Janiculum, and of negotiations with the senate, the&nbsp;result ofr which was the enforced abdication of the decemvirs.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plebs</span><span class="font1"> joyfully chose for themselves tribunes, and in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">camitia centuriata</span><span class="font1"> two consuls were created. But this restoration of the old regime was accompanied by legislation which&nbsp;made it an important crisis in the history of the&nbsp;struggle between the orders. With the fall of the&nbsp;decemvirate this struggle enters upon a new phase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The tribunes appear as at once more powerful and more strictly constitutional magistrates; the plebeian </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concilia</span><span class="font1"> take their&nbsp;place by the side of the older assemblies; and finally this improved machinery is used not simply in self-defence against&nbsp;patrician oppression but to obtain complete political equality.&nbsp;This change was no doubt due in part to circumstances outside&nbsp;legislation, above all to the expansion of the Roman state,&nbsp;which swelled the numbers and added to the social importance&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plebs</span><span class="font1"> as compared with the dwindling forces of the close&nbsp;corporation of patrician </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gentes.</span><span class="font1"> Still the legislation of 449&nbsp;clearly involved more than a restoration of the old form of&nbsp;government. The Valerio-Horatian laws, besides reaffirming&nbsp;the right of appeal and the inviolability of the tribunes, improved the position of the plebeian assemblies by enacting&nbsp;that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plébiscita</span><span class="font1"> passed in them, and, as seems probable, approved&nbsp;by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patres,</span><span class="font1"> should be binding on patricians as well as plebeians.<sup>@@6</sup></span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">By this law the tribunes obtained a recognized initiative in legislation. Henceforth the desired reforms were introduced&nbsp;and carried by tribunes in what were now styled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia&nbsp;tributa,</span><span class="font1"> and, if sanctioned by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patres,</span><span class="font1"> became laws of the&nbsp;state. From this period, too, must be dated the legalization&nbsp;at any rate of the tribune’s right to impeach any citizen before&nbsp;the assembly of the tribes.<sup>@@7</sup> Henceforward there is no question&nbsp;of the tribune’s right to propose to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plebs</span><span class="font1"> to impose a fine,&nbsp;or of the validity of the sentence when passed. The efficiency&nbsp;of these new weapons of attack was amply proved by the subsequent course of the struggle. Only a few years after the Valerio-Horatian legislation came the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lex Camdeia,</span><span class="font1"> itself </span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plebiscitum&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(445 B.c.), by which mixed marriages between patricians&nbsp;and plebeians were declared lawful, and the social&nbsp;exclusiveness of the patriciate broken down. In the&nbsp;same year with this measure, and like it in the interests primarily&nbsp;of the wealthier plebeians, a vigorous attack commenced on the&nbsp;patrician monopoly of the consulate, and round this&nbsp;stronghold of patrician ascendancy the conflict raged&nbsp;until the passing of the Licinian laws in 367. The&nbsp;original proposal of the tribune Gaius Canulcius, in&nbsp;445, that the people should be allowed to elect a plebeian consul&nbsp;was evaded by a compromise. The senate resolved that for&nbsp;the next year, in the stead of consuls, six military tribunes&nbsp;with consular powers should be elected,<sup>@@8</sup> and that the new&nbsp;office should be open to patricians and plebeians alike. The&nbsp;consulship was thus for the time saved from pollution, as the&nbsp;patricians phrased it, but the growing strength of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plebs</span><span class="font1"> is&nbsp;shown by the fact that in fifty years out of the seventy-eight&nbsp;between 444 and 366 they succeeded in obtaining the&nbsp;election of consular tribunes rather than of consuls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Despite, however, these discouragements, the patricians fought on. Each year they strove to secure the creation of consuls rather&nbsp;than consular tribunes, and failing this strained every nerve to&nbsp;secure for their own order at least a majority among the latter.&nbsp;Even the institution of the censorship (435)? though&nbsp;rendered desirable by the increasing importance and&nbsp;complexity of the census, was, it is probable, due in part to their&nbsp;desire to discount beforehand the threatened loss of the consulship hy diminishing its powers.<sup>@@9</sup> Other causes, too, helped to&nbsp;protract the struggle. Between the wealthier plebeians, who&nbsp;were ambitious of high office, and the poorer, whose minds were&nbsp;set rather on allotments of land, there was a division of interest&nbsp;of which the patricians were not slow to take advantage, and&nbsp;to this must be added the pressure of war. The death struggle&nbsp;with Veii and the sack of Rome by the Gauls absorbed for the&nbsp;time all the energies of the community. In 377, however, two of the tribunes, C. Licinius Stolo (see Licinius&nbsp;Stolo, Gaius) and L. Sextius,came forward with proposals which&nbsp;united all sections of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plebs</span><span class="font1"> in their support. Their proposals&nbsp;were as follows:<sup>@@10</sup> (1) that consuls and not consular tribunes&nbsp;be elected; (2) that one consul at least should be a plebeian;&nbsp;(3) that the priestly college, which had the charge of the&nbsp;Sibylline books, should consist of ten members instead of&nbsp;two, and that of these half should be plebeians; (4) that no&nbsp;single citizen should hold in occupation more than 500 acres&nbsp;of the common lands, or pasture upon them more than 100 head&nbsp;of cattle and 500 sheep; (5) that all landowners should employ&nbsp;a certain amount of free as well as slave labour on their estates;&nbsp;(6) that interest already paid on debts should be deducted&nbsp;from the principal, and the remainder paid off in three years.&nbsp;The three last proposals were obviously intended to meet the&nbsp;patres plebiscitis legem comitiis centuriatis tulere, ut quod tributim&nbsp;plebs jussisset populum tencret, qua lege tribuniciis rogationibus&nbsp;telum acerrimum datum est.” What were the precise conditions&nbsp;under which a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plebiscitum</span><span class="font1"> became law can, only be, conjectured.&nbsp;The control of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patres</span><span class="font1"> over legislation certainly remained effective&nbsp;until 287 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font1"> (See below.)</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
