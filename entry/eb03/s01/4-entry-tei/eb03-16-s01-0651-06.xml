(James), in Latin <hi rend="italic">Actius Cincenis Sannazarius,</hi> a celebrated Latin and Italian poet, born at Naples in 1458. He by his wit ingratiated himſelf into the favour of king Frederic; and, when that prince was dethroned, attended him into France, where he ſtaid with him till his death, which happened in 154. Sannazarius then returned into Italy, where he applied himſelf to polite literature, and particularly<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0658.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0652"/>
to Latin and Italian poetry. His gay and facetious humour made him ſought for by all companies; but he was ſo afflicted at the news that Phillibert prince of Orange, general of the emperor’s army, had demoliſhed his country-houſe, that it threw him into an illneſs, of which he died in 1530. It is ſaid, that being informed a few days before his death, that the prince of Orange was killed in battle, he called out, “I ſhall die contented, ſince Mars has puniſhed this barbarous enemy of the Muſes.” He wrote a great number of Italian and Latin poems: among thoſe in Latin, his <hi rend="italic">De Partu Virginis</hi> and Eclogues are chiefly eſteemed; and the moſt celebrated of his Italian pieces is his <hi rend="italic">Arcadia.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
