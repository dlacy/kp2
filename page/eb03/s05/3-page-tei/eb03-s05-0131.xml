Born a ſon of a gardener of the duke of Argyle, he arrived at eight years of age before he learnt to read.— By chance a servant having taught young Stone the letters of the alphabet, there needed nothing more to diſcover and expand his genius. He applied himſelf to ſtudy, and he arrived at the knowledge of the moſt sublime geometry and analyſis, without a maſter, without a conductor; without any other guide but pure genius.</p><p>“ At 18 years of age he had made theſe considerable advances without being known, and without knowing himſelf the prodigies of his acquiſitions. The duke of Argyle, who joined to his military talents a general knowledge of every ſcience that adorns the mind of a man of his rank, walking one day in his garden, ſaw lying on the graſs a Latin copy of Sir Iſaac Newton’s celebrated <hi rend="italic">Pricipia.</hi> He called ſome one to him to take and carry it back to his library. Our young gardener told him that the book belonged to him. ‘ To you ?’ replied the Duke. ‘ Do you underſtand geometry, Latin, Newton ?’ I know a little of them, replied the young man with an air of ſimplicity ariſing from a profound ignorance of his own knowledge and talents. The Duke was ſurpriſed ; and having a taste for the ſciences, he entered into converſation with the young mathematician : he aſked him ſeveral queſtions, and was aſtoniſhed at the force, the accuracy, and the candour of his anſwers. ‘ But how, ſaid the Duke, came you by the knowledge of all theſe things ?’ Stone replied, ‘A servant taught me, ten years ſince, to read: does one need to know any thing more than the 24 letters in order to learn every thing elle that one wishes?’ The Duke’s curioſity redoubled—he ſat down upon a bank, and requeſted a detail of all his proceedings in becoming ſo learned.</p><p>“ I firſt learned to read, ſaid Stone : the masons were then at work upon your houſe : I went near them one day, and I ſaw that the architect uſed a rule, compasses, and that he made calculations. I inquired what might be the meaning and uſe of theſe things ; and I was informed that there was a ſcience called Arithmetic : I purchaſed a book of arithmetic, and I learned it. — I was told there was another ſcience called Geometry : I bought the books, and I learnt geometry. By reading I found that there were good books in theſe two ſciences in Latin : I bought a dictionary, and I learned Latin. I understood alſo that there were good books of the ſame kind in French : I bought a dictionary, and I learned French. And this, my lord, is what I have done : it ſeems to me that we may learn every thing when we know the 24 letters of the alphabet.”</p><p>This account charmed the Duke. He drew this wonderful genius out of his obſcurity ; and he provided him with an employment which left him plenty of time to apply himſelf to the ſciences. He diſeovered in him alſo the ſame genius for muſic, for painting, for architecture, for all the ſciences which depend on calculations and proportions.”</p><p>“ I have ſeen Mr Stone. He is a man of great simplicity. He is at preſent ſenſible of his own knowledge ; but he is not puffed up with it. He is poſſeſſed with a pure and diſtinterested love for the mathematics, though he is not ſolicitous to pats for a mathematician ; vanity having no part in the great labour he ſuſtains to excel in that ſcience. He deſpiſes fortune alſo ; and he has ſolicited me twenty times to requeſt the duke to give him leſs employment, which may not be worth the half of that he now has, in order to be more retired, and leſs taken off from his favourite studies. He diſcovers ſometimes, by methods of his</p></body></text></TEI>
