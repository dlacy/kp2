<p><span class="font0">the focal plane of the objective O there is a scale </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sc,</span><span class="font0"> exact reading being made by a micrometer Z. If a large quantity of liquid be available it is sufficient to dip the refractometer perpendicularly&nbsp;into a beaker containing the liquid and to transmit light into the&nbsp;instrument by means of a mirror. If only a smaller quantity be&nbsp;available, it is enclosed in a metal beaker M, which forms an extension of the instrument, and the liquid is retained there by a plate D.&nbsp;The instrument is now placed in a trough B, containing water and&nbsp;having one side of ground glass G; light is reflected into the&nbsp;refractometer by means of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">mirror S outside this trough. An&nbsp;accuracy of 3·7 units in the 5th decimal place is obtainable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Pulfrich refractometer is also largely used, especially for liquids. It consists essentially of a right-angled glass prism placed&nbsp;on a metal foundation with the faces at right angles horizontal&nbsp;and vertical, the hypothenuse face being on the support. The&nbsp;horizontal face is fitted with a small cylindrical vessel to hold the&nbsp;liquid. Light is led to the prism at grazing incidence by means&nbsp;of a collimator, and is refracted through the vertical face, the&nbsp;deviation being observed by a telescope rotating about a graduated&nbsp;circle. From this the refractive index is readily calculated if the&nbsp;refractive index of the prism for the light used be known: a fact&nbsp;supplied by the maker. The instrument is also available for&nbsp;determining the refractive index of isotropic solids. A little of&nbsp;the solid is placed in the vessel and a mixture of monobromnaphthalene and acetone (in which the solid must be insoluble) is added,&nbsp;and adjustment made by adding either one or other liquid until&nbsp;the border line appears sharp, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> until the liquid has the same&nbsp;index as the solid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Herbert Smith refractometer (fig. 7) is especially suitable for determining the refractive index of gems, a constant which is most valuable in distinguishing the precious stones. It consists&nbsp;of a hemisphere of very dense glass, having its plane surface fixed&nbsp;at a certain angle to the axis of the instrument. Light is admitted&nbsp;by a window on the under side, which is inclined at the same angle,&nbsp;but in the opposite sense, to the axis. The light on emerging from&nbsp;the hemisphere is received by a convex lens, in the focal plane of&nbsp;which is a scale graduated to read directly in refractive indices.&nbsp;The light then traverses a positive eye-piece. To use the instrument for a gem, a few drops of methylene iodide (the refractive&nbsp;index of which may be raised to 1·800 by dissolving sulphur in.it)&nbsp;are placed on the plane surface of the hemisphere and a facet of&nbsp;the stone then brought into contact with the surface. If mono-chromatic light be used </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.</span><span class="font0"> the D line of the sodium flame) the&nbsp;field is sharply divided into a light and a dark portion, and the position of the line of demarcation on the scale immediately gives the&nbsp;refractive index, It is necessary for the liquid to have a higher&nbsp;refractive index than the crystal, and also that there is close contact&nbsp; between the facet and the lens. The range of the instrument&nbsp;is between 1·400 and 1·760, the results being correct to two units&nbsp;in the third decimal place if sodium light be used. (C. E.*)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">II. Double Refraction</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That a stream of light on entry into certain media can give rise to two refracted pencils was discovered in the case of Iceland&nbsp;spar by Erasmus Bartholinus, who found that one pencil had&nbsp;a direction given by the ordinary law of refraction, but that the&nbsp;other was bent in accordance with a new law that he was&nbsp;unable to determine. This law was discovered about eight&nbsp;years later by Christian Huygens. According to Huygens’&nbsp;fundamental principle, the law of refraction is determined by&nbsp;the form and orientation of the wave-surface in the crystal—&nbsp;the locus of points to which a disturbance emanating from a&nbsp;luminous point travels in unit time. In the case of a doubly&nbsp;refracting medium the wave-surface must have two sheets,&nbsp;one of which is spherical, if one of the pencils obey in all cases&nbsp;the ordinary law of refraction. Now Huygens observed that a&nbsp;natural crystal of spar behaves in precisely the same way whichever pair of faces the light passes through, and inferred from&nbsp;this fact that the second sheet of the wave-surface must be a&nbsp;surface of revolution round a Une equally inclined to the faces&nbsp;of the rhomb, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> round the axis of the crystal. He accordingly&nbsp;assumed it to be a spheroid, and finding that refraction in the&nbsp;direction of the axis was the same for both streams, he concluded&nbsp;that the sphere and the spheroid touched one another in the axis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So far as his experimental means permitted, Huygens verified  the law of refraction deduced from this hypothesis, but its&nbsp;correctness remained unrecognized until the measures of W. H.&nbsp;Wollaston in 1802 and of E. T. Malus in 1810. More recently&nbsp;its truth has been established with far more perfect optical&nbsp;appliances by R. T. Glazebrook, Ch. S. Hastings and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the case of Iceland spar and several other crystals the extraordinarily refracted stream is refracted away from the&nbsp;axis, but Jean Baptiste Biot in 1814 discovered that in many&nbsp;cases the reverse occurs, and attributing the extraordinary&nbsp;refractions to forces that act as if they emanated from the axis,&nbsp;he called crystals of the latter kind “ attractive,’’ those of the&nbsp;former “ repulsive.” They are now termed “ positive ’’ and&nbsp;“ negative ’’ respectively; and Huygens’ law applies to both&nbsp;classes, the spheroid being prolate in the case of positive, and&nbsp;oblate in the case of negative crystals. It was at first supposed&nbsp;that Huygens’ law applied to all doubly refracting media. Sir&nbsp;David Brewster, however, in 1815, while examining the rings&nbsp;that are seen round the optic axis in polarized light, discovered&nbsp;a number of crystals that possess two optic axes. He showed,&nbsp;moreover, that such crystals belong to the rhombic, monoclinic&nbsp;and anorthic (triclinic) systems, those of the tetragonal and&nbsp;hexagonal systems being uniaxal, and those of the cubic system&nbsp;being optically isotropic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Huygens found in the course of his researches that the streams that had traversed a rhomb of Iceland spar had acquired new&nbsp;properties with respect to transmission through a second&nbsp;crystal. This phenomenon is called polarization (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q.v.</span><span class="font1">), and the&nbsp;waves are said to be polarized—the ordinary in its principal&nbsp;plane and the extraordinary in a plane perpendicular to its&nbsp;principal plane, the principal plane of a wave being the plane&nbsp;containing its normal and the axis of the crystal. From the&nbsp;facts of polarization Augustin Jean Fresnel deduced that the</span></p>
