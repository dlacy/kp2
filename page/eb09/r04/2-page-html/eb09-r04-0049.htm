<p><span class="font0">showed the same simplicity of character. As Derzhavin was the poet of the age of Catherine, so Zhukovski (1783-1852) may be said to have been that of the age of&nbsp;Alexander. He is more remarkable, however, as a translator than as an original poet. With him Romanticism&nbsp;began in Russia. The pseudo-classical school, led by the&nbsp;French, was now dead throughout Europe. In 1802 he&nbsp;published his version of Gray’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Elegy,</span><span class="font0"> which at once&nbsp;became a highly popular poem in Russia. Zhukovski&nbsp;translated many pieces from the German (Goethe, Schiller,&nbsp;Uhland) and English (Byron, Moore, Southey). One of&nbsp;his original productions, “ The Poet in the Camp of the&nbsp;Russian Warriors,” was on the lips of every one at the&nbsp;time of the war of the fatherland </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Otechestvennaia Voina)&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">in 1812. He attempted to familiarize the Russians with&nbsp;all the most striking specimens of foreign poetical literature. He produced versions of the episode of Nala and&nbsp;Damayanti from the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mahabharata,</span><span class="font0"> of Rustam and Zohrab&nbsp;from the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Shah-Namah,</span><span class="font0"> and of a part of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Odyssey.</span><span class="font0"> In&nbsp;the case of these three masterpieces, however, he was&nbsp;obliged to work from literal translations (mostly German),&nbsp;as he was unacquainted with the original languages. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Iliad</span><span class="font0"> was translated during this period by Gnedich, who&nbsp;was familiar with Greek. He has produced a faithful and&nbsp;spirited version, and has naturalized the hexameter in the&nbsp;Russian language with much skill. Constantine Batiushkoff&nbsp;(1787-1855) was the author of many elegant poems, and&nbsp;at the outset of his career promised much, but sank into&nbsp;imbecility, and lived in this condition to an advanced age.&nbsp;Merzliakoff and Tziganoff deserve a passing notice as the&nbsp;writers of songs some of which still keep their popularity.&nbsp;As the poet of the age of Catherine was Derzhavin, and&nbsp;of that of Alexander Zhukovski, so the next reign, that&nbsp;of Nicholas, was to have its representative poet, by the&nbsp;common consent of his critics the greatest whom Russia&nbsp;had yet seen. During his short life (1799-1837) Alexander Pushkin produced many celebrated poems, which&nbsp;will be found enumerated in the article devoted to him&nbsp;(see Poushkin). It may suffice to say here that he tried&nbsp;almost all styles of composition—the drama, lyric poetry,&nbsp;the novel, and many others. In Alexander Griboiedoff&nbsp;(1794-1829) the Russians saw the writer of one of their&nbsp;most clever comedies </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Gore ot Uma),</span><span class="font0"> which may perhaps&nbsp;be translated “ The Misfortune of being too Clever ” (lit.&nbsp;“Grief out of Wit”). The fate of Griboiedoffwas sad;&nbsp;he was murdered in a riot at Teheran, where he was&nbsp;residing as Russian minister at the court of Persia. The&nbsp;poet is said to have had a presentiment of his fate and to&nbsp;have been unwilling to go. Pushkin, while travelling in&nbsp;the Caucasus, in the track of the army of Paskewitch, met&nbsp;the body of his friend, which was being carried to Tiflis&nbsp;for burial. The satirical powers of Griboiedoff come out&nbsp;in every line of his play; he was unquestionably a man of&nbsp;genius. A few words may be allowed to Ivan Kozloff&nbsp;(1774-1838), the author of some pretty original lyrics,&nbsp;and some translations from the English, among others&nbsp;Burns’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cotter’s Saturday Night.</span><span class="font0"> He became a cripple&nbsp;and blind, and his misfortunes elicited some cheering and&nbsp;sympathetic lines from Pushkin, which will always be read&nbsp;with pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since the death of Pushkin, the most eminent Russian poet is Lermontoff (1814-41); his life terminated, like&nbsp;that of his predecessor, in a duel. He has left us many&nbsp;exquisite lyrics, mostly written in a morbid and melancholy spirit. In quite a different vein is his clever imitation of a Russian bilina, “ Song about the Czar Ivan&nbsp;Vasilievich, the Young Oprichnik, and the Bold Merchant Kalashnikoff.” The poet was of Scotch extraction (Learmont), the termination being added to Russify&nbsp;his name. In one of his pieces he has alluded to his</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Caledonian ancestors. His chief poems are “ The Demon,” “The Novice” (“Mtziri,” a Georgian word), and “Hadji&nbsp;Abrek.” He also wrote a novel, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A Hero of our Time.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">He has faithfully reproduced in his poems the wild&nbsp;and varied scenery of the Caucasus and Georgia; from&nbsp;them he has drawn his inspiration—feeling, no doubt,&nbsp;that the flat grey landscapes of northern Russia offered&nbsp;no attractions to the poet. A genuine bard of the&nbsp;people, and one of their most truly national authors, was&nbsp;Koltzoff (1809-1842), the son of a tallow merchant of&nbsp;Voronezh. He has left us a few exquisite lyrics, which are&nbsp;to be found in all the collections of Russian poetry. He&nbsp;died of consumption after a protracted illness. Another&nbsp;poet who much resembled Koltzoff was Nikitin, born&nbsp;in the same town, Voronezh. His life was spent in&nbsp;poverty ; his father was an incurable drunkard, and&nbsp;brought his family to the greatest distress. Nikitin, to&nbsp;support his relations, was obliged to keep an inn ; this he&nbsp;was afterwards enabled to change for the more congenial&nbsp;occupation of a bookseller. He died in 1861. The&nbsp;novel in Russia has had its cultivators in Zagoskin and&nbsp;Lazhechnikoff, who imitated Sir Walter Scott. The most&nbsp;celebrated of the romances of Zagoskin was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Yuri Milo-slavski,</span><span class="font0"> a tale of the expulsion of the Poles from Russia&nbsp;in 1612. The book may even yet be read with interest;&nbsp;it gives a very spirited picture of the times ; unfortunately,&nbsp;as is but too often the case with the writings of Sir&nbsp;Walter Scott himself, a gloss is put upon the barbarity&nbsp;of the manners of the period, and the persons of the novel&nbsp;have sentiments and modes of expressing them which&nbsp;could only have existed about two centuries afterwards.&nbsp;There is also too much of the sentimentalism which was&nbsp;prevalent at the time when the author wrote. Among&nbsp;the better known productions of Lazhechnikoff are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Heretic</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Palace of Ice.</span><span class="font0"> A flashy but now&nbsp;forgotten writer of novels was Bulgarin, author of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ivan&nbsp;Vishigin,</span><span class="font0"> a work which once enjoyed considerable popularity. The first Russian novelist of great and original talent&nbsp;was Nicholas Gogol (1809-1852). In his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dead Souls</span><span class="font0"> he&nbsp;satirized all classes of society, some of the portraits being&nbsp;wonderfully vivid ; take, for example, that of Pliush-kin, the miser. Being a native of Little Russia, he is&nbsp;very fond of introducing descriptions of its scenery and&nbsp;the habits of the people, especially in such stories as the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Old-fashioned Household,</span><span class="font0"> or in the more powerful </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Taras&nbsp;Bulba.</span><span class="font0"> This last is a highly-wrought story, giving us a&nbsp;picture of the savage warfare carried on between the&nbsp;Cossacks and Poles. Taras is brave, but perhaps too much&nbsp;of a barbarian to be made interesting to Western readers.&nbsp;He reminds us of some of the heroes of the Cossack poet&nbsp;Shevchenko. Gogol was also the author of a good comedy,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Reviser,</span><span class="font0"> wherein the petty pilferings of Russian municipal authorities are satirized. In his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs of a Madman</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Portrait,</span><span class="font0"> he shows a weird and fantastic power&nbsp;which proves him to have been a man of strong imagination. The same may be said of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Cloak,</span><span class="font0"> and the&nbsp;curious tale </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vii</span><span class="font0"> (“The Demon”), where he gives us a&nbsp;picture of Kieff in the old days. He has very dexterously&nbsp;interwoven his tales with the traditions and superstitions&nbsp;of Little Russia. The fate of Gogol was sad ; he sank into&nbsp;religious melancholy, and ultimately into imbecility. He&nbsp;made great efforts to destroy all his writings, and indeed&nbsp;burnt most of the second part of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dead Souls</span><span class="font0"> ; only&nbsp;fragments have been preserved. His </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Confessions of an&nbsp;Author</span><span class="font0"> is the production of a mind verging on insanity.&nbsp;He died in 1852, aged forty-two. Since his time the&nbsp;novel has been very much cultivated in Russia, the school&nbsp;culminating in Ivan Turgenieff, but it is the school of&nbsp;Thackeray and Dickens, not that of Balzac and George&nbsp;Sand. The Russians seem to affect especially the realistic</span></p>
