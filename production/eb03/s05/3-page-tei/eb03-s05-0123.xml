In the year 1772 he retired to the country, where he afterwards ſpent the greater part of his life, and never reſumed his labours in the university. But though mathematics had now ceaſed to be his buſineſs, they continued to be his amuſement till a very few years before his death, which happened on the 23d oſ January 1785, at the age of 68.</p><p>The habits of ſtudy, in a man of original genius, are objects of curioſity, and deserve to be remembered. Concerning thoſe of Dr Stewart, his writings have made it unneceſſary to remark, that from his youth he had been accuſtomed to the moſt intenſe and continued application. In conſequence of this application, added to the natural vigour of his mind, he retained the memory of his diſcoveries in a manner that will hardly be believed. He rarely wrote down any of his inveſtigations till it became neceſſary to do ſo for the purpoſe of publication. When he discovered any propoſition, he would put down the enunciation with great accuracy, and on the ſame piece of paper would construct very neatly the figure to which it referred. To theſe he truſted for recalling to his mind at any future period the demonstration or the analyſis, however complicated it might be. Experience had taught him, that he might place this confidence in himſelf without any danger of diſappointment ; and for this singular power he was probably mote indebted to the activity of his invention than the mere tenaciouſneſs of his memory. Tho' he was extremely ſtudious, he read few books, and verified the obſervation of Μ. D’Alembert, that of all the men of letters, mathematicians read leaſt of the writings of one another. His own inveſtigations occupied him ſufficiently ; and indeed the world would have had reason to regret the miſapplication of his talents, had he employed in the mere acquiſition of knowledge that time which he could dedicate to works of invention.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stewart,</hi> in Scots law.

To theſe three ways of ſtigmatizing St John is ſuppoſed to refer (Rev. chap.  xiii. ver. 16, 17.).
