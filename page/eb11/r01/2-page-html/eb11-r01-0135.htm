<p><span class="font1">church and abbey of the Madonna de Montallegro, whose miraculous picture attracts pilgrims from all parts of Italy.&nbsp;Olives and other fruit are grown, and a brisk trade is done in&nbsp;olive oil. A mile to the south is Santa Margherita Ligure&nbsp;(pop. 7051), another winter resort, with a large 16th-century&nbsp;church. Both places are also frequented for sea-bathing in&nbsp;summer. Lace is made, while the men go in May to the coral&nbsp;fisheries off the Sardinian coast. To the south again is the&nbsp;small seaport of Portofino (the Roman </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Portus Delphini)</span><span class="font1"> under&nbsp;the south-east extremity of the promontory of Portofino&nbsp;(2010 ft.). On the way from S. Margherita to Portofino is the&nbsp;suppressed monastery of Cervara, in which Francis I. of France&nbsp;was confined after the battle of Pavia on his way to Madrid.&nbsp;At all these places arc beautiful villas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAPE (Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rapum</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rapa,</span><span class="font1"> turnip), in botany.—Several forms of plants included in the genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Brassica</span><span class="font1"> are cultivated for&nbsp;the oil which is present in their ripe seeds. The one most&nbsp;extensively grown for this purpose is known as colza, rape or&nbsp;coleseed, in Germany as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Raps </span><span class="font1">(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Brassica napus,</span><span class="font1"> var. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">oleifera):&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">its seeds contain from 30 to 45% of oil. The leaves are glaucous&nbsp;and smooth like those of a swede turnip. For a seed-crop&nbsp;rape is sown in July or early August in order that the plants&nbsp;may be strong enough to pass the winter uninjured. The&nbsp;young plants are thinned out to a width of 6 or 8 in. apart,&nbsp;and afterwards kept clean by hoeing. The foliage may be&nbsp;eaten down by sheep early in autumn, without injuring it&nbsp;for the production of a crop of seed. In spring the horse and&nbsp;hand hoe must be used, and the previous application of 1 cwt. or&nbsp;2 cwt. of guano will add to the productiveness of the crop. On&nbsp;good soil and in favourable seasons the yield sometimes reaches&nbsp;to 40 bushels per acre. The haulm and husks are either used&nbsp;for litter or burned, and the ashes spread upon the land. It&nbsp;makes good fuel for clay-burning. There is a “ summer ”&nbsp;variety of colza which is sown in April and ripens its seed in&nbsp;the same year. It docs not yield so much oil as the “ winter ”&nbsp;kind, but it will grow on soil in poorer condition. Neither of&nbsp;these is much grown in Great Britain for the production of&nbsp;oil, but the “ winter ’’ variety is very extensively grown as green&nbsp;food for sheep. For this purpose it is generally sown at short&nbsp;intervals throughout the summer to provide a succession of&nbsp;fodder. It is peculiarly adapted for peaty soils, and is accordingly a favourite crop in the fen lands of England, and on&nbsp;recently reclaimed mosses and moors elsewhere. Its growth&nbsp;is greatly stimulated by the ashes resulting from the practice&nbsp;of paring and burning. Its highly nutritious leaves and stems&nbsp;are usually consumed by folding the sheep upon it where it&nbsp;grows, there is no green food upon which they fatten faster.&nbsp;Occasionally it is carried to the homestead, and used with&nbsp;other forage in carrying out the system of soiling cattle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The wild form </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Brassica campestris,</span><span class="font1"> the wild coleseed, colza or kohlsaat, of the fields of England and many parts of Europe,&nbsp;is sometimes cultivated on the European continent for its seed,&nbsp;which, however, is inferior in value to rape as an oil-yielding&nbsp;product.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In addition to the previously mentioned rape, a variety of another species (or subspecies) of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Brassica,</span><span class="font1"> namely, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Brassica&nbsp;rapa,</span><span class="font1"> var. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">oleifera (Rübsen</span><span class="font1"> in Germany), is grown for its oil-yielding seeds. The leaves in a young state are not glaucous,&nbsp;but sap-green in colour and rough, being very similar to those&nbsp;of the turnip, to which the plant is closely related. Both&nbsp;winter and summer varieties are grown; they are rarely cultivated in Britain. The oil is similar to that in the true colza&nbsp;seeds but the plants do not yield so much per acre as the latter:&nbsp;they are, however, hardier and more adapted for cultivation&nbsp;on poor sandy soils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAPE (from Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rapere,</span><span class="font1"> to seize), in law, the crime of having carnal knowledge of a woman by a man, not her husband,&nbsp;forcibly and unlawfully against her will. Under the Mosaic&nbsp;law, rape was punished with death, if the damsel was betrothed&nbsp;to another man, and with a fine of fifty shekels if not so betrothed, while in this case, also, she was to be the wife of the&nbsp;ravisher all the days of his life (Deut. xxii. 25). The Roman&nbsp;civil law punished rape with death and confiscation of goods&nbsp;(Cod. L. IX. tit. 13). In England, under the Saxon law—&nbsp;adopted, probably, from a Teutonic code—death was also the&nbsp;penalty, but under the Normans this was changed to the loss&nbsp;of both eyes and castration; this punishment remained in&nbsp;force until after the time of Bracton </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(de Coronâ,</span><span class="font1"> f. 147). The&nbsp;statute of Westminster I. (1275) reduced the offence to a tres-pass, with a penalty of two years’ imprisonment and a fine at&nbsp;the king’s will. This lenity, it is said, produced terrible consequences, and, accordingly, the statute of Westminster II.&nbsp;(1285) again declared the offence a felony, with, however,&nbsp;benefit of clergy. This was the state of the law until 1575,&nbsp;when the punishment was made more severe by taking away&nbsp;the benefit of clergy. The offence remained capital until the&nbsp;Offences against the Person Act 1861, by which and subsequent&nbsp;amending acts it is now regulated. The present punishment&nbsp;is penal servitude for life or for not less than three years or&nbsp;imprisonment with or without hard labour for not over two&nbsp;years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The law of England (differing in this respect from the civil law) regards as immaterial whether the woman is chaste or unchaste,&nbsp;married or single, provided the offence has been committed forcibly&nbsp;and without her consent. The offence is complete if consent is&nbsp;extorted by means of threats of death or immediate bodily harm,&nbsp;by fraud or by false pretences or representation, such as the impersonation of a woman’s husband (Criminal Law Amendment&nbsp;Act 1885).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since the passing of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, it is a felony, entailing the same punishment as rape, to have carnal&nbsp;knowledge of a girl under 13 years, whether she consent or not.&nbsp;Between 13 and 16 years of age it is a criminal offence&nbsp;punishable by two years* imprisonment, whether consent is given&nbsp;or not, and even if there be solicitation; but if the jury is satisfied&nbsp;that the person charged has reasonable cause to believe the girl&nbsp;to be over 16 years, the accused is entitled to be acquitted.&nbsp;Prosecution must be within three months of the offence. The&nbsp;administration of any drug or matter, with intent, by producing&nbsp;stupor, to facilitate the accomplishment of the crime, is an offence&nbsp;punishable by two years’ imprisonment. On indictment for rape&nbsp;there may be an acquittal on the actual charge, but a conviction&nbsp;either of the attempt or of an indecent assault.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In charges of rape, from the nature of the offence, the important witness is the woman, and it is essential, apart from medical evidence&nbsp;(see Medical Jurisprudence), that her story be corroborated by&nbsp;evidence implicating the accused. The following points have, of&nbsp;necessity, to be considered. (1) As to the general credibility of&nbsp;the witness and how far her story is to be believed ; evidence,&nbsp;therefore, may be given to show that she is of immoral character.&nbsp;(2) As to whether she has made complaint immediately after the&nbsp;alleged outrage and to whom. (3) As to the place where the outrage&nbsp;was alleged to have been committed and the possibility of her being&nbsp;heard if she cried out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the United States, rape is universally treated as a felony, and the punishment is either death, imprisonment for life,&nbsp;or imprisonment for a number of years, varying in the different&nbsp;states. In the case of offences against young girls, there is a&nbsp;divergence in the various states as to the age of consent, though&nbsp;the trend of legislation has been to raise it. In North and&nbsp;South Carolina, and Georgia, the age of consent is as low as&nbsp;10 years, and in Kentucky and Louisiana, 12 years. In&nbsp;nineteen states the age of consent is 14 years. In one (Texas)&nbsp;15 years. In six, it is 16 years. In Wyoming, New York,&nbsp;Colorado and Kansas it is as high as 18 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The essential facts to be proven in order to constitute this crime are the same as in England, but in many of the states&nbsp;the uncorroborated evidence of the woman is sufficient to sustain&nbsp;a conviction. This is so in California, Arizona, Idaho, Missouri,&nbsp;Kentucky, Michigan, Illinois, Oklahoma, &amp;c. [1904; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Brenton&nbsp;v. Territory,</span><span class="font1"> 78 Pac. Rep. 83]. In New York corroboration is&nbsp;required [Penal Code §283]. In Nebraska also evidence corroborating the prosecutrix is necessary [1907; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Burk v. State,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">n2 N.W. Rep. 573]. In Texas it is no defence for accused to&nbsp;prove that he believed the prosecutrix to be over 15 years of&nbsp;age, the age of consent [1907; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Robertson v. State,</span><span class="font1"> 102 So. W. Rep.&nbsp;1130], and the crime is punishable with death [1903; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reyna</span><span class="font1"> v.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">State,</span><span class="font1"> 75 So. W. Rep. 25], as also apparently it is in the Indian&nbsp;country [</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">U.S.</span><span class="font1"> v. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Partello,</span><span class="font1"> 48 Fed. R. 670 U.S. Rev. Stats. §5345],&nbsp;also in Alabama [Criminal Code, §5444].</span></p>
