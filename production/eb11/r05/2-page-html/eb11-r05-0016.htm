<p><span class="font0">appear to have been the work of a pre-Christian Celtic race. Many objects in bronze and iron and fragments of hand-made&nbsp;pottery have been found in and near these towers, all bearing&nbsp;witness of a very early date. (See Anderson, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scotland in Pagan&nbsp;Times,</span><span class="font0"> 1883, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scotland in Early Christian Times,</span><span class="font0"> 1881.)&nbsp;The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">nuraghi</span><span class="font0"> of Sardinia are described in the article on that&nbsp;island. During the 6th century church towers at and near&nbsp;Ravenna were usually built round in plan, and not unlike&nbsp;those of Ireland in their proportions. The finest existing&nbsp;example is that which stands by the church of S. Apollinarc&nbsp;in Classe, the old port of the city of Ravenna (see Basilica,&nbsp;fig. 8). It is of brick, divided into nine storeys, with singlelight windows below, three-light windows in the upper storeys,&nbsp;and two-lights in the intermediate ones. The.most magnificent&nbsp;example of a round tower is the well-known leaning tower of&nbsp;Pisa, begun in the year 1174. It is richly decorated with&nbsp;tiers of open marble arcades, supported on free columns. The&nbsp;circular plan was much used by Moslem races for their minarets.&nbsp;The finest of these is the 13th-century minar of Kutb at&nbsp;Old Delhi, built of limestone with bands of marble. It is&nbsp;richly fluted on plan, and when complete was at least 250 ft.&nbsp;high.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The best account of the Irish round towers is that given by Petrie in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ecclesiastical Architecture of Ireland</span><span class="font0"> (Dublin, 1845). See also&nbsp;Keane, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Towers and Temples of Ancient Ireland</span><span class="font0"> (Dublin, 1850);&nbsp;Brash, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ecclesiastical Architecture of Ireland</span><span class="font0"> (Dublin, 1875); and&nbsp;Stokes, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Early Architecture in Ireland</span><span class="font0"> (Dublin, 1878).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J.

<p><span class="font0">ROUS, FRANCIS (1579-1659), English Puritan, was born at Dittisham in Devon in 1579, and educated at Oxford (Broad-gates Hall, afterwards Pembroke College) and at Leiden,&nbsp;graduating at the former in January 1596-97, and at the latter&nbsp;thirteen months afterwards. For some years he lived in&nbsp;seclusion in Cornwall and occupied himself with theological&nbsp;studies, producing among other books </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Arte of Happines&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1619) and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Testis Veritatis,</span><span class="font0"> a reply to Richard Montagu’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Appdlo Caesarem.</span><span class="font0"> He entered parliament in 1625 as member&nbsp;for Truro, and continued to represent that or some neighbouring west country constituency in such parliaments as were&nbsp;summoned till his death. He obtained many offices under&nbsp;the Commonwealth, among them that of provost of Eton&nbsp;College. At first a Presbyterian, he afterwards joined the&nbsp;Independents. In 1657 he was made a lord of parliament.&nbsp;He died at Acton in January 1658-59. The subjective cast&nbsp;of his piety is reflected in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mystical Marriage . . . betweene&nbsp;a Soule and her Saviour</span><span class="font0"> (1635), but he is best known by his&nbsp;metrical version of the Psalms (1643), which was approved by&nbsp;the Westminster Assembly and (in a revised form) is still used&nbsp;in the Scottish Presbyterian churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROUS, HENRY JOHN (1795-1877), British admiral and sportsman, was born on the 23rd of January 1795, the second&nbsp;son of the 1st earl of Stradbroke. lie was educated at Westminster School, and entered the British navy in 1808, serving&nbsp;as a midshipman in the expedition to Flushing. He was afterwards appointed to the “ Bacchante,” and received a medal&nbsp;for bravery in various actions and expeditions. In 1823 he&nbsp;was made captain, and served in the Indian and New Holland&nbsp;stations from 1823 to 1829. In 1834 he was appointed to&nbsp;the command of the “ Pique,” a 36-gun frigate, which ran&nbsp;ashore on the coast of Labrador and was much damaged.&nbsp;Rous, however, brought her across the Atlantic with a sprung&nbsp;foremast and without keel, forefoot or rudder, and though&nbsp;the ship was making 23 ins. of water an hour. Rous, always&nbsp;fond of sport, retired from the navy, and became in 1838 a&nbsp;steward of the Jockey Club, a position which he held almost&nbsp;uninterruptedly to his death. In 1855 he was appointed&nbsp;public handicapper. He managed the duke of Redford’s&nbsp;stables at Newmarket for many years, and wrote a work on&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Laws and Practice of Horse Racing</span><span class="font0"> that procured for him&nbsp;the title of <sup>a</sup> the Blackstone of the Turf.” In 1841 he was&nbsp;returned M.P. for Westminster, and in 1846 Sir Robert Peel&nbsp;made him a lord of the admiralty. He died on the 19th of&nbsp;June 1877.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>

<p><span class="font0">ROUSSEAU, JACQUES (1630-1693), French painter, a member of a Huguenot family, was born at Paris in 1630. He&nbsp;was remarkable as a painter of decorative landscapes and&nbsp;classic ruins, somewhat in the style of Canaletto, but without&nbsp;his delicacy of touch; he appears also to have been influenced&nbsp;by Nicolas Poussin. While young Rousseau went to Rome,&nbsp;where he spent some years in painting the ancient ruins,&nbsp;together with the surrounding landscapes. He thus formed&nbsp;his style, which was artificial and conventionally decorative.&nbsp;His colouring for the most part is unpleasing, partly owing&nbsp;to his violent treatment of skies with crude blues and orange,&nbsp;and his chiaroscuro usually is much exaggerated. On his&nbsp;return to Paris he soon became distinguished as a painter, and&nbsp;was employed by Louis XIV. to decorate the walls of his&nbsp;palaces at St Germain and Marly. He was soon admitted&nbsp;a member of the French Academy of the Fine Arts, but on&nbsp;the revocation of the edict of Nantes he was obliged to take&nbsp;refuge in Holland, and his name was struck off the Academy&nbsp;roll. From Holland he was invited to England by the duke&nbsp;of Montague, who employed him, together with other French&nbsp;painters, to paint the walls of his palace, Montague House&nbsp;(on the site of which is now the British Museum). Rousseau&nbsp;was also employed to paint architectural subjects and landscapes in the palace of Hampton Court, where many of his&nbsp;decorative panels still exist. He spent the latter part of his&nbsp;life in London, where he died in 1693.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Besides being a painter in oil and fresco Rousseau was an etcher of some ability; many etchings by his hand from the works of the&nbsp;Caracci and from his own designs still exist; they are vigorous,&nbsp;though coarse in execution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROUSSEAU, JEAN BAPTISTE (1671-1741), French poet, was bom at Paris on the 6th of April 1671; he died at Brussels&nbsp;on the 17th of March 1741. The son of a shoemaker, he was&nbsp;well educated and early gained favour with Boileau, who encouraged him to write. He began with the theatre, for which&nbsp;he had no aptitude. A one-act comedy, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Le Café,</span><span class="font0"> failed in 1694,&nbsp;and he was not much happier with a more ambitious play,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Le Flatteur</span><span class="font0"> (1696), or with the opera of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vénus el Adonis</span><span class="font0"> (1697).&nbsp;He tried in 1700 another comedy, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Le Capricieux,</span><span class="font0"> which had&nbsp;the same fate. He then went with Tallard as an attache to&nbsp;London, and, in days when literature still led to high position,&nbsp;seemed likely to achieve success. His misfortunes began with&nbsp;a club squabble at the Café Laurent, which was much frequented&nbsp;by literary men, and where Rousseau indulged in lampoons on&nbsp;his companions. A shower of libellous and sometimes obscene&nbsp;verses was written by or attributed to him, and at last he&nbsp;was turned out of the café. At the same time his poems,&nbsp;as yet only singly printed or in manuscript, acquired him a&nbsp;great reputation, due to the dearth of genuine lyrical poetry&nbsp;between Racine and Chénier. He had in 1701 been made a&nbsp;member of the Académie des inscriptions; he had been offered,&nbsp;though he had not accepted, profitable places in the revenue&nbsp;department; he had become a favourite of the libertine but&nbsp;influential coterie of the Temple; and in 1710 he presented&nbsp;himself as a candidate for the Académie française. Then&nbsp;began the second chapter of an extraordinary history of the&nbsp;animosities of authors. A copy of verses, more offensive&nbsp;than ever, was handed round, and gossip maintained that&nbsp;Rousseau was its author. Legal proceedings of various kinds&nbsp;followed, and Rousseau ascribed the lampoon to Joseph Saurin.&nbsp;In 1712 Rousseau was prosecuted for defamation of character,&nbsp;and, on his non-appearance in court, was condemned </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">par&nbsp;contumace</span><span class="font0"> to perpetual exile. He spent the rest of his life&nbsp;in foreign countries except for a clandestine visit to Paris&nbsp;in 1738, refusing to accept the permission to return which was&nbsp;offered him in 1716 because it was not accompanied by complete&nbsp;rehabilitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Prince Eugène and then other persons of distinction took him under their protection during his exile, and he printed at Soleure the&nbsp;first edition of his poetical works. Voltaire and he met at Brussels</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
