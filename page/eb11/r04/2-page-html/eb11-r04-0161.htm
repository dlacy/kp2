<p><span class="font0">thunders of the church, he marched against Anagni, the pope's birthplace, and Alexander was quickly obliged to humiliate&nbsp;himself before the senator of Rome. Brancaleone next set to&nbsp;work to destroy the fortified towers of the nobility, and in razing&nbsp;them to the ground ruined many of the adjacent dwellings.&nbsp;Accordingly, a considerable number of nobles became homeless&nbsp;exiles. In 1258, while engaged on the siege of Corneto, Brancaleone was attacked by a violent fever, and, being carried back&nbsp;to Rome, died on the Capitoline Hill. Thus ended the career of&nbsp;a truly remarkable statesman. He was succeeded by his uncle,&nbsp;Castellano degli Andalô, who, lacking the political genius of his&nbsp;nephew, only retained office until the following spring (1259),&nbsp;in the midst of fierce and perpetual disturbances. Then the&nbsp;people, being bribed by the pope, joined with the nobles and&nbsp;drove him away. His life too was saved by having followed&nbsp;his nephew’s shrewd plan of sending hostages to Bologna. Two&nbsp;senators of Roman birth were next elected; and on the death&nbsp;of Alexander IV.a French pope was chosen, UrbanIV. (1261-64),&nbsp;thus giving fresh predominance in the church to the anti-Swabian policy. But the internal disturbances of the city soon&nbsp;■drove Urban to flight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At this period the fall of the empire had induced many Italian republics to seek strength by placing their governments in the&nbsp;hands of some prince willing to swear respect to their laws and&nbsp;to undertake their defence against neighbouring states and the&nbsp;pope. In Rome the Guelphs and Ghibellines proposed various&nbsp;■candidates for this office, and after many fierce quarrels ended&nbsp;by electing a committee of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">boni homines,</span><span class="font0"> charged with the revision&nbsp;■of the statutes, reorganization of the city, and choice of a senator.&nbsp;This committee sat for more than a year without nominating&nbsp;any one, so, the Guelph party being now predominant, and all&nbsp;being wearied of this provisional state of things, the majority&nbsp;agreed on the election as senator of Charles of Anjou, who, at&nbsp;the pope’s summons, was already preparing for the&nbsp;conquest of Naples. The Romans thought that he&nbsp;would defend Rome against the pope, and the pope&nbsp;would defend Rome against him; and by thus taking advantage&nbsp;of either’s jealousy the citizens hoped to keep their republic intact.&nbsp;In fact, although Urban IV. had incited Charles to attack&nbsp;Naples, he was by no means willing to see him established as&nbsp;master in Rome. He accordingly declared that, if Charles&nbsp;really wished to obtain the Neapolitan crown, he must only accept&nbsp;the offered dignity pending the conquest of that kingdom.&nbsp;And he must likewise promise to recognize the supremacy of&nbsp;the pope over the senate. Charles soothed him with the amplest&nbsp;verbal promises, but in fact accepted the senatorship for life. In&nbsp;1265, when Urban was succeeded by Clement IV. (1265-68), who&nbsp;as a Provençal was a subject of Charles, the latter entered Rome&nbsp;and was immediately made senator. Seven days later (28th of&nbsp;June) he received the investiture of the Neapolitan kingdom, and&nbsp;in the following January its crown. On the 26th of February&nbsp;1266 the battle of Benevento was fought, and, the valiant&nbsp;Manfred being killed, the triumph of the Guelph Angevins in Italy&nbsp;was assured. Then, at the urgent command of the pope,&nbsp;Charles was forced to resign the senatorship in the May of&nbsp;the same year. Two Romans were elected in his stead, but&nbsp;soon fell out with the pope, because the Guelph nobles again tried&nbsp;to exercise tyranny. The people, however, profited by these&nbsp;disturbances to rise on its own account, and formed a democratic&nbsp;government of twenty-six </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">boni homines</span><span class="font0"> with Angelo Capocci,&nbsp;a Ghibelline, as its captain. By this government Don&nbsp;Henry, son of Ferdinand III. of Castile, was elected&nbsp;senator; and he came to Rome for the purpose of promoting a Ghibelline and Swabian policy in favour of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Conradin, who was preparing for conflict. The rule of the new senator was very energetic, for he kept down the clergy, subdued&nbsp;the Campagna, persecuted the Guelph nobles, made alliance with&nbsp;the Tuscan Ghibellines, forcibly drove back the troops of King&nbsp;Charles, who was advancing towards Rome, and gave a splendid&nbsp;reception to Conradin. But the battle of Tagliacozzo (23rd of&nbsp;August 1268), followed by the murder of Conradin, proved fatal&nbsp;to the Ghibelline party. Charles was re-elected senator immediately after the battle, and the pope confirmed his powers for&nbsp;a term of ten years, after having already named him imperial&nbsp;vicar in Tuscany. On the 16th of September Charles for the&nbsp;second time took possession of the Capitol, and ruled Rome&nbsp;firmly by means of vice-governors or vicars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Swabian line was now extinct, and in Charles’s hands the Neapolitan kingdom had become a fief of the church. The&nbsp;empire had fallen so low as to be no longer formidable. Now&nbsp;therefore was the moment for treating with it in order to restrain&nbsp;Charles, and also for making use of the French king to keep the&nbsp;empire in check. And this was the j&gt;oiicy of Nicholas III.&nbsp;(1277-80), who hastened to extract advantageous promises&nbsp;from Rudolph of Habsburg, the new candidate for the imperial&nbsp;crown. In 1278, the ten years’ term having expired, he deprived&nbsp;Charles of the senatorship and appointed Rudolph vicar of&nbsp;Tuscany. After declaring that he left to the people the right of&nbsp;electing the senator, he promulgated a new constitution (18th of&nbsp;July 1278) which, while confirming the rights of the church over&nbsp;the city, prohibited the election of any foreign emperor, prince,&nbsp;marquis, count or baron as senator of Rome. Thus the&nbsp;Colonna, Savelli, Orsini, Annibaldi and other Roman nobles&nbsp;again rose to power, and the republic was again endangered and&nbsp;plunged in disorder. The Romans then gave the&nbsp;reconstitution of the city into the pope’s hands by&nbsp;yielding to him the right of nominating senators, declaring, however, that this was a personal concession&nbsp;to himself, and not to the popes in general. So&nbsp;Nicholas proceeded to name senators, alternating a Colonna&nbsp;with an Orsini, or simultaneously choosing one of each fafc-tion. The same power over the senate was granted with the&nbsp;same restriction to Martin IV. (1281-85), and he at once reelected Charles of Anjou. Thus, greatly to the disgust of the&nbsp;Romans, the Capitol was again invaded by French vicars,&nbsp;notaries, judges and soldiery. But the terrible blow dealt at&nbsp;Charles’s power by the Sicilian Vespers (31st of March 1282)&nbsp;resounded even in Rome. The Orsini, backed by the people,&nbsp;rose to arms, massacred the French garrison, and quickly&nbsp;re-established a popular government. Giovanni Cencio, a&nbsp;kinsman of the Orsini, was elected captain and defender of the&nbsp;people, and ruled the city with the co-operation of the senator&nbsp;and a council of priors of the gilds. This government was of&nbsp;brief duration, for, although the pope had professed his willingness to tolerate the experiment, he quickly arranged fresh&nbsp;terms, and, forsaking Charles of Anjou, again nominated two&nbsp;Roman senators. Pope and king both died in 1285, and&nbsp;Nicholas IV. (1288-92), also holding sway over the senate,&nbsp;favoured the Colonna in order to curb the growing mastery of&nbsp;the Orsini. But thus there were two powerful houses instead of&nbsp;one. In fact, Giovanni Colonna, when elected senator, ruled&nbsp;from the Capitol as an independent sovereign, conducted in&nbsp;person the campaign against Viterbo, and subjected that city&nbsp;to the republic on the 3rd of May 1291.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When one of the Gaetani, Boniface VIII. (1294-1303), was raised to the papal chair, the extent of the Colonnas’ power&nbsp;became evident to all. Boniface opposed them in&nbsp;order to aggrandize his own kin, and they showed&nbsp;equal virulence in return. The Cardinals Colonna&nbsp;refused to acknowledge him as the legitimate pope, and he&nbsp;excommunicated them and proclaimed a crusade against their&nbsp;house. Even after he had subdued them and destroyed&nbsp;Palestrina, their principal fief, the drama did not yet come&nbsp;to an end. Boniface had a very lofty conception of the church,&nbsp;and desired to establish her supremacy over the state. The&nbsp;king of France (Philip the Fair) believed, on the contrary,&nbsp;that the Angevin successes entitled him to fill the place in&nbsp;Italy vacated by the Swabians, and to play the master there.&nbsp;This led to a tremendous contest in which all the French sided&nbsp;with their king. And shortly afterwards a plot was hatched&nbsp;against the pope by the agents of France and the Colonna.&nbsp;These determined enemies of the pope met with much favour&nbsp;in Rome, on account of the general irritation against the&nbsp;Gaetani and the enormous power conferred on them by Boniface.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
