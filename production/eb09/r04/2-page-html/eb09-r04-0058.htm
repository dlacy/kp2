<p><span class="font0">quarters of corn and 972,000 quarters of potatoes. The area under cultivation and the crops themselves are increasing, as also is the&nbsp;export of corn. But even here, in one of the wealthiest governments of Russia, the situation of the peasants is far from satisfactory. Cattle-breeding is rapidly falling olf on account of want&nbsp;of pasturo lands, but hay, which is abundant, especially on the rich&nbsp;meadow lands of the Oka, is exported. In 1882 there were&nbsp;283,500 horses, 262,200 cattle, and 839,600 sheep, the figures&nbsp;having been 446,000, 297,000, and 847,000 respectively in 1858.&nbsp;Iu the northern part of the government various industries are&nbsp;carried on, such as boatbuilding, the preparation of pitch and tar,&nbsp;the manufacture of wooden vessels, sledges, &amp;c. Various other&nbsp;petty trades, such as weaving, lace-making, and boot-making, are&nbsp;combined with agriculture. Manufactures also have lately begun&nbsp;to make progress, and in 1882 their aggregate production reached&nbsp;13,000,000 roubles (cotton and flax-spinning mills, glass-works&nbsp;and metal-ware works, and distilleries, the last-named producing&nbsp;to the value of 1,850,000 roubles). Trade, especially in com and&nbsp;other agricultural produce and in merchandise manufactured in&nbsp;the villages, is very active. The railway from Ryazan to Moscow&nbsp;is one of the most important in Russia, from the amount of goods&nbsp;carried from the south-east Steppe governments. The Oka is&nbsp;another artery of traffic, the aggregate amount shipped to or&nbsp;sent from its ports within Ryazan reaching 3,634,000 cwts. in&nbsp;1880. The government is divided into twelve districts, the chief&nbsp;towns of which, with their populations in 1883, are subjoined :&nbsp;Ryazah (30,325 inhabitants), Dankoff (2475), Egorievsk (6055),&nbsp;Kasimoff (15,260), Mikhailoff (2720), Pronsk (1740), Ranenburg&nbsp;(4500), Ryazhsk (4265), Sapojok (2670), Skopin (10,260), Spassk&nbsp;(4320), and Zaraisk (5870). Ranenburg, Skopin, and Zaraisk are&nbsp;important markets for corn and hemp. Several villages, such as&nbsp;Muraevnya, Dyedinovo (6600) and Lovtsy (loading places on the&nbsp;Oka), and Ukolovo (market for corn), have more commerce and&nbsp;industry than the district towns. Large villages are numerous,&nbsp;about sixty having each from 2500 to 7000 inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Slavonians began to colonize the region of Ryazafi as early as the 9th century, penetrating thither both from the north-west&nbsp;(Great Russians) and from the Dnieper (Little Russians). As early&nbsp;ns the 10th century the principality of Murom and Ryazafi is&nbsp;mentioned in the chronicles. During the following centuries&nbsp;this principality increased both in extent and in wealth and&nbsp;included parts of what are now the governments of Kaluga and&nbsp;Moscow. Owing to the fertility of the soil, its Russian population rapidly increased, while the Finnish stems which formerly&nbsp;inhabited it migrated farther east, or became merged among the&nbsp;Slavonians. A dozen towns, all fortified and commercial, are&nbsp;mentioned as belonging to the principality towards the end of the&nbsp;12th century. The Mongolian invasion stopped all this development. The horsemen of Batu burned and destroyed several towns&nbsp;in 1237, and killed many people, desolating the country. The&nbsp;principality, however, still continued to exist ; its great princes&nbsp;strongly opposed the annexation plans of Moscow, making alliance&nbsp;with the Mongols and with Lithuania, but they succumbed, and,&nbsp;the last of them, Ivan, having been imprisoned in Moscow, his&nbsp;principality was definitively annexed in 1517.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RYAZAN, capital of the above government, lies 119 miles to the south-east of Moscow, on the elevated right&nbsp;bank of the Trubej, a mile above its junction with the&nbsp;Oka. A wide prairie dotted with large villages, being the&nbsp;bottom of a former lake, spreads out from the base of the&nbsp;crag on which Ryazan stands, and has the aspect of an&nbsp;immense lake when it is inundated in the spring. Except&nbsp;one or two streets, the town is badly built, chiefly of wood,&nbsp;and ill-paved. It has often suffered from fire, and has few&nbsp;remains of former days. The large church of Uspensk&nbsp;dates from 1770. Those of Arkhangelsk and Kresto-vozdvijensk have preserved, however, their old architecture, though obliterated to some extent by subsequent&nbsp;repairs, as also the archiépiscopal palace, formerly the&nbsp;“terem” of the great princes. The industries are undeveloped, and the trade has less importance than might&nbsp;be expected from the position of the town in so rich a region.&nbsp;It is, however, an important railway centre, no less than&nbsp;15,000,000 cwts., chiefly of corn, being brought from the&nbsp;south-east and sent on to Moscow, while nearly 3,390,000&nbsp;cwts. of various manufactured and grocery wares are conveyed in the opposite direction. The loading place on the&nbsp;Oka also has some importance. The population, 30,325&nbsp;in 1883, is increasing but slowly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The capital of Ryazafi principality was Ryazafi—now Old Ryazafi, a village close to Spassk, also on the Oka. It is mentioned in&nbsp;annals as early as 1097, but continued to be the chief town of the&nbsp;principality only until the 14th century. In the 11th century&nbsp;one of the Kieff princes—probably Yaroslaff Svyatoslavitch in&nbsp;1095—founded, on the banks of a small lake, a fort which received&nbsp;tho name of Pereyaslaff-Ryazaiiskiy. In 1294 (or in 1335) the&nbsp;bishop of Murom, compelled to leave his own town and probably&nbsp;following the usual policy of that epoch,—that of selecting a new&nbsp;town with no municipal traditions, as the nucleus of a new state,&nbsp;—settled in Pereyaslaff-Ryazanskiy, and thus gave new importance&nbsp;to this formerly insignificant settlement. The great princes of&nbsp;Ryazaft followed his example and by-and-by completely abandoned&nbsp;the old republican town of Ryazan, transferring also its name to&nbsp;Pereyaslair-Ryazanskiy. In 1300 a congress of Russian princes&nbsp;was held there, and in the following year the town was taken by&nbsp;the Moscow prince. It continued, however, to be the residence&nbsp;of the Ryazafi princes until 1517. In 1365 and 1377 it was&nbsp;plundered and burned by Tartars, but in the two following&nbsp;centuries (in 1460, 1513, 1521, and 1564) it was strong enough&nbsp;to repel them. Earthen walls with towers were erected after&nbsp;1301 ; and in the 17th century a “kreml” still stood on the high&nbsp;crag above the Trubej. Ryazan became chief town of the Ryazan&nbsp;lieutenancy in 1778.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RYBINSK, or RuIbinsk, though but a district town of the government of Yaroslavl, with a permanent population&nbsp;(1883) of only 18,900, is, as being virtually the port of&nbsp;St Petersburg on the Volga, one of the most important&nbsp;towns of the northern part of Central Russia. It lies 54&nbsp;miles to the north-west of Yaroslavl, and is connected by&nbsp;rail (186 miles) with Bologoye, on the line between St&nbsp;Petersburg and Moscow. It derives its importance from&nbsp;its situation on the Volga, opposite the mouth of the&nbsp;Sheksna,—one of those tributaries which, flowing from&nbsp;the north-west, have since the dawn of Russian history&nbsp;connected the Volga with the regions around Lake&nbsp;Ladoga. Russians settled there as early as the 12th&nbsp;century, or perhaps earlier ; subsequently it seems to&nbsp;have become a mere fishing station under Moscow, with&nbsp;perhaps some shipbuilding. It became a considerable&nbsp;centre for traffic when the Vyshnevolotsk, Tikhvinsk, and&nbsp;AIariinsk canal systems, connecting St Petersburg with&nbsp;the Volga, were opened. The cargoes of the larger boats&nbsp;from the lower Volga, consisting mainly of corn and flour,&nbsp;as also of salt, spirits, potash, and tallow, are here transferred to smaller boats capable of accomplishing the&nbsp;navigation to St Petersburg, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">vice versa.</span><span class="font1"> The amount&nbsp;of goods thus transhipped is estimated at 16,000,000&nbsp;cwts., worth 32,800,000 roubles. Since the opening of&nbsp;the line to Bologoye, a large proportion of this merchandise&nbsp;is sent to St Petersburg by rail (9,293,000 cwts. in 1880).&nbsp;The total number of boats visiting Rybinsk annually is&nbsp;estimated at 5000 to 7000, their aggregate cargoes&nbsp;amounting to nearly 20,000,000 cwts. (about 40,000,000&nbsp;roubles). Upwards of 100,000 labourers (male and female)&nbsp;assemble at Rybinsk during the navigation, and the number of vessels is so great as to cover the Volga and the&nbsp;Sheksna like a bridge. Besides the business of transhipment, Rybinsk has an active trade in corn, hemp, &amp;c., from&nbsp;the neighbouring districts. The town is but poorly built,&nbsp;and its sanitary condition leaves very much to be desired,&nbsp;especially in summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RYCAUT, or Ricaut, Sir Paul (d. 1700), traveller and diplomatist, was the tenth son of Sir Peter Ricaut, a&nbsp;Royalist who on account of his support of King Charles&nbsp;had to pay a composition of .£1500. The son was admitted&nbsp;a scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1647, and took&nbsp;his B. A. degree in 1650. After travelling in Europe and&nbsp;in various parts of Asia and Africa, he in 1661 accompanied as secretary the earl of Winchelsea, ambassador&nbsp;extraordinary to Turkey.
