                after&nbsp;describing a great curve to the east at Tsaritsyn, approaching
                the&nbsp;Volga, with which it is connected by a railway (40 miles).
                Its&nbsp;navigation is of great importance (5<sup>-</sup>4 million cwts. shipped,
                and&nbsp;5Ί discharged), especially for goods brought from the Volga, and&nbsp;its

        <p><span class="font1">. Almost every geological formation, from the oldest up to the most
                recent, is met with in Russia ; but, as they are almost&nbsp;horizontal, they for
                the most part cover one Another over immense&nbsp;spaces, so that the lower ones
                appear only at the bottom of the&nbsp;deeper valleys, and the oldest are seen only
                on the borders of the&nbsp;great Russian plain.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">At the beginning of the Palæozoic period only a very few portions of
                what is now Russia—Finland, namely, and parts of Olonetz—&nbsp;rose above the
                surface of the sea ; but, as the result of a gradual&nbsp;upheaval continued through
                Palæozoic times, it is supposed that&nbsp;at the end of this epoch Russia was a
                continent not greatly differing from tho present one. In DIesozoic times the sea
                began again&nbsp;to invade it, but, while in the preceding period the
                oscillations&nbsp;resolved themselves into a gradual upheaval extending from
                west&nbsp;to east, in Mesozoic times the upheaval went on from north-west&nbsp;to
                south-east. The Dlcsozoic sea, however, did not extend beyond&nbsp;what is now
                central Russia, and did not cover the “ Devonian&nbsp;plateau” of western Russia,
                which remained a continent from the&nbsp;Carboniferous epoch. A gradual rising of
                the continent followed,&nbsp;and was continued through Neozoic times, with perhaps a
                limited&nbsp;subsidence in tho Post-Glacial period, when the actual seas
                extended&nbsp;their narrow gulfs up the valleys now occupied by the great
                rivers.&nbsp;During the first part of the Glacial period, Russia seems to
                have&nbsp;been covered by an immense ice-sheet, which extended also
                over&nbsp;central Germany, and of which the eastern limits cannot yet
                be&nbsp;determined.</span></p>

                consist for the most part of red&nbsp;and grey gneisses and gτanulites, with

                of a series of Unfossiliferous crystalline slates.&nbsp;The Cambrian is represented

        <p><span class="font1">The Silurian system is widely developed, and it is most probable
                that, with the exception of the Archæan continents of Finland and&nbsp;the Urals,
                the Silurian sea covered the whole of Russia. Being concealed by more recent
                deposits, Silurian rocks appear on the surface&nbsp;only in north-western Russia
                (Esthonia, Livonia, St Petersburg,&nbsp;and on the Volkhoff), where all European
                subdivisions of tho&nbsp;system have been found, in the Timan ridge, on the western
                slope&nbsp;of the Urals, in the Pai-kho ridge, and in the islands of the
                Arctic&nbsp;Ocean. In Poland it is met with in the Kielce mountains, and

        <p><span class="font1">The Devonian dolomites, limestones, and red sandstones cover immense
                tracts and appear on the surface over a much wider area.&nbsp;From Esthonia these
                rocks extend north-east to Lake Onega, and&nbsp;south-east to Moghileff; they form
                the central plateau, as also the&nbsp;slopes of the Urals and the Petchora region.
                In north-western and&nbsp;middle Russia they contain a special fauna, and it appears
                that the&nbsp;Lower Devonian series of western Europe, represented in
                Poland&nbsp;and in the Urals, is missing in north-western and central
                Russia,&nbsp;where only the Middle and Upper Devonian divisions are
            found.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Carboniferous deposits cover nearly all eastern Russia, their west
                boundary being a line drawn from Archangel to the upper&nbsp;Dnieper, thence to the
                upper Don, and south to the mouth of the&nbsp;last-named river, with a long narrow
                gulf extending west to&nbsp;encircle the plateau of the Donetz. They are visible,
                however,&nbsp;only on the western borders of this region, being covered
                towards&nbsp;the east by thick Permian and Triassic strata. Russia has
                three&nbsp;large coal-bearing regions—the Moscow basin, the Donetz region,&nbsp;and
                the Urals. In the Valdai plateau there are only a few beds of&nbsp;mediocre coal. In
                the DIoscow basin, which was a broad gulf of the&nbsp;Carboniferous sea, coal
                appears as isolated inconstant seams amidst&nbsp;littoral deposits, the formation of
                which was favoured by frequent&nbsp;minor subsidences of the sea-coast. The Donetz
                coal-measures,&nbsp;containing abundant remains of a rich land-flora, cover
                nearly&nbsp;16,000 square miles, and comprise a valuable stock of
                excellent&nbsp;anthracite and coal, together with iron-mines. Several
                smaller&nbsp;coal-fields on the slopes of the Urals and on the Timan ridge
                may&nbsp;be added to the above. The Polish coal-fields belong to
                another&nbsp;Carboniferous area of deposit, which extended over Silesia.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The Permian limestones and marls occupy a strip in eastern Russia of
                much less extent than that assigned to them on geological&nbsp;maps a few years ago.
                The variegated marls of eastern Russia,&nbsp;rich in salt-springs, but very poor in
                fossils, are now held by most&nbsp;Russian geologists to be Triassic. Indisputably
                Triassic deposits&nbsp;have been found only in the two Bogdo mountains in the
                Kirghiz&nbsp;Steppe </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >[Campilcr-Sefiichtcn)</span><span class="font1"> and in south-western
                Poland.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">During the Jurassic period the sea began again to invade Russia from
                south-east and north-west. The limits of the Russian Jurassic&nbsp;system may be
                represented by a line drawn from the double valley&nbsp;of the Sukhona and Vytchegda
                to that of the upper Volga, and&nbsp;thence to Kiefl', with a wide gulf penetrating
                towards the northwest. Within this space three depressions, all running
                south-west&nbsp;to north-east, are filled up with Upper Jurassic deposits.
                They&nbsp;are much denuded in the higher parts of this region, and appear&nbsp;but
                as isolated islands in central Russia. In the south-east all&nbsp;the older
                subdivisions arc represented, the deposits having the&nbsp;characters of a deep-sea
                deposit in the Aral-Caspian region and on&nbsp;the Caucasus.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The Cretaceous deposits—sands, loose sandstones, marls, and white
                chalk—cover the region south of a line drawn from the&nbsp;Niemen to the upper Oka
                and Don, and thence north-east to&nbsp;Simbirsk, with the exception of the Dnieper
                and Don ridge, the&nbsp;Yaita Dlountains, and the upper Caucasus. They are rich in
                grinding stone, and especially in secondary layers of phosphorites.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The Tertiary formations occupy large areas in southern Russia. The
                Eoccne covers wide tracts from Lithuania to Tsaritsyn, and is&nbsp;represented in
                the Crimea and Caucasus by thick deposits belonging to the same ocean, which left
                its deposits on the Alps and the&nbsp;Himalayas. Oligocene, quite similar to that of
                North Germany,&nbsp;and containing brown coal and amber, has been met with only
                in&nbsp;Poland, Courland, and Lithuania. The Miocene (Sarmatian&nbsp;stage) occupies
                extensive tracts in southern Russia, south of a&nbsp;line drawn through Lublin to
                Ekaterinoslaff and Saratoff Not&nbsp;only the higher chains of Caucasus and Yaita,
                but also the Donetz&nbsp;ridge, rose above the level of the DIiocene sea, which was
                very&nbsp;shallow to the north of this last ridge, while farther south it
                was&nbsp;connected both with the Vienna basin and with the Aral-Caspian.&nbsp;The
                Pliocene appears only in the coast region of the Black and&nbsp;Azoff Seas, but it
                is widely developed in the Aral-Caspian region,&nbsp;where, however, the Ust-Urt and
                the Obshchiy Syrt rose above the&nbsp;sea.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The thick Quateniary, or Post-Pliocene, deposits which cover nearly
                all Russia were for a long time a puzzle to geologists. They&nbsp;consist of a
                boulder clay in the north and of loess in the south.&nbsp;The former presents an
                intimate mixture of boulders brought from&nbsp;Finland and Olonetz (with an addition
                of local boulders) with small&nbsp;gravel, coarse sand, and the finest glacial
                mud,—the whole bearing&nbsp;no trace of ever having been washed up and sorted by
                water in&nbsp;motion, except in subordinate layers of glacial sand and gravel
                ;&nbsp;the size of the boulders decreases on the whole from north to south,&nbsp;and
                tho boulder clay, especially in northern and central Russia,&nbsp;often takes the
