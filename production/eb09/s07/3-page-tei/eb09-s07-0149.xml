The writings of the Syrian heathens, such as the so-called Sābians (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Sabians)</hi> of Harrān, which were extant, at least in part, even in the 13th century,@@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> seem to have now wholly disappeared. The beginnings of this literature are lost in the darkness of the earliest ages of Christianity. It was at its best from the 4th to the 8th century, and then gradually died away, though it kept up a flickering existence till the 14th century or even later. We must own —and it is well to make the confession at the outset— that the literature of Syria is, on the whole, not an attractive one. As Renan said long ago,@@<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> the characteristic of the Syrians is a certain mediocrity. They shone neither in war, nor in the arts, nor in science. They altogether lacked the poetic fire of the older—we purposely emphasize the word—the older Hebrews and of the Arabs. But they were apt enough as pupils of the Greeks ; they assimilated and reproduced, adding little or nothing of their own. There was no Al-Fārābī, no Ibn Sīnā, no Ibn Rushd, in the cloisters of Edessa, Ken-neshrē, or Nisibis. Yet to the Syrians belongs the merit of having passed on the lore of ancient Greece to the Arabs, and therefore, as a matter of history, their literature must always possess a certain amount of interest in the eyes of the modern student. The Syrian Church never produced men who rose to the level of a Eusebius, a Gregory Nazianzen, a Basil, and a Chrysostom ; but we may still be thankful to the plodding diligence which has preserved for us in fairly good translations many valuable works of Greek fathers which would otherwise have been lost. And even Syria’s humble chroniclers, such as John of Ephesus, Dionysius of Tell-Mahrē, and Bar-Hebræus, deserve their meed of praise, seeing that, without their guidance, we should have known far less than we now know about the history of two important branches of the Eastern Church, besides losing much interesting information as to the political events of the periods with which their annals are occupied.</p><p>As Syriac literature commences with the Bible, we first briefly enumerate the different versions of Holy Scripture.</p><p>The most important of these is the so-called Pĕshīttā <hi rend="italic">(mappaktā  pĕshīttā),</hi> “the simple” or “plain version," the Syriac vulgate. This name is in use as early as the 9th or 10th century.@@<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> As to the Old Testament, neither the exact time nor place of its translation is known ; indeed, from certain differences of style and manner in its several parts, we may rather suppose it to be the work of different hands, extending over a considerable period of time. It would seem, however, as a whole, to have been a product of the 2d century, and not improbably a monument of the learning and zeal of the Christians of Edessa. Possibly Jewish converts, or even Jews, took a part in it, for some books (such as the Pentateuch and Job) are very literally rendered, whereas the coincidences with the LXX. (which are particularly numerous in the prophetical books) show the hand of Christian translators or revisers. That Jews should have had at any rate a consultative share in this work need not surprise us, when we remember that Syrian fathers, such as Aphraates, in the middle of the 4th century, and Jacob of Edessa, in the latter half of the 7th, had frequent recourse, like Jerome, to the scholars of the synagogue. To what extent subsequent revision may have been carried it is not easy to say ; but it seems tolerably certain that alterations were made from time to time with a view to harmonizing the Syriac text with that of the LXX. Such an opportunity may, for instance, have been afforded on a considerable scale by the adoption of Lucian’s text of the LXX. at Antioch in the beginning of the 4th century (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Septuagint,</hi> vol. xxi. p. 669). On all these points, however, we know nothing for</p><p>certain, and may well repeat the words of Theodore of Mopsuestia in his commentary on Zephaniah i. 6@@<hi rend="superscript">4</hi>: <hi rend="italic">ηρμηveυτaι Sè ταΰτα</hi> eis <hi rend="italic">μev την Σύρων παρ’ 0τoυ δή πoτe' ουδέ yàp tyvωστaι μjlχpi τηs τi∣μepov oστιs πoτl ovros iστιv.</hi></p><p>The canonical books of the Old Testament according to the Pĕshīttā are substantially those of the Hebrew Bible. In the' Massoretic MSS. (see below), whether Nestorian or Jacobite, the books of Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah are passed over, and in the Nestorian the book of Esther also. But, on the other hand, it must be noticed that all these books are cited by Aphraates, and that they all appear in the <hi rend="italic">Codex Ambrosianus.</hi> Of the Chronicles there is a MS. of the 6th century in the British Museum, Add. 17104. Esther appears in a volume of equal age (Add. 14652) as one of the constituent parts of the “Book of Women,” the others being Ruth, Susanna, Judith, and the history of Thecla, the disciple of St Paul, which last is excluded from Biblical MSS. The oldest dated MS. of any portion of the Old Testament at present known to us is Add. 14425 in the British Museum (Gen., Exod., Num., Deut.), transcribed at Āmid by a deacon named John in 464. The deutero-canonical books or apocrypha, translated by different hands from the Greek,@@<hi rend="superscript">5</hi> are nearly the same as in the LXX.@@<hi rend="superscript">6 </hi>The <hi rend="italic">Codex Ambrosianus,@@</hi><hi rend="superscript">7</hi> for example, contains Wisdom, the Epistle of Jeremiah, and two Epistles of Baruch ; the Song of the Three Children, Bel and the Dragon, and Susanna ; Judith, Siracides or Ecclesiasticus ; the Apocalypse of Baruch ; the fourth book of Esdras ; and five books of the Maccabees, the fourth being the history of Samona and her sons, and the fifth <hi rend="italic">Josephi de Bello Judaico lib. vi</hi>.@@<hi rend="superscript">8</hi> To these must be added from other MSS. the first or third book of Esdras, the book of Tobit, and the prayer of Manasses. Of the first book of the Maccabees two recensions are extant, as far as chap. xiv. 24. The book of Tobit presents the text of the LXX. as far as chap. vii. 11.@@<hi rend="superscript">9</hi></p><p>The canonical books of the New Testament are the four Gospels, the Acts of the Apostles (to which are annexed the three catholic epistles, viz., James, 1 Peter, and 1 John), and the fourteen epistles of St Paul. The shorter apostolic epistles, viz., 2 and 3 John, 2 Peter, and Jude, and the Apocalypse of St John, were rejected by the early Syrian Church.@@<hi rend="superscript">10</hi></p><p>As to the Pĕshīttā version of the Gospels (P), a variety of critical questions arise when we consider it in connexion with two other works, the <hi rend="italic">Dia-tessarδn</hi> of Tatian (T) and the <hi rend="italic">Curetonian Gospels </hi>(Sc).@@<hi rend="superscript">11</hi> Tatian, the friend of Justin Martyr, afterwards counted a heretic, composed out of the four Gospels a work which received the title of Τό <hi rend="italic">δt,a τεσσάρων eυayyl∖ιοv,</hi> in Syriac more briefly <hi rend="italic">Dia-lcssaron,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Evangelion da-Mĕḥallĕṭē,</hi> “the Gospel of the Mixed.” It is a subject of controversy whether Tatian wrote this work in Greek or in Syriac, and whether he compiled it from the Greek Gospels or from a previous Syriac version. According to Zahn@@<hi rend="superscript">12</hi> and Baethgen,@@<hi rend="superscript">13</hi> the author’s language was Syriac, his sources Greek.
