              <p>               <label><hi rend="smallcaps"> Book of</hi> RUTH</label>, a canonical book of the
                    Old Te-ſtament ; being a kind of appendix to the book of Judges, and an
                    introduction to thoſe σf Samuel; and having its title from the perſon whoſe
                    ſtory is here principally related. In this ſtory are obſervable the ancient
                    rights of kindred and redemption ; and the manner of buying the inheritance of
                    the deceaſed, with other particulars of great note and antiquity. The
                    ca-nonicalneſs of this book was never diſputed ; but the learned are not agreed
                    about the epocha of the hiſtory it relates. Ruth the Moabiteſs is found in the
                    genealogy of our Saviour. Matth, i. 5.</p>            </div>
