Besides these establishments, all the religious denominations have week-day and Sunday schools in different parts of the town. A literary and philosophical society was instituted in 1822 ; they have a museum in the music-hall, containing handsome cabinets of fossils, minerals, objects of natural history, apparatus, &amp;c. and a capital full-length portrait of the poet Montgomery, who has long been regarded as one of the chief ornaments of the town.</p><p>There is a large theatre, erected in 1762 ; and under the same roof a commodious assembly-room ; and adjacent, the music-hall, in which concerts and public lectures are usually delivered. A short distance outside the town, on the west, are the botanical gardens, comprising a well-enclosed plot of eighteen acres of ground, laid out in a style of elegance, and commanding an extensive prospect. The glazed conservatories present a frontage of 300 feet. On the opposite slope is a beautiful cemetery.</p><p>The general infirmary, which was opened in 1797 for “ the sick and lame poor of any nation,” is a large and handsome edifice, on the north-west side of the town. A subscription of L.5000 has just been raised for the purpose of adding a fever-hospital to this noble institution. Sheffield has also a medical and anatomical school, a public dispensary, and a capital bath establishment. On a fine eminence, just outside the town, stands the Shrewsbury Hospital, a charity founded in 1673, and consisting of neat houses for eighteen men and eighteen women, the former receiving ten and the latter eight shillings a week, besides coals, coats, &amp;c. Holliss’s Hospital, in the town, contains sixteen houses for poor cotters’ widows, who have each seven shillings a week. There are various other smaller charities.</p><p>From the earliest period of authentic history, the Lovetots, Furnivals, Talbots, and Howards, names of stirring interest in English annals, were successively chiefs of Hal- lamshire, the present Duke of Norfolk being lord of the manor of Sheffield. With the transactions of these illustrious families, the older records of their ample domain and its industrious inhabitants are so intimately mixed up, that it is hardly possible to give any history of the one without involving details concerning the other. One circumstance especially has given a universality of interest to this association, namely, the committal of the unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots to the custody of George the sixth earl of Shrewsbury, and the fact that she spent the greater part of fourteen years of her troubled life at Sheffield. The residence of the royal prisoner here was chiefly at the castle, a place of strength, formerly standing at the confluence of the rivers Sheaf and Don, at the northern angle of the town, but which was so utterly demolished after the civil wars, that its situation is at present only indicated by the historian, or by the ineffaceable names of adjacent localities. The Talbots had likewise a summer residence, called the “ Manour,” built on a fine eminence in the ancient “ Lark,” a mile east of the town : of this residence a shattered and far-conspicuous fragment remains. And here, too, the ill- fated Mary occasionally resided during her captivity ; and the spot is often visited by curious or sympathizing individuals on that account. An enthusiastic admirer and apologist of Mary, Samuel Roberts, Esq. has recently erected, at an expense of several thousand pounds, and in a beautiful situation, in Sheffield Lark, a small castlc, of the most exquisite architecture, which he calls “ Queen’s Tower.”</p><p>The inhabitants of Sheffield are indebted for an elegant and most elaborate history of the ancient and modern state of their town and neighbourhood, to the Reverend Joseph Hunter, a native of the place, who, in 1819, published his “ Hallamshire," in one volume folio.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sheffield, </hi><hi rend="italic">John,</hi> Duke of Buckinghamshire, an eminent writer of the seventeenth and eighteenth century, of great personal bravery, and an able minister of state, was born</p><p>about 1650. He lost his father at nine years of age ; and his mother having married Lord Ossulston, the care of his education was left entirely to a governor, who did not greatly improve him in his studies. Finding that he was deficient in many parts of literature, he resolved to devote a certain number of hours every day to his studies ; and thereby improved himself to the degree of learning which he afterwards attained. Though possessed of a good estate, he did not abandon himself to pleasure and indolence, but entered as a volunteer in the second Dutch war, and was in that famous naval engagement where the Duke of York commanded as admiral ; upon which occasion his lordship behaved so gallantly, that he was appointed commander of the Royal Catharine. He afterwards made a campaign in the French service under M. de Turenne. As Tangier was in danger of being taken by the Moors, he offered to head the forces which were sent to defend it, and accordingly was appointed to command them. He was then Earl of Mul- grave, and one of the lords of the bed-chamber to Charles II. The Moors retired on the approach of his majesty’s forces ; and the result of the expedition was the blowing up of Tangier. He continued in several great posts during the short reign of James II. till that unfortunate prince was dethroned. Lord Mulgrave, though he paid his respects to King William before he was advanced to the throne, yet did not accept of any post in the government until some years afterwards. In the sixth year of William and Mary he was created Marquis of Normanby in the county of Lincoln. He was one of the most active and zealous opponents of the bill which took away Sir John Fenwick’s life ; and exerted the utmost vigour in carrying through the Treason Bill, and the bill for Triennial Parliaments. He enjoyed some considerable posts under King William, and possessed much of his favour and confidence. In 1702 he was sworn lord privy-seal ; and in the same year was appointed one of the commissioners to treat of an union between England and Scotland. In 1703 he was created Duke of Normanby, and soon after Duke of Buckinghamshire. In 1711 he was made steward of her majesty’s household, and president of the council. During Queen Anne’s reign he was but once out of employment ; and then he voluntarily resigned, being attached to what were called the Tory Principles. Her majesty offered to make him lord chancellor, but he declined the office. He was instrumental in the change of the ministry in 1710. A circumstance that reflects the highest honour on him, is the vigour with which he acted in favour of the unhappy Catalans, who were afterwards so inhumanly sacrificed. He was survived by only one legitimate son, who died at Rome in 1735 ; but he left several natural children. He died in 1721. He was admired by the poets of his age ; by Dryden, Prior, and Garth. His Essay on Poetry was applauded by Addison, and his Rehearsal is still read with pleasure. His writings were splendidly printed in 1723, in two volumes 4to, and have since been reprinted in 1729, in two volumes 8vo. The first contains his poems on various subjects ; the second, his prose works, consisting of historical memoirs, speeches in parliament, characters, dialogues, critical observations, essays, and letters. It may be proper to observe, that the edition of 1729 is castrated; some particulars relating to the revolution having given offence.</p><p>SHEICK, in the oriental customs, the person who has the care of the mosques in Egypt : his duty is the same as that of the imams at Constantinople. There are more or fewer of these to every mosque, according to its size or revenue. One of them is head over the rest, and answers to a parish priest with us, and has under him, in large mosques, the readers, and people who cry out to go to prayers ; but in small mosques the sheick is obliged to do all this himself. In such it is their business to open the mosque, to cry to prayers, and to begin their short devotions at the head of</p></body></text></TEI>
