Even on this inner side it was defended by a wall, the&nbsp;gates in which are called “ Capitolii fores ” by Tacitus. Part of the&nbsp;outer wall at the top of the tufa rock, which is cut into a smooth&nbsp;cliff, is visible from the modern Vicolo della Rupe Tarpeia;&nbsp;this cliff is traditionally called the Tarpcian rock, but that must&nbsp;have been on the other side towards the Forum, from whence it&nbsp;was visible, as is clearly stated by Dionysius (vii. 35, viii. 78).<sup>@@3</sup>&nbsp;Another piece of the ancient wall has been exposed, about&nbsp;half-way up the slope from the Forum to the Arx. It is built&nbsp;of soft yellow tufa blocks, five courses of which still remain&nbsp;in the existing fragment. The large temple of Juno Moneta&nbsp;(“ the Adviser ”) on the Arx, built by Camillus in 384 B.c.,&nbsp;was used as the mint; hence </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">moneta— “</span><span class="font2"> money ” (Liv. vi. 20).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A large number of other temples and smaller shrines stood on the Capitoline hill,&quot;a word used broadly to include both the Capitolium&nbsp;and the Arx.<sup>@@4 </sup>Among these were the temple of Honos and Virtus,&nbsp;built by Marius,-and the temple of Fides, founded by Numa, and&nbsp;rebuilt during the First Punic war. Both these were large enough&nbsp;to hold meetings of the senate. The temples of Mars Ultor </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Mon.&nbsp;Anc.</span><span class="font2"> 4, 5) and Jupiter Tonans (Suet. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aug.</span><span class="font2"> 29; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mon.

Other shrines existed to Venus Victrix&nbsp;Ops, Jupiter Custos, and Concord—the last under the Arx (Liv.&nbsp;xxii. 33)—and many others, as well as a triumphal arch in honour&nbsp;of Nero, and a crowd of statues and other works of art (see Plin.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">H.N.</span><span class="font2"> xxxiii. 9, xxxiv. 38, 39, 40, 43, 44, 79, xxxv. 69, 100, 108,&nbsp;157), so that the whole hill must have been a mass of architectural&nbsp;and artistic magnificence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The so-called Tabularium<sup>@@5</sup> occupies the central part, of the side towards the Forum; it is set on the tufa rock, which is cut away&nbsp;to receive its lower storey.

The columns&nbsp;appear to have belonged to the 1st century </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font2"> A road paved&nbsp;with basalt passes through the building along this arcade, entered&nbsp;at one end from the Clivus Capitolinus, and at. the other probably&nbsp;from the Gradus Monetae, a flight of steps leading from the temple&nbsp;of Concord and the Forum up to the temple of Juno Moneta on the&nbsp;Arx. The entrance from the Clivus Capitolinus is by a wide flat&nbsp;arch of peperino beautifully jointed; the other end wall has been&nbsp;mostly destroyed.

From this higher level a long steep staircase of sixty-seven steps descends towards the&nbsp;Forum; tne doorway at the foot of these stairs has a flat arch,&nbsp;with a circular relieving arch over it; it was blocked up by the&nbsp;temple of Vespasian. Great damage was done to this building&nbsp;by the additions of Boniface VIII. and Nicholas V., as well as&nbsp;by its being used as a salt store, by which the walls were much&nbsp;corroded.<sup>@@6</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The Forum Julium (see fig. 11, Plan), with its central temple of Venus Genetrix, was begun, about ,5a </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.,</span><span class="font2"> by Julius (who dedicated&nbsp;it in an unfinished state in 46 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.)</span><span class="font2"> and completed by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">p<sub>orum</sub></span></p>

The arches are&nbsp;slightly cambered with travertine springers and keys; the rest,&nbsp;with the circular relieving arch over, is.of tufa; it was once lined&nbsp;with slabs of marble, the holes for which exist. Foundations of&nbsp;the circuit wall exist under the houses towards S. Adriano, but the&nbsp;whole plan has not been made out. In the centre of the Forum&nbsp;stood, the temple of Venus Genetrix, whose remains were seen and&nbsp;described by Palladio </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Arch.</span><span class="font2"> iv. 31).

<p><span class="font2">The forum of Augustus (see fig. 11) adjoined that of Julius on its north-east side; it contained the temple of Mars Ultor. built to&nbsp;commemorate the vengeance taken on Caesar’s murderers&nbsp;at Philippi, 42 B.c. (Ov. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fast.</span><span class="font2"> v. 575 seq.).<sup>@@10</sup> It was&nbsp;surrounded with a massive wall of peperino, over 100 ft.&nbsp;high, with travertine string-courses and cornice; a large piece of&nbsp;this wall still exists, and is one of the most imposing relics ofancient&nbsp;Rome. Against it are remains of the temple of Mars, three columns&nbsp;of which, with their entablature and marble ceiling </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font2">the peristyle,&nbsp;are still standing; it is Corinthian in style, very richly decorated,&nbsp;and built of fine Luna marble. The cella is of peperino, lined with&nbsp;marble; and the lower part of the lofty circuit wall seems also to&nbsp;have been lined with marble on the inside of the forum. The large&nbsp;archway by the temple (Arco dei Pantani) is of travertine. Palladio&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Arch,</span><span class="font2"> iv.) and other writers of the 16th century give plans of the&nbsp;temple and circuit wall, showing much more than now exists. The&nbsp;temple, which was octastyle, with nine columns and a pilaster on the&nbsp;sides, occupied the centre, and on each side the circuit wall formed&nbsp;two large semicircular apses, decorated with tiers of niches for&nbsp;statues.<sup>@@11</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Forum Pacis, built by Vespasian, was farther to the southeast; the only existing piece, a massive and lofty wall of mixed tufa and peperino, with a travertine archway, is opposite&nbsp;the end of the basilica of Constantine. The arch opened&nbsp;into the so-called Templum Sacrae Urbis, a rectangular&nbsp;building entered by a portico on its west side, whose north wall was&nbsp;decorated with a marble plan of the city of Rome (see below, p. 608).&nbsp;The original plan was probably burnt with the whole group of&nbsp;buildings in this forum in 19T, in the reign of Commodus (Dio Cass,&nbsp;lxxii. 24); but a new plan was made, and the building restored in&nbsp;concrete and brick by Severus. The north end wall, with the clamps&nbsp;for fixing the marble plan, still exists, as does also the other (restored)&nbsp;end wall with its arched windows towards the forum; one hundred&nbsp;and sixty-seven fragments of this plan were found </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font2"> 1563 at the&nbsp;foot of the wall to which they were fixed, and are now preserved in&nbsp;the Capitoline Museum; drawings of seventy-four pieces now lost&nbsp;are preserved in the Vatican<sup>@@12</sup> </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Cod.

Other fragments have since been brought to&nbsp;light, and the whole series was rearranged in the Palazzo dei&nbsp;Conservatori in 1903. The circular building at the end facing&nbsp;on the Sacra Via is an addition built by Maxentius in honour&nbsp;of his deified son Romulus; like the other buildings of Maxentius, it was rededicated and inscribed with the name of his conqueror</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
