 (1549-1622), a learned Englishman, was the second son of Henry Savile, and was born at Over Bradley, near Halifax, Yorkshire, 30th November 1549. He entered Brasenose College, Oxford, whence he was elected to Merton College in 1561, where he took his degree in Arts and was chosen fellow. After graduating M.A. in 1570, he voluntarily read lectures on mathematics in the university. He was proctor in 1575 and 1576, travelled on the Continent collecting MSS. in 1578, and on his return was tutor to Elizabeth in Greek and mathematics. He was warden of Merton College from 1585 until his death, and in 1596 was chosen provost of Eton College. He was offered preferment by James I. after his accession in 1604, but would accept nothing more than the honour of knighthood. After the death of his son Henry he devoted his fortune to the promotion of learning. In 1619 he founded lectures on mathematics and astronomy at Oxford, and he also made various other benefactions to the university, including the foundation of a mathematical library for the professors, and the gift of several rare MSS. and printed books to the Bodleian. He died at Eton College 19th February 1622, and was buried in the chapel there. In recognition of his great services to the university, a public speech and verses were made in his praise, which were soon afterwards published under the title <hi rend="italic">Ultima Linea Savilii.</hi></p><p>Savile was held in the highest esteem by all the learned of his time. He published <hi rend="italic">Four Books of the Histories of Cornelius Tacitus, and the Life of Agricola, with Notes,</hi> dedicated to Queen Elizabeth (1581) ; <hi rend="italic">A View of Certain Military Matters, or Commentaries concerning Roman Warfare</hi> (1598) ; <hi rend="italic">Rerum Anglicarum Scriptores post Bedam</hi> (1596) ; an excellent edition of Chrysostom, 8 vols.
