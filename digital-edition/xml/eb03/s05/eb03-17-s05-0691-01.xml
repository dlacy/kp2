 in botany : A genus of plants belonging to the claſs of <hi rend="italic">pentandria,</hi> and order of <hi rend="italic">mοnogynia ;</hi> and in the natural ſyſtem arranged under the 47th order, <hi rend="italic">Stellata.</hi> The corolla is funnel-ſhayed ; the capſule is didymous, bilocular, and polyſpermous. There are two ſpecies, the anthelmia and marilandica.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">anthelmia</hi> has a herbaceous ſtem, and its higheſt leaves are fourfold.</p><p>“ The effects of this medicine (lays Dr Browne) are theſe: It firſt procures ſleep, almoſt as certainly, and in an equal degree, with opium; the eyes ſeem to be diſtended, and ſparkle as it were before the eruption of the ſmall-pox or meaſles, which may be eaſily obſerved after the ſleep is over ; the pulſe grows regular and riſes, the fever cools, the ſymptoms appear more favourable, and the worms are generally diſcharged by the uſe of the ſubſequent purgatives (if not before) in great quantities, often above 100 at a time ; but when a few only come away, which is ſeldom, and theſe alive, the same doſes are again repeated, which ſeldom or never fail. I never ſaw this medicine fail when there was the leaſt probability of succeſs ; nay, often prove ſucceſsful when there was not the leaſt reaſon to expect it. I have been, however, cautious in ordering it for children ; for though I never knew it at all hurtful, its effect upon the eyes has often deterred me from ordering it to children, whoſe fibres are weak and relaxed, and in whom the fevers from this source are ſeldom ſo vehement as to hinder the adminiſtration of other medicines, likely as effectual in other caſes of this nature. This plant is generally had in low dry lands, after they have been turned up ſome months, and after great rains ; its taſte is herbaceous, and ſomewhat clammy, its growth is ſoft and hidden, its ſtalk hollow, ſmooth, and roundiſh. Its herbaceous taſte and ſudden growth would alone make me think it capable of little or no action, had not hundreds of careful observations ſatisfied me to the contrary.”</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">marilandica,</hi> perennial worm-graſs, or Indian pink. The beſt deſcription of this plant which we have seen is given by Dr Woodville, in his Medical Botany ; a work which exhibits a complete ſyſtematic view of the medicinal effects of vegetables. Its ſtem is four- cornered ; all the leaves oppoſite.</p><p>Dr Garden, in a letter to the late Dr Hope, profeſs ſor of botany in the univerſity of Edinburgh, dated 1763, gives the following account of the virtues of this plant. “ About 40 years ago, the anthelmintic virtues of the root of this plant were diſcovered by the Indians ; since which time it has been much uſed here by phyſicians, practitioners, and planters ; yet its true doſe is not generally aſcertained. I have given it in hundreds of cases, and have been very attentive to its effects. I never found it do much ſervice, except when it proved gently purgative. Its purgative quality naturally led me to give it in febrile diſeaſes, which ſeemed to ariſe from viſcidity in the <hi rend="italic">prima via ;</hi> and, in theſe caſes, it ſucceeded to admiration, even when the ſick did not void worms.</p><p>“ I have of late, previous to the uſe of the Indian pink, given a vomit, wſhen the circumſtances of the case permitted it ; and I have found this method anſwer ſo well, that I think a vomit ſhould never be omitted. I have known half a dram of this root purge as briſkly as the ſame quantity of rhubarb ; at other times I have known it, though given in large quantities, produce no effect upon the belly : in ſuch caſes, it becomes neceſſary to add a grain or two of ſweet mercury, or ſome grains of rhubarb ; but it is to be obſerved, that the same happy effects did not follow its uſe in this way, as when it was purgative without addition. The addition, however, of the purgative renders its uſe ſafe, and removes all danger of convulsions of the eyes, although neither <hi rend="italic">ol, rutae, ſabinae,</hi> or any other nervous ſubſtance, is given along with it. It is, in general, ſafer to give it in large doſes than in ſmall ; for, from the latter, more frequently the giddineſs, dimneſs of the fight, and convoitions, &amp;c. follow ; whereas, from large doſes, I have not known any other effect than its proving emetic or violently cathartic. To a child of two years of age, who had been taking 10 grains of the root twice a-day, without having any other effect than making her dull and giddy, I preſcribed 22 grains morning and evening, which purged her briſkly, and brought away five large worms. After ſome months an increaſed doſe had the ſame good effects. I prefer the root to the other parts of the plant; of which, when properly dried, I gave from 12 to 60 or 70 grains in ſubſtance. In infusion, it may be given to the quantity of two, three, or four drams, twice a-day. I have found that, by keeping, the plant loses its virtue in part ; for 40 grains of the root which has not been gathered above two months, will operate as ſtrongly as 60 which has been kept for 15 months.”</p><p>In Dr Garden’s ſubſequent letters, addreſſed to Dr Hope, in the years 1764 and 1766, the efficacy of this root in worm cases is further confirmed; and he obſerves, that the root keeps better than he at firſt thought (having lately uſed it ſeveral years old with great ſucceſs). In what he calls continued or remitting low worm fevers, he found its efficacy promoted by the addition of <hi rend="italic">rad. ſepentar virg.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
