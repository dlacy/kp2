<p><span class="font0">ROUSSEAU, PIERRE ÉTIENNE THÉODORE (1812-1867), French painter of the Barbizon school, was born in Paris on the&nbsp;15th of April 1812, of a bourgeois family which included one or&nbsp;two artists. At first he received a business training, but soon&nbsp;displayed aptitude for painting. Although his father regretted&nbsp;the decision at first, he became reconciled to his son [leaving&nbsp;business, and throughout the artist’s career (for he survived&nbsp;his son) was a sympathizer with him in all his conflicts with&nbsp;the Salon authorities. Théodore Rousseau shared the difficulties&nbsp;of the romantic painters of 1830 in securing for their pictures&nbsp;a place in the annual Paris exhibition. The whole influence&nbsp;of the classically trained artists was against them, and not&nbsp;until 1848 was Rousseau adequately presented to the public.&nbsp;He had exhibited one or two unimportant works in the Salon&nbsp;of 1831 and 1834, but in 1836 his great work “ La Déscente des&nbsp;vaches ” was rejected by the vote of the classic painters; and&nbsp;from then until after the revolution of 1848 he was persistently&nbsp;refused. He was not without champions in the press, and&nbsp;under the title of “le grand refusé ” he became known through&nbsp;the writings of Thoré, the critic who afterwards resided in&nbsp;England and wrote under the name of Bürger. During these&nbsp;years of artistic exile Rousseau produced some of his finest&nbsp;pictures: “ The Chestnut Avenue,” “ The Marsh in the&nbsp;Landes ” (now in the Louvre), “ Hoar-Frost ” (now in America);&nbsp;and in 1851, after the reorganization of the Salon in 1848, he&nbsp;exhibited his masterpiece, “ The Edge of the Forest ” (also in&nbsp;the Louvre), a picture similar in treatment to, but slightly&nbsp;varied in subject from, the composition called “ A Glade in&nbsp;the Forest of Fontainebleau,” in the Wallace collection at&nbsp;Hertford House.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Up to this period Rousseau had lived only occasionally at Barbizon, but in 1848 he took up his residence in the forest&nbsp;village, and spent most of his remaining days in the vicinity.&nbsp;He was now at the height of his artistic power, and was able&nbsp;to obtain fair sums for his pictures (but only about one-tenth&nbsp;of their value thirty years after his death), and his circle of&nbsp;admirers increased. He was still ignored by the authorities,&nbsp;for while Diaz was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour&nbsp;in 1851, Rousseau was left undecorated at this time, but was&nbsp;nominated shortly afterwards. At the Exposition Universelle&nbsp;of 1855, where all Rousseau’s rejected pictures of the previous&nbsp;twenty years were gathered together, his works were acknowledged to form one of the finest of the many splendid groups&nbsp;there exhibited. But during his lifetime Rousseau never really&nbsp;conquered French taste, and after an unsuccessful sale of&nbsp;his works by auction in 1861, he contemplated leaving Paris&nbsp;for Amsterdam or London, or even New York. Misfortune&nbsp;then overtook him : his wife, who had been a source of constant&nbsp;anxiety for years, became almost hopelessly insane; his aged&nbsp;father looked constantly to him for pecuniary assistance;&nbsp;his patrons were few. Moreoever, while he was temporarily&nbsp;absent with his invalid wife, a youth living in his home (a&nbsp;friend of his family) committed suicide in his Barbizon cottage;&nbsp;when he visited the Alps in 1863, making sketches of Mont&nbsp;Blanc, he fell dangerously ill with inflammation of the lungs;&nbsp;and when he returned to Barbizon he suffered from insomnia&nbsp;and became gradually <sub>t</sub> weakened. He was elected president&nbsp;of the fine art jury for the 1867 Exposition. His disappointment at being passed over in the distribution of the higher&nbsp;awards told seriously on his health, and in August he was&nbsp;seized with paralysis. He slightly recovered, but was again&nbsp;attacked several times during the autumn. Finally, in&nbsp;November, he began to sink, and he died, in the presence of&nbsp;his lifelong friend, J. F. Millet, on the 22nd of December 1867.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rousseau’s other friend and neighbour, Jules Dupré, himself an eminent landscape painter of Barbizon, relates the difficulty&nbsp;Rousseau experienced in knowing when his picture was finished,&nbsp;and how he, Dupré, would sometimes take away from the&nbsp;studio some canvas on which Rousseau was labouring too&nbsp;long. Millet, the peasant painter, for whom Rousseau had&nbsp;the highest regard, was much with him during the last years&nbsp;of his life, and at his death Millet took charge of the insane&nbsp;wife. Rousseau was a good friend to Diaz, teaching him&nbsp;how to paint trees, for up to a certain point in his career Diaz&nbsp;considered he could only paint figures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rousseau’s pictures are always grave in character, with an air of exquisite melancholy which is powerfully attractive&nbsp;to the lover of landscapes. They are well finished when they&nbsp;profess to be completed pictures, but Rousseau spent so long&nbsp;a time in working up his subjects that his absolutely completed&nbsp;works are comparatively few. He left many canvases with&nbsp;parts of the picture realized in detail and with the remainder&nbsp;somewhat vague; and also a good number of sketches and&nbsp;water-colour drawings. His pen work in monochrome on&nbsp;paper is rare; it is particularly searching in quality. There&nbsp;are a number of fine pictures by him in the Louvre, and the&nbsp;Wallace collection contains one of his most imf&gt;ortant Barbizon&nbsp;pictures. There is also an example in the Ionides collection&nbsp;at the Victoria and Albert Museum.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROUSSEAU DE LA ROTTIÈRE, JEAN SIMÉON (b. 1747), French decorative painter, was the youngest son of Jules&nbsp;Antoine Rousseau, “sculpteur du Roi.” The territorial addition&nbsp;to his patronymic has never been explained, but it is known&nbsp;to have been in use when he was little more than a boy. He&nbsp;studied at the Académie Royale, where we find him in September&nbsp;1768 winning the medal given to the best painter of the quarter.&nbsp;He appears with his brother Jules Hugues to have been employed from an early date by his father for the decorative work&nbsp;executed by the family at Versailles. There has been some&nbsp;controversy among the authorities as to the respective shares&nbsp;of father and son in these works, but many of the attributions&nbsp;are fairly determined by dates, Jules Antoine Rousseau having&nbsp;been at work at Versailles for years before the birth of his&nbsp;famous son. The “ Bains du Roi,” the “ Salon de la Méridienne,” part of the bedchamber of Madame Adelaide, and the&nbsp;“ Garde-robe of Louis XVI.” were among the achievements&nbsp;which there can be little doubt were shared in by Rousseau de la&nbsp;Rottière. His most individual and most famous undertaking&nbsp;was, however, the decoration of the lovely “ Boudoir de Madame&nbsp;de Sévilly,” now at the Victoria and Albert Museum. This&nbsp;little room, 14 ft. long, 10J ft. wide and 16 ft. high, was&nbsp;removed from the house in the Rue de Saint Louis, in the&nbsp;Marais. The Seigneur de Sévilly, who was hereditary “ Trésorier-général de l’Extraordinaire des guerres” under Louis XVI.,&nbsp;married his cousin Anne Marie Louise de Pange, a favourite&nbsp;maid-of-honour of Marie Antoinette, and the story runs that&nbsp;his w’ife and the queen, desiring to give him a surprise, had&nbsp;the room decorated during his absence from Paris. It was&nbsp;purchased for the museum for 60,000 francs in 1869. The&nbsp;wall paintings of this sumptuous room came from the hand of&nbsp;Rousseau de la Rottière; the overdoor and part of the ceiling&nbsp;were executed by Lagrenée le jeune; the architect was Ledoux;&nbsp;the grey marble figures of aged men on either side of the fireplace were sculptured by Clodion; the mounts of the chimney-piece are apparently from the chisel of Gouthière. The date&nbsp;of the room is assigned to 1781-82, and Jean Siméon’s authorship&nbsp;of much of its decoration is rendered certain by his own still&nbsp;existing sketch. The decoration is Pompeian in feeling, and in&nbsp;the main its taste is admirable; the execution is of the highest&nbsp;excellence. The tall narrow panels are painted in medallions&nbsp;with amorini; festoons and bouquets of flowers fill every&nbsp;available space; the shutters are painted with doves and&nbsp;shepherdesses. Lagrenée’s pictures in the upper lunettes&nbsp;represent the elements; upon the ceiling is Jupiter enthroned within a deep blue border. The perfection of detail,&nbsp;the unit/of the whole composition, the dexterity 'with which so&nbsp;small a chamber, lofty out of proportion to its length and width,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
