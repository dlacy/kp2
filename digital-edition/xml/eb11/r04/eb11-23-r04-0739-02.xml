                <p><label>ROSS, ALEXANDER</label> (1699-1784), Scottish poet, was born on the 13th
                    of April 1699 at Kincardine-0’Neil, Aberdeenshire. He was educated at Marischal
                    College, Aberdeen, and became tutor to the children of Sir William Forbes of
                    Craigievar. He became in 1732 schoolmaster of Lochlee, Angus, where the rest of
                    his life was spent. He had long been in the habit of writing verse for his own
                    amusement, when in 1768 he published, at the suggestion of James Beattie, <hi
                        rend="italic">The Fortunate Shepherdess . . . to which is (sic) added a few
                        songs.</hi> This is a pastoral narrative poem, written in obvious imitation
                    of Allan Ramsay’s <hi rend="italic">Gentle Shepherd.</hi> Its affectations are
                    chiefly on the surface. The background of shepherd life as known to Ross, and
                    the rather sordid motives of the characters, despite their high-sounding names
                    of Helenore, Rosalind, &amp;c., are depicted with uncompromising truth. He
                    died at Lochlee, and was buried on the 26th of May 1784.</p>

                        Scottish Literature</hi> (1893), ii. 28-34. The bulk of Ross’s writings
                    remain in MS.</p>
