The western empire was governed by a woman in the name of an infant ; but there were two men at the head of its armies equal to the burden of its support and defence, had they not been rendered foes by jealousy and intrigue. These were Bonifacius in Africa, and Ætius in Italy, both men of great abilities, but the latter envious and designing. In order to ruin his less cunning rival, Ætius wrote to Bonifacius to inform him that the empress Placidia wished his death, and meant to recall him from Africa for that purpose ; and at the same time he persuaded Placidia that Bonifacius meant to rebel, and advised her to recall him for the purpose of proving his obedience. When the order reached Bonifacius, it confirmed the fallacious statement of Ætius, and he refused to return ; this refusal convinced Placidia of his traitorous design, and she caused him to be proclaimed a traitor, thus driving him into rebellion. Bonifacius was well aware that he could not hope to contend successfully against the veteran troops of Rome, led by Ætius ; and he therefore had recourse to the aid of Genseric, king of the Vandals, at that time settled in Spain. This ambitious and daring barbarian immediately crossed the straits of Gibraltar, entered Africa, and commenced ε course of dreadful devastation. Bonifacius learned, when too late, how he had been deceived ; and he then attempted, but in vain, to check the progress of the savage invaders. He was defeated, the cities that opposed the Vandals were taken, and Africa was wrested from the power of Rome, and completely overrun by the barbarians.</p><p>As the innocence of Bonifacius had been proved by the deceitful letters of Ætius, he was received on his return to Italy, with marks of favour by the empress. This roused the utmost wrath of Ætius, and a sort of civil war arose between the two rivals, in which Bonifacius was slain ; but the empress, who was now thoroughly acquainted with the treachery of Ætius, proclaimed him a traitor, and he fled to the Huns, with whom he had maintained a secret alliance. In a short time afterwards he returned to Italy, requesting re-admission to the councils of the empire, and supported in his requests by an army of sixty thousand barbarians. Placidia was obliged to accept his proffered assistance, to raise him to the dignity of a patrician, and to the command of the imperial armies, and consequently to the government of the empire.</p><p>No sooner had Ætius secured this object of his ambition, than he resolved to recover the lost province of Africa ; and for this purpose, availing himself of the indignation which .he cruel and barbarous treatment of his sister by Genseric had excited in the mind of Theodoric, king of the Visigoths, he endeavoured to frame such a treaty with that monarch as should induce him to aid the Romans against the common foe. This politic design was however discovered by the crafty barbarian, Genseric, who defeated it by inducing the terrible Attila, king ofthe Huns, to invade the empire. For some time this powerful barbarian had ruled with despotic sway over the whole nation of the Huns, and kept both the courts of Rome and Constantinople in terror, levying a tribute from each, as the price of his temporary forbearance. The death of Theodosius II., and the accession of Marcian, the nominal husband of Pulcheria, infused a more determined spirit into the councils of the eastern empire ; and the fury of Attila might have been directed against it, rather than the west, had it not been for the intrigues of Genseric, who induced the fierce king of the</p><p>Huns to bend his course westward, and pour the torrent of his almost countless multitudes through Germany into Gaul. The haughty barbarian had also another pretext. The princess Honoria, daughter of Valentinian, is said to have offered him her hand ; and Attila, availing himself of the proffer, demanded her in marriage, together with a portion of the empire as her dowry, and advanced at the head of an immense army to enforce his demands. All opposition was in vain, till he reached Orleans in Gaul, which sustained a siege for some time, in the hope of succour from the confiderate forces of Ætius and Theodoric. At length the allied army appeared, when the Huns were actually forcing their way into the town, and Attila called them back, and retired into the plains around Chalons, <hi rend="italic">(in campis Cαtα∙ launicis,)</hi>  to obtain space for the evolutions of his mighty army. After a battle, fierce, varied, obstinate, and bloody, in which the nations from the Wolga to the Atlantic were engaged, Attila was beaten back to his camp, and the field, covered with the dead bodies of 162,000 slain, remained in the possession of Ætius, Theodoric having fallen in the battle. Attila retreated into Germany, still too formidable to be more than harassed on his march.</p><p>During the following spring, he renewed his attempt, but now directed his course into Italy itself, and laid siege to Aquileia, which he took after a protracted and desperate resistance. Ætius could not induce the Visigoths to render him any assistance, and his own forces were unable to meet the vast armies ofthe Huns ; yet he continued to keep the field, and to impede the progress of the dreadful invader. His march was now to be directed against Rome, when he was prevented, partly by the offers of an embassy sent to him from the timid Valentinian, and partly in consequence of a superstitious feeling of apprehension for his own life, both friends and foes reminding him that Alaric had not long survived the taking of Rome. He consented to accept a large ransom and the princess Honoria, threatening to return filled with implacable vengeance, should the stipulations of the treaty not be fulfilled. Soon after his return to his almost imperial village, he fell a victim to intemperance, and died by the bursting of a blood-vessel, on the night after a feast held in honour of his own nuptial engagement with the fair Ildico. Thus perished the terrible Attila, a man of matchless energy of character, a barbarian surpassing all in the barbaric pride and cruelty in which he delighted ; who directed his ambassadors to say to the two emperors of Constantinople and Rome, “ Attila, <hi rend="italic">my</hi>  lord, and <hi rend="italic">thy</hi>  lord, commands thee to provide a palace for his immediate reception ;” who delighted in uttering the ferocious boast, that the grass never more grew on the spot once trodden by his horse ; and who actually adopted the appellation given to him by a trembling enemy, <hi rend="italic">Attila, the scourge of God</hi></p><p>Upon the death of Attila, the kingdom of the Huns was tom to pieces among his followers ; and Rome might have enjoyed safety, had not the jealousy and ingratitude of Valentinian led him to murder with his own hand the brave Ætius, the only person capable of protecting the empire. Not long afterwards, Valentinian himself was killed by the patrician Maximus, whose wife the weak and dissolute tyrant had violated, and who ascended tlle throne thus rendered vacant.</p><p>Soon after his assumption of the imperial dignity, the wife of Maximus dicd ; and wishing to obtain a sanction for his elevation, he married Eudoxia, the widow of Valentinian, and sister of the eastern emperor. In some moment of strange imprudence, he told tlle empress that he had caused the murder of her first husband Valentinian ; and to revenge the deed, she privately invited Genseric, the Vandal conqueror of Africa, to invade Italy, and dethrone the usurper. Genseric had built and equipped a powerful fleet, which rendered him master of the sea, and put it in his</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
