Even here the exit of the sexual&nbsp;products is hardly independent of the aid of the excretory&nbsp;system, since there is reason to regard the abdominal pores&nbsp;as the least modified survivals of segmental organs; and&nbsp;in all higher forms the definite efferent ducts which are&nbsp;present in more or less close relation to the essential&nbsp;generative organs develop in the closest relation to, and in&nbsp;fact at the expense of, the renal excretory apparatus. For&nbsp;an account of the complex details of this process in the&nbsp;higher Vertebrates, however, the reader must consult the&nbsp;classical monographs of Balfour and Semper, or the larger&nbsp;manuals.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Copulation</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">.—We have noted above the importance of the copulatory process to secure fertilization of the ovum,&nbsp;and can thus readily understand its occurrence in the&nbsp;higher members of all the more complex animal groups.&nbsp;Though the result is in all cases the same, the process&nbsp;presents curious variations in principle as well as detail.&nbsp;Thus (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">. &lt;/.) the hermaphrodite Earthworms become firmly&nbsp;attached by their characteristic thickened band of fused&nbsp;rings (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">clitellum</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">). Among the higher Crustaceans the spermatozoa are conducted to the ova along the grooves of a&nbsp;modified pair of the appendages of the male, while in Insects the modifications of the posterior abdominal segments&nbsp;and their limbs for copulatory purposes are often extraordinarily complex and varied. In Spiders, again, the&nbsp;spermatic fluid is passed into a receptacle in the chela, and&nbsp;thence pushed into the cloaca. In the higher </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mollusca,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the complex copulatory apparatus of the Common Snail&nbsp;and the process of hectocotylization among the Cephalo-pods, so curiously analogous to the process in Spiders, are&nbsp;too familiar to need more than mention (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Mollusca,&nbsp;Cuttle-fish). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In many Fishes no copulatory process&nbsp;exists; thus in any of our Salmon rivers the male fish can&nbsp;be seen voiding the milt upon the ova after their deposition. In many Elasmobranchs a portion of the posterior&nbsp;pair of limbs,@@<sup>1</sup> presenting very peculiar cartilaginous&nbsp;and glandular structures, though known as “ claspers,”&nbsp;seems to be introduced into the cloaca during fertilization.&nbsp;But it is among Amphibians that we find the earliest trace&nbsp;of a true penis ; a portion of the cloaca is distinctly ever-sible in Caecilians; in Snakes and Lizards paired eversible&nbsp;processes arise from the posterior cloacal wall, while in&nbsp;Chelonians, Crocodiles, and most Birds it is the anterior&nbsp;wall which bears these processes. In Monotremes, too, the&nbsp;organ is distinctly double; in higher Mammals it is single;&nbsp;but the function is in all cases essentially the same. The&nbsp;nervous, muscular, and circulatory mechanisms of the process are described in works on human physiology. (3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gestation and Birth</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">.—While in the majority of lower forms the offspring leaves the parent as an unfertilized&nbsp;ovum, we have seen even among Sponges the impregnation and development of the embryo in its primitive&nbsp;position, and thus almost from the outset of an ascending&nbsp;zoological survey we can recognize the passage from&nbsp;oviparous to viviparous forms. The Invertebrates, however, are mainly oviparous, despite a few exceptions, of&nbsp;which perhaps the most surprising and aberrant are that of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Entoconcha mirabilis,</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">which exhibits an ordinary Molluscan&nbsp;development within the body of its Holothurian host, and&nbsp;that in what resembles a special ovarian tube, but is really&nbsp;the body of its utterly degenerate parasitic parent. Among</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Insects a certain degree of viviparous development may be reached; and this goes curiously far in the Dipterous&nbsp;Insect </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gecidomyia</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, in which larvae develop within the body&nbsp;of their parents (themselves at the larval stage), the cavity&nbsp;of which they destroy and burst in order to become free.&nbsp;Thus within the same species there comes about exactly the&nbsp;state of things in which the ova of a parasite develop at the&nbsp;expense of its host.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Among Fishes viviparous birth occurs more commonly : in some Teleosteans the young develop within the ovaries;&nbsp;in many Sharks and Dogfish the development takes place&nbsp;within the oviduct, and in one case </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Mustelus Isevis</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">) an&nbsp;actual placenta is formed by the interdigitation of folds of&nbsp;the yolk sac with those of the oviduct. Even the terrestrial Amphibians usually lay their eggs in water, yet in&nbsp;some types, notably the Alpine Salamander </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Salamandra&nbsp;atra</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">), development takes place within the oviduct. That&nbsp;this is a clear case of adaptation to the eminently terrestrial&nbsp;environment has indeed been well shewn by experiments in&nbsp;which the young larvae taken from the parent and transferred to pond water developed like ordinary Newts. To&nbsp;all such forms, viviparous in the sense of bringing forth&nbsp;their young alive, the somewhat confusing term “ ovovivi-parous” is often applied. Birds, and also Reptiles, with&nbsp;few exceptions, of which the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ichthyosauria</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> seem to have&nbsp;presented a striking case, are oviparous ; so too, as has been&nbsp;recently established by Caldwell, is the in all respects so&nbsp;curiously Bird-like Mammal </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Echidna.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Its congener </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Orni-thorhynchus</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> probably agrees in this; but in Marsupials the&nbsp;embryo is not born until it has reached a comparatively&nbsp;advanced state of development, when it is transferred to&nbsp;the brood pouch or marsupium, where the process is completed. In the remaining </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mammalia</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> intra-uterine development goes much farther, the nutrition of the embryo being,&nbsp;in absence of the abundant food yolk of lower forms,&nbsp;effected by the aid of a placenta analogous but not homologous to that of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mustelus</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, since developed, not from the yolk-sac, but from the allantois (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Anatomy </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Mammalia).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The physiological processes of birth show a similar rise in complexity,—due chiefly to the increasing strain upon&nbsp;the parental organization which this progress in the&nbsp;nutrition and protection of the embryo during its development involves; for, while an ovum can be extruded by&nbsp;simple ciliary action, or at most by the gentle contractions&nbsp;of the oviduct, the expulsion of the relatively enormous&nbsp;Mammalian foetus involves mechanical difficulties of the&nbsp;most serious kind. And, besides these stresses and strains&nbsp;upon the pelvic basin itself or the muscular and connective&nbsp;tissues of the uterus, vagina, and its outlet, the inevitable&nbsp;rending asunder of the large closely interwoven and highly&nbsp;vascular placenta must evidently occasion an additional&nbsp;physiological disturbance. (4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parental Care</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">.—Not to mention cases of mere concealment of the ova or construction of egg cases, the lowest forms exhibiting such parental care are probably certain&nbsp;Holothurians and Starfishes described by Sir Wyville&nbsp;Thomson during the voyage of the “ Challenger,” in which&nbsp;the developing young are borne upon the dorsal surface of&nbsp;the parent. Many Crustaceans carry about their ova during&nbsp;development, and an Amphipod has been described as followed by its newly-hatched young like a hen by its chickens.&nbsp;The female Spider too, though ferocious towards the male,&nbsp;frequently spins a nest and shows some maternal solicitude;&nbsp;but such cases are far commoner among even the lower&nbsp;Vertebrates than the highest Invertebrates. Thus among&nbsp;Fishes the case of the nest-building Stickleback is especially&nbsp;familiar; some Siluroids and Lophobranchs (and usually&nbsp;the males) carry about their young,—the latter in ventral&nbsp;pouches, the former in the mouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">But the quaintest examples of care of offspring are those</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
