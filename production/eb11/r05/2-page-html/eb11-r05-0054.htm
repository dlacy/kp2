<p><span class="font1">RUBIACEAE, in botany, a large natural order of seed plants, belonging to the series Rubiales of the subclass Sympetalae&nbsp;(Gamopetalae) of Dicotyledons, and containing about 350&nbsp;genera with about 4500 species. It is mainly a tropical family&nbsp;of trees, shrubs and herbs, but some of the tribes, especially&nbsp;Galieae, to which the British representatives belong and which&nbsp;contains only herbs, are more strongly developed in temperate&nbsp;regions; some species of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Galium</span><span class="font1"> reach the Arctic zone and are&nbsp;found at high elevations on mountains in the tropics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The most striking characteristic of the family are the opposite-decussate, generally entire, stipulate leaves. The stipules are very varied in form; they generally stand between the petioles of a pair&nbsp;of leaves (interpctiolar). The two stipules of adjacent leaves «are&nbsp;usually united, and in the Galieae, as well shown in the British&nbsp;species, are enlarged and lcaf-like, forming with the two leaves an&nbsp;apparent whorl ; by fusion or branching of the stipules the number of&nbsp;leaves in the whorl varies from four to eight or more. The flowers are&nbsp;rarely solitary, terminal or axillary, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gardenia;</span><span class="font0"> generally they&nbsp;are arranged in cymes or panicles or crowded into heads, and are&nbsp;often showy; in British members of the family they are very small,&nbsp;but may be conspicuous from their numbers, as in lady’s bedstraw&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Galium verum).</span><span class="font0"> The flowers are hermaphrodite and regular with&nbsp;parts in fours or fives; the four or five sepals, petals and stamens&nbsp;are placed above the ovary, which consists of two carpels, contains&nbsp;one to indefinite anatropous ovules in each of the two chambers,&nbsp;and is crowned by a simple style ending in a head or in two lobes.&nbsp;The sepals are often small, sometimes reduced to a narrow ring&nbsp;encircling the top of the ovary or altogether absent. The united&nbsp;petals form a corolla which varies widely in form in the different&nbsp;genera; it is often funnel- or salver-shaped, the honey, which is&nbsp;secreted by a disk round the base of tjie style, being at the bottom&nbsp;of a longer or shorter tube, in which case the flowers are adapted&nbsp;for pollination by Lepidoptera or bees, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gardenia, Mussaenda,&nbsp;Guettarda,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c.; in other cases it is bell-shaped, or, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Galium,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">rotate, with a short tube and sharply spreading segments; the&nbsp;honey is in these cases freely exposed or only slightly concealed&nbsp;and the flowers are pollinated by flies. The stamens are attached&nbsp;to the corolla-tube and alternate in position with its segments;&nbsp;the flowers are often dimorphic (or heterostyled) with short-styled&nbsp;and long-styled forms as in ipecacuanha (see. fig.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The fruit also varies widely in form and is dry or fleshy. When dry it forms a capsule with septicidal or loculicidal dehiscence, or is&nbsp;a schizoearp separating when dry into two one-seeded mericarps&nbsp;which, as in the British cleavers </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Galium Aparine),</span><span class="font0"> sometimes bear&nbsp;hooked appendages which aid their dispersal..</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some genera show a remarkable association with ants. Thus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Myrmecodia, Hydnophytum</span><span class="font0"> are epiphytic plants, in which the base&nbsp;of the stem forms a large tuber, which is attached to the support by&nbsp;numerous adventitious roots. The. substance of the tuber is penetrated by numerous cork-lined cavities communicating by galleries,&nbsp;which are inhabited by ants. There is no evidence that the presence&nbsp;of the ants is of any service to the plant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The order is divided into a large number of tribes based on the number of ovules in each ovary-chamber, the character of the fruit&nbsp;seed and ovule, and the aestivation of the corolla. These may be&nbsp;arranged in three families as follows :—.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cinchoneae,</span><span class="font0"> often woody plants with scale-like stipules, and numerous ovules in each ovary-chamber; the fruit is generally a&nbsp;capsule. To this belong </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cinchona</span><span class="font0"> (g.v.), a genus of large trees with&nbsp;handsome flowers, containing about forty species in the Andes of&nbsp;South America—it is well known as the source of Peruvian bark.&nbsp;An allied genus, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bouvardia</span><span class="font0"> (g.r.), from tropical America, is cultivated&nbsp;for its flowers. The species of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Uncaria</span><span class="font0"> climb by means of hooks&nbsp;which are modified inflorescence-axes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mussaenda, Gardenia</span><span class="font0"> (g.n.), and other genera are characterized by having a fleshy fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">-Coffeeae,</span><span class="font0"> often woody or shrubby plants with scale-like stipules; each ovary-chamber contains only one ovule. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Coffee (q.v.),</span><span class="font0"> a genus&nbsp;of shrubs with about twenty-five species in the Old World tropics,&nbsp;includes the coffee plant </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(C. arabica</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">C. liberica) ;</span><span class="font0"> the fruit is a&nbsp;two-seeded drupe, the seed is the “ coffee-bean.” The thickened&nbsp;root of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Uragoga ipecacuanha</span><span class="font0"> yields ipecacuanha </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Stellateae,</span><span class="font0"> herbaceous plants with leaf-like stipules; each ovary-chamber contains one ovule only. Includes the four British genera </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rubia,</span><span class="font0"> one species of which, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. tinctorum,</span><span class="font0"> is madder; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Galium,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">including </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">G. verum</span><span class="font0"> (lady’s bedstraw), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">G. Aparine</span><span class="font0"> (goose-grass or&nbsp;cleavers), and other British species; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Asperula,</span><span class="font0"> including </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A. odor ala&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(woodruff) and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sherardia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The order is closely allied to Caprifoliaceac, the chief distinction being the absence of stipules in the latter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUBICON, a small stream of ancient Italy, which flowed into the Adriatic between Ariminum and Caesena, and formed the&nbsp;boundary between Italy and the province of Cisalpine Gaul.&nbsp;Hence Caesar’s crossing of it in 49 b.c. was tantamount to a&nbsp;declaration of war against Rome as represented by Pompey and&nbsp;the Senate. The historic importance of this event gave rise&nbsp;to the phrase “ crossing the Rubicon ” for a step which definitely&nbsp;commits a person to a given course of action. There has been&nbsp;much controversy as to the identification of the stream; it&nbsp;appears that its upper course is represented by that of the&nbsp;Pisciatello (called Rubigone in the nth or 12th century and now&nbsp;Rugone or Urgone), and its lower portion by the Fiumicino,&nbsp;which the Urgone once joined. The point was marked by a&nbsp;station on the Via Aemilia below their confluence, 12 m. N.W.&nbsp;of Ariminum, bearing the name </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ad Confluenles;</span><span class="font1"> and here is&nbsp;still preserved a three-arched bridge, larger than is necessary&nbsp;for the water carried by the present Fiumicino.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUBIDIUM [symbol Rb, atomic weight 85-45 (O = i6)], a metallic element belonging to the group of the alkali metals.&nbsp;It is found in the minerals lepidolite, petalite and in various&nbsp;specimens of mica and of carnallite, and in some mineral&nbsp;waters. It also occurs in tea, cocoa, coffee, tobacco and in&nbsp;the ashes of beetroot. It was discovered by R. Bunsen and&nbsp;Kirchhoff </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Ann.,</span><span class="font1"> i860,113, p. 337), in the spectroscopic examination of the residues obtained on evaporation of water from&nbsp;a mineral spring at Durkheim, being characterized by two&nbsp;distinctive red lines. The best source of rubidium salts is the&nbsp;residue left after extracting lithium salts from lepidolite, the&nbsp;method of separation being based on the different solubilities&nbsp;of the platino-chlorides of potassium, rubidium and caesium</span></p>
