Every man who has but dipt into the ſcience of metaphyſics knows, and no man ever knew better than he who is believed to have been the author of the work before us, that time unperceived paffes away as in an inſtant; and that if the ſoul be in a ſtate void of conſciohſneſs between death and the reſurrection, the man who has lain in his grave iooo years will appear to himſelf to have died in one moment and been raifed in the next, we would likewiſe recommend to thoſe who may henceforth be inclined to inculcate any thing as a doctrine of Scripture merely on account of its ſuppoſed expediency, always to remember that God is above, that they are below, that he is omniſcient, that they are of yeſtcrday aud know little, that their words therefore ſhould be wary and few, and that they ſhould always ſpeak with reſpect of whatever concerns the Sovereign of the univerſe, or relates to his government either in the natural or mo∙ ral world. For wilt thou, fays the Higheſt, diſannul</p><p>my judgement? wilt thou condemn me that thou may-cſt be righteous ? ſhall he that contendeth with the Al-mighty inſtruct him ? He that reproveth God let him anſwer it.</p><p>If, in ſtating theſe oppoſite opinions, we may ſeem to have favoured what has been called the ſleep of the ſoul, it is not from any conviction of its truth, for there are particular texts of Scripture which appear to us to militate againſt it. W6 are ſatisſied, however, that it is a very harmlefs opinion, neither injurious to the reſt of the articles of the Chriſtian faith nor to virtuous practice ; and that thoſe who have poured forth torrents of obloquy upon ſuch as may have held it in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, have either miſtaken the doctrine which they condemned, or been poffeffed by a ſpirit leſs mild than that of the gofpel (x).</p><p>whatever be the fate of the middle ſtate, the reſurrection ſtands on a different baſis. It is repeatedly af-ſerted in Scripture; and thoſe grounds on which we believe it are authenticated facts, which the affectation, the ingenuity, and the hatred of ſceptics, have number-leſs times attempted in vain to diſprove. Theſe facts we are now to conſider, referring our readers for the character of the witneffes, the authenticity of the <hi rend="italic">go· </hi>ſpel-hiſtory, and the poſſibility of miracles, to the parts of this work where theſe ſubjects are treated (See Miracle, Metaphysics, Part I. Chap. vii. and Religion) ; or, ſhould more particular information be required, to the writings of Ditton, Sherlock, and well.</p><p>o nr Lord, after proving his divine miſſion by the miracles which he wrought, and by the completion of ancient predictions in which he was deſcribed, declared</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Vol. XVI. Part I.</hi></p><p>that the doctrine of a refurrection was one of thofe truths which he came to announce. To ſhow that ſuch an event was poſſible, he reftored to life the daughter of Jairus, a ruler of the ſynagogue, a young man of Nain, who was carried out on his bier to be buried, and his friend Lazarus, whoſe body at the time was thought to have become the prey of corruption. Though the two ſirſt of thefe miracles were wrought in the preſence of a number of witneſtes, yet the laſt, owing to particular circumſtances, produced a much greater noiſe among the Jews. It was performed on a perfon ſeemingly of ſome note, in the village of Bethany, not far from Jeruſalem, and in the preſence of a great many perſons who from the metropolis had come to condole with</p><p>Mary and Martha. No doubts were entertained of the reality of Lazarus’s death, ∩ur Lord was at a diſtance when he expired, and his body had already been lying for ſome days in the grave, when he came forth at the voice of our Lord, all were aſtoniihed. Thoſe from Jeruſalem, on returning home, are impatient to relate what they had ſeen ; thoſe who heard of ſo memorable an event cannot conceal it ; the report reaches the ears of the Phariſees and chief prieſts. They are ſoon made acquainted with every circumſtance ; and dreading the iſtue, they think it neceffary to call a council upon the occaſion, and concert the meaſures that ought to be purſued in a matter which was likely to be attended with ſo many and important conſequenccs. In this council, it feemed to be agreed that our Lord had performed, and was ſtill continuing to perform, many mi-racles : That this laff miracle, as being of an extraordinary kind, would make many converts ; and that if meafnres were not ſpeedily taken to prevent theſe uncommon diſplays of his power, all would believe on him : the jealouſy of the Romans would be excited, the rulers depofed, and the nation of the Jews deprived of its few remaining privileges. Yet, notwithſtanding theſe private conceſſions made in the council, the members who dreaded to let their ſentiments be known to the people, affect in public to treat our Saviour as an im-poftor. But he who already had demonſtrated the abfurdity of their opinion, who ſuppoſed that his miracles were wrought by Beelzebub prince of the devils, is again ready to confute the ridiculous affertion of thoſe who pretended to ſay that they were a deception. His friend Lazarus was ſtill living at the diſtance of only a few miles, and many of the Jews who had gone to ſee him were ready to atteſt the truth of the report. If the rulers, apprehending the conſequences of the truth, be afraid to know it, and if they are unwilling to go to Bethany, or to ſend for Lazarus and thoſe who were preſent at his reſurrection, our Lord gives them a fair opportunity of detecting his fraud, if there was any ſuch to be found in him. 'Γo preſerve their power, and re-move the jealous ſuſpicion of the Romans, it had been already determined in council to put him to death ; and</p><p>(x) Perhaps no man has been more culpable in this reſpect than the celebrated warburton, who ſeems at ſirſt to have himſelf denied an intermediate ſtate of conſcions exiſtence. He afterwards imagined that luch a ſtate is ſuppoſed, though not expreſsly afferted, in Scripture ; and at laſt he maintained it with all the zeal and warmth of a profelyte. To prove the ſincerſty of his converſion, he treated his adverſaries with ſcurrilous •nicknames, banter, and abuſe ; a ſpecies of reaſoning which ſeldom ſucceeds in recommending a bad cauſe, and f.dιιeh never confers credit on one that is good.</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
