The idolatrous religion which prevailed among thoſe tribes before their converfion to Chriſtianity, inſtead of diſpoſing them to cultivate humanity and mildneſs of manners, contributed ſtrongly to render them fierce and blood-thirſty, and eager to diſtinguiſh themſelves by deeds of ſavage valour. But no ſooner had they fettled in the dominions of Rome, and embraced the principles of Chriſtianity, than they became a mild and generous people.</p><p>we are informed by Moſheim, who was at pains to collect his materials from the moſt authentic ſources, that in the loth century Chriſtian princes exerted themſelves in the converfion of nations whoſe ſierceneſs they had experienced, in order to ſoſten and render them more gentle. The mutual humanity with which nations at war treat each other in modern times, is certainly owing, in a great meaſure, to the influence of the mild precepts of the Goſpel. It is a fact worthy of notice too, that during the barbarous ages, the ſpiritual courts of juſtice were more rational and impartial in their deciſions than civil tribunals.</p><p>How many criminal practices which prevailed among heathen nations have been aboliſhed by their converſion to Chriſtianity ! Chriſtians of all nations have been obſerved to retain the virtues and reject the vicious practices of their reſpective countries. In Parthia, where polygamy prevailed, they are not polygamiſts ; in Perſia, the Chriſtian father does not marry his own daughter. By the laws of Zoroaſter the Perſtans committed inceſt until they embraced the Goſpel ; after which period they abſtained from that crime, and obſerved the duties of chaſtity and temperance, as enjoined by its precepts. Even the poliſhed and enlightened Romans were cruel and blood-thirſty before the propagation of the Goſpel. The breaking of a glaſs, or iome inch trifling offence, was ſuſſicient to provoke vidius Pυllio to caſt his ∩aves into ſiſh-ponds to be devoured by lampreys. The effuſion of human blood was their favourite entertainment ; they delighted to ſee men combating with beaſts, or with one another ; and we are informed on reſpectable authority, that no wars ever made ſucſh havock on mankind as the fights of gladiators, which ſometimes deprived Europe of 20,000 lives in one month. Not the humanity oſ Titus, nor the wiſdom and virtue of Trajan, could abohſh the barbarous fpectacle. However humane and wiſe in other inftances, in this practice thoſe princes complied with the cuſtom oſ their country, and exhibited ſplendid ſhows of gladiators, in which the combatants were matched by pairs ; who, though they had never injured nor offended each Other, yet were obliged to maim and murder one another in cold blood. Chriſtian divines ſoon exerciſed their pens againſt theſe horrid practices; the Chriſtian emperor Conſtantine reſtrained them by edicts, and Ho-norius finally aboliſhed them. It would be tedious to proceed through an enumeration of particulars ; but wherever Chriſtianity has been propagated, it has conſtantly operated to the civilization oſ the manners of mankind, and to the abolition of abſurd and criminal practices. The Iriſh, the Scotch, and all the ancient inhabitants of the Britiſh iſles, were, notwithſtanding</p><lb/><p>their intercourfe with the Romans, rude barbarians, till ſuch time as they were converted to Chriſtianity. The inhuman practice of expofing infants, which once pre-vailed ſo generally over the world, and ſtill prevails a-mong ſome Pagan nations, even under very humane and enlightened legiſlatures, yielded to the influence of Chriſtianity.</p><p>Let us likewiſe remember, in honour of Chriſtianity, that it has contributed eminently to the diffuiion of knowledge, the preſervation and the advancement of learning. AVhen the barbarians overſpread Europe, wſhat muſt have become of the precious remains of poliſhed, enlightened antiquity, had there been no other depoſttaries to preſerve them but the heathen prieſts ? we allow that even the Romiſh clergy during the dark ages did not ſtudy the celebrated models of ancient times with much advantage themſelves, and did not labour with much aſſiduity to make the laity acquainted with them. It muſt even be acknowledged, that they did not always preſerve thoſe monuments of genius with ſuſſicient care, as they were often ignorant of their real value. Yet, after all, it will be granted, it cannot be denied, that had it not been ſor the clergy of the Chriſtian church, the lamp of learning would, in all probability, have been entirely extinguiſhed, during that night of ignorance and barbarity in which all Europe were buried for a long ſeries of centuries, after the irruption of the barbarians into the Roman em</p><p>pire.</p><p>Such is the excellence of the Chriſtian ſyſtem, and ſuch its tendency to meliorate the human character, that its beneficial influence lias not been confined to thoſe who have received its doctrines and precepts, and have profeffed themſelves Chriſtians; it has even produced many happy effects on the circumſtances and the characters oſ Pagans and infidels, who have had opportunities of beholding the virtues of Chriſtians, and learning the excellence of the morality of the goſpel. Thoſe virtues which diſtinguifiied the character of the apoſtate Julian were ſurely owing in no inconfiderable degree to his acquaintance with Chriſtianity ; and it is an undeniable fact, that after the propagation of Chriſtianity through the Roman empire, even while the purity of that holy religion was gradually debaſed, the manners of thoſe Pagans who remained unconverted became more pure, and their religious doctrines and worſhip leſs immoral and abſurd.— We might here adduce a tedious ſeries of facts to the ſame purpoſe. whenever Chriſtians have had any intercourfe with Pagan idolaters, and have not concealed the laws of the goſpel, nor ſhown by their conduct that they diſ-regarded them, even thoſe who have not been converted to Chriſtianity have, however, been improved in their diſpoſitions and manners by its influence. The emperor, whoſe virtues we have mentioned as arifing, in a certain degree, from his acquaintance with Chriſtianity, in a letter to an Heathen pontiff, deſires him to turn his eyes to the means by which the ſuperſtition of Chriſtians was propagated: bykindneſs to ſtrangers, by ſanctity of life, and by the attention which they paid to the burial of the dead. He recommends an imitation of their virtues, exhorts him to canſe the prieſts of Galatia to be attentive to the worſhip of their gods, and authoriſes him to ſtrip them of the ſacerdotal function, unleſs they obliged their wives, children, and ſervants,</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
