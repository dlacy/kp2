<p><label>RESTOUT</label>
Jean (1692-1768), French painter, born at Rouen, March 26, 1692, was the son of Jean Restout, the first of that name, and of Marie M. Jouvenet, sister and pupil of the well-known Jean Jouvenet. Jean Restout’s father died young, and his son was placed at Paris with his uncle Jean Jouvenet. In 1717, the Royal Academy having elected him a member on the work which he had executed for the Great Prize, he remained in Paris, instead of proceeding to Italy, exhibited at all the salons, and filled successively every post of academical distinction. He died on January 1, 1768. He left several pupils, none of whom were of great distinction. His works, chiefly of vast size—altarpieces (Louvre Museum), ceilings, designs for Gobelin tapestries—were much engraved by Cochin, Drevet, and others ; his diploma picture may still be seen at St Cloud.</p>
