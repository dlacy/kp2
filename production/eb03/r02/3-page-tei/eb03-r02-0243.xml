We cannot help thinking, that much of their practice reſults from a <hi rend="italic">pedantic </hi>veneration for the beautiſul productions of Grecian architecture. Such architects as have written on the principles of the art in reſpect of proportions, or what they call the ordonnance, are very much puzzled to make a chain of reaſoning ; and the moſt that they have made of the Greek architecture is, that it exhibits a nice adjuſtment of ſtrength and ſtrain. But when we conſider the extent of this adjuſtment, we find that it is wonderfully limited. The whole of it conſiſts of a baſcment, a column, and an entablature ; and the entablature, it is true, exhibits ſomething of a connection with the framework and roof of a wooden building ; and we believe that it really originated from this in the hands of the orientals, from whom the Greeks certainly borrowed their forms and their combinations. We could eaſily ſhow in the ruins of Perſepolis, and among the tombs in the mountains (which were long prior to the Greek architecture), the fluted column, the baſe, the Ionic and Corinthian capital, and the Doric arrangement of lintels, beams, and rafters, all derived from unqueſtionable principle. The only addition made by the Greeks was the pent roof ; and the changes made by them in the ſubordinate forms of things are ſuch as we ſhould expect ſrom their exquiſite judgment of beauty.</p><p>But the whole of this is very limited ; and the Greeks, after making the roof a chief feature of a houſe, went no farther, and contented themſelves with giving it a ſlope ſuited to their climate. This we have followed, becauſe in the milder parts of Europe we have no cogent reaſon for deviating from it ; and if any architect ſhould deviate greatly in a building where the outline is exhibited as beautiful, we ſhould be diſguſted ; but the diſguſt, though felt by almoſt every ſpectator, has its origin in nothing but habit.. In the profeiſed architect or man of education, the diſguſt ariſes from pedantry: for there is not ſuch a cloſe connection between the form and uſes of a roof as ſhall give precife determinations ; and the mere form is a matter of indifference.</p><p>We ſhould not therefore reprobate the high-pitched roofs of our anceſtors, particularly on the continent. It is there where we ſee them in all the extremity of the faſhion, and the taſte is by no means exploded as it is with us. A baronial caſtle in Germany and France is ſeldom rebuilt in the pure Greek ſtyle, or even like the modern houſes in Britain ; the high-pitched roofs are retained. We ſhould not call them Gothic, and ugly becauſe Gothic, till we ſhow their principle to be falſe or taſteleſs. Now we apprehend that it will be found quite the reverſe ; and that though we cannot bring ourſelves to think them beautiful, we ought to think them ſo. The conſtruction of the Greek architecture is a transference of the practices that are neceſſary in a wooden building to a building of ſtone. To this the Greeks have adhered, in ſpite of innumerable difficulties. Their marble quarries, however, put it in their power to retain the proportions which habit had rendered agreeable. But it is next to impoſſible to adhere to theſe proportions with freeſtone or brick, when the order is of magnificent dimenſions. Sir Chriſtopher Wren ſaw this; for his mechanical knowledge was equal to his taſte. He compoſed the front of St Paul’s church in London of two orders, and he coupled his columns ; and ſtill the lintels which form the architrave are of ſuch length that they could carry no additional weight, and he was obliged to truſs them behind. Had he made but one order, the architrave could not have carried its own weight. It is impoſſible to execute a Doric entablature of this ſize in brick. It is attempted in a very noble front, the Academy of Arts in St Peterſhurgh. But the architect was obliged to make the mutules and other projecting members of the corniche of granite, and many of them broke down by their own weight.</p><p>Here is ſurely an error in principle. Since ſtone is the chief material of our buildings, ought not the members Qf ornamented architecture to be refinements on the eſſential and unaffected parts of a ſimple ſtone-.building. There is almoſt as much propriety in the architecture of India, where a dome is made in imita-tation of a lilly or other flower inverted, as in the Greek imitation of a wooden building. The principles of maſonry, and not of carpentry, ſhould be ſeen in our architecture, if we would have it according to the rules of juſt taſte. Now we affirm that this is the characteriſtic feature of what is called the Gothic architecture. In this no dependence is had on the tranſverſe ſtrength of ſtone·. No lintels are to be ſeen ; no extravagant projections. Every ſtone is preſſed to its neighbours, and none is expoſed to a tranſverſe ſtrain. The Greeks were enabled to execute their coloſſal buildings only by uſing immenſe blocks of the hardeſt materials. The Norman maſon could raiſe a building to the ikies without uſing a ſtone which a labourer could not carry to the top on his back. Their architects ſtudied the principles of equilibrium j<hi rend="sub">x</hi>and having attained a wonderful knowledge of it, they indulged themſelves in exhibiting remarkable inſtances. We call this falſe taſte, and ſay that the appearance of inſecurity is the greateſt fault. But this is owing to our habits : our thoughts may be ſaid to run in a∙ wooden train, and certain ſimple maxims of carpentry are familiar to our imagination ; and in the careful adherence to theſe conſiſts the beauty and ſymmetry of the Greek architecture. Had we been as much habituated to the equilibrium of preſſure, this apparent inſecurity would not have met our eye : we would have perceived the ſtrength, and we ſhould have reliſhed the ingenuity.</p><p>The Gothic architecture is perhaps intitled to the name of rational architecture, and its beauty is founded on the characteriſtic diſtinction of our ſpecies. It deſerves cultivation : not the pitiful, ſervile, and un-ſkilled copying of the monuments ; this will produce incongruities and abſurdities equal to any that have crept into the Greek architecture : but let us examine with attention the nice diſpoſition of the groins and ſpaundrels ; let us ſtudy the tracery and knots, not as ornaments, but as uſeful members ; let us obſerve how they have made their walls like honey-combs, and admire their ingenuity as we pretend to admire the inſtinct infuſed by the great architect into the bee. All this cannot be underſtood without mechanical knowledge ; a thing which few of our profeſſional architects have any ſhare of. Thus would architectonic taſte be a mark of ſkill ; and the perſon who preſents the deſign of a building would know how to excite it, without committing it entirely to the maſon and carpenter.</p><p>Theſe obſervations are not a digreſſion from our ſub-</p></body></text></TEI>
