                <p><label>ROBERT OF GLOUCESTER</label> English chronicler, is known only through his
                    connexion with the work which bears his name. This is a vernacular history of
                    England, from the days of the legendary Brut to the year 1270, and is written in
                    rhymed couplets. The lines arc of fourteen syllables, with a break , after the
                    eighth syllable. The author gives his name as Robert; the dialect which he uses,
                    and his acquaintance with local traditions, justify the supposition that he was
                    a monk of Gloucester. He describes, from his own recollections, the bad weather
                    which prevailed in the neighbourhood of Evesham on the day of the battle between
                    the Montfortians and Prince Edward (1265). He also alluded to the canonization
                    of Louis IX. of France, which took place in 1297. He probably wrote about the year
                    1300. The earlier part of his chronicle (up to 1135) may be from another hand,
                    since it occurs in some manuscripts in a shorter form, and with an exceedingly
                    brief continuation by an anonymous versifier. There is no good reason for the
                    theory that this part was translated from a French original; nor docs it contain
                    any undoubted borrowings from French sources. The authorities employed for the
                    earlier part were Geoffrey of Monmouth, Henry of Huntingdon, William of
                    Malmesbury, the English Chronicles, and some minor sources; Robert, in making
                    his recension of it, also used the <hi rend="italic">Brut</hi> of Layamon. From
                    1135 to 1256 Robert is still a compiler, although references to oral tradition
                    become more frequent as he approaches his own time. From 1256 to 1270 he has the
                    value of a contemporary authority. But he is more important to the philologist
                    than to the historian. His chronicle is one of the last works written in Old
                    English.</p>
               <p>Robert’s chronicle was first edited by T. Hearne (2 vols., Oxford, 1724); but
                    this text is now superseded by that of W. Aldis Wright (2 vols., Rolls Series,
                    1887). Minor works attributed to the author are: a <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">St Alban</hi> in verse (MS. Ashmole 43); a <hi rend="italic"
                        >Life of St Patrick,</hi> also in verse (MS. Tanner 17); a <hi rend="italic"
                        >Life of St Bridget</hi> (MS. C.C.C. Cambridge, 145); and a <hi
                        rend="italic">Life of St Alphege</hi> (MS. Cott., Julius D. ix). A <hi
                        rend="italic">Martyrdom of St Thomas Becket</hi> and a <hi rend="italic"
                        >Life of St Brendan,</hi> both attributed to Robert, were printed by the
                    Percy Society in 1845.</p>
