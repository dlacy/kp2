<p><span class="font0">The conſpirators, to give a colour of juſtice to their proceedings, remitted the execution of this deſign to&nbsp;the ides of March, the day on which it was reported&nbsp;that Cæſar was to be offered the crown. The augurs&nbsp;had foretold that this day would be fatal to him ; and&nbsp;the night preceding, he heard his wife Calphurnia lamenting in her ſleep, and being awakened, ihe con-feſſed to him that the dreamt of his being aiΓaffιnated&nbsp;in her arms. Theſe omens, in ſome meaſure, began to&nbsp;change his intentions of going to the ſenate, as he had&nbsp;reſolved, that day ; but one of the conſpirators coming&nbsp;in, prevailed upon him to keep his reſolution, telling&nbsp;him of the reproach which would attend his Haying&nbsp;at home till his wife had lucky dreams,, and of the&nbsp;preparations that were made for his appearance. As&nbsp;he went along to the ſenate, a ſlave, who haſtened to&nbsp;him with information of the conſpiracy, attempted to&nbsp;come near him, but could not lor the crowd. Arte-rnidorus, a Greek philoſopher, who had diſcovered the&nbsp;whole plot, delivered to him a memorial, containing&nbsp;the heads of lſis information ; but Cæſar gave it, with&nbsp;other papers, to one of his ſecretaries without reading,&nbsp;as was uſual in things of this nature. As ſoon as he&nbsp;had taken his place in the ſenate, the conſpirators&nbsp;came near him, under a pretence of ſaluting him ; and&nbsp;Cimber, who was one of them, approached in a ſup-pliant poſture, pretending to ſue for his brother’s pardon, who was baniſhed by his order. All the conſpirators ſeconded him with great tenderneſs ; and Cim-ber, ſeeming to ſue with ſtill greater ſubmiſſion, took&nbsp;hold of the bottom of his robe, holding him ſo as to&nbsp;prevent his riſing. TTιis was the ſignal agreed on.&nbsp;Caſca, who was behind, ſtabbed him, though flightly,&nbsp;in the ihoulder. Cæſar inſtantly turned round, and&nbsp;with the ſtyle of lſis tablet wounded him in the arm.&nbsp;However, all the conſpirators were now alarmed ; and&nbsp;incloſing him round, he received a ſecond ſtah from an&nbsp;unknown hand in the breaſt, while Caffius wounded&nbsp;him in the face. He ſtill defended himſelf with great&nbsp;vigour, ruihing among them, and throwing down ſuch&nbsp;as oppoſed him, till he ſaw Brutus among the conſpira-tors, who, coming up, ſtruck his dagger in his thigh.&nbsp;From that moment Cæſar thought no more of defending himſelf, but looking upon this conſpirator, cried out,&nbsp;** And you too, Brutus !” Then covering his head,&nbsp;and ſpreading his robe before him in order to fall with&nbsp;greater decency, he ſunk down at the baſe of Pompey’s&nbsp;ſtatue, after receiving three and twenty wounds, in the&nbsp;56th year of his age, and 4th of his reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As ſoon as the conſpirators had diſpatched Cæſar, they began to addreſs themſelves to the ſenate, in order to vindicate the motives of their enterpriſe, and to&nbsp;excite them to join in procuring their country’s freedom; but all the ſenators who were not accomplices fled&nbsp;with ſuch precipitation, that the lives of ſome of them&nbsp;were endangered in the throng. The people alſo being&nbsp;now alarmed, left their uſual occupations, and ran tumul-tuouily through «the city ; ſome actuated by their fears,&nbsp;and ſtill more by a deſire of plunder. In this ſtate of&nbsp;confuſion, the conſpirators all retired to the capitol, and&nbsp;guarded its acceiſes by a body of gladiators which Brutus had in pay.. It was in vain<sub>1</sub> they alleged they only&nbsp;ſtruck for freedom, and that they killed a tyrant who&nbsp;uſurped the rights of mankind : the people, accuſtom-ed te luxury and eaſe, little regarded their profeſ-</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">ſions, dreading more the dangers of poverty than e&gt;* ſubjection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The friends of the late dictator now began to find that this was the time for coming into greater power&nbsp;than before, and for ſatisfying their ambition under the&nbsp;veil of promoting juſtice. Of this number was Antony, whom we have already ſeen acting as a lieutenant&nbsp;under Cæſar. He was a man of moderate abilities&nbsp;and exceſſive vices ; ambitious of power, but ſkilled in&nbsp;war, to which be had been trained from his youth.&nbsp;He was conſul for this year ; and reſolved, with Lepidus, who was fond of commotions like himſelf, to&nbsp;ſeize this opportunity of aſſuming the ſovereign power.&nbsp;Lepidus, therefore, took poſſeſſion of the forum with&nbsp;a band of ſoldiers at his devotion ; and Antony, being&nbsp;conſul, was permitted to command them. Their firſt&nbsp;ſtep was to poſſeſs themſelves of all Cæſar’s papers and&nbsp;money ; and the next to convene the ſenate, in order&nbsp;to determine whether Cæſar had been a legal magiſtrate&nbsp;or a tyrannical uſurper, and whether thoſe who killed&nbsp;him merited rewards or puniſhments. There were many&nbsp;of theſe who had received their promotions ſrom Cæſar,&nbsp;and had acquired large fortunes in conſequence of his&nbsp;appointments : to vote him an uſurper,'»therefore, would&nbsp;be to endanger their property ; and yet to vote him innocent, might endanger the ſtate. In this dilemma&nbsp;they ſeemed willing to reconcile extremes ; wherefore&nbsp;they approved all the acts of Cæſar, and yet granted a&nbsp;general pardon to all the conſpirators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This decree was very far from giving Antony ſatisſaction, as it granted ſecurity to a number of men who were the avowed enemies of tyranny, and who would&nbsp;be foremoſt in oppoſing his ſchemes of reſtoring abſolute power. As therefore the ſenate had ratified all&nbsp;Cæſar’s acts without diſtinction, he formed a ſeheme&nbsp;upon tlſis of making him rule when dead as imperiouſ-ly as he had done when living. Being, as was ſaid,&nbsp;poſſeſſed of Cæſar’s books of accounts, he ſo ſar gained upon his ſecretary as to make him inſert whatever&nbsp;he thought proper. By theſe means, great ſums of&nbsp;money, which Cæſar never would have beſtowed, were&nbsp;here diſtributed among the people ; and every man who&nbsp;was averſe to republican principles was here ſure of&nbsp;finding a gratuity. He then demanded that Cæſar’s&nbsp;funeral obſequies ſhould be performed ; which the ſenate now could not decently forbid, as they had never&nbsp;declared him a tyrant. Accordingly, the body was&nbsp;brought forth into the forum with the utmoſt ſolem-nity ; and Antony began his operations upon the paſſions of the people, by the prevailing motives of private intereſt. He firſt read Cæſar’s will, in which he&nbsp;had left Octavius, his fiſter’s grandſon, his heir, permitting him to take the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cæſar ;</span><span class="font0"> and three&nbsp;parts of his private fortune Brutus was to inherit in caſe&nbsp;of his death. The Roman people were left the gardens which he had on the other ſide the Tiber ; and&nbsp;every citizen, in particular, was to receive 300 ſeſter-ces. This laſt bequeſt not a little contributed to increaſe the people’s affection for their late dictator ; they&nbsp;now began to conſider Cæſar as a father, who, not ſa-tisfied with doing them the greateſt good while living,&nbsp;thought of benefiting them even after his death. As&nbsp;Antony, continued reading, the multitude began to&nbsp;be moved, and fighs and lamentations were heard&nbsp;from every quarter. Antony, ſeeing the audience fa-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
