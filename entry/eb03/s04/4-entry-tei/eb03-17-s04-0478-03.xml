(Italicus Caius), an ancient Roman poet, and author of an epic poem in 17 books, which contains an hiſtory of the ſecond Punic war, ſo famous for having decided the empire of the world in favour of the Romans. He was born in the reign of Tiberius, and is ſuppoſed to have derived the name of <hi rend="italic">Italicus</hi> from the place of his birth ; but whether he was born at Italica in Spain, or at Corfinium in Italy, which, according to Strabo, had the name of <hi rend="italic">Italica</hi> given it during the Social war, is a point which cannot be known : though, if his birth had happened at either oſ theſe places, the grammarians would tell us, that he ſhould have been called <hi rend="italic">Itallcenſis,</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">Italicus.</hi> When he came to Rome, he applied himſelf to the bar ; and, by a cloſe imitation of Cicero, ſucceeded ſo well, that he became a celebrated advocate and moſt accompliſhed orator. His merit and character recommended him to the highest offices in the republic, even to the conſulſhip, of which he was poſſessed when Nero died. He is said to have been aiding and aſſiſting in accuſing perſons of high rank and fortune, whom that wicked emperor had devoted to deſtruction : but he retrieved his character afterwards by a long and uniform courſe of virtuous behaviour. Veſpafian ſent him as proconſul into Asia, where he behaved with clean hands and unblemiſhed reputation. After having thus ſpent the beſt part of his life in the ſervice of his country, he bade adieu to public affairs, resolving to conſecrate the remainder to polite retirement and the muſes. He had ſeveral fine villas in the country : one at Tuſeulum, celebrated for having been Cicero’s ; and a farm near Naples ſaid to have been Virgil’s, at which was his tomb, which Silius often visited. Thus Martial compliments him on both theſe accounts .:</p><p><hi rend="italic">Silius haec magni celebrat monumenta Maronis,</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">jugera jucundi qui Ciceronis habet,</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Haeredem Dominumque sui tumulique lariſque</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Non alium mallet nec Maro nec Cicero.</hi></p><p>Epigr. 49. lib. xi.</p><p>Of Tully’s seat my Silius is possess'd,</p><p>And his the tomb where Virgil’s aſhes reſt.</p><p>Could thoſe great ſhades return to chooſe their heir,</p><p>The preſent owner they would both prefer.</p><p>In theſe retirements he applied himſelf to poetry : led not ſo much by any great force of genius, which would certainly not have ſuffered him to ſtay till life was in the wane and his imagination growing cold, as by his exceeding great love of Virgil, to whoſe memory Ire paid the higheſt veneration. He has imitated hint in his poem ; and though he falls infinitely ſhort of him, yet he has diſcovered a great and univerſal genius, which would have enabled him to ſucceed in ſome degree in whatever he undertook.</p><p>Having been for ſome time afflicted with an impoſthume, which was deemed incurable, he grew weary of life, to which, in the language of Pliny, he put an end with determined courage.</p><p>There have been many editions of Silius Italicus. A neat and correct one was publiſhed at Leipsic in 1696,in 8vo, with ſhort and uſeful notes by Cellarius: but the</p><p>beſt is that c <hi rend="italic">um rotis integris variorum et Arnοldi Drakenborch.</hi> Traject. ad Rhen. 1717, in 4to.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
