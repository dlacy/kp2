<p><span class="font0">tempting to ſet himſelf above the grand-maſter even in civil affairs, and to perſecute thoſe wſho adhered&quot; to the&nbsp;conſeſſion of Augſhurg, choſe for his coadjutor in the&nbsp;archbiſhopric of Riga Chriſtopher duke of Mecklenburg. From the abilities and haughty temper of this&nbsp;lord, the Livonian knights apprehended that they had&nbsp;reaſon to fear the ſame fate which had befallen the Teutonic order in Pruſſia ; and the ffep itſelf was, beſides,&nbsp;unprecedented, and contrary to the eſtabliſhed laws of&nbsp;the count!y. Theſe diſcontents were heightened by&nbsp;letters ſaid to be intercepted from the archbiſhop to his&nbsp;brother Albert duke of Pruſſia, inviting this laſt totally to ſuppreſs the order of Livonian knights, and&nbsp;to ſecularize their poſſeſſions, eſpecially in Finland ; ſo&nbsp;that an open war broke out among the contending parties, and the archbiſhop was ſeized and made priſoner.&nbsp;He was, however, ſoon releaſed through the mediation&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">the emperor of Germany and other potentates, backed by the powerful preparations of the Pruſſians to&nbsp;avenge his cauſe ; but in the mean time, the ſtrength&nbsp;of their country being totally exhauſted, the Livonians&nbsp;were obliged, inſtead of preparing for war, to ſue to the&nbsp;Czar ſor peace. Baſilovitz replied, that he did not&nbsp;believe their intentions to be ſincere while they kept&nbsp;6ooo Germans in pay ; and therefore, if they meant&nbsp;to treat of peace, they muſt begin with diſrniſſing theſe&nbsp;troops. The Livonians, having no longer any power&nbsp;to reſiſt, did as they were ordered ; but it availed them&nbsp;nothing. In 1558 an army of 100,000 Ruffians entered the diſtrict of Dorpt, and laid every thing waſte&nbsp;before them with the moſt ſhocking cruelty. Aſter&nbsp;this they entered the territories of Riga, where they&nbsp;behaved with equal inhumanity ; and ſhaving at laſt&nbsp;ſatiated themſelves with blood and treaſure, they retired with an immenſe booty and a great number of&nbsp;priſoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Livonians, now thoroughly convinced of their own folly in expofing themſelves to the reſentment of&nbsp;the exaſperated Ruffians, ſent ambaſſadors to ſue for&nbsp;peace in good earnel⅛. Theſe offered the Czar a preſent oſ 30,00Θ ducats, and prevailed upon him to grant&nbsp;their nation a truce for four months, during which they&nbsp;returned home to get the money. But in this interval&nbsp;the Livonian governor of the city of Nerva, out of an&nbsp;idle frolic, fired ſome cannon againſt Ivanogorod or&nbsp;Ruſſian Nerva, ſituated on the oppoſite fide of the river, and killed ſeveral of the Czar’s ſubjects who were&nbsp;aſſembled in an open place quite unarmed. The Ruffians, out of regard to the truce, did not even attempt&nbsp;to make repriſals ; but immediately acquainted Baſilovitz with what had happened : which ſo incenſed the&nbsp;Czar, that when the Livonian ambaſſadors arrived, he&nbsp;told them, he looked upon their nation to be a ſet of&nbsp;perjured wretches, who had renounced all honeſty; that&nbsp;they might go back with their money and propoſals,&nbsp;and let their countrymen know that his vengeance&nbsp;would ſoon overtake them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ambaſſadors were ſcarce arrived in Livonia, when an army of 300,000 Ruffians entered the diſtrict of Ner-va, under the command of Peter Siſegaledrii, who had&nbsp;been a famous pirate in the Euxi∏e ſea. He took the&nbsp;city of Nerva in nine days, and very ſpeedily made himſelf maſter oſ Dorpt, where he found immenſe treaſures.&nbsp;Several other garriſons, terrified by the approach of ſuch&nbsp;numbers, quitted their poſts ; ſo that the Ruffians became maſters of a great part of Livonia almoſt without&nbsp;oppoſition. At laſt, Gothard Kettler, grand-maſter </span><span class="font1">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the knights of Livonia, intreated Chriſtian III. king of&nbsp;Denmark to take Riga, Revel, and the countries of&nbsp;Garnland, Wirrland, and Eſthonia, under his protection ; but the advanced age of that monarch, the diſtance of the places, and the want of ſuſſicient power to&nbsp;withſtand ſo potent an adversary, made him decline the&nbsp;offer. However, he aſſiſted them with ſome money and&nbsp;powder, of which they ſtood greatly in need. Having&nbsp;then applied, without ſucceſs, firſt to the emperor of&nbsp;Germany, and then to the court of Sweden, Kettler&nbsp;put himſelf under the protection of the Poles, who had&nbsp;hitherto been ſuch formidable enemies to the Ruffians.&nbsp;In the mean time the latter purfued their conqueſts ;&nbsp;they took the city of Marienburg, laid waſte the diſtrict&nbsp;of Riga, deſtroyed Garnland, and penetrated to the very gates of Revel. Felin, in which was the beſt artillery of the whole country, became theirs by the treachery of its garriſon ; and here William of Furſtenberg&nbsp;the old grand-maſter was taken, and ended his days in&nbsp;a priſon at Moſcow. The diſtracted ſituation of the&nbsp;Livonian affairs now induced the biſhop of Oeſel to ſell&nbsp;his biſhopric to Ferdinand king of Denmark, who exchanged it with his brother Magnus for a part of Hol-ſtein. The diſtricts of Reval and Eſthonia put themſelves under the protection of Sweden ; and then the&nbsp;grand-maſter, finding himſelf deſerted on all ſides, ſup-preſſed the order of which he was the chief, and accepted of the duchy of Courland, which he held as a&nbsp;fief of the crown of Poland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Czar ſaw with pleaſure the diviſion of Livonia between the Swedes and Poles, which, he rightly judged,&nbsp;would produce quarrels between the two nations, and&nbsp;thus give him the fairer opportunity of ſeizing the&nbsp;whole to himſelf. Accordingly, in 1564, the Swedes&nbsp;offered him their aſſiſtance againſt the Poles ; but he,&nbsp;judging himſelf to be ſuſſiciently ſtrong without them,&nbsp;attacked the Poles with his own forces, and w<sup>,</sup>as twice&nbsp;defeated, which checked his farther operations in Livonia. In 1569 he entered into a treaty of commerce&nbsp;with England, captain Richard Chancellor having a&nbsp;ſhort time before diſeovered a paſſage to Archangel in&nbsp;Ruſſia through the White Sea, by which that empire&nbsp;Was likely to be ſupplied with foreign goods, without&nbsp;the aſſiſtance either of Poland or Livonia. To the&nbsp;diſcoverers of this new paſſage Baſilovitz granted many excluſive privileges ; and after the death of queen&nbsp;-Mary renewed the alliance with queen Elizabeth,&nbsp;and wſhich has been continued without interruption&nbsp;ever ſince.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the mean time, however, a prodigious army of Turks and 'Partais entered Muſcovy, with a deſign to&nbsp;ſubdue the whole country. But Zerebrinov, the Czar’s&nbsp;general, having attacked them in a defile,. put them to&nbsp;flight with ∙conliderable daughter. Then they retired&nbsp;towards the mouth of the Volga, where they expected&nbsp;a conſiderable reinforcement ; but being cloſely purſued&nbsp;by the Ruffians and Tartars in alliance with them, they&nbsp;were agai-n defeated and forced to fly towards Azov on&nbsp;the Black Sea. But when they came there, they found&nbsp;the city almoſt entirely ruined by the blowing up of a&nbsp;powder magazine. The Ruffians then attacked their&nbsp;ſhips there, took ſome, and ſunk the reſt ; by which&nbsp;means almoſt the whole army periſhed with hunger or&nbsp;the ſword of the enemy.</span></p><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font1">From this time the empire oſ Ruſſia became ſo for-</span></h2><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
