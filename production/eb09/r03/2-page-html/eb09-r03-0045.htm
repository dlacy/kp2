        <p><span class="font2">than those of the first four, but they describe something like a
                transformation of the Roman city and state.&nbsp;Under the rule of these latter
                kings the separate settlements are for the first time enclosed with a rampart
                of&nbsp;colossal size and extent.@@<sup>1 </sup>The low grounds are
                drained,&nbsp;and a forum and circus elaborately laid out; on the&nbsp;Capitoline
                Mount a temple is erected, the massive foundations of which were an object of wonder
                even to Pliny.@@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>To the same period are assigned the redivision of
                the city&nbsp;area into four new districts and the introduction of a&nbsp;new
                military system, The kings increase in power and&nbsp;surround themselves with new
                splendour. Abroad, too,&nbsp;Rome suddenly appears as a powerful state ruling far
                and&nbsp;wide over southern Etruria and Latium. These startling&nbsp;changes are,
                moreover, ascribed to kings of alien descent,&nbsp;who one and all ascend the throne
                in the teeth of established constitutional forms. Finally, with the
                expulsion&nbsp;of the last of them—the younger Tarquin—comes a&nbsp;sudden shrinkage
                of power. At the commencement of the&nbsp;republic Rome is once more a comparatively
                small state,&nbsp;with hostile and independent neighbours at her very&nbsp;doors. It
                is difficult to avoid the conviction that the&nbsp;true explanation of this
                phenomenon is to be found in the&nbsp;supposition that Rome during this period
                passed under&nbsp;the rule of powerful Etruscan lords.@@<sup>3 </sup>In the 7th and
                6th&nbsp;centuries </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;"
                >b.c.,</span><span class="font2"> and probably earlier still, the
                Etruscans&nbsp;appear as ruling widely outside the limits of Etruria&nbsp;proper.
                They were supreme in the valley of the Po until&nbsp;their power there was broken by
                the irruption of Celtic&nbsp;tribes from beyond the Alps, and while still masters
                of&nbsp;the plains of Lombardy they established themselves in&nbsp;the rich lowlands
                of Campania, where they held their&nbsp;ground until the capture of Capua by the
                Samnite highlanders in 423 </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font2"> It is on the face
                of it improbable&nbsp;that a power which had extended its sway from the Alps&nbsp;to
                the Tiber, and from the Liris to Surrentum, should&nbsp;have left untouched the
                intervening stretch of country&nbsp;between the Tiber and the Liris. Nor are we
                without&nbsp;evidence of Etruscan rule in Latium.@@<sup>4</sup> According
                to&nbsp;Dionysius there was a time when the Latins were known&nbsp;to the Greeks as
                Tyrrhenians, and Rome as a Tyrrhenian&nbsp;city.@@<sup>5 </sup>When JEneas landed in
                Italy the Latins were at&nbsp;feud with Turnus (Turrlienos? Dionys., i. 64) of
                Ardea,&nbsp;whose close ally is the ruthless Mezentius, prince of Caere,&nbsp;to
                whom the Latins had been forced to pay a tribute of&nbsp;wine.@@<sup>6 </sup>Cato
                declared the Volsci to have been once subject to Etruscan rule,@@<sup>7</sup> and
                Etruscan remains found at&nbsp;Velitrae,@@<sup>8</sup> as well as the second name of
                the Volscian&nbsp;Auxur, Tarracina (the city of Tarchon), tend to confirm&nbsp;his
                statement. Nearer still to Rome is Tusculum, with&nbsp;its significant name, and at
                Alba we hear of a prince&nbsp;Tap^e-rios,@@<sup>9 </sup>lawless and cruel like
                Mezentius, who consults&nbsp;the “ oracle of Tethys in Tyrrhenia.” Thus we find
                the&nbsp;Etruscan power encircling Rome on all sides, and in Rome&nbsp;itself a
                tradition of the rule of princes of Etruscan origin.&nbsp;The Tarquinii come from
                South Etruria; their name can&nbsp;hardly be anything else than the Latin equivalent
                of the&nbsp;Etruscan Tarchon, and is therefore possibly a title</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">(= “ lord ” or “ prince ”) rather than a proper name.@@<sup>10
                </sup>Even Servius Tullius Was identified by Tuscan chroniclers&nbsp;with an
                Etruscan “ Mastarna.”@@<sup>11</sup> Again, what we are told&nbsp;of Etruscan
                conquests does not represent them as moving,&nbsp;like the Sabellian tribes, in
                large bodies and settling down&nbsp;</span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">en masse</span><span class="font2"> in the conquered
                districts. We hear rather of&nbsp;military raids led by ambitious chiefs who carve
                out&nbsp;principalities for themselves with their own good swords,&nbsp;and with
                their followers rule oppressively over alien and&nbsp;subject
                    peoples.@@<sup>12</sup> And so at Rome the story of the&nbsp;Tarquins implies
                not a wave of Etruscan immigration&nbsp;so much as a rule of Etruscan princes over
                conquered&nbsp;Latins.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The achievements ascribed to the Tarquins are not less
                characteristic. Their despotic rule and splendour contrast&nbsp;with the primitive
                simplicity of the native kings. Only&nbsp;Etruscan builders, under the direction of
                wealthy and&nbsp;powerful Etruscan lords, could have built the great&nbsp;cloaca,
                the Servian wall, or the Capitoline temple,'—monuments which challenged comparison
                with those of the&nbsp;emperors themselves. Nor do the traces of Greek influence
                upon Rome during this period@@<sup>13</sup> conflict with the&nbsp;theory of an
                Etruscan supremacy; on the contrary, it is at&nbsp;least possible that it was thanks
                to the extended rule&nbsp;and wide connexions of her Etruscan rulers that
                Rome&nbsp;was first brought into direct contact with the Greeks, who&nbsp;had long
                traded with the Etruscan ports and influenced&nbsp;Etruscan
                culture.@@<sup>14</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">These Etruscan princes are represented, not only as having raised
                Rome for the time to a commanding position in Latium and lavished upon the city
                itself the resources of&nbsp;Etruscan civilization, but also as the authors of
                important&nbsp;internal changes. They are represented as favouring new&nbsp;men at
                the expense of the old patrician families, and as&nbsp;reorganizing the Roman army
                on a new footing, a policy&nbsp;natural enough in military princes of alien birth,
                and&nbsp;rendered possible by the additions which conquest had&nbsp;made to the
                original community. From among the leading families of the conquered Latin states a
                hundred new&nbsp;members were admitted to the senate, and these
                gentes&nbsp;thenceforth ranked as patrician, and became known as&nbsp;“ gentes
                    minores.”@@<sup>15</sup> The changes in the army begun, it is&nbsp;said, by the
                elder Tarquin and completed by Servius&nbsp;Tullius were more important. The basis
                of the primitive&nbsp;military system had been the three tribes, each of
                which&nbsp;furnished 1000 men to the legion and 100 to the
                    cavalry.@@<sup>16&nbsp;</sup>Tarquinius Priscus, we are told, contemplated the
                creation&nbsp;of three fresh tribes and three additional centuries of&nbsp;horsemen
                with new names,@@<sup>17 </sup>though in face of the opposition offered by the old
                families he contented himself with&nbsp;simply doubling the strength without
                altering the names&nbsp;of the old divisions.@@<sup>18</sup> But the change
