<p><span class="font1">The first edition of Regnard's works was published in 1731 (5 vols., Rouen and Paris). There is a good selection of almost everything important in the Collection Didot (4 vols., 1819), but there is no&nbsp;absolutely complete edition. The best is that published by Crapelet&nbsp;(6 vols., Paris, 1822). A selection by </span><span class="font2">L. </span><span class="font1">Moland appeared in 1893.&nbsp;See also a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bibliographie et iconographie des œuvres de J.

<p><span class="font2">REGNAULT, HENRI (1843-1871), French painter, born at Paris on the 31st October 1843, was the son of Henri Victor&nbsp;Regnault (ç.v.). On leaving school he successively entered the&nbsp;studios of Montfort, Lamothe and Cabanel, was beaten for the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Grand Prix</span><span class="font2"> (1863) by Layraud and Montchablon, and in 1864&nbsp;exhibited two portraits in no wise remarkable at the Salon.&nbsp;In 1866, however, he carried off the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Grand Prix</span><span class="font2"> with a work&nbsp;of unusual force and distinction—“ Thetis bringing the Arms&nbsp;forged by Vulcan to Achilles ” (School of the Fine Arts). The&nbsp;past in Italy did not touch him, but his illustrations to Wey’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rome</span><span class="font2"> show how observant he was of actual life and manners;&nbsp;even his “ Automedon ” (School of FineArts), executed in obedience to Academical regulations, was but a lively recollection of a&nbsp;carnival horse-race. At Rome, moreover, Regnault came into&nbsp;contact with the modern Hispano-ItaIian school, a school highly&nbsp;materialistic and inclined to regard even the human subject&nbsp;only as one amongst many sources whence to obtain amusement&nbsp;for the eye. The vital, if narrow, energy of this school told on&nbsp;RegnauIt with ever-increasing force during the few remaining&nbsp;years of his life. In 1868 he had sent to the Salon a life-size&nbsp;portrait of a lady in which he had made one of the first attempts&nbsp;to render the actual character of fashionable modern life. While&nbsp;making a tour in Spain, he saw Prim pass at the head of his troops,&nbsp;and received that lively image of a military demagogue which&nbsp;he afterwards put on canvas, somewhat to the displeasure of his&nbsp;subject. But this work made an appeal to the imagination&nbsp;of the public, whilst all the later productions of Regnault were&nbsp;addressed exclusively to the eye. After a further flight to&nbsp;Africa, abridged by the necessities of his position as a pensioner&nbsp;of the school of Rome, he painted “Judith,” then (1870) “ Salome/’&nbsp;and, as a work due from the Roman school, despatched from&nbsp;Tangier the large canvas, “ Execution without Hearing under&nbsp;the Moorish Kings,” in which the painter had played with the&nbsp;blood of the victim as if he were a jeweller toying with rubies.&nbsp;The war arose, and found Regnault foremost in the devoted&nbsp;ranks of Buzenval, where he fell on the 19th </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font2">January 1871.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">REGNAULT, HENRI VICTOR (1810-1878), French chemist and physicist, was born on the 21st of July 1810 at Aix-la-Chapellc. His early life was a struggle with poverty. When&nbsp;a boy he went to Paris and obtained a situation in a large&nbsp;drapery establishment, where he remained, occupying every&nbsp;spare hour in study, until he was in his twentieth year. Then&nbsp;he entered the École Polytechnique, and passed in 1832 to the&nbsp;École des Mines, where he developed an aptitude for experimental chemistry. A few years later he was appointed to a&nbsp;professorship of chemistry at Lyons. His most important contribution to organic chemistry was a series of researches, begun&nbsp;in 1835, on the haloid and other derivatives of unsaturated&nbsp;hydrocarbons. He also studied the alkaloids and organic&nbsp;acids, introduced a classification of the metals according to&nbsp;the facility with which they or their sulphides are oxidized&nbsp;by steam at high temperatures, and effected a comparison&nbsp;of the chemical composition of atmospheric air from all parts&nbsp;of the world. In 1840 he was recalled to Paris by his appointment to the chair of chemistry in the École Polytechnique; at the same time he was elected a member of the&nbsp;Académie des Sciences, in the chemical section, in room of&nbsp;P. J. Robiquet (1780-1840); and in the following year he became professor of physics in the College de France, there succeeding P. L. Dulong, his old master, and in many respects&nbsp;his model. From this time Regnault devoted almost all his&nbsp;attention to practical physics; but in 1847 he published a&nbsp;four-volume treatise on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chemistry</span><span class="font2"> which has been translated&nbsp;into many languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Regnault executed a careful redetermination of the specific heats of all the elements obtainable, and of many compounds—&nbsp;solids, liquids and gases. He investigated the expansibility&nbsp;of gases by heat, determining the coefficient for air as 0-003665,&nbsp;and showed that, contrary to previous opinion, no two gases&nbsp;had precisely the same rate of expansion. By numerous delicate&nbsp;experiments he proved that Boyle’s law is only approximately&nbsp;true, and that those gases which are most readily liquefied&nbsp;diverge most widely from obedience to it. He studied the whole&nbsp;subject of thermometry critically; he introduced the use of&nbsp;an accurate air-thermometer, and compared its indications&nbsp;with those of a mercurial thermometer, determining the absolute dilatation of mercury by heat as a step in the process.&nbsp;He also paid attention to hygrometry and devised a hygrometer&nbsp;in which a cooled metal surface is used for the deposition of&nbsp;moisture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1854 he was appointed to succeed J. J. Ebelmen (1814-1852) as director of the porcelain manufactory at Sèvres. He carried&nbsp;on his great research on the expansion of gases in the laboratory&nbsp;at Sèvres, but all the results of his latest work were destroyed&nbsp;during the Franco-German War, in which also his son Hcnri&nbsp;(noticed above) was killed. RegnauIt never recovered from the&nbsp;double blow, and, although he lived until the 19th of January&nbsp;1878, his scientific labours ended in 1872. He wrote more than&nbsp;eighty papers on scientific subjects, and he made important&nbsp;researches in conjunction with other workers. His greatest&nbsp;work, bearing on the practical treatment of steam-engines,&nbsp;forms vol. xxi. of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mémoires de l' Académie des Sciences,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REGNAULT, JEAN BAPTISTE (1754-1829), French painter, was born at Paris on the 9th of October 1754, and died in the&nbsp;same city on the 12th of November 1829. He began life at&nbsp;sea in a merchant vessel, but at the age of fifteen his talent&nbsp;attracted attention, and he was sent to Italy by M. de Monval&nbsp;under the care of Bardin. After his return to Paris, Regnault,&nbsp;in 1776, obtained the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Grand Prix<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font2">  and in 1783 he was elected&nbsp;Academician. His diploma picture, the “ Education of Achilles&nbsp;by Chiron,” is now in the Louvre, as also the “ Christ taken down&nbsp;from the Cross,” originally executed for the royal chapel at&nbsp;Fontainebleau, and two minor works—the “ Origin of Painting ”&nbsp;and “ Pygmalion praying Venus to give Life to his Statue.” Besides various small pictures and allegorical subjects, Regnault&nbsp;was also the author of many large historical paintings; and his&nbsp;school, which reckoned amongst its chief attendants Guérin,&nbsp;Crepin, Lafitte, BIondeI, Robert Lefevre and .Menjaud, was&nbsp;for a long while the rival in influence of that of David.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REGNAULT DE SAINT JEAN D’ANGÉLY, MICHEL LOUIS ÉTIENNE, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Comte</span><span class="font2"> (1761-1819), French politician, was born at&nbsp;Saint Fargcau (Yonne) on the 3rd of December 1761. Before the&nbsp;Revolution he was an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">avocat</span><span class="font2"> Paris and lieutenant of the maritime&nbsp;provostship of Rochefort. In 1789 he was elected deputy to the&nbsp;States General by the Third Estate of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sénéchaussée</span><span class="font2"> of Saint&nbsp;Jean d’Angély. His eloquence made him a prominent figure in&nbsp;the Constituent Assembly, where he boldly attacked Mirabeau,&nbsp;and settled the dispute about the ashes of Voltaire by decreeing&nbsp;that they belonged to the nation. But the moderation shown&nbsp;by the measures he proposed at the time of the flight of the&nbsp;king to Varennes, by his refusal to accede to the demands for&nbsp;the king’s execution, and by the articles he published in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Journal de Paris</span><span class="font2"> and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ami des patriotes,</span><span class="font2"> marked him out&nbsp;for the hostility of the advanced parties. He was arrested after&nbsp;the revolution of the 10th of August 1792, but succeeded in&nbsp;escaping, and during the reaction which followed the fall of&nbsp;Robespierre was appointed administrator of the military&nbsp;hospitals in Paris. His powers of organization brought him&nbsp;to Bonaparte’s notice, and he took part in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">coup d’étal</span><span class="font2"> of&nbsp;18 Brumaire, year VIII. (9th of November 1799). Under the&nbsp;Empire he enjoyed the confidence of Bonaparte, and was made&nbsp;councillor of state, president of section in the Council of State,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
