<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">judices on </span><span class="font2">the altar of their country. He concluded an animated addrefs with theſe words, “ Let all who hold&nbsp;in equal deteſtation a republic and two chambers, and&nbsp;who wiſh to maintain the conſtitution as it is, rife!”&nbsp;The words were ſcarcely pronounced when the whole&nbsp;aſſembly ſtarted from their feats. Men of all parties&nbsp;ſolemnly embraced each other, and proteſted their adherence to the conſtitution. A deputation announced&nbsp;this happy event to the king ; who immediately came&nbsp;and congratulated them in a ſhort ſpeech, which was&nbsp;leceived with infinite app’auſe. The only good effect,&nbsp;however, produced by this temporary agreement was,&nbsp;that the ſeſtival of the 14th of July, which was celebrated with the ufual magnificence, paſſed over in tranquillity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the 25th of July, the duke of Brunfwick iſſued at Coblentz his celebrated manifeſto. It declared the&nbsp;purpoſe of the intended invaſion of France to be the reſtoration of the French king to full authority. It de-clared the national guard of France reſponfible for the&nbsp;preſervation of tranquillity; and threatened with the pu-niſhment of death, as rebels to their king, thoſe who&nbsp;ſhould appear in arms againſt the allied powers. All&nbsp;men holding offices, civil or military, were threatened&nbsp;in the ſame manner, as well as the inhabitants of all cities. The city of Paris in particular, and the national&nbsp;aſſembly, were declared reſponſible for every inſult which&nbsp;might be offered to the royal family. It was declared,&nbsp;that if they were not immediately placed in ſafety, the&nbsp;allies were reſolved to inflict &quot; on thoſe who ſhould deſerve it the moſt exemplary and ever memorable avenging puniſhments, by giving up the city of Paris to military execution, and expoſing it to total deſtruction ;&nbsp;and the rebels who ſhould be guilty of illegal reſlſtance&nbsp;ſhould ſuffer the puniſhments which they ſhould have&nbsp;deſerved.” This ſanguinary and imprudent manifeſto&nbsp;operated as a warrant for the deſtruction of the unfortunate Louis XVI. It left no middle party in the na-tion. All who wiſhed to preferve freedom in any form,&nbsp;and all who loved the independence of their country,&nbsp;were inſtantly united. At the ſame time, the reproach-es caſt on the king by the Jacobins now gained univer-ſal credit. The kings of Pruffia and of Hungary told&nbsp;the French nation, that their monarch was ſecretly hof-tile to the conſtitution ; and the reſtoration of him and&nbsp;his family to deſpotic power was made the ſole pre-tence for a bloody and dangerous war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The republican party faw the advantage which they had now gained, and refolved upon the depoſition of&nbsp;the king. The chief engine which they meant to employ in this ſervice conſiſted of about 1500 men, who&nbsp;had come to Paris at the period of the confederation on&nbsp;the 14th of July, and therefore called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">faderes,</span><span class="font2"> and who&nbsp;were alfo fometimes denominated </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Marfiillms,</span><span class="font2"> from the&nbsp;place from which the greater number of them came.&nbsp;Next to theſe, dependence was placed in the populace&nbsp;of the ſuburbs of the capital. Thc deſigns of the republicans were not unknown to the court, and both&nbsp;parties were forming plans of operation. It is ſaid&nbsp;that the royal party intended that the king and his family ſhould fuddenly lea^e the capital, and proceed to&nbsp;as great a diſtance as the conſtitution permitted. The&nbsp;republicans are ſaid to have intended to ſeize the perfon&nbsp;of the king, and to confine him in the caſtle of Vin-cennes till a national convention ſhould decide upon his&nbsp;fate. Both allegations are probably true. Every motive&nbsp;which can influence the mind of man muſt have induced Louis to wiſh to be at a diſtance from the factious and&nbsp;ſanguinary capital. And the ſubſequent conduct of&nbsp;the republicans authoriſe us to believe them capable of&nbsp;the worſt crime that was laid to their charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Various charges had been brought forward in the affembly againſt La Fayette, and the 8th of Auguſt was appointed for their ducuffion. In the mean time, on&nbsp;the 3d of Auguſt, Petion the mayor, at the head of a&nbsp;deputation from the ſections of Paris, appeared at the&nbsp;bar, and in a ſolemn ſpeech demanded the depoſition of&nbsp;the king. The diſcuſlion of the accuſation againſt La&nbsp;Fayette was conſidered as a trial of ſtrength between&nbsp;the parties : he was acquitted, however, by a majority&nbsp;of nearly 200 ; and the republican party, deſpairing oſ&nbsp;carrying their point by a vote ©f the national aſſembly,&nbsp;•reſolved to have recourſe to infurrection and force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the evening of the 9th of Auguſt, about 1500 gentlemen, officers of the army, and others, repaired to&nbsp;the palace, reſolved to protect the royal family or to&nbsp;die in their defence : added to thefe were 70© Swifs&nbsp;guards, with a body of cavalry amounting to about&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font2">ooo. Mandat, the commander of the national guards,&nbsp;a man who was firmly attached to the conſtitution, had&nbsp;procured 2400 of that body and 12 pieces of cannon,&nbsp;with ſuch a force, it has been generally thought that,&nbsp;by vigorous and ſteady councils, the palace, which is a&nbsp;kind of caſtle, might have been ſucceſsfully defended ;&nbsp;and what is now called a revolution might have born&nbsp;the name of a rebellion. Meanwhile the aſſembly de-clared its fittings permanent. Petion was at the palace&nbsp;late on the evening of the 9th. Some apprehenſions&nbsp;were entertained, or pretended tobe entertained, forhia&nbsp;ſafety (for the whole of this buſineſs was, on the part&nbsp;of the republicans, the moſt infernal plot), and a deputation from the aſſembly brought him away. At mid-night the toçlin or alarm bell was founded, and thc&nbsp;drums beat to arms through the city. At this inſtant&nbsp;a number of the moſt active leaders of the republican&nbsp;party aſſembled, and elected a new common council or&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">commune.</span><span class="font2"> The perſons thus irregularly choſen inſſantly&nbsp;took poſſeffion of the common hall, and drove out tlie&nbsp;lawful members ; who, with that weakneſs with wliich&nbsp;men are apt to ſhrink from ſtations of reſponſibility in pe-rilous times, readily gave place to tlie uſurpers. The new&nbsp;commune ſent repeated meſſages to M. Mandat, requiring liis attendance upon important buſineſs. He was&nbsp;occupied in arranging the troops in the beft order a-round tlie palace ; but ſuſpecting nothing, he went to&nbsp;the common Lall, and was there aſtoniſhed to ſind a different affembly from what he expected. He was a-bruptly accuſed of a plot to maffacre the people, and&nbsp;ordered to priſon ; but as he deſeended tbe ſtairs, lie&nbsp;was ſhot with a piſtol, and Santerre was appointed in&nbsp;his ſtead to command the national guard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On this eventful night no perfon in the palace went to bed. About ſix o’clock in the morning of the 10th&nbsp;the king deſeended into the gardens to review tlie&nbsp;troops. He was received with ſhouts of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vive le roi</span><span class="font2"> excepting from the artillery, who ſhouted </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vive la nation.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">The king returned to the palace, and the multitude&nbsp;continued to collect.
