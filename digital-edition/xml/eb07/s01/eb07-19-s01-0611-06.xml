or <hi rend="smallcaps">Ganga Sagor,</hi> an island belonging to the province of Bengal, situatcd at the entrance and eastern side of the Hooghly, or Bhagurutty river, which here separates it from another island formed by the numerous outlets of the Ganges.

in breadth, and is detached from the mainland by a creek, the north end of which is dry at low water. The spring-</p><p>tides rise here to the height of four fathoms. This station is found more healthy for ships than those farther up the Hooghly. This is owing to the great expansion of the river, in consequence of which, ships have the advantage of lying at a greater distance from the shore, and of enjoying a refreshing circulation of sea-air; and they also escape the offensive exhalations from the mud banks at Culpee and Diamond Harbour.</p><p>Sagor island has been from time immemorial a celebrated place of pilgrimage among the Hindus, being situated at the junction of the Bhogurutty river, or most sacred branch of the Ganges, with the ocean. Many of the pilgrims formerly made voluntary sacrifices of themselves, and sometimes of their children, to the sacred sharks and alligators inhabiting the surrounding waters. But in 1812 the practice was abolished under the administration of the Marquis Wellesley. The jungles of this island swarm with tigers of the largest and most ferocious sort. The island is not inhabited ; but the Brahmins repair at the appointed season to the temple, and are followed by pilgrims. Its south point is in long. 88. 20. E. and lat. 21. 34.
