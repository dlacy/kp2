The Palazzo Nuovo di Torlonia, the residence of Torlonia the Roman banker, who has purchased the title and estate of the Duca di Bracciano, is fitted up with all the magnificence that wealth can command. The gallery is adorned with Canova’s colossal group of Hercules and Lychas. The Farnese palace contains the far-famed gallery painted in fresco by Annibal Caracci.</p><p>The Vatican has long been celebrated for its unrivalled splendour and magnificence. Its ceilings richly painted in fresco ; its pictured pavements of ancient mosaic ; its magnificent gates of bronze ; its polished columns of ancient porphyry, the splendid spoils of the mins of imperial Rome ; its endless accumulation of Grecian marble, Egyptian granites, and Oriental alabasters; its bewildering extent and prodigality of magnificence; but, above all, its amazing treasures of sculpture, far surpass even the gorgeous dreams of Eastern magnificence.@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi> In common with all the other collections of the fine arts in Rome, the Vatican suffered materially from the rapacity of the French, but on the downfall of Bonaparte the stolen treasures were restored to their rightful owners. The Vatican contains a museum filled with the most splendid specimens of ancient sculpture;—the tapestry chambers hung with tapestry woven in the looms of Flanders, and copied from the cartoons of Raphael ;—a picture gallery, filled with the masterpieces of painting ;—the<hi rend="italic">Camere </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Loggie</hi>  of Raphael, painted in fresco by himself and his pupils ;—the Sistina and Paolina chapels, painted in fresco by Michael Angelo ;—and the library, the halls and galleries of which alone are more than thirteen hundred feet in length. The view from the balcony in front of the windows gave the name of <hi rend="italic">Belvidere</hi>  to the museum, and in consequence to the matchless statue of Apollo Belvidere, pronounced by universal consent to be the finest statue in the world. It was found near Antium, in the ruins of a Roman villa, supposed to have originally belonged to Nero. The name of its artist is unknown. Here, also, is the celebrated group of the Laocoon, which Pliny states to have been executed by Agesander the Rhodian, and Athenodorus and Polidorus, who are believed to have been his sons.@@<hi rend="sup">2</hi>  This wonderful masterpiece was found in the palace of Titus, on the very spot where it is described by Pliny to have stood, and every successive generation that has passed since it was formed, has gazed with admiration on its matchless sublimity. The Vatican also contains the two finest paintings in the world, the Transfiguration by Raphael, and Domenichino’s Communion of St. Jerome. The library contains a splendid collection of books, and is peculiarly rich in rare and valuable manuscripts. But a minute account of the immense treasures of art accumulated in this magnificent building would occupy too much of our space.</p><p>Another of the Pope’s palaces, the Lateran, has been converted into an hospital.</p><p>The museum of the Capitol contains a very extensive collection of specimens of ancient sculpture. The finest works in it are the famous statue called the Dying Gladiator, found at Antium in the same spot with the Apollo Belvidere and the Fighting Gladiator; the two Furietti Centaurs; the old shrivelled crone, which some have called the Præfica, others a Sybil, others Hecuba ; the group of Cupid and Psyche ; Cupid bending his bow ; the Osiris and Isis ; the professor of the gymnastic art ; the noble seated statue of Agrippina, the wife of Germanicus ; the Camillus ; the child playing with a swan ; the bronze urn which bears the name of Mithridates ; the four doves, a mosaic, which must be either the original or a copy of the famous mosaic of Sosus, in the</p><lb/><p>temple of Pergamus, described by Pliny ; and the bas-reliefs of the dispute between Agamemnon and Achilles ; the Nine Muses ; and the battle of the Amazons.@@<hi rend="sup">3</hi> The Capitol contains also a museum of painting, but it is of very inferior interest.</p><p>The academy of St. Luke, in the Forum, contains Raphael’s famous picture of St. Luke painting the Virgin’s portrait. Here is preserved the skull of Raphael under a glass case.</p><p>Rome contains eleven public libraries, some of which are excellent. In the Augustine convent there is one containing upwards of one hundred thousand volumes, which is open to the public.</p><p>There are a great many villas in the immediate vicinity of Rome, and even within its walls. Every villa has at least one building, called a casino, containing a suite of entertaining rooms, fitted up with all the luxury of painting and sculpture. The villa and garden of the Borghese, which are by far the most beautiful pleasure grounds at Rome, arc open as a common drive to the whole metropolis. The villa Lu-dovisi, within the walls of the city, is nearly two miles in circuit. It contains an invaluable collection of celebrated pieces of ancient statuary, of which no copies are known to exist. The magnificent villa Medici, on the Pincian hill, is now converted into the French academy, where a number of young artists of promise are supported at the charge of the French government, with the view of enabling them to enjoy the advantages of a few years study at Rome. The villa Albani is enriched with the most precious collection of ancient sculpture that any private cabinet ever contained. The finest specimens of this collection are the famous Apollo <hi rend="italic">Sauroctonos,</hi>  the most beautiful bronze statue now left in the world, and which, in tlle judgment of Winkelman, is the original of Praxiteles, described by Pliny; the statue of Minerva, which is pronounced by Winkelman to be the only monument now existing at Rome of the sublime age of art that lasted from the age of Phidias to that of Praxiteles ; and the far-famed relievo of Antinous, which, says’ Winkelman, “ after the Apollo and the Laocoon, is perhaps the most beautiful monument of antiquity which time has transmitted to us.”@@<hi rend="sup">4</hi></p><p>The castle of St. Angelo, “ the mole which Hadrian rear’d on high,” was originally called “ Moles Adriani,” from the name of its founder, who destined it to hold his remains for ever. It is a circular building, and was formerly reckoned very strong ; it has stood many sieges, but as a fortress it is wholly untenable against modern tactics. It has been so often taken and retaken, repaired and altered, that but little of the original structure now remains, except the walls. It communicates with the Vatican by a long covered gallery, made by Pope Alexander VI., to afford him a way of escape from the just fury of his subjects. The castle of St. Angelo is now used as a place of confinement for prisoners sentenced to the galleys. The upper part of it also serves as a state prison fbr criminals of rank, and those who fall under the suspicion and displeasure of the Pope.</p><p>The population of Rome, which in 1800 amounted to 153,004, gradually diminished till it was only 117,882 in 1813. Since that period, however, it has progressively increased, and in 1836 consisted of 153,678, exclusive of Jews, who amount to 3700. On the dismemberment of the Pontifical territory in 1800, the population of those parts which now form the government was 2,400,000, in 1829 that population had increased to 2,679,524, being an augmentation of about one-eighth.</p><p>The population returns for the city of Rome in 1836, are thus given by the authorities ;—</p><lb/><p>@@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>  Rome in 19th Century, vol. i. p. 144—178.    </p><p>@@@<hi rend="sup">2</hi>  Pliny, lib. xxxiv. cap. 8.</p><p>@@@<hi rend="sup">3</hi>  Rome in 19th Century,· vol. ii. p. 428—450.
