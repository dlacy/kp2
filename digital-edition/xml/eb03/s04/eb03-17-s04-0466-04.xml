or <hi rend="smallcaps">tou-fans,</hi> a people inhabiting the country on the west of China. Their country is only a continued ridge of mountains, incloſed by the rivers Hoang-ho on the north, Ya-long on the weft, and Yang-tfe kiang on the eaſt, between the 30th and 35th degrees of north latitude.</p><p>The Si-fans are divided into two kinds of people ; the one are called by the Chineſe <hi rend="italic">Black Siſans,</hi> the other <hi rend="italic">Tellow ;</hi> names which are given them from the different colours of their tents. The black are the moſt clowniſh and wretched ; they live in ſmall bodies, and are governed by petty chiefs, who all depend upon a greater.</p><p>The yellow Si-fans are ſubject to families, the oldeſt of which becomes a lama, and aſſumes the yellow dreſs. Theſe lama princes, who command in their respective districts, have the power of trying cauſes, and puniſhing criminals ; but their government is by no means burdenſome ; provided certain honours are paid them, and they receive punctually the dues of the god Fo, which amount to very little, they moleſt none of their ſubjects. The greater part of the Si-fans live in tents; but ſome oſ them have houſes built of earth, and even brick. Their habitations are not contiguous ; they form at moſt but ſome ſmall hamlets, consisting of five or six ſamilies. They feed a great number of flocks, and are in no want of any of the neceſſaries of life. The principal article of their trade is rhubarb, which their country produces in great abundance. Their horſes are ſmall ; but they are well ſhaped, lively, and robuſt.</p><p>Theſe people are of a proud and independent ſpirit, and acknowledge with reluctance the ſuperiority of the Chineſe government, to which they have been ſubjected : when they are ſummoned by the mandarins, they rarely appear ; but the government, for political reaſons,<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0473.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0467"/>
winks at this contempt, and endeavours to keep theſe intractable ſubjects under by mildneſs and moderation : it would, beſides, be difficult to employ rigorous means in order to reduce them to perfect obedience ; their wild and frightful mountains (the tops of which are always covered with ſnow, even in the month of July) would afford them places of ſhelter, from which they could never be driven by force.</p><p>The cuſtoms of theſe mountaineers are totally different from those of the Chineſe. It is, for example, an act of great politeneſs among them to preſent a white handkerchief of taffety or linen, when they accoſt any perſon whom they are deſirous of honouring. All their religion conſiſts in their adoration of the god Fo, to whom they have a ſingular attachment: their ſuperstitious veneration extends even to his miniſters, on whom they have conſidered it as their duty to confer ſupreme power and the government of the nation.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
