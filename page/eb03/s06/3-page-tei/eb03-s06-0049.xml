It promiſes, however, to be applicable to other uſes, and to approach in virtue, as in fragrance, to ſtorax and balſam of Tolu. It is ſaid to be of great ſervice in diſorders of the breaſt, for reſolving obſtructions of the pulmonary vesſels, and promoting expectoration : in which intentions the flowers are ſometimes given, from three or four grains to fifteen. The white powder, precipitated by water from ſolutions of the benzoin in ſpirit, has been employed by ſome as ſimilar and ſuperior to the flowers, but appears to be little other than the pure benzoin in ſubſtance ; it is not the ſaline, but the reſinous matter of the benzoin, that is moſt diſpoſed to be precipitated from ſpirit by water. The flowers, ſnuffed up the noſe, are ſaid to be a powerful errhine.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Liquid storax</hi> is a reſinous juice obtained from a tree called by Linnæus <hi rend="italic">liquidambar styraciflua,</hi> a native of Virginia and Mexico, and lately naturalized in this country. The juice called liquidambar is ſaid to exude from inciſions made in the trunk of this tree, and the liquid ſtorax to be obtained by boiling the bark or branches in water. Two sorts of liquid ſtorax are diſtinguished by authors ; one, the purer part of the reſinous matter that riſes to the ſurface in boiling, separated by a ſtrainer, of the consiſtence of honey, tenacious like turpentine, of a reddiſh or aſh brown colour, moderately tranſparent, of an acrid unctuous taſte, and a fragrant ſmell, faintly reſembling that of the ſolid ſtorax, but ſomewhat diſagreeable: the other, the more impure part, which remains on the ſtrainer, is not tranſparent, in ſmell and taſte is much weaker, and contains a conſiderable proportion of the ſubſtance of the bark. What is moſt commonly met with under this name in the shops is of a weak ſmell and a grey colour, and is ſuppoſed to be an artificial compoſition.</p><p>Liquid ſtorax has been employed chiefly in external applications. Among us, it is at preſent almoſt wholly in diſuſe.</p><p>STYX (fab. hiſt. ), a celebrated river of hell, round which it flows nine times. The gods held the waters of the Styx in ſuch veneration, that to swear by them was reckoned an oath altogether inviolable. If any of the gods had perjured themselves, Jupiter obliged them to drink the waters of the Styx, which lulled them for one whole year into a ſenſeleſs ſtupidity, for the nine following years they were deprived of the ambroſia and the nectar of the gods, and after the expiration of the years of their puniſhment, they were reſtored to the aſſembly of the deities, and to all their original privileges. It is ſaid that this veneration was ſhown to the Styx, becauſe it received its name from the nymph Styx, who with her three daughters aſſiſted Jupiter in his war againſt the Titans.</p><p>Styx was a river which it was necessary for departed ſhades to paſs before they could enter the infernal regions ;@@ and it was the office of Charon to ferry them over in a boat which was kept for that purpoſe. The ghoſts of thoſe who had not been honoured with the rites of ſepulture were obliged to wander an hundred years before Charon could admit them into his boat to convey them before the judges of Hades. What could have given rise to this fable of Charon and his boat, it is not very material to inquire. Mythological writers have ſaid, that the Greeks learned it from the Egyptians, which is indeed probable enough ; that the Egyptians framed both this, and ſome other fables relating to the dead, from certain cuſtoms peculiar to their country ; that in particular there was, not far from Memphis, a famous burying-place, to which the dead bodies were conveyed in a boat across the lake Acherusia ; and that Charon was a boatman who had long officiated in that ſervice. The learned Dr Blackwell ſays, in his life of Homer, that, in the old Egyptian language, <hi rend="italic">Charoni</hi> ſignified “ ferryman.”</p><p>SUABIA, a circle of Germany, bounded on the north by the circle of Franconia and that of the Lower Rhine ; on the west by the circle of the Lower Rhine and Alſace ; on the ſouth by Switzerland ; and on the eaſt by the circle of Bavaria. Of all the circles of the empire, Suabia is the moſt divided ; it contains four eccleſiaſtic and thirteen lay principalities, nineteen independent prelacies and abbeys, twenty-six earldoms and lordships, and thirty-one tree cities. The prime directors of the circle, as they are termed, are the biſhop of Constance and the duke of Wirtemberg. The duke has the ſole direction of all that relates to war.</p><p>The mixture of the various forms of government and religious ſects ; the oppreſſion exerciſed by the great on the poor ; the game conſtantly played by the emperor, who poſseſſes many pieces of detached country in Suabia, which depend not on the circle, and can, in conſequence of his privileges as archduke of Auſtria, extend his posſeſſions in it by various ways; are circumſtances (ſays baron Rſeſheck@@) which give the cultivation of the country, and the character of the inhabitants, a moſt extraordinary caſt. In ſeveral of the poſt towns where you stop, you ſee the higheſt degree of cultivation in the midſt of the moſt savage wildneſs ; a great degree of knowledge and poliſh of manners, mixed with the grosseſt ignorance and ſuperſtition ; traces of liberty, under the deepeſt oppreſſion ; national pride, together with the contempt and neglect of the native country ; in ſhort, all the ſocial qualities in ſtriking contraſt and oppoſition to each other. Thoſe parts of Suabia which belong to the great potentates, ſuch as Wirtemberg, Auſtria, and Baden, are certainly the moſt improved. The whole of Suabia may comprehend about nine hundred German ſquare miles, and two millions of people. More than half of theſe are ſubjects of the three above mentioned princes, though they are not proprietors of near one half of the lands.</p><p>SUARES (Francis), a Jeſuit, was born in Granada on the 5th of January 1548. He was a professor of theology at Alcala, Salamanca, Rome, and Coimbra in Portugal. He died at Liſhon in 1617 with the greateſt reſignation ; “ I never thought (said he) that it was ſo eaſy to die.” His memory was aſtoniſhing, he could repeat the whole of his voluminous works by heart. His writings fill 23 folio volumes, and are moſtly on theological and moral ſubjects. His Treatiſe of Laws has been reprinted in this country. His Defence of the Catholic Faith againſt the Errors of England was written at the requeſt of pope Paul V. This book was publicly burnt at London by order of James I. When Suares heard it, he is ſaid to have exclaimed, “ O that I too could ſeal with my blood the truths which I have defended with my pen !”</p><p>SUBAH, the general name of the vſeeroyſhips, or greater governments, into which the Mogul empire was divided, consiſting of ſeveral provinces. The jurisdiction of a ſubahdar, the ſame as subahſhip, ſubaedaree, or nizamut.</p><p>SUBAHDAR, the viceroy, lord-lieutenant, or governor, holding a ſubah ; the lame as nabob or nazim. Alſo the black commander of a company of Seapoys.</p><p>SUBALTERN, a ſubordinate officer, or one who diſcharges his poſt under the command and ſubject to the direction of another; ſuch are lieutenants, ſub-lieutenants, cornets, and enſigns, who ſerve under the captain.</p><p>SUBCLAVIAN, in anatomy, is applied to any thing under the arm-pit or ſhoulder, whether artery, nerve, vein, or muſcle.</p><p>@@@[mu] Trans. of the R.
