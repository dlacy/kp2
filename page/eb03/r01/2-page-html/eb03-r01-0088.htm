And hereupon we may&nbsp;obſerve, that when a man has in himſelf the poſſeſſion&nbsp;of lands, he muſt at the common law convey the free-hold by feoffment and livery ; which makes a noto-riεty in the country : but if a man has only a right or&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">future intereſt, he may convey that right or intereſt&nbsp;by a mere releaſe to him that is in poſſeſſion of the&nbsp;land : for the occupancy of the releſſee is a matter of&nbsp;lufficient notoriety already.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RELEVANCY, in Scots law. See </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Law,</span><span class="font2"> N<sup>o </sup>clxxxvi. 48.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RELICS, in the Romiſh church, the remains of the bodies or clothes of ſaints or martyrs, and the in-ſtruments by which they were put to death, devoutly&nbsp;preſerved, in honour to their memory ; kiſſed, revered,&nbsp;and carried in proceſſion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The reſpect which was juſtly due to the martyrs and teachers of the Chriſtian faith, in a few ages increaſed&nbsp;almoſt to adoration ; and at length adoration was really&nbsp;paid both to departed ſaints and to relics of holy men&nbsp;or holy things.. The abuſes of the church of Rome,&nbsp;with reſpect to relics, are very flagrant and notorious.&nbsp;For ſuch was the rage for them at one time, that, as&nbsp;F. Mabillon a Benedictine juſtly complains, the altars&nbsp;were loaded with ſuſpected relics ; numerous ſpurious&nbsp;ones being everywhere offered to the piety and devotion of the faithful. He adds, too, that bones are of</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ten </span><span class="font2">conſecrated, which, ſo far from belonging to ſaints,&nbsp;probably do not belong to Chriſtians. From the cata</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">combs numerous relics have been taken,, and yet it is</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">not known who were the perſons interred therein. In the nth century, relics were tried by fire, and thofe&nbsp;which did not conſume were reckoned genuine, and&nbsp;the reſt not. Relics were, and ſtill are, preſerved on&nbsp;the altars whereon maſs is celebrated ; a ſquare hole being made in the middle of the altar, big enough to re-ceive the hand, and herein is the relic depoſited, be-ing firſt wrapped in red ſilk, and incloſed in a leaden&nbsp;box.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Romaniſts plead antiquity in behalf of relics : For the Manichees, out of hatred to the fleſh, which&nbsp;they conſidered as an evil principle, refuſed to,honour&nbsp;the relics of ſaints ; which is reckoned a kind of proof&nbsp;that the Catholics did it in thc firſt ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">we know, indeed, that the touching of linen cloths on relics, from an opinion of ſome extraordinary virtue&nbsp;derived therefrom, was as ancient as th¢ firſt ages, there&nbsp;being a hole made in the coffins of the 40 martyrs at&nbsp;Conſtantinople expreſsly for this purpoſe. The honouring the relics of ſaints, on which the church of&nbsp;Rome afterwards founded her ſuperſtitious and lucrative&nbsp;uſe of them, as objects of devotion, as a kind of charms&nbsp;or amulets, and as inſtruments of pretended miracles,&nbsp;appears to have originated in a very ancient cuſtom,&nbsp;that prevailed among Chriſtians, of affembling at the&nbsp;cemeteries or burying-places of the martyrs, for the&nbsp;purpoſe of commemorating them, and of performing&nbsp;divine worſhip. when the profeffion of Chriſtianity&nbsp;obtained the protection of the civil government, under&nbsp;Conſtantine the Great, ſtately churches were erected&nbsp;over their ſepulchres, and their names and memories&nbsp;were treated with every poffible token of affection and&nbsp;reſpect. This reverence, however, gradually exceeded&nbsp;all reaſonable bounds ; and thoſe prayers and religious&nbsp;ſervices were thought to have a peculiar ſanctity and&nbsp;virtue, which were performed over their tombs. Hence&nbsp;the practice which afterwards obtained, of depofiting&nbsp;relics of ſaints and martyrs under the altars in all&nbsp;churches. This practice was then thought of ſuch&nbsp;importance, that St Ambroſe would not conſecrate a-church becauſe it had no relics ; and the council of&nbsp;Conſtantinople in Trullo ordained, that thoſe altars·&nbsp;ſhonld be demoliſhed under which there were found no&nbsp;relics. The rage of procuring relics for this and other&nbsp;purpoſes of a ſimilar nature, became ſo exceffive, that&nbsp;in 386 the emperor Theodofius the Great was obliged&nbsp;to paſs a law, forbidding the pcople to dig up the bo-dies of the martyrs, and to traffic in their relics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Such was the origin of that reſpect for ſacred relics», which afterwards was perverted into a formal worſhip&nbsp;of them, and became the occafion of innumerable pro-ceffions, pilgrimages, and miracles, from which the&nbsp;church of Rome hath derived incredible advantage.—&nbsp;In the end of the ninth century, it was not ſufficient to&nbsp;reverence departed ſaints, and to confide in their inter-ceffions and ſuccours, to clothe them with an imaginary&nbsp;power of healing diſeaſes, working miracles, and delivering from all forts of calamities and dangers ; their&nbsp;bones, their clothes, the apparel and furniture they had&nbsp;poffeffed during their lives, the very ground which they&nbsp;had touched, or in which their putrified carcaſes were&nbsp;laid, were treated with a ſtupid veneration, and ſuppoſed to retain the marvellous virtue of healing all diſorders&nbsp;both of body and mind, and of defending ſuch as pof-</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ſeffed them againſt all the aſſaults and devices of </span><span class="font2">the de-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
