a genetical name given by Mr Latham to a bird of which hitherto but one ſpecies has been obſerved. It is about the ſize of a crow, and two feet three inches in length. The bill is large, convex, furrowed on the ſides, and bent at the tip; the noſtrils are placed at the baſe of it, and the tongue is cloven at the end. The general colour of the plumage is a browniſh aſh, but the tip of each feather of the back, wings, and tail, is black. The tail has each feather banded with black at the end, and the tip itſelf white; but the inner webs of the feather are marked with black and white bands. The toes are placed two forwards and two backwards, as in the parrot genus. This curious bird is a native of New Holland, and we believe in that part of the world is not uncommon, but its manners are as yet quite unknown. We are happy in being able to preſent our readers with an engraving of it from an excellent drawing with which we were lately favoured. See plate CCCCXLIX.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
