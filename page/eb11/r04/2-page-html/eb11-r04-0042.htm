                to be&nbsp;unjustifiably enriched at another’s cost; the jurists of the

                a&nbsp;key to the solution of many a difficult question in the domain of&nbsp;the

        <p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Influence of Constitutional
                Changes.</span><span class="font4">—The changes in the constitution aided not a
                little the current of the law. Men of foreign descent reached the throne and
                recruited the senate, sometimes proud indeed of the history and traditions of
                Rome,&nbsp;yet in most cases free from prejudice in favour of institutions that had
                nothing to recommend them but their antiquity. Military life, for obvious reasons,
                had not the same&nbsp;attractions as during the Republic; there was no longer a
                tribunate to which men of ambition might aspire; the </span><span class="font4"
                style="font-style:italic;">comitia</span><span class="font4"> soon&nbsp;ceased to
                afford an outlet for public eloquence; so that men of&nbsp;education and position
                had all the more inducement to devote&nbsp;themselves to the conscientious study and
                regular practice of the&nbsp;law. This was greatly encouraged by the aetion of
                Augustus&nbsp;in creating a class of, so to say, patented jurists privileged to
                give&nbsp;answers </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ex
                auctoritate principis</span><span class="font4"> to questions submitted to
                them&nbsp;by the magistrates ana judges. It was still more so perhaps
                by&nbsp;Hadrian’s reorganization of the imperial privy council, wherein a&nbsp;large
                proportion of the seats were assigned to jurists of distinction.&nbsp;Several of
                the, emperors had lawyers amongst their most intimate&nbsp;and trusted friends.
                Again and again the office of praetorian prefect, the highest next the throne, was
                filled by them; Papinian,&nbsp;Ulpian and Paul all held it in their time.
                Jurisprudence, therefore, was not merely an honourable and lucrative
                profession&nbsp;under the new arrangements, but a passport to places of
                eminence&nbsp;in the state; and till the death of Alexander the ranks of
            the</span></p>

                Roman&nbsp;citizens, so that the great mass of the provincials escaped it.
                Caracalla, being needy, not only increased it temporarily to 10%, but&nbsp;widened
                the area, of its operation by elevating all his free subjects&nbsp;to, the rank of

                Besides various measures for the amendment of the criminal law, &amp;c., there were
                three sets of enactments of considerable importance which owed their
                authorship&nbsp;to him: the first to improve domestic morality and encourage
                fruitful&nbsp;marriage, the second to abate the evils that had arisen from the
                too&nbsp;lavish admission of liberated slaves to the privileges of
                citizenship,&nbsp;and the third to regulate procedure in public prosecutions and
                private&nbsp;litigations.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font4">The first set included the </span><span class="font4"

                of&nbsp;Juvenal and others raises doubts whether the law did not really&nbsp;do more
