                <p><label>SALTYKOV (STCHEDRIN), MICHAEL EVGRAFOVICH</label> (1826-(1889), Russian
                    satirist, was born on his father’s estate in the province of Tula, 15th (27th)
                    January 1826. His early education was completely neglected, and his youth, owing
                    to the severity and the domestic quarrels of his parents, was full of the most
                    melancholy experiences. Left entirely to himself, he developed a love for
                    reading; but the only book in his father’s house was the Bible, which he studied
                    with deep attention. At ten years of age he entered the Moscow Institute for the
                    sons of the nobility, and subsequently the Lyceum at St Petersburg, where Prince
                    Lobánov Rostofski, afterwards minister for foreign affairs, was one of his
                    schoolfellows. While there he published poetry, and translations of some of the
                    works of Byron and Heine; and on leaving the Lyceum he obtained employment as a
                    clerk in the Ministry of War. In 1884 he published <hi rend="italic">Zaputennoye
                        Dyelo</hi> (“ A Complicated Affair ”), which, in view of the revolutionary
                    movements at that time in France and Germany, was the cause of his banishment to
                    Vyatka, where he spent eight years as a minor government officiai. This
                    experience enabled him to study the life and habits of civil servants in the
                    interior, and to give a clever picture of Russian provincial officials in his
                        <hi rend="italic">Gubernskie Otcherki</hi> (“ Provincial Sketches ”). On his
                    return to St Peters-burg as he was quickly promoted to administrative posts of
                    con-siderable importance. After making a report on the condition of the Russian
                    police, he was appointed deputy governor, first of Ryazan and then of Tver. His
                    predilection for literary work induced him to leave the government service, but
                    pecuniary difficulties soon compelled him to re-enter it, and in 1864 he was
                    appointed president of the local boards of taxation successively at Penza, Tula
                    and Ryazan. In 1868 he finally quitted the civil service. Subsequently he wrote
                    his principal works, namely, <hi rend="italic">Poshekhonskaya Starina</hi> (“
                    The Old Times of Poshek-hona ”), which possesses a certain autobiographical
                    interest; <hi rend="italic">Istοria odnavo Goroda</hi> (“ The History of a Town
                    ”); A Satirical History of Russia; <hi rend="italic">Messieurs et Mesdames
                        Pompadours;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Messieurs Golovloff.</hi> At one
                    time, after the death of the poet Nekrasov, he acted as editor of a leading
                    Russian magazine, the <hi rend="italic">Contemporary.</hi> He died in St
                    Petersburg on the 30th of April (12th May) 1889. (G. D.)</p>
