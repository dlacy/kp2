<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">with a </span><span class="font0">death’s head, ſurrounded by </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a laurel wreath </span><span class="font0">on one cuff, and a ſword on the other ; with the motto,&nbsp;&quot; Conquer or die.” The king was alſo ſurrounded by&nbsp;crowds </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font0">nonjuring prieſts and other diffaſſected perſons. Thus, that popular jealouſy which in every pe-riod of the revolution has ſtrikingly marked the French&nbsp;character, was kept on the alarm. On the 18th of A-pril, therefore, when the royal Family was preparing to&nbsp;go to St Cloud to pafs ſome days, a report was inſtant-ly ſpread that the king was about to fly from the country. The carriages were immediately ſurrounded by&nbsp;•people. La Fayette drew out the national guard, but&nbsp;they refuſed to act. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot; WC </span><span class="font0">know (exclaimed they)&nbsp;that we are violating the laws, but the ſafety of our&nbsp;country is the ſirſt law.” The King inſtantly went to&nbsp;the affembly, and with much ſpirit complained of the&nbsp;inſult. He was anſwered reſpectſully by the preſident,&nbsp;and continued bis journey. As the royal family had&nbsp;enjoyed a conſiderable degree of freedom for ſome time&nbsp;paſt, which was demonſtrated by the unſucceſsful oppo-ſition made to this journey—the preſent opportunity&nbsp;was embraced for intimating to foreign courts his ac-ceptance of the conſtitution ; and ali obnoxious perſons&nbsp;were difmiſſed from about his perſon. The breach of&nbsp;diſeipline on the part of the national guard on this occaſion was ſo much reſented by La Fayette, that he&nbsp;reſigned his command. Paris was thrown into conſternation ; and it was not till after the moſt univerſal&nbsp;ſolicitation that he was prevailed upon to refume his</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">About this time M. de Bouille, to whom the protection of the frontiers was entruſted, was employing, as it is now ſaid, every means in his power to render the&nbsp;country defencelefs. The garriſons were left unprovided ; diffunion was ſpread among the national troops;&nbsp;they were removed ſrom the frontiers, and their place&nbsp;was occupied by foreigners, wherever it could be done.&nbsp;The emigrants abroad, and their friends at home, were&nbsp;lying in wait for an opportunity of revolt ;—when ſuddenly, on the 2 iſt of June, it was announced from the&nbsp;Thuilleries, that the king, the queen, the dauphin, with&nbsp;monſieur and madame, had quitted the palace and the&nbsp;capital, without leaving any information of thcir inten-tion or their route. The emotion excited by this&nbsp;news among the multitude was a mixture of conſternation and rage. The national affembly, however, acted with much coolneſs. They inſtantly took upon&nbsp;themſelves the government, and decreed their fittings&nbsp;permanent. They ſent meffengers, at the ſame time,&nbsp;in all directions, to attempt to lay hold of the fugitives.&nbsp;Theſe had taken different routs. Monſieur and madame arrived ſaſely at Bruſſels on the 23d. The king,&nbsp;queen, and their children, when they came to a conſiderable diſtance from the capital, were furniſhed by&nbsp;Bouille with a guard of dragoons, under pretencc of&nbsp;protecting treaſure for the pay of the troops. At the&nbsp;diſtance of 156 miles, and when only a few leagues&nbsp;from the frontiers, they were arreſted at St Menehould&nbsp;by the poſtmaſter, M. Drouet, formerly a dragoon in&nbsp;the regiment of Condé. At half paſt feven o’clock in&nbsp;the evening the carriages ſtopt to change horſes at his&nbsp;houſe ; he thought he recollected the queen, and ima-gined that the king’s face reſembled the impreffions&nbsp;ſtamped upon affignats. The eſeort of dragoons in-</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">creaſed the ſuſpicion. He ſuffered them to depait at</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">U o'clock without notice; hut taking a çmnpmiitm </span><span class="font0">with him, he went by a ſhorter road to Varenneai&nbsp;with the affiſtance oſ the poſtmaſter there he gave the&nbsp;alarm, and overturned a carriage on the bridge, which&nbsp;detained the royal travellers till the national guard of&nbsp;the place had aſſembled, and the arreſt was effected&nbsp;without bloodſhed. They were brought back to Pa-ris by a deputation from the aſſembly. At his depar-ture, the king had imprudently left behind him a me-morial, in which he declared, that he never had thought&nbsp;any ſacrifice too great for the reſtoration of order ; but&nbsp;that the deſtruction of the kingdom, and the triumph&nbsp;of anarchy, being the only reward of all his efforts, he&nbsp;thought it neceſſary to depart from it. He then takes&nbsp;a review of the faults of the new conſtitution, the&nbsp;grievances he has ſuffered ; and proteſts againſt every&nbsp;thing that he had been compelled to do during his cap-tivity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Different parties were very differently affected by this ill-conducted and unfortunate flight of the King. A&nbsp;ſmall republican party had already begun to appear,&nbsp;and during the king’s abſence, attempts were made to&nbsp;induce the public at large to conſider the royal au-thority as no neceffary part of a free conſtitution. But&nbsp;the minds of men were by no means prepared for the re-ception of this new doctrine. The idea, however, ha·&nbsp;ving been thus publicly propoſed, left ſome impreffions,&nbsp;which in time contributed to give riſe to important&nbsp;events. By ſar the greater number of leading men,&nbsp;however, were at preſent convinced, that it was impoffible to conduct a great empire like France, well and pro-ſperouſly, without the aſſiſtance of an hereditary chief.&nbsp;They therefore determined to paſs over the affair with&nbsp;as much ſilence as poffible, and to haften the period&nbsp;when their new conſtitution ſhould be complete. But&nbsp;there is reaſon to believe, that this journey was at the&nbsp;long-run highly inſtrumental in producing very fatal effects to tbe perfonal ſafety oſ the monarch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His flight ſeemed a ſignal for emigration. Many of the ariſtocratic party ſent in reſignations of their&nbsp;feats in the national aſſembly. Troops were levied on&nbsp;the frontiers in the King’s name ; who took care, however, to diſavow any connection with ſuch a procedure.&nbsp;Bouille emigrated, and afterwards ſent to the aſſembly&nbsp;a furious threatening letter : &quot; You ſhall anſwer (fays&nbsp;he) ſor the lives of the king and of the queen to all&nbsp;the monarchs of the univerſe. Touch but a ſingle hair&nbsp;of their heads, and not one ſtone ſhall be left upon ano-ther in Paris. I know the roads. I will conduct the&nbsp;foreign armies. This letter is but the forerunner of&nbsp;the manifeſto of the ſovereigns of Europe.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A conſiderable calm throughout France followed theſe events, and it might be regarded as in a ſtate of&nbsp;tranquillity. It contained, indeed, parties entertaining&nbsp;much animoſity againſt each other, and many citizens had&nbsp;withdrawn to foreign countries ; but the peace was not&nbsp;broken, and moderate men hoped that much proſperity&nbsp;would follow from the late agitations. But this calm&nbsp;was deluſive ; and in the midſt of it thoſe projects were&nbsp;formed which were afterwards to prove ſo fatal to the&nbsp;peace of France and of Europe. Towards the cloſe of&nbsp;this ſummer, a convention took place at Pilnitz in Saxony between the emperor Leopold and the king of&nbsp;Pruffia. Its object was not known at the time, but it&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">gradually came into view, and is now by many under-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
