<p><span class="font1">JO to 50 verſts, and </span><span class="font0">in the wideſt places </span><span class="font1">as far as 70 </span><span class="font0">verſts. 8. The Tchani Lake lies in the deſerts of Ba-raba, between the rivers Obè and lrtiſh. It joins with&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">great many ſmaller lakes, occupies a vaſt tract of&nbsp;land, and abounds very much in ſiſh. 9. Between the&nbsp;Gulf of Finland and the White Sea there are ſeveral&nbsp;lakes which extend from 50 to 70 verſts in length ; and&nbsp;befides theſe there are many other ſalt lakes in different&nbsp;parts of Ruſſia, ſuch as the Ozero, that is, the lake El-tonſkoye, Bogdo, Inderſkoye, Ebele, Koryakovſkoye,&nbsp;Yamiſhevſkoye, Borovye, and others ; and the fait which&nbsp;is got from them ſerves for the uſe of the greateſt part&nbsp;of the empire. To theſe may be added the Caſpian,&nbsp;which, though called a ſea, is more properly a lake, as&nbsp;it has no communication with the ocean either viſible&nbsp;or ſubterraneous. See </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">CASPiAN-Sea,</span><span class="font0"> and Pneumatics,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">n<sup>0</sup> </span><span class="font0">277.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ruſſia boaſts likewiſe of a conſiderable number of large and famous rivers. Of the Dvina or Dwina, the Neva, Dnieper or Nieper, the Don, the Volga, the Trtis,&nbsp;the Onega, the Oby, and the Lena, the reader of this&nbsp;work will find ſome account under their reſpective&nbsp;names ; but in this vaſt empire there are many other rivers worthy of notice, tho’ not perhaps of ſuch minute&nbsp;deſcription. Among theſe the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bong,</span><span class="font0"> or, as it is ſometimes written, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bog,</span><span class="font0"> riſes in Poland ; then directing its&nbsp;courſe to the ſouth-eaſt, it divides the government of&nbsp;Ecatherinoſlav from the deſerts of Otchakov, now&nbsp;belonging to Ruſſia, and falle into the Liman, which&nbsp;communicates with the Black ſea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Kubane conſiſts of many ſprings or rivulets running out of the Caucaſian mountains, and divides itſelf into two branches, the one of which falls into the&nbsp;Azov Sea, and the other into the Black ſea. This river, from its ſource to the end of it, conſtitutes the&nbsp;frontier of Ruſſia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Oural, formerly Yaik, takes its riſe in the Oural mountains, in the government of Oufa, which it divides from that of Caucaſus, and extends its courſe about 3000 verſts. It receives many rivers, the principal of&nbsp;which are the Or, Sakmara, Yleck, and Terkool.—&nbsp;The Kouma riſes in the Caucaſian mountains, and runs&nbsp;through the plains between Terek and Volga, and at&nbsp;laſt lofes itſelf in the ſands, before it comes to the Caſpian ſea. The Terek originates in the Caucaſian&nbsp;mountains, runs between them, and then coming out,&nbsp;extends its courſe to the Caſpian Sea, and receives ſeveral rivers, as the Malka, Soonja, Bakſan, and Ack-ſay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Bolſhaya Petchora, that is, the great Petchora, riſes in the Oural mountains, in the government of Vologda, runs acroſs the whole breadth of the government&nbsp;of Archangel, and falls into the Icy ſea. It receives&nbsp;in its courſe ſeveral rivers, the principal of which are&nbsp;the Outcha and the Elma. The Eniſſey is formed by&nbsp;the junction of two rivers, the Oulookema and the&nbsp;Baykema, which riſe in the Altay mountains in Mun-galia. It runs through the whole extent of Siberia,&nbsp;and falls into the Icy Sea. The extent of the Eniſſey is&nbsp;about 2500 verſts. It receives in its courſe ſeveral rivers, the principal of which are the Abakan, Elogooy,&nbsp;Podkamennaya Tungouſka, Niznyaya Tungouſka, and&nbsp;Tourookhan. The Yana, the Indighirka, and the Kolhima, are likewiſe no inconſiderable rivers in the government of Iikoutſk. The ſirſt riſes in the mountains&nbsp;which overſhadow the banks of the river Lena </span><span class="font1">on the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">right hand, and extends its courſe 800 verſts. The two&nbsp;laſt take their ſources in the mountains which extend on&nbsp;the coaſts of the Eaſtern ſea. The length of the In-dighirka is 1200 and that of Kolhima 1500 verſts.—&nbsp;The laſt, near its mouth, is divided into two branches,&nbsp;and receives the rivers Omolon and Onooy. The Anadir&nbsp;is the eaſternmoſt of all the rivers in Siberia. It- riſes out&nbsp;of the lake Ioanko, in the diſtrict of Okhotſk, and runs&nbsp;through the eaſtern part of it, and then falls into the&nbsp;Eaſtern ocean The Amour is formed by the junction&nbsp;of two conſiderable rivers, the Shilka and Argoonya,&nbsp;which are joined juſt by the frontiers of China. It&nbsp;runs through the Chineſe dominions, and at laſt falls into the Eaſtern ocean. The Kamtſchatka runs through&nbsp;the peninſula oi the ſame name, extending its courſe&nbsp;from the Verkhney to Nizney Oſtrog, that is, from the&nbsp;upper to the lower fort, and falls into the Eaſtern&nbsp;ocean. The Penjina riſes in the Yablonnoy ridge of&nbsp;mountains, and falls into the Penjinſkaya Gooba, that is,&nbsp;the gulf or the ſea of Penjina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In ſuch a vaſt extent of country, ſtretching from the temperate ſo far into the frigid zone, the climate&nbsp;muſt vary conſiderably in different places. In the&nbsp;ſouthern parts of the Ruffian empire, the longeſt day&nbsp;does not exceed fifteen hours and a half ; whereas in&nbsp;the moſt northern, the ſun in ſummer is ſeen two months&nbsp;above the horizon. The country in general, though&nbsp;lying under different climates, is exceſſively cold in the&nbsp;winter. Towards the north, the country is covered&nbsp;near three quarters of the year with ſnow and ice ; and&nbsp;by the ſeverity of the cold many unfortunate perſons are&nbsp;maimed, or periſh. This fort of weather commonly&nbsp;ſets in about the latter end of Auguſt, and continues&nbsp;till the month of May ; in which interval the rivers arc&nbsp;frozen to the depth of four or five feet. Water thrown&nbsp;up into the air will fall down in icicles ; birds are frozen in their flight, and travellers in their ſledges. In&nbsp;ſome provinces the heats of ſummer are as ſcorching as&nbsp;the winter colds are rigorous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſoil of Muſcovy varies ſtill more than the climate, according to the influence of the ſun and the ſituation of the country. In the warmer provinces, thc proceſs of vegetation is ſo rapid, that corn is commonly&nbsp;reaped in two months after it begins to appear above the&nbsp;ſurface of the ground. Hence the great variety of&nbsp;muſhrooms produced ſpontaneouſly in Ruſſia, which&nbsp;may be conſidered as a comfortable relief to the poor,&nbsp;while they appear as delicacies at the tables of the rich.&nbsp;Above 1000 waggon-loads of them uſed to be fold annually in Moſcow. Perhaps it is on account of the ſcar-city of proviſions that ſuch a number of faſts are inſti-tuted in the Muſcovite religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Beſide^ tire productions already mentioned as peculiar to each of the three great natural diviſions of the empire, Muſcovy yields rhubarb, flax, hemp, paſture for&nbsp;cattle, wax, and honey. Among other vegetables, we&nbsp;find in Ruſſia a particular kind of rice called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">[ſyntha,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">plenty of excellent melons, and in the neighbourhood of&nbsp;Aſtracan the famous zoophyton, or animal plant, which&nbsp;the Mulcovites call </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bonnaret,</span><span class="font0"> or lambkin, from its reſemblance to a larnb. See the article </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scythian LAMB.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Agriculture in general is but little underſtood, and leſs proſecuted in this country. The moſt conſiderable&nbsp;articles in the oeconomy of a Ruffian farm are wax and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
