<p><span class="font1">his dominion®. But with his ſucceſſor it was otherwiſe ; for he, convinced that Luther’s doctrine muſt ſoon be&nbsp;totally deſtroyed and ſuppreſſed unleſs it received a ſpeedy and effectual ſupport, ordered Luther and Melancthon to draw up a body of laws relating to the form of&nbsp;eccleſiaſtical government, the method of public worſhip,&nbsp;&amp;c. which was to be proclaimed by heralds throughout&nbsp;his dominions. This example was followed by all the&nbsp;-princes and ſtates of Germany who renounced tlie papal&nbsp;ſupremacy ; and a like form of worſhip, diſcipline, and&nbsp;government, was thus introduced into all the churches&nbsp;’which di(Γented from that of Rome. This open renun-ciation of the Romiſh juriſdiction ſoon changed the face&nbsp;of affairs ; and the patrons of Popery ſoon intimated,&nbsp;in a manner not at all ambiguous, that they intended&nbsp;to make war on th¢ Lutheran party ; which would&nbsp;certainly have been put in execution, had not the trou-bles that took place in Europe diſconcerted their mea-fures. Οη the other hand, the Lutherans, apprized of&nbsp;theſe hoſtile intentions, began alſo to deliberate on a&nbsp;proper plan of defence againſt that fuperſtitious violence&nbsp;with which they were in danger of being aſſailed. The&nbsp;diet of the empire aſſembled at Spire, in the year 1526;&nbsp;where the emperor’s ambaſſadors were deſired to uſe&nbsp;their utmoſt endeavours to ſuppreſs all diſputes about&nbsp;religion, and to inſiſt upon the rigorous execution of&nbsp;the ientence which had been pronounced againſt Luther and his followers at worms. The greateſt part&nbsp;of the German princes oppoſed this motion with the ut-moſt refolution, declaring that they could not cxecute&nbsp;that ſentence, nor come to any determination with regard to the doctrines by which it had been occaſioned,&nbsp;Before the whole matter was ſubmitted to the decifion&nbsp;of a council lawfully aſſembled ; alleging farther, that&nbsp;tke deciſion of controverſies of this nature belonged&nbsp;properly to it, and to it alone. This opinion, after long&nbsp;and very warm debates, was adopted by a great majority, and at length confented to </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font1">the whole aſſembly:&nbsp;for it was unanimouſly agreed to preſent a ſolemn ad-tlrefs to the emperor, intreating him to aſſemble, without delay, a free and general council ; while in the mean&nbsp;time it was alſo agreed, that the princes of the empire&nbsp;ſhould, in their reſpective dominions, be at liberty to&nbsp;manage eccleſiaſtical affairs in the manner they ſhould&nbsp;think moſt proper ; yet ſo as to be able to give to God&nbsp;and the emperor a proper account of their adminiſtra-tion when it ſhould be required of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Theſe reſolutions proved extremely favourable to the cauſe of reformation ; neither had the emperor any lei-ſure for fome time to give diſturbance to the reformed.&nbsp;The war, which at this time enſued between him and&nbsp;the pope, gave the greateſt advantage to the friends of&nbsp;the reformed, and conſiderably augmented their number. Several princes, whom the fear of perſecution and&nbsp;puniſhment had hitherto prevented from lending their&nbsp;affiſtance, publicly renounced the Romiſh ſuperſtſtion,&nbsp;and introduced among their ſubjects the ſame forms of&nbsp;religious worſhip, and the ſame lyſtem of doctrine, that&nbsp;had been received in Saxony, others, though placed&nbsp;in ſuch circumſtances as diſcouraged them from acting&nbsp;in an open manner againſt the intereſts of the Roman&nbsp;pontiff, were, however, far from diſcovering the ſmalleſt&nbsp;oppoſition to thoſe who withdrew the people from his&nbsp;deſpotic yoke ; nor did they moleſt the private aſſem-blies of thoſe who had ſeparated themſelves from the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">church of Rome. And in general, all the Germans who, before theſe 1efolutions of the diet of Spire, had&nbsp;rejected the papal difcipline and doctrine, were now, in&nbsp;conſequencc of the libcrty they enjoyed, wholly employed in bringing their fchemes and plans to a certain de-gree of confidence, and in adding vigour and firmneſs&nbsp;to the cauſe in which they were engaged. But this&nbsp;tranquillity and liberty was of no long duration. In&nbsp;1529, a new diet was aſſembled at the ſame place by&nbsp;the emperor, after he had quieted the troubles in various parts of his dominions, and concluded a peace with&nbsp;the pope. The power which had been granted to princes of managing eccleſiaſtical affairs till the meeting of&nbsp;a general council, was now revoked by a majority of&nbsp;votes ; and every change declared unlawful that ſhould&nbsp;be introduced into the doctrine, diſcipline, or worſhip&nbsp;of the eſtabliſhed religion, before the determination of&nbsp;the approaching council was known. This decree was&nbsp;conſidered as iniquitous and intolerable by the elector&nbsp;of Saxony, the landgrave of Heſſe, and other members&nbsp;oſ the diet, who were perſuaded of the neceffity of a&nbsp;reformation. The promiſe of ſpeedily aſſembling a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">general</span><span class="font1"> council, they looked upon to be an artifice of the&nbsp;church of Rome ; well knowing, that a free and lawful&nbsp;council would be the Iaſt thing to which the pope would&nbsp;conſent. when, therefore, they found that all their&nbsp;arguments and remonſtrances made no impreffion upon&nbsp;Ferdinand the emperor’s brother, who preſided in the&nbsp;diet, Charles himſelf being then at Barcelona, they entered a ſolcmn proteſt againſt this decree on the 19th&nbsp;of April, and appealed to the emperor and a future&nbsp;council. Hence aroſe the denomination of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Protfiαnts,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">which from this period has been given to thoſe who ſeparate from the communion of the church of Rome.&nbsp;The princes of the empire who entered this proteſt&nbsp;were, John elector of Saxony; George elector of Bran-denburg ; Erneſt and Francis dukes of Lunenburgh ;&nbsp;the landgrave of Heſſe ; and the prince of Anhalt.&nbsp;Theſe were ſeconded by 13 imperial towns, viz. Straf-burg, U'lm, Nuremberg, Conſtance, Rottingen, wind-ſeim, Memmiπgen, Nortlingen, Lindaw, Kempton,&nbsp;Htilbron, wiſſemburg, and St Gall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The diſſenting princes, who were the protectors and heads of the reformed churches, had no ſooner entered&nbsp;their proteſt, than they fent proper perfons to the em-peror, who was then upon h13 paſſage from Spain to&nbsp;Italy, to acquaint him with their proceedings irf this&nbsp;matter. The miniſters employed in this commiſſion executed it with the greateſt intrepidity and prefence of&nbsp;mind ; but the emperor, exaſperated at the audacity of&nbsp;thoſe who prefumed to differ from him, cauſed the ambaſſadors to be arreſted. The news of this violent ſtep&nbsp;made the Proteſtant princes conclude, that their perſon-al ſafety, and the ſuccefs of their cauſe, depended entirely upon their own courage and union. They de-termined, therefore, to enter into a ſolemn confederacy:&nbsp;ſor which purpoſe they held ſeveral meetings at Rot,&nbsp;Nuremberg, Smalcald, and other places : but ſo different were their opinions and views, that they could determine upon nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">o∏e great obſtacle to the intended confederacy was the diſpute which had anſen between Luther and Zuinglius concerning the real preſence of Chriſt in the&nbsp;Lord’s Supper.
