<p><span class="font0">whom </span><span class="font1">he </span><span class="font0">entirely reduced, after they had waged war with the Romans for the ſpace of 107 years. Having&nbsp;ſubdued this untractable people, he penetrated into&nbsp;Hetruria, in order to relieve Sutrium, a town in that&nbsp;country in alliance with Rome, and beſieged by a numerous army of Hetrurians. But, notwithſtanding all&nbsp;the expedition Camillus could uſe, be did not reach the&nbsp;place before it had capitulated. The Sutrini, being&nbsp;greatly diſtreſſed for want of proviſions, and exhauſted&nbsp;with labour, had ſurrendered to the Hetrurians, who&nbsp;had granted them nothing but their lives, and the&nbsp;cloaths on their backs. In this deſtitute condition&nbsp;they had left their own country, and were going in&nbsp;ſearch of new habitations, when they met Camillus&nbsp;leading an-army to their relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The unfortunate multitude no ſooner ſaw the Romans, but they threw themſelves at the dictator’s ſeet, who, moved at this melancholy fight, deſired them to&nbsp;take a little reſt, and refreſh themſelves, adding, that&nbsp;he would ſoon dry up their tears, and transfer their&nbsp;ſorrows from them to their enemies. He imagined,&nbsp;that the Hetrurians would be wholly taken up in plundering the city, without being upon their guard, or&nbsp;obſerving any diſcipline. And herein he was not miſtaken. The Hetrurians did not dream that the dictator could come ſo ſpeedily from ſuch a diſtance to&nbsp;ſurpriſe them ; and therefore were wholly employed in&nbsp;plundering the houſes and carrying off the booty, or&nbsp;feaſting on the proviſions they had found in them.&nbsp;Many of them were put to the ſword, and an incredible&nbsp;number made priſoners ; and the city was reſtored to its&nbsp;ancient inhabitants, who had not waited in vain for the&nbsp;performance of the dictator’s promiſe. And now, after&nbsp;theſe glorious exploits, which were finiſhed in ſo ſhort&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">time, the great Camillus entered Rome in triumph a&nbsp;third time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">, Camillus having reſigned his dictatorſhip, the republic choſe. ſix new military tribunes, Q. Quinctius, Q-_ Servius, L. Julius, L. Aquilius, L. Lucretius, and Ser.&nbsp;Sulpitius. During their adminiſtration the country of&nbsp;the Æqui was laid waſte, in order to put it out of their&nbsp;power to revolt anew ; and the two cities of Cortuoſa&nbsp;and Contenebra, in the lucumony of the Tarquinienſes,&nbsp;were taken from the Hetrurians, and entirely demoliſhed. At this time it was thought proper to repair the&nbsp;Capitol, and add new works to that part of the hill&nbsp;where the Gauls had endeavoured to ſcale the citadel.&nbsp;Theſe works were eſteemed very beautiful, as Livy informs us, even in the time of Auguſtus, after the city&nbsp;was embelliſhed with moſt magnificent decorations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And now Rome being reinſtated in her former flouriſhing condition, the tribunes of the people, who&nbsp;had been for ſome time quiet, began to renew their ſeditious harangues, and revive the old quarrel about the&nbsp;diviſion of the conquered lands. The patricians had&nbsp;appropriated to themſelves the Pomptin territory lately&nbsp;•taken from the Volſci, and the tribunes laid hold of this&nbsp;opportunity to raiſe new diſturbances. But the citizens being ſo drained of their money that they had not&nbsp;enough left to cultivate new farms and ſtock them with&nbsp;cattle, the declamations of the tribunes made no impreſſion upon their minds ; ſo that the project vaniſhed.&nbsp;As for the military tribunes, they owned that their&nbsp;election had been defective ; and, leſt the irregularities&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">«f the former comitia ſhould be continued in the ſuc</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">ceeding ones, they voluntarily laid down their office. So that, after a ſhort interregnum, during which M.&nbsp;Manlius, Ser. Sulpitius, and L. Valerius Potſtus, governed the republic, fix new military tribunes L. Papirius, C. Sergius, L. Æmilius, L. Menenius, L. Vale·&nbsp;rius, and C. Cornelius, were choſen for the enſuing&nbsp;year, which was ſpent in works of peace. A temple,&nbsp;which had been vowed to Mars during the war with&nbsp;the Gauls, was built, and conſecrated by T. Quinctius,&nbsp;who preſided over the affairs of religion. As there had&nbsp;hitherto been but few Roman tribes beyond the Tiber&nbsp;which had a right of ſuffrage in the comitia, four new&nbsp;ones were added, under the. name of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">SteHatina, Tra-montina, Sabatιna,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Arntenſis;</span><span class="font0"> ſo that the tribes were&nbsp;now in all 25, which enjoyed the ſame rights and privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The expectation of an approaching war induced the centuries to chooſe Camillus one of the military tribunes&nbsp;for the next year. His colleagues were Ser. Cornelius,&nbsp;Q. Servilius, L. Quinctius, L. Horatius, and P. Valerius. As all theſe were men of moderation, they-agreed to inveſt Camillus with the ſole management of&nbsp;affairs in time of war ; and accordingly in full ſenate&nbsp;transferred all their power into his hands ; ſo that he »&nbsp;became in effect dictator. It had been already determined in the ſenate to turn the arms of the republic&nbsp;againſt the Hetrurians ; but, upon advice that the Antiates had entered the Pomptin territory, and obliged&nbsp;the Romans who had taken poſſeſſion of it to retire, it&nbsp;was thought neceſſary to humble them before the republic engaged in any other enterpriſe. The xAntiates&nbsp;had joined the Latin.9 and Hernici near Satricum ; ſo&nbsp;that the Romans, being terrified at their prodigious&nbsp;numbers, ſhewed themſelves very backward to engage :&nbsp;which Camillus perceiving, he inſtantly mounted his&nbsp;horſe, and riding through all the ranks of the army,&nbsp;encouraged them by a proper ſpeech ; after which he&nbsp;diſmounted, took the next ſtandard-bearer by the hand,&nbsp;led him towards the enemy, and cried out, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Soldiers, advance.</span><span class="font0"> The ſoldiery were aſhamed not tς&gt; follow a ge</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">neral who expoſed himſelſ to the firſt attack ; and therefore, having made a great ſhout, they fell upon the enemy with incredible fory. Camillus, in order to increaſe their eagerneſs ſtill more, commanded a ſtandard&nbsp;to be thrown into the middle of the enemy’s battalions ;&nbsp;which made the ſoldiers, who were fighting in the firſt&nbsp;ranks, exert all the reſolution they could to recover it.&nbsp;The Antiates, not being able any longer to make head&nbsp;againſt the Romans, gave way, and were entirely defeated. The Latins and Hernici ſeparated from the&nbsp;Volſci, and returned home. The Volſci, ſeeing themſelves thus abandoned by their allies, took refuge in the&nbsp;neighbouring'city of Satricum; which'Camillus immediately inveſted, and took by aſſault. The Volſei&nbsp;threw down their arms, and ſurrendered at diſcretion.&nbsp;He then left his army under the command of Valerius ;&nbsp;and returned to Rome to ſolicit the conſent of the ſenate, and to make the neceſſary preparations for undertaking the ſiege of Antium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But, while he was propoſtng this affair to the ſenate, deputies arrived from Nepet and Sutrium, two cities in alliance with Rome in the neighbourhood of He-truria, demanding ſuccours againſt the Hetrurians, who threatened to beſiege theſe two cities, which were&nbsp;the keys </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">Hetruria.
