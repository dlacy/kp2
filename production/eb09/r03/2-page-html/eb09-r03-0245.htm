<p><span class="font3">RUNCIMAN, </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Alexander</span><span class="font3"> (1736-1785), historical painter, was born in Edinburgh in 1736. He studied at&nbsp;the Foulis’s Academy, Glasgow, and at the age of thirty&nbsp;proceeded to Rome where he spent five years. It was at&nbsp;this time that he became acquainted with Fuseli, a kindred&nbsp;spirit, between whose productions and those of Runciman&nbsp;there is a marked similarity. The painter’s earliest efforts&nbsp;had been in landscape; “other artists,” it was said of&nbsp;him, “ talked meat and drink, but he talked landscape.”&nbsp;He soon, however, turned to historical and imaginative&nbsp;subjects, exhibiting his Nausicaa at Play with her&nbsp;Maidens in 1767 at the Free Society of British Artists, !&nbsp;Edinburgh. On his return from Italy, after a brief&nbsp;residence in London, where in 1772 he exhibited in the&nbsp;Royal Academy, he settled in Edinburgh, and was appointed&nbsp;master of the Trustees’ Academy. He was patronized by&nbsp;Sir James Clerk, whose hall at Penicuik House he decorated&nbsp;with a series of subjects from Ossian. He also executed&nbsp;various religious paintings and an altarpiece in the&nbsp;Cowgate Episcopal Church, Edinburgh, and easel pictures '&nbsp;of Cymon and Iphigenia, Sigismunda Weeping over the&nbsp;Heart of Tancred, and Agrippina Landing with the Ashes <sup>1&nbsp;</sup>of Germanicus. He died in Edinburgh on October 4, I&nbsp;1785. His works, while they show high intention and&nbsp;considerable imagination, are frequently defective in form '&nbsp;and extravagant in gesture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">RUNCIMAN, </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">John</span><span class="font3"> (1744-1766), historical painter, a younger brother of the above, accompanied him to Rome,&nbsp;and died at Naples in 1766. He was an artist of great&nbsp;promise. His Flight into Egypt, in the National Gallery&nbsp;of Scotland, is remarkable for the precision of its execution&nbsp;and the mellow richness of its colouring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">RUNCORN, a market-town and seaport of Cheshire, is pleasantly situated on the south side of the Mersey and&nbsp;near the terminus in that river of the Bridgewater, the&nbsp;Mersey and Irwell, and the Trent and Mersey Canals, 15&nbsp;miles S.E. of Liverpool and 15 N.E. of Chester. The&nbsp;Mersey, which here contracts to 400 yards at high water,&nbsp;is crossed by a wrought-iron railway bridge 1500 feet in&nbsp;length. The modern prosperity of the town dates from&nbsp;the completion in 1773 of the Bridgewater Canal, which&nbsp;here descends into the Mersey by a succession of locks.&nbsp;The town was made an independent landing port in 1847,&nbsp;and within recent years large additions have been made&nbsp;to the docks and warehouses. The town possesses shipbuilding yards, iron foundries, rope works, tanneries, and&nbsp;soap and alkali works. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 1490 acres) in 1871 was 12,443, and in&nbsp;1881 it was 15,126.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Owing to the Mersey being here fordable at low water, the place was in early times of considerable military importance. On a rock&nbsp;which formerly jutted some distance farther into the Mersey&nbsp;Ethelfleda erected a castle in Ö16, but of the building there are&nbsp;now no remains. She is also said to have founded a town, but&nbsp;probably it soon afterwards fell into decay, ns it is not noticed in&nbsp;Domosday. The ferry is noticed in a charter in the 12th century.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">RUNEBERG, </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Johan Ludwig</span><span class="font3"> (1804-1877), Swedish poet, was born at Jakobstad, in Finland, on the 5th of&nbsp;February 1804. Brought up by an uncle at Uleâborg, he&nbsp;entered the university of Âbo in the autumn term of 1822,&nbsp;and in 1826 began to contribute verses to the local newspapers. In the spring of 1827 he received the degree of&nbsp;doctor of philosophy, and shared in the calamity which, in&nbsp;September of the same year, destroyed the city and university of Abo with fire. Runeberg accepted a tutorship&nbsp;at Saarijiirvi, in the interior of Finland, where he remained&nbsp;for three years, studying hard and writing actively. The&nbsp;university had been removed after the great fire to Helsingfors, and in 1830 the young poet returned thither, as&nbsp;amanuensis to the council of the university. In the same&nbsp;year he published his first volume of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dikier</span><span class="font3"> (Poems), and a&nbsp;collection of Servian folksongs translated into Swedish.&nbsp;In 1831 his verse romance </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Grafven i Perrho</span><span class="font3"> (The Grave&nbsp;in Perrho) received the small gold medal of the Swedish&nbsp;Academy, and the poet married the daughter of Dr Teng-ström, archbishop of Finland. For a tractate on the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Medea&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">of Euripides he was in the same year appointed university&nbsp;lecturer on Roman literature. In 1832 he leaped at one&nbsp;bound to the foremost place among Swedish poets with&nbsp;his beautiful little epic </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Elgskyttarne</span><span class="font3"> (The Elk-Hunters) ;&nbsp;and in 1833 he published a second collection of lyrical&nbsp;poems. His comedy </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Friaren fran Landet</span><span class="font3"> (The Country&nbsp;Lover) was not a success in 1834. He returned to more&nbsp;characteristic fields in 1836, when he published the&nbsp;charming idyl in hexameters called </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Hanna.</span><span class="font3"> In 1837&nbsp;Runeberg accepted the chair of Latin at Borg;! College,&nbsp;and resided in that little town for the rest of his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From Borgâ he continued to pour forth volumes of verse, and he was now recognized in his remote Finland&nbsp;retirement as second only to Tegnér among the poets of&nbsp;Sweden. In 1841 he published </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Nadeschda,</span><span class="font3"> a romance of&nbsp;Russian life, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Julqudllen</span><span class="font3"> (Christmas Eve), an idyl.&nbsp;The third volume of his lyrical pieces bears the date 1843,&nbsp;and the noble cycle of unrhymed verse romances called&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rung Fjalar</span><span class="font3"> was published in 1844. Finally, in 1848,&nbsp;he achieved a great popular success by his splendid series&nbsp;of poems about the war of independence in 1808, a series&nbsp;which bears the name of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fdnrik Stals Sdgner</span><span class="font3"> (Ensign&nbsp;Steel’s Stories) ; a second series of these appeared in&nbsp;1860. From 1847 to 1850 the poet was rector of Borgâ&nbsp;College, a post which he laid down to take the only&nbsp;journey out of Finland which he ever accomplished, a visit&nbsp;to Sweden in 1851. His later writings may be briefly&nbsp;mentioned. In 1853 he collected his prose essays into a&nbsp;volume entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Smdrre Berdttelser.</span><span class="font3"> In the same year he&nbsp;was made president of a committee for the preparation of&nbsp;a national Psalter, which issued, in 1857, a Psalm-Book&nbsp;largely contributed by Runeberg for public use. He once&nbsp;more attempted comedy in his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kan ej</span><span class="font3"> (Can’t) in 1862,&nbsp;and tragedy, with infinitely more success, in his stately&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kungarne pa Salamis</span><span class="font3"> (The Kings at Salamis) in 1863.&nbsp;He collected his writings in six volumes in 1873-74.&nbsp;Runeberg died at Borgâ on the 6th of May 1877.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The poems of Runeberg show the influence of the Greeks and of Goethe upon his mind ; but he possesses a great originality. In&nbsp;an age of conventionality he was boldly realistic, yet never to the&nbsp;sacrifice of artistic beauty. Less known to the rest of Europe&nbsp;than Tegnér, he yet is now generally considered to excel him as a&nbsp;poet, and to mark the highest attainment hitherto reached by&nbsp;imaginative literature in Sweden.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">RUNNING. In this mode of progression the step is lighter and gait more rapid than in walking, from which&nbsp;it differs in consisting of a succession of springs from toe&nbsp;to toe, instead of a series of steps from toe to heel. As&nbsp;an athletic exercise, it has been in vogue from the earliest&nbsp;times, and the simple foot race, </span><span class="font0">δpd∕χoς, </span><span class="font3">run straight from&nbsp;starting point to goal, was a game of the Greek pentathlon. It was diversified with the διαυλοδρό/zoç, in which&nbsp;a distance mark was rounded and the starting and winning&nbsp;points were the same, and also by the </span><span class="font0">δρό/zoç οπλιτών,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">which might be compared to the modern heavy marching&nbsp;order race.
