        <p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Institution of the Peregrin
                Praetorship.—</span><span class="font2">The prsetorship@@<sup>1 </sup>was an outcome
                of the Licinian laws of the year 387 u.c.&nbsp;Down to the end of the 5th century
                the praetor then appointed superintended single-handed the administration
                of&nbsp;justice, alike between citizens and foreigners. But with&nbsp;the altered
                condition of things in the beginning of the&nbsp;6th century, and the influx of
                strangers which has already&nbsp;been alluded to, the &quot;work seems to have been
                found too&nbsp;onerous for a single magistrate, and a second praetor
                was&nbsp;appointed. The date is not absolutely certain, although&nbsp;generally
                assumed to have been about the year 512 u.c. ;&nbsp;but Pomponius says distinctly
                that the creation of the new&nbsp;office was rendered necessary by the increase of
                the peregrin&nbsp;population of Rome, and that the new magistrate got the&nbsp;name
                of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">praetor
                peregrinus</span><span class="font2"> because his principal duty was&nbsp;to
                dispense justice to this foreign element. After the&nbsp;submission of Sicily and
                Sardinia the number of the praetors&nbsp;was increased to four and after the
                conquest of Spain to&nbsp;six; Sulla raised the number to eight, and Caesar
                eventually to sixteen. But all the later creations were for special&nbsp;purposes;
                the ordinary administration of justice within the&nbsp;city was left with the
                representatives for the time of the&nbsp;two earliest, who came to be distinguished
                as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">prraetor&nbsp;urbanus (qui
                jus inter cives dicit)</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">praetor peregrinus.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">It
                would be going too far to speak of the latter as the principal author of the

                class="font2"> for a large proportion of&nbsp;the actions for enforcing </span><span

                rights were civil, not&nbsp;honorary,—a fact which proves that the rights they
                were&nbsp;meant to protect and enforce had their origin in the </span><span

                although moulded to meet new requirements by tacit&nbsp;consuetude and the agency of
                the jurists. But even in this&nbsp;view the peregrin praetor must have had a
                powerful influence in giving shape and consistency to the rising jurisprudence, by
                means of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"

                class="font1"> is only twice mentioned&nbsp; by ancient writers, and we know neither
                its precise date nor its&nbsp;specific provisions. And yet, to judge by its effects,
                it must have&nbsp;been one of the most important pieces of comitial legislation in
                the&nbsp;latter half of the republic ; for Gellius speaks of it as having
                given&nbsp;the deathblow to many of the institutions of the XII. Tables,&nbsp;and
                Gaius couples it with two Julian law’s as the statutory instruments whereby the
                formular system of procedure was substituted&nbsp;for that </span><span

                class="font1"> The probability is that it was enacted&nbsp;immediately or soon after

                to&nbsp;altered circumstances, and to fashion new actions on the </span><span

                >for the use of the peregrins to whom the procedure of the </span><span

                expressly authorized the insertion in the styles to be devised&nbsp;by them of
                clauses that would give protection when required against&nbsp;claims that in law
                were well founded but in fact inequitable. But,&nbsp;whatever may have been the
                actual provisions of the statute, the&nbsp;result was the introduction of a
                procedure which gradually supplanted that by the “actions of the law,” which was
                much more&nbsp;pliant than the latter, and whose characteristic was
                this,—that,&nbsp;instead of the issue being declared by w’ord of mouth by the
                parties,&nbsp;and requiring in many cases to embody with perfect accuracy
                the&nbsp;statutory provision upon which it was based, it was now formulated&nbsp;in
                writing by the praetor, in the shape of an instruction to the judge&nbsp;to inquire
                and consider, with power to condemn or acquit according</span></p>

                > was no doubt due to a large extent to provincial conquests.&nbsp;But these
                operated also in other directions. The authorities who</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">f</span><span class="font1">troceeded to the conquered provinces as
                governors found themselves ace to face with laws and institutions in many respects
                differing&nbsp;from those of Rome. Political considerations dictated how
                far&nbsp;these were to be respected, how far subverted. In some provinces,&nbsp;more
                especially the Eastern ones, it was thought unnecessary to do&nbsp;more than
                supplement the existing system by the importation of&nbsp;doctrines of the
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium</span><span
                class="font1"> and the procedure of the praetor’s&nbsp;edicts ; while in others, in
                which it was deemed expedient to destroy&nbsp;as rapidly as possible all national
                feeling and every national rallying point, a Romanizing of all their institutions
                was resorted to,&nbsp;even to the extent of introducing some of the formal
                transactions&nbsp;which previously had been confined to citizens. But in either
                case&nbsp;there was a reflex action. The native institution had to be
                studied,&nbsp;its advantages and disadvantages balanced, the means
                considered&nbsp;of adapting it to the preetorian procedure, and the new ideas
                so&nbsp;presented as to make them harmonize as far as possible with the&nbsp;old.
                All this was a training of no small value for those who, on&nbsp;their return to
                Rome, were to exercise an influence on legislation&nbsp;and the administration of
                the law. They brought back with them&nbsp;not merely an experience they could not
                have obtained at home,&nbsp;but sometimes a familiarity with foreign institutions
                that they&nbsp;were very willing to acclimatize in Italy. Rome thus
                enriched&nbsp;its law from the provinces, deriving from them its
                emphyteutic&nbsp;tenure of land, its hypothec, its Rhodian law of general
                average,&nbsp;and a variety of other features that were altogether novel.
                Some&nbsp;of them were sanctioned by tacit recognition, others by edicts of&nbsp;the
                prsetors ; but, in whatever way received, they were indirectly&nbsp;fruits of
                provincial conquest.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Spread of Literature and
                Philosophy.—</span><span class="font1">The effect on Roman civilization of the
                addiction of educated men in the later republic&nbsp;to literature and philosophy is
                a matter for consideration in connexion with Rome’s general history. It is not
                proposed to consider&nbsp;here the question how far specific doctrines of Roman law
                bear the&nbsp;impress of the influence of the schools, especially that of the
                Stoics;&nbsp;it is a subject much too large to be disposed of in a few
                    lines.@@<sup>2</sup> The&nbsp;matter is mentioned simply for the sake of noting
                that the spirit&nbsp;of critical inquiry aroused and fostered by literary and
                philosophical&nbsp;study, seriously and conscientiously undertaken, contributed
                greatly&nbsp;to promote a new departure in jurisprudence that became
                very&nbsp;marked in the time of Cicero—the desire to subordinate form
                to&nbsp;substance, the word spoken to the will it was meant to manifest,&nbsp;the
                abstract rule to the individual case to which it was proposed&nbsp;to apply it. This
                was the first effort of what then was called&nbsp;equity to temper and keep within
                bounds the rigour of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >jus&nbsp;strictum.</span><span class="font1"> The prsetors, the judges, and the
                jurisconsults all had&nbsp;their share in it. Although modern jurists are prone to
                speak of&nbsp;praetorian equity as if it were a thing apart, yet the same spirit
                was&nbsp;leavening the law in all directions and in the hands of all who had&nbsp;to
                deal with it, the difference being that the form and publicity&nbsp;of the edict
                gave to its applications by the prsetors a more prominent and enduring record than
                was found in the decisions of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">private judices</span><span class="font1"> or the
                opinions of counselling jurisconsults.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Decline of Religion and
                Morals.—</span><span class="font2">It would be equally out of place to enlarge here
                on the causes and manifestations of that decline in religious sentiment and public
                and&nbsp;private virtue which was fraught with such disastrous&nbsp;results in the
                later days of the republic. The private law&nbsp;was influenced by it to a
                considerable extent, alike in&nbsp;those branches which regulated the domestic
                relations and&nbsp;those which dealt with property and contract.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The ever-increasing disregard of the sanctity of the marriage tie is
                one of those features in the history of the&nbsp;period which strikes even the most
                unobservant. While&nbsp;from the first the law had denounced causeless
                separation&nbsp;and visited it with penalties, in principle it maintained&nbsp;the
                perfect freedom of divorce,—that it was improper to&nbsp;force persons to continue
                in the bonds of matrimony&nbsp;between whom matrimonial affection no longer
                existed.&nbsp;With the simple and frugal habits of the first five
