Area, 4656 acres.</p><p>The situation of Retford <hi rend="italic">CRedforde, Raiford),</hi> near one of the Roman roads and on the river Idle, where there was possibly a ford, may account for its origin. In 1086 the archbishop of York owned a mill at Retford, and Roger de Busli had rights here. Retford was a borough by prescription, and was in the hands of the crown when, in 1276, Edward I. granted it to the burgesses in fee-farm with the right of electing bailiffs. This charter was confirmed by Edward III., Henry VI. and Elizabeth. In 1607 lames I. granted a. charter of incorporation to the bailiffs and burgesses, under which the town was governed until 1835, when it was rcincorporated under a mayor. East Retford returned two members to parliament in 1315, and again from 1572 till 1885, when it was disfranchised. Henry III. granted the burgesses an eight-days’ fair at Holy Trinity, altered by Edward II. to St Gregory. Edward III. granted a six-days’ fair at St Margaret, and Henry VI. a four-days’ fair at St Matthew. Fairs are now held in March, June, July and December. The market held on Saturdays by prescription was sanctioned by Edward IIL and still exists.</p>
