                <p><label>ROMANCE</label> in matters of literature, a fabulous relation of certain
                    adventures deſigned for the entertainment and inſtruction of the readers, and
                    differing from the <hi rend="italic">novel,</hi> as it always exhibits actions
                    great, dangerous, and generally extravagant. Many authors of the firſt name have
                    written on the ancient <hi rend="italic">romance.</hi> It has exerciſed the
                    pen of Hurd, of Warburtcn, and of fomé ladies, who have not thought it any
                    derogation to the ſenſibility of their ſex to unite antiquarian reſearch with
                    the cultivation of the <hi rend="italic">belles lettres.</hi> We have not,
                    however, ſeen anywhere ſo conciſe, jtiſt, and elegant an account of the origin
                    and progreſs of <hi rend="italic">romances</hi> as in H’lſraeli’s Curioſities
                    of Literature. “ Romance (ſays this writer) has been elegantly defined the
                    offspring of fiction and love. Men of learning have amuſed themſelves with
                    tracing the epoeha of romances. In thia</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0324" facs="gri_33125011196389_0330.tif"/>
                <p>reſearch they have displayed more ingenuity than judgement; and ſome have
                    fancied that it may have exiſted as far back as the time of Ariſtotle; Dearchus,
                    one of his diſciples, having written ſeveral works of this amuſing ſpecies.</p>
                <p>“ Let us, however, be ſatisfied in deriving it from the Theagenes and Chariclea
                    of Heliodorus, a biſhop who lived in the 4th century, and whoſe work has been
                    lately tranſlated. This elegant prelate was the Grecian Fenelon<note

                        An ingenious and learned friend inquires, 
                        'Is not the romance of the Golden Aſs, by Apuleius,
                        to be conſidered as an earlier ſpecimen than that of Heliodorus?’ To
                        this our author has no objection; but he would not warrant <hi rend="italic">any</hi> romance to be the <hi rend="italic">firſt</hi> that ever was
                        written. It is thus that ſome writers, more learned than ſagacious, have
                        diſcovered the firſt inventor of epiſtolary correſpondence. A lady receives
                        this honour: ſuch learning is deſperate! From the Aſiatic Reſearches and
                        other publications on Oriental literature, we are led to believe, that the
                        native country of romance is the eaſt;where it ſeems to have flouriſhed in
                        all its extravagant grandeur from time immemorial.</note>. Beautiful as
                    theſe compoſitions are when the imagination of the writer is ſufficiently ſtored
                    with accurate obſervations on human nature, in their birth, like many of the
                    fine arts, they found in the zealots of religion men who oppoſed their progreſs.
                    However Heliodorus may have delighted thoſe who were not in-ſenſible to the
                    felicities of a fine imagination, and to the enchanting elegancies of ſtyle, he
                    raiſed himſelf, among his brother eccleſiaſtics, enemies; who at length ſo far
                    prevailed, that it was declared by a ſynod, that his performance was dangerous
                    to young perſons, and that if the author did not ſuppreſs it, he muſt reſign his
                    biſhoprick. We are told he preferred his romance to his biſhoprick. Even ſo late
                    as in Racine’s time, it was held a crime to peruſe theſe unhallowed pages. He
                    informs us, that the firſt effuſions of his muſe were in conſequence of ſtudying
                    that ancient romance, which his maſter obſerving him to devour with the keenneſs
                    of a famiſhed man, he ſnatched it from his hands and flung it in the fire; a
                    ſecond copy experienced the ſame fate. What could Racine do? He bought a third,
                    and took the precaution of devouring it ſecretly till he got it by heart; after
                    which he offered it to his maſter with a ſmile to burn, if he choſe, like the
                    others.</p>
                <p>The deciſion of theſe bigots was founded in their opinion of the immorality of
                    ſuch works. They alleged, that the writers paint too warmly to the imagination,
                    addreſs themſelves too forcibly to the paſſions; and in general, by the freedom
                    of their repreſentations, hover on the borders of indecency. This cenſure is
                    certainly well-founded. Many of the old romances, and even of the dramas, acted
                    in Scotland two centuries ago, are ſuch as common proſtitutes would in this age
                    think indecent. But we are at preſent concerned with the origin of romance.</p>
                <p>“ The learned Fleury thinks that they were not known till the 12th century, and
                    gives as their original the hiſtory of the dukes of Normandy. Verdier, whoſe
                    opinion is of no great weight, ſays the invention of romance was owing to the
                    Normans of France; and that theſe fictions being originally written in the old
                    Norman language, they were intitled <hi rend="italic">Normances;</hi> the name
                    was afterwards altered to that of <hi rend="italic">Romances.</hi> The
                    Spaniards, who borrowed them from the French, called them <hi rend="italic">Romanzes,</hi> which alſo did the Italians.</p>
                <p>“ Dom Rivet, one of the learned aſſociates of the con</p>
                <p>gregation of St Maur, authors of the Literary Hiſtory of France, fixes their
                    origin in the 10th century. He ſays, that the moſt ancient romance known was one
                    which appeared in the middle of that century, under the title of <hi
                        rend="italic"> Philomena,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">the Beloved.</hi> This romance contains the pretended exploits of Charlemagne before Narbonne. At
                    Toulouſe, he tells us, they have pre-ſerved a copy of the Philomena in its
                    original language; that is to ſay, the Romaunt or poliſhed; ſuch as was then
                    ſpoken at court. They preferred this language to the Latin, which was then that
                    of the. common people, but vitiated with their corruptions.</p>
                <p>“ So far have we travelled on the road of conjecture: we ſhall now turn into the
                    path of fact. It is certain that theſe compoſitions derive their name from the
                    language in which they were firſt written. Abbé Iraild has given us the
                    character of the earlieſt romances, which we ſhall tranſcribe; for to add to
                    what is well ex-preſſed, however it may pleaſe the vanity of a writer, ſeldom
                    tends to the gratification of the reader.</p>
                <p>‘ The firſt romances were a monſtrous aſſemblage of hiſtories, in which truth
                    and fiction were equally blended, but all without probability; a compoſition of
                    amorous adventures, and all the extravagant ideas of chivalry. The incidents are
                    infinitely multiplied; deſti-tute of connection, of order, and art. Theſe are
                    the ancient and miſerable romances which Cervantes, in his celebrated ſatirical
                    romance of Don Quixote, has covered with an eternal ridicule. '</p>
                <p>“ It is, however, from theſe productions rather in their improved ſtate, that
                    poets of all nations have drawn their richeſt inventions. The agreeable wildneſs
                    of that fancy which characteriſed the eaſtern nations was caught by. the
                    cruſaders. When they returned home, they mingled in their own the cuſtoms of
                    each country. The Saracens, who were men like themſelves, becauſe they were of
                    another religion, and were therefore- their enemies, were pictured under the
                    tremendous form of <hi rend="italic">Pay-dim Giants.</hi> The credulous reader
                    of that day followed with trembling anxiety the <hi rend="italic">Red-croſs
                        Knight.</hi> It was thus that fiction embelliſhed religion, and religion
                    invigorated fiction. Such incidents have enlivened the cantos of Arioſto, and
                    adorned the epic of Taffo. Spenſer is the child of their creation; and it is
                    certain that we are indebted to them for ſome of the bold and ſtrong touches of
                    Milton. ”</p>
                <p>Other circumſtances however have been aſſigned as the ſources of theſe
                    extravagant fictions. “ Caſtles were, erected to repulſe the vagrant attacks of
                    the Normans; and in France (from the year 768 to 987) theſe places became fatal
                    to the public repoſe. The petty deſpots who raiſed theſe caſtles, pillaged
                    whoever paſſed, and carried off the females who pleaſed them. Rapine, of every
                    kind, was the privilege of Lords! Mezeray ob-ſerves, that it is from theſe
                    circumſtances romancers</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0325" facs="gri_33125011196389_0331.tif"/>
                <p>have invented their tales of knights-errant, monſters, and giants.</p>
                <p>“ De Saint Foix, in his Hiſtorical EiΓays on this ſubject, thus expreſſes
                    himſelf: ‘ Women and girls were not in greater ſecurity when they paſſed by
                    abbeys. The monks ſuſtained an aſſault rather than relinquiſh their prey: if
                    they ſaw themſelves lofing ground, they brought to their walls the relics of
                    ſome ſaint. Then it generally happened that the aſſailants, ſeized with awful
                    veneration, retired, and dared not to purſue their vengeance. This is the origin
                    of the enchanters, of the enchantments, and of the enchanted caſtles, deſcribed
                    . in romances.’</p>
                <p>“ To theſe may be added what the author of Northern Antiquities, Vol, I. p. 243,
                    writes, that ‘ as the walls of the caſtles ran winding round them, they often
                    called them by a name which ſignified <hi rend="italic">ſrpents</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic"> dragons;</hi> and in theſe were commonly ſecured the women
                    and young maids of diſtinction, who were ſeldom ſafe at a time when ſo many bold
                    warriors were rambling up and down in ſearch of adventures. It was this cuſtom
                    which gave occaſion to ancient romancers, who knew not how to deſcribe any thing
                    limply, to invent ſo many fables concerning princeſſes of great beauty, guarded
                    by dragons.’</p>
                <p>“ The Italian romances of the 14th century were ſpread abroad in great numbers.
                    They formed the polite literature of the day. But if it is not permitted to
                    authors freely to expreſs their ideas, and give full play to the imagination,
                    theſe works muſt never be placed in the ſtudy of the rigid moraliſt. They indeed
                    puſhed their indelicacy to the verge of groſſneſs, and ſeemed rather to ſeek
                    than to avoid ſcenes which a modern would bluſh to deſcribe. They (to employ the
                    expreſſion of one of their authors) were not aſhamed to name what God had
                    created. Cinthio, Bandello, and others, but chiefly Boccacio, rendered
                    libertiniſm agreeable, by the faſcinating charms of a poliſhed ſtyle, and a
                    luxuriant imagination.</p>
                <p>“ This however muſt not be admitted as an apology for immoral works ; for poiſon
                    is ſtill poiſon, even when it is delicious. Such works were, and ſtill continue
                    to be, the favourites of a nation which is ſtigmatiſed for being prone to
                    illicit pleaſures and impure amours. They are. ſtill curious in their editions,
                    and are not par* ſimonious in their price for what they call an uncaſtra-ted
                    copy. There are many Italians, not literary men, who are in poſſeſſion of an
                    ample library of theſe old noveliſts.</p>
                <p>“ If we paſs over the moral irregularities of theſe romances, we may diſcover a
                    rich vein of invention, which only requires to be releaſed from that rubbiſh
                    which disfigures it to become of an invaluable price. The Decamerons, the
                    Hecatommiti, and the Novellas of theſe writers, made no inconſiderable figure in
                    the little library of our Shakeſpeare. Chaucer is a notorious imitator and lover
                    of them; his Knight’s Tale is little more than a paraphraſe of Boccacio’s <hi
                        rend="sup"> r</hi> Γefeoide. Fontaine has caught all their charms with all
                    their licentiouſneſs. From ſuch works, theſe great poets, and many of their
                    contemporaries, frequently borrowed their plots ; not uncommonly kindled at
                    their flame the ardour of their genius ; but bending too ſubmiſſively to their
                    own peculiar taſte, or that of their age, in extracting the ore, they haγe not
                    purified it of the alloy.</p>
                <p>“ We muſt now turn our contemplation to the Frendh romances of the laſt century.
                    They were then carried to a point of perfection, which as romances they cannot
                    exeeed. To this the Aſtyea of D’Urſe greatly contributed. It was "followed by
                    the illuſtrious Baſſa, the great Cyrus, Clelia, &amp;c. which, though not
                    adapt” ed to the preſent age, gave celebrity to their authors. Their ſtyle, as
                    well as that of the Aſtrea, is diffuſe and inſipid. Zaide (attributed by ſome to
                    Segrais, but by Huet to Madame La Fayette) and the princeſs of Cleves are
                    tranſlated, and though they are maſterpieces of the kind, were never popular in
                    our country, and are little adapted to its genius.</p>
                <p>“ It is not ſurpriſing that romances have been regarded as pernicious to good
                    ſenſe, morals, taſte, and literature. It was in this light they were conſidered
                    by Boileau ; becauſe a few had ſucceeded, a croud imitated their examples.
                    Gombervilk and Scudery, and a few more were admired ; but the ſatiiiſt diſſolved
                    the illuſion. 1 his he did moſt effectually by a dialogue, in which he ridicules
                    thoſe citizens of a certain diſtrict, whoſe characters were concealed in theſe
                    romances, under the names of Brutus, Horace Codes, Lucretius, and Clelia. This
                    dialogue he only read to his friends, and did not give it ſor a long time to the
                    public, as he eſteemed mademoiſelle de Scudery : but when at length it was
                    publiſhed, it united all the romance writers againſt our ſatiriſt.</p>
                <p>“ From romances, which had now exhauſted the patience of the public, ſprung
                    novels. They attempted to allure attention by this inviting title, and reducing <hi rend="sup">-</hi> their works from ten to two volumes. The name of
                    romance diſguſted ; and they ſubſtituted thoſe of hiſtories, lives, memoirs, and
                    adventures. In theſe works (obſerves Irail) they quitted the unnatural
                    incidents, the heroic projects, the complicated and endleſs intrigues, and the
                    exertion of noble paſſions ; heroes were not now taken from the throne, they
                    were ſought for even amongſt the loweſt ranks of the people. On this ſubject, I
                    ſhall juſt obſerve, that a novel is a very dangerous poiſon in the hand of a
                    libertine ; it may be a ſalutary medicine in that of a virtuous writer.” See
