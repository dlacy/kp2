<p><label>RANDOM</label>
(older forms <hi rend="italic">randon, randoun;</hi> from the French, cf. <hi rend="italic">randir,</hi> to run quickly, impetuously; generally taken to be of Teutonic origin and connected with Ger. <hi rend="italic">Rand,</hi> edge, brim, the idea being possibly of a brimming river), an adjective originally meaning impetuous, hasty, hence done without purpose or aim, haphazard. The term “ random work ’’ is used, in architecture, by the rag-stone masons, for stones fitted together at random without any attempt at laying them in courses. “ Random coursed work ’’ is a like term applied to work coursed in horizontal beds, but the stones are of varying height, and fitted to one another (see Masonry).</p>
