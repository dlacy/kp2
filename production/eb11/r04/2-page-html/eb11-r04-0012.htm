<p><span class="font1">individual ownership was paramount, it was still considered a disgrace for </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font1">man to alienate his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">heredium.</span><span class="font1"> But though the&nbsp;existence of monogamous families seems to ‘imply private&nbsp;ownership to some extent, yet, as formerly indicated, a large&nbsp;part of the Roman territory at, and for a good while after,&nbsp;the foundation of the city must have been gentile lands held&nbsp;by the separate clans for the use of their members. The fact&nbsp;that the majority of the rural tribes bore the names of well-known patrician </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gentes</span><span class="font1"> favours the conclusion that even in the&nbsp;later regal period a good many of the clans still held lands&nbsp;in their collective capacity. It was at some uncertain time&nbsp;before Servius that there began to be a break-up of these gentile&nbsp;lands and their appropriation by individual members. Under&nbsp;the influence of this movement lands were acquired and held&nbsp;by families and individuals to a large extent. A patrician’s&nbsp;holding must have been sometimes pretty large so as to enable&nbsp;him to make grants (so often alluded to by ancient writers)&nbsp;to his clients, but we have no means of estimating the normal&nbsp;size. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">heredia</span><span class="font1"> were small; even during the Republic there&nbsp;is some evidence </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font1"> the traditional story about Cincinnatus)&nbsp;that seven jugera were regarded as the normal extent of a&nbsp;patrician’s holding for his own and his family’s use. On the&nbsp;other hand, twenty jugera are commonly supposed to have&nbsp;been the qualification for enrolment in the first of the Servian&nbsp;classes. Of course it must be kept in view that a patrician&nbsp;did not necessarily hold all his lands by gratuitous assignation&nbsp;or concession either from the state or from his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens',</span><span class="font1"> purchase&nbsp;from the former was by no means uncommon, and it may&nbsp;have been on his purchased lands that his clients were usually&nbsp;placed. Those dependants were also probably employed </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">large numbers upon those parts of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ager publicus</span><span class="font1"> which were&nbsp;occupied by the patricians and were in historic times known&nbsp;as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">possessions.</span><span class="font1"> These, of course, were not the property of&nbsp;their occupants; it was the lands acquired by assignation or&nbsp;purchase that were alone, apart from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">heredia,</span><span class="font1"> regarded as&nbsp;theirs </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ex jure Quiritium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The traditional accounts of the early distribution of lands among the plebeians are even, if possible, more vague than those&nbsp;regarding the patricians. They had apparently become&nbsp;holders </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span class="font1"> of land in large numbers before the&nbsp;Servian reforms. But they can have attained that&nbsp;position only by gradual stages. While their earliest&nbsp;grants of land, probably from the kings, can only have&nbsp;been during pleasure, latterly, as they increased in number and&nbsp;importance, they were allowed to have permanent possession.&nbsp;That those who had means also acquired lands by purchase&nbsp;from the state may be taken for granted. The distinction&nbsp;between </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span class="font1"> possession and ownership was at best a very&nbsp;vague one at this period, and, like the holders of provincial&nbsp;lands in later times, the plebeians might have the benefits of&nbsp;ownership without ownership. The result of the Servian constitution was to convert this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span class="font1"> property or permanent</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">possession into quiritarian ownership.<sup>@@1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are some writers who maintain that in the regal period, prior to the Servian reforms, though after the collective ownership of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gentes</span><span class="font1"> had begun to disintegrate, there&nbsp;was no private property in movables. This proposition can at most be accepted only in a qualified sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If it be meant that movables generally were not then recognized as objects of quiritarian </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dominium</span><span class="font1"> which could be vindicated&nbsp;by any real action, it may be admitted. But otherwise the&nbsp;distinction between </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">meum</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tuum</span><span class="font1"> must have been well&nbsp;recognized, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span class="font1"> at least. Men must have been in the habit&nbsp;of transferring things from one to another by simple deUverv&nbsp;in respect of barter, sale or otherwise, and any violent or&nbsp;“ theftuous ” appropriation of things in a man’s occupation&nbsp;would be punished by magisterial authority or by ordinary&nbsp;self-redress by the injured party. A sort of ownership in</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">possession must at least have been recognized for movables generally.<sup>@@2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But apart from this, we must believe that certain kinds of movables, viz. those which have been described as appurtenant&nbsp;to land and necessary for its cultivation—which with land&nbsp;formed the real objects, as distinct from the personal subjects,&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">familia—</span><span class="font1">were treated from the time of Romulus downwards, as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in manu</span><span class="font1"> of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patresfamilias.</span><span class="font1"> These were the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res&nbsp;mancipi</span><span class="font1"> already referred to. Quiritarian ownership in them,&nbsp;as we have seen, was recognized both for patricians and plebs&nbsp;by the Servian constitution, periodical registration of them in&nbsp;the census and transference by the quasi-public act of mancipation being probably required. Earlier even than with lands,&nbsp;the conception of private ownership, it has been said, connected&nbsp;itself with them.<sup>@@3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A short explanation may now be given of the ceremony of mancipation and the nature of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mancipation is described by Gaius, with particular reference to the conveyance of movable </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi,</span><span class="font1"> as a pretended sale in&nbsp;presence of not less than five citizens as witnesses and a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">libripens</span><span class="font1"> holding a pair of copper scales. The transferee,&nbsp;with one hand on the thing being transferred, and using&nbsp;certain words of style, declared it his by purchase with a piece&nbsp;of copper (which he he’d in his other hand) and the scales </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(hoc acre&nbsp;aeneaque libra)',</span><span class="font1"> and simultaneously he struck the scales with the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">as,</span><span class="font1"> which he then handed to the transferrer as figurative of the&nbsp;price. The principal variation when it was-an immovable that&nbsp;was being transferred was that, the mancipation did not require&nbsp;to be on the spot: the land was simply described by its known name&nbsp;in the valuation roll. Although in the time of Gaius only a fictitious&nbsp;sale—in fact the formal conveyance upon a relative contract—yet&nbsp;it was not always so. Its history is very simple.. The use ol the&nbsp;scales fixes its introduction at a time when coined money was&nbsp;not yet current, but raw copper nevertheless had become a standard&nbsp;of value and in a manner a medium of exchange. That, however,&nbsp;was not in the first days of Rome. Then, and for a long time,&nbsp;values were estimated in cattle or sheep, fines were imposed in&nbsp;them, and the deposits in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legis actio sacramento (infra,</span><span class="font1"> p. 549)&nbsp;took the same form. The use of copper as a substitute for them&nbsp;in private transactions was probably derived from Etruria. But,&nbsp;being only raw metal or foreign coins, it could be made available&nbsp;for loans or payments only when weighed in the scales: it passed&nbsp;by weight, not by tale. There is no reason for supposing that&nbsp;the weighing was a solemnity, that it had any significance beyond&nbsp;its obvious purpose of enabling parties to ascertain that a vendor&nbsp;or borrower was getting the amount of copper for which he had&nbsp;bargained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It was this practice of everyday life in private transactions that Servius apparently adopted as the basis of his mancipatory conveyance, engrafting on it one or two new features intended to give&nbsp;it publicity and, as it were, state sanction, and thus render it more&nbsp;serviceable in the transfer of censuable property. Instead of the&nbsp;parties themselves using the scales, an impartial balance-holder,&nbsp;probably an official, was required to undertake the duty, and at&nbsp;least five citizens were required to attend as witnesses, who were&nbsp;to be the vouchers to the census officials of the regularity of the&nbsp;procedure. Whether they were intended as representatives of&nbsp;the five classes in which Servius had distributed the population,&nbsp;and thus virtually of the state, is disputed, though the fact that,&nbsp;when the parties appealed to them for their testimony, they were&nbsp;addressed not as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">testes</span><span class="font1"> but as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Quirites</span><span class="font1"> lends some colour to this&nbsp;view.<sup>@@4</sup> Servius is also credited with the introduction of rectangular&nbsp;pieces of copper of different but carefully adjusted weights, stamped&nbsp;by his authority with various devices </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(aes signatum),</span><span class="font1"> which are</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@3</sup> Mancipation seems to have been a very ancient mode of conveyance. The use of the balance in barter or sale was known to the ancient Egyptians at least as early as 2000 B.C., as may be&nbsp;seen on reliefs in the temple of Dehr-el-Bahri in Upper Egypt.&nbsp;The derivation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mancipium (mancipatio)</span><span class="font1"> from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manu capere,</span><span class="font1"> to&nbsp;seize with the hand, is given by Gaius and is confirmed by the fact&nbsp;that at all times in its history the acquirer had to lay his hand on&nbsp;the thing being acquired, during the ceremony, if a movable. So&nbsp;where several things were being mancipated in a lot, this had to&nbsp;be done to each separately. With lands and other immovables it&nbsp;was different: they snight be mancipated in absence, which goes&nbsp;some way to prove that mancipation must have been extended&nbsp;to them at a later period. The derivation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mancipatio</span><span class="font1"> given by&nbsp;Muirhead </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Historicat Introduction,</span><span class="font1"> 2nd ed., pp. 59 seq.) from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manum&nbsp;capere, i.e. to</span><span class="font1"> acquire power </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(manus),</span><span class="font1"> is open to the objection that&nbsp;it places the abstract idea of power before the concrete symbol of&nbsp;it.
