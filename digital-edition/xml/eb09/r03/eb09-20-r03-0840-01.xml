a district town of Russia, on the Sula river, 112 miles to the north-west of Poltava, and in the government of that name. It acquired commercial importance during last century, especially on account of its fairs. The chief of these—that in wool—was removed to Poltava in 1852, but the prices established by the remaining three still determine to a great extent those at the greater fair of Poltava. Of the local industries, the manufacture of agricultural implements is the only one worthy of mention, but the petty trades, both in town and district, are of considerable importance. The population in 1881 was 12,300.</p>
