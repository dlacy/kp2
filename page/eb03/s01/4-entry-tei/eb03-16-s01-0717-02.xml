in ichthyology, a genus belonging to the order of thoracici. The bead is large and ſharp; the eyes are near each other; there are teeth in the jaws, palate, and fauces; and there are ſeven rays in the membrane of the gill. The ſpecies are three, viz. the <hi rend="italic">porcus, ſcrofa,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">horrida.</hi> According to Mr Willoughby, the ſcorpaena is a fiſh of the anguilliform kind, called by the people of Cornwall f <hi rend="italic">ather-laſher. Scorpaena</hi> is alſo the name of a fiſh caught in many parts of the Mediterranean. It ſeldom grows to more than a pound weight. Its body is long, but not flatted, and is moderately thick. Its head is extremely large, and is armed with prickles, and it grows gradually leſs from thence to the tail. The prickles about the head are accounted venomous, and the fishermen uſually cut them off as ſoon as the fiſh is caught. Its tail is not forked, but rounded at the end. The belly and belly-fins are reddiſh.</p><p><note anchored="false" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Plate CCCC</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> xlv.</hi></p></note> SCORPIO, in zoology, a genus of infects belonging to the order of aptera. It has eight feet, beſides two frontal claws; the eyes are eight in number, three on each fide of the thorax, and two on the back. It has two claw-ſhaped palpi, a long jointed tail, with a pointed weapon at the extremity; it has likewiſe two combs ſituated betwixt the breaſt and abdomen. There are ſix ſpecies, all natives of ſouthern climates.</p><p>Of all the claſſes of noxious inſects the ſcorpion is the moſt terrible, whoſe ſhape is hideous, whoſe ſize among the infects is enormous, and whoſe ſting is generally fatal. Happy for Britain, the ſcorpion is entirely a ſtranger among us! In ſeveral parts of the continent of Europe it is but too well known, though it ſeldom grows above four inches long: but in the warm tropical climates, it is ſeen a foot in length, and in every reſpect as large as a lobſter, which it ſomewhat reſembles in ſhape. There have been enumerated nine different kinds of this dangerous infect, including ſpecies and varieties, chiefly diſtinguiſhed by their colour; there being scorpions yellow, brown, and aſh-coloured; others that are the colour of ruſty iron, green, pale yellow, black, claret colour, white, and grey. There are four principal parts diſtinguiſhable in this animal; the head, the breaſt, the belly, and the tail. The ſcorpion’s head ſeems, as it were, jointed to the breaſt; in the middle of which are ſeen two eyes; and a little more forward, two eyes more, placed in the fore part of the head: thoſe eyes are ſo ſmall, that they are ſcarcely perceivable; and it is probable the animal has but little occaſiion for feeing. The mouth is furniſhed with two jaws: the undermoſt is divided into two, and the parts notched into each other, which ſerves the animal as teeth, and with which it breaks its food, and thruſts it into its mouth: theſe the ſcorpion can at pleaſure pull back into its mouth, ſo that no part of them can be ſeen. On each ſide of the head are two arms, each compoſed of four joints; the laſt of which is large, with ſtrong muſcles, and made in the manner of a lobſter’s claw. Below the breaſt are eight articulated legs, each divided into ſix joints; the two hind- moſt of which are each provided with two crooked claws, and here and there covered with hair. The belly is divided into ſeven little rings; from the loweſt</p><p>of which is continued a tail, compoſed of ſix joints, which are briſtly, and formed like little globes, the laſt being armed with a crooked ſting. This is that fatal inſtrument which renders this infect ſo formidable: it is long, pointed, hard, and hollow; it is pierced near the baſe by two ſmall holes, through which, when the animal ſtings, it ejects a drop of poiſon, which is white, cauſtic, and fatal. The reſervoir in which this poiſon is kept, is in a ſmall bladder near the tail, into which the venom is diſtilled by a peculiar apparatus. If this bladder be greatly preſſed, the venom will be ſeen iſſuing out through the two holes above-mentioned; ſo that it appears, that when the animal ſtings, the bladder is preſſed, and the venom iſſues through the two apertures into the wound.</p><p>We have here given the common account of the ſting of theſe noxious animals; but though we cannot pretend to determine between them, we ſhall lay before our readers the following obſervations from a treatiſe on <hi rend="italic">Tropical Diſeaſes,</hi> &amp;c. by Dr Moſeley of the Chelſea Hoſpital. “Galen juſtly obſerves, that a perſon who had not witneſſed the fact, would not ſuppoſe that ſo ſmall an injury as the ſting of a ſcorpion, or the bite of a poiſonous ſpider, could produce the violent effects which they do in the whole body. He ſays, the aculeus, or ſting, of a ſcorpion ends in the minuteſt point; and has no perforation through which any poiſon can paſs into the wound. Yet, he ſays, we muſt ſuppoſe the venom to be ſome ſpirital ſubſtance, or moiſture, in which a great power is concentrated in a ſmall compaſs. Before I had an opportunity (ſays Dr Moſeley) of examining this ſubject, my reſpect for the opinion of Galen made me doubt the accuracy of Leeuwenhoek, Redi, Mead, and others, who aſſert that there is an aperture near the cuſpis of a ſcorpion’s ſting; and that through this aperture a liquid poiſon is injected when a wound is inflicted. Repeated experiments, with the beſt glaſſes, have never enabled me to diſcover any foramen, or opening, whatever. ”</p><p>The following cure may alſo be worth the reader’s notice. “Mrs Pidgeley, at Kingſton in Jamaica, in January 1781, was ſtung by a ſcorpion in the foot, above the little toe. The part became inſtantly red and painful; and ſoon after livid. The pain increaſed to great ſeverity. Some rum was applied to the wound, on when the pain immediately left the foot, and paſſed up to the groin, with great agony. The pain ſtill paſſed upwards, and diffuſed itſelf about the pit of the ſtomach, neck, and throat, attended with tremors, cold ſweats, and languors. As the pain paſſed the abdomen, it occaſioned a violent purging and fainting, which ceaſed on its advancing higher.

whom it reſides. In ſome of the towns of Italy, and in France, in the province of Languedoc, it is one of the greateſt peſts that torments mankind: but its malignity in Europe is trifling, when compared to what the natives of Africa and the eaſt are known to experience. In Batavia, where they grow twelve inches long, there is no removing any piece of furniture, without the utmoſt danger of being ſ <hi rend="italic">t</hi> ung by them. Boſman aſſures us, that along the Gold Coaſt they are often found larger than a lobſter; and that their ſting is inevitably fatal. In Europe, however, they are by no means ſo large, ſo venomous, or ſo numerous. The general ſize of this animal does not exceed two or three inches; and its ſting is very ſeldom found to be fatal. Maupertius, who made ſeveral experiments on the ſcorpion of Languedoc, found it by no means ſo invariably dangerous as had till then been repreſented. He provoked one of them to ſting a dog, in three places of the belly where the animal was without hair. In about an hour after, the poor animal ſeemed greatly swollen, and became very sick: he then call up whatever he had in his bowels; and for about three hours continued vomiting a whitiſh liquid. The belly was always greatly ſwollen when the animal began to vomit; but this operation always ſeemed to abate the ſwelling; which alternately ſwelled, and was thus emptied, for three hours ſucceſſively. The poor animal after this fell into convulſions, bit the ground, dragged himſelf along upon his fore-feet, and at laſt died, five hours after being bitten. He was not partially ſwollen round the place which was bitten, as is uſual after the ſting of a waſp or a bee; but his whole body was inflated, and there only appeared a red ſpot on the places where he had been ſtung.</p><p>Some days after, however, the ſame experiment was tried upon another dog, and even with more aggravated cruelty: yet the dog ſeemed no way affected by the wounds: but, howling a little when he received them, continued alert and well after them; and ſoon after was ſet at liberty, without ſhowing the ſmalleſt ſymptoms of pain. So far was this poor creature from being terrified at the experiment, that he left his own maſter’s houſe, to come to that of the philoſopher, where he had received more plentiful entertainment. The ſame experiment was tried by freſh ſcorpions upon ſeven other dogs, and upon three hens; but not the ſmalleſt deadly ſymptom was ſeen to enſue. From hence it appears, that many circumſtances, which are utterly unknown, muſt contribute to give efficacy to the ſcorpion’s venom. Whether its food, long faſting, the ſeaſon, the nature of the veſſels it wounds, or its ſtate of maturity, contribute to or retard its malignity, is yet to be aſcertained by ſucceeding experiment. In the trials made by our philoſopher, he employed ſcorpions of both ſexes, newly caught, and ſeemingly vigorous and active. The ſucceſs of this experiment may ſerve to ſhew, that many of thoſe boaſted antidotes which are given for the cure of the ſcorpion’s ſting, owe their ſucceſs rather to accident than their own efficacy. They only happened to cure when their ſting was no way dangerous; but in caſes of actual malignity, they might probably be utterly unſerviceable</p><p>The ſcorpion of the tropical climates being much larger than the former is probably much more venomous. Helbigius, however, who reſided for many years</p><p>in the eaſt, aſſures us, that he was often ſtung by the ſcorpion, and never received any material injury from the wound: a painful tumor generally enſued; but he always cured it by rubbing the part with a piece of iron or ſtone, as he had ſeen the Indians practiſe before him, until the fleſh became inſenſible. Seba, Moore, and Boſman, however, give a very different account of the ſcorpion’s malignity: and aſſert, that, unleſs ſpeedily relieved, the wound becomes fatal.</p><p>It is certain, that no animal in the creation ſeems endued with ſuch an iraſcible nature. They have often been ſeen, when taken and put into a place of ſecurity, to exert all their rage againſt the ſides of the glaſs-veſſel that contained them. They will attempt to ſting a ſtick when put near them; and attack a mouſe or a frog, while thoſe animals are far from offering any injury. Maupertius put three ſcorpions and a mouſe into the ſame veſſel together, and they ſoon ſtung the little animal in different places. The mouſe, thus aſſaulted, ſtood for ſome time upon the defenſive, and at laſt killed them all, one after another. He tried this experiment, in order to ſee whether the mouſe, after it had killed, would eat the ſcorpions; but the little quadruped ſeemed ſatisfied with the victory, and even ſurvived the ſeverity of the wounds it had received. Wolkamer tried the courage of the ſcorpion againſt the large ſpider, and incloſed ſeveral of both kinds in glaſs veſſels for that purpoſe. The ſucceſs of this combat was very remarkable. The ſpider at firſt uſed all its efforts to intangle the ſcorpion in its web, which it immediately began ſpinning; but the ſcorpion reſcued itſelf from the danger, by ſtinging its adverſary to death: it ſoon after cut off, with its claws, all the legs of the ſpider, and then ſucked all the internal parts at its leiſure. — If the ſcorpion’s ſkin had not been ſo hard, Wolkamer is of opinion that the ſpider would have obtained the victory; for he had often ſeen one of theſe ſpiders deſtroy a toad.</p><p>The fierce ſpirit of this animal is equally dangerous to its own ſpecies; for ſcorpions are the cruelleſt enemies to each other. Maupertius put about 100 of them together in the ſame glaſs; and they ſcarce came into contact when they began to exert all their rage in mutual deſtruction: there was nothing to be ſeen but one univerſal carnage, without any diſtinction of age or ſex; ſo that in a few days there remained only 14, which had killed and devoured all the reft.</p><p>But their unnatural malignity is ſtill more apparent in their cruelty to their offspring. He incloſed a female ſcorpion, big with young, in a glaſs veſſel, and ſhe was ſeen to devour them as faſt as they were excluded: there was but one only of the number that eſcaped the general deſtruction, by taking refuge on the back of its parent; and this ſoon after revenged the cauſe of its brethren, by killing the old one in its turn.</p><p>Such is the terrible and unrelenting nature of this inſect, which neither the bonds of ſociety nor of nature can reclaim: it is even aſſerted, that, when driven to an extremity, the ſcorpion will often deſtroy itſelf. The following experiment was ineffectually tried by Maupertius: "But, " ſays Mr Goldſmith, “I am ſo well aſſured of it by many eye-witneſſes, who have ſeen it both in Italy and America, that I have no doubt remaining of its veracity. A ſcorpion, newly caught,<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0725.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0719"/>
is placed in the midſt of a circle of burning charcoal, and thus an egreſs prevented on every ſide: the ſcorpion, as I am aſſured, runs for about a minute round the circle, in hopes of eſcaping: but finding that i- poſſible, it ſtings itſelſ on the back of the head; and in this manner the undaunted ſuicide inſtantly expires. ”</p><p>It is happy for mankind that theſe animals are thus deſtructive to each other; ſince otherwiſe they would multiply in ſo great a degree as to render ſome countries uninhabitable. The male and female of this infect are very eaſily diſtinguiſhable; the male being ſmaller and leſs hairy. The female brings forth her young alive, and perfect in their kind. Redi having bought a quantity of ſcorpions, ſelected the females, which, by their ſize and roughneſs, were eaſily diſtinguiſhable from the reſt, and putting them in ſeparate glaſs veſſels, he kept them for ſome days without food. In about five days one of them brought forth 38 young ones, well-ſhaped, and of a milk-white colour, which changed every day more and more into a dark ruſty hue. Another female, in a different veſſel, brought forth 27 of the ſame colour; and the day following the young ones ſeemed all fixed to the back and belly of the female. For near a fortnight all theſe continued alive and well: but afterwards ſome of them died daily; until, in about a month, they all died except two.</p><p>Were it worth the trouble, theſe animals, might be kept living as long as curioſity ſhould think proper. Their chief food is worms and infects; and upon a proper ſupply of theſe, their lives might be lengthened to their natural extent. How long that may be, we are not told; but if we may argue from analogy, it cannot be leſs than ſeven or eight years; and perhaps, in the larger kind, double that duration. As they have ſomewhat the form of the lobſter, ſo they reſemble that animal in caſting their ſhell, or more properly their ſkin; ſince it is softer by far than the covering of the lobſter, and ſet with hairs, which grow from it in great abundance, particularly at the joinings. The young lie in the womb of the parent, each covered up in its own membrane, to the number of 40 or 50, and united to each other by an oblong thread, ſo as to exhibit altogether the form of a chaplet.</p><p>Such is the manner in which the common ſcorpion produces its young: but there is a ſcorpion of America produced from the egg, in the manner of the ſpider. The eggs are no longer than pins points; and they are depoſited in a web, which they ſpin from their bodies, and carry about with them, till they are hatched. As ſoon as the young ones are excluded from the ſhell, they get upon the back of the parent, who turns her tail over them, and defends them with her ſting. It ſeems probable, therefore, that captivity produces that unnatural diſpoſition in the ſcorpion which induces it to deſtroy its young; ſince, at liberty, it is found to protect them with ſuch unceaſing aſſiduity. For the various modes of preventing the fatal conſequences of the bites of theſe and other noxious animals, we refer to Moſeley’s treatiſe above quoted.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scorpio,</hi> <hi rend="italic">Scorpion,</hi> in aſtronomy, the eighth ſign of the zodiac denoted by the character m.
