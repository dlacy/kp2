The secret of his success lay unquestionably in that predominant quality which, difficult or impossible of analysis, but instinctively felt by his readers, while they are carried along on his irresistible current of thought and feeling, the ancients called his vehemence <hi rend="italic">(inviτηf),—</hi>that strong firmness of soul with which he threw himself upon his subject, grasping its details in all their relations, forcing them to support him as he hurried towards the end which lay before him, and kindling them, by the flashes of his imagination and passion, into lights which illuminated his headlong course. Dionysius, one of his best critics,—who analyses his style into a combination of all those which had preceded, uniting, in particular, the austerity of the early orators and historians with the polish of the later,—describes the effects of his orations upon the feelings, when compared with that which is produced by such compositions as those of Isocrates, by saying that the latter leave us in the same contemplative mood as if we had been listening to strains of exquisite music, while the former inspire us by turns with all the passions incident to humanity, and with an agitation as fierce as that which raged among the initiated during the celebration of the mystic rites of Cybele. And yet the man who, by stamping upon his subject the impress of his own vigorous and impassioned mind, has made himself thus eloquent in the very loftiest sense which the word can bear, attained this high excellence and unchallenged fame by a course of self-training the most severe that is on record, and, after all his exertions, wanted altogether many of those lesser attractions, both of matter and of style, which have of themselves been sufficient to establish the fame of meaner orators. A writer in the Edinburgh Review in 1820, whose hand is easily recognisable as the same which annexed the Dissertation on the Eloquence of the Ancients to the collected edition of Lord Brougham’s speeches, has not one whit overstated the amount of Demosthenes’s deficiencies, in describing him as having gained his ascendancy “ without any ostentation of profound reflection or philosophical remark—with few attempts at generalization—without the glare and attraction of prominent ornaments—with extremely few, and those not very successful, instances of the tender and pathetic—with a considerable degree of coarseness, and what we should call vulgarity—and absolutely without any pretension to wit or humour.” “ Could the manner of Demosthenes be copied,” says David Hume, with an unusual w<hi rend="sup">τ</hi>armth of commendation, “ its success would be infallible over a modern assembly. It is rapid harmony exactly adjusted to the sense ; it is vehement reasoning, without any appearance of art ; it is disdain, anger, boldness, freedom, involved in a continued stream of argument ; and, of all human productions, the orations of Demosthenes present to us the models which approach the nearest to perfection.”</p><p>It would be easy, if our limits allowed us, to indicate, in every one of the political orations of Demosthenes, instances illustrating his favourite and characteristic methods of influencing his hearers ;—his striking and lively narratives of interesting facts, like the scene at Athens on the taking of Elatea, painted in the oration for the Crown ;—the happy illustrations from familiar life which abound everywhere ;— the metaphors few and brief, and effective in proportion to their briefness and rarity, like the example in the first Philippic, where Philip is represented as a hunter, and the Athenians as his prey lying quietly within the toils ;—those tremendous invectives launched by turns against Philip and his Athenian partisans ;—those apparently unpremeditated bursts of feeling, in which every strong emotion, personal or political, in the minds of the audience, is awakened by an honest, indignant, conversational remonstrance,—a class of appeals exemplified in the celebrated reproach to the Athenians for their newsmonging indolence, while events the most extraordinary were summoning them loudly to action (introduced originally in the first Philippic, and again more briefly in the speech on Philip’s Letter);—and those grandest and most sustained flights of all, in which the nationality of Greece, and of Attica, the proudest tribe of Grecians, is at once aroused and flattered by the most dramatic exhibitions of their ancient glory and greatness. For those who wish to see most of the orator’s characteristics developed within a moderate compass, none of the orations perhaps is better suited than the third Philippic. His favourite paradoxical argument, that the utter wretchedness of the Athenian affairs at that juncture, caused, as it had been, by their own shameful inactivity, gave them truly the best reason to hope for success on a change of measures,—is followed by an argument, not unlike Canning’s in 1826 for the war with Spain, in which the speaker maintains that peace is unattainable from the position and character of the enemy, whose treachery is exemplified in a style of the most powerful irony: the arbitrary government of Philip, and its results, are set in strong contrast to the nature and consequences of the liberal supremacy which Athens, Sparta, and Thebes, had by turns exercised over the free states of Greece : a bitterly contemptuous simile, the celebrated one of the heir and the slave, introduces a noble parallel between ancient honesty and modern corruption : the story of Euphraeus adds individual interest to the general picture of the misusage of the Greeks by Philip, which receives its finishing touches in the indignantly sarcastic description of the fate which had befallen Philip’s submissive victims, the men of Oreum and Eretria: and the brief practical Summary of advices which closes the speech is ushered in by a declaration which the speaker thunders in the ears of tbe Athenian people, with the majesty of a king commanding his subjects—that if all mankind should consent to be slaves, the struggle for liberty must still be maintained by them, who of old had been so proudly illustrious and free.</p><p>But both Demosthenes and Æschines may be studied to most advantage in the extant orations delivered by each of them on two occasions, in which their personal character and fortunes were at stake. The former of the two was that on which Demosthenes impeached his rival for corruption and misconduct in the famous Embassy to Philip. His speech in support of the accusation is as characteristic as any of his which we possess, and, while it abounds with his other excellencies, is particularly happy in its wealth of picturesque and pointed incident ; Philip’s oath in the tavern, the anecdote of Satyrus, the supper of Phaidimos, and the melancholy group of the Olynthian prisoners, being singularly beautiful examples of this kind. The answer of Æschines is yet finer, being, indeed, the acknowledged masterpiece of that, most skilful and eloquent orator, whose fame, but, for the overshadowing neighbourhood of his immortal rival, would have grown up higher and more widely than that of any other public speaker of the ancient world. But these two orations on the β-α^αiΓfsi⅛ι∕α, as they are usually called, are not so well fitted to become rhetorical exercises</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
