a town of the county of Sussex, in the rape of Brember and hundred of Fishergate, fifty-six miles from London. It stands on the river Adar, about a mile from the sea, and has a bridge over that river, It has a custom-house, which presides over that at Brighton. The harbour is not deep, but useful as shelter, when the wind is high, for vessels unloading on the beach at Brighton, although there is scarcely any water when the tide is out. It is an ancient place, ill built, with few good houses. The church is old, and was originally monastic. It is a borough, which, on account of bribery in 1771, was extended, to comprehend all the forty shilling freeholders of the rape on which it stands, and still continues to elect two members to the House of Commons. There is some trade in building ships, and a considerable oyster fishery. A market, well supplied, is also held on Saturday. The population was, in 1801, 987 ; in 1811, 980; in 1821, 1282; and in 1831, 1734.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
