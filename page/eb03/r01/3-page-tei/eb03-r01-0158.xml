In doing this, however, he pretends not to deny that theſe images appear to be real ; but candidly .acknowledges that</p><p>---They ſtrike and ſhake</p><p>The airy ſoul, as when we are awake, with ſtroke fo lively, that we think we view The abſent dead, and think the image true.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Creech.</hi></p><p>we here ſee how the belief of the foul’s immortality came to be general among mankind. But for this information we are much more indebted to the poets, who have given us faithful tranſcripts of nature, than to the philoſophers who have wiſhed to entertain us with their own theories, or to thoſe laborious men ot erudition, who have dreaded as much to examine the ſource of an ancient report as the friends of Ulyſſes to approach the coaſt of Cimmerian darknefs. with them tradition is the ultimate boundary of reſearch : and as gorgons, chimeras, and hydras, have come down to us by tradition ; ſo they, with great ſagacity, ſuſ pect, that tradition muſt likewiſe be at the bottom of the ſoul’s immortality, and occaſion the viſions and phantoms of the dead.</p><p>To tradition we have allowed all that it can juſtly claim ; but we cannot allow it to be the only ſource of this opinion : -and we have felt the higheſt indignation upon hearing men of learning and genius affirm, from a ſalſe zeal for the honour of revelation, that mankind, without this inſtruction, could never have acquired the art of building huts to ſcreen them from the cold, ©r have learned the method of propagating their ſpecies ! The reader muſt not here fuppoſe that we allude to Polydore virgil (b). λVe have in our eye perſons now alive, with whom we have converged on the ſubject, and who (terrifiedat the length to which ſome philoſophers have carried the doctrine of inſtincts, and others the reaſoning powers of the mind) have contended, with the utmoſt earneſtnefs, that we know nothing—not even the functions of our animal nature—but by tradition or written revelation.</p><p>Having now ſeen the ſource of the opinion concerning the future exiſtence of the ſoul, and pointed out the natural phenomena by which mankind were led to embrace it, we come next to review the arguments by which the philoſophers attempted to confirm it.</p><p>Pythagoras believed, with the reſt of his country, that annihilation was never the end, and that nonentity was never the beginning, of any thing that is. His general doctrine upon this ſubject was ſhortly expreſſed in very few words, <hi rend="italic">Omnia mutantur, nihil interit.</hi>  He afterwards learned from Egyptian prieſts that the foul migrates into new bodies ; and being, it ſeems, a perſon of a moſt extraordinary and aſtoniſhing memory, he found there was ſome truth in the ſtory: for after muſing, he began to remember that he was Euphorbus, the ion, of Pan-theus, that was ſiain by Menelaus in the Trojan war ; and upon a jaunt to Peloponneſus, recollected the ſhield which he had worn at the time of the ſiege, in o⅛ne of the temples of Juno at Argos ! That none might queſtion the truth of his aſſertion, his followers preſently removed all doubts by the famous argument, the ipse dixit of Egyptian origin.</p><p>As Pythagoras taught that human ſouls are frequent-ly thruſt into brute ſhapes, and, as ſome imagined, by way of puniſhment; it occurred to Plato, that all bodies, even the human, are a fort of priſons ; and that, in confequence of this confinement, the foul was ſubjected to the rage of deſire, appetite, and paffion, and to all the wretched miſeries of a jail. To explain this my-ſtery, he fuppoſed that deſires and appetites belong to a foul that is purely animal reſiding in the body. But he was perplexed with another difficulty ; for as he thought highly of the goodnefs of Deity, he could not imagine how he ſhould imprifon us without a crime. He ſuppoſed, therefore, that prior to its union with the preſent body the foul had exiſted in one of ether, which it ſtill retains; but that even in this etherialbody it had felt ſomething of impure deſire ; and happening to indulge the vicious appetite, had contracted ſome ſtains of pollution, for which it was confined in its preſent body as a houſe of correction to do penance and improve its morals.</p><p>To prove this ideal pre-exiſtence of the foul, Plato availed himfelf of an opinion that was general in his time, that coincided with the doctrines of Pythagoras, and that was partly founded on a fort of reaſoning and obfervation. He thought that matter and intelligence are coeternal (fee Platonism.) ; that there are various orders of ſouls ; that thoſe of both the man and the brute are parts or emanations (c) of the <hi rend="italic">anima rnundj<hi rend="sub">i </hi></hi>  or ſoul of the world ; that all are ultimately parts or emanations of Deity itſelf ; and that all their faculties are more or lefs reſtricted and confined, according to thoſe organiſed ſyſtems with which they are connected. Know firſt (ſays one delivering his doctrines),</p><p>Know firſt, that heav’n and earth’s compacted frame,.</p><p>And flowing waters, and the ſtarry flame,</p><p>And both the radiant lights, one common ſoul</p><p>Inſpires, and feeds, and animates, the whole.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(b)</hi>     This writer allots part of a chapter to (how, " Quis primum inſtituerit artem meretriciam,” as being, ■in his opinion, a traditionary practice.
