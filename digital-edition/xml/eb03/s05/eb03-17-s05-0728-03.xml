(Dr William), known to the public by a volume containing <hi rend="italic">Clinical and Anatomical Obſervations,</hi> with ſome curious <hi rend="italic">Experiments on Diet,</hi> was born at Mancheſter in the month of July 1740; but the family from which he ſprang was Scotch, and reſpectable for its antiquity. His grandfather John Stark of Killermont was a covenanter ; and having appeared in arms againſt his ſovereign at the battle of Bothwell bridge in the year 1679, became obnoxious to the government, and to conceal himſelf, withdrew into Ireland. There is reason to believe that he had not imbibed either the extravagant zeal or the ſavage manners of the political and religious party to which he adhered ; for after reſiding a few years in the country which he had choſen for the ſcene of his baniſhment, he married Elizabeth daughter of Thomas Stewart Eſq; of Balydrene in the north of Ireland ; who, being deſcended of the noble family of Galloway, would not probably have matched his daughter to ſuch an exile as a ruthleſs fanatic of the laſt century. By this lady Mr Stark had ſeveral children ; and his ſecond ſon Thomas, who settled at Mancheſter as a wholeſale linen-draper, and married Margaret Stirling, daughter of William Stirling, Eſq; of Northwoodſide, in the neighbourhood of Glaſgow, was the father of the ſubject of this article. Another of his ſons, the reverend John Stark, was miniſter of Lecropt in Perthshire ; and it was under the care of this gentleman that our author received the rudiments of his education, which, when we conſider the character of the maſter, and reflect on the relation between him and his pupil, we may preſume was calculated to ſtore the mind of Dr Stark with thoſe virtuous principles which influenced his conduct through life.</p><p>From Lecropt young Stark was sent to the univerſity of Glaſgow, where, under the tuition of the Doctors Smith and Black, with other eminent maſters, he learned the rudiments of ſcience, and acquired that mathematical accuracy, that logical preciſion, and that contempt of hypotheſes, with which he proſecuted all his future ſtudies. Having choſen phyſic for his profeſſion, he removed from the univerſity of Glaſgow to that of Edinburgh, where he was ſoon diſtinguiſhed, and honoured with the friendſhip of the late Dr Cullen ; a man who was not more eminently conſpicuous for the superiority of his own genius, than quick-ſighted in perceiving, and liberal in encouraging, genius in his pupils. Having finiſhed his ſtudies at Edinburgh, though he took there no degree, Mr Stark, in the year 1765, went to London, and devoted himſelf entirely to the ſtudy of phyſic and the elements of ſurgery ; and looking upon anatomy as one of the principal pillars of both theſe arts, he endeavoured to complete with Dr Hunter what he had begun with Dr Monro ; and under theſe two eminent profeſſors he appears to have acquired a high degree of anatomical knowledge. He likewiſe entered himſelf about this time a pupil at St George’s hoſpital ; for being diſguſted, as he often confeſſed, with the inaccuracy or want of candour obſervable in the generality of practical writers, he determined to obtain an acquaintance with diſeaſes at a better ſchool and from an abler maſter ; and to have from his own experience a ſtandard, by which he might judge of the ex-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0735.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0729"/>
perience of others. With what induſtry he proſecuted this plan, and with what ſucceſs his labours were crowned, may be ſeen in a ſeries of <hi rend="italic">Clinical and Anatomical Observatiοns,</hi> which were made by him during his attendance at the hoſpital, and were publiſhed after his death by his friend Dr Carmichael Smyth. Theſe obſervations give the public no cauſe to complain of want of candour in their author ; for whatever delicacy he may have obſerved, when relating the cases of patients treated by other phyſicians, he has related thoſe treated by himſelf with the utmoſt impartiality. Whilſt attending the hoſpital, he likewiſe employed himſelf in making experiments on the blood, and other animal fluids ; and alſo in a courſe of experiments in chemical pharmacy ; but though accounts of theſe experiments were left behind him, we believe they have not yet been given to the public.</p><p>In the year 1767 Mr Stark went abroad and obtained the degree of M. D. in the university of Leyden, publiſhing an inaugural diſſertation on the dyſentery. On his return to London, he recommenced his ſtudies at the hoſpital ; and when Ur Black was called to the chemical chair in Edinburgh, which he has long filled with ſo much honour to himſelf and credit to the univerſity, Dr Stark was solicited by ſeveral members of the univerſity of Glaſgow to ſtand a candidate for their profeſſorſhip of the theory and practice of phyſic, rendered vacant by Dr Black’s removal to Edinburgh. This however Dr Stark declined, being influenced by the advice of his Engliſh friends, who wiſhed to detain him in London, and having likewiſe ſome prospects of an appointment in the hoſpital.</p><p>In the mean time he had commenced (1769) a ſeries of experiments on diet, which he was encouraged to undertake by Sir John Pringle and Dr Franklin, whoſe friendſhip he enjoyed, and from whom he received many hints reſpecting both the plan and its execution. Theſe experiments, or rather the imprudent zeal with which he proſecuted them, proved in the opinion of his friends, fatal to himſelf ; for he began them on the 12th of July 1669 in perfect health and vigour, and from that day, though his health varied, it was ſeldom if ever good, till the 23d of February 1770, when he died, after ſuffering much uneaſineſs. His friend and biographer Dr Smyth thinks, that other cauſes, particularly chagrin and diſappointment, had no ſmall share in haſtening his death ; and as the Doctor was intimately acquainted with his character and diſpoſition, his opinion is probably well-founded, though the pernicious effects of the experiments are viſible in Dr Stark’s own journal. When he entered upon them, the weight of his body was 12 ſtone 3 lb. avoirdupois, which in a very few days was reduced to 11 ſtone 10 lb 8 oz: and though ſome kinds of food increaſed it, by much the greater part of what he uſed had a contrary effect, and it continued on the whole to decreaſe till the day of his death. This indeed can excite no wonder. Though the profeſſed object of his experiments was to prove that a <hi rend="italic">pleaſant</hi> and varied diet is equally conducive to health with a more ſtrict and simple one, moſt of the diſhes which he ate during theſe experiments were neither pleaſant nor simple, but compounds, ſuch as every ſtomach muſt nauſeate. He began with <hi rend="italic">bread</hi> and <hi rend="italic">water ;</hi> from which he proceeded to <hi rend="italic">bread, water,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ſugar</hi>; then to <hi rend="italic">bread, water,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">oil of olives ;</hi> then to <hi rend="italic">bread</hi> and <hi rend="italic">water</hi> with</p><p><hi rend="italic">milk ;</hi> afterwards he tried <hi rend="italic">bread</hi> and <hi rend="italic">water</hi> with <hi rend="italic">roasted goose ; bread</hi> and <hi rend="italic">water</hi> with <hi rend="italic">boiled beef ; stewed lean of beef</hi> with the <hi rend="italic">gravy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">water</hi> without bread ; st <hi rend="italic">ewed lean of beeſ</hi> with the <hi rend="italic">gravy, oil</hi> of <hi rend="italic">fat</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ſuet</hi> and <hi rend="italic">water ; flour, oil of ſuet, water</hi> and sal <hi rend="italic">t ; flour, water,</hi> and sal <hi rend="italic">t ;</hi> and a number of others infinitely more diſagreeable to the ſtomach than even theſe, ſuch as <hi rend="italic">bread, fat of bacon ham, infusion of tea</hi> with <hi rend="italic">ſugar ;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bread</hi> or <hi rend="italic">flour</hi> with <hi rend="italic">honey</hi> and the infuſion of <hi rend="italic">rofemary.</hi> But though we conſider Dr Stark’s experiments as whimſical, it cannot be denied that they indicate eccentricity of genius in the perſon who made them ; and ſuch of our readers as think genius hereditary, may perhaps be of opinion, that he derived a ray from the celebrated <hi rend="smallcaps">Napier</hi> the inventor of the logarithms, who was his anceſtor by both parents. At any rate, theſe experiments, of which a full account is given in the ſame volume with his clinical and anatomical obſervations, diſplay an uncommon degree of fortitude, perſeverance, self-denial, and zeal for the promoting of uſeful knowledge in their author ; and with reſpect to his moral character, we believe it is with great juſtice that Dr Smyth compares him to Cato by applying to him what was ſaid of that virtuous Roman by Salluſt.—“ Non divitiis cum divite, neque factione cum factioſo; ſed cum ſtrenuo virtute, cum modeſto pudore, cum innocente abſtinentia certabat ; esse, quam videri, bonus malebat<note anchored="true" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Bellum Catilinarium.</p></note> *."</p></div></body></text></TEI>
