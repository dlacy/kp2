the act whereby we perceive smells, or whereby we become ſensible of odorous bodies, by means of certain effluvia thereof ; which, ſtriking on the olfactory organ, briſkly enough to have their impulſe propagated to the brain, excite a ſenſation in the soul. The principal organs of ſmelling are the noſtrils and the olfactory nerves ; the minute ramifications of which latter are diſtributed throughout the whole concave oſ the former. For their deſcriptions, ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy.</hi></p><p>Smelling is performed by drawing into the noſtrils the odorous effluvia floating in the air in inspiration, which strike with ſuch force against the fibrillæ of the olfactory nerves, which the figure of the noſe, and the ſituation of the little bones, render oppoſite thereto, as to ſhake them, and give them a vibratory motion ; which action, being communicated hence to the common ſensory, occaſions an idea of a ſweet, or fetid, or four, or an aromatic, or a putrefied object, &amp; c. The matter in animals, vegetables, foſſils, &amp; c. which chiefly affects the ſenſe of ſmelling, Boerhaave obſerves, is that ſubtile ſubſtance, inherent in their oily parts,<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0550.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0544"/>
called spirits : becauſe, when this is taken away from the moſt fragrant bodies, what remains has ſcarce any ſmell at all ; but this, poured on the moſt inodorous bodies, gives them a fragrancy.</p><p>Willis obſerves, that brutes have generally the ſenſe of ſmelling in much greater perfection than man : by this alone they diſtinguiſh the qualities of bodies, which could not otherwiſe be known; hunt out their food at a great diſtance, as hounds and birds of prey ; or hid among other ſubſtances, as ducks, &amp; c. Man, having other means of judging of his food, &amp; c. did not need ſo much ſagacity in his noſe ; yet have we inſtances of a great deal even in man. In the <hi rend="italic">Histoire des Antilles,</hi> we are affured there are negroes who, by the ſmell alone, can diſtinguiſh between the footſteps of a Frenchman and a negro. It is found, that the laminae, wherewith the upper part of the noſtrils is fenced, and which ſerve to receive the divarications of the olfactory nerves, are always longer, and folded up together in greater numbers, as the animal has this ſenſe more acute : the various windings and turnings of theſe laminæ detaining the odoriferous particles.</p><p>The ſenſe of ſmelling may be diminiſhed or deſtroy- cd by diſeaſes ; as by the moiſture, dryneſs, inflammation, or ſuppuration of the olfactory membrane, the compresſion of the nerves which ſupply it, or ſome fault in the brain itſelf at their origin. A defect, or too great a degree of ſolidity of the ſmall ſpongy bones of the upper jaw, the caverns of the forehead, &amp; c. may likewiſe impair this ſenſe ; and it may be alſo injured by a collection of fetid matter in theſe caverns, which is conti Dually exhaling from them, and alſo by immoderate uſe of ſnuff. When the noſe abounds with moiſture, after gentle evacuations, ſuch things as tend to take off irritation and coagulate the thin ſharp ſerum may be applied ; as the oil of aniſe mixed with fine flour, camphor diſſolved in oil of almonds, &amp; c. the vapours of amber, frankincenſe, gum-maſtic, and benjamin, may likewiſe be received into the noſe and mouth. For moiſtening the mucus when it is too dry, ſome recommend ſnuff made of the leaves of marjoram, mixed with oil of amber, marjoram, and aniſeed ; or a ſternutatory of calcined white vitriol, twelve grains of which may be mixed with two ounces of marjoram water and filtrated. The ſteam of vinegar upon hot iron, and received up the noſtrils, is alſo of uſe for ſoftening the mucus, removing obſtructions, &amp; c. If there be an ulcer in the noſe, it ought to be dreffed with ſome emollient ointment, to which, if the pain be very great, a little laudanum may be added. If it be a venereal ulcer, 12 grains of corroſive ſublimate may be diffolved in a pint and a half of brandy, a table ſpoonful of which may be taken twice a day. The ulcer ought likewiſe to be waſhed with it, and the fumes of cinnabar may be received up the noſtrils.</p><p>If there be reaſon to ſuſpect that the nerves which ſupply the organs of ſmelling are inert, or want ſtimulating, volatile ſalts, or ſtrong ſnuffs, and other things which occaſion ſneezing, may be applied to the noſe ; the forehead may likewiſe be anointed with balſam of Peru, to which may be added a little oil of amber.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
