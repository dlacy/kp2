<p><span class="font1">in 1847-1848, served as district judge in 1852-1857, and in 1857-1861 was a representative in Congress. His political&nbsp;views were determined by the ultra-democratic influence of&nbsp;Andrew Jackson and the state-sovereignty philosophy of John&nbsp;C. Calhoun. In 1861 he was a member of the Texas secession&nbsp;convention, served in the Confederate provisional Congress,&nbsp;and on the 6th of March was appointed postmaster-general in&nbsp;President Davis’s cabinet. He served in this capacity throughout the war, and for a short time before its close was also acting&nbsp;secretary of the treasury. He was captured with the Davis&nbsp;party on the 10th of May 1865, and was imprisoned in Fort&nbsp;Warren, Boston Harbour, until the following October. While&nbsp;in prison he wrote the “Fort Warren letter” (August 11th),&nbsp;in which he urged the people of Texas to recognize their defeat,&nbsp;grant civil rights to the freedmen, and try to conciliate the&nbsp;North. From 1875 to 1887, when he entered the U.S. Senate,&nbsp;he was again a representative in Congress, and from 1877 almost&nbsp;continuously to the close of his service he was chairman of the&nbsp;Committee on Commerce, in which capacity he had a prominent&nbsp;part in securing the passage of the Interstate Commerce Act of&nbsp;1887. He was a member of the state constitutional convention&nbsp;of 1876. In state politics his sympathies were with the Radicals.&nbsp;In 1891, believing that hĩs first duty was to his state, he resigned&nbsp;from the Senate to accept the chairmanship of the newly established state railway commission. In 1901 he retired from public&nbsp;service. From 1899 until his death he was president of the&nbsp;Texas State Historical Association. He died at his home, near&nbsp;Palestine, Texas, on the 6th of March 1905.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">REALGAR, a mineral species consisting of arsenic mono-sulphide (AsS) and occurring as monoclinic crystals of a bright red colour. There is a perfect cleavage parallel to the plane of&nbsp;symmetry (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font1"> in fig.). The lustre is resinous, and the streak&nbsp;has the same colour as the crystals,&nbsp;namely, orange-red to aurora-red. The&nbsp;hardness is 1½-2 and the specific gravity&nbsp;3∙55. On exposure to light the crystals&nbsp;crumble to a yellow powder. The name&nbsp;realgar is of Arabic origin, and was used&nbsp;by the alchemists; the substance was&nbsp;known to Theophrastus under the name&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Σαvδαράκη,</span><span class="font1"> and to Pliny as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sandaracha.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The mineral usually occurs in association&nbsp;with the yellow arsenic sulphide, orpiment. Good crystals are found with ores of silver and&nbsp;lead in the mineral veins of Felsöbánya, near Nagy-Bánya,&nbsp;Kapnik-Bánya and Nagyág, near Déva, in Hungary; with&nbsp;blende in the white crystalline dolomite of the BinnenthaI in&nbsp;Switzerland; and in a bed of sandy clay at Mercur in Utah. It&nbsp;is deposited by the solfataras near Naples and by the hot springs&nbsp;of the Yellowstone National Park. Realgar has been used as a&nbsp;pigment and in pyrotechny for producing a brilliant white fire;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">but it is now replaced by the artificially prepared compound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The other native arsenic sulphide, As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, known as orpiment (Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">auripigmentum,</span><span class="font1"> meaning “golden paint”), occurs as&nbsp;foliated masses of a lemon-yellow colour, the foliation being&nbsp;parallel to a direction of perfect cleavage. It is sectile and&nbsp;soft (H. = 1½-2), and has a specific gravity 3∙4. Distinctly&nbsp;developed crystals are rare; they have usually been considered&nbsp;to be orthorhombic and isomorphous with stibnite (Sb2S3), but&nbsp;it is probable that they are really monoclinic. Orpiment is extensively mined near Julamerk in Asiatic Turkey. (L. J. S.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REALISM (from Low Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">realis,</span><span class="font1"> appertaining to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res,</span><span class="font1"> things, as opposed to ideas and imaginations), a philosophical term used&nbsp;in two opposite senses. The older of these is the scholastic&nbsp;doctrine, traceable back to Socrates, that universals have&nbsp;a more “ real ” existence than things. Universals are, in&nbsp;scholastic language, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ante res, in rebus</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">post res.</span><span class="font1"> Behind all&nbsp;numerous types of chairs there is in the mind the ideal chair of&nbsp;which particular chairs are mere copies. In the most extreme&nbsp;form realism denies that anything exists in any sense except&nbsp;universals. It is opposed to nominalism </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font1"> and conceptualism&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font1"> For the history of the doctrine, see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Scholasticism.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Realism in this sense has been called “ an assertion of the&nbsp;rights of the subject ” (cf. the Protagonean maxim, “ Man is&nbsp;the measure of all things ”). The modem application of the&nbsp;term is to the opposing doctrine that there is a reality apart from&nbsp;its presentation to consciousness. In this sense it is opposed&nbsp;to idealism </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font1"> whether the purely subjective or that more&nbsp;comprehensive idealism which makes subject and object&nbsp;mutually interdependent. In its crude form it is known as&nbsp;“ Natural ’’ or “ Naive ” Realism. It appears, however, in&nbsp;more complex forms, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> as Ideal Realism (or Real Idealism),&nbsp;which combines epistemological idealism with realism in metaphysics. Again, Kant distinguishes “ empirical ” realism,&nbsp;which maintains the existence of things in space independent of&nbsp;consciousness, from “ transcendental ” realism, which ascribes&nbsp;absolute reality to time and space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In literature and art “ realism ” again is opposed to “ idealism” in various senses. The realist is (1) he who deliberately declines to select his subjects from the beautiful or harmonious,&nbsp;and, more especially, describes ugly things and brings out&nbsp;details of an unsavoury sort; (2) he who deals with individuals,&nbsp;not types; (3) most properly, he who strives to represent the&nbsp;facts exactly as they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REALM, the dominions of a king, a kingdom. The O.Fr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">reaume</span><span class="font1"> (mod. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">royaume)</span><span class="font1"> was the form first adopted in English,&nbsp;and the modem spelling does not appear fixed till the beginning of the 17th century. The word must be referred to a&nbsp;supposed hied. Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">regalimen,</span><span class="font1"> from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">regalis,</span><span class="font1"> of or belonging to&nbsp;a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rex,</span><span class="font1"> king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REAL PROPERTY. The land law of England and of countries whose law is based upon that of England stands in a peculiar&nbsp;position, which can be understood only by an outline of its&nbsp;history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History.—</span><span class="font1">Such terms as “ fee ” or “ homage ” carry us back into feudal times. Rights of common and distress are based&nbsp;upon still older institutions, forming the very basis of primitive&nbsp;law. The conception of tenure is the fundamental ground of&nbsp;distinction between real and personal estate, the former only&nbsp;being strictly entitled to the name of estate </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font1"> The division&nbsp;into real and personal is coincident to a great extent with that&nbsp;into immovable and movable, generally used by systems of&nbsp;law founded on the Roman (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Personal Property.)</span><span class="font1"> That it&nbsp;is not entirely coincident is due to the influence of the Roman&nbsp;law itself. The Greeks and the Romans of the republic were&nbsp;essentially nations of citizens; the Teutons were essentially&nbsp;a nation of land-folk; the Roman empire bridged the gulf&nbsp;between the two. It is probable that the English land law&nbsp;was produced by the action of the policy adopted in the lower&nbsp;empire, finally developed into feudalism, upon the previously&nbsp;existing course of Teutonic custom. The distinguishing features&nbsp;of the Teutonic system were enjoyment in common and the&nbsp;absence of private ownership, except to a limited extent. The&nbsp;principal features of the old English land law before the Conquest, from which the modern law has developed, were (1) liberty&nbsp;of alienation, either by will or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">inter vivos,</span><span class="font1"> of such land as could be&nbsp;alienated, chiefly, if not entirely, bocland, subject always to&nbsp;the limits fixed by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bοc;</span><span class="font1"> (2) publicity of transfer by enrolment&nbsp;in the shire-book or church-book; (3) equal partition of the&nbsp;estate of a deceased among the sons, and failing sons among&nbsp;the daughters; (4) cultivation to a great extent by persons&nbsp;in various degrees of serfdom, owing money or labour rents;&nbsp;(5) variety of custom, tending to become uniform, through the&nbsp;application of the same principles in the local courts; (6) subjection of land to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">trinoda necessitas,</span><span class="font1"> a burden imposed for&nbsp;the purpose of defence of the realm. The rudiments of the&nbsp;conceptions of tenure and of the crown as lord paramount were&nbsp;found in the old English system, and lænland was an anticipation&nbsp;of the limited interests which afterwards became of such importance.@@<sup>1</sup> The connexion of political privileges with the ownership</span></p><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> The name has not remained as in Germany and Denmark.
