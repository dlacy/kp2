<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a further political allusion (No. 9). It is very skilfully arranged to fit in the awkward space round the window, and is remarkable&nbsp;for an attempt, not much suited for fresco-painting, to combine&nbsp;and contrast the three different qualities of light coming from the&nbsp;moon, the glory round the angel, and the torches of the sentinels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">For room C Raphael designed and partly painted the Incendio del Borgo (No. 11), a fire in the Borgo or Leonine City, which was&nbsp;miraculously stopped by Leo IV. appearing and making the sign&nbsp;of the cross at a window in the Vatican. In the background is&nbsp;shown the façade of the old basilica of St Peter, not yet destroyed&nbsp;when this fresco was painted. One group on the left, in the foreground, is remarkable for its vigour and powerful drawing ; the&nbsp;motive is taken from the burning of Troy ; a fine nude figure of&nbsp;Æneas issues from the burning houses bearing on his back the old&nbsp;Anchises and leading the boy Ascanius by the hand. Some of the&nbsp;female figures are designed with much grace and dramatic power.&nbsp;Many studies for this picture exist. This is the last of the stanze&nbsp;frescos on which Raphael himself worked. Others designed by&nbsp;him and painted by Giulio Romano, Gianfrancesco Penni, and other&nbsp;pupils were the Battle of Ostia (No. 12), a very nobly composed&nbsp;picture, and the Oath of Leo III. before Charlemagne (No. 14).&nbsp;The other great picture in this room (No. 13), the Coronation of&nbsp;Charlemagne (a portrait of Francis I. of France), is so very inferior&nbsp;in composition that it is difficult to believe that Raphael even made&nbsp;a sketch for it. The enormous fresco of the Defeat of Maxentius&nbsp;by Constantine (room D, No. 17) was painted by Giulio Romano,&nbsp;soon after Raphael’s death, from a sketch by the latter ; it is even&nbsp;more harsh and disagreeable in colour than most of Giulio Romano’s&nbsp;early frescos.@@<sup>1</sup> Among the other very inferior frescos in this great&nbsp;hall are two female figures (Nos. 15 and 16) representing Comitas&nbsp;and Justitia, painted on the wall in oil colours, very harmonious&nbsp;and rich in tone ; they are usually, though wrongly, atti’ibuted to&nbsp;Raphael himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Technical Methods employed in Raphael's Frescos</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">.—Having made many studies, both nude and draped, for single figures and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">groups, the painter made a small drawing of the whole composition, which was enlarged by his pupils with the help of numbered squares, drawn all over it, to the full size required,@@<sup>2</sup> on paper or&nbsp;canvas. Holes were then pricked along the outlines of the cartoon,&nbsp;and the design pounced through on to an undercoat of dry stucco&nbsp;on the wall, with Bounded charcoal and a stiff brush. Over this,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">early in the morning, a patch of wet stucco was laid, about enough to serve for the day’s painting ; this of course obliterated the outline on the wall, and the part covered by the patch was again&nbsp;sketched in by freehand, with a point on the wet stucco, so as to&nbsp;be a guide for the outline traced with the brush and the subsequent&nbsp;painting. A line impressed on the wet stucco was easily smoothed&nbsp;out, but a touch of the brush full of pigment sank deeply into the&nbsp;moist stucco, and could not easily be effaced. It will thus be seen&nbsp;that in fresco painting the only use of pouncing the whole design&nbsp;on to the wall was to keep the general positions of the figures right,&nbsp;and was no guide as to the drawing of each separate part. Fig. 5&nbsp;shows the portrait-heads of himself and Perugino, at the extreme&nbsp;left of the School of Athens; on this are visible many of the&nbsp;impressed sketch-lines, and also part of the “ fresco edge ” of the&nbsp;patch on which this part is painted. The heads in this figure are&nbsp;less than one day’s work. It will be seen that there is no attempt&nbsp;at any accuracy of drawing in the impressed lines. Raphael, especially in his later frescos, worked with wonderful rapidity: three&nbsp;life-sized busts, or half a full-length figure, more than life-size,&nbsp;was a not unusual day’s work. In some of the frescos the edges&nbsp;of each day’s patch of stucco can easily be traced, especially in the&nbsp;Incendio del Borgo, which has a strong side light. In the Disputa&nbsp;much use was made of tempera in the final touches, but less was&nbsp;used in the subsequent frescos, owing to his increasing mastery of&nbsp;the difficulties of the process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The paintings in the stanze were only a small part of Raphael’s work between 1509 and 1513. To this period&nbsp;belong the Madonna of Foligno (Vatican), painted in 1511&nbsp;for Sigismondo Conti; it is one of his most beautiful&nbsp;compositions, full of the utmost grace and sweetness of&nbsp;expression, and appears to be wholly the work of his hand.&nbsp;It has suffered much from repainting. Of about the same&nbsp;date are the gem-like Garvagh Madonna (National Gallery,&nbsp;bought for £9000; once in the possession of the Aldo-brandini family), the Diademed Virgin of the Louvre, and&nbsp;the Madonna del Pesce at Madrid. The last is a very&nbsp;noble picture, but the design is more pleasing than the&nbsp;colour, which, like other paintings of Raphael’s at Madrid,&nbsp;suggests the inferior touch of a pupil; it was executed in&nbsp;1513 for S. Domenico in Naples. In addition to other&nbsp;easel pictures a number of his finest portraits belong to&nbsp;this period—that of Julius II. (Uffizi),@@<sup>3</sup> of which a good&nbsp;replica or contemporary copy exists in the National Gallery,&nbsp;the so-called Fornarina in the Palazzo Barberini, the Bal-dassare Castiglione of the Louvre, and the unfinished portrait of Federigo Gonzaga of Mantua.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">When Giovanni de’ Medici, at the age of thirty-eight, became pope as Leo X., a period of the most glowing&nbsp;splendour and reckless magnificence succeeded the sterner&nbsp;rule of Julius II. Agostino Chigi, the Sienese financier,&nbsp;was the chief of those whose lavish expenditure contributed&nbsp;to enrich Rome with countless works of art. For him&nbsp;Raphael painted, in 1513-14, the very beautiful fresco&nbsp;of the Triumph of Galatea in his new palace by the Tiber&nbsp;bank, the Villa Farnesina, and also made a large series of&nbsp;magnificent designs from Apuleius’s romance of Cupid&nbsp;and Psyche, which were carried out by a number of his&nbsp;pupils.@@<sup>4</sup> These cover the vault and lunettes of a large&nbsp;loggia (now closed in for protection); in colouring they&nbsp;are mostly harsh and gaudy,@@<sup>5</sup> as is usually the case with&nbsp;the works of his pupils, a great contrast to the fresco of&nbsp;the Galatea, the greater part of which is certainly the&nbsp;master’s own work.@@<sup>6</sup> For the same patron he painted</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

Though he&nbsp;was never a good colourist, the great frescos by Giulio Romano in the&nbsp;Palazzo del Te, Mantua, show some improvement as compared with his&nbsp;Roman work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three stages were usually distinguished as </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">study, sketch,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">cartoon.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
