The particles are therefore in the state represented by B in figure 1, acted on by repulsive forces if brought nearer, and by attractive forces if drawn further asunder. Ice expands, like all other bodies, by heat. It absorbs a vast quantity of fire, which, by combining its attractions and repulsions with those of the particles of ice, changes completely the law of action, and the ice becomes water. In this new state the particles are again in limits between attractive and repulsive forces ; for water has been shown, by the experiments of Canton and Zimmerman, to be elastic or compressible. It again expands by heat. It again absorbs a prodigious quantity of heat, and becomes elastic vapour ; its particles repelling each other at all distances yet observed. The distance between the particles of one plate of glass and those of another which lies on it, and is carried by it, is a distance of repulsion ; for the force which supports the upper piece is acting in opposition to its weight. This distance is less than that at which it would <hi rend="italic">suspend</hi> it below it with a silk fibre interposed ; for no prismatic colours appear between them when the silk fibre is interposed. But the distance at which glass attracts water is much less than this, for no colours appear when glass is wetted with water. This distance is less, and not greater, than the other ; for when the glasses have water interposed between them instead of air, it is found, that when any particular colour appears, the thickness of the plate of water is to that of the plate of air which would produce the same colour, nearly as three to four. Now, if a piece of glass be wetted, and exhibit no colour, and another piece of glass be simply laid on it, no colour will appear ; but if they are strongly pressed, the colours appear in the same manner as if the glasses had air between. Also, when glass is simply wetted, and the film of water is allowed to evaporate, when it is thus reduced to a proper thinness the colours show themselves in great beauty.</p><p>These are a few of many thousand facts, by which it is unquestionably proved that the particles of tangible matter are connected by forces acting at a distance, varying with the distance, and alternately attractive and repulsive. If we represent these forces, as we have already done in fig. 1, by the ordinates Cc, D<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, Ee, F<hi rend="italic">f, &amp;c. of</hi> a curve, it is evident that this curve must cross the axis at all those distances where the forces change from attractive to repulsive, and the curve must have branches alternately above and below the axis.</p><p>All these alternations of attraction and repulsion take place at small and insensible distances. At all sensible distances the particles are influenced by the attraction of gravitation ; and therefore this part of the curve must be a</p><p>hyperbola whose equation is y=p∙ What is the form of the curve corresponding to the smallest distance of the particles? that is, what is the mutual action between the particles just before their coming into absolute contact? Analogy should lead us to suppose it to be repulsion ; for solidity is the last and simplest form of bodies with which we are acquainted. Fluids are more compounded, containing fire as an essential ingredient. We should conclude that this ultimate repulsion is insuperable, for the hardest bodies are the most elastic. We are fully entitled to say that this repelling force exceeds all that we have ever yet applied to overcome it ; nay, there are good reasons for saying that this ultimate repulsion, by which the particles are kept from mathematical contact, is really insuperable in its own nature, and that it is impossible to produce mathematical contact.</p><p><hi style="color:red; font-size: 14pt; font-weight:bold;" rend="ERROR">�</hi><note place="margin" type="conversion" resp="#teitodocx"><hi rend="docxError">unable to handle picture here, no embed or link</hi></note>mathematical contact, and impels it (according to the common acceptation of the word). Both move with the velocity 1. This is granted by all to be the final result of the collision. Now the instant of time in which this communication happens is no part either of the duration of the solitary motion of A, nor of the joint motion of A and B : it is the separation or boundary between them. It is at once the end of the first and the beginning of the second, belonging equally to both. A was moving with the volocity 2. The distinguishing circumstance, therefore, of its mechanical state is, that it has a determination (however incomprehensible) by which it would move for ever with the velocity 2, if nothing changed it. This it has during the whole of its solitary motion, and therefore in the last instant of this motion. In like manner, during the whole of the joint motion, and therefore in the first instant of this motion, the atom A has a determination by which it would move for ever with the velocity 1. In one and the same instant, therefore, the atom A has two incompatible determinations. Whatever notion we can form of this state, which we call velocity, as a distinction of condition, the same impossibility of conception, or the same absurdity, occurs. Nor can it be avoided in any other way than by saying, that this change of A’s motion is brought about by insensible gradations ; that is, that A and B influence each other precisely as they would do if a slender spring were interposed. The reader is desired to look at what we have said in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Physics.</hi>The two magnets there spoken of are good representatives of two atoms endowed with mutual powers of repulsion ; and the communication of motion is accomplished in both cases in precisely the same manner.If, therefore, we shall ever be so fortunate as to discover the law of variation of that force which connects one <hi rend="italic">atom </hi>of matter with another atom, and which is therefore characteristic of matter, and the ultimate source of all its sensible qualities, the curve whose ordinates represent the kind and the intensity of this atomical force will be something like that sketched in fig. 2. The first branch <hi rend="italic">a n</hi> B will haveAK (perpendicular to the axis AH) for its assymptote. and the last branch <hi rend="italic">lino</hi> will be to all sense a hyperbola, having AO for its assymptote; and the ordinates <hi rend="italic">l</hi>L, <hi rend="italic">m</hi>M, &amp;c. will be proportional to -ry—,	<hi rend="strikethrough">L ;</hi>, &amp;c. expressing the universalALz ΑΛΙ*gravitation of matter. It will have many branches B<hi rend="italic">b</hi>C, D<hi rend="italic">d</hi>E, F<hi rend="italic">f</hi>G, &amp;c. expressing attractions, and alternate repulsive branches C<hi rend="italic">c</hi>D, E<hi rend="italic">e</hi>F, G<hi rend="italic">g</hi>H, &amp;c. All these will be contained within a distance AH, which does not exceed a very minute fraction of an inch.The simplest particle which can be a constituent of a body having length, breadth, and thickness, must consist of four such atoms, all of which combine their influence on each atom of another such particle. It is evident that the curve which expresses the force that connects two such particles must be totally different from this original curve, this hylarchic principle. Supposing the last known, our mathematical knowledge is quite able to discover the first ; but when we proceed to conquise a body of particles, each ofWe shall just mention one of these, which we consider as unanswerable. Suppose two atoms, or ultimate particles of matter, A and B. Let A be at rest, and B move up to it with the velocity 2 : and let us suppose that it comes into</p></body></text></TEI>
