<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">pieces of these men and their compeers Brunelleschi and Donatello, how even in the 15th century the minds of&nbsp;artists were fascinated by what survived of classic grace&nbsp;and science. Gradually, as the race became penetrated&nbsp;with antique thought, the earlier Christian motives of the&nbsp;arts yielded to pagan subjects. Gothic architecture, which&nbsp;had always flourished feebly on Italian soil, was supplanted&nbsp;by a hybrid Roman style. The study of Vitruvius gave&nbsp;strong support to that pseudo-classic manner which, when&nbsp;it had reached its final point in Palladio’s work, overspread&nbsp;the whole of Europe and dominated taste during two&nbsp;centuries. But the perfect plastic art of Italy, the pure&nbsp;art of the Cinque Cento, the painting of Raphael, Da&nbsp;Vinci, Titian, and Correggio, the sculpture of Donatello,&nbsp;Michelangelo, and Sansovino, the architecture of Bra-man te, Omodco, and the Venetian Lombardi, however much&nbsp;imbued with the spirit of the classical revival, takes rank&nbsp;beside the poetry of Ariosto as a free intelligent product&nbsp;of the Renaissance. That is to say, it is not so much an&nbsp;outcome of studies in antiquity as an exhibition of&nbsp;emancipated modern genius fired and illuminated by the&nbsp;masterpieces of the past. It indicates a separation from&nbsp;the Middle Ages, inasmuch as it is permanently natural.&nbsp;Its religion is joyous, sensuous, dramatic, terrible, but in&nbsp;each and all of its many-sided manifestations strictly&nbsp;human. Its touch on classical mythology is original,&nbsp;rarely imitative or pedantic. The art of the Renaissance&nbsp;was an apocalypse of the beauty of the world and man in&nbsp;unaffected spontaneity, without side thoughts for piety or&nbsp;erudition, inspired by pure delight in loveliness and&nbsp;harmony for their own sakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">In the fields of science and philosophy humanism wrought ' similar important changes. Petrarch began by waging relentless war against the logicians and materialists of his own&nbsp;day. &quot;With the advance made in Greek studies scholastic&nbsp;methods of thinking fell into contemptuous oblivion. The&nbsp;newly aroused curiosity for nature encouraged men like&nbsp;Alberti, Da Vinci, Toscanelli, and Da Porta to make practical experiments, penetrate the working of physical forces,&nbsp;and invent scientific instruments. Anatomy began to be&nbsp;studied, and the time w<sup>r</sup>as not far distant when Titian&nbsp;should lend his pencil to the epoch-making treatise of&nbsp;Vesalius. The Middle Ages had been satisfied with absurd&nbsp;and visionary notions about the world around them, while&nbsp;the body of man was regarded with too much suspicion&nbsp;to be studied. Now the right method of interrogating&nbsp;nature with patience and loving admiration was instituted.&nbsp;At the same time the texts of ancient authors supplied&nbsp;hints which led to discoveries so far-reaching in their&nbsp;results as those of Copernicus, Columbus, and Galileo. In&nbsp;philosophy, properly so-called, the humanistic scorn for&nbsp;mediaeval dulness and obscurity swept away theological&nbsp;metaphysics as valueless. But at first little beyond empty&nbsp;rhetoric and clumsy compilation was substituted. The&nbsp;ethical treatises of the scholars are deficient in substance,&nbsp;while Ficino’s attempt to revive Platonism betrays an&nbsp;uncritical conception of his master’s drift. It was something, however, to have shaken off the shackles of ecclesiastical authority ; and, even if a new authority, that of the&nbsp;ancients, was accepted in its stead, still progress was being&nbsp;made toward sounder methods of analysis. This is noticeable in Pomponazzo’s system of materialism, based on the&nbsp;interpretation of Aristotle, but revealing a virile spirit of&nbsp;disinterested and unprejudiced research. The thinkers of&nbsp;southern Italy, Telesio, Bruno, and Campanella, at last&nbsp;opened the two chief lines on which modern speculation&nbsp;has since moved. Telesio and Campanella may be termed&nbsp;the predecessors of Bacon. Bruno was the precursor of the&nbsp;idealistic schools. All three alike strove to disengage their&nbsp;minds from classical as well as ecclesiastical authority,</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">proving that the emancipation of the will had been accomplished. It must be added that their writings, like every other product of the Renaissance, except its purest poetry&nbsp;and art, exhibit a hybrid between mediaeval arid modern tendencies. Childish ineptitudes are mingled with intuitions&nbsp;of maturcst wisdom, and seeds of future thought germinate&nbsp;in the decaying refuse of past systems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Humanism in its earliest stages was uncritical. It absorbed the relics of antiquity with omnivorous appetite,&nbsp;and with very imperfect sense of the distinction between&nbsp;worse and better work. Yet it led in process of time to&nbsp;criticism. The critique of literature began in the lecture&nbsp;room of Politian, in the printing-house of Aldus, and in the&nbsp;school of Vittorino. The critique of Roman law started,&nbsp;under Politian’s auspices, upon a more liberal course than&nbsp;that which had been followed by the powerful but narrow-sighted glossators of Bologna. Finally, in the court of&nbsp;Naples arose that most formidable of all critical engines,&nbsp;the critique of established ecclesiastical traditions and&nbsp;spurious historical documents. Valla by one vigorous&nbsp;effort destroyed the False Decretals and exposed the Donation of Constantine to ridicule, paving the way for the&nbsp;polemic carried on against the dubious pretensions of the&nbsp;papal throne by scholars of the Reformation. A similar&nbsp;criticism, conducted less on lines of erudition than of&nbsp;persiflage and irony, ransacked the moral abuses of the&nbsp;church and played around the very foundations of Christianity. This was tolerated with approval by men who&nbsp;repeated Leo X.’s witty epigram: “What profit has&nbsp;not that fable of Christ brought us ! ” The same critical&nbsp;and philosophic spirit working on the materials of history&nbsp;produced a new science, the honours of which belong to&nbsp;Machiavelli. He showed, on the one side, how the history&nbsp;of a people can be written with a recognition of fixed principles, and at the same time with an artistic feeling for&nbsp;personal and dramatic episodes. On the other side, he&nbsp;addressed himself to the analysis of man considered as a&nbsp;political being, to the anatomy of constitutions and the&nbsp;classification of governments, to the study of motives underlying public action, the secrets of success and the causes of&nbsp;failure in the conduct of affairs. The unscrupulous rigour&nbsp;with which he applied his scientific method, and the&nbsp;sinister deductions he thought himself justified in drawing&nbsp;from the results it yielded, excited terror and repulsion.&nbsp;Nevertheless, a department had been added to the intellectual empire of mankind, in which fellow-workers, like&nbsp;Guicciardini at Florence, and subsequently Sarpi at Venice,&nbsp;were not slow to follow the path traced by Machiavelli.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The object of the foregoing paragraphs has been to show in what way the positive, inquisitive, secular, exploratory spirit of the Renaissance, when toned and controlled&nbsp;by humanism, ¡penetrated the regions of literature, art,&nbsp;philosophy, and science. It becomes at this point of much&nbsp;moment to consider how social manners in Italy were&nbsp;modified by the same causes, since the type developed&nbsp;there was in large measure communicated together with&nbsp;the new culture to the rest of Europe. The first subject&nbsp;to be noticed under this heading is education. What has&nbsp;come to be called a classical education was the immediate&nbsp;product of the Italian Renaissance. The universities of&nbsp;Bologna, Padua, and Salerno had been famous through the&nbsp;Middle Ages for the study of law, physics, and medicine;&nbsp;and during the 15th and 16th centuries the two first still&nbsp;enjoyed celebrity in those faculties. But at this period no&nbsp;lecture-rooms were so crowded as those in which professors&nbsp;of antique literature and language read passages from the&nbsp;poets and orators, taught Greek, and commented upon the&nbsp;systems of philosophers. The mediaeval curriculum offered&nbsp;no defined place for the new learning of the Revival, which&nbsp;I had indeed no recognized name. Chairs had therefore to</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
