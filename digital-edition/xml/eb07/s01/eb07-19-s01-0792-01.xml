<hi rend="italic">(Scrutinium),</hi> in the primitive church, was an examination or probation practised in the last week of Lent, upon the catechumens, who were to receive baptism on Easter-day. The scrutiny was performed with a great many ceremonies. Exorcisms and prayers were made over the heads of the catechumens ; and upon Palm Sunday the Lordâ€™s Prayer and Creed were given them, which they were afterwards made to rehearse. This custom was more in use in the Church of Rome than anywhere else, though it appears, by some missals, to have been likewise used, at a much later period, in the Gallican church. It is supposed to have ceased about the year 860.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scrutiny</hi> is also used, in the <hi rend="italic">canon Law,</hi> for a ticket or a little paper billet, in which, at elections, the electors write their votes privately, so that it may not be known for whom they vote. Among us the term <hi rend="italic">scrutiny</hi> is chiefly used for a strict perusal and examination of the several votes hastily taken at an election, in order to find out any irregularities committed therein by unqualified voters.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
