<p><span class="font0">RECTOR, a term applied to several persons whose offices are very different. The rector of a parish is a clergyman who has the charge and cure of a parish, and possesses&nbsp;all the tithes, &amp;c. The same name is also given to the&nbsp;chief elective officer in several foreign universities, particularly in that of Paris, and also in those of Scotland ; and it&nbsp;is likewise applied to the head master of large schools in&nbsp;Scotland, as in the High School of Edinburgh. Rector is&nbsp;further used in several convents to indicate the superior&nbsp;officer who governs the house ; and the Jesuits give this&nbsp;name to the superiors of such of their houses as are either&nbsp;seminaries or colleges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RECTORY is a parish-church, parsonage, or spiritual living, with all its rights, tithes, and glebes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rectory, however, is sometimes used for the rector’s mansion or parsonage-house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RECUPERATORES, amongst the Romans, were commissioners appointed to take cognizance of private matters in dispute, between the subjects of the state and foreigners,&nbsp;and to take care that the former had justice done them.&nbsp;It came at last to be used for commissioners, to whom the&nbsp;praetor referred the determination of any affair between one&nbsp;subject and another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RECUSANTS, such persons as acknowledge the pope to be the supreme head of the church, and refuse to acknowledge the king’s supremacy. They are hence called Popish&nbsp;Recusants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RED, one of the colours called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">simple</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">primary,</span><span class="font0"> being one of the shades into which the light naturally divides itself when refracted through a prism.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RED RIVER is one of the principal confluents of the Mississippi, in North America. Its source is situated at the&nbsp;base of a range </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">the Rocky Mountains, called the Caous&nbsp;Mountains, near Santa Fe, in Mexico. A great number&nbsp;of streams descend this chain, and, flowing separately for&nbsp;some three or four hundred miles, at length unite and form&nbsp;the Red River. The country through which its upper&nbsp;branches flow is but little known. After the river enters&nbsp;Louisiana, its south bank forms for a great distance the&nbsp;boundary between the United States and Texas. Much of&nbsp;its course lies through noble prairies of a rich red soil covered with grass intermingled with vines, which bear, it is&nbsp;said, excellent grapes. About a hundred miles above Natchitoches the alluvion enlarges to a breadth of twenty or&nbsp;thirty miles, forming a sort of swampy bed through which&nbsp;the river flows in a number of channels. Great quantities&nbsp;of timber, brought down from the upper parts of the river,&nbsp;have for ages been accumulating in these channels, and to&nbsp;such an extent, that in soιpe parts the stream may be crossed on horseback. Hence the name of Raft, which this&nbsp;swampy expansion bears throughout its whole extent. The&nbsp;river finds its way sometimes below these accumulations of&nbsp;timber, sometimes between them. Nearly seventy miles of&nbsp;the river are thus obstructed ; and it is of incalculable injury to its navigation, for here small boats only can pass.&nbsp;For nearly a thousand miles above the Raft the soil is extremely rich, and the climate very salubrious ; but, until</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">this obstacle be removed, it will form an almost insurmount I able barrier to its proper settlement. Below the Raft the&nbsp;river separates into a number of channels, and expands at&nbsp;intervals into a multitude of sheets of water. Its breadth&nbsp;enlarges as it approaches the Mississippi ; but immediately&nbsp;below the Raft the channel becomes narrower than above&nbsp;it. From both sides it receives a vast number of tributaries.&nbsp;The whole length of this noble stream is estimated at 2500&nbsp;miles, following its meanderings ; and it enters the Mississippi in about 31° 15' north latitude. It was supposcd at&nbsp;one time to discharge itself into the Gulf of Mexico without&nbsp;joining the Mississippi. Much of the soil through which&nbsp;the Red River passes in its upper course is of a reddish colour, which is imparted to the waters, and hence the name of&nbsp;the stream. So impregnated is it with this ochreous earth,&nbsp;that at low water at Natchitoches it cannot be used for culinary purposes. The valley of Red River is three or four&nbsp;miles in breadth as far as the Kiamesia, which, following its&nbsp;windings, is about a thousand miles from its mouth. But&nbsp;it widens to from six to eighteen miles as it approaches the&nbsp;Mississippi, and is of an average breadth of twelve miles for&nbsp;a great distance above the confluence </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">the rivers. This&nbsp;alluvial tract is considered as equal to any in all the vast&nbsp;valley of the Mississippi. The staple production is cotton,&nbsp;of a quality superior to any raised in the United States&nbsp;except Sea Island. Its indigo and tobacco are the best&nbsp;raised in Louisiana ; and sugar has been introduced, and&nbsp;found to thrive well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(r. r. r.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Red River is also the name of a number of other American streams. The most important is that which flows into Lake Winnipeg, in the northern part of North America.&nbsp;It is formed of two branches, the principal of which rises in&nbsp;Red Lake, and flows west by north for a hundred and fifty&nbsp;miles, when it is joined by the other branch. It then&nbsp;changes its direction to east of north, and flows for a hundred and eighty miles below its junction, when it falls into&nbsp;Lake Winnipeg.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(R. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">r. r.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RED SEA. This great inlet of the Indian Ocean, which divides Arabia from the opposite coast of Africa, extends&nbsp;in a north-west direction about 1400 miles from the Straits&nbsp;of Babelmandel, where it is not above thirty miles across to&nbsp;Suez, and only sixty miles distant from the Mediterranean,&nbsp;so that the maritime communication by this route between&nbsp;India and Europe is only divided by this narrow isthmus,&nbsp;which also forms the connecting link between the continents of Asia and Africa. This sea lies between the&nbsp;twelfth and thirtieth degrees of north latitude, and is nowhere broader than 200 miles, and scarcely ever of that&nbsp;width. The navigation of *he Red Sea is difficult and&nbsp;dangerous, owing to the reefs and coral rocks both above&nbsp;and under the water ; and also, for nine months of the year,&nbsp;in consequence of the violent winds which blow regularly&nbsp;from the north, and impede the passage from the Straits to&nbsp;Suez. There are few harbours to which vessels in distress&nbsp;can repair for shelter. On the eastern coast there is not a&nbsp;single harbour from Suez to Yambo, the port of Medina,&nbsp;nor thence to Jidda. Compodah is the next harbour, about&nbsp;150 miles south of Jidda. But, in entering Yemen, there&nbsp;are the harbours of Mocha, Loheia, and Hodeida. The navigation to Suez, at the head of the gulf, is extremely difficult through the upper part of the Red Sea, the channel&nbsp;through which vessels have to pass being narrow, with rocks&nbsp;sunk beneath the surface. The only other ports on the western shore are Cosseir, the port and road of which are formed&nbsp;by reefs, which defend it from the north-east winds, and by&nbsp;a headland, which secures it against those blowing from the&nbsp;south-south-east, and which has only a depth of water of two&nbsp;fathoms and a half. Here the goods destined for Egypt are&nbsp;landed, conveyed by land to Keneh on the Nile, thence&nbsp;down the river to Alexandria. Suakim, about 500 miles&nbsp;south-east of Cosseir, is extremely difficult of entrance, not</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
