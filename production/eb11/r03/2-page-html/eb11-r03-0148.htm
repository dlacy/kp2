<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mémoires militaires, historiques et politiques, de Rochambeau </span><span class="font1">were published by Luce de Lancival in 1809. Of the first volume&nbsp;a part, translated into English by M. W. E.

<p><span class="font1">ROCHDALE, a municipal, county and parliamentary borough of Lancashire, England, on the river Roch, 10-J m. N.N.E. from&nbsp;Manchester and 196 m. N.W. by N. from London, on the&nbsp;Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire railway. Pop. (1891)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76,161;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(1901) 83,114. By means of the Rochdale canal and connexions it has water communications in every direction. The site rises sharply from the Roch, near its confluence with the&nbsp;Spodden, and from the high-lying public park of Rochdale&nbsp;fine views of the picturesque neighbourhood are obtained.&nbsp;Several interesting old houses remain in the vicinity of the&nbsp;town. The parish church of St Chad is built on the site of a&nbsp;church erected in the 12th century, but itself retains no portion&nbsp;earlier than the Perpendicular period. In the churchyard is&nbsp;buried John Collier (1708-1786), a local author, artist and&nbsp;caricaturist, who was among the first to recognize and utilize&nbsp;in writing the humour of the Lancashire dialect, and attained&nbsp;considerable fame under the pseudonym of Tim Bobbin. The&nbsp;town hall is an extensive and elaborate structure in the Decorated&nbsp;style, with a tower. Of educational charities the principal is&nbsp;the Archbishop Parker free grammar school, founded in 1565.&nbsp;There are also technical and art schools; and a large Roman&nbsp;Catholic orphanage. Among other public institutions are&nbsp;the public library, the infirmary, the literary and scientific&nbsp;society and the art society. Rochdale was the birthplace of&nbsp;the co-operative movement. The Equitable Pioneers Society&nbsp;(1844) numbers over 11,000 members, with a capital of over&nbsp;£350,000. A handsome co-operative store, belonging to the&nbsp;Rochdale Provident Co-operative Society, was opened in 1900.&nbsp;A statue of John Bright (1891) recalls the connexion of the&nbsp;statesman and his family with Rochdale. The staple manufactures are those of woollens and cottons. There are, besides,&nbsp;foundries, iron-works and machine-factories. Coal and stone&nbsp;are obtained extensively in the neighbourhood. Frequent&nbsp;cattle and horse fairs are held. Rochdale was incorporated&nbsp;in 1856, and includes several townships. The corporation&nbsp;consists of a mayor, 10 aldermen and 30 councillors. The&nbsp;county borough was created in 1888. The parliamentary&nbsp;borough, which has returned one member since 1832, falls&nbsp;between the Middleton and Heywood divisions of the county.&nbsp;Area of municipal borough, 6446 acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rochdale (Recedham, Rachedam, Rachedal) takes its name from the river on which it stands. A Roman road&nbsp;passed the site, and a Saxon castle stood in Castleton, one&nbsp;of the component parts of the town. In Edward the Confessor’s reign most of the land was held by Gamel the Thane,&nbsp;but after the Conquest the manor probably came into the&nbsp;hands of Roger de Poictou, from whom it passed to the Lacys&nbsp;and like their other lands became merged in. the duchy of Lancaster. From 1462 to 1625 the crown seems to have leased&nbsp;it to the Byron family. In 1625 Charles I. conveyed the&nbsp;manor in trust for the earl of Holdernesse, and in 1638 it was&nbsp;sold to Sir John Byron, afterwards Baron Byron of Rochdale,&nbsp;whose descendants held it till 1823 when it was sold to the&nbsp;Deardens. Manor courts are still held periodically. JIenry III.&nbsp;in 1240-41 granted by charter to Edmund de Lacy the right to&nbsp;hold a weekly market on Wednesday and an annual fair on&nbsp;the feast of ijS Simon and Jude (28th October). Early in&nbsp;George IIIJs reign the market day was changed to Monday.&nbsp;Two of the early industries, cutlery and hat-making, date&nbsp;from about the middle of the 16th century. The woollen&nbsp;industry is generally, but erroneously, said to have been introduced by Flemish immigrants in Edward IIIJs reign; but,&nbsp;with the cognate trades of dyeing and fulling, its importance&nbsp;only dates from the early part of the 17th century. It was&nbsp;not till 1795 that a cotton mill was built here, and in the latter&nbsp;half of the 18th century the town was famed for its woollen, not&nbsp;its cotton manufactures.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROCHE, SIR BOYLE, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bart.</span><span class="font1"> (1743-1807), Irish soldier and politician, famous for his “ bulls,” came of a branch of&nbsp;the family of the Viscounts Fermoy. He served in the&nbsp;American War, and sat in the Irish parliament from 1777&nbsp;onwards, being created a baronet in 1782 for his loyalty to&nbsp;the government. He supported the Union, and one of his&nbsp;recorded “ bulls ”—many, however, being only fastened on&nbsp;him—was his declaration that he would have “ the two sisters ”&nbsp;(England and Ireland) “ embrace like one brother.” Sir&nbsp;Boyle Roche was a characteristically witty and genial Irishman, and was master of the ceremonies at Dublin Castle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROCHEFORT, HENRI, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Marqxhs de Rochefort-Luqay </span><span class="font1">(1830-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), French politician, was bom in Paris on the 30th</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of January 1830. His father was a Legitimist noble who as “ Edmond Rochefort ” was well known as a writer of vaudevilles; his mother’s views were republican. After experience&nbsp;as a medical student, a clerk at the Hôtel de VUle, a playwright and a journalist, he joined the staff of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Figaro&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">in 1863; but a series of his articles, afterwards published as&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les Français de la Décadence</span><span class="font1"> (3 vols., 1866-68), brought the&nbsp;paper into collision with the authorities and caused the termination of his engagement. In collaboration with different&nbsp;dramatists he had meanwhile written a long series of successful&nbsp;vaudevilles, which began with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Monsieur bien mis</span><span class="font1"> at the&nbsp;Folies Dramatiques in 1856. On leaving the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Figaro</span><span class="font1"> Rochefort&nbsp;determined to start a paper of his own, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">La Lanterne.</span><span class="font1"> The&nbsp;paper was seized on its eleventh appearance, and in August&nbsp;1868 Rochefort was fined 10,000 francs, with a year’s imprisonment. He then published his paper in Brussels, whence it was&nbsp;smuggled into France. Printed in French, Enghsh, Spanish,&nbsp;Italian and German, it went the round of Europe. After a&nbsp;second prosecution he fled to Belgium. A series of duels, of&nbsp;which the most famous was one fought with Paul de Cassagnac&nbsp;a propos of an article on Joan of Arc, kept Rochefort in the&nbsp;public eye. In 1869, after two unsuccessful candidatures, he&nbsp;was returned to the Chamber of Deputies by the first circonscription of Paris. He w<sup>r</sup>as arrested on the frontier, only to&nbsp;be almost immediately released, and forthwith took his seat.&nbsp;He renewed his onslaught on the empire, starting a new paper,&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Marseillaise,</span><span class="font1"> as the organ of political meetings arranged&nbsp;by himself at La Villette. The staff was appointed on the&nbsp;votes of the members, and included Victor Noir and Pascal&nbsp;Grousset. The violent articles in this paper led to the duel&nbsp;which resulted in Victor Noir’s death at the hands of Prince&nbsp;Pierre Bonaparte. The paper was seized, and Rochefort and&nbsp;Grousset were sent to prison for six months. The revolution&nbsp;of September was the signal for his release. He became a&nbsp;member of the government of National Defence, but this&nbsp;short association with the forces of law and order was soon&nbsp;broken on account of his openly expressed sympathy with&nbsp;the Communards. On the nth of May 1871 he fled in disguise from Paris. A week earlier he had resigned with a&nbsp;handful of other deputies from the National Assembly ratjier&nbsp;than countenance the dismemberment of France. Arrested&nbsp;at Meaux by the Versailles government, he was detained for&nbsp;some time in prison with a nervous illness before he was condemned under military law to imprisonment for life. In&nbsp;spite of Victor Hugo’s efforts on his behalf he was transported&nbsp;to New Caledonia. In 1874 he escaped on board an American&nbsp;vessel to San Francisco. He lived in London and Geneva&nbsp;until the general amnesty permitted his return to France in&nbsp;1880. In Geneva he resumed the publication of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">La Lanterne,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and in the Parisian papers articles constantly appeared&nbsp;from his pen. When at length in 1880 the general amnesty</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
