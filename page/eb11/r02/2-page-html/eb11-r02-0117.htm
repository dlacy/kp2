<p><span class="font0">capitular and tubercular processes, which, articulating with the bodies and with dorsolateral processes of the neural&nbsp;arches of their vertebrae,&nbsp;enclose typical transverse&nbsp;canals. In the posterior&nbsp;thoracic region <sub>L</sub>tbe ribs&nbsp;are attached entirely to&nbsp;transverse processes of&nbsp;the neural arches, both&nbsp;capitular and tubercular&nbsp;portions having left the&nbsp;bodies or centra; the&nbsp;same arrangement prevails in the tail, but the&nbsp;ribs are very short and&nbsp;soon fuse with the processes. The two sacral&nbsp;ribs are very thick,&nbsp;articulating with the&nbsp;centra and the bases of&nbsp;their neural arch, and&nbsp;they even form part of&nbsp;the intervertebral Joint !&nbsp;In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font0"> the first&nbsp;three ribs are represented by bands of connective tissue only, with similar attachments as in crocodiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The other cervical ribs are osseous; their short capitula retain their partly intercentral attachment, while the tubercula are&nbsp;carried by low processes of the centra. In the thorax both&nbsp;capitulum and tuberculum merge into one facet, which is&nbsp;gradually shifting farther tailwards and upwards until the&nbsp;attachment reaches them, and then lies upon the neuro-central&nbsp;suture. The first caudal vertebrae also possess ribs, very short&nbsp;and soon fusing with the diapophyses of the neural arches. In the&nbsp;cervical region of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chelonia</span><span class="font0"> the ribs seem to be absent. In&nbsp;the thorax they retain their primitive intercentral position&nbsp;throughout life, assuming (except the first pair, which remains&nbsp;short and least modified) an absolutely intervertebral position.&nbsp;From the lumbar or presacral region backwards the capitula&nbsp;are gradually shifting upon short processes of the centra, until&nbsp;in the tail the vestigial ribs are carried by the diapophyses of&nbsp;the neural arches. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphargis</span><span class="font0"> (fig. 31) all the ribs are free; in&nbsp;the other Chelonians&nbsp;the ribs, generally in&nbsp;the recent species,&nbsp;flatten and become surrounded by the growing membrane bone&nbsp;of the dorsal plates,&nbsp;and the cartilage of the&nbsp;ribs (except the capitular and neck portion&nbsp;of the rib, which cannot&nbsp;be got at by the dermal&nbsp;bones) undergoes a process of calcification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ultimately this is resorbed and its place is taken by the dermal bone, which forms, so to speak, a cast of the rib. Several of the&nbsp;short presacral ribs, and of course the post sacrais, are not drawn&nbsp;into these enormous changes, although the carapace covers,&nbsp;and indirectly affects, them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Certain changes initiated in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font0"> are more marked in the ribs of the Lacertilia; cervical ribs are often long in the lower&nbsp;neck. In the trunk the capitular portions are often much&nbsp;reduced, and in these cases the ribs are suspended mainly by&nbsp;their tubercular portions, usually from the diapophyses of the&nbsp;neural arches near the anterior end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the snakes all the vertebrae, from the second cervical to the tail, carry ribs. These are very movable, articulating&nbsp;with a rather large, more or less vertically placed facet, which is&nbsp;borne by the parapophysis or transverse process; sometimes the&nbsp;rib retains traces of thc original division into a capitular and&nbsp;tubercular portion. The ribs of tbe snakes, although long,&nbsp;consist only of their dorsal portions. In snake-shaped lizards,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. Pseudopus,</span><span class="font0"> rather long ribs begin with the fourth vertebra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Uncinate processes are developed only in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font0"> and in the Crocodilia. They are not homologous structures, arising in tbe&nbsp;former from, the posterior margin of the middle of the dorsal&nbsp;portions of the ribs, overlapping the shaft of the next following&nbsp;rib; in the crocodiles they arise out of the middle portion of the&nbsp;ribs, remaining cartilaginous, whilst the middle portion coössifies&nbsp;with the dorsal. Only in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font0"> and Crocodiles the thoracic&nbsp;ribs consist of three successive pieces; in the Lacertilia they&nbsp;consist only of the dorsaI and the ventral or costostcmal. Thc&nbsp;latter remain cartilaginous, or they calcify, but they never&nbsp;ossify.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The sternum and further modifications of the ribs of lhe trunk. </span><span class="font0">—The sternum of most reptiles consists (1) of an anterior portion&nbsp;(presternum, Parker; prostemum, Fürbringer; mesostemum of&nbsp;Gegenbaur), which is generally broad, more or less rhomboid&nbsp;and carries the shoulder-girdle, and on its posterior sides severaI&nbsp;pairs of ribs; (2) of a posterior portion (mesostemum and xiphi-Sternum of Parker; Xiphisternum of Fürbringer; metastemum of&nbsp;Gegenbaur), which is narrow, sometimes metameric, carries&nbsp;several pairs of ribs, and generally divides into a right and left&nbsp;XiphoidaI half, each of which is continued into one or more ribs.&nbsp;These ribs tend to lose their connexion, and in these cases the&nbsp;sternum ends in two typical xiphoid processes. The distinction&nbsp;between pre- and metasternum is arbitrary. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font0"> the&nbsp;broad sternal plate carries only three pairs of ribs, the 8th to&nbsp;10th, and there is no Xiphisternum. The other ribs of the trunk&nbsp;are long and compound, but they remain free and do not approach&nbsp;the mid-line. From the posterior edge of the sternum to the&nbsp;pelvis extends the complicated </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">parasternum,</span><span class="font0"> embedded in the&nbsp;abdominal wall; it is composed of about two dozen sets of&nbsp;abdominal ribs, each set containing a right and a left and a&nbsp;median chevron-shaped piece. In the Crocodilia the presternum&nbsp;carries only two or one pair of ribs, always that of the 10th&nbsp;vertebra. The narrow&quot;, more or less metameric metastemum&nbsp;carries seven or eight ribs, the last one to three being xiphoidal.&nbsp;The post-thoracic ribs gradually decrease in length; about three&nbsp;presacral vertebrae have no ribs, and so are typically lumbar.&nbsp;The sacral ribs are generally the 25th and 26th in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Crocodilus&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Alligator*,</span><span class="font0"> sometimes the 24th and 25th in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gavialis.</span><span class="font0"> The&nbsp;parasternum consists of only seven or eight transverse sets, each&nbsp;composed of two right and tw<sup>r</sup>o left narrow splint-bones. AU&nbsp;these parasternal elements belong to the category of dermal&nbsp;bones, together with those of the plastron of tortoises, inherited&nbsp;from Stegocephalian conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Lacertilia present an almost endless variety. The presternum is rhomboid and broad; it carries from three to six&nbsp;pairs of ribs, mostly four or five; the first thoracic rib is that of&nbsp;the 9th vertebra, the only exceptions being tbe chameleons with&nbsp;only five cervical vertebrae, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Varanus,</span><span class="font0"> which has usually&nbsp;nine cervicals like the crocodiles. The last cervical rib in these&nbsp;long-necked lizards is very long and has all the appearance of&nbsp;having but recently severed its connexion with the sternum.&nbsp;The presternum of Lacertilia sometimes has a window, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">some species of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lacerla, Phrynosoma, Iguana,</span><span class="font0"> or a pair of&nbsp;windows, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. Agama, Liolepis, Goniocephalus.</span><span class="font0"> The xiphi-sternum carries a variable number of ribs; it is either scarcely&nbsp;distinguished from the anterior plate, or it is long, and in these&nbsp;cases either double, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. Iguana, Gerrhonotus, Varanus, Zonurus,&nbsp;Agama, Cyclodus, Lacerta',</span><span class="font0"> or single, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. Zonosanrus.</span><span class="font0"> Thc post-sternal ribs shorten gradually in the majority of the Lacertae,&nbsp;and there is sometimes a ribless lumbar vertebra, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font0"> in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Iguana,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">in many Lacertilia, however, the ventral cartilaginous halves&nbsp;of the ribs are connected with those of the other side, either&nbsp;by Ugaments, or they join together, forming complete hoops&nbsp;of thin cartilages. Such ribs occur in all Geckones and Chameleons, but also in many Iguanidae, Scinddae, and evenrin&nbsp;the Anelytropidae; their numbers vary much, from 27 in the&nbsp;Scincoid </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Acontias meleagris,</span><span class="font0"> 7-10 in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Polychrus,</span><span class="font0"> S in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chamaeleo</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
