<p><span class="font2">Two forms of the Referendum should be carefully distin-guished: the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">facultative</span><span class="font2"> or optional (brought into play only on the demand of a fixed number of citizens), and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">obligatory&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">or compulsory (which obtains in all cases that lie within its&nbsp;sphere as defined in the constitution). The Initiative exists&nbsp;only in the facultative form, being exercised when a certain&nbsp;number of citizens demand it. Both came into common use&nbsp;during the Liberal reaction in Switzerland after the Paris&nbsp;revolution of July 1830. In 1831 St Gall first adopted the&nbsp;“ facultative referendum ” (then and for some time after called&nbsp;the “ Veto ’’), and its example was followed by several cantons&nbsp;before 1848. The “obligatory referendum ” appears first in&nbsp;1852 and 1854 respectively in the Valais and the Grisons, when&nbsp;the older system was reformed, but in its modern form it was&nbsp;first adopted in 1863 by the canton of rural Basel. The&nbsp;Initiative was first adopted in 1845 by Vaud. Of course the&nbsp;cantons with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Landsgemeinden,</span><span class="font2"> Uri, Unterwalden, Appenzell&nbsp;and Glarus (where the citizens appear in person) possessed both&nbsp;from time immemorial. Excluding these there were at the end&nbsp;of 1907 9</span><span class="font0">½</span><span class="font2"> cantons, which had the “ obligatory referendum ”&nbsp;(Aargau, rural Basel, Bern, the Grisons, Schafthausen, Schwyz,&nbsp;Soleure, Thurgau, the Valais and Zürich), while 7</span><span class="font0">½</span><span class="font2"> cantons possess only the “ facultative referendum ” (Basel town, Geneva,&nbsp;Lucerne, Neuchâtel, St Gall, Ticino, Vaud and Zug). Fribourg&nbsp;alone had neither, save an obligatory referendum (like all the&nbsp;rest) as to the revision of the cantonal constitution. As regards&nbsp;the Initiative, all the cantons have it as to the revision of the&nbsp;cantonal constitution; while all but Fribourg have it also as&nbsp;to bills or legislative projects. In the case both of the facultative&nbsp;referendum and of the Initiative each canton fixes the number&nbsp;of citizens who have a right to exercise this power. The constitution of the Swiss confederation lags behind those of the&nbsp;cantons. It is true that both in 1848 (art. 113) and in 1874&nbsp;(art. 120) it is provided that a vote on the question whether the&nbsp;constitution shall be revised must take place if either house of&nbsp;the federal legislature or 50,000 qualified voters demand it—&nbsp;of course a popular vote (obligatory referendum) must take&nbsp;place on the finally elaborated project of revision. But as&nbsp;regards bills the case is quite different. The “ facultative&nbsp;referendum ” was not introduced till 1874 (art. 89) and then&nbsp;only as regards all bills and resolutions not being of a pressing&nbsp;nature, 8 cantons or 30,000 qualified voters being entitled to&nbsp;ask for such a popular vote. But the Initiative did not appear&nbsp;in the federal constitution till it was inserted in 1891 (art. 121),&nbsp;and then merely in the case of a partial (not a total) revision of&nbsp;the constitution, if 50,000 qualified voters require it, whether as&nbsp;regards a subject in general or a draft bill,—of course the federal&nbsp;legislature had an Initiative in this matter in 1848 already.&nbsp;The results of the working of these two institutions in federal&nbsp;matters up to the end of 1908 are as follows. Excluding the&nbsp;votes by which the two federal constitutions of 1848 and 1874&nbsp;were adopted, there have been 30 (10 of them between 1848 and&nbsp;1874) votes (obligatory referendum) as to amendments of the&nbsp;federal constitution; in 15 cases only (of which only one was&nbsp;before 1874) did the people accept the amendment proposed.&nbsp;In the case of bills there have been 30 votes (very many bills&nbsp;have not been attacked at all), all of course since the facultative&nbsp;referendum was introduced in 1874; in 11 cases only have the&nbsp;people voted in the affirmative. Finally, with regard to the&nbsp;Initiative, there have been 7 votes, of which twt&gt; only were in the&nbsp;affirmative. Thus, between 1874 and 1907, of 57 votes 27 only&nbsp;were in the affirmative, while if we include the 10 votes&nbsp;between 1848 and 1874 the figures are respectively 67 and&nbsp;28, one only having been favourable during that period.&nbsp;The result is to show that the people, voting after mature&nbsp;reflection, are far less radically disposed than has sometimes&nbsp;been imagined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The method of referendum by itself is also in use in some of the states of the American Union (see United States)&nbsp;and in Australia, and under the name of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">plébiscite</span><span class="font2"> has been&nbsp;employed in France; but it is best studied in the Swiss constitution.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">REFLECTION OF LIGHT. When a ray of light in a homogeneous medium falls upon the bounding surface of another medium, part of it is usually turned back or reflected and part&nbsp;is scattered, the remainder traversing or being absorbed by the&nbsp;second medium. The scattered rays (also termed the irregularly or diffusely reflected rays) play an important part in&nbsp;rendering objects visible—in fact, without diffuse reflection&nbsp;non-luminous objects would be invisible; they are occasioned&nbsp;by irregularities in the surface, but are governed by the same&nbsp;law as holds for regular reflection. This law is: the incident&nbsp;and reflected rays make equal angles with the normal to the&nbsp;reflecting surface at the point of incidence, and are coplanar&nbsp;with the normal. This is equivalent to saying that the path&nbsp;of the ray is a minimum.@@<sup>1</sup> In fig. 1 , MN represents the section&nbsp;of a plane mirror; OR is the incident ray, RP the reflected ray,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">and TR the normal at R. Then</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the law states that the angle of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">incidence ORT equals the angle</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">of reflection PRT, and that</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">OR, RT and RP are in the same</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">plane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This natural law is capable of ready experimental proof (a simple&nbsp;one is to take the altitude of a&nbsp;star with a meridian circle, its depression in a horizontal reflecting surface of mercury and the direction of the nadir),&nbsp;and the most delicate instruments have failed to detect&nbsp;any divergence from it. Its explanation by the Newtonian&nbsp;corpuscular theory is very simple, for we have only to&nbsp;assume that at the point of impact the perpendicular velocity&nbsp;of a corpuscle is reversed, whilst the horizontal velocity&nbsp;is unchanged (the mirror being assumed horizontal). The&nbsp;wave-theory explanation is more complicated, and in the&nbsp;simple form given by Huygens incomplete. The theory as&nbsp;developed by Fresnel shows that regular reflection is due&nbsp;to a small zone in the neighbourhood of the point R (above),&nbsp;there being destructive interference at all other points on&nbsp;the mirror; this theory also accounts for the polarization&nbsp;of the reflected light when incident at a certain angle (see&nbsp;Polarization of Light). The smoothness or polish of the surface largely controls the reflecting power, for, obviously, crests&nbsp;and furrows, if of sufficient magnitude, disturb the phase&nbsp;relations. The permissible deviation from smoothness depends&nbsp;on the wave-length of the light employed: it appears that&nbsp;surfaces smooth to within ⅛th of a wave-length reflect regularly;&nbsp;hence long waves may be regularly reflected by a surface&nbsp;which diffuses short waves. Also the obliquity of the incidence&nbsp;would diminish the effect of any irregularities; this is experi-mentally confirmed by observing the images produced by&nbsp;matt surfaces or by smoked glass at grazing incidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We now give some elementary constructions of reflected rays, or, what comes to the same thing, of images formed&nbsp;by mirrors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1. If O be </span><span class="font2">a luminous point and </span><span class="font1">OR </span><span class="font2">a ray incident at R </span><span class="font1">on the plane mirror MN (fig. 1) to determine the reflected ray and the&nbsp; image of O. If RP be the reflected ray and RT perpendicular</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> This principle of the minimum path, however, only holds for plane and convex surfaces; with concave surfaces it may be a&nbsp;maximum in certain cases.</span></p>
