The original meaning, derived from the Med. Lat. translation <hi rend="italic">figura,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">σχήμα,</hi> is that of a diagram or figure to illustrate a mathematical proposition and the like, a map or plan, &amp;amp;c., thus used of an analysis, a tabular statement; an epitome or synopsis, a table or system of classification. In Kantian philosophy, “ Schema ” is used of “ the product of the exercise of the transcendental imagination in giving generality to sense and particularity to thought,” and “ schematism of the theory, in the Kantian analysis of knowledge, of the use of the transcendental imagination as mediating between sense and understanding ” (Baldwin, <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology,</hi> 1902, vol. ii.).</p></div></body></text></TEI>
