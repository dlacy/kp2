<p><span class="font0">RADNOR, NEW, a market and borough town in the county of Radnor, in South Wales, 159 miles from London.&nbsp;It was formerly defended by a strong castle at the entrance&nbsp;of the pass between the two hills in which it is built, but&nbsp;that was destroyed by Owen Glendower in the reign of&nbsp;Henry IV. It is still a borough, and has a market which is&nbsp;held on Saturday. The population was in 1801, 329 ; in&nbsp;1811, 380 ; in 1821, 426 ; and in 1831, 472. It now returns&nbsp;one member conjointly with the boroughs of Knighton,&nbsp;Rhayadyr, Cefn-llys, and Crwclas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RADNORSHIRE, an inland county of South Walcs, bounded on the north by Montgomeryshire, on the west by&nbsp;the counties of Cardigan and Brecon, on the south-east by&nbsp;Herefordshire, and on the north-east by Shropshire. Its extremities from east to west are twenty miles, and from north&nbsp;to south twenty-four miles, as under. Its surface is computed to measure 426 square miles, or 272,640 English statute acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The population in 1811, amounted to 20,900 souls, in 1821 to 22,503, and in 1831 to 24,651, of whom 12,453&nbsp;were males, and 12,198 females. The total sum charged to&nbsp;the property tax in 1811, under the heads of rents of land&nbsp;and tithes, was, for the former, L.88,250, and for the latter,&nbsp;L.9373. On comparing these numbers with the other returns of Great Britain, it appears that this county is the&nbsp;lowest in numerical population, except the county of Rutland ; although its annual rental is higher than either Anglesey or Merioneth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This district of country continued under the jurisdiction of the Lords Marchers, until it obtained the privilegesof a county&nbsp;by act of Henry VIII., and was divided into the hundreds of&nbsp;Radnor, Knighton, Painscastle, Rhayder, Coluyn, and Ke-venlleece. By the same act it was also empowered to return two members to Parliament, one for the county, and&nbsp;one for the contributory boroughs of Radnor, Rhayder,&nbsp;Knighton, Knuclas, and Kevenlleece. The county is further divided into parishes and townships. The former are&nbsp;fifty-two in number, and are all in the diocese of St. David’s,&nbsp;except five, which are included in the English diocese of&nbsp;Hereford. New Radnor, said to have been at one period&nbsp;the principal town, is now a very poor village ; it was an&nbsp;ancient borough by prescription, and has also had charters&nbsp;granted by Queen Elizabeth, and by George II.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Two-thirds of the whole area of the county are supposed to be unenclosed and uncultivated. An extensive mountainous&nbsp;tract, nearly in the centre, Is usually called the Forest, though&nbsp;there is no reason to believe it was ever covered with trees. A&nbsp;part of this range still belongs to the Crown, although the forests of Radnor and Blathvagh have both been alienated,&nbsp;and are now held by Mr-Thornas Frankland Lewis, and Mr.&nbsp;Richard Price, as foresters. There is nothing remarkable in&nbsp;the circumstances or character of these mountains, the summit of which was ascertained by Colonel Mudge, to be 2163&nbsp;feet above the level of the sea. Within their limits is a torrent, called by a name, which, when translated, is “ Water-break-its-neck,” that falls abruptly from a height of about&nbsp;150 feet. The higher ranges produce only heath, but the&nbsp;sides and lower parts of the hills, which are less exposed to&nbsp;the winds, are entirely devoted to the pasturage of sheep and&nbsp;small horses. The north-western angle of the county is&nbsp;mountainous and unenclosed, and it was in the recesses of&nbsp;these wilds, that the British monarch, Vortigern, retreated&nbsp;from the Saxons. On the eastern and southern districts,&nbsp;the valleys are wider and more fertile, and abound with&nbsp;small rivulets; but the hills are less elevated, and are partially&nbsp;clothed with wood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The soil of this country is as varied in quality as its position differs in elevation. A small portion of the southern angle is composed of the fertile red earth which prevails in&nbsp;the adjoining counties of Brecon and Hereford. The mountains upon the western side are chiefly of the primary slate&nbsp;rocks which abound in Wales ; and the valleys between&nbsp;these and the forest have frequently a clayey substratum retentive of water. The forest, and the other subordinate hills&nbsp;connected with it, consist of a slatey rock, containing a portion of lime, which decomposes rapidly on exposure to the&nbsp;atmosphere. The valleys to the eastward of this range are&nbsp;chiefly of a fertile loamy soil, incumbent on an extremely&nbsp;absorbent gravel. The climate is wet and stormy, and the&nbsp;spring months are particularly cold and ungenial. It is, nevertheless, healthy ; there are no peculiar or prevalent diseases, and the inhabitants are robust and long-lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The principal river is the Wye, which enters the county at Savan y Coed, and flows to the south till it divides it&nbsp;from Brecon. Its tributary streams are the Elan, the Ithon,&nbsp;the Edda, and the Mackwy. The river Terne flows on the&nbsp;eastern border, and continues its course by Ludlow to the&nbsp;Severn. The Lug and the Arrow, in the more central parts,&nbsp;form considerable streams before they enter the county of&nbsp;Hereford. There are some small lakes or pools requiring&nbsp;notice only as contributing to the beauty of the scenery.&nbsp;These are, Llyn, Llanbychllyn, Hendwell Pool, and Llyn-Gwyn. A cataract at Rhayader, was formerly an object&nbsp;much visited by travellers ; but the construction of a bridge&nbsp;has widened the channel, and deprived it of much of its remarkable character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The agriculture of the county is gradually improving. Irrigation has long been practised to a considerable extent,&nbsp;and its effects on absorbent soils are found to be highly beneficial ; but the process is not conducted in the most scientific manner. Lime is abundantly used as a manure, and&nbsp;is chiefly supplied from a valuable stratum of rock near Old&nbsp;Radnor. The ploughing was usually performed by two oxen&nbsp;and two horses ; but oxen are now seldom used, and the&nbsp;plough with two horses is in gradual adoption. The implements of husbandry are, for the most part, in a rude form.&nbsp;Most of the farms consist of an equal portion of arable and&nbsp;of grass land. The latter is generally appropriated to the&nbsp;dairy, and the young cattle are reared on the more hilly and&nbsp;barren spots. About one-fifth of the county is under the&nbsp;plough, and one-tenth meadow ; the remainder is generally&nbsp;used for sheep walks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the mountainous districts the cattle differ little from those which are common in the principality of Wales, but&nbsp;in the more fertile parts, the Herefordshire breed prevails.&nbsp;The sheep are small, and when fattened, their mutton is excellent; the horses also are generally small, strong, and hardy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is little commerce carried on in this county, and the only manufactures are of flannels and coarse woollen cloths, which the inhabitants make for their own use.&nbsp;Cattle, sheep, horses, woollen, butter, and, from the southeast districts, a surplus of grain, are sent annually to the&nbsp;markets of England. The county is not known to contain&nbsp;any valuable minerals. A lead mine has been opened and&nbsp;abandoned, and, in some places, an uncertain belief has prevailed of the existence of copper. Various mineral springs&nbsp;are known, and Llandrindad is a place of resort on account&nbsp;of the medicinal qualities of its saline, sulphureous, and chalybeate wells. In several other parts there are similar springs,&nbsp;the properties of which have not been accurately ascertained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Radnorshire there are many vestiges of antiquity. The Abbey of Cwm Hir stood formerly in a singularly retired and&nbsp;romantic situation on the banks of a rivulet which runs into&nbsp;the Wye. A small vestige remains of a castle at New Radnor, which was assailed and destroyed “ by the irregular and&nbsp;wild Glendower,” previously to the battle noticed by Shak-speare, in the first part of Henry IV., when Mortimer was&nbsp;taken prisoner. It was fought at Pilleth in this county.</span></p>
