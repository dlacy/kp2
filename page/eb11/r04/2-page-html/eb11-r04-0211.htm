<p><span class="font2">and brought out a volume of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cent Croquis pour réjouir les Honnêtes Gens.</span><span class="font2"> His last piece of work, an advertisement of an&nbsp;exhibition, was done in November 1896. Rops died on the&nbsp;23rd of August 1898, at Essonnes, Seine-et-Oise, on the estate&nbsp;he had purchased, where he lived in complete retirement with&nbsp;his family. Scorning display, Rops almost always opposed&nbsp;any exhibition of his works. However, he consented to join the&nbsp;Art Society of the “ XX.,” formed at Brussels in 1884, as their&nbsp;revolutionary views were in harmony with the independence of&nbsp;his spirit. After his death, in 1899, the Libre Esthétique,&nbsp;which in 1894 had succeeded the “XX.,” arranged a retrospective exhibition, which included about fifty paintings and&nbsp;drawings by Rops. Rops was a Chevalier of the Legion&nbsp;of Honour. He excelled in these three</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">methods of artistic expression; but his engraved work is the most important,&nbsp;both as to mastery of technique and&nbsp;originality of ideas, though in all his&nbsp;talent was exceedingly versatile. Hardly&nbsp;any artist of the 19th century equalled&nbsp;him in the use of the dry-point and soft&nbsp;varnish. By his assured handling and admirable draughtsmanship, as well as the variety of his sometimes wildly fantastic&nbsp;■conceptions, he made his place among the great artists of his&nbsp;time. “ Giving his figures a character of grace which never&nbsp;lapses into limpness,” says his biographer, E. Ramiro, “ he&nbsp;has analysed and perpetuated the human form in all the elegance&nbsp;and development impressed on it by modem civilization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1896 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Plume</span><span class="font2"> (Paris) devoted a special number to this artist, fully illustrated, by which the public were made aware how many of&nbsp;his works are unsuitable for display in the drawing-room or boudoir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">E. Deman, the publisher at Brussels, brought out a volume in 1897 with the title, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Félicien Rops et son œuvre—</span><span class="font2">papers by various writers.&nbsp;We may also mention a study of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Félicien Rops,</span><span class="font2"> by Eugène Demolder&nbsp;(Paris, Princebourde, 1894), and another by the same writer in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Trois Contemporains</span><span class="font2"> (E Deman, 1901); </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Les Ropsiaques,</span><span class="font2"> by Pierre&nbsp;Gaume, brought out in London, 1898; and the admirable notice&nbsp;by T. K. Huysmans in his volume called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Certains.</span><span class="font2"> (O. M.*)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROQUELAURE, a title derived from a small commune in France (dep. of Gers), and home by a French family of Armagnac,&nbsp;■one member of which was Antoine, baron de Roquelaure (1544-1625), who was in the service of Henry IV. before he became&nbsp;king, and after his accession was made master of the wardrobe,&nbsp;lieutenant-general in Auvergne (1576) and Guienne (1610), and&nbsp;marshal of France in 1614. His son, Gaston Jean Baptiste&nbsp;-de Roquelaure (1617-1683), a celebrated wit, was created duke&nbsp;and peer of France in 1652, and was appointed governor of&nbsp;Guienne in 1679. Gaston’s son, Antoine Gaston Jean Baptiste&nbsp;de Roquelaure (1656-1738), carried on the family reputation ‘&nbsp;for wit, and, in spite of his military incapacity, received the&nbsp;marshal’s bâton in 1724.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RORQUAL, a whale of a long and elongated shape, with a small back-fin and a number of longitudinal pleatings or folds&nbsp;on the throat (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cetacea).</span><span class="font2"> The name rorqual refers to these&nbsp;folds, while the alternative title of finner, or fin-whale, marks i&nbsp;an important difference between these w’hales (for there are 1&nbsp;several species) and right-whales. The furrows on the throat :&nbsp;are numerous and close-set, the flipper is comparatively small, ¡&nbsp;and the dorsal fin distinct. The head is relatively small, flat 1&nbsp;and pointed in front, the whalebone short and coarse, the ]&nbsp;body long and slender, and the tail much compressed before it &lt;&nbsp;expands into the “flukes.” Rorquals are the most abundant :&nbsp;and widely distributed of all whales, being found in all seas,&nbsp;except the extreme Arctic and Antarctic regions. There are &lt;&nbsp;four distinct species of this genus in British seas. Firstly, £&nbsp;Sibbald’s rorqual, or blue whale </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{Balaenoplera sibbaldi),</span><span class="font2"> the ]&nbsp;largest of all animals, attaining a length of 80 or even sometimes ]&nbsp;85 ft. Its colour is dark bluish grey, with small whitish spots ;&nbsp;on the breast; the whalebone is black; the flippers are larger &lt;&nbsp;proportionally than in other rorquals, measuring one-seventh &lt;&nbsp;•of the total length of the body; and the dorsal fin is small and f&nbsp;;placed far back. This whale has usually 64 vertebrae, of which £&nbsp;16 bear ribs. Like the others, this species seems to pass the 1</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2">winter in the open seas, and approaches the coast of Norway at the end of April or beginning of May. At this time its sole&nbsp;food is a small crustacean </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Euphausia inermis),</span><span class="font2"> which swarms in&nbsp;the fjords. Secondly, we have the common rorqual (B. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mus-culus,</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B. physalus)</span><span class="font2"> with a length of from 65 ft. to 70 ft.,&nbsp;and of a greyish slate-colour above and white underneath, and&nbsp;the whalebone slate-colour, variegated with yellow or brown.&nbsp;It has usually 62 vertebrae, of which 15 bear ribs. This is the&nbsp;commonest of all the large whales on the British coasts; scarcely&nbsp;a winter passing without the body of one being washed ashore,&nbsp;usually after stormy weather, and frequently on the south coast,&nbsp;as this species has a more southern range than the last, and enters&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the Mediterranean* It feeds lnreelv nn fish, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">and is frennentlv</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">seen feasting among shoals of herrings. Thirdly comes Rudolphi’s rorqual (B. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">borealis),</span><span class="font2"> a smaller species, scarcely attaining a&nbsp;length of 50 ft. It is bluish black above, with oblong light-coloured spots, whilst the under-parts are more or less white;&nbsp;the whole of the tail and both sides of the flippers are black;&nbsp;the whalebone is black, and the bristly ends fine, curling and&nbsp;white; the flippers are very small, measuring one-eleventh of&nbsp;the total length of the body. There are 56 vertebrae, with&nbsp;14 pairs of ribs. This species, according to Dr. C. Collett, feeds&nbsp;chiefly on minute crustaceans, mainly </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Calanus finmarchicus&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eujphausia inermis,</span><span class="font2"> and not on fish. Down to the last&nbsp;quarter of the 19th century it was considered the rarest of the&nbsp;whales of European seas, and was only known from a few&nbsp;individuals stranded on the coasts of northern Europe at long&nbsp;intervals. The most southern point at which it has been met&nbsp;with is Biarritz. Since the establishment of the whaling station&nbsp;near the North Cape it has been shown to be a regular summer&nbsp;visitor. Lastly, the lesser rorqual, B. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rostrata,</span><span class="font2"> the sharp-nosed&nbsp;finner of American whalers, is the smallest species found in&nbsp;the northern seas, rarely exceeding 30 ft. in length. Its colour&nbsp;is greyish black above, whilst the under-side is white, including&nbsp;the whole of the lower side of the tail; the inner side of the flippers&nbsp;is also white, and there is a broad white band across the outer&nbsp;side, which is a very characteristic mark of the species; the&nbsp;whalebone is yellowish white. The dorsal fin in this and the&nbsp;preceding species is comparatively high, and placed far forwards&nbsp;on the body. This whale has usually 48 vertebrae, of which&nbsp;1 r bear ribs. It is common in summer in the fjords of Norway,&nbsp;and is often seen around the British Isles. It has been taken,&nbsp;though rarely, in the Mediterranean, and ranges as far north as&nbsp;Davis Strait.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rorquals are met with in almost all seas, and nearly all the individuals carefully examined, whether from the North Pacific,&nbsp;the Australian seas or the Indian Ocean, come very near in&nbsp;structure to one or the other of the Atlantic forms described&nbsp;above, so much so that some zoologists believe that there are&nbsp;but four species, with an almost cosmopolitan range. Other&nbsp;naturalists, on the contrary, have described and named almost&nbsp;every individual specimen captured as belonging to a different&nbsp;species. See </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Whale</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hump-back Whale.</span><span class="font2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(R.

<p><span class="font2">RORSCHACH, a busy commercial town in the Swiss canton of St Gall, situated on the south-west shore of the Lake of Constance, and by rail 62 m. N.E. of Zürich, 10 m. S.E. of Romans-hom and 57 m. N. of Coire. In 1900 its population was 9140,&nbsp;mostly German-speaking, while there were 5935 Romanists to&nbsp;3139 Protestants. From 1408 to 1798 it belonged to the abbot&nbsp;of St Gall, and then to the canton Santis (named canton of St&nbsp;Gall in 1803) of the Helvetic Republic. It has always been a&nbsp;great commercial centre, though now superseded by Romanshorn&nbsp;as regards the corn trade. It has many industrial establishments, of which the chief is one for the manufacture of lace and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
