<p><span class="font0">the Tummel and the Ericht, and the principal lakes Loch Rannoch and Loch Lydoch, or Laidon (about 6 m. long, ¾ m.&nbsp;wide and 924 ft. above the sea). Loch Rannoch lies E. and&nbsp;W., measures 9¾ m. long by fully 1 m. broad, is 668 ft. above&nbsp;the sea, covers an area of nearly 7½ sq. m., and has a greatest&nbsp;depth of 440 ft. It receives the Ericht and many other&nbsp;streams, and discharges by the Tummel, draining a total area&nbsp;of 243½ sq. m. At the head of the lake is Rannoch Barracks, so&nbsp;named because it was originally built to accommodate a detachment of troops, under ensign (afterwards Sir) Hector Munro,&nbsp;stationed here to maintain order after the Jacobite rising of 1745.&nbsp;Two miles east is Carie, which was the residence of Alexander&nbsp;Robertson, 13th baron of Struan (1670-1749), the Jacobite&nbsp;and poet, who was “out” with Dundee (1689), Mar (1715)&nbsp;and Prince Charles Edward (1745), and yet managed to escape&nbsp;all punishment beyond self-imposed exile to France after the&nbsp;first two rebellions. Kinloch Rannoch, at the foot of the loch,&nbsp;is the principal place in the district, and is in communication&nbsp;by coach with Struan station (13 m. distant) on the Highland,&nbsp;and Rannoch station (6 m.) on the West Highland railway.&nbsp;Dugald Buchanan (1716-1768), the Gaelic poet, was school-master of the village for thirteen years, and a granite obelisk&nbsp;has been erected to his memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RANSOM (from Lat. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">redemptio,</span><span class="font0"> through Fr. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rançon),</span><span class="font0"> the price for which a captive in war redeemed his life or his freedom, a&nbsp;town secured immunity from sack, and a ship was repurchased&nbsp;from her captors. The practice of taking ransom arose in the&nbsp;middle ages, and had perhaps a connexion with the common&nbsp;Teutonic custom of commuting for crimes by money payments.&nbsp;It may, however, have no such historic descent. The desire to&nbsp;make profit out of the risks of battle, even when they were&nbsp;notably diminished by the use of armour, would account for it&nbsp;sufficiently. The right to ransom was recognized by law. One&nbsp;of the obligations of a feudal tenant was to contribute towards&nbsp;paying the ransom of his lord. England was taxed for the&nbsp;ransom of Richard the Lion Hearted, France for King John&nbsp;taken at Poitiers, and Scotland for King David when he was&nbsp;captured at Durham. The prospect of gaining the ransom of&nbsp;a prisoner must have tended to diminish the ferocity of medieval&nbsp;war, even when it did not reduce the fighting between the&nbsp;knights to a form of athletic sport in which the loser paid a&nbsp;forfeit. Readers of Froissart will find frequent mention of this&nbsp;decidedly commercial aspect of the chivalrous wars of the time.&nbsp;He often records how victors and vanquished arranged their&nbsp;“ financing.&quot; The mercenary views of the military adventurers&nbsp;were not disguised. Froissart repeats the story that the English&nbsp;“ free companions ” or mercenaries, who sold their services to&nbsp;the king of Portugal, grumbled at the battle of Aljubarrota in&nbsp;1385, because he ordered their prisoners to be killed, and would&nbsp;not pursue the defeated French and Spaniards, whereby they&nbsp;lost lucrative captures. The ransom of a king belonged to the&nbsp;king of the enemy by whom he was taken. The actual captor&nbsp;was rewarded at the pleasure of his lord. King Edward III.&nbsp;paid over instalments of the ransom of the king of France to the&nbsp;Black Prince, to pay the expenses of his expedition into Spain&nbsp;in 1367. Occasionally, as in the notable case of Bertrand du&nbsp;Guesclin, the ransom of a valuable knight or leader would be&nbsp;paid by his own sovereign. To trade in ransoms became a form&nbsp;of financial speculation. Sir John Fastolf in the time of King&nbsp;Henry V. is said to have made a large fortune by buying&nbsp;prisoners, and then screwing heavy ransoms out of them by&nbsp;ill-usage. The humane influence of ransom was of course confined to the knights who could pay. The common men, who&nbsp;were too poor, were massacred. Thus Lord Grey, Queen Elizabeth’s lord deputy in Ireland, spared the officers of the Spaniards&nbsp;and Italians he took at Smerwick, but slaughtered the common&nbsp;men. Among the professional soldiers of Italy in the 15th&nbsp;century the hope of gaining ransom tended to reduce war to a&nbsp;farce. They would not lose their profits by killing their opponents.&nbsp;The disuse of the practice was no doubt largely due to the&nbsp;discovery that men who were serving for this form of gain could&nbsp;not be trusted to fight seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Instances in which towns paid to avoid being plundered are innumerable. So late as the war in the Peninsula, 1808-14, it&nbsp;was the belief of the English soldiers that a town taken by storm&nbsp;was liable to sack for three days, and they acted on their conviction at Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, and San Sebastian. It was&nbsp;a question whether ransoms paid by merchant ships to escape&nbsp;were or were not among the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">commercia belli.</span><span class="font0"> In the early 18th&nbsp;century the custom was that the captain of a captured vessel&nbsp;gave a bond or “ ransom bill,’’ leaving one of his crew as ja&nbsp;hostage or “ ransomer ’’ in the hands of the captor. Frequent&nbsp;mention is made of the taking of French privateers which had&nbsp;in them ten or a dozen ransomers. The owner could be sued on&nbsp;his bond. At the beginning of the Seven Years’ War ransoming&nbsp;was forbidden by act of parliament. But it was afterwards at&nbsp;least partially recognized by Great Britain, and was generally&nbsp;allowed by other nations. In recent times—for instance in the&nbsp;Russo-Japanese War—no mention was made of ransom, and with&nbsp;the disappearance of privateering, which was conducted wholly&nbsp;for gain, it has ceased to have any place in war at sea, but the&nbsp;contributions levied by invading armies might still be accurately&nbsp;described by the name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RANTERS, an antinomian and spiritualistic English sect in the time of the Commonwealth, who may be described as the dregs&nbsp;of the Seeker movement. Their central idea was pantheistic, that&nbsp;God is essentially in every creature, but though many of them&nbsp;were sincere and honest in their attempt to express the doctrine&nbsp;of the Divine immanence, they were in the main unable to hold&nbsp;the balance. They denied Church, Scripture, the current&nbsp;ministry and services, calling on men to hearken to Christ within&nbsp;them. Many of them seem to have rejected a belief in immor-tality and in a personal God, and in many ways they resemble&nbsp;the Brethren of the Free Spirit in the 14th century. Their&nbsp;vague pantheism landed them in moral confusion, and many of&nbsp;them were marked by fierce fanaticism. How far the accusation&nbsp;of lewdness brought against them is just is hard to say, but they&nbsp;seem to have been a really serious peril to the nation. They&nbsp;were largely recruited from the common people, and there is&nbsp;plenty of evidence to show that the movement was widespread.&nbsp;The Ranters came into contact and even rivalry with the early&nbsp;Quakers, who were often unjustly associated with them. The&nbsp;truth is that the positive message of the Friends helped to save&nbsp;England from being overrun with Ranterism. Samuel Fisher, a&nbsp;Friend, writing in 1653, gives a calm and instructive account of&nbsp;the Ranters, which with other relevant information, including&nbsp;Richard Baxter’s rather hysterical attack, may be read in&nbsp;Rufus M. Jones’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in Mystical Religion</span><span class="font0"> (1909), xix. In&nbsp;the middle of the 19th century the name was often applied to the&nbsp;Primitive Methodists, with reference to their crude and often&nbsp;noisy preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RANUNCULACEAE, in botany, a natural order of Dicotyledons belonging to the subclass Polypetalae, and containing 27 genera with about 500 species, which</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">are distributed through temperate and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">cold regions but occur more especially</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">beyond the tropics in the northern hemisphere. It is well represented in Britain,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">where 11 genera are native. The plants</span></p>
