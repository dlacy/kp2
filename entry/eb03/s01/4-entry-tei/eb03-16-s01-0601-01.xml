He had a fine flow of imagination, was a complete maſter of the French and Spaniſh languages, and wrote ſeveral admired romances in imitation of the Spaniſh authors. Theſe were, The Bachelor of Salamanca, 2 vols 12mo; New Adventures of Don Quixote, 2 vols I2mo; The Devil on Two Sticks, 2 vols 12mo; and Gil Blas, 4 vols 12 mo. He produced alſo ſome comedies, and other pieces of pleaſantry; and died in 1747, in a little houſe near Paris, where he ſupported himſelf by writing.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sage</hi> (the reverend John), ſo juſtly admired by all who knew him for his claſſical learning and reaſoning powers, was born, in 1652, in the pariſh of Creich and county of Fife, North Britain, where his anceſtors had lived for ſeven generations with great reſpect though with little property. His father was a captain in Lord Duffus’s regiment, and fought for his king and country when Monk ſtormed Dundee on the 30th of Auguſt 1651.</p><p>The iſſue of the civil wars, and the loyalty of captain Sage, left him nothing to beſtow upon his ſon but a liberal education and his own principles of piety and virtue. In thoſe days the Latin language was taught in the parochial ſchools of Scotland with great ability and at a trifling expence; and after young Sage had acquired a competent knowledge of that language at one of thoſe uſeful ſeminaries, his father, without receiving from an ungrateful court any recompenſe for what he had loft in the cauſe of royalty, was ſtill able to ſend him to the univerſity of St Andrew’s, where having remained in college the uſual number of terms or ſeſſions, and performed the exerciſes required by the ſtatutes, he was admitted to the degree of maſter of arts, the higheſt honour which it appears he ever received from any univerſity.</p><p>During his reſidence in St Andrew’s he ſtudied the Greek and Roman authors with great diligence, and was likewiſe inſtructed in logic, metaphyſics, and ſuch other branches of philoſophy as then obtained in the ſchools, which, though we affect to ſmile at them in this enlightened age, he always ſpoke of as highly uſeful to him who would underſtand the poets, hiſtorians, and orators of ancient Greece, and even the fathers of the Chriſtian church. In this opinion every man will agree with him who is at all acquainted with the ancient metaphyſics, and has read the writings of Clemens Alexandrinus, Origen, Tertullian, Chryſoſtome, and other fathers of great name; for each of thoſe writers adopted the principles of ſome one or other of the philoſophical ſects, reaſoned from their notions, and often made uſe of their terms and phraſes.</p><p>When Mr Sage had taken his maſter’s degree, the narrowneſs of his fortune compelled him to accept of the ſirſt literary employment which was offered to him; and that happened to be nothing better than the office of ſchoolmaſter in the pariſh of Bingry in Fifeſhire, whence he was ſoon removed to Tippermuir in the county of Perth. In theſe humble ſtations, though he wanted many of the neceſſaries and almoſt all the comforts of life, he proſecuted his ſtudies with great ſucceſs; but in doing ſo, he unhappily imbibed the ſeeds of ſeveral diſeaſes which afflicted him through life, and notwithſtanding the native vigour of his conſtitution impaired his health and ſhortened his days. From the miſerable drudgery of a pariſh-ſchoolmaſter, he was relieved by Mr Drummond of Cultmalundie, who invited him to ſuperintend the education of his ſons, whom he accompanied firſt to the public ſchool at Perth, and afterwards to the univerſity of St Andrew’s. This was ſtill an employment by no means adequate to his merit, but it was not wholly without advantages. At Perth he gained the friendſhip and eſteem of Dr Roſe, afterwards lord biſhop of Edinburgh, and at St Andrew’s of every man capable of properly eſtimating genius and learning.</p><p>The education of his pupils was completed in 1684, when he was left with no determinate object of purſuit. In this moment of indeciſion, his friend Dr Roſe, who had been promoted from the parſonage of Perth to the profefforſhip of divinity in the univerſity which he was leaving, recommended him ſo effectually to his uncle then archbiſhop of Glaſgow, that he was by that prelate admitted into orders and preſented to one of the churches in the city. He was then about 34 years of age, had ſtudied the Scriptures with great aſſiduity, was no ſtranger to eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, or the apologies and other writings of the ancient fathers, was thorough maſter of ſchool-divinity, had examined with great accuracy the modern controverſies, eſpecially thoſe between the Romiſh and reformed churches, and between the Calvſhiſts and Remonſtrants; and it was perhaps to his honour that he did not fully approve of all the articles of faith ſubſcribed by any one of theſe contending ſects of Chriſtians.</p><p>A man ſo far advanced in life, and ſo thoroughly accompliſhed as a ſcholar, would naturally be looked up to by the greater part of the clergy as ſoon as he became one of their body. This was in fact the caſe: Mr Sage was, immediately on his admiſſion into orders, appointed clerk to the ſynod or preſbytery of Glaſgow; an office of great truſt and reſpectability, to which we know nothing ſιmilar in the church of England.</p><p>During the eſtabliſhment of epiſcopacy in Scotland, from the reſtoration of Charles II. till the year 1690, the authority of the biſhops, though they poſſeffed the<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0608.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0602"/>
ſole power of ordination, was very limited in the government of the church. They did every thing with the conſent of the preſbyters over whom they preſided. Dioceſan ſynods were held at ſtated times for purpoſes of the ſame kind with thoſe which employ the meetings of preſbyteries at preſent (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Presbyterians),</hi> and the only prerogative which the biſhop ſeems to have enjoyed was to be permanent preſident, with a negative voice over the deliberations of the aſſembly. The acts of each ſynod, and ſometimes the charge delivered by the biſhop at the opening of it, were regiſtered in a book kept by the clerk, who was always one of the moſt eminent of the dioceſan clergy.</p><p>Mr Sage continued in this office, diſcharging in Glaſgow all the duties of a clergyman, in ſuch a manner as endeared him to his flock, and gained him the eſteem even of thoſe who were diſſenters from the eſtabliſhment. Many of his brethren were trimmers in eccleſiaſtical as well as in civil politics. They had been republicans and preſbyterians in the days of the covenant; and, with that ferocious zeal which too often characterizes intereſted converts, had concurred in the ſeverities which, during the reign of Charles II, were exerciſed againſt the party whom they had forſaken at his reſtoration. When that party again raiſed its head during the infatuated reign of James, and every thing indicated an approaching change of the eſtabliſhment, thoſe whoſe zeal for the church had ſo lately incited them to perſecute the diſſenters ſuddenly became all gentleneſs and condeſcenſion, and advanced towards the preſbyterians as to their old friends.</p><p>The conduct of Mr Sage was the reverſe of this. He was an epiſcopalian and a royaliſt from conviction: and in all his diſcourſes public and private he laboured to inſtil into the minds of others the principles which to himſelf appeared to have their foundation in truth. To perſecution he was at all times an enemy, whilſt he never tamely betrayed through fear what he thought it his duty to maintain. The conſequence was, that in the end of the year 1688 he was treated by the rabble, which in the weſtern counties of Scotland roſe againſt the eſtabliſhed church, with greater lenity than his more complying brethren. Whilſt they, without the ſmalleſt apprehenſion of their danger, were torn from their families by a lawleſs force, and many of them perſecuted in the cruelleſt manner, he was privately warned to withdraw from Glaſgow, and never more to return to that city. So much was conſiſtency of conduct and a ſteady adherence to principle reſpected by thoſe who ſeemed to reſpect nothing elſe.</p><p>Mr Sage retired to the metropolis, and carried with him the ſynodical book, which was afterwards demanded by the preſbytery of Glaſgow, but not recovered till about three or four years ago, that, on the death of a nephew of Dr Roſe the laſt eſtabliſhed biſhop of Edinburgh, it was found in his poſſeſſion, and reſtored to the preſbytery to which it belonged. Mr Sage had detained it and given it to his dioceſan and friend, from the fond hope that epiſcopacy would ſoon be re-eſtabliſhed in Scotland; and it was doubtleſs with a view to contribute what he could to the realiſing of that hope, that, immediately on his being obliged to leave Glaſgow, he commenced a keen polemical writer. At Edinburgh he preached a while, till refilling to take the oaths of allegiance when required by the govern</p><p>ment, he was obliged to retire. In this extremity, he found protection in the houſe of Sir William Bruce, the ſheriff of Kinroſs, who approved his principles and admired his virtue. Returning to Edinburgh, in 1695, he was obſerved, and obliged to abſcond. Yet he returned in 1696, when his friend Sir William Bruce was impriſoned as a ſuſpected perſon. He was ſoon forced to look for refuge in the hills of Angus, under the name of Jackſon.</p><p>After a while Mr Sage found a ſafe retreat with the counteſs of Callendar, who employed him to inſtruct her family as chaplain, and her ſons as tutor. Theſe occupations did not wholly engage his active mind: for he employed his pen in defending his order, or in expoſing his oppreſſors. When the counteſs of Callendar had no longer ſons to inſtruct, Sage accepted the invitation of Sir John Steuart of Garntully, who wanted the help of a chaplain, and the converſation of a ſcholar. With Sir John he continued till the decency of his manners, and the extenſiveneſs of his learning, recommended him to a higher ſtation. And, on the 25th of January 1705, he was conſecrated a biſhop by Paterſon the archbiſhop of Glaſgow, Roſe the biſhop of Edinburgh, and Douglas the biſhop of Dumblain. But this promotion did not prevent ſickneſs from falling on him in November 1706. After lingering for many months in Scotland, he tried the effect of the waters of Bath in 1709, without ſucceſs. At Bath and at London he remained a twelvemonth, recogniſed by the great and careſſed by the learned. Yet though he was invited to ſtay, he returned in 1710 to his native country, which he deſired to ſee, and where he wiſhed to die. And though his body was debilitated, he engaged, with undiminiſhed vigour of mind, in the publication of the works of Drummond of Hawthornden, to which the celebrated Ruddiman lent his aid. Biſhop Sage died at Edinburgh on the 7tl1 of June 1711, lamented by his friends for his virtues, and feared by his adverſaries for his talents.</p><p>His works are, lſt, Two Letters concerning the Perſecution of the Epiſcopal Clergy in Scotland, which with other two by different authors were printed in one volume at London in 1689. 2dly, An Account of the late Eſtabliſhment of Preſbyterian Government by the Parliament of Scotland, in 1690, London, 1693. 3dly, The Fundamental Charter of Preſbytery, London,</p><p>1695. 4tl1ly, The Principles of the Cyprianick Age with regard to Epiſcopal Power and Jurisdiction, London, 1695. 5thly, A Vindication of the Principles of the Cyprianick Age, London, 1701. 6thly, Some Remarks on the Letter from a Gentleman in the City, to a miniſter in the Country, on Mr David Williamſon’s Sermon before the General Aſſembly, Edinburgh, 1703. 7thly, A Brief Examination of ſome Things in Mr Meldrum’s Sermon, preached on the 16th of May 1703, againſt a Toleration to thoſe of the Epiſcopal Perſuaſion, Edinburgh, 1703. 8thly, The Reaſonableneſs of a Toleration of thoſe of the Epiſcopal Perſuaſion inquired into purely on Church Principles, Edinburgh, 1704. 9thly, The Life of Gawin Douglas, in 1710. 10thly, An introduction to Drummond’s Hiſtory of the Five James’s, Edinburgh, 1711. Of the principles maintained in theſe publications, different readers will think very differently; and it is probable that the acrimony diſplayed in ſome of them will<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0609.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0603"/>
be generally condemned in the preſent day; whilſt the learning and acuteneſs of their author will be univer- ſally acknowledged and admired by all who can diſtinguiſh merit in a friend or an adverſary.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
