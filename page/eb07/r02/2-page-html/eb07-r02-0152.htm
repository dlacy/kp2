<p><span class="font0">tyrant. He felt he had no friend ; he knew he could not be loved ; he was content to be hated, provided he were&nbsp;feared. At length, feeling the approach of death, he named&nbsp;as his successor Caius Caligula, the only surviving son of his&nbsp;murdered nephew Germanicus. Still, though consciously&nbsp;dying, the consummate dissembler strove to deceive not&nbsp;only his courtiers, but even his physicians. Pretending to&nbsp;feel a restoration of health and strength, he made a sumptuous feast, and continued at table, as if in the height of&nbsp;enjoyment, till he was seized with a fainting fit which threatened to be mortal. His courtiers forsook him in haste to&nbsp;flock to Caligula; but Tiberius reviving, they became alarmed lest he should recover, and Macro, the captain of the&nbsp;guard, smothered the helpless wretch, whose fate was thus&nbsp;hastened by the recoil of his own deceit and cruelty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Caius Cæsar Caligula (so surnamed from the common military buskins, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">caligœ,</span><span class="font0"> which he was accustomed to wear), was joyously welcomed to the throne by both the senate&nbsp;and the people, on account of the deep love and regard still&nbsp;cherished for the memory of his father Germanicus. His&nbsp;first acts served to confirm the hopes which had been entertained of him. He liberated all the state prisoners, and&nbsp;drove from the court and senate all the spies and informers&nbsp;whom Tiberius had employed. His voyage to the islands of&nbsp;Pandataria and Pontia in the midst of tempestuous weather,&nbsp;to remove the ashes of his mother and brothers, seemed also&nbsp;an amiable proof of a sincere filial and fraternal piety. He&nbsp;restored some of the most equitable of the decrees of Augustus, which Tiberius had repealed, and gave other proofs&nbsp;of his intention to act in all respects for the promotion of&nbsp;the public welfare. But these hopeful symptoms were&nbsp;doomed to suffer an early and a fatal blight. He had been&nbsp;only about eight months on the throne when he was seized&nbsp;with a severe and dangerous illness, from which he recovered,&nbsp;so far as bodily health was concerned ; but his mental sanity&nbsp;appears to have sustained an irremediable shock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From that time forward, animal passions of the fiercest kind domineered over him uncontrolled, or, if not animal&nbsp;passions merely, with no more of intellect than was enough&nbsp;to render them fearfully malevolent. To enumerate his&nbsp;crimes would be too hideously revolting, so utterly and&nbsp;excessively unnatural were· the murders, the incests, and&nbsp;the brutalities in which this insane, or demon-possessed&nbsp;monster revelled. Murder was his daily amusement; and&nbsp;he took a fiendish delight in witnessing the dying pangs&nbsp;of his victims, whose sufferings he strove to protract, that&nbsp;they might, as he said, “ feel themselves dying.” He assumed divine honours, erected a temple to himself, and&nbsp;instituted a college of priests, to superintend the worship&nbsp;of the new god. He likewise deified one of his sisters ;&nbsp;and on her death, it was equally dangerous to rejoice in her&nbsp;divinity, and to mourn for her death. It was customary for&nbsp;him to invite his favourite horse to sup with him ; and he&nbsp;was only prevented by death from raising the animal to the&nbsp;dignity of consul. His prodigality was equally extravagant&nbsp;with his other crimes. In one year he expended the almost&nbsp;boundless wealth which had been accumulated by Tiberius,&nbsp;in shows of the most lavish and wasteful kind. One of&nbsp;these was a vast bridge of vessels at Puteoli, across an arm&nbsp;of the sea, three miles and a half broad, and so formed as&nbsp;to resemble a street at Rome. A feverish dream of military glory next seized his distempered brain ; and he made&nbsp;great preparations for an expedition against the Germans.&nbsp;Like all his undertakings, it ended in consummate folly.&nbsp;Instead of conquering Germany, he led his army to the&nbsp;sea-shore at Boulogne in France, drew out his troops in&nbsp;order of battle, then causing them to fill their helmets with&nbsp;shells, which he termed the spoils of the ocean, he returned to Rome, and demanded from the senate the honours of&nbsp;a triumph for his warlike exploits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rome at length grew sick of enduring the frantic guilt and reckless tyranny of Caligula. A conspiracy was formed against him, and he was assassinated by Cassius Chærea&nbsp;and Cornelius Sabinus, two officers of the prætorian guards.&nbsp;His body was allowed to lie for some time exposed to public&nbsp;contumely, but was finally thrown into a grave, without any&nbsp;marks of honour or respect. His wife and infant child&nbsp;were also slain by the conspirators, who thought thus&nbsp;to secure themselves against the danger of future punishment.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upon the death of Caligula, the senate began to cherish hopcs of altogether abolishing the imperial power, and restoring, if not a republican, at least an aristocratic form of&nbsp;government. But the populace had too long enjoyed the&nbsp;donations of grain, and the amusements of the amphitheatre,&nbsp;supplied to them by dictators and emperors, to be disposed&nbsp;to favour a restoration of power to the senate. And the&nbsp;prætorian cohorts, stationed on the Quirinal hill, were too&nbsp;well aware that the continuation of their power depended&nbsp;upon the continuation of a monarchy, to be willing to tolerate any such revolution. Numbers of the conspirators, or&nbsp;those who were suspected to be such, were slain by the excited populace and tlle soldiers ; and when the soldiers&nbsp;accidentally discovered Tiberius Claudius, brother of Germanicus, and uncle of the late emperor, they dragged him&nbsp;from his hiding place, and resolved to raise him to the vacant throne. The senate found it impossible to resist ; and&nbsp;thus a person who had hitherto passed his life in unregarded obscurity, despised on account of his mental imbecility,&nbsp;was placed at the head of the empire. Thus raised to the&nbsp;throne by the power of the prætorian guards, Claudius set&nbsp;the pernicious custom of rewarding their deed by granting&nbsp;them a donative. This weak man was governed, as usually&nbsp;happens, by worthless favourites, and abandoned women.&nbsp;The infamous conduct of the empress Messalina has rendered&nbsp;her name proverbial ; and her cruelty and rapacity were as&nbsp;unbounded as her licentiousness. At her instigation, it was&nbsp;but too common for the emperor to put to death some of&nbsp;the most wealthy of the nobles, and to confiscate their estates, with the money arising from which she pampered her&nbsp;numerous paramours. To such a pitch of unblushing effrontery did this abandoned woman proceed, that she at length&nbsp;openly married Silius, a noble youth, one of the partners of&nbsp;her crimes, purposing to complete her guilt by the murder&nbsp;of the emperor ; but Claudius having received private information, gave orders for her death, and she was slain in&nbsp;the gardens which she had so long polluted by her unequalled criminality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Messalina had accompanied Claudius in an expedition to Britain, and given birth to a son named Britannicus,&nbsp;whom he exhibited to the army as his destined successor in&nbsp;the empire. This expedition was occasioned by the previous success of one led by the prætor Aulus Plautius, and&nbsp;by Vespasian, who, after a succession of severe battles, subdued all the country south of the Thames. After the emperor’s return to Rome, Ostorius Scapula continued to conduct&nbsp;the war in Britain with great vigour and success, extended&nbsp;the province to the banks of the Severn, and finally succeeded in taking prisoner the celebrated Caractacus, or Ca-radoc, who had so long withstood the power of Rome. The&nbsp;native grandeur of soul displayed by this comparatively&nbsp;rude hero, excited in the mind of Claudius so much admiration, that he ordered his fetters to be struck off, and treated him with the most marked distinction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The fall of Messalina was brought about in a great measure through the intervention of Narcissus, the emperor’s freedman, who, alongwith Pallas, another manumitted slave,&nbsp;engrossed the chief favour of the weak-minded sovereign&nbsp;of Rome. The power wielded by this race of men, was a&nbsp;new feature in the degeneracy of the imperial court, but</span></p>
