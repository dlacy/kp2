<p><span class="font2">his project ; but the event forced him at last to devote himself to that career of literary labour in which the real&nbsp;success of his life was achieved. He wrote for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harbinger</span><span class="font2"> during the year of its continuance, but in 1849 he&nbsp;joined the staff of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Tribune,</span><span class="font2"> founded eight years before&nbsp;by Horace Greeley in New York, and in a short time&nbsp;became its literary editor. This position, which, through&nbsp;his steadiness, scholarly conservatism, and freedom from&nbsp;caprice as a critic, soon became one of great influence, he&nbsp;held until his death on July 4, 1880.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the greater part of the time of his connexion with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Tribune,</span><span class="font1"> Ripley was also the adviser of a leading publishing house,&nbsp;an occasional contributor to the magazines, and a co-operator in&nbsp;several literary undertakings. The chief of these, and the most&nbsp;lasting work that bears his name, λvas the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">American Cyclopædia.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Begun under the editorship of Ripley and Charles A.

It proved exceedingly popular ; and its commercial success&nbsp;led the publishers to undertake a complete revision of it ten years&nbsp;later—still under the same editors—the result of which, with the&nbsp;dropping of the word “new” from the title, was the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">American&nbsp;Cyclopaedia</span><span class="font1"> now before the public.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RIPON, a cathedral city and borough in the West Riding of Yorkshire, is situated at the confluence of the&nbsp;Ure with the Laver and the Skell, and on the Great&nbsp;Northern Railway, 22 miles north-west of York and 11&nbsp;north of Harrogate. The Ure is crossed by a fine bridge&nbsp;of 9 arches. The streets are for the most part narrow and&nbsp;irregular, and, although most of the houses are comparatively modern, some of them still retain the picturesque&nbsp;gables characteristic of earlier times. In the spacious&nbsp;market-place there is a modern cross, erected in 1781. The&nbsp;cathedral, although not ranking among those of the first&nbsp;class, is celebrated for its fine proportions, and is of great&nbsp;interest from the various styles of architecture which it&nbsp;includes. Its entire length from east to west is 266 feet,&nbsp;the length of the transepts 130 feet, and the width of the&nbsp;nave and aisles 87 feet. Besides a large square central&nbsp;tower, there are two western towers. The cathedral was&nbsp;founded on the ruins of St Wilfrid’s abbey about 680 a.d.&nbsp;in the reign of Egfrid, but of this Saxon building nothing&nbsp;now remains except the crypt, called St Wilfrid’s Needle.&nbsp;The present building was begun by Archbishop Roger&nbsp;(1154-81), and to this Transition period belong the transepts and portions of the choir. The western front and&nbsp;towers, fine specimens of Early English, were probably the&nbsp;work of Archbishop Gray (1215-55), and about the close&nbsp;of the century the eastern portion of the choir was rebuilt&nbsp;in the Decorated style. The nave and portions of the&nbsp;central tower were rebuilt towards the close of the 15th&nbsp;century in the Perpendicular style. The whole building&nbsp;underwent renovation under the direction of Sir G. G.&nbsp;Scott from 1862 to 1876 at a cost of £40,000. There&nbsp;are a number of monuments of historical and antiquarian&nbsp;interest. The bishop’s palace, a modern building in the&nbsp;Tudor style, is situated in extensive grounds about a mile&nbsp;from the town. The principal secular buildings are the&nbsp;town-hall, the public rooms, and the mechanics’ institution.&nbsp;There are several old charities, including the hospital of St&nbsp;John the Baptist founded by the archbishop of York in&nbsp;1109, the hospital of St Mary Magdalene for women founded&nbsp;by the archbishop of York in 1341, and the hospital of&nbsp;St Anne founded about the time of Edward IV. by an&nbsp;unknown benefactor. From an early period till the 16th&nbsp;century Ripon was celebrated for its manufactures of&nbsp;woollen cloth. After this industry declined the town&nbsp;became so well known for its spurs that “ as true steel as&nbsp;Ripon rowels ” became a current phrase ; and both Ben&nbsp;Jonson and Da venant refer to Ripon spurs in their verses.&nbsp;This manufacture, with those of buttons and various kinds&nbsp;of hardware, continued to prosper till the beginning of the&nbsp;present century, when the rise of the mechanical industries&nbsp;in the large towns caused it to decline. The population&nbsp;of the borough (area 1580 acres) in 1871 was 6806, and&nbsp;in 1881 it was 7390.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The city is first mentioned under the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Inhrypum</span><span class="font1"> in connexion with the establishment of a monastery in 660 by Abbot Eata of Melrose. A few years after it was bestowed on St Wilfrid, who&nbsp;was elevated to the see of Northumbria. After the division of the&nbsp;bishopric in 678, a see was erected at Ripon. The city suffered&nbsp;severely in connexion with the incursions of the Danes and the&nbsp;invasion of William the Conqueror, and was burnt by Robert Bruce&nbsp;in 1319 and 1323. During the Civil War it was for a time occupied by the Parliamentary forces, but it was retaken by the Royalists&nbsp;in 1643. It was first represented in parliament in the reign of&nbsp;Edward I. it lost one of its two members in 1868, and ceased to&nbsp;be separately represented in 1885. Surrounding the town is an&nbsp;extensive district called the liberty of Ripon, over which the archbishop of York at one time exercised special jurisdiction, not yet&nbsp;altogether annulled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RIPPERDA, John William, Baron (1680-1737), a political adventurer, was born of noble parents in the&nbsp;province of Groningen in the Netherlands, in 1680, and&nbsp;was educated in the college of the Jesuits at Cologne.&nbsp;Shortly after leaving the college he married a Protestant,&nbsp;and assumed the Protestant creed. In 1715 he was sent&nbsp;by the states on an embassy to Spain. Having gained&nbsp;the favour of Philip V., he resigned the office of Dutch&nbsp;ambassador, became a penitent convert to the Catholic&nbsp;faith, and took up his permanent residence in Madrid.&nbsp;He made use of every influence to advance himself to&nbsp;the first position at court, and if possible to supplant&nbsp;Alberoni, who, provoked by his intrigues, deprived him of&nbsp;his pension and estate. After the fall of Alberoni he succeeded in ingratiating himself with the queen, Elizabeth of&nbsp;Parma. Returning from an embassy to Vienna in 1725,&nbsp;he pretended to the queen that he had effected her&nbsp;favourite scheme of betrothing her son Don Carlos to the&nbsp;eldest archduchess. His immediate elevation to a dukedom and to the office of prime minister compelled him to&nbsp;persist in this imposture. Lie was backed up by lie ;&nbsp;the nation was impoverished to furnish him with hush-money ; and he continued to try every bungling shift until,&nbsp;in May 1726, he was deprived of his offices, and sent a&nbsp;prisoner to Segovia. Making his escape after two years’&nbsp;imprisonment, he went to England. His hopes of influence there having been overthrown by the treaty of&nbsp;Seville in 1729, he finally collected his property and set&nbsp;sail for Holland, arriving at The Hague in November 1731.&nbsp;Thence he sailed to Morocco, where he was welcomed by&nbsp;the emperor Muley Abdallah, and, becoming a Mohammedan, was placed at the head of the administration of&nbsp;the country. But his royal patron was soon driven from&nbsp;the throne, and he himself was glad to escape with his head&nbsp;to Tetuan, where he could find no better employment for&nbsp;his restless spirit than that of asserting himself to be the&nbsp;last and greatest of the prophets. He died at Tetuan&nbsp;towards the end of 1737.</span></p>
