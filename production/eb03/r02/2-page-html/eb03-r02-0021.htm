<p><span class="font0">paſſed with wood; and through the wood are walks, which open beyond it upon thoſe romantic ſcenes which&nbsp;ſurround the park, and which are the glory of Pers-ſield. The Wye runs immediately below the wood:&nbsp;the river is of a dirty colour; but the ſhape of its&nbsp;courſe is very various, winding firſt in the form of a&nbsp;horſe-ſhoe, then proceeding in a large ſweep to the&nbsp;town of Chepſtowe, and afterwards to the Severn. The&nbsp;banks are high hills; in different places ſteep, bulging&nbsp;out, or hollow on the ſides; rounded, flattened, or&nbsp;irregular at top; and covered with wood, or broken&nbsp;by rocks. They are ſometimes ſeen in front; ſome-times in perſpective; falling back for the paſſage, or&nbsp;cloſing behind the bend of the river; appearing to&nbsp;meet, riſing above, or ſhooting out beyond one another. The wood which incloſes the lawn crowns an&nbsp;extenſive range of theſe hills, which overlook all thoſe&nbsp;on the oppoſite ſhore, with the country which appears&nbsp;above or between them; and winding themſelves as the&nbsp;river winds, their ſides, all rich and beautiful, are alternately exhibited; and the point of view in one ſpot&nbsp;becomes an object to the next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In many places the principal feature is a continued rock, in length a quarter of a mile, perpendicular, high,&nbsp;and placed upon a height. To reſemble mins is common to rocks : but no ruin of any lingle ſtructilre was&nbsp;ever equal to this enormous pile ; it ſeems to be the&nbsp;remains of a city ; and other ſmaller heaps ſcattered&nbsp;about it appear to be fainter traces of the former extent, and ſtrengthen the ſimilitude. It ſtretches along&nbsp;the brow which terminates the foreſt of Dean ; the&nbsp;face of it is compoſed of immenſe blocks of ſtone, but&nbsp;not rugged; the top is bare and uneven, but not&nbsp;craggy; and from the foot of it, a declivity, covered&nbsp;with thicket, ſlopes gently towards the Wye, but in&nbsp;one part is abruptly broken off by a ledge of rocks, of&nbsp;a different hue, and in a different direction. From&nbsp;the grotto it ſeems to riſe immediately over a thick&nbsp;wood, which extends down a hill below the point of&nbsp;view, acroſs the valley through which the Wye flows,&nbsp;and up the oppoſite banks, hides the river, and continues without interruption to the bottom of the rock-:&nbsp;from another ſeat it is ſeen by itſelf without even its&nbsp;baſe ; it faces another, with all its appendages about&nbsp;it ; and ſometimes the fight of it is partially intercepted&nbsp;by trees, beyond which, at a diſtance, its long line continues on through all the openings between them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another capital object is the caſtle of Chepſtowe, a noble ruin of great extent; advanced to the very edge&nbsp;of a perpendicular rock, and ſo immediately rivetted into it, that from the top of the battlements down to&nbsp;the river ſeems but one precipice : the fame ivy which&nbsp;overſpreads the face of the one, twines and cluſters&nbsp;amongſthe fragments of the other ; many towers, much&nbsp;of the walls, and large remains of the chapel, are&nbsp;(landing. Cloſe to it is a moſt romantic wooden bridge,&nbsp;very 7ιncient, very groteſque, at an extraordinary height&nbsp;above the river, and ſeeming to abut againſt the ruins&nbsp;at one end, and ſome rocky hills at the other. The&nbsp;caſtle is ſo near to the alcove at Persfield, that little&nbsp;circumſtances in it may be diſcerned ; from other ſpots&nbsp;more diſtant, even from the lawn, and from a ſhrubbery&nbsp;on the ſide of the lawn, it is diſtinctly viſible,'and always beautiful, whether it is ſeen alone, or with the&nbsp;bridge, with the town, with more or with leſs of</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">the rich meadows which lie along the banks of the Wye, to its junction three miles off with the Severn.&nbsp;A long ſweep of that river alſo, its red cliffs, and the&nbsp;fine riſing country in the counties of Somerſet and Glou∙&nbsp;ceſter, generally terminate the proſpect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Moſt of the hills about Persfield are full of rocks ; ſome are intermixed with hanging woods, aηd either&nbsp;advance a little before them, or retire· within them, and&nbsp;are backed, or overhung, or ſeparated by trees. In&nbsp;the walk to the cave, a long ſucceſſion of them is frequently ſeen in perſpective, all of a dark colour, and&nbsp;with wood in the intervals between them. In other&nbsp;parts the rocks are more wild and uncouth ; and ſometimes they Hand on the tops of the higheſt hills ; at&nbsp;other times down as low as the river ; they are home-objects in one ſpot, and appear only in the back-ground&nbsp;of another.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;»</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The woods concur with the rocks to render the ſcenes of Persfield romantic : the place everywhere&nbsp;abounds with them ; they covey the tops of the hills $&nbsp;they hang on the ſteeps ; or they fill the depths of the&nbsp;valleys. In one place they front, in another they riſe&nbsp;above, in another they fink below the point of view∣&nbsp;they are ſeen ſometimes retiring beyond each other, and&nbsp;darkening as they recede ; and ſometimes an opening&nbsp;between two is cloſed by a third at a diſtance beyond&nbsp;them. A point, called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lover's Leap,</span><span class="font0"> commands a&nbsp;continued ſurface of the thickeſt foliage, which overſpreads a vaſt hollow immediately underneath. Below&nbsp;the Chineſe ſeat the courſe of the Wye is in the ſhape of&nbsp;a horfe-ſhoe : it is on one ſide incloſed by a ſemicircular&nbsp;hanging wood ; the direct ſteeps of a table-hill ſhut it&nbsp;in on the other ; and the great rock fills the interval between them : in the midſt of this rude ſcene lies the pe-ninſula formed by the river, a mile at the leaſt in length,&nbsp;and in the higheſt ſtate of cultivation : hear the iithmus&nbsp;the ground riſes conſiderably, and thence deſcends in a&nbsp;broken ſurface, till it flattens to the water’s edge at&nbsp;the other extremity. The whole is divided into cornfields and paſtures ; they are ſeparated by hedge-rows,&nbsp;coppices, and thickets ; open clumps and ſingle trees&nbsp;ſtand out in the meadows ; and houſes and other&nbsp;buildings, which belong to the farms, are ſcattered&nbsp;amongſt them : nature ſo cultivated, ſurrounded by&nbsp;nature ſo wild, compoſe a moſt lovely Iandſcape together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The communications between theſe ſeveral points are generally by cloſe walks ; but the covert ends near&nbsp;the Chineſe ſeat ; and a path is afterwards conducted&nbsp;through the upper park to a ruſtic temple, which overlooks on one ſide ſome of the romantic views which&nbsp;have been deſcribed, and on the other the cultivated&nbsp;hills and valleys of Monmouthihire. To the rude and&nbsp;magnificent ſcenes of nature now ſucceeds a pleaſant,&nbsp;fertile, and beautiful country, divided into incloſures,&nbsp;not covered with woods, nor broken by rocks and precipices, but only varied by eaſy ſwells and gentle declivities. Yet the proſpect is not tame: the hills in it&nbsp;are high ; and it is bounded by a vaſt ſweep of the Severn, which is here viſible for many miles together, and&nbsp;receives in its courſe the Wye and the Avon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From the temple a road leads to the Windcliff, an eminence much above the reſt, and commanding the&nbsp;whole in one view. The Wye runs at the foot of the&nbsp;hill ; the peninſula lies juſt below ; the deep boſom of</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
