<p><span class="font1">settled among the Tatars and Bashkirs in Samara and Vyatka. The Bashkirs, Meshcheryaks and Teptyars rendered able service&nbsp;to the Russian government against the Khirgiz, and until 1863 they&nbsp;constituted a separate Cossack army. (6). The Khirgiz, whose true&nbsp;abodes were in Asia, in the Ishim and Khirgiz steppe. One section&nbsp;of them crossed the Urals and occupied the steppes between the&nbsp;Urak and the Volga; the remainder belong to Turkestan and&nbsp;Siberia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Mongol race is represented in Russia by the Kalmucks, who inhabit the steppes of Astrakhan between the Volga, the Don and&nbsp;the Kuma. They are Lamaists by religion and immigrated to the&nbsp;mouth of the Volga from Dzungaria, in. the 17th century, driving&nbsp;out the Tatars and Nogais, and after many wars with the Don&nbsp;Cossacks, one part of them was taken in by the Don Cossacks, so&nbsp;that even now there are among these Cossacks several Kalmuck&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sotnias QT</span><span class="font1"> squadrons. They live for the most part in tents, and&nbsp;support themselves by breeding live stock, and partly by agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Semitic race is represented by upwards of 5,000,000 Jews. They first entered Poland from Germany during the era of the&nbsp;crusades, and soon spread through Lithuania, Courland, the Ukraine,&nbsp;and, in the 18th century, Bessarabia. The rapidity with which&nbsp;they peopled certain towns </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font1"> Odessa) and the whole provinces was&nbsp;really prodigious. The law of Russia prohibits them from entering&nbsp;Great Russia, only the wealthiest and best educated enjoying this&nbsp;privilege; nevertheless they are met with everywhere, even on&nbsp;the Urals. Their chief abodes,, however, continue to be Poland, the&nbsp;W. provinces of Lithuania, White and Little Russia, and Bessarabia.&nbsp;In Russian Poland they constitute 13!% of the total population.&nbsp;In Kovno, Vilna, Mogilev, Grodno, Volhynia, Podolia, Minsk,&nbsp;Vitebsk, Kiev, Bessarabia and Kherson, they constitute, on the&nbsp;average, 12 to I7Î % of the population, while in the cities and towns&nbsp;of these governments they reach 30 to 59% of the population.&nbsp;Organized as they are into a kind of community for mutual protection and mutual help, they soon become masters of the trade&nbsp;wherever they penetrate. In the villages they are mostly innkeepers,&nbsp;intermediaries in trade and pawnbrokers. In many towns most of&nbsp;the skilled labourers and a great many of the unskilled (for instance,&nbsp;the grain-porters at Odessa and elsewhere) are Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Jews of the Karaite sect differ entirely from the orthodox Jews both in WOrship and in mode of life. They, too, are inclined to&nbsp;trade, but they also carry on agriculture successfully. Those&nbsp;inhabiting the Crimea speak Tatar, and the few who are settled&nbsp;in W. Russia speak Polish. They are on good terms with the&nbsp;Russians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of W. Europeans, the Germans only attain considerable numbers in European Russia. In the Baltic provinces they constitute the&nbsp;ennobled landlord class, and are the tradesmen and artisans in the&nbsp;towns. Considerable, numbers of Germans, tradesmen and artisans,&nbsp;settled at the invitation of the Russian government in many of the&nbsp;larger towns as early as the 16th century, and to a much greater&nbsp;extent in the 18th century. Numbers were invited in 1762 to&nbsp;settle in S. Russia, as separate, agricultural colonies, and these have&nbsp;since then gradually extended into the Don region and N. Caucasia.&nbsp;Protected as they were by the right of self-government, exempted&nbsp;from military service, and endowed with. considerable allotments&nbsp;of good land, these colonies are much wealthier than the neighbouring&nbsp;Russian peasants, from whom they have adopted the slowdy modified&nbsp;village community.. They are chiefly Lutherans, but many of them&nbsp;belong to other religious sects—Anabaptists, Moravians, Mennonites.&nbsp;During the closing years of the 19th century great numbers of&nbsp;Germans flocked into the industrial governments of Poland, namely,&nbsp;Piotrkow, Warsaw and Kalisz.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Rumanians (Moldavians) inhabit the governments of Bessarabia, Podolia, Kherson and Ekaterinoslav. In Bessarabia they constitute from one-fourth to three-fourths of the population of&nbsp;certain districts, and nearly 50% of the entire population of the&nbsp;government. On the whole the Novorossian governments (Bessarabia, Kherson, Ekaterinoslav. and Taurida) exhibit the greatest&nbsp;variety of population. Little and Great Russians, Rumanians,&nbsp;Bulgarians, Germans, Greeks, Frenchmen, Poles, Tatars and Jews&nbsp;are mingled together and scattered about in small colonies, especially&nbsp;in Bessarabia. The Greeks inhabit chiefly the towns, where they&nbsp;are traders, as also do the Armenians, scattered through the towns&nbsp;of S. Russia, and appearing in larger numbers only in the district of&nbsp;Rostov.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Lithuanians prevail in Kovno, Vilna and Suwalki; and the Letts, who are, however, more scattered, are chiefly concentrated&nbsp;in Vitebsk, Courland and Livonia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the Baltic provinces (Esthonia, Livonia and Courland) the prevailing population. is Esthonian, Kuronian or Lettish, the&nbsp;Germans being respectively only 3*8, 7*6 and 8*2 % of the population.&nbsp;The relations of the Esths and Letts with their landlords are anything but friendly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The governments of St Petersburg (apart from the capital), Olonets and Archangel contain an admixture of Karelians, Samo-yedes and Syryenians, the remainder being Great Russians. In&nbsp;the E. and 5.E. provinces of the Volga (Nizhniy-Novgorod, Simbirsk, Samara, Penza and Saratov.) the Great Russians prevail, the&nbsp;remainder being chiefly Mordvinians, Tatars, Chuvashes and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Bashkirs, Germans in Samara and Saratov, and Little Russians in the last named. In the Ural governments of Perm and Vyatka&nbsp;Great Russians are in the majority, the remainder being a variety of&nbsp;Finno-Tatars. In the S. Ural governments (Uralsk, Orenburg,&nbsp;Ufa) the admixture of Turko-Tatars—of Kirghiz in Uralsk, Bashkirs&nbsp;in Orenburg and Ufa, and less important races—becomes considerable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The state religion is that of the Orthodox Greek Church (Orthodox Catholic or Orthodox Eastern Church). Its head&nbsp;is the tsar; but although he makes and annuls all&nbsp;appointments, he does not determine questions of&nbsp;dogmatic theology. The principal ecclesiastical authority&nbsp;is the Holy Synod, the head of which, the Procurator, is one of&nbsp;the council of ministers and exercises very wide powers in&nbsp;ecclesiasticaI matters. In theory all religions may be freely&nbsp;professed, except that certain restrictions, such as domicile, @@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>are laid upon the Jews; but in actual fact the dissenting sects&nbsp;are more or less severely treated. According to returns&nbsp;published in 1905 the adherents of the different religious communities in the whole of the Russian empire numbered approximately as follows, though the heading Orthodox Greek&nbsp;includes a very great many </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Raskolniki</span><span class="font2"> or Dissenters. Indeed&nbsp;it is estimated that there are more than 12,000,000 Dissenters&nbsp;in Great Russia alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Orthodox Greek......87,123,600</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Dissenters.....* . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,204,600</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Other non-Christians.....285,300</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Total . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;125,640,020</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The ecclesiastical heads of the national Orthodox Greek Church consist of three metropolitans (St Petersburg, Moscow, Kiev),&nbsp;fourteen archbishops and fifty bishops, all drawn from the ranks of&nbsp;the monastic (celibate) clergy. The parochial clergy are celibate in&nbsp;so far as they must.be married when appointed, but if left widowers&nbsp;may not marry again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All Russians, with the exception of a number of White Russians who belong to the United Greek Church (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Roman Catholic&nbsp;Church),</span><span class="font1"> profess the Orthodox Greek faith or belong to one or other&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">the numberless dissident sects. The Poles and most of the&nbsp;Lithuanians are Roman Catholics. The Esths and all other Western&nbsp;Finns,, the Germans and the Swedes are Protestant. The Tatars,&nbsp;Bashkirs and Kirghiz are Mahommedans; but the last-named&nbsp;have to a great extent maintained along with Mahommedanism their&nbsp;old Shamanism. . The same holds good of the Meshcheryaks, both&nbsp;Moslem and Christian. The Mordvinians are nearly all Orthodox&nbsp;Greek, as also are the Votyaks, Voguls, Cheremisses and Chuvashes,&nbsp;but their religions are, in reality, modifications of Shamanism under&nbsp;the influence.of some Christian and Moslem beliefs. The Moguls,&nbsp;though baptized, are in fact believers in fetishism as much as&nbsp;the unconverted Samoyedes. Finally, the Kalmucks are Lamaite&nbsp;Buddhists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In his relations with Moslems, Buddhists and even fetishists the Russian peasant looks rather to conduct than to creed, the&nbsp;latter being in his view simply a matter of nationality. Indeed,&nbsp;towards paganism, at least, he is perhaps even more than&nbsp;tolerant, preferring on the whole to keep on good terms with&nbsp;pagan divinities. The numerous outbreaks against the Jews&nbsp;are directed, not against their creed, but against them as keen&nbsp;business men and extortionate money-lenders. Any idea of&nbsp;proselytism is quite foreign to the ordinary Russian mind,&nbsp;and the outbursts of proselytizing zeal occasionally manifested&nbsp;by the clergy are really due to the desire for “ Russification,”&nbsp;and traceabIe to the influence of the higher clergy and of the&nbsp;government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> The restrictions on domicile were to some extent relaxed in the beginning of 1907.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
