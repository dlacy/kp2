<p><span class="font0">constitute the “ running rigging,” since they are “ in constant use, to trim yards, and make or shorten sail ” (Admiral Smyth,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">op. cit.).</span><span class="font0"> The rigging must also provide the crew with the&nbsp;means of going aloft, and with standing ground to do their&nbsp;work when aloft. Therefore the shrouds (see below) are&nbsp;utilized to form ladders of rope, of which the steps arc called&nbsp;ratlines, by which the crew can mount. Near the heads of&nbsp;the lower masts are the tops—platforms on which men can&nbsp;stand—and in the same place on the topmasts are the “ cross-trees,” of which the main function is to extend the topgallant&nbsp;shrouds. The yards are provided with ropes, extending from&nbsp;the middle to the extremities or arms, called horses, or foot-ropes, which hang about 2 or 3 ft. down, and on which&nbsp;men can stand. The material of which the cordage is made&nbsp;has differed, and still differs greatly. Leather has been used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During historic times, however, the prevailing materials have been hemp or esparto grass </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Machrocloa,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Stipa tenacissima),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and in recent days chain and wire. As the whole of the rigging&nbsp;is divided into standing and running, so a rope forming part&nbsp;of the rigging is divided into the “ standing part ” and the&nbsp;“ fall.” The standing part is that which is made fast to the mast,&nbsp;deck or block. The fall is the loose end or part on which the&nbsp;crew haul. The block is the pulley through which the rope&nbsp;runs. “ Standing ” in sea language means “ fixed ”—thus the&nbsp;standing part of a hook is that which “ is attached to block,&nbsp;chain or anything which is to heave the hook up, with a weight&nbsp;hanging to it; the part opposite the point ” (Smyth, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sub voce).&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">“ Tackle ” is the combination of ropes and blocks; the combination of cables and anchors constitutes the “ ground tackle.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The function of all cordage may be said to be to pull, for the purpose either of keeping the masts in their places, or of moving&nbsp;spars and sails. The standing rigging which supports the masts</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">must be adapted to resist two kinds of pressure, the longitudinal, whether applied by the wind or by the motion of the vessel&nbsp;when pitching (t.e. plunging head and stern alternately into&nbsp;the hollow of the sea), and the lateral, when the wind is blowing on the side and she is rolling. The longitudinal pressure&nbsp;is counteracted by the bobstays, stays and backstays. A&nbsp;reference to fig. 1 will show that the bobstays hold down the&nbsp;bowsprit, which is Iiablc to be lifted by the tug of the jibs, and of&nbsp;the stays connecting it with the’ fore-topmast. If the bowsprit&nbsp;is lifted the fore-topmast loses part of its support. In the&nbsp;case of a small vessel, the lifting of a bowsprit would wreck&nbsp;her whole system of rigging in an instant. If fig. 1 is&nbsp;followed from the bow to the mizzenmast, it will be seen that&nbsp;a succession of stays connect the masts with the hull of the ship&nbsp;or with one another. All pull together to resist pressure from in front. Pressure from behind is met by the backstays, which&nbsp;connect the topmasts and topgallant masts with the sides of&nbsp;the vessel. Lateral pressure is met by the shrouds and breast-backstays. A temporary or “ preventer ” backstay is used&nbsp;when great pressure is to be met. Seamen have at all times&nbsp;had recourse to special devices to meet particular dangers.&nbsp;When Dundonald, then captain of the “ Pallas ” frigate, was&nbsp;chased by a French squadron in stormy weather, he fortified&nbsp;his masts by ordering “ all the hawsers ” (large ropes a little&nbsp;less strong than the cables which hold the anchor) “ in the ship&nbsp;to be got up to the mast heads, and hove taut,&quot; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> made fast&nbsp;to the side. Thus she was able to carry more sail than would&nbsp;have been possible with her normal rigging. The running rigging&nbsp;by which all spars and sails are hoisted, or lowered and spread&nbsp;or taken in, may be divided into those which lift and lower—&nbsp;the lifts, jeers, halliards (haulyards)—and those which hold&nbsp;down the lower corners of the sails—the tacks and sheets.
