The two conſuls were therefore impαwersd to name one of themſelves to that dignity ; whereupon Virginius readily yielded it to his colleague Poſthumius, as the more able commander. The new dictator, having created Æbutius Elva his general of the horſe, and divided his army into four bodies, left one ol them, under the command of Sempronius, to guard the city ; and with the other three, commanded by himſelf, Virginius, and Æbutius, marched out againſt the Latins, who, with an army of 40,000 foot and 30c0 horſe, under the command of f&gt;extus Tarquinius, Titus Tarquinius, and Mamilius, had already made themſe lves maſters of Corbin, a ſtrong-hold belonging to the republic, and put the garriſcn to the ſword. Poſthumius encamped in the night on a ſteep hill near the lake Rεgillus, and Virginius on another hill over-againſt him. Æbutius was ordered to march ſilently in the night, with the cavalry and light-armed infantry, to take poiſeſſion of a third hill upon the road, by which proviſions muſt be brought to the Latins.</p><p>Before Æbutius had fortified his new camp, he was vigorouſly attacked by Lucius Tarquinius, whom he rcpulſed three times with great loſs, the dictator having ſent him a timely reinforcement. After this, Æ-butius intercepted two couriers ſent by the Volſci to the Latin generals, and, by letters found upon them, diſcovered, that a conſiderable army of the Volſci and Hernici were to join the Latin forces in three days. Upon this intelligence, Poſthumius drew his three bodies of troops together, which amounted in all to no more than 24,000 toot and ιcoo horſe, with a deſign to engage the enemy before the arrival of the ſuccours they expected. Accordingly he encouraged his men, and, with his army in battle-array, advanced to the piâce where the enemy was encamped. '1 he Latins, who were much ſuperior to the Romans in numbers, and beſides began to want proviſions, did not decline the engagement. Titus Tarquinius, at the head of the Roman exiles and deſertcrs, was in the centre, Mami-hſis in the right wing, and Sextus Tarquinius in the left. In the Roman army the dictator commanded in the centre, Æbutius in the left wing, and Virginius in the right.</p><p>The firſt body which advanced was that of the dictator ; and, as ſoon as it began to march, T. Tarquinius, ſinglmg out the dictator, ran full ſpeed againſt him. The dictator did not decline the encounter, but, iiying at his adverſary, wounded him with a javelin in the right ſide. Upon this, the firſt line of the Latins advanced to cover their general ; but he being carried out of the field, they made but a faint reſiſtance when charged bv the troops of the dictator. They were deſtitute of a leader ; and therefore began to retire, when fi&gt;extus Tarquinius, taking the place of his brother, brought them back to the charge, and renewed the fight with ſuch vigour, that the victory in the centre was ſtill doubtlul. On the ſide of Mamilius and Æbutius, both parties, encouraged by the example of their leaders, fought.with incredible bravery and reſolution. After a long and bloody conteſt, the two generals »greed to determine the doubtful victory by a ſingle combat. Accordingly the champions puſlitd on their horſes againſt each other. Æbuâuâ with his lance</p><p>wounded Mamilius in the breaſt ; and Mamilius with his ſword Æbutius in the right arm. Neither of the wounds were mortal ∣ but, both generals falling from their horſes, put an end to the combat. Marcus Valerius, the brother of Poplicola, ſupplying the place of Æbutius, endeavoured, at the head of the Roman horſe, to break the enemy’s battalions ; but was repulſed by the cavalry of the Roman royaliſts. At the ſame time Mamilius appeared again in the van, with a conſiderable body of horſe and flight-armed infantry. Valerius, with the aſſiſtance of his two nephews, the ſons of Poplicola, and a choſen troop of volunteers, attempted to break through the Latin battalions, in order to engage Mamilius ; but, being ſurrounded by the Roman exiles, he received a mortal wound in hi⅜ ſide, ſell from his horſe, and died. The dead body was carried off by the two ſons of Poplicola, in ſpite of the utmoſt efforts of the exiles, and delivered to Valerius’s ſervants, who conveyed it to the Roman camp; but the young heroes being alterwards inveſted on alt ſides, and overpowered by numbers, were both killed on the ſpot. Upon their death, the left wing of the Romans began to give ground, but were ſoon brought back by Poſthumius ; who, with a body of Roman knights, flyiqg to their aſſiſtance, charged the royaliſts with ſuch fury, that they were, after an obſtinate reſiſtance, obliged to give way, and retire in the utmoſt confuſion. In the mean time Titus Horminius, one of the dictator’s lieutenants, having rallied thoſe who had fled, ſell upon ſome cloſe battalions of the enemy’3 right wing, which ſtill kept their ground under the command of Mamilius, killed him with his own hand, and put that body to flight. But while he was buſy in ſtripping the body of his enemy, he received himſelf a wound, of whichhe died ſoon after.</p><p>Sextus Tarquinius in the mean time maintained the fight with great bravery, at the head of the left wing* againſt the conſul Virginius ; and had even broke thro’ the right wing of the Roman army, when the dictator attacked him unexpectedly with his victorious ſqua-drons. ſt hen Sextus, having loſt at once all hopes of victory, threw<hi rend="sup">,</hi> himſelf, like one in deſpair, into the midſt of the Roman knights, and there ſunk under a multitude of wounds, after he had diſtinguiſhed himſelf in a moſt eminent manner. The death of the three generals was followed by the entire defeat of the Latin army. Their camp was taken and plundered, and moſt of their troops cut in pieces; for, of the 43,oco men who came into the field, ſcarce 10,000 returned home. The next morning the Volſci and Hernici came, according to their agreement, to aſſiſt the Latins ; but finding, upon their arrival, how matters had gone, ſome of them were for falling upon the Romans before they could recover from the fatigue of the preceding day ; but others thought it more ſafe to ſend ambaſſadors to the dictator, to congratulate him on his victory, and aſſure him that they had leſt their own country with no other deſign than to afliſt Rome in ſo dangerous a war. Poſthumius, by producing their courier’s and letters, gave them to underſtand that he w<hi rend="sup">,</hi>as well appriſed of their deſigns and treacherous proceedings. However, out of a regard to the law of nations, he ſent them back unhurt, with a challenge to their generals to fight the next day ; but the Volſei, and their confederates,. aot caring to engage a victorious army, de-</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
