The land on the coast of Nice and Liguria consists chiefly of narrow strips of valley, which in the greater portion is composed of sand, and not very appropriate for the growth of grain, though a little is grown in some of the more fertile of the valleys ; but the common people only eat bread on Sundays and holidays, and at other times subsist on chestnuts obtained from the Apennines, and on inferior cheese made by themselves. They derive a part of their subsistence from fish, especially sardinias, which at some seasons are abundant ; and oil, a useful accompaniment, is at a very moderate price.</p><p>The agriculture of the island of Sardinia differs so much from that of the rest of the kingdom, that it merits a special notice, the more so from its having been, in ancient times, the source of supplies of grain to the continent of Italy, and occasionally of Spain. The lands are divided into feudal and non-feudal. The former comprise those belonging to the respective nobles, as well as those sold to individuals, but recognising the feudal lord. Those not feudal belong to communities or to individuals ; for landed property can be let or sold, or given away, with the consent of the tribunals, or of the husband if belonging to married females. The first lands as to importance, though the least in extent, are those called <hi rend="italic">tanche,</hi> or enclosed lands, which are generally well cultivated. But the far larger proportion are those called <hi rend="italic">vidazzone,</hi> or belonging to communities. They are chiefly divided into three parts, each of which is cultivated in its turn, and, while under culture, is enclosed with a line of hurdles ; but the rest being fallow, lies open to the ravages of wandering flocks, and the blast of every wind that blows.</p><p>The foreign commerce of Sardinia, both by sea and by land, with the countries contiguous to it, naturally demands observation. The number and tonnage of the vessels belonging to the kingdom are shown in the following table, furnished by the British consul.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Vessels belonging to the Kingdom of Sardinia,</hi></p><table><row><cell>Year.</cell><cell>From one to thirty tons.</cell><cell>From thirty to sixty tons.</cell><cell>From sixty to a hundred tons.</cell><cell>Above a hundred tons.</cell><cell><p>Number of the</p><p>.

There are many smaller articles of luxury, whose aggregate amount bears hut a trifling proportion in value to those here enumerated. The commerce in grain is casual, depending in a great degree on the productiveness of the harvests in Switzerland, to which country, when the domestic supply is found to be insufficient, the corn, chiefly wheat from the ports of Odessa and Taganrog, is transmitted to the Swiss districts bordering on the Sardinian territory.</p><p><hi rend="italic">A Statement of the Number and Tonnage of Vessels, distinguishing the countries to which they belonged, which entered inwards and cleared outwards at the port of Genoa in the year</hi> 1834, <hi rend="italic">exclusive of Coasters.</hi></p><table><row><cell>Countries.</cell><cell cols="2">Inwards.</cell><cell cols="2">Outwards.</cell></row><row><cell/><cell>Ships.</cell><cell>Tons.</cell><cell>Ships.</cell><cell>Tons.</cell></row><row><cell>British	</cell><cell>96</cell><cell><p>15,014</p><p>121,000</p><p>3,800</p><p>1,390</p><p>695</p></cell><cell>95</cell><cell><p>14,973</p><p>117,000</p><p>5,398</p><p>1,673</p><p>695</p></cell></row><row><cell>Sardinian	</cell><cell>998</cell><cell/><cell>996</cell><cell/></row><row><cell>American	-	</cell><cell>18</cell><cell/><cell>25</cell><cell/></row><row><cell>Austrian		</cell><cell>8</cell><cell/><cell>8</cell><cell/></row><row><cell>Danish....	</cell><cell>4</cell><cell/><cell>4</cell><cell/></row><row><cell>Dutch			</cell><cell>11</cell><cell><p>1,400</p><p>19,000</p><p>83</p></cell><cell>15</cell><cell><p>1,836</p><p>18,597</p><p>83</p></cell></row><row><cell>French	</cell><cell>258</cell><cell/><cell>256</cell><cell/></row><row><cell>Greek	</cell><cell>1</cell><cell/><cell>1</cell><cell/></row><row><cell>Neapolitan	</cell><cell>149</cell><cell><p>19,100</p><p>420</p></cell><cell>151</cell><cell><p>19,334</p><p>1,077</p><p>6,491</p><p>2,918</p><p>4,882</p></cell></row><row><cell>Russian	</cell><cell>1</cell><cell/><cell>3</cell><cell/></row><row><cell>Spanish			</cell><cell>148</cell><cell><p>6,400</p><p>2,100</p><p>3,900</p></cell><cell>153</cell><cell/></row><row><cell>Swedish	</cell><cell>10</cell><cell/><cell>16</cell><cell/></row><row><cell>Tuscan, Roman,  and Lucchese...</cell><cell>160</cell><cell/><cell>179</cell><cell/></row><row><cell>Bremen and Lubeck.</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>610</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>733</cell></row><row><cell>Hanoverian	</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>167</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>278</cell></row><row><cell/><cell/><cell/><cell/><cell/></row></table><p>The variations in the years preceding and succeeding 1834 are so little as to render our filling the pages of this work with lengthened accounts quite unnecessary ; and the particular year selected is sufficient to show the general nature and extent of the trade, and the respective countries with which it is carried on.</p><p>The cities of this kingdom whose population amounts to more than 10,000 souls, are the following.</p><p>Turin	120,596	Chieri	14,000</p><p>Genoa	 94,000	Savona	13,400</p><p>Alessandria	 36,000	Carmagnola.	13,200</p><p>Cagliari	 29,000	Saluzzo	13,200</p><p>Nice	 27,000	Pinerola	12,500</p><p>Asti	 23,000	Boghera	12,147</p><p>Sassari	 21,000	Chamberi	12,060</p><p>Cuneo	 20,000	Bra	11,300</p><p>Savigliano	 19,000	St Remo	11,200</p><p>Casale	 18,000	Novi	11,100</p><p>Mondovi	 17,000	Racconigi	11,000</p><p>Novara	 16,400	Chiavari	10,800</p><p>Bercelli	 16,000	Rapello	10,150</p><p>Vigevano			15,000	Tortona	10,015</p><p>Fossano	 14,300</p><p>The most valuable product of Sardinia which is exported is silk, but it has little connection with maritime commerce. The greater part of it, which goes to other countries, is transported by land-carriage, in order to supply the manufacturers of France, of Prussia, of Belgium, of Holland, and in some measure of England ; for even to the latter country much is now sent by land through France, or by the Rhine. Oil is one of the greater productions exported from Genoa, after being collected there by means of the numerous coasting vessels with which the shores of Sardinia abound. The larger portion of this article is sent to England, where it is used by the wool-combers in the manufacture of cloth ; but a considerable quantity of it is sent to Holland, and from thence into the interior of Germany, where it is applied to the same purposes. Rice is also exported by sea to France, though it can scarcely sustain the competition with that which is produced in the East Indies or in Carolina. Though much wine is made, it is almost wholly consumed at home, the quantity exported being trifling. Fruit is an article of foreign trade; and soap, white lead, essences, and perfumery, may he enumerated as the most prominent of the smaller</p></body></text></TEI>
