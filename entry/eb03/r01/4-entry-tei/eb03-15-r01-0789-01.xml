(James), a late ingenious hiſtorical and political writer, was born, we know not when or where, being ſirſt known as a ſchoolmaſter in Philadelphia in North America. He came to England about the be-ginning of the reign of George I. and wrote ſome things in the dramatic way, which were not received with great applauſe ; but though he did not ſucceed as a poet, he was a very ingenious proſe-writer. He wrote A Hiſtory of England, commencing with the Stuarts, which is much eſteemed ; as were his political eſſays and pamphlets, ſome of which were looked upon as mafter-pιeces&gt; His laſt publication, The Caſe of Authors by Profeſſion, is an excellent and entertaining performance. He died in 1762.</p>
