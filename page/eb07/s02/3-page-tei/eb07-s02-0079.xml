And even in ecclesiastical promotions, where the freehold passes to the person promoted, corporal possession is required at this day to vest the property completely in the new proprietor, who, according to the distinction of the canonist, acquires the <hi rend="italic">jus ad rem,</hi> or inchoate and imperfect right, by nomination and institution, but not the <hi rend="italic">jus in re, or </hi>the complete and full right, unless by corporal possession. Therefore in dignities possession is given by instalment, and in rectories and vicarages by induction, without which no temporal rights accrue to the minister, though every ecclesiastical power is vested in him by institution. So also by our law, even in descents of lands, which are cast on the heir by act of the law itself, the heir has not <hi rend="italic">plenum dominium,</hi> or full and complete ownership, till he has made an actual corporal entry into the lands ; for if he dies before entry made, his heir shall not be entitled to take the possession, but the heir of the person who was last actually seised. It is not therefore a mere right to enter, but the actual entry, that makes a man complete owner, so as to transmit the inheritance to his own heirs : <hi rend="italic">Non jus, sed seisina, facit stipitem.</hi></p><p>Yet the corporal tradition of lands being sometimes inconvenient, a symbolical delivery of possession was in many cases anciently allowed, by transferring something near at hand, in the presence of credible witnesses, which by agreement should serve to represent the very thing designed to be conveyed ; and an occupancy of this sign or symbol was permitted as equivalent to an occupancy of the land itself. Among the Jews, we find the evidence of a purchase thus defined in the book of Ruth : “ Now this was the manner in former time in Israel, concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things ; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour, and this was a testimony in Israel.” Among the ancient Goths and Swedes, contracts for the sale of lands were made in the presence of witnesses, who extended the cloak of the buyer, while the seller cast a clod of the land into it, in order to give possession ; and a staff or wand was also delivered from the vender to the vendee, which passed through the hands of the witnesses. With our Saxon ancestors the delivery of a turf was a necessary solemnity in the conveyance of lands ; and, to this day, the conveyance of our copyhold estates is usually made from the seller to the lord or his steward by delivery of a rod or verge, and then from the lord to the purchaser by redelivery of the same in the presence of a jury of tenants.</p><p>Conveyances in writing were the last and most refined improvement. The mere delivery of possession, either actual or symbolical, depending upon the ocular testimony and remembrance of the witnesses, was liable to be forgotten or misrepresented, and became frequently incapable of proof. Besides, the new occasions and necessities introduced by the advancement of commerce required means to be devised of charging and encumbering estates, and of making them liable to a multitude of conditions and minute designations, for the purposes of raising money, without an absolute sale of the land ; and sometimes similar proceedings were found useful in order to make a decent and competent provision for the numerous branches of a family, and for other domestic views ; none of which could be effected by a mere simple corporal transfer of the soil from one man to another, which was principally calculated for conveying an absolute and unlimited dominion. Written deeds were therefore introduced, in order to specify and perpetuate the peculiar purposes of the party who conveyed- Yet still for a very long series of years, they were</p><p>never made use of, but in company with the more ancient and notorious method of transfer by delivery of corporal possession.</p><p>SEISTAN, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Segestan,</hi> an extensive country or province, formerly called Nimrose, situated to the east of Persia, between Candahar and Khorassan. It is bounded on the north and north-west by Khorassan, on the east by Candahar, and on the south and south-west by Mekran and Kerman. This country, although now reduced to a deplorable condition, once rivalled in prosperity the most flourishing provinces of the empire. It was the country of Jamsheed and Rustum, the heroes of the Shah Nameh, and of Jacob Ben Leth, the conqueror of the caliph of Bagdad. The greater part of the country is flat, sandy, and uninhabited. This is partly occasioned by the wind, which blows during the hot months with such violence as to overwhelm with clouds of sand, houses, gardens, and fields. Captain Christie, who passed through the heart of Seistan in 1810, in his route from Kelat, in Beloochistan, to Herat, says, that from Nooβhky to the banks of the Heer- mund, the country through which he travelled was little better than a desert, intersected by sand-hills. But he travelled at no time twenty-five miles without meeting water. He did not see a single town, or even a village, in the way ; and the only inhabitants of this solitary wild that he saw were a few Belooche and Patan shepherds, who lived in tents pitched in the vicinity of the springs. The country through which he passed was covered with an astonishing number of ruined towns, villages, and forts, and at one of these, Kulcauput, was a noble palace, in a tolerable state of preservation ; also the ruined remains of a city, which he describes as of great extent. He also met with the ruins of another large city ; and a few miles beyond it, the remains of a third. Everywhere he thus saw the traces of ruin and desolation, the fatal consequences of commotion and war. The only remnants of fertility that he met with were near the banks of the noble river Heermund, the ancient Etymander, which flows through the centre of the country, from the mountains of Huzara, beyond Caubul, to the Lake of Zerreh, which is said to be thirty furlongs in length and six in breadth. This river flows through a valley varying in breadth from one to two miles, the desert on one side rising in perpendicular cliffs ; the valley, watered by the river, is covered with verdure and brushwood. The capital of the country is Dooshak, where the prince of Seistan resides. It is about eight or nine miles from the Heermund or Helmund. The modern city is small and compact, but the ruins cover a vast extent of ground. It is populous, has a good bazaar, and the inhabitants, who are dressed in the Persian manner, had a more civilized appearance than the other natives of Seistan, who are either Patan or Belooche shepherds, that lead a wandering life, and pitch their tents amidst the ruins of ancient palaces. The country in the vicinity of the capital is open, well cultivated, and produces wheat and barley in sufficient quantities to be exported to Herat. The pasturage is also good and abundant. Colonel Kinneir supposes Dooshak to be no other than the Zaranga of Ptolemy, and that the old name has been lost in the constant revolutions to which the country has been exposed for more than a century, and to which its present desolate state may in a great measure be attributed. Between this city and Ferrah, Captain Christie, to whom we owe the knowledge that we possess of this region, found the country in general desert, except in the immediate neighbourhood of the towns and villages through which he passed. Seistan is at present divided into a number of small independent states, governed by chiefs, who live in fortified villages, situatcd principally on the banks of the Heermund. The country to the west of this river consists of an arid waste, intersected by one or two ranges</p><p>of mountains, in the midst of which, about ten days’ journey</p></body></text></TEI>
