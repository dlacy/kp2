<p><span class="font0">sequence of operations is very similar to that described for the simple hand-wheel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Machine or Factory Rope-Making.—</span><span class="font0">The most modern methods of rope-making are far superior to the foregoing, which, as&nbsp;stated, have been introduced to show the principle. One of the&nbsp;greatest drawbacks in the formation of a strand from a haul or&nbsp;chain, even for a small number of yarns, is the irregularity&nbsp;of the tension of the yarns at different parts of the strand.&nbsp;If a large number of yarns be required for each strand, it would&nbsp;be almost impossible to make a satisfactory rope by the above&nbsp;system. If, however, the strand be made from bobbins, each&nbsp;yarn bears its proper share of the tension, and an almost perfect&nbsp;rope is obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Two mechanical methods are in use for the spinning of long vegetable fibres—the ordinary and the special. When flax or&nbsp;jute yarns are required, they are almost invariably spun on&nbsp;the ordinary spinning frames, and the yarn rewound from the&nbsp;spinning bobbins on warping bobbins, or else rewound in the&nbsp;shape of rolls or cheeses. Hemp yarns, especially the finer&nbsp;kinds, are sometimes treated in the same manner, but Manila&nbsp;hemp, New Zealand hemp </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Phormium),</span><span class="font0"> and similar fibres,&nbsp;are invariably spun on bobbins by special machinery. The&nbsp;strands for light ropes may then be made on the twisting frames,&nbsp;and the rope finished on what is called a “ house machine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• When a large rope is desired, a slightly different method is usually employed. The bobbins from the automatic spinner,&nbsp;or the rolls from the winding frame, are placed upon pegs in&nbsp;a frame which answers the same purpose as a bank or creel used&nbsp;in conjunction with a warping machine. If the rope is to be&nbsp;say 31 in. in ^circumference, there may be, with fine yams,&nbsp;300 or more individual threads in its composition. Suppose&nbsp;that 300 threads are to be used, then 300 bobbins would be&nbsp;placed on the pegs of the bobbin bank or creel, and divided&nbsp;into three sets of 100* threads each for . a three-strand rope.&nbsp;The threads are passed separately through a register* plate,&nbsp;which is simply a plate containing a sufficient number of holes&nbsp;for the maximum quantity required, and arranged in a series&nbsp;of concentric circles. There are. three sets of concentric rings&nbsp;used in the plate for a three-strand rope, and four sets for one of&nbsp;four strands. As the threads emerge from the register plate&nbsp;they are grouped together and passed through a tapered tube,&nbsp;the sectional area of the smaller end of the tube being equal to&nbsp;the sectional area of the strand. This operation is done for&nbsp;each group of 100 threads, and finally the three or four groups&nbsp;arc attached to separate rotating hooks of the forming machine&nbsp;or “ traveller.” As the latter moves down the walk on rails, it</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">draws the threads from the bobbins in the bank, and through</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the register plate and tubes, while the hooks put in the twist. A perfectly circular strand, without slack threads, is thus&nbsp;formed; and, at the same time, a uniform strand is obtained,&nbsp;since the ratio of the speed of the traveller to the number of&nbsp;turns per inch of the hooks is constant. The process is continued until the desired length of strand is made—about 150&nbsp;fathoms (300 yds.) of each of the three strands are required&nbsp;for 100 to 120 fathoms of rope—then a little more twist is&nbsp;introduced. Afterwards, all three strands are placed on one&nbsp;hook of the traveller, and the ends from the shaping tubes&nbsp;are cut off and put on the hooks of the fixed machine, called&nbsp;the “ fore-turn.” The carriage containing the “ top ” is now&nbsp;brought close to the traveller, and the strands are placed in the&nbsp;grooves of the top as explained under hand-laying. Similar&nbsp;means to those used in hand-spinning are adopted for keeping&nbsp;the rope off the ground. The two machines are now started,&nbsp;the three hooks of the fore-turn machine revolving in one direction and the single hook of the traveller revolving in the opposite&nbsp;direction. Simultaneously the carriage with the laying top&nbsp;moves forward towards the head of the walk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fig- 9» Plate I., shows many stages in the process of rope-making. The most prominent part shows the carriage with the top in position&nbsp;approaching the fore-turn machine at the head of the walk. The&nbsp;person on the right of the carriage is holding a top in his left hand,&nbsp;while the top in the carriage is laying a rope of four strands. At&nbsp;other parts of the figure appear three or four travellers, some twisting the strands, others moving up the walk as the laying proceeds,&nbsp;while on the extreme right one machine is laying two ropes, of three&nbsp;strands each, at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have already stated that the yarns for the above machine may be prepared by two systems. When the hemp fibte is spun on the&nbsp;ordinary frame, the method of preparation for such a frame is somewhat similar to that employed for flax,, but since the fibre is harsher&nbsp;than flax, it invariably requires softening. The softening machines&nbsp;crush the streaks as m the case of jute, but the fluted rollers are&nbsp;arranged to form part of a circle. The coarser fibres receive a&nbsp;somewhat different treatment; the first process in the preparation&nbsp;of Manila hemp and similar fibres used for rope yarn is illustrated in&nbsp;fig. io, Plate I. The streaks are clearly shown as being led between&nbsp;fluted rollers on to the pins of the hackling and spreading machine;&nbsp;the lanterns or skeleton rollers,, seen on the extreme right, press the&nbsp;fibres into the pins. A little oil is made to drop on t cut he fibre in&nbsp;order to soften it and to facilitate the operation. The oiling apparatus is usually of a simple character, and consists of a revolving&nbsp;roller partly immersed in an oil bath. The roller is driven as shown&nbsp;in the figure, and the oil which it draws up is scraped off its surface&nbsp;by a knife-edge, and led, by means of a sheet, upon the fibre between&nbsp;the fluted rollers and the gill-pins. A view of a similar machine is&nbsp;shown in fig. 11, Plate II., from which it will be seen that there are&nbsp;two sheets of revolving gill-pins. The sheet nearest the feed-cloth&nbsp;revolves slightly quicker than the surface speed of the fluted feed&nbsp;rollers, while the second sheet moves at a much higher rate. The&nbsp;difference in the speeds of the gill-pins results in the fibre being&nbsp;combed out and straightened, while the delivery rollers, the surface&nbsp;speed of which is slightly greater than that of the second sheet of&nbsp;gill-pins, help further to complete the process, and finally deliver the&nbsp;fibre in the form of a broad ribbon, termed a sliver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In general, three such machines are used for the process; the pins in the gill-sheets are graded, those in the second machine being finer&nbsp;and more closely set than those in the first machine, while a still&nbsp;finer and closer arrangement obtains in the third machine. The&nbsp;slivers from the third hackling and spreading machine are now placed&nbsp;at the back of the first drawing frame, one type of which appears in&nbsp;fig. 12, Plate II. Each sliver is passed separately over a guide pulley,&nbsp;led upon the pins, drawn out and joined by others, and finally&nbsp;delivered as a sliver ready for the second drawing frame. A similar&nbsp;process is carried on in this machine, from which the sliver emerges&nbsp;ready for the spinning frame. It will thus be seen that a system of&nbsp;doubling, as well as of drawing, obtains in these processes as in flax-preparing; such a system is adopted in order to obtain uniformity&nbsp;of sliver and the correct weight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The slivers are taken from the drawing frame to the automatic spinner—a beautiful piece of mechanism. Fig. 13, Plate II.,&nbsp;illustrates the machine as it leaves the makers. Two sliver cans&nbsp;from the second drawing frame are placed behind the machine, and&nbsp;the slivers passed between the rollers. They are then deflected&nbsp;and made to enter a trumpet-mouthed conductor which guides&nbsp;them on to the pins of the chain-sheet. As the two slivers emerge&nbsp;from these pins, each enters a separate self-feeding and adjusting&nbsp;apparatus, the function of which is, as its name implies, to regulate&nbsp;the delivery of the sliver to the nippers.. The delivery is increased&nbsp;or decreased according as the sliver is. thin.or thick. Consequently,&nbsp;a very even yarn results; indeed, it is claimed that for uniformity&nbsp;of yarn this system of spinning has no equal. The bobbins, which</span></p>
