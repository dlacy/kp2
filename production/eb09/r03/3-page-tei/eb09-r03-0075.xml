                                                  Catiline, was mainly the work of the Italian
                                                  middle class, already rendered uneasy both by the
                                                  rumours which were rife of revolutionary schemes
                                                  and of Cæsar’s boundless ambition, and by
                                                  the numerous disquieting signs of disturbance
                                                  noticeable in Italy. The new consul vigorously set
                                                  himself to discharge the trust placed in him. He
                                                  defeated the insidious proposals of Rullus for
                                                  Cæsar’s aggrandizement, and assisted in quashing
                                                  the prosecution of Rabirius. But with the consular
                                                  elections in the autumn of 63 a fresh danger arose

                                                  unselfish attempt at reform ; L. Sergius Catilina
                                                  himself was a patrician, who had held high office,
                                                  and possessed considerable ability and courage ;
                                                  but he was bankrupt in character and in purse, and
                                                  two successive defeats in the consular elections
                                                  had rendered him desperate. To retrieve his broken
                                                  fortunes by violence was a course which was only
