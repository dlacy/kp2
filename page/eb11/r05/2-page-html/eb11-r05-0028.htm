<p><span class="font0">end. Eton rowing, on the other hand, has continued to prosper, and for many years it has been the greatest “ nursery ” of first-class oarsmen. Since 1861 the Eton College Boat Club has&nbsp;never failed to enter a crew at Henley Regatta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At Oxford the records of periodical races between college boats begin as early as 1815, and those of Cambridge a few&nbsp;years later. The first contest between eight-oared crews&nbsp;representing the two universities took place at Henley-on-Thames in June 1829. The second contest was not until 1836,&nbsp;and was rowed from Westminster to Putney. In 1837 and&nbsp;1838 the universities were unable to make a match, and in&nbsp;each of those years a race was rowed between Cambridge and&nbsp;the Leander Club, which had thus early become the premier&nbsp;club of the tideway. It was not always easy in the early days&nbsp;of boat-racing for the university boat clubs to agree as to the&nbsp;conditions and time of the match, but on several] occasions&nbsp;when the universities had been unable to meet on the tideway they fought their battle whilst competing for the Grand&nbsp;Challenge Cup at Henley Regatta. Since 1856 the Oxford and&nbsp;Cambridge boat race has been an annual event. It is rowed&nbsp;about a week or ten days before Easter from Putney to Mortlake&nbsp;over what is known as the championship course, a distance&nbsp;of 4} m. The race is rowed with the flood-tide, and occupies as a rule a time varying between 19 and 22 min. The&nbsp;time occupied by a crew in covering this course depends a&nbsp;great deal more upon the conditions of wind and tide than&nbsp;upon the excellence, or the reverse, of the crew. The crew&nbsp;of each university is selected by a president, usually one of the&nbsp;senior members of the last crew, who is elected at the first&nbsp;meeting in the summer term and holds office for a year. Thus&nbsp;the university race comes at the end of his term of office, and&nbsp;he has every opportunity during the summer and autumn of&nbsp;studying the material which will be at his disposal for the formation of a crew in the ensuing spring. The aquatic arrangements&nbsp;at the two universities are very much alike. The university&nbsp;year begins in October. During the winter term the freshmen&nbsp;are instructed in the elements of rowing, while the senior men&nbsp;are engaged in practising for the University (inter-collegiate)&nbsp;Fours, a race which takes place early in November. During&nbsp;the latter portion of the term the president of the University&nbsp;Boat Club is engaged in selecting and coaching the trial eights,&nbsp;two picked crews comprising the bulk of the material available&nbsp;for the formation of the university crew. The trial eight races&nbsp;are rowed in the beginning of December, that of Cambridge&nbsp;on the Ouse at Ely, and that of Oxford on the Thames at&nbsp;Moulsford, neither the Cam nor the Isis being wide enough&nbsp;for two crews to race abreast. During the whole of the Easter&nbsp;term the university crews are engaged in practice and training&nbsp;for the University Boat Race. The attention of the remainder&nbsp;of the rowing men at the universities is devoted to training for&nbsp;the bumping races known at Oxford and Cambridge respectively&nbsp;as the Torpids and Lent Races. Each college is represented in&nbsp;these races, and no oarsman who has rowed in the first boat of&nbsp;his college during the previous summer is qualified to compete.&nbsp;The boats start at fixed distances apart, and each boat endeavours&nbsp;to bump the boat in front of it, and to avoid being bumped&nbsp;by the boat behind. When a bump is effected, the two boats&nbsp;involved draw to the side, and the next night the successful&nbsp;boat starts in front of its victim. Each spring the boats start&nbsp;in the order in which they finished the previous year. The&nbsp;races last for six nights at Oxford and four at Cambridge. In&nbsp;the summer term the important bumping races between the&nbsp;best crews of each college take place. They are known as&nbsp;“ The Eights ” at Oxford and “ The May Races ” at Cambridge.&nbsp;To attain the position of “ Head of the River ” in these races&nbsp;is the summit of a college boat club’s ambition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The great arena of rowing contests is Henley Royal Regatta. It was founded in 1839 <sup>at a</sup> public meeting held in the town&nbsp;hall at Henley-on-Thames, at which it was decided to raise a&nbsp;subscription and purchase two challenge cups, the Grand&nbsp;Challenge Cup to be rowed for annually in eight-oared boats&nbsp;open to all amateur crews, and the Town Challenge Cup for&nbsp;four-oared crews residing within 5 m. of Henley. The first&nbsp;regatta was held on the 14th of June 1839, and was a most&nbsp;successful affair, the Grand Challenge Cup being won by the&nbsp;Trinity Boat Club, Cambridge. In 1840 another district race&nbsp;was added, and in 1841 the Stewards Challenge Cup for four oars&nbsp;was added to the programme, open to competition upon the&nbsp;same conditions as the Grand Challenge Cup. There have now&nbsp;for many years been eight events at the regatta, four of which&nbsp;are open to all amateurs, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">viz.</span><span class="font0"> the Grand Challenge Cup for&nbsp;eight oars, the Stewards Challenge Cup for fours, the Silver&nbsp;Goblets for pair oars founded in 184$, and the Diamond Sculls&nbsp;for single scullers founded in 1844. The races for which the&nbsp;entry is restricted are the Ladies Challenge Plate for eight oars&nbsp;(founded 1845) and the Visitors Challenge Cup for four oars&nbsp;(founded 1847), which are open to crews from schools and&nbsp;colleges in the United Kingdom; also the Thames Challenge&nbsp;Cup for eight oars (founded 1868) and Wyfold Challenge Cup&nbsp;for four oars (founded 1855). The rule as to entry for the&nbsp;Thames Cup is that no one who has won the Grand Challenge&nbsp;or Stewards Cup may compete, nor may any one enter for this&nbsp;race and for the Grand or Stewards Cups in the same year.&nbsp;The rule for the Wyfold Cup is the same, except that a competitor may also enter for the Grand Challenge Cup.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The original regatta course was from the upper end of the Temple Island to Henley Bridge, but a change was made in&nbsp;1886 so as to avoid the corner at the finish. The races now&nbsp;start at the lower end of the island and finish at the upper end&nbsp;of the grounds of Phyllis Court. The course is 1 m. 550 yds.&nbsp;in length and about no ft. in width. The races are rowed&nbsp;against the stream, and the time usually occupied by the&nbsp;winning crew of the Grand Challenge Cup is within a few&nbsp;seconds of 7 min. In 1843 took place the famous “ seven-oar ” victory of Oxford. At the eleventh hour one of the&nbsp;Oxford crew was incapacitated by illness. Their opponents,&nbsp;the Cambridge Subscription Rooms Club, refused to allow them&nbsp;to introduce a substitute, and the Oxford men gained undying&nbsp;fame by winning the Grand Challenge Cup with seven oars.&nbsp;Ten years later (1853) there was a magnificent race between&nbsp;Oxford and Cambridge in the Grand Challenge Cup, the former&nbsp;winning by 18 in. only. In 1862 there was a dead heat in&nbsp;the final heat of the Diamond Sculls between Mr E. D. Brick-wood and Mr W. B. Woodgate. In 1878 occurred the memorable&nbsp;contest between Mr T. C. Edwards-Moss and Mr G. W. Lee&nbsp;(U.S.A.) in a heat for the Diamond Sculls which was won on the&nbsp;post by the former. In 1891 the Leander Club, after a dead&nbsp;heat with the Thames R.C., began a series of victories in the&nbsp;Grand Challenge Cup, winning the cup on seven occasions in&nbsp;the next ten years. In 1892 the Diamond Sculls left England&nbsp;for the first time, having been won by Mr J. J. K. Ooms of&nbsp;Hofland. In 1895 a crew representing Cornell University,&nbsp;U.S.A., entered for the Grand Challenge Cup and were drawn&nbsp;in their heat against the Leander Club. Owing to a misunderstanding between the starter and the Leander crew,'the latter&nbsp;failed to start, and the Cornell crew rowed on to the finish&nbsp;without offering to return to the start, a proceeding which&nbsp;caused no little comment at the time. On the following day&nbsp;they were defeated by Trinity Hall, Cambridge, the ultimate&nbsp;winners. In 1897 the Grand Challenge Cup was won by 2 ft.&nbsp;by New College, Oxford, in the record time of 6 min. 51 secs.,&nbsp;after a desperate race with Leander. The feature of the next&nbsp;ten years was the persistency with which colonial and foreign&nbsp;crews endeavoured to carry off the principal prizes of the regatta, and the invasion culminated in 1906 by the capture of&nbsp;the Grand Challenge Cup by a crew from the Club Nautique&nbsp;de Gand, Belgium. On this occasion the Leander Club was&nbsp;not represented, but in 1907 the Belgians repeated their victory&nbsp;after defeating a strong Leander crew in one of the heats. In&nbsp;1903 Mr Herbert Steward, the chairman of the regatta committee, published a detailed record of the regatta from its&nbsp;commencement, which gives a complete history of the meeting&nbsp;and an account of every race.</span></p>
