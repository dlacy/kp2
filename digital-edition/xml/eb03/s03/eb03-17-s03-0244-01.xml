 in botany: A genus of the pentagynia order, belonging to the decandria claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 13th order, <hi rend="italic">Succulenta.</hi> The calyx is quinqueſid; the corolla is pentapetalous, pointed, and ſpreading; there are five nectariferous ſquamæ or ſcales at the baſe of the germen. The capſules are five.</p><p>The ſpecies are 20 in number. 1. The Verticillatum; 2. Telephium; 3. Anacampſeros; 4. Aizoon; 5. Hybridum; 6. Populifolium; 7. Stellatum; 8. Cepaea; 9. Libanoticum; 10. Daſyphyllum; 11. Reflexum; 12. Rupeſtre; <hi rend="italic">1 3.</hi> Lineare; 14. Hiſpanicum; 15. Album; 16. Acre; 17. Sexangulare; 18. Annuum; 19. Villoſum; 20. Atratum. The following ſpecies are the moſt remarkable.</p><p>1. The telephium, common orpine, or live-long, hath a perennial root, compoſed of many knobbed tubercles, ſending up erect, round, ſucculent ſtalks, branching half a yard or two feet high, garniſhed with oblong, plane, ſerrated, ſucculent leaves, and the ſtalks terminated by a leafy corymbus of flowers, of different colours in the varieties. This ſpecies is an inhabitant of woods and dry places in England, &amp;c. but has been long a reſident of gardens for variety and medical uſe. 2. The anacampſeros, or decumbent evergreen Italian orpine, hath a fibrous perennial root, decumbenti or trailing ſtalks, wedge-ſhaped entire leaves, and the ſtalks terminated by a corymbus of purple flowers. 3. The rupeſtre, rock ſedum, or ſtone-crop of St Vincent’s rock, hath ſlender, trailing, purple ſtalks; ſhort, thick, awl- ſhaped, ſucculent, glaucous leaves in clutters, quinqueſariouſly imbricated round the ſtalks, and the ſtalks terminated by roundiſh cymoſe bunches of bright yellow flowers. It grows naturally on St Vincent’s rock near Briſtol, and other rocky places in Europe. 4. The aizoon, or Siberian yellow orpine, hath a tuberculate, fibrous, perennial root; many upright, round, ſucculent, ſtalks, a foot high; lanceolated, plane, ſerrated, thickiſh leaves; and the ſtalks terminated by a cloſe-fitting cymoſe cluſter of bright yellow flowers. 5. The reflexum, reflexed ſmall yellow ſedum, or prick-madam, hath a ſlender fibrous perennial root; ſmall trailing ſucculent ſtalks, garniſhed with thick, awl-ſhaped, ſucculent leaves ſparſedly, the lower ones recurved, and the ſtalks terminated by reflexed spikes of bright yellow flowers. It grows naturally on old walls and buildings in England, &amp;c. 6. The acre, acrid ſedum, common ſtone-crop of the wall, or wall-pepper, hath ſmall ſibry roots, very ſlender ſucculent ſtalks four or five inches high, very ſmall, ſuboval, gibbous, erect, alternate leaves, cloſe together, and the ſtalks terminated by trifid cymoſe bunches of ſmall yellow flowers. This fort grows abundantly on rocks, old walls, and tops of buildings, almoſt everywhere, which often appear covered with the flowers in ſummer. 7. The ſexangulare, or ſexangular ſtone-crop, hath a fibry perennial root; thick, ſhort, ſucculent ſtalks; ſmall, ſuboval, gibbous, erect leaves cloſe together, arranged fix ways imbricatim, and the ſtalks terminated by bunches of yellow flowers. It grows on rocky and other dry places in England, &amp;c <hi rend="italic">.</hi> 8. The album, or white ſtone-crop, hath ſibry perennial roots; trailing ſlender ſtalks, ſix or eight inches long; oblong, obtuſe, ſeſſile, ſpreading leaves; and the ſtalks terminated by branchy cymoſe bunches of white flowers. This grows on old walls, rocks, and buildings, in England, &amp;c. 9. The hiſpanicum, or Spaniſh ſedum, hath</p><p>fibrous perennial roots, crowned with cluſters of taper, acute, ſucculent leaves; ſlender ſucculent ſtalks, four or five inches high, garniſhed alſo with taper leaves, and terminated by downy cymoſe cluſters of white flowers.</p><p>All theſe ſpecies of ſedum are hardy herbaceous ſucculent perennials, durable in root, but moſtly annual in ſtalk, &amp;c. which, riling in ſpring, flower in June, July, and Auguſt, in different ſorts; the flowers confiſting univerſally of five ſpreading petals, generally crowning the ſtalks numerouſly in corymboſe and cymoſe bunches and ſpikes, appearing tolerably conſpicuous, and are<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0251.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0245"/>
ſuceeeded by plenty of ſeeds in autumn, by which they may be propagated, alſo abundantly by parting the roots, and by ſhips or cuttings of the ſtalks in ſummer; in all of which methods they readily grow and ſpread very fall into tuſted bunches: being all of ſucculent growth, they conſequently delight moſt in dry foils, or in any dry rubbiſhy earth.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Uſes.</hi> As flowering plants, they are moſtly employed to embelliſh rock-work, ruins, and the like places, planting either the roots or cuttings of the ſhoots in a little mud or any moiſt ſoil at firſt, placing it in the crevices, where they will soon root and fix themſelves, and ſpread about very agreeably. For economical purpoſes, the reflexum and rupeſtre are cultivated in Holland and Germany, to mix with lettuce in ſallads, The wall-pepper is ſo acrid, that it bliſters the ſkin when applied externally. Taken inwardly, it excites vomiting. In ſcorbutic caſes and quartan agues, it is ſaid to be an excellent medicine under proper management. Goats eat it; cows, horſes, ſheep, and ſwine, refuſe it.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
