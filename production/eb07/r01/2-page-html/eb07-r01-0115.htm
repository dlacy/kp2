<p><span class="font1">glide without impediment over land and sea. The operations of the Tract Society are one of the wonders of our times. Their little works are showered down upon every&nbsp;shore, if not quite as eloquent as the words of Ulysses, yet,&nbsp;like his, they fall thick as the winter snows, and no barrier&nbsp;has yet been found that can effectually repress the effect&nbsp;of these missiles. There is no tongue or speech in which&nbsp;their voices are not heard, nor does there seem any limit to&nbsp;their operations, except that which circumscribes all human&nbsp;endeavours, the “ alte terminus hærens,” the limitation of&nbsp;funds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another great instrument for diffusing civilization and Christianity, is the spread of the English tongue. It is to&nbsp;be regretted that many natives are more anxious to Iearn&nbsp;English than the missionaries are to teach them, from the&nbsp;fear, it appears, by some missionary accounts, that these natives, when instructed, would only employ their knowledge&nbsp;of English in the pursuit of gain. It might probably so&nbsp;happen in several instances at first ; but the demand for&nbsp;those who have a superficial acquaintance with English is&nbsp;not unlimited, the market would soon be supplied, and the&nbsp;premium lowered. Then the advantages of teaching English&nbsp;would remain when the disadvantages were removed. The&nbsp;Romans understood the art of governing rather better than&nbsp;the English, and met the desire of the provincials to be instructed in the Roman tongue. With them it might be&nbsp;matter of amusement, not of scorn or rejection, that even&nbsp;remote barbarians had some aspirations after Italian refinement or Grecian eloquence :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">De conducendo rhetore jam loquitur Thule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Still remoter regions from Rome than the farthest Thule are now desirous of an acquaintance with English, and, if&nbsp;the English were wise, would be encouraged in this attainment, for with the spread of their language they would extend their glory and their commerce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The true end of missionary societies, it must never be lost sight of, is to raise up native teachers and preachers.&nbsp;Until this point be gained, the foreign missionaries must&nbsp;address the natives “ with stammering lips, and another&nbsp;tongue ;” for though the words may be native, the idiom&nbsp;is sure to be foreign ; and the missionaries will certainly&nbsp;continue to think in English, even when they are pronouncing the words of another language. This plain and&nbsp;obvious truth does not seem to have hitherto been sufficiently considered. Yet to perceive the difficulty, we have&nbsp;only to imagine a number of French apostles endeavouring,&nbsp;in broken English, to recall a heathen multitude of Britons&nbsp;to a sense of Solemnitjq and trying to infuse into their&nbsp;minds, through so distorting a medium, some knowledge of&nbsp;the truths of the Gospel. The actual engagement of a&nbsp;certain number of native teachers may serve indeed as an&nbsp;excuse, but not as a complete justification, for this important and obvious principle not having been carried more&nbsp;fully into effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The employment of well-educated native preachers supposes, in some degree, the erection of higher schools and colleges, and therefore presents the difficulty of finding&nbsp;sufficient funds and suitable teachers. But the employment of native teachers is itself a source of economy, tending to diminish the number, and of course the expenditure,&nbsp;of European labourers, whilst it would increase the efficiency of those who are actually sent. And the knowledge&nbsp;to be taught must in the first place be elementary, and&nbsp;suitable teachers for the elements might readily be found.&nbsp;The Kirk of Scotland affords a good example of scholastic&nbsp;instruction ; the Church of England possesses a college on&nbsp;a large and liberal scale ; and the plan of Serampore was&nbsp;marked by great ingenuity and intelligence. What is desirable is, that these beginnings should be pursued and extended; and that other denominations should make equal</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">efforts for training up a body of native missionaries, pos- <sup>τ </sup>sessed of the acquirements of Europe, and having greater&nbsp;opportunities than Europeans can possibly obtain, of familiar intercourse and ready sympathy amongst their own countrymen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But if missionary societies do not raise up native teachers in abundance, without any one’s instruction or assistance&nbsp;native heretics will rise up of themselves. Light and darkness are intermingling together, and new and foreign opinions, from casual intercourse with Europeans, will combine with old prejudices, and produce a new set of errors.&nbsp;Thus Gnosticism arose from the first dawn of Christianity&nbsp;in the East ; and thus Manes united the Persian doctrine&nbsp;with the true principles and the purer tenets of Revelation.&nbsp;Thus the Sikhs in India have remodelled the opinions of&nbsp;the Hindus, in part, upon the more warlike creed of their&nbsp;Moslem conquerors, and have adopted the half of the Moslem religion, which consists of the Koran and the sword,&nbsp;rejecting the Koran, but worshipping the “ All-Steel.” The&nbsp;overflow of the English race from either side of the Atlantic would augment the confusion and destruction of the&nbsp;ancient systems, alike by their profligacy or their piety;&nbsp;even the outcasts, throwing contempt upon the idols, prepare the way for the reception of a new system of belief ;&nbsp;for in many instances the native savages only wait for an&nbsp;example of their idols being despised with impunity, to&nbsp;cast them aside, and admit the superiority of that Power&nbsp;which has instructed the white strangers in so many arts&nbsp;of which they themselves are ignorant. The enterprise and&nbsp;rivalry of Europeans naturally tend to embroil the most&nbsp;distant nations in their quarrels, and shake the thrones of&nbsp;the native princes, already crumbling from their antiquity.&nbsp;Every new invention shortens the period which will make&nbsp;the whole world European ; and, considering onlj' human&nbsp;means, steam alone has brought us a hundred years nearer&nbsp;to the conversion of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The advantages of missions are obvious, both to those who send missionaries and to those who receive them. The&nbsp;contributors to missions have the double advantage both&nbsp;of saving and of giving. Every step of progress that the&nbsp;world has made firom the lowest scale of barbarism, is by&nbsp;saving ; by preferring the future to the present ; by making&nbsp;the acquisitions of the day </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font1"> farther than the day itself;&nbsp;and by rendering the surplus of the gain of the former generation a bequest to the generation which is to succeed it.&nbsp;But this noble attainment often proceeds from an unworthy cause. The love of money often injures the individual&nbsp;as much as it benefits his species. In giving to missionary&nbsp;societies, the saving is not only profitable, but the motive is&nbsp;generous and ennobling. It solves the question of Who is&nbsp;our neighbour, in the manner pointed out by the Saviour,&nbsp;and brings into a nearness of affection those who are distant in place. It restores the dormant affinity of our common species, and embraces the whole family of man in a&nbsp;new and still more elevated brotherhood. Some objects&nbsp;chiefly warm the affections, and others enlighten the understanding ; but the cause of missions at once accomplishes&nbsp;both. The labourer who, from his hard earnings, spares a&nbsp;portion for the greater spiritual need of that distant brother&nbsp;whom he never saw, not only feels his heart warmed towards him whom he intends to benefit, but listens with an&nbsp;interest, unfelt before, to all the information he may receive concerning him. Curiosity becomes a loftier feeling,&nbsp;which exists after novelty is ended ; and the head and the&nbsp;heart are alike actively employed in devising means to&nbsp;ameliorate the most distant tribes of the family of man, and&nbsp;in affording the resources which are to carry these plans&nbsp;into execution. If missionary efforts were attended with&nbsp;no other advantages, the benefits they confer upon the contributors were well w<sup>,</sup>orth all the sums that have been expended upon them. But they are “ twice blessed.” Every</span></p>
