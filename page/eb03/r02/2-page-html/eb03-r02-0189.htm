<p><span class="font0">which gave him the greateſt uneaſinefe, and which was puniſhed with the moſt unrelenting ſeverity, was that&nbsp;of Camillus, his lieutenant-general in Dalmatia. This&nbsp;general, incited by many of the principal men of Rome,&nbsp;openly rebelled againſt him, and aſſumed the title of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">emperor.</span><span class="font0"> Nothing could exceed the terrors of Claudius, upon being informed of this revolt : his nature&nbsp;and his crimes had diſpoſed him to be more cowardly&nbsp;than the reſt of mankind ; ſo that when Camillus commanded him by letters to relinquiſh the empire, and&nbsp;retire to a private ſtation, he ſeemed inclined to obey.&nbsp;However, his fears upon this occaſion were ſoon removed : for the legions which had declared for Camillus&nbsp;being terrified by ſome prodigies, ſhortly after abandoned him ; ſo that the man whom but five days before they bad acknowledged as emperor, they now&nbsp;thought it no infamy to deſtroy. The cruelty of&nbsp;Meſſalina and her minions upon this occaſion ſeemed to&nbsp;have no bounds. They ſo wrought upon the emperor’s&nbsp;fears and ſuſpicions, that numbers were executed without trial or proof; and ſcarce any, even of thoſe who&nbsp;were but ſuſpected, eſeaped, unleſs by ranſoming their&nbsp;lives with their fortunes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By ſuch cruelfie9 as theſe, the favourites of the emperor endeavoured to eſtabliſh his and their own authority : but in order to increaſe the neceſſity of their aſſiſtance, they laboured to augment the greatneſs of his terrors. He now became a prey to jealouſy and diſ-quietude. Being one day in the temple, and finding&nbsp;a ſword that was left there by accident, he convened&nbsp;the ſenate in a fright, and informed them of his danger. After this he never ventured to go to any feaſt&nbsp;without being ſurrounded by his guards, nor would he&nbsp;ſuffer any man to approach him without a previous&nbsp;ſearch. Thus wholly employed by hist anxiety for ſelf-preſervation, he entirely left the care of the ſtate to his&nbsp;favourites, who by degrees gave him a reliſh ſor daughter. From this time he ſeemed delighted with inflicting tortures ; and on a certain occaſion continued&nbsp;ä whole day at the city Tibur, waiting for an hangman from Rome, that he might feaſt his eyes with an&nbsp;execution in the manner of the ancients. Nor was he&nbsp;leſs regardleſs of the perſons he condemned, than cruel&nbsp;in the infliction of their puniſhment. Such was his extreme ſtupidſty, that he would frequently invite thoſe&nbsp;to ſupper whom he had put to death but the day before ; and often denied the having given orders for&nbsp;an execution, but a few hours after pronouncing ſentence. Suetonius aſſures us, that there were no leſs&nbsp;than 35 ſenators, and above 300 knights, executed in&nbsp;his reign ; and that ſuch was hie unconcern in the midſt&nbsp;of ſlaughter, that one of the tribunes bringing him an&nbsp;account of a certain ſenator who was executed, he quite&nbsp;forgot his offence, but calmly acquieſced in his puniſhment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In this manner was Claudius urged on by Meſſalina to commit cruelties, which he conſidered only as wholeſome ſeverities ; while, in the mean time, ſhe put no&nbsp;bounds to her enormities. The impunity of her paſt&nbsp;vices only increaſing her confidence to commit new,&nbsp;her debaucheries became every day more notorious, and&nbsp;her lewdneſs exceeded what had ever been ſeen at Rome.&nbsp;She cauſed ſome women of the firſt quality to commit&nbsp;adultery in the pr eſence of their huſhands, and deſtroyed ſuch as refuſed to comply. After appearing for</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">ſome years inſatiable in her deſires, ſhe at length fixed her affections upon Caius Silius, the moſt beautiful&nbsp;youth in Rome. Her love for the young Roman ſeemed to amount even to madneſs. She obliged him to divorce his wiſe Junia Syllana, that ſhe might entirely&nbsp;poſſeſs him herſelf. She obliged him to accept of&nbsp;immenſe treaſures and valuable preſents ; cohabiting&nbsp;with him in the moſt open manner, and treating hi n&nbsp;with the moſt ſhameleſs familiarity. The very imperial ornaments were transferred to his houſe ; and the&nbsp;emperor’s ſlaves and attendants had orders to wait upon the adulterer. Nothing was wanting to complete&nbsp;the inſolence of their conduct, but their being married&nbsp;together ; and this was ſoon after effected. They relied upon the emperor’s imbecility for their ſecurity,&nbsp;and only waited till he retired to Oſtia to put their ill-judged project in execution. In his abſence, they celebrated their nuptials with all the ceremonies and&nbsp;ſplendor which attend the moſt confident ſecurity.&nbsp;Meſſalina gave a looſe to her paſſion, and appeared as a&nbsp;Bacchanalian with a thyrſus in her hand ; while Silius&nbsp;aſſumed the character of Bacchus, his body being&nbsp;adorned with robes imitating ivy, and his legs covered&nbsp;with buſhins. A troop of fingers and dancers attend,&nbsp;ed, who heightened thg revel with the moſt laſcivious&nbsp;ſongs and the moſt indecent attitudes. In the midſt&nbsp;of this riot, one Valens, a buffoon, is ſaid to have climbed a tree ; and being demanded what he ſaw, anſwered&nbsp;that he perceived a dreadſul ſtorm coming from Oſtia.&nbsp;What this fellow ſpoke at random was actually at that&nbsp;time in preparation. It ſeems that ſome time before&nbsp;there had been a quarrel between Meſſalina and Narciſſus, the emperor’s firſt freedman. This ſubtle miniſter&nbsp;therefore deſired nothing more than an opportunity&nbsp;of ruining the empreſs, and he judged this to be a&nbsp;moſt favourable occaſion. He firſt made the diſcovery by means of two concubines who attended the emperor, who were inſtructed to inform him of Meſſa-lina’s marriage as the news of the day, while Narciſſus&nbsp;himſelf ſtepped in to confirm their information. Finding it operated upon the emperor’s fears as he could&nbsp;wiſh, he reſolved to alarm him ſtill more by a diſcovery&nbsp;of all Meſſalina’s projects and attempts. He aggravated the danger, and urged the expediency of ſpeed sly&nbsp;puniſlimg the delinquents. Claudius, quite terrified at&nbsp;ſo unexpected a relation, ſuppoſed the enemy were already at his gates ; and frequently interrupted his&nbsp;freedman, by aſking if he was ſtill maſter of the empire. Being aſſured that he yet had it in his power to&nbsp;continue ſo, he reſolved to go and puniſh the affront&nbsp;offered to his dignity without delay. Nothing could&nbsp;exceed the conſternation of Meſſalina and her thought-leſs companions, upon being informed that the emperor was coming to diſturb tſheir feſtivity. Every one&nbsp;retired in the utmoſt confuſion. Silius was taken.&nbsp;Meſſalina took ſhelter in ſome gardens which ſhe had&nbsp;lately ſeized upon, having expelled Aſiaticus the true&nbsp;owner, and put him to death. From thence ſhe ſent&nbsp;Britannicus, her only ſon by the emperor, with Octavia&nbsp;her daughter, to intercede for her, and implore his&nbsp;mercy. She ſoon after followed them herſelf ; but&nbsp;Narciſſus had ſo fortified the emperor againſt her arts,&nbsp;and contrived ſuch methods of diverting his attention&nbsp;from her defence, that ſhe was obliged to return in deſpair. Narciſſus being thus far ſucceſsſul, led Claudius</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
