<p><span class="font1">Romans—the biremes, quadriremes, quinquiremes, and hexiremes—owed their pace to the exertions of men who&nbsp;plied the oar rather than to the sails with which they were&nbsp;fitted, and which were only used when the wind was&nbsp;favourable. Professor Gardner has shown that boat racing&nbsp;was not uncommon among the Greeks ;@@<sup>1</sup> and that it was&nbsp;practised among the Romans Virgil testifies in the well-known passage in the fifth book of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Æneid.</span><span class="font1"> And the&nbsp;Venetian galleys which were subsequently used on the&nbsp;shores of the Mediterranean in mediaeval times were only&nbsp;a modified form of the older kind of craft. These were&nbsp;for the most part manned by slaves and criminals, and&nbsp;were in constant employment in most European countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rowing was understood by the ancient Britons, as they trusted themselves to the mercy of the waves in coracles&nbsp;composed of wicker-work covered with leather, similar no&nbsp;doubt in many respects to those now used in Wales ; but&nbsp;these frail vessels were propelled by paddles and not by&nbsp;oars. The Saxons seem to have been expert in the&nbsp;management of the oar, as well as the Danes and Norwegians, as it is recorded that the highest nobles in the land&nbsp;devoted themselves to it. Alfred the Great introduced&nbsp;long galleys from the Mediterranean, which were propelled&nbsp;by forty or sixty oars on each side, and for some time&nbsp;these vessels were used for war purposes. It is stated by&nbsp;William of Malmesbury that Edgar the Peaceable was&nbsp;rowed in state on the river Dee from his palace, in the&nbsp;city of West Chester, to the church of St John and back&nbsp;again, by eight tributary kings, himself acting as&nbsp;coxswain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Boat quintain, or tilting at one another on the water, was first brought into England by the Normans as an&nbsp;amusement for the spring and summer season, and probably much of the success of the champions depended&nbsp;upon the skill of those who managed the boats. Before&nbsp;the beginning of the 12th century the rivers were&nbsp;commonly used for conveying passengers and merchandise&nbsp;on board barges and boats, and until the introduction of&nbsp;coaches they were almost the only means of transit for&nbsp;royalty, and for the nobility and gentry who had mansions&nbsp;and watergates on the banks of the Thames. It is, however, impossible to trace the first employment of bargemen,&nbsp;wherrymen, or watermen, but they seem to have been well&nbsp;established by that time, and were engaged in ferrying and&nbsp;other waterside duties. During the long frosts of the early&nbsp;part of the 13th century, frequent mention is made in the&nbsp;chronicles of the distress among the watermen, from which&nbsp;we may assume that their numbers were large. They were&nbsp;employed in conveying the nobles and their retinues to&nbsp;Runnymede, where they met King John and where Magna&nbsp;Charta was signed. Towards the close of this century the&nbsp;watermen of Greenwich were frequently fined for overcharging at the established ferries, and about the same&nbsp;time some of the city companies established barges for&nbsp;water processions. We learn from Fabian and Middleton&nbsp;that in 1454 “Sir John Norman, then lord mayor of&nbsp;London, built a noble barge at his own expense, and was&nbsp;rowed by watermen with silver oars, attended by such of&nbsp;the city companies as possessed barges, in a splendid&nbsp;manner,” and further “ that he made the barge he sat in&nbsp;burn on the water”; but there is no explanation of this&nbsp;statement. Sir John Norman was highly commended for&nbsp;this action by the members of the craft, as no doubt it&nbsp;helped to popularize the fashion then coming into vogue of&nbsp;being rowed on the Thames by the watermen who plied&nbsp;for hire in their wherries. Tho lord mayor’s procession&nbsp;by water to Westminster, which figures on the front page&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Illustrated London Neτvs,</span><span class="font1"> was made annually until&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">the year 1856,</span><span class="font1"> when it was discontinued. The lord</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">mayor’s state barge was a magnificent species of shallop rowed by watermen ; and the city companies had for the&nbsp;most part barges of their own, all rowed double-banked&nbsp;with oars in the fore half, the after part consisting of a&nbsp;cabin something like that of a gondola. The watermen&nbsp;became by degrees so large and numerous a body that in&nbsp;the sixth year of the reign of Henry VIIL (1514) an&nbsp;Act was passed making regulations for them. This Act&nbsp;has from time to time been amended by various statutes,&nbsp;and the last was passed in 1858. Much time seems to&nbsp;have been spent in pleasuring on the water in the 15th&nbsp;and 16th centuries, and no doubt competitions among&nbsp;the watermen were not uncommon, though there is no&nbsp;record of them. The principal occupation of watermen,&nbsp;who were obliged to serve an apprenticeship, used to be&nbsp;ferrying and rowing fares on the Thames, but in process&nbsp;of time the introduction of bridges and steamers drove&nbsp;them from this employment, and the majority of them&nbsp;now w<sup>τ</sup>ork as bargemen, lightermen, and steamboat hands,&nbsp;having still to serve an apprenticeship. For many years&nbsp;matches for money stakes were frequent (1831 to 1880),&nbsp;but the old race of watermen, of which Phelps, the senior&nbsp;Kelley, Campbell, Coombes, Newell, the MacKinneys,&nbsp;Messenger, Pocock, and Henry Kelley were prominent&nbsp;members, has almost died out, and some of the best English&nbsp;scullers during the last fifteen years have been landsmen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Apart from the reference already made to the ancients, we do not find any records of boat-racing before the&nbsp;establishment in England of the coat and badge, instituted by the celebrated comedian Thomas Doggett in&nbsp;1715, in honour of the house of Hanover, to commemorate the anniversary of “ King George I.’s happy accession&nbsp;to the throne of Great Britain.” The prize was a red coat&nbsp;with a large silver badge on the arm, bearing the white&nbsp;horse of Hanover, and the race had to be rowed on the 1st&nbsp;of August annually on the Thames, by six young watermen&nbsp;who were not to have exceeded the time of their apprenticeship by twelve months. Although the first contest took&nbsp;place in the year above mentioned, the names of the&nbsp;winners have only been preserved since 1791. The race&nbsp;continues at the present day, but under slight modifications. The first regatta appears to have occurred about&nbsp;sixty years later, for we learn from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Annual Register</span><span class="font1"> of&nbsp;the year 1775 that an entertainment called by that name&nbsp;(Ital., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">regata),</span><span class="font1"> introduced from Venice into England, was&nbsp;exhibited on the Thames off Ranelagh Gardens, and a&nbsp;lengthy account of it is given at the end of the work. The&nbsp;lord mayor’s and several of the city companies’ pleasure&nbsp;barges were conspicuous, and, although we learn very little&nbsp;indeed of the competing wager boats, it seems clear they&nbsp;were rowed by watermen. We find from Strutt’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sports&nbsp;and Pastimes</span><span class="font1"> (first published in 1801) that the proprietor of&nbsp;Vauxhall Gardens had for some years given a new wherry&nbsp;to be rowed for by watermen, two in a boat, which is&nbsp;perhaps the first pair-oared race on record. Similar prizes&nbsp;w<sup>τ</sup>ere also given by Astley, the celebrated horseman and&nbsp;circus proprietor of the Westminster Bridge Road, about the&nbsp;same period ; but thus far rowing was apparently viewed&nbsp;as a laborious exercise, and the rowers were paid. At the&nbsp;commencement of the present century, however, rowing associations were formed, and the “ Star,” “ Arrow,” “ Shark,”&nbsp;and “ Siren ” Clubs had races amongst themselves, generally over long courses and in heavy six-oared boats. The&nbsp;Star and Arrow Clubs ceased to exist in the early years&nbsp;of this century, and were merged in the newly formed&nbsp;Leander Club. The date of its establishment cannot be&nbsp;fixed exactly, but it was probably about 1818 or 1819.&nbsp;It ranked high, because the majority of its members had&nbsp;frequently distinguished themselves in matches with the&nbsp;oar and sculls. They were the first to patronize and lend</span></p>
