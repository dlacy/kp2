His tragedy will ſhow, that his talents for poetry were by no means equal to thoſe whoſe poems he has publicly •cenſured. But though he has no title to the appellation of <hi rend="italic">poet</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">critic,</hi>  as an antiquarian and hiſtorian his memory will long be preſerved. His <hi rend="italic">Faedera,</hi>  which is a collection of all the public tranſactions, treaties, &amp;c. of the kings of England with foreign princes, is eſteemed one of our moſt authentic and valuable records, and is oftener referred to- by the beſt Engliſh hiſtorians than perhaps any other book in the language. It was publiſhed at London in the beginning of the preſent century in 17 volumes folio. Three volumes more were added by Sanderſen after Rymer’s death. The whole were reprinted at the Hague in 10 vols in 1739. They were abridged by Rapin in French, and inſerted in Le Clerc’s <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque,</hi>  a tranſlation of which was made by Stephen Whatley, and printed in 4 vols 8vo, 1731.</p><p>Rymer died 1 4th December 1713, and was buried in the pariſh church of St Clement’s Danes. Some ſpecimens of his poetry are preſerved in the ſirſt volume •of Mr NichoΓs Select Collection of Miſcellaneous Poems, 1780.</p><p>RYNCHOPS, in ornithology, a genus belonging to the order of anſeres. The bill is ſtraight ; and the ſuperior mandible much ſhorter than the inferior, which is truncated at the po⅛t. The ſpecies are two, viz. the nigra and fulva, both natives of America.</p><p>RYOTS, in the policy of Kindoſtan, the modern name by which the renters of land are diſtinguiſhed. They hold their poſſeſſions by a leaſe, which may be ■conſidered as perpetual, and at a rate fixed by ancient ſurveys and valuations. This arrangement hâs been ſo long eſtabliſhed, and accords ſo well with the ideas of the natives, concerning the diſtinction of caſts, and the fonctions allotted to each, that it has been invariably maintained in all the provinces ſubject either to Mahometans or Europeans ; and to both it ſerves as the ba-ſis on which their whole ſyſtem ot finance is founded.</p><p>Reſpecting the preciſe mode, however, in which the ryots of Hindoſtan held their poſſeſſions, there is much diverſity of opinion ; the chief of which are very impartially delineated in note iv. to the Appendix ol Ro-bertſon’s Hiſtorical Diſquiſition, &amp;c. concerning India·, p. 347. to which we refer ſuch of our readers as are in-tereſted in this ſubject of finance.</p><p>RYSCHIA, in botany : A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the pentandria claſs of plants ; and in the natural method ranking with thoſe that are doubtful. The calyx is pentaphyllous ; the corolla is pentapetalous ; and the apices turned back, about three times the length of the calyx ; the filaments are five» awl-ſhaped, and ſhorter than the petals. The ſeed-veſſel is quadrilocular, and contains many ſeeds. Of this there are two ſpecies, viz. the <hi rend="italic">Claujiſolia</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Sou-roubea.</hi></p><p>RYSWICK, a large village in Holland, ſeated between the Hague and Delft, where the prince of O-range has a palace, which ſtands about a quarter of a mile farther. It is a very noble ſtructure, all of hewn ſtone, of great extent in front, but perhaps not propor-tionably high. It is adorned with a marble ltair-caſe, marble floors, and a magnificent terrace. There is a good proſpect of it from the canal between Delft and the Hague. This place is remarkable for a treaty concluded here in 1697 between England, Germany, Holland, France, and Spain. E.
