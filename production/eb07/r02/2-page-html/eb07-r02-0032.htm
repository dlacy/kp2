<p><span class="font1">We may with safety proceed on the supposition, that the force necessary for overcoming the resistance arising from&nbsp;a rebound is as the square of the velocity ; and it is reasonable to suppose it proportional to the square of the sine&nbsp;of the angle of incidence, and this for the reasons given&nbsp;for adopting this measure of the general </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Resistance of&nbsp;Fluids.</span><span class="font1"> It cannot, however, claim a greater confidence&nbsp;here than in that application ; and it has been shown in that&nbsp;article with what uncertainty and limitations it must be received. We leave it to our readers to adopt either this or&nbsp;the simple ratio of the sines, and shall abide by the duplicate ratio with Du Buat, because it appears by his experiments that this law is very exactly observed in tubes in&nbsp;inclinations not exceeding 40° ; whereas it is in these small&nbsp;angles that the application to the general resistance of fluids&nbsp;is most in fault. But the correction is very simple if this&nbsp;value shall be found erroneous. There can be no doubt that&nbsp;the force necessary for overcoming the resistance will increase as the number of rebounds. Therefore we may express</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the resistance, in general, by the formula </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r = --—— ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">m</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">where </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font1"> is the resistance, V the mean velocity of the stream, sin. I the sine of the angle of incidence, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font1"> the number of equal&nbsp;rebounds (that is, having equal angles of incidence), and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">m&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">is a number to be determined by experiment. Du Buat&nbsp;made many experiments on the resistance occasioned by the&nbsp;bendings of pipes, none of which differed from the result of&nbsp;the above formula above one part in twelve ; and he concludes, that the resistance to one bend may be estimated at&nbsp;V<sup>2</sup> sin.<sup>2</sup></span><span class="font2">1</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:line-through;">- gθθθ</span><span class="font1">—∙ The experiment was in this form. A pipe of one</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">inch diameter, and ten feet long, was formed with ten rebounds of 36° each. A head of water was applied to it, which gave the water a velocity of six feet per second.&nbsp;Another pipe of the same diameter and length, but without&nbsp;any bendings, was subjected to a pressure of a head of water, which was increased till the velocity of efflux was also&nbsp;six feet per second. The additional head of water was 5-⅛&nbsp;inches. Another of the same diameter and length, having&nbsp;one bend of 24° 34', and running eighty-five inches per second, was compared with a straight pipe having the same&nbsp;velocity, and the difference of the heads of water was -⅛j of&nbsp;an inch. A computation from these two experiments will give</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">V<sup>2</sup> sin.<sup>2</sup> I</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the above result, or, in English measure, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r = - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">— <sup>ver</sup>y</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">nearly. It is probable that this measure of the resistance is too great ; for the pipe was of uniform diameter even in the&nbsp;bends : whereas, in a river properly formed, where the regimen is exact, the capacity of the section of the bend is increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The application of this theory to inclined tubes and to open streams is very obvious, and very legitimate and safe.&nbsp;Let AB (fig. 19) be the whole height of the reservoir AB1K,&nbsp;and BC the horizontal length of a pipe, containing any&nbsp;number of rebounds, equal or unequal, but all regular, that&nbsp;is, constructed according to the conditions formerly mentioned. The whole head of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">water should be conceived as</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">performing, or as divided into</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">portions which perform, three</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">different offices. One portion,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">V<sup>t</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">AD =-— , impels the water in-o09</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">to the entry of the pipe with the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">velocity with which it really</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">moves in </span><span class="font2">it; </span><span class="font1">another portion</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">EB is in equilibrio with the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">resistances arising from the mere length of the pipe ex</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">panded into a straight line ; and the third portion 1 serves to overcome the resistance of the bends. If, the&nbsp;fore, we draw the horizontal line BC, and, taking the p&nbsp;BC out of its place, put it in the position DH, with&nbsp;mouth C in H, so that DH is equal to BC, the water v&nbsp;have the same velocity in it that it had before. I&nbsp;greater simplicity of argument, we may suppose that wl&nbsp;the pipe was inserted at B, its bends lay all in a horizon&nbsp;plane, and that when it is inserted at D, the plane in whi&nbsp;all its bends lie slopes only in the direction DH, and is p</span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font1">&nbsp;pendicular to the plane of the figure. We repeat it, t&nbsp;water will have the same velocity in the pipes BC and D&nbsp;and the resistances will be overcome. If we now prolo&nbsp;the pipe DH towards L to any distance, repeating contin&nbsp;ally the same bendings in a series of lengths, each equal&nbsp;DH, the motion will be continued with the velocity con&nbsp;sponding to the pressure of the column AD ; because t&nbsp;declivity of the pipe is augmented in each length equal&nbsp;DH, by a quantity precisely sufficient for overcoming all t&nbsp;resistances in that length ; and the true slope in these cas&nbsp;is BE + ED, divided by the expanded length of the pi&nbsp;BC or DH.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The analogy which we were enabled to establish betwe the uniform motion or the train of pipes and of open strean&nbsp;entitles us now to say, that when a river has bendin;&nbsp;which are regularly repeated at equal intervals, its slope&nbsp;compounded of the slope which is necessary for overcomiι&nbsp;the resistance of a straight channel of its whole expand</span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font1">&nbsp;length, agreeably to the formula for uniform motion, and&nbsp;the slope which is necessary for overcoming the resistnn</span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font1">&nbsp;arising from its bending alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thus, let there be a river which, in the expanded cour of 6000 fathoms, has 10 elbows, each of which has 30°&nbsp;rebound ; and let its mean velocity be 20 inches in a s&nbsp;cond. If we should learn its whole slope in this 6000 f&nbsp;thorns, we must first find (by the formula of uniform m&nbsp;tion) the slope s which will produce the velocity of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">inches in a straight river of this length, section, and met&nbsp;depth. Suppose this to be 5-r⅜∏jj&gt; or 20 inches, in this who</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">λ V® sin? I</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">length. We must then find by the formula —&lt;¼yθ<sub>t</sub>j— <sup>t</sup>'</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">slope necessary for overcoming the resistance of ten r bounds of 30° each. This we shall find to be 6y inch&nbsp;in the 6000 fathoms. Therefore the river must have&nbsp;slope of 261 inches in 6000 fathoms, or yg½(yit &gt; <sup>a</sup>∏d d&nbsp;slope will produce the same velocity which 20 inches,&nbsp;3T⅛ira&gt; <sup>w0u</sup>lfi do in a straight-running river of tile san&nbsp;length.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Having thus established a theory of a most importa part of hydraulics, which may be confided in as a just r&nbsp;presentation of nature’s procedure, we shall apply it to tl&nbsp;examination of the chief results of every thing which a&nbsp;has contrived for limiting the operations of nature, or m</span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font1">&nbsp;difying them so as to suit our particular views. Trustir&nbsp;to the detail which we have given of the connecting priι&nbsp;ciples, and the chief circumstances which co-operate&nbsp;producing the ostensible effect ; and supposing that su&lt;&nbsp;of our readers as are interested in this subject will n&nbsp;think it too much trouble to make the applications in tl&nbsp;same detail ; we shall content ourselves with merely poin&nbsp;ing out the steps of the process, and showing their foui&nbsp;dation in the theory itself; and frequently, in place of tl&nbsp;direct analysis which the theory enables us to employ fi&nbsp;the solution of the problems, we shall recommend a pr&lt;&nbsp;cess of approximation by trial and correction, sufficient&nbsp;accurate, and more within the reach of practical engineeι</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
