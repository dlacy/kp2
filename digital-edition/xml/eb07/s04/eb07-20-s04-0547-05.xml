a village of Switzerland, remarkable from its position as the highest inhabited part of the most ancient road across the Alps, leading into the Austrian part of Italy from the countries through which the river Rhine passes. It is in the canton of the Grisons, and in the bailiwick of Schams. It contains a good hotel, which is also the post house, where relays of horses are always to be procured. It is 5928 feet above the level of the sea, and is surrounded with mountains of which the summits are perpetually' covered with snow. The descent from this spot, on both sides, excites the admiration of all travellers. To the south the road has been formed by the Austrian government. It is carried in traverses along the front of the rocky precipices, is of great breadth, with a very gradual descent ; and in several parts there are long galleries, covered with bomb proof arches, to prevent the road from being choaked by avalanches, or by the enormous masses of rocks that some times are liable to fall from the lofty summits. The road that descends on the northern side has been formed by the canton of the Grisons, and is tolerably good, but is not equal to the Austrian portion. The descent to Andeer is made with neither risk nor difficulty, and at that village, where there is a good hotel and posthouse, the most picturesque scenery commences. This road leads to Tussis, through what from antiquity has received the name of the <hi rend="italic">Via mala.</hi> It follows the course of the Rhine, sometimes far above it, sometimes close to its gulf, and frequently passing over it by strongly built bridges. It has two arched passages, cut with vast labour out of the solid rock. Splugen is sixteen miles from Chiavinna, in the Austrian territory ; and twenty from Tussis, in the canton of the Grisons.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
