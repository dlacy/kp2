This proceſs is repeated as often as neceſſity requires ; when done, if there be any moiſture remaining, they are dried in a ſtove, and made up into parcels wrapped up in wool ; after ſome time they are opened to the air, but wrapped up again as before, till ſuch time as the oil ſeems to have loſt all its force, which it ordinarily does in 24 hours. The ſkins are then returned from the mill to the chamoiſer to be ſcoured : which is done by putting them in a lixivium of wood-aſhes, working and beating them in it with poles, and leaving them to ſteep till the ley hath had its effect ; then they are wrung out, ſteeped in another lixivium, wrung again ; and this is repeated till all the greaſe and oil be purged out. When this is done, they are half dried, and paſſed over a ſharpedged iron inſtrument, placed perpendicular in a block, which opens, softens, and makes them gentle. Laſtly, they are thoroughly dried, and paſſed over the ſame inſtrument again ; which finiſhes the preparation, and leaves them in form of shammy.</p><p>Kid and goat-ſkins are ſhamoiſed in the ſame manner as thoſe of sheep, excepting that the hair is taken off without the uſe of any lime ; and that when brought from the mill they undergo a particular preparation called <hi rend="italic">ramalling,</hi> the moſt delicate and difficult of all the others. It conſiſts in this, that, as ſoon as brought from the mill, they are ſteeped in a fit lixivium, taken out, ſtretched on a round wooden leg, and the hair is ſcraped off with the knife ; this makes them ſmooth, and in working to caſt a kind of fine knap. The difficulty is in ſcraping them evenly.</p><p>SHANK, or <hi rend="italic smallcaps">Shank-</hi><hi rend="italic">Painter,</hi> in a ſhip, is a ſhort chain faſtened under the foremaſt-ſhrouds, by a bolt, to the ſhip’s ſides, having at the other end a rope faſtened to it.

But the peculiar prerogative of the Shannon is its ſituation, running from north to ſouth, and separating the province of Connaught from Leinſter and Munſter, and of conſequence dividing the greateſt part of Ireland into what lies on the eaſt and that on the west of the river ; watering in its paſſage the valuable county of Leitrim, the plentiful (hire of Roſcommon, the fruitful county of Galway, and the pleaſant county of Clare ; the ſmall but fine ſhire of Longford, the King’s county, and fertile county of Meath in Leinſter, the populous county of Tipperary, the ſpacious ſhire of Limerick, and the rough but pleaſant county of Kerry in Munſter ; viſiting 10 counties in its paſſage, and having on its banks the following remarkable places, viz. Leitrim, Jameſtown, Laneſhorough, Athlone, Clonfert, Killaloe, and Limerick ; at 20 leagues below the latter it ſpreads gradually ſeveral miles in extent, ſo that ſome have conſidered its expanſion as a lake. It at laſt joins its waters to the ſea, being navigable all that way for the largeſt veſſels.</p><p>SHANSCRIT, the language of the Bramins of Hindoſtan.

The firſt lay between mount Tabor and the ſea of Tiberias ; the ſecond between the city of Cæsarea of Paleſtine, and Joppa ; and the third lay beyond Jordan. To give an idea of perfect beauty, Iſaiah said, the glory of Lebanon and the beauty of Carmel muſt be joined to the abundance of Sharon. (Iſaiah xxxiii. 9. xxxi. 2.) The plains of Sharoa are of vaſt extent ; and, when ſurveyed by the Abbé Mariti a few years ago, they were ſown with cucumbers ; and he informs us, that ſuch a number is annually produced, as not only to ſupply the whole neighbourhood, but alſo all the coaſts of Cyprus and the city of Damietta. In the middle of the plain, between Arſus and Lydda, riſes a ſmall mountain, upon the ridge of which there is a ſmall village called Sharon, from the name of the ancient city whoſe king was conquered by Joſhua.</p><p>SHARP (James), archbi(hop of St Andrew’s, was born of a good family in Banffshire in 1618. He devoted himſelf very early to the church, and was educated for that purpoſe in the Univerſity of Aberdeen. When the ſolemn league and covenant was framed in 1638, the learned men in that ſeminary, and young Sharp in particular, declared themſelves decidedly againſt it. To avoid the inſults and indignities to which he was ſubjected in conſequence of this conduct, he retired to England, where he contracted an acquaintance with some of the moſt celebrated divines in that country.</p><p>At the commencement of the civil wars he returned to Scotland. During his journey thither, he accidentally met with Lord Oxenford, who was ſo charmed with his converſation, that he invited him to his houſe. While he reſided with Chat nobleman, he became known to the earl of Rothes, who procured him a profeſſorfhip at St Andrew’s. By the intereſt of the earl of Crawford he was ſoon after appointed miniſter of Crail ; where he conducted himſelf, it is ſaid, in an exemplary manner.</p><p>Sharp had always inclined to the cauſe of royalty, and had for ſome time kept up a correſpondence with his exiled prince. After the death of the protector he began to declare himſelf more openly, and ſeems to have enjoyed a great ſhare of the confidence of Monk, who was at that time planning the reſtoration of Charles II. When that general marched to London, the preſbyterians ſent Sharp to attend him in order to ſupport their intereſts. At the requeſt of general Monk and the chief preſbyterians in Scotland, Mr Sharp was ſoon af-</p></body></text></TEI>
