a city of Ontario, Canada, and the capital of Lincoln county, on the Welland Canal and the Grand Trunk, and St Catharines and Niagara Central railways, 35 m. S. of Toronto, with which it has steamer connexion. Pop. (1901) 9946. It is connected by electric tramways with the neighbouring towns and villages, and is in the midst of a fine fruit-growing district. Its excellent water-power provides motive force for numerous industries, among which are flour-mills and factories for the manufacture of edge tools and agricultural implements. Bishop Ridley College, under Anglican control, is an important residential school. There are mineral springs which are much visited by invalids.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
