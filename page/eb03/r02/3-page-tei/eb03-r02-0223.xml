From that time he was particularly noticed, and taken into the emperor’s body-guards, in which his aſſiduity and prompt obedience were particularly remarkable. In the reign of Caracalla, he was made a centurion, and diſtinguiſhed himſelf in this ſtation by his ſtrict attention to the morals and diſcipline of thoſe he commanded. When made a tribune, he ſtill retained the hard ſimplicity of his life ; eat as the meaneſt centinel ; ſpent whole days in exerciſing his troops ; and would now and then himſelf wreſtle with eight or ten of the ſtrongeſt men in the army, whom he threw with ſcarce any effort. Being thus become one of the moſt remarkable men in the empire, both for courage, diſcipline, and perſonal activity, he gave, ſhoit-ly after, a very high inſtance of his unſhaken fidelity : for when Macrinus was made emperor, he refuſed to ſerve under a prince that had betrayed his ſovereign ; and retired to Thrace, his native country, where he followed commerce, and purchaſed ſome lands, content with privacy rather; than a guilty dependence. Upon the acceſſion of Heliogabalus to the throne, this bold veteran once more returned to the army ; but was, in the very beginning, diſguſted at the baſe effeminacy of the emperor; who, hearing amazing inſtances of his ſtrength, aſhed him, if he were equally capable in combats of another nature ? This lewd demand was ſo little ſuitable to the temper of Maximimrs, that he inſtantly left the court. Upon the death of Heliogabalus, he again returned to Rome, and was received with great kindneſs by Alexander, who particularly recommended him to the ſenate, and made him commander of the fourth legion, which conſiſted of new-raiſed ſoldiers. Maximinus gladly accepted of this charge, and performed his duty with great exactneſs and ſucceſs, ſetting an example of virtue and diſcipline to all the commanders of the army. Nor was his valour leſs apparent againſt the Germans, whither he was ſent with his legion ; ſo that he was unanimouſly conſidered as the boldeſt, braveſt, moſt valiant, and moſt virtuous ſoldier in the whole empire. He ſoon, however, forfeited all theſe juſtly merited titles, when he was raiſed to the throne ; and, from being the moſt loved commander in the army, he became the moſt cruel tyrant upon earth. Yet in fact, his former virtues were all of the ſevere and rigid kind, which, without any education, might very eaſily degenerate into tyranny ; ſo that he might have miſtaken his ſucceeding cruelty for diſcipline, and his ſeverity for juſtice. However this he, Maximinus is conſidered as one of the greateſt monſters of cruelty that ever diſgraced power ; and, fearful of nothing himſelf, he ſeemed to ſport with the terrors of all mankind.</p><p>He began his reign, by endeavouring to force obedience from every rank of people, and by vindicating his authority by violence. The ſenate and people of Rome were the firſt that incurred his reſentment. They utterly refuſing to confirm the election of the army, he was the firſt emperor who reigned without their concurrence or approbation. However, he ſeem</p><lb/><p>ed regardleſs of their oppoſition, proceeding to ſecure his election by putting all ſuch to death as had been raiſed by his predeceſſor. The Chriſtians alſo, having found favour in the former reign, felt the weight of his reſentment ; and were perſecuted in ſeveral parts of the empire, particularly in thoſe where he himſelf reſided. His cruelty likewiſe extended to the rich, whoſe lives and eſtates became a frequent ſacriſice to avarice and ſuſpicion. But what appears ſtill a more extraordinary inſtance of his cruelty, being aſhamed of the meanneſs of his extraction, he commanded all ſuch as were beſt acquainted with him and his parentage to be ſlain, although there were ſome among the number that had relieved him in his low condition.</p><p>However, his cruelties did not retard his military operations, which were carried on with a ſpirit becoming a better monarch. He overthrew the Germans in ſeveral battles, waſted all their country with fire and ſword for 400 miſeo together, and ſet a reſolution of ſubduing all the northern nations as far as the ocean. In theſe expeditions, in order to attach the ſoldiers more firmly to him, he increaſed their pay ; and in every duty of the camp, he himſelſ took as much pains as the meaneſt centinel in his army, ſhowing incredible courage and aſſiduity. In every engagement, where the conflict was hotteſt, Maximinus was always ſeen fighting there in perſon, and deſtroying all before him : ſor, being bred a barbarian, he conſidered it as his duty to combat as a common ſoldier, while he commanded as a general.</p><p>In the mean time, his cruelties had ſo alienated the minds of his ſubjects, that ſeveral conſpiracies were ſecretly aimed againſt him. Magnus, a conſular perſon, and ſome others, had plotted to break down a wooden bridge, as ſoon as the emperor had paſſed it, and thus to abandon him to the enemy. But this being diſcovered, gave Maximinus an opportunity of indulging his natural ſeverity, upon this pretext alone cauſing above 4000 to be ſlain. Shortly after, ſome of Alexander’s old ſoldiers withdrawing themſelves from the camp, proclaimed one Quarcianus as emperor, who had been lately diſguſted at Maximinus for being diſmiſſed from employment. The ſoldiers, in fact, conſtrained him to accept of the dangerous ſuperiority to which he was expoſed : and ſhortly after, in the ſpirit of the times, the perſon who had been the promoter of his advancement, murdered him in his bed, and carried his head to Maximinus ; who received him kindly at firſt, but ſoon put him to a cruel death, for his complicated guilt of treaſon and treachery.</p><p>Theſe partial inſurrections were ſoon after followed by a ſpirit of general diſcontent throughout all the empire. The provinces of Africa were the firſt that ſhowed their deteſtation of the tyrant, whoſe extortions and cruelties among them were become inſupportable. They firſt flew his procurator ; and afterwards conſidering how dangerous a crime they had committed, they reſolved to throw off all expectations of pardon, and create a new emperor. Gordien was then , proconſul of Africa, a perſon of great ſame for his virtues, and highly reverenced for a blameleſs life of near 80. Him, therefore, they determined to elect ; and accordingly the ſoldiers and natives aſſembling together, tumultuouſly entered his houſe, reſolved to put. their deſign in execution.
