<p><span class="font0">worthy and learned man, whom he followed to the vigorous young university of Basel in 1474. At Basel Reuchlin took&nbsp;his master’s degree (1477), and began to lecture with success,&nbsp;teaching a more classical Latin than was then common in&nbsp;German schools, and also explaining Aristotle in Greek. His&nbsp;studies in this language had been continued at Basel under&nbsp;Andronicus Contoblacas, and here too he formed the acquaintance of the bookseller, Johann Amorbach, for whom he prepared&nbsp;a Latin lexicon </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Vocabularius Breviloquus,</span><span class="font0"> ist ed., 1475-76),&nbsp;which did good service in its time and ran through many editions.&nbsp;This first publication and Reuchlin’s account of his teaching at&nbsp;Basel in a letter to Cardinal Adrian (Adriano Castellesi) in&nbsp;Februaty 1518 show that he had already found the work which&nbsp;in a larger sphere occupied his whole life. He was no original&nbsp;genius, but a born teacher. But this work of teaching was not&nbsp;to be done mainly from the professor’s chair. Reuchlin soon&nbsp;left Basel to seek further Greek training with George Hieronymus&nbsp;at Paris, and to learn to write a fair Greek hand that he might&nbsp;support himself by copying MSS. And now he felt that he&nbsp;must choose a profession. His choice fell on law, and he was&nbsp;thus led to the great school of Orleans (1478), and finally to&nbsp;Poitiers, where he became licentiate in July 1481. From Poitiers&nbsp;ReuchIin went in December 1481 to Tübingen, with the intention of becoming a teacher in the university, but his friends&nbsp;recommended him to Count Eberhard of Württemberg, who&nbsp;was about to journey to Italy and required an interpreter.&nbsp;Reuchhn was selected for this post, and in February 1482 left&nbsp;Stuttgart for Florence and Rome. The journey lasted but a&nbsp;few months, but it brought the German scholar into contact&nbsp;with several learned Italians, especially at the Medicean Academy&nbsp;in Florence; his connexion with the count became permanent,&nbsp;and after his return to Stuttgart he received important posts&nbsp;at Eberhard’s court. About this time he appears to have&nbsp;married, but little is known of his married life. He left no&nbsp;children; but in later years his sister’s grandson Melanchthon&nbsp;was almost as a son to him till the Reformation estranged them.&nbsp;In 1490 he was again in Italy. Here he saw Pico della Mirandola,&nbsp;to whose Cabbalistic doctrines he afterwards became heir, and&nbsp;also made the friendship of the pope’s secretary, Jakob Questen-berg, which was of service to him in his later troubles. Again&nbsp;in 1492 he was employed on an embassy to the emperor Frederick&nbsp;at Linz, and here he began to read Hebrew with the emperor’s&nbsp;Jewish, physician Jakob ben Jehiel Loans. He knew something&nbsp;of this language before, but Loans’s instruction laid the basis of&nbsp;that thorough knowledge which he afterwards improved on his&nbsp;third visit to Rome in 1498 by the instruction of Obadja Sforno&nbsp;of Cesena. In 1494 his rising reputation had been greatly&nbsp;enhanced by the publication of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Verbo Mirifico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1496 Eberhard of Württemberg died, and enemies of ReuchIin had the ear of his successor, Duke Eberhard. He was&nbsp;glad, therefore, hastily to follow the invitation of Johann von&nbsp;Dalberg (1445-1503), the scholarly bishop of Worms, and flee&nbsp;to Heidelberg, which was then the seat of the “ Rhenish Society.”&nbsp;In this court of letters Reuchlin’s appointed function was to&nbsp;make translations from the Greek authors, in which his reading&nbsp;was already extremely wide. Though Reuchlin had no public&nbsp;office as teacher, and even at Heidelberg was prevented from&nbsp;lecturing, he was during a great part of his life the real centre&nbsp;of all Greek teaching as well as of all Hebrew teaching in&nbsp;Germany. To carry out this work he found it necessary to&nbsp;provide a series of helps for beginners and others. He never&nbsp;published a Greek grammar, though he had one in MS. for use&nbsp;with his pupils, but he put out several little elementary Greek&nbsp;books. Reuchlin, it may be noted, pronounced Greek as his&nbsp;native teachers had taught him to do, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> in the modern Greek&nbsp;fashion. This pronunciation, which he defends in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dialogus de&nbsp;Recta Lat. Graecique Serm. Pron.</span><span class="font0"> (1519), came to be known, in&nbsp;contrast to that used by Erasmus, as the Reuchlinian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At Heidelberg Reuchlin had many private pupils, among whom Franz von Sickingen is the best known name. With the&nbsp;monks he had never been liked; at Stuttgart also his great&nbsp;enemy was the Augustinian Conrad Holzinger. On this man he&nbsp;took a scholar’s revenge in his first Latin comedy </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sergius<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font0">  a&nbsp;satire on worthless monks and false relics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Through Dalberg, Reuchlin came into contact with Philip, elector palatine of the Rhine, who employed him to direct the&nbsp;studies of his sons, and in 1498 gave him the mission to Rome&nbsp;which has been already noticed as fruitful for Reuchlin’s progress in Hebrew. He came back laden with Hebrew books,&nbsp;and found when he reached Heidelberg that a change of government had opened the way for his return to Stuttgart, where his&nbsp;wife had remained all along. His friends had now again the&nbsp;upper hand, and knew Reuchlin’s value. In 1500, or perhaps&nbsp;in 1502, he was given a very high judicial office in the Swabian&nbsp;League, which he held till 1512, when h£ retired to a small estate&nbsp;near Stuttgart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For many years Reuchlin had been increasingly absorbed in Hebrew studies, which had for him more than a mere philological&nbsp;interest. Though he was always a good CathoUc, and even&nbsp;took the habit of an Augustinian monk when he felt that his&nbsp;death was near, he was too thorough a humanist to be a blind&nbsp;follower of the church. He knew the abuses of monkish religion,&nbsp;and was interested in the reform of preaching as shown in his&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Arte Predicandi</span><span class="font0"> (1503)—a book which became a sort of&nbsp;preacher’s manual; but above all as a scholar he was eager that&nbsp;the Bible should be better known, and could not tie himself to&nbsp;the authority of the Vulgate. The key to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hebraea veritas&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">was the grammatical and exegetical tradition of the medieval&nbsp;rabbins, especially of David Kimhi, and when he had mastered&nbsp;this himself he was resolved to open it to others. In 1506&nbsp;appeared his epoch-making </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Rudimentis Hebraicis</span><span class="font0">—grammar&nbsp;and lexicon—mainly after Kimhi, yet not a mere copy of one&nbsp;man’s teaching. The edition was costly and sold slowly. One&nbsp;great difficulty was that the wars of Maximilian I. in Italy&nbsp;prevented Hebrew Bibles coming into Germany. But for this&nbsp;also Reuchlin found help by printing the Penitential Psalms&nbsp;with grammatical explanations (1512), and other helps followed&nbsp;from time to time. But his Greek studies had interested him&nbsp;in those fantastical and mystical systems of later times with&nbsp;which the Cabbala has no small affinity. Following Pico, hé&nbsp;seemed to find in the Cabbala a profound theosophy which might&nbsp;be of the greatest service for the defence of Christianity and the&nbsp;reconciliation of science with the mysteries of faith—an unhappy&nbsp;delusion indeed, but one not surprising in that strange time of&nbsp;ferment. Reuchlin’s mystico-cabbalistic ideas and objects were&nbsp;expounded in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Verbo Mirifico<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font0">  and finally in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Arte&nbsp;Cabbalistica</span><span class="font0"> (1517).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Unhappily many of his contemporaries thought that the first step to the conversion of the Jews was to take from them their&nbsp;books. This view had for its chief advocate the bigoted Johann&nbsp;Pfefferkorn (1469-1521), himself a baptized Hebrew. Pfefferkorn’s plans were backed by the Dominicans of Cologne; and&nbsp;in 1509 he got from the emperor authority to confiscate all&nbsp;Jewish books directed against the Christian faith. Armed with&nbsp;this mandate, he visited Stuttgart and asked Reuchlin’s help&nbsp;as a jurist and expert in putting it into execution. Reuchlin&nbsp;evaded the demand, mainly because the mandate lacked certain&nbsp;formalities, but he could not long remain neutral. The execution of Pfefferkorn’s schemes led to difficulties and to a new&nbsp;appeal to Maximilian. In 1510 Reuchlin was summoned in the&nbsp;name of the emperor to give his opinion on the suppression of&nbsp;the Jewish books. His answer is dated from Stuttgart, October 6,&nbsp;1510; in it he divides the books into six classes—apart from&nbsp;the Bible which no one proposed to destroy—and, going through&nbsp;each class, he shows that the books openly insulting to Christianity are very few and viewed as worthless by most Jews&nbsp;themselves, while the others are either works necessary to the&nbsp;Jewish worship, which was licensed by papal as well as imperial&nbsp;law, or contain matter of value and scholarly interest which&nbsp;ought not to be sacrificed because they are connected with&nbsp;another faith than that of the Christians. He proposed that the&nbsp;emperor should decree that for ten years there be two Hebrew&nbsp;chairs at every German university for which the Jew's should&nbsp;furnish books. The other experts proposed that all books</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
