There are a&nbsp;normal school and a graded school system for both white&nbsp;and coloured pupils, Raleigh is a centre of the cotton&nbsp;and tobacco trades, has railway machine and car shops,&nbsp;and manufactures steam-engines, shuttle blocks and bobbins, ice, cotton-seed oil, fertilizers, hosiery, clothing, agricultural implements, carriages, carpentry, cigars, marble&nbsp;wares, Ac. The population was 4780 in 1860, 7790 (4094&nbsp;coloured) in 1870, and 9265 (4354 coloured) in 1880.&nbsp;Raleigh was selected as the seat of government in 1788,&nbsp;was laid out in 1792, and made a city in 1794.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RALEIGH, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Sir </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Walter </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1552-1618), admiral and courtier, was born at Hayes in Devonshire in 1552. After&nbsp;a short residence at Oriel College, Oxford, he took service&nbsp;in the autumn of 1569 with a body of volunteers serving&nbsp;in the French Huguenot army, and he probably did not&nbsp;return to England till 1576. During the course of these&nbsp;years he appears to have made himself master of seamanship, though no evidence of this is obtainable. In 1579&nbsp;he was stopped by the council from taking part in a&nbsp;voyage planned by his half-brother Sir Humphrey Gilbert,&nbsp;and in 1580 he commanded an English company in&nbsp;Munster (Ireland). On 10th November he took part in&nbsp;the massacre at Smerwick. He remained in Ireland till&nbsp;December 1581, distinguished for his vigour and ability as&nbsp;well as for his readiness to treat Irish rebels as mere wild&nbsp;beasts, who were to be pitilessly exterminated, and whose&nbsp;leaders might be smitten down if necessary by assassination. In one way or another Raleigh’s conduct gained the&nbsp;favourable notice of Elizabeth, especially as he had chosen&nbsp;to seek for the support of Leicester, in whose suite he is&nbsp;found at Antwerp in February 1582. For some years&nbsp;Raleigh shone as a courtier, receiving from time to time&nbsp;licences to export woollen cloths and to sell wine, after the&nbsp;system by which Elizabeth rewarded her favourites without expense to herself. In 1585 he became lord warden&nbsp;of the Stannaries, soon afterwards he was vice-admiral&nbsp;of Devon and Cornwall, and in 1587 was captain of the&nbsp;guard. But he was one of those who were dissatisfied&nbsp;unless they could pursue some public object in connexion&nbsp;with their chase after a private fortune. In 1583 he&nbsp;risked ¿£2000 in the expedition in which Sir Humphrey&nbsp;Gilbert perished. In 1584 he obtained a charter of&nbsp;colonization, and sent Amadas and Barlow to examine the&nbsp;country which he named Virginia. In 1585 he despatched&nbsp;a fleet laden with colonists. They were, however, soon&nbsp;discouraged and were brought back to England by Drake&nbsp;in the following year. Shortly afterwards fifteen fresh&nbsp;colonists were landed, and another party in 1587. All&nbsp;these, however, perished, and, though Raleigh did all that&nbsp;was possible to succour them, the permanent colonizing of&nbsp;Virginia passed into other hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1584 Raleigh obtained a grant of an enormous tract of land in Munster, in one corner of which he introduced&nbsp;the cultivation of the potato. To people that land with&nbsp;English colonists was but the counterpart of the attempt&nbsp;to exterminate its original possessors. This view of the&nbsp;policy of England in Ireland was not confined to Raleigh,&nbsp;but it found in him its most eminent supporter. In his&nbsp;haste to be wealthy, his love of adventure, his practical insight into the difficulties of the world, and his unscrupulousness in dealing with peoples of different habits and beliefs&nbsp;from his own, Raleigh was a representative Elizabethan&nbsp;Englishman. He did his best, so far as a usually absentee&nbsp;landlord could do, to make his colonists prosperous and&nbsp;successful; but he underestimated the extraordinary&nbsp;vitality of the Irish race, and the resistance which was</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">awakened by the harsh system of which he was the constant adviser at Elizabeth's court. Elizabeth, too, was unable to support him with the necessary force, and his&nbsp;whole attempt ended in failure. Raleigh’s efforts were&nbsp;at least made on behalf of a race whose own civilization and&nbsp;national independence were at stake. The Elizabethan men&nbsp;were driven to take large views of their difficulties, and it&nbsp;was impossible for Raleigh to separate the question whether&nbsp;English forms of life should prevail in Munster from the&nbsp;question whether they should be maintained in England.&nbsp;Two conceptions of politics and religion stood face to face&nbsp;from the Atlantic to the Carpathians, and every one of&nbsp;vigour took a side. The balancing intellects were silenced,&nbsp;or, like Elizabeth’s, were drawn in the wake of the champions of one party or the other. Wherever the strife was&nbsp;hottest Raleigh was sure to be found. If he could not&nbsp;succeed in Ireland he would fight it out with Spain. In&nbsp;1588 he took an active part against the Armada, and is&nbsp;even supposed by some to have been the adviser of the&nbsp;successful tactics which avoided any attempt to board the&nbsp;Spanish galleons. In 1589 he shared in the unsuccessful&nbsp;expedition commanded by Drake and Norris, and for some&nbsp;time vessels fitted out by him were actively employed in&nbsp;making reprisals upon Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Raleigh was a courtier as well as a soldier and a mariner, and as early as 1589 he was brought into collision with&nbsp;the young earl of Essex, who challenged him, though the&nbsp;duel was prevented. Some passing anger of the queen&nbsp;drove him in this year to visit Ireland, where he renewed&nbsp;his friendship with Spenser, and, as is told in poetic language in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Colin Clout’s come Home again</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, took the poet back&nbsp;with him to England, introduced him to Elizabeth, and&nbsp;persuaded him to proceed to the immediate publication of&nbsp;a portion of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Faerie Queen.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> If Raleigh could plead&nbsp;for a poet, he could also plead for a Puritan, and in 1591&nbsp;he joined Essex in begging for mercy for Udall. In the&nbsp;end of 1591 or the beginning of 1592 Raleigh seduced&nbsp;and subsequently married Elizabeth Throckmorton, and&nbsp;was consequently thrown into the Tower by Elizabeth,&nbsp;who could not endure that the fantastic love-making to&nbsp;herself which she exacted from her courtiers should pass&nbsp;into real affection for a younger woman. Previously to&nbsp;his imprisonment Raleigh had been forbidden to sail in&nbsp;command of a fleet of which a great part had been fitted out&nbsp;at his own cost for service against Spain. The ships, however, sailed, and succeeded in capturing a prize of extraordinary value known at the time as the “ Great Carrack.”&nbsp;No one but Raleigh was capable of presiding over the work&nbsp;of securing the spoils. He was sent to Plymouth, still in&nbsp;the name of a prisoner, where his capacity for business and&nbsp;his power of winning the enthusiastic affection of his subordinates were alike put to the test. The queen at last&nbsp;consented to restore him to complete liberty, though she&nbsp;tried to cheat him of his fair share of the booty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Raleigh resolved to use his regained liberty on an enterprise more romantic than the capture of a carrack. The fable of the existence of El Dorado was at that time&nbsp;fully believed in Spain, and in 1594 Raleigh sent out&nbsp;Captain Wheddon to acquire information about the lands&nbsp;near the Orinoco. In 1595 he sailed in person with five&nbsp;ships for Trinidad. On his arrival he found that the&nbsp;Spaniards, who had occupied a place called San Thome at&nbsp;the junction of the Orinoco and the Caroni, had been&nbsp;obliged to abandon it. Raleigh ascended the river to the&nbsp;spot, heard more about El Dorado from the Indians,&nbsp;brought away some stones containing fragments of gold,&nbsp;and returned to England to prepare a more powerful expedition for the following year. When he came back lies&nbsp;published an account of his voyage. The hope of enriching himself, and of giving to his country a source of wealth</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
