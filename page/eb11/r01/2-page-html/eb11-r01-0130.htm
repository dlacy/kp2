<p><span class="font1">Ranke married, at Windermere, in 1843, Miss Clara Graves, daughter of an Irish barrister. She died in 1870, leaving two&nbsp;sons and one daughter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the time of his death Ranke was, not in his own country alone, generally regarded as the first of modern historians.&nbsp;It is no disparagement to point out that the recognition he&nbsp;obtained was due not only to his published work, but also to&nbsp;his success as a teacher. His public lectures, indeed, were&nbsp;never largely attended, but in his more private classes, where&nbsp;he dealt with the technical work of a historian, he trained&nbsp;generations of scholars. No one since Heyne has had so great&nbsp;an influence on German academical life, and for a whole genera-tion the Berlin school had no rival. He took paternal pride&nbsp;in the achievements of his pupils, and delighted to see, through&nbsp;them, his influence spreading in every university. While his&nbsp;own work lay chiefly in more modern times, he trained in his&nbsp;classes a school of writers on German medieval history. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">As&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">must always happen, it is only a part of his characteristics&nbsp;which they learnt from him, for his greatest qualities were&nbsp;incommunicable. The critical method which has since become&nbsp;almost a formal system, aiming at scientific certainty, was&nbsp;with him an unexampled power, based on the insight acquired&nbsp;from wide knowledge, which enabled him to judge the credibility of an author or the genuineness of an authority; but&nbsp;he has made it impossible for any one to attempt to write&nbsp;modern history except on the “ narratives of eye-witnesses and&nbsp;the most genuine immediate documents ” preserved in the&nbsp;archives. From the beginning he was determined never to&nbsp;allow himself to be misled, in his search for truth, by those&nbsp;theories and prejudices by which nearly every other historian&nbsp;was influenced—Hegelianism, Liberalism, Romanticism, religious and patriotic prejudice; but his superiority to the&nbsp;ordinary passions of the historian could only be attained by&nbsp;those who shared his elevation of character. “ My object is&nbsp;simply to find out how the things actually occurred.” “ I&nbsp;am first a historian, then a Christian,’’ he himself said. In&nbsp;another way no historian is less objective, for in his greatest&nbsp;works the whole narrative is coloured by the quality of his&nbsp;mind expressed in his style. An enemy to all controversy and&nbsp;all violence, whether in act or thought, he had a serenity of&nbsp;character comparable only to that of Sophocles or Goethe.&nbsp;Apt to minimize difficulties, to search for the common ground&nbsp;of unity in opponents, he turned aside, with a disdain which&nbsp;superficial critics often mistook for indifference, from the base,&nbsp;the violent and the common. As in a Greek tragedy, we hear&nbsp;in his works the echo of great events and terrible catastrophes;&nbsp;we do not see them. He also made it a principle not to relate&nbsp;that which was already well known, a maxim which necessarily&nbsp;prevented his works attaining a popularity with the unlearned&nbsp;equal to their reputation among historians. But no writer has&nbsp;surpassed him in the clearness and brevity with which he could&nbsp;sum up the characteristics of an epoch in the history of the&nbsp;world, or present and define the great forces by which the world&nbsp;has been influenced. His classicism led to his great limitations&nbsp;as an historian. He did not deal with the history of the people,&nbsp;with economic or social problems—the dignity of history was&nbsp;to him a reality. He belonged to the school of Thucydides and&nbsp;Gibbon, not to that of Macaulay and Taine; he deals by preference with the rulers and leaders of the world, and he strictly&nbsp;limits his field to the history of the state, or, as we should say,&nbsp;political history; and in this he is followed by Seeley, one of&nbsp;the greatest of his adherents. The leader of modern historians,&nbsp;he was in truth a man of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ancien régime.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RANKINE, WILLIAM JOHN MACQUORN (1820-1872), Scottish engineer and physicist, was born at Edinburgh on the&nbsp;5th of July 1820, and completed his education in its university.&nbsp;He was trained as an engineer under Sir J. B. Macneill, working&nbsp;chiefly on surveys, harbours and railroads, and was appointed&nbsp;in 1855 to the chair of civil engineering in Glasgow, vacant by&nbsp;the resignation of Lewis Gordon, whose work he had undertaken&nbsp;during the previous session. He was a voluminous writer on&nbsp;subjects directly connected with his chair, and, besides contributing almost weekly to the technical journals, such as the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Engineer,</span><span class="font1"> brought out a series of standard textbooks on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Civil&nbsp;Engineering, The Steam-Engine and other Prime Movers,&nbsp;Machinery and Millwork, and Applied Mechanics,</span><span class="font1"> which have&nbsp;passed through many editions, and have contributed greatly&nbsp;to the advancement of the subjects with which they deal. To&nbsp;these must be added his elaborate treatise on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Shipbuilding, Theoretical and Practical.</span><span class="font1"> These writings, however, corresponded to but one phase of Rankine’s immense energy and&nbsp;many-sided character. He was an enthusiastic and most useful&nbsp;leader of the volunteer movement from its beginning, and a&nbsp;writer, composer and singer of humorous and patriotic songs,&nbsp;some of which, as “ The Three Foot Rule ’’ and “ They never&nbsp;shall have Gibraltar,” became well known far beyond the&nbsp;circle of his acquaintance. Rankine was the earliest of the&nbsp;three founders of the modem science of Thermodynamics&nbsp;(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q.v.</span><span class="font1">) on the bases laid by Sadi Carnot and J. P. Joule respectively, and the author of the first formal treatise on the subject.&nbsp;His contributions to the theories of Elasticity and of Waves&nbsp;rank high among modern developments of mathematical&nbsp;physics, although they are mere units among the 150 scientific&nbsp;papers attached to his name in the Royal Society’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Catalogue.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The more important of these were collected and reprinted in a&nbsp;handsome volume (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rankine's Scientific Papers,</span><span class="font1"> London, 1881),&nbsp;which contains a memoir of the author by Prof. P. G. Tait.&nbsp;Rankine died at Glasgow on the 24th of December 1872.</span></p>
