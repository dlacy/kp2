<p><span class="font2">mance, Gan, or Ganelon of Mayence, is always represented as a faithless traitor engaged in intrigues for the destruction of Christianity ; Roland as brave, unsuspicious, devotedly loyal, and somewhat simple in his disposition; Renaud,&nbsp;or Rinaldo, is painted with all the properties of a borderer,&nbsp;valiant, alert, ingenious, rapacious and unscrupulous. The&nbsp;same conventional distinctions may be traced in the history&nbsp;of the Nibelung, a composition of Scandinavian origin, which&nbsp;has supplied matter for so many Teutonic adventurers. Meister Hildebrand, Etzel, Thcodorick, and the champion Hogan,&nbsp;as well as Chrimhelda and the females introduced, have the&nbsp;same individuality of character, which is ascribed, in Homer’s&nbsp;immortal writings, to the wise Ulysses, the brave but relentless&nbsp;Achilles, his more gentle friend Patroclus, Sarpedon, the favourite of the gods, and Hector, the protector </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">mankind. It&nbsp;was not permitted to the invention of a Greek poet to make&nbsp;Ajax a dwarf, or Teucer a giant, Thersites a hero, or Diomedes a coward ; and it seems to have been under similar&nbsp;restrictions respecting consistency that the ancient romancers exercised their ingenuity upon the materials supplied&nbsp;them by their predecessors. But, in other respects, the&nbsp;whole store of romantic history and tradition was free to all&nbsp;as a joint stock in trade, on which each had a right to draw&nbsp;as suited his particular purposes. He was at liberty not&nbsp;only to select </span><span class="font3">a </span><span class="font2">hero out of known and established names&nbsp;which had been the theme of others, but to imagine a new&nbsp;personage of his own pure fancy, and combine him with the&nbsp;heroes of Arthur’s Table or Charlemagne’s Court, in the&nbsp;way which best suited his fancy. He was permitted to excite new wars against those bulwarks of Christendom, invade them with fresh and innumerable hosts of Saracens,&nbsp;reduce them to the last extremity, drive them front their&nbsp;thrones, and lead them into captivity, and again to relieve&nbsp;their persons, and restore their sovereignty, by events and&nbsp;agents totally unknown in their former story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the characters thus assigned to the individual personages of romantic fiction, it is possible there might be some slight foundation in remote tradition, as there were also&nbsp;probably some real grounds for the existence of such persons, and perhaps for a very few of the leading circumstances attributed to them. But these realities only exist&nbsp;as the few grains of wheat in the bushel of chaff, incapable&nbsp;of being winnowed out, or cleared from the mass of fiction&nbsp;with which each new romancer had in his turn overwhelmed them. So that romance, though certainly deriving its&nbsp;first original from the pure fount of history, is supplied, during the course of a very few generations, with so many tributes from the imagination, that at length the very name&nbsp;comes to be used to distinguish works of pure fiction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When so popular a department of poetry has attained this decided character, it becomes time to inquire who were&nbsp;the composers of these numerous, lengthened, and once admired narratives which are called metrical romances, and&nbsp;from whence they drew their authority. Both these subjects of discussion have been the source of great controversy&nbsp;among antiquaries; a class of men who, be it said with their&nbsp;forgiveness, are apt to be both positive and polemical upon&nbsp;the very points which are least susceptible of proof, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">which are least valuable if the truth could be ascertained ; and which, therefore, we would gladly have seen handled&nbsp;with more diffidence, and better temper, in proportion to&nbsp;their uncertainty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The late venerable Dr. Percy, Bishop of Dromore, led the way unwarily to this dire controversy, by ascribing the composition of our ancient heroic songs and metrical legends, in rather too liberal language, to the minstrels, that class of men&nbsp;by whom they were generally recited. This excellent person, to whose memory the lovers of our ancient lyre must&nbsp;always remain so deeply indebted, did not, on publishing his</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2">work nearly fifty years ago, see the rigid necessity of observing the utmost and most accurate precision either in his transcripts or his definitions. The study which he wished to introduce was a new one ; it was his object to place&nbsp;it before the public in an engaging and interesting form ;&nbsp;and, in consideration of his having obtained this important&nbsp;point, we ought to make every allowance not only for slight&nbsp;inaccuracies, but for some hasty conclusions, aud even exaggerations, with which he was induced to garnish his labour of love. He defined the minstrels, to whose labours&nbsp;he chiefly ascribed the metrical compositions on which he&nbsp;desired to fix the attention of the public, as “ an order of&nbsp;men in the middle ages, who subsisted by the arts of poetry&nbsp;and music, and sung to the harp verses composed by themselves or others.”@@<sup>1</sup> In a very learned and elegant essay&nbsp;upon the text thus announced, the reverend Prelate in a&nbsp;great measure supported the definition which he had laid&nbsp;down ; although it may be thought that, in the first editions&nbsp;at least, he has been anxious to view the profession of the&nbsp;minstrels on their fairest and most brilliant side ; and to assign to them a higher station in society than a general review of all the passages connected with them will permit&nbsp;us to give to a class of persons who either lived a vagrant&nbsp;life, dependent on the precarious taste of the public for a&nbsp;hard-earned maintenance, or, at best, were retained as a&nbsp;part of the menial retinue of some haughty baron, and in a&nbsp;great measure identified with his musical band.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The late acute, industrious, and ingenious Mr. Joseph Ritson. whose severe accuracy was connected with an unhappy eagerness and irritability of temper, took advantage&nbsp;of the exaggerations occasionally to be found in the Bishop’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Account of Ancient Minstrelsy,</span><span class="font2"> and assailed him with terms&nbsp;which may be termed any thing but courteous. Without&nbsp;finding an excuse either in the novelty of the studies in&nbsp;which Percy had led the way, or in the vivacity of imagination which he did not himself share, he proceeded to arraign&nbsp;each trivial inaccuracy as a gross fraud, and every deduction which he considered to be erroneous as a wilful untruth, fit to be stigmatised with the broadest appellation by&nbsp;which falsehood can be distinguished. Yet theςe is so little room for this extreme loss of temper, that, upon a recent&nbsp;perusal of both these ingenious essays, we were surprised&nbsp;to find that the reverend editor of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reliques,</span><span class="font2"> and the accurate antiquary, have differed so very little as, in essential&nbsp;facts, they appear to have done. Quotations are, indeed,&nbsp;made by both with no sparing hand, and hot arguments;&nbsp;and, on one side at least, hard words are unsparingly employed ; while, as is said to happen in theological polemics,&nbsp;the contest grows warmer in proportion as the ground concerning which it is carried on is narrower and more insignificant. Their systems, in reality,do not essentially differ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ritson is chiefly offended at the sweeping conclusion in which Percy states the minstrels as subsisting by the arts&nbsp;of poetry and music, and reciting to the harp verses composed by themselves and others. He shows very successfully that this definition is considerably too extensive, and&nbsp;that the term minstrel comprehended, of old, not merely&nbsp;those who recited to the harp or other instrument romances&nbsp;and ballads, but others who were distinguished by their&nbsp;skill in instrumental music only ; and, moreover, that jugglers, sleight-of-hand performers, dancers, tumblers,and such&nbsp;like subordinate artists, who were introduced to help away&nbsp;the tedious hours in an ancient feudal castle, were also comprehended under the general term of minstrel. But although&nbsp;he distinctly proves that Percy’s definition applied only to&nbsp;one class of the persons termed minstrels, those, namely, who&nbsp;sung or recited verses, and in many cases of their own composition ; the bishop’s position remains unassailable, in so&nbsp;far as relates to one general class, and these the most dis-</span></p>
