<p><span class="font0">properties are very numerous, the remaining two hundred and sixty-one estates being under L.500 Scotch. Several of&nbsp;these, exceeding a valuation of L.400 Scotch, and held of&nbsp;the crown, have been acquired by professional farmers.&nbsp;Among the seats in the county, which are too numerous to&nbsp;be mentioned here, the most splendid is Fleurs, the mansion of the Duke of Roxburghe, beautifully situated at the&nbsp;confluence of the Tweed and Teviot, near Kelso. Abbotsford, the seat of the late Sir Walter Scott, is also situated in&nbsp;this county. It is placed on a bank overhanging the south&nbsp;side of the Tweed, and is about half-way between Melrose and Selkirk. The property attached to it is judiciously laid out with thriving plantations; and in improving his&nbsp;land, Sir Walter gave a stimulus that has had the happiest&nbsp;effects on the agriculture and appearance of this beautiful&nbsp;district.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Roxburghshire is divided, for the most part, into larger farms, if we except a few sheep-farms in the Highlands,&nbsp;than any other county in Scotland ; many of them, consisting of land partly arable and partly pasture, being from&nbsp;1000 to 3000 acres, and several of these, in some instances,&nbsp;being in the occupation of one tenant. Farms altogether arable, containing from 500 to 1000 acres, are not uncommon.&nbsp;The capital and knowledge required for conducting concerns&nbsp;so extensive entitle such men to suitable accommodations&nbsp;in their houses and farm-offices, many of which are accordingly laid out and constructed in a superior style. The average rent of arable land varies from 15s. to L.2.10s. an acre,&nbsp;according to the quality of the soil and the distance from&nbsp;market. The rents of sheep-farms are calculated, not&nbsp;by the number of acres, but by the number of sheep&nbsp;that can be supported thereon. The grazing of an ox or&nbsp;cow, in various parts of the county, is from L.l. 10s. to L.7&nbsp;a year; that of a sheep from 5s. to L.l, one of the Cheviot&nbsp;breed being charged about one half less than one of the Leicester breed. Farms are generally let on leases at fifteen&nbsp;and nineteen years. On some of the Buccleuch estates it&nbsp;is nine years, but the leases are usually renewed at the end&nbsp;of that period. On other estates the leases vary from five&nbsp;to eleven years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Most of the farm-servants are married, and live in houses apart, set down together in some convenient quarter of the&nbsp;farm, each having a small garden attached. It is the practice here, as in other parts of the lowlands of Scotland, to pay&nbsp;most of their wages in the produce of the farm, and not in&nbsp;money, every married ploughman, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hind,</span><span class="font0"> getting a certain quantity of com, a cow kept, and some land allowed&nbsp;for potatoes, and often also for flax ; he is also commonly&nbsp;allowed to keep a pig and a few hens. The value of his&nbsp;income may be calculated to be between L.25 and L.28 a&nbsp;year. Whatever may be the fluctuation of the markets,&nbsp;these labourers are thus always provided with the necessaries of life ; and the sale of the butter made from their cow,&nbsp;with its calf, and the eggs of their poultry, and, if the family be not large, a part of their corn, supplies them with&nbsp;the other articles they need ; whilst they fatten their pigs,&nbsp;and work up the flax for the use of their families. No class&nbsp;of men of their rank are to be compared with these hinds&nbsp;for propriety of conduct and frugality ; and few of the labouring classes any where are so comfortable and contented with their condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The wages of a shepherd are much higher than those of a hind. These, however, fluctuate with the value of stock.&nbsp;Shepherds are allowed in many instances thirty sheep, the&nbsp;right of keeping a cow, with one or two pigs, and have&nbsp;besides a certain quantity of potato-ground. With these&nbsp;advantages, they realize considerable property, so that not&nbsp;a few are able in the course of years to take farms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The system of farming is generally what is called the four and five year shift rotation of cropping. The five-year&nbsp;shift is that which is now most generally adopted, and is</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">as follows: First year, fallow or turnip; second year, wheat, after plain fallow ; third and fourth years, grass ; fifth year,&nbsp;oats. There may be a variation after turnip in the second year, when barley or oats can be sown instead of the&nbsp;wheat, if the season is bad. Under a six years’ course,&nbsp;the most profitable on rather weak soils, and in a district&nbsp;where there are no large towns to furnish manure, the rotation from pasture is oats, turnips, barley or wheat, clover and rye-grass, partly cut for hay the first year, but&nbsp;chiefly pastured with sheep, and then continued in pasture&nbsp;two years longer. Under this system the crops are almost always good, and the land, instead of being exhausted, is kept in a state of progressive improvement. Though&nbsp;little of the soil be naturally adapted to wheat, yet this&nbsp;grain is now raised to a great extent on all the better&nbsp;descriptions of sandy loam; generally after turnips, which&nbsp;are eaten on the ground by sheep, which, by their treading, give consistency to the soil, as well as leave it greatly enriched by their manure. Only a small part is under beans, and somewhat more under pease ; barley has in&nbsp;many instances been superseded by wheat, so that wheat&nbsp;and oats are the principal crops of grain ; whilst, whatever&nbsp;be the number of acres in corn, nearly half the quantity is&nbsp;allotted to turnips, and the other half to clover and ryegrass. Potatoes occupy but a very small part of every&nbsp;farm ; and flax, where raised at all, is only in small patches&nbsp;for the use of the farm-servants. The turnip crop, however, has for a series of years been attacked with a disease&nbsp;which is popularly known by the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fingers and toes.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">It converts the bulb of the turnip, when one has been&nbsp;allowed to form, into a shapeless and morbid mass, which&nbsp;no animal will eat; and becomes putrid, and disappears&nbsp;altogether on the first approach of frost. It often prevails over extensive fields, whilst others adjoining escape;&nbsp;and it seems to make no difference whether the land be&nbsp;fresh from pasture or has been long in tillage. Various&nbsp;conjectures have been formed as to the cause or causes of&nbsp;this evil; and the general opinion is, that it is owing to the&nbsp;constant repetition, within a given time, of a turnip crop.&nbsp;To abate the evil, lime, and a proper attention to the change&nbsp;of rotation, are necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The pastoral district of this county is occupied with an excellent breed of sheep called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cheviot,</span><span class="font0"> from the general name of the hills on which they feed ; for an account of&nbsp;which breed we must refer to the article Agriculture.&nbsp;On the arable farms, the short-horned cattle and Leicester&nbsp;sheep, neither of them, however, always in a pure state,&nbsp;form the principal stock; and as so large a proportion of&nbsp;even the arable land is always in grass, the number of both&nbsp;is very great. On farms partly arable and partly hill-pasture, the cross between the Cheviot and the Leicester is&nbsp;found to answer very well. Many of the farmers of late&nbsp;have purchased Highland stots or kyloes at the Falkirk&nbsp;trysts, which have been wintered for a year and then sold&nbsp;to advantage. The greatest improvement recently made&nbsp;is sheep or surface drains, which have not only had the effect of drying the meadow and marshy land, and thereby&nbsp;adding to the fineness and thickness of the grass, but also&nbsp;of curing to a great extent the rot and several other disorders which afflicted the sheep. By means of turnips, most&nbsp;of the disposable stock, whether of cattle or sheep, are carried forward till they are ready for the butcher, when the&nbsp;far greater part is sent to the weekly market of Morpeth in&nbsp;Northumberland, for the consumption of Newcastle and&nbsp;other towns in the north of England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The progress which agriculture has made in this district has not been much favoured by its situation in regard to&nbsp;markets, coal, and lime. Weekly markets are held at&nbsp;Jedburgh, Hawick, and Kelso, where the corn is sold by&nbsp;sample upon very short credit, what is bought being paid&nbsp;for next market-day. Kelso market is the best attended,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
