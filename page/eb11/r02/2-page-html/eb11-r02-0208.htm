<p><span class="font2">pseudopod. Progression chiefly takes place by a rolling over </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font2">the anterior end (fig. 3—see also </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Amoeba);</span><span class="font2"> but it may take&nbsp;place by the extension of a pseudopod, its attachment at the tip,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">followed by its contraction to pull up the rest of the animal; this is well shown in the thecate species. Another mode is that&nbsp;of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A. radiosa</span><span class="font2"> (fig. I, 1-3), which can roll over on the tips of its&nbsp;stiff pseudopods. The pseudopods of the Filosa (figs. 6, 7)&nbsp;are branched, but less rich in granules, and less viscid than those&nbsp;of Foraminifera; they rarely anastomose, and never coalesce&nbsp;to form perforated plates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A process whose relations to reproduction are not fully made out is that of “ plastogamy,” where two or more individuals&nbsp;unite completely by their cytoplasm, the nuclei remaining&nbsp;distinct; it may be temporary or permanent: in the latter case</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">determining, of course, a much more rapid increase of size than that due to growth. Thanks to the labours of F. Schaudinn,&nbsp;we now know the full life cycles of at least half a dozen species;&nbsp;previously we only knew with certainty of two modes of&nbsp;fission—equal constriction </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Amoeba—</span><span class="font2">fig. 1, 1-3) and bud-fission&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Difflugia).</span><span class="font2"> As in other Sarcodina, chromidia, or fragments&nbsp;of nuclear substance budded off from the nucleus into the endoplasm, play an important part in many reproductive processes.&nbsp;Equal binary fission is common. In the thecate forms, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.&nbsp;Difflugia, Euglypha</span><span class="font2"> (fig. 4), this is replaced by bud-fission;&nbsp;half the cytoplasm passes out through the pylome, and becomes.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">invested with its covering there; the enclosed “ reserve’^ skeletal elements pass to the surface in order, so that the pylome&nbsp;of the new shell faces that of the old; the original nucleus divides.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in situ</span><span class="font2"> and one daughter nucleus passes into what we may call&nbsp;the bud-cytoplasm; the two daughters of the originàl cell,&nbsp;which we may call the “ bud-sister ” and the “ stock-sister ”&nbsp;respectively, now separate. In the plurinucleate forms a true&nbsp;bud-formation takes place, nucleate masses of cytoplasm being&nbsp;constricted off at the surface. A simultaneous resolution into&nbsp;uninucleate cells may affect the multinucleate species (or the&nbsp;multinucleate state of habitually uninucleate species); this is.&nbsp;termed schizogony.</span></p>
