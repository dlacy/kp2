            <bibl><title>Mourning Bride</title>, ad 2. sc. 8.</bibl>
            <p>No man, in his ſenſes, ever thought of applying his eyes to diſcover what passes in
                his mind ; far leſs of blaming his eyes for not ſeeing a thought or idea. In
                        <bibl><author>Moliere</author>’s <title>l'Avare</title> (act iv. ſc.
                    7.)</bibl> Harpagon, being robbed of his money, ſeizes himſelf by the arm,
                miſtaking it for that of the robber. And again he expreſſes himſelf as follows :</p>
            <sp>
                <p>Je veux aller querir la justice, et faire donner la question a toute ma maison ;
                    à servantes, à valets, à fils, à fille, et à moi auſſi.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>This is ſo abſurd as ſcarce to provoke a ſmile, if it be not at the author.</p>
            <p>Of the second branch the following example may fuſſice :</p>
            <sp>
                <l>—Now bid me run,</l>
                <l>And I will ſtrive with things <hi rend="italic">impossible,</hi></l>
                <l>Yea, get the better of them.</l>
            </sp>
            <bibl><title>Julius Caesar</title>, act 2. ſc. 3.</bibl>
            <p>Of the third branch, take the following ſamples. Lucan, talking of Pompey’s
                ſepulchre,</p>
            <sp>
                <l>—Romanum nomen, et omne</l>
                <l>Imperium magno est tumuli modus. Obrue saxa</l>
                <l>Crimine plena deûm. Si tota eſt Herculis Oete,</l>
                <l>Et juga tota vacant Bromio Nyseia ; quare</l>
                <l>Unus in Egypto Magno lapis ? Omnia Lagi</l>

            <bibl>L. viii. l. 798.</bibl>
            <p>Thus, in Rowe’s tranſlation :</p>
            <sp>
                <l>Where there are ſeas, or air, or earth, or ſkies,</l>
                <l>Where’er Rome’s empire ſtretches, Pompey lies.</l>
                <l>Far be the vile memorial then convey'd !</l>
                <l>Nor let this ſtone the partial gods upbraid.</l>
                <l>Shall Hercules all Oeta's heights demand,</l>
                <l>And Nyſa’s hill for Bacchus only ſtand ;</l>
                <l>While one poor pebble is the warrior's doom</l>
                <l>That fought the cauſe of liberty and Rome?</l>
                <l>If Fate decrees he muſt in Egypt lie,</l>
                <l>Let the whole fertile realm his grave ſupply,</l>
                <l>Yield the wide country to his awful ſhade, </l>
                <l>Nor let us dare on any part to tread, </l>
                <l>Fearful we violate the mighty dead. </l>
            </sp>
            <p>The following paſſages are pure rant. Coriolanus, speaking to his mother,</p>
            <sp>
                <l>What is this?</l>
                <l>Your knees to me? to your corrected ſon?</l>
                <l>Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach</l>
                <l>Fillop the ſtars : then let the mutinous winds</l>
                <l>Strike the proud cedars ’gainſt the fiery ſun:</l>
                <l>Murd’ring impoſſibility, to make</l>
                <l>What cannot be, flight work.</l>

                <l>But you, ere love milled your wand’ring eyes,</l>
                <l>Were ſure the chief and beſt of human race,</l>
                <l>Fram’d in the very pride and boaſt of nature,</l>
                <l>So perfect, that the gods who form’d you wonder’d</l>
                <l>At their own ſkill, and cry’d, A lucky hit</l>

            <p>Not to talk of the impiety of this ſentiment, it is ludicrous inſtead of being
                lofty.</p>
            <p>The famous <bibl>epitaph on Raphael</bibl> is not leſs abſurd than any of the
                foregoing paſſages :</p>
            <lg>
                <l>Raphael, timuit, quo ſoſpite, vinci,</l>
                <l>Rerum magna parens, et moriente mori.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Initiated by Pope, in his epitaph on Sir Godfrey Kneller:</p>
            <lg>
                <l>Living, great Nature fear’d he might outvie</l>
                <l>Her works ; and dying, fears herself may die.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Such is the force of imitation; for Pope of himſelf would never have been guilty of a
                thought ſo extravagant.</p>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">SENTINEL, or Sentry,</hi> in military affairs, a private soldier
                placed in ſome poſt to watch the approach of the enemy, to prevent ſurpriſes, to
                ſtop ſuch as would paſs without orders or diſcovering who they are. They are placed
                before the arms of all guards at the tents and doors of general officers, colonels

            <p>No perſon is to strike or abuſe a ſentry on his poſt; but when he has committed a

            <p>A ſentinel, on his poſt in the night, is to know nobody but by the counter-sign :

                (firſt ordering his party to reft, on which the sentry does the ſame), and gives him
