<p><span class="font0">the prostate the urethra runs more forward for about three-quarters of an inch, lying between the two layers of the triangular</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">ligament, both of which it pierces. This is known as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">membranous urethra,</span><span class="font0"> and is very narrow, being gripped by the&nbsp;compressor urethrae muscle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">spongy urethra</span><span class="font0"> is that part which is enclosed in the penis after piercing the anterior layer of the triangular ligament.&nbsp;At first it lies in the substance of the bulb and, later, of the&nbsp;corpus spongiosum, while finally it passes through the glans.&nbsp;In the greater part of its course it is a transverse slit, but in traversing the glans it enlarges considerably to form the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fossa&nbsp;navicularis,</span><span class="font0"> and here, in transverse section, it looks like an&nbsp;inverted T (1), then an inverted </span><span class="font1">Y </span><span class="font0">(A), and finally at its opening</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">(external meatus) a vertical slit. Into the whole length of the urethra mucous glands </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(glands of Littré)</span><span class="font0"> open, and in thc roof of</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">the fossa navicularis the mouth of one of these is sometimes so large that it may engage the point of a small catheter and is&nbsp;known as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lacuna magna.</span><span class="font0"> As a rule the meatus is the&nbsp;narrowest part of thc whole canal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Opening into the spongy urethra where it passes through the bulb are the ducts of two small glands known as Cowper’s&nbsp;glands, which lie on each side of the membranous urethra and&nbsp;are best seen in childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tho </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">penis</span><span class="font0"> is the intromittent organ of generation, and is made up of three cylinders of erectile tissue, covered by skin&nbsp;and subcutaneous tissue without fat. In a transverse section&nbsp;two of these cylinders (the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">corpora cavernosa) axe</span><span class="font0"> placed above,&nbsp;side by side, while one, thc </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">corpus spongiosum,</span><span class="font0"> is below. Posteriorly, at what is known as the root of the penis, the two&nbsp;corpora cavernosa diverge, become more and more fibrous in&nbsp;structure, and are attached on each side to the rami of the&nbsp;ischium, while the corpus spongiösum becomes more vascular&nbsp;and enlarges to form the bulb. It has already been pointed&nbsp;out that the whole length of the corpus spongiosum is traversed&nbsp;by the urethra. The anterior part of the penis is formed by&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">glans,</span><span class="font0"> a bell-shaped structure, apparently continuous with&nbsp;the corpus spongiosum, and having the conical ends of the corpora cavernosa fitted into depressions on its posterior surface.&nbsp;On the dorsum of the penis the rim of the bell-shaped glans&nbsp;projects beyond the level of the corpora cavernosa, and is</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">known as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">corona glandis.</span><span class="font0"> The skin of the penis forms a fold which covers the glans and is known as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">prepuce</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;foreskin; when this is drawn back a median fold, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">frenulum&nbsp;praeputn,</span><span class="font0"> is seen running to just below the meatus. After&nbsp;forming the prepuce the skin is reflected over the glans and&nbsp;here looks like mucous membrane. The structure of the corpora cavernosa consists of a strong fibrous coat, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tunica&nbsp;albuginea,</span><span class="font0"> from the deep surface of which numerous fibrous&nbsp;trabeculae penetrate the interior and divide it into a number&nbsp;of spaces which are lined with endothelium and communicate&nbsp;with the veins. Between the two corpora cavernosa the sheath&nbsp;is not complete and, having a comb-hke appearance, is known&nbsp;as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">septum pectinatum.</span><span class="font0"> The structure of the corpus&nbsp;spongiosum and glans resembles that of thc corpora cavernosa,&nbsp;but the trabeculae are finer and the network closer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ovary</span><span class="font0"> is an organ which in shape and size somewhat resembles a large almond, though its appearance varies considerably in different individuals, and at different times of life.&nbsp;It lies in the side wall of the pelvis with its long axis nearly&nbsp;vertical and having its blunt end (tubal pole) upward. Its&nbsp;more pointed lower end is attached to the uterus by the ligament of the ovary, while its anterior border has a short reflection&nbsp;of peritoneum, known as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mesovarium,</span><span class="font0"> running forward to&nbsp;the broad ligament of the uterus. It is through this anterior&nbsp;border that the vessels and nerves enter and leave the gland.</span></p>
