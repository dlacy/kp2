Cæſar’s men, though in the utmoſt diſtreſs for want of corn, yet bore all with’ incredible cheerfulneſs ; proteſting, that they would rather live upon the bark of trees than ſuffer Pompey to eſcape, now they had him in their power. Cæſar tells us, that in this extremity ſuch of the army as had been in Sardinia ſound out the way of making bread of a certain root called <hi rend="italic">citera,</hi>  which they ſteeped in milk ; and that when the enemy inſulted them on account of the ſtar-ving condition which they were in, they threw ſeveral of theſe loaves among them, to put them out of all hopes of ſubduing them by famine. “ So long as the earth produces ſuch roots (ſaid they), we will not let Pompey eſcape.” At length Pompey, alarmed at the diſtempers which began to prevail in his army, made ſeveral attempts to break through the barriers that incloſed him, but was always repulſed with loſs. At length, being reduced to the utmoſt extremity for want of forage, he reſolved at all events to force the enemy’s lines and eſcape. With the aſſiſtance, therefore, and by the advice of two deſerters, he embarked his archers, ſlingers, and light-armed infantry, and marching himſelf by land at the head of 60 cohorts, went to attack that part of Cæſar’s lines which was next to the ſea, and not yet quite finiſhed. He ſet out from his camp in the dead of the night, and arriving at the poſt he deſigned to force by break of day, he began the attack by ſea and land at the ſame time. The ninth legion, which defended that part of the lines, made for ſome time a vigorous reſiſtance ; but being attacked in the rear by Pompey’s men, who came by ſea, and landed between Cæſar’s two lines, they fled with ſuch precipitation, that the ſuccours Marcellinus ſent them ſrom a neighbouring poſt could not ſtop them. The enſign who carried the eagle at the head -of the routed legion was mortally wounded ; but nevertheleſs, before he died, had preſence of mind enough to conſign the eagle to the cavalry of the party, deſiring them to deliver it to Cæſar. Pompey’s men purſued the fugitives, and made ſuch a ſlaughter of them, that all the centurions of the firſt cohort were cut off except one. And now Pompey’s army broke in like a torrent upon the poſts Cæſar had fortified, and were advancing to attack Mar-cellinus, who guarded a neighbouring fort ; but Marc Antony coming very ſeaſonably to his relief with 12 cohorts, they thought it adviſable to retire.</p><p>Soon after Cæſar himſelf arrived with a ſtrong reinforcement, and poſted himſelf on the ſhore, in order to prevent ſuch attempts ſor the future. From this poſt he obſerved an old camp which he had made within the place where Pompey was incloſed, but afterwards abandoned. Upon his quitting <hi rend="italic">it,</hi>  Pompey had taken poſſeſſion of it, and left a legion to guard it. This poſt Cæſar reſolved to reduce, hoping to repair the loſs he had ſuſtained on this unfortunate day, by taking the legion which Pompey had poſted there. Accordingly, lie advanced ſecretly at the head of 33 cohorts in two lines : and arriving at the old camp before Pompey could have notice of his march, attacked it with great vigour, forced the firſt intrenchment, notwithſtanding the brave reſiſtance of Titus Pulcio, and penetrated to the ſecond, whither the legion had retired. But here</p><lb/><p>his fortune changed on a ſudden. His right wing, in looking for an entrance into the camp, marched along the outſide of a trench which Cæſar had formerly carried on from the left angle of his camp, about 400 paces, to a neighbouring river. This trench they miſ-toök for the rampart of the camp ; and being led away by that miſtake from their leſt wing, they were ſoon after prevented from rejoining it by the arrival of Pompey, who came up at the head of a legion and a large body of horſe. Then the legion which Cæſar had attacked taking courage, made a briſk ſally, drove his men back to the firſt intrenchment which they had ſeized, and there put them in gιeat diſorder while they were attempting to paſs the ditch. Pompey, in the mean time, falling upon them with his cavalry in flank, completed their defeat ; and then flying to the enemy’s right wing, which had paſſed the trench mentioned above, and was ſhut up between that and the ramparts of the old camp, made a moſt dreadful ſlaughter of them. The trench was filled with dead bodies, many falling into it in that diſorder, and others paſſing over them and preſſing them to death.</p><p>In this diſtreſs, Cæſar did all he could to ſtop the flight of his legionaries, but to no purpoſe: the ſtan-dard-bearers themſelves threw down the Roman eagles when Cæſar endeavoured to ſtop them, and left them in the hands of the enemy, who on this occaſion took 32 ſtandards ; a diſgrace which Cæſar had never ſuffered before. He was himſelf in no ſmall danger of faffing by the hand of one of his own men, whom he took hold of when flying, bidding him ſtand and face about ; but the man, apprehenfιve of the danger he was in, drew his ſword, and would have killed him, had not one of his guards prevented the blow by cutting oſſhifi arm. Cæſar loſt on this occafιon 960 of his foot, 400 of his horſe, 5 tribunes, and 32 centurions.</p><p>This loſs and diſgrace greatly mortified Cæſar, but did not diſcourage him. After he had by his lenity and eloquent ſpeeches recovered the ſpirit of his troops, he decamped, and retired in good order to Apollonia, where he paid the army, and left his ſick and wounded. From thence he marched into Macedon, where Scipio Metellus, Pompey’s father-in-law, was encamped. He hoped either to draw his rival into ſome plain, or to overpower Scipio <hi rend="italic">if</hi>  not aſſiſted. Pie met with great difficulties on his march, the countries through which he paſſed refuſing to ſupply his army with proviſions ; to ſuch a degree was his reputation ſunk ſince his lait defeat ! On his entering Theſſaly he was met by Domitius, one of his lieutenants, whom he had ſent with three legions to reduce Epirus. Having now got all his forces together, he marched directly to Gomphi, the firſt town of Theſſaly, which had been formerly in his intereſt, but now declared againſt him. Whereupon he attacked it with ſo much vigour, that though the garriſon was very numerous, and the waffs were of an uncommon height, he made himſelf maſter of it in a few hours. From hence he matched to Metropolis, another conſiderable town of Theſſaly, which immediately ſurrendered ; as did all the other cities of the country, except Lai iſſa, of which Scipio had made himſelf maſter.</p><p>On the other hand, Pompey being continually importuned by the ſenators and officers of his army, left his camp at Dyrrhachium, anti followed Cæſar, firmly</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
