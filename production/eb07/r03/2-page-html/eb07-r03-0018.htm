<p><span class="font0">any other publication on the subject. When urged to give it to the public, he said dryly, “ The age has so little taste,&nbsp;that the sale would not pay the expense.” Of this work he&nbsp;published an abridgment, to which he subjoined an extract&nbsp;of his prosody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ruddiman next engaged in the management of a newspaper, an employment for which his genius and industry seemed to render him well qualified. But those who should&nbsp;expect either much information or amusement from this&nbsp;publication, would perhaps be greatly disappointed. The&nbsp;newspaper which he conducted was the Caledonian Mercury, and was established in 1720, by William Rolland, a&nbsp;lawyer. Ruddiman acted only for five years in the capacity of printer ; but upon the death of Mr Rolland in 1729,&nbsp;the property was transferred to him, or to his brother Walter and him conjunctly. This paper continued in the family&nbsp;of Ruddiman till the year 1772, when it was sold by the&nbsp;trustees of his grandchildren. The Caledonian Mercury&nbsp;was at first printed three times a week, on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, in a small quarto of four pages, with two&nbsp;columns in each page, and fifty lines in each column ; so&nbsp;that the whole paper contained only four hundred lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mr Ruddiman, after the death of Mr Spottiswoode, librarian, remained for some time in his former station ; but he was at length appointed keeper of the library, though without any increase of salary ; and some years afterwards Mr&nbsp;Goodal, the defender of Queen Mary, succeeded him in the&nbsp;office of sub-librarian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The assiduous application of Ruddiman, supported by such learning, was entitled to wealth, which now indeed&nbsp;flowed upon him in what was at that period deemed great&nbsp;abundance. On the lst of October 1735, it appeared, from&nbsp;an exact statement of his affairs, that he was worth L.1882.&nbsp;5s. 2d. sterling ; and on the 20th of May the ensuing year&nbsp;his wealth had increased to L.1985. 6s. 3d. sterling. In&nbsp;1710 he had valued his effects at L.24. l4s. 9d. sterling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1737 the schoolmasters and teachers in Edinburgh formed themselves into a society, in order to establish a&nbsp;fund for the support of their widows and children. Of this&nbsp;scheme Ruddiman was an active promoter, and was chosen&nbsp;treasurer. Perhaps it was this association which in 1742&nbsp;gave to the Scotch clergy the idea of forming their widows’&nbsp;fund.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1739 he published </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Selectus Diplomatum et Numismatum Scoticæ Thesaurus.</span><span class="font0"> This work was projected and begun by Anderson, and hence called Anderson’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Diplomata, </span><span class="font0">but was finished by Ruddiman. The preface, w<sup>τ</sup>hich is an&nbsp;excellent commentary on Anderson’s performance, was&nbsp;written by Ruddiman, and displays a greater extent of&nbsp;knowledge than any of his other productions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As Ruddiman had imbibed from his father those political principles which attached him to the family of Stuart, he probably did not remain an unconcerned spectator of&nbsp;the civil commotions which, in 1745, agitated Scotland. He&nbsp;did not, however, take any active part in the rebellion. His&nbsp;principles, he has been heard to say, induced him to be a&nbsp;quiet subject and a good citizen. He retired to the country during the summer of 1745; and whilst his fellow-citizens were spilling each other’s blood, he was more happily&nbsp;engaged in writing Critical Observations on Burmann’s&nbsp;Commentaries on Lucan’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Phαrsαlia.</span><span class="font0"> The Caledonian Mercury was in the mean time marked with a jealous eye. His&nbsp;son, who had for some time been the principal manager of&nbsp;that newspaper, having copied from an English paper a paragraph which was reckoned seditious, was imprisoned. The&nbsp;solicitation of his father procured his release ; but it was too&nbsp;late, for the unhappy young man had contracted a distemper in the tolbooth of Edinburgh which brought him to a&nbsp;premature grave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the last seventeen years of his life, Ruddiman was almost incessantly engaged in controversy. To this&nbsp;he was in some measure compelled by the violent attacks&nbsp;which some critics of the times had successively made upon his works. He was first called upon by Benson, auditor&nbsp;in the exchequer, to determine the comparative merit of&nbsp;Buchanan and Johnson as poets. He gave a decided preference to Buchanan in perspicuity, purity, and variety of&nbsp;style ; but, like a candid critic, allowed Johnson to be superior in the harmony of his numbers. His next antagonist was Logan, one of the ministers of Edinburgh, a weak&nbsp;and illiterate man, but an obstinate polemic. The subject of&nbsp;contest was, whether the crown of Scotland was strictly&nbsp;hereditary, and whether the birth of Robert III. was legitimate. Ruddiman maintained the affirmative in both&nbsp;points, and certainly far surpassed his antagonist in the&nbsp;powers of reasoning. He proved the legitimacy of Robert&nbsp;by the public records of the kingdom, with a force of argument which admits of no reply ; but in discussing the first&nbsp;question, by which he was led to consider the contest between Bruce and Baliol, he was not so successful ; for there&nbsp;are many instances in the history of Scotland in which the&nbsp;brother succeeded to the crown in preference to the son.&nbsp;He showed, however, that the Scottish crown was at no&nbsp;period properly elective ; and that, according to the old&nbsp;licentious constitution of the kingdom, the right of Bruce,&nbsp;who was the nearest in blood to the royal stock, was preferable to the claim of Baliol, though descended from the&nbsp;eldest daughter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the labours of Ruddiman did not end when the pen dropt from the feeble hand of Logan. He was soon called&nbsp;upon to repel the attacks of Love, schoolmaster of Dalkeith,&nbsp;who maintained, in opposition to him, that Buchanan had&nbsp;neither repented of his treatment of Queen Mary, nor had&nbsp;been guilty of ingratitude to that princess. That Buchanan&nbsp;ever repented there is reason to doubt. Whether he was&nbsp;guilty of ingratitude, let the unbiassed determine, when&nbsp;they are assured by authentic records that Mary conferred&nbsp;on him a pension for life of five hundred pounds Scotch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When Ruddiman had arrived at his eightieth year, and was almost blind, he was assailed by James Man, master of&nbsp;an hospital at Aberdeen, with a degree of rancour and virulence, united with some learning and ability, which must&nbsp;have touched him in a sensible manner, and alarmed his&nbsp;fears for his reputation after his decease. He was called a&nbsp;finished pedant, a furious calumniator, and a corrupter of&nbsp;Buchanan’s works. The venerable old man again put on&nbsp;his armour, entered the lists, and gained a complete victory. Man, with all his acuteness, could only point out&nbsp;twenty errors in two folio volumes. Some of these were&nbsp;typographical, some trifling, and some doubtful. Ruddiman, with much pleasantry, drew up against Man an account of four hundred and sixty-nine errors, consisting of&nbsp;fourteen articles, of which two or three may be produced as&nbsp;a specimen: 1. Falsehoods and prevarications, twenty; 2.&nbsp;absurdities, sixty-nine ; and, 3. passages from classical authors which were misunderstood by Man, ten. The triumph&nbsp;which he gained over this virulent adversary he did not long&nbsp;enjoy, for he died at Edinburgh on the 19th of January&nbsp;1757, in the eighty-third year of his age, and was buried&nbsp;in the Greyfriars churchyard, without any monument to&nbsp;distinguish his grave. He was three times married, but left&nbsp;behind him only one daughter, Alison, who was married in&nbsp;1747 to Mr James Stewart. He is supposed to have died&nbsp;worth L.3000 sterling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He was of the middle size, of a thin and straight make, and had eyes remarkably piercing. Of his talents and learning his works afford the most satisfactory proofs. His memory w as tenacious and exact ; and he was so great a master in the Latin language that he has perhaps been equalled&nbsp;by none since the days of Buchanan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ruddiman has left a character unstained by vice and distinguished by many virtues. His piety was exemplary</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
