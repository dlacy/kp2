            <p><span class="font1">vour, and greatly honoured by the ſenate. In the Mi-thridatic
                    war, their alliance with Rome brought upon them the king of Pontus with all his
                    force; but having&nbsp;loſt the greateſt part of his fleet before the city, he
                    was&nbsp;obliged to raiſe the ſiege without performing any remarkable exploit.
                    In the war which Pompey made on&nbsp;the Cilician pirates, the Rhodians aſſiſted
                    him with all&nbsp;their naval force, and had a great ſhare in the
                    victories&nbsp;which he gained. In the civil war between Cæſar and&nbsp;Pompey,
                    they aſſiſted the latter with a very numerous&nbsp;fleet. After his death they
                    ſided with Cæſar; which&nbsp;drew upon them the reſentment of C. Caſſius, who
                    advanced to the iſland of Rhodes with a powerful fleet,&nbsp;after having
                    reduced the greateſt part of the continent.&nbsp;The Rhodians, terrified at his
                    approach, ſent ambaſ-ſadors intreating him to make up matters in an
                    amicable&nbsp;manner, and promiſing to ſtand neuter, and recal the&nbsp;ſhips
                    which they had ſent to the aſſiſtance of the triumviri. Caſſius inſiſted upon
                    their delivering up their&nbsp;fleet to him, and putting him in poſſeſſion both
                    of their&nbsp;harbour and city. This demand the Rhodians would&nbsp;by no means
                    comply with, and therefore began to put&nbsp;themſelves in a condition to ſtand
                    a ſiege; but firſt ſent&nbsp;Archelaus, who had taught Caſſius the Greek
                    tongue&nbsp;while he ſtudied at Rhodes, to intercede with his diſ-ciple in their
                    behalf. Archelaus could not, with all his&nbsp;authority, prevail upon him to
                    moderate his demands;&nbsp;wherefore the Rhodians, having created one
                    Alexander,&nbsp;a bold and enterpriſing man, their prætor or
                    prytanis,&nbsp;equipped a fleet of 33 ſail, and ſent it out under
                    the&nbsp;command of Mnaſeus, an experienced ſea-officer, to offer Caſſius
                    battle. Both fleets fought with incredible&nbsp;bravery, and the victory was
                    long doubtful: but the&nbsp;Rhodians, being at length overpowered by
                    numbers,&nbsp;were forced to return with their fleet to Rhodes; two&nbsp;of
                    their ſhips being ſunk, and the reſt very much damaged&nbsp;by the heavy ſhips
                    of the Romans. This was the firſt&nbsp;time, as our author obſerves, that the
                    Rhodians were&nbsp;fairly overcome in a ſea-fight.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">Caſſius, who had beheld this fight from a neighbouring hill,
                    having refitted his fleet, which had been no leſs damaged than that of the
                    Rhodians, repaired to&nbsp;Loryma, a ſtronghold on the continent belonging
                    to&nbsp;the Rhodians. This caſtle he took by aſſault; and from&nbsp;hence
                    conveyed his land-forces, under the conduct of&nbsp;Fannius and Lentulus, over
                    into the iſland. His fleet&nbsp;Conſiſted of 80 ſhips of war and above 203
                    tranſports.&nbsp;The Rhodians no ſooner ſaw this mighty fleet appear,&nbsp;but
                    they went out again to meet the enemy. The ſecond engagement was far more bloody
                    than the firſt;&nbsp;many ſhips were ſunk, and great numbers of men killed on
                    both ſides. But victory anew declared for the&nbsp;Romans; who immediately
                    blocked up the city of&nbsp;Rhodes both by ſea and land. As the Rhodians
                    had&nbsp;not had time to furniſh the city with ſufficient ſtore
                    of&nbsp;proviſions, ſome of the inhabitants, fearing that if it&nbsp;were taken
                    either by aſſault or by famine, Caſſius would&nbsp;put all the inhabitants to
                    the ſword, as Brutus had&nbsp;lately done at Xanthus, privately opened the gate
                    to&nbsp;him, and put him in poſſeſſion of the town, which he&nbsp;nevertheleſs
                    treated as if it had been taken by aſſault.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">He
                    </span><span class="font1">commanded 50 of the chief citizens, who were
                    ſu-ſpected to favour the adverſe party, to be brought before him, and ſentenced
                    them all to die; others, to the&nbsp;n</span><span class="font2">umber of 25,
                    who had commanded the fleet or army</span></p></div><br clear="all"

        <p><span class="font1">becauſe they did not appear when ſummoned, he pro-ſcribed. Having
                thus puniſhed ſuch as had either acted or ſpoken againſt him or his party, he
                commanded the Rhodians to deliver up to him all their ſhips, and&nbsp;whatever money
                they had in the public treaſury. </span><span class="font0">He&nbsp;</span><span
                class="font1">then plundered the temples; ſtripping them of all their&nbsp;valuable
                furniture, veſſels, and ſtatues. He is ſaid not&nbsp;to have left one ſtatue in the
                whole city, except that&nbsp;of the ſun; bragging, at his departure, that he
                had&nbsp;ſtripped the Rhodians of all they had, leaving them nothing but the ſun. As
                to private perſons, he commanded them, under ſevere penalties, to bring to him all
                the&nbsp;gold and ſilver they had, promiſing, by a public crier,&nbsp;a tenth part
                to ſuch as ſhould diſcover any hidden trea-ſures. The Rhodians at firſt concealed
                ſome part of&nbsp;their wealth, imagining that Caſſius intended by this proclamation
                only to terrify them; but when they&nbsp;found he was in earneſt, and ſaw ſeveral
                wealthy citizens put to death for concealing only a ſmall portion&nbsp;of their
                riches, they deſired that the time prefixed for&nbsp;the bringing in their gold and
                ſilver might be prolonged. Caſſius willingly granted them their requeſt;
                and&nbsp;then through fear they dug up what they had hid under ground, and laid at
                his feet all they were worth in&nbsp;the world. By this means he extorted from
                private&nbsp;perſons above 8000 talents. He then fined the city in&nbsp;500 more;
                and leaving L. Varus there with a ſtrong garriſon to exact the fine without any
                abatement, </span><span class="font2">he&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">returned to
                the continent.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">After the death of Caſſius, Marc Antony reſtored the Rhodians to
                their ancient rights and privileges 5-beſtowing upon them the iſlands of Andros,
                Naxos, Tenos, and the city of Myndus. But theſe the Rhodians ſo oppreſſed and loaded
                with taxes, that the ſame Antony, though a great friend to the Rhodian republic, was
                obliged to diveſt her of the ſovereignty over&nbsp;thoſe places, which he had a
                little before ſo liberally&nbsp;beſtowed upon her. From this time to the reign of
                the&nbsp;Emperor Claudius we find no mention made of the&nbsp;Rhodians. That prince,
                as Dion informs us, deprived&nbsp;them of their liberty for having crucified ſome
                Roman citizens. However, he ſoon reſtored them to their former condition, as we read
                in Suetonius and Tacitus.&nbsp;The latter adds, that they had been as often
                deprived&nbsp;of, as reſtored to, their liberty, by way of puniſhment&nbsp;or reward
                for their different behaviour, as they had obliged the Romans with their aſſiſtance
                in foreign wars,&nbsp;or provoked them with their ſeditions at home. Pliny,&nbsp;who
                wrote in the beginning of Veſpaſian’s reign, ſtyles&nbsp;Rhodes a </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">beautiſul and free town.</span><span
                class="font1"> But this liberty they&nbsp;did not long enjoy, the iſland being ſoon
                after reduced&nbsp;by the lame Veſpaſian to a Roman province, and obliged to pay a
                yearly tribute to their new mailers. This&nbsp;province was called the </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">province of the iſlands.</span><span
                class="font1"> The Roman pretor who governed it reſided at Rhodes, as the&nbsp;chief
                city under his juriſdiction; and Rome, notwith-ſtanding the eminemt ſervices
                rendered her by this republic, thenceforth treated the Rhodians not as
                allies,&nbsp;but vaſſals.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The iſland of Rhodes continued ſubject to the Romans till the reign
                of the emperor Andronicus; when Villaret, grand-maſter of the knights of Jeruſalem,
                then&nbsp;reſiding in Cyprus, finding himſelf much expoſed to&nbsp;the attacks of
                the Saracens in that iſland, reſolved to&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">exchange it
                for that of Rhodes. This iſland </span><span class="font1">too was</span></p>
