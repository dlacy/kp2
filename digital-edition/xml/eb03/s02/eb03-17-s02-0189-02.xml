                <p><label>SEA</label>, in a ſtrict ſenſe, ſignifies a large portion of water almoſt
                    ſurrounded by land, as the Baltic and Mediterranean ſeas; but it is frequently
                    uſed for that vaſt body of water which encompaſſes the whole earth.</p>
                <p>What proportion the ſuperficies of the ſea bears to that of the land cannot
                    eaſily be aſcertained. Buffon has ſuppoſed that the ſurface of our globe is
                    equally divided between land and water, and has accordingly calculated the
                    ſuperficies of the ſea to be 85,490,506 ſquare miles. But it is now well known
                    that the ocean covers much more than the half of the earth’s ſurface. Buffon
                    believed the exiſtence of a vaſt ſouthern continent, which Captain Cook has
                    ſhown to be viſionary. It was this circumſtance which miſſed him. According to
                    the moſt accurate obſervations hitherto made, the ſurface of the ſea is to the
                    land as three to one; the ocean therefore extends over 128,235,759 ſquare miles,
                    ſuppoſing the ſuperficies of the whole globe to be 170,981,012 ſquare miles. To
                    aſcertain the depth of the ſea is ſtill more difficult than its ſuperficies,
                    both on account of the numerous experiments which it would be neceſſary to make,
                    and the want of proper inſtruments for that purpoſe. Beyond a certain depth the
                    ſea has hitherto been found unfathomable; and though ſeveral methods have been
                    contrived to obviate this difficulty, none of them has completely anſwered the
                    purpoſe. We know in general that the depth of the ſea increaſes gradually as we
                    leave the ſhore; but if this continued beyond a certain diſtance, the depth in
                    the middle of the ocean would be prodigious. Indeed the numerous iſlands
                    everywhere ſcattered in the ſea demonſtrate the contrary, by ſhowing us that the
                    bottom of the water is unequal like the land, and that ſo far from uniformly
                    ſinking, it ſometimes riſes into lofty mountains. If the depth of the ſea be in
                    proportion to the elevation of the land, as has generally been ſuppoſed, its
                    greateſt depth will not exceed five or ſix miles, for there is no mountain ſix
                    miles perpendicular above the level of the ſea. The ſea has never been actually
                    founded to a greater depth than a mile and 66 feet; every thing beyond that
                    therefore reſts entirely upon conjecture and analogical reaſoning, wſhich ought
                    never to be admitted to determine a ſingle point that can be aſcertained by
                    experiment, becauſe, when admitted, they have too often led to falſe
                    concluſions. Along the coaſts, where the depth of the ſea is in general well
                    known, it has always been found proportioned to the height of the ſhore; when
                    the coaſt is high and mountainous, the ſea that waſhes it is deep; when, on the
                    contrary, the coaſt is low, the water is ſhallow. Whether this analogy holds at
                    a diſtance from the ſhore, experiments alone can determine.</p>
                <p>To calculate the quantity of water contained in the ſea, while its depth is
                    unknown, is impoſſible. But if we ſuppoſe with Buffon that its medium depth is
                    the fourth part of a mile, the ocean, if its ſuperficies be 128,235,759 ſquare
                    miles, will contain 32,058,939.75 cubic miles of water.</p>
                <p>Let us now endeavour to compute the quantity of water which is conſtantly
                    diſcharged into the ſea. For this purpoſe let us take a river whoſe velocity and
                    quantity of water is known, the Po, for inſtance, which according to Riccioli is
                    1000 feet (or 100 perches of Boulogne) broad, 10 feet deep, and runs at the rate
                    of four miles in an hour; eonſequently that river diſcharges into the ſea
                    200,000 cubic perches of water in an hour, or 4,800,000 in a day. A cubic mile
                    contains 125,000,000 cubic perches; the Po therefore will take 26 days to
                    diſcharge a cubic mile of water into the ſea. Let us now ſuppoſe, what is
                    perhaps not very far from the truth, that the quantity of water which the ſea
                    receives from the rivers in any country is proportioned to the extent of that
                    country. The Po from its origin to its mouth traverſes a country 380 miles long,
                    and the rivers which fall into it on every ſide riſe from ſources about ſixty
                    miles diſtant from it. The Po, therefore, and the rivers which it receives,
                    water a country of 45,600 ſquare miles. Now ſince the wſhole ſuperficies of the
                    dry land is about 42,745,253. ſquare miles, it follows, from our ſuppoſition,
                    that the quantity of water diſcharged by all the rivers in the world, in one
                    day, is 36 cubic miles, and in a year 13,140. If therefore the ſea contains
                    32,058,939 cubic miles of water, it would take all the rivers in the world 2439
                    years to diſcharge an equal quantity.</p>
                <p>It may ſeem ſurpriſing that the ſea, ſince it is continually receiving ſuch an
                    immenſe ſupply of water, does not viſibly increaſe, and at laſt cover the whole
                    earth. But our ſurpriſe will ceaſe, if we conſider that the rivers themſelves
                    are ſupplied from the ſea, and that they do nothing more than carry back thoſe
                    waters which the ocean is continually laviſhing upon the earth. Dr Halley, has
                    demonſtrated that the vapours raiſed from the ſea and tranſported upon land are
                    ſufficient to maintain all the rivers in the world. The ſimplicity of this great
                    proceſs is aſtonifhing; the ſea not only connects<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0196.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0190"/> diſtant
                    countries, and renders it eaſy to tranſport the commodities of one nation to
                    another, but its waters riſing in the air deſcend in ſhowers to fertiliſe the
                    earth and nouriſh the vegetable kingdom, and collecting into rivers flow
                    onwards, bringing fertility and wealth and commerce along with them, and again
                    return to the ſea to repeat the fame round.</p>
                <p>The knowledge of this proceſs of nature might, one would think, have convinced
                    philoſophers that the proportion between ſea and land continued always nearly
                    the ſame. Philoſophers however have formed different theories about this as well
                    as moſt other ſubjects, maintaining on the one hand that the ſea is continually
                    encroaching on the land, and on the other that the land is conſtantly gaining on
                    the ſea. Both ſides have ſupported their theories by arguments, demonſtrations,
                    and uncontrovertible facts!</p>
                <p>The height of the mountains, ſay the philoſophers who ſupport the encroachments
                    of the ſea, is continually diminiſhing; expoſed to the violence of every ſtorm,
                    the hardeſt rocks muſt at laſt give way and tumble down. The rivers are
                    continually ſweeping along with them particles of earth which they depoſite in
                    the bottom of the ſea. Both the depth of the ocean then and the height of the
                    dry land muſt be always decreaſing; the waters therefore muſt, unleſs a part of
                    them were annihilated, ſpread over a greater extent of ſurface in proportion as
                    theſe cauſes operate. This reaſoning, convincing as it is, might be confirmed by
                    a great number of facts: it will be sufficient however to mention one or two. In
                    the reign of Auguſtus the iſle of Wight made a part of Britain, ſo that the
                    Engliſh croſſed over to it at low water with cart loads of tin; yet that iſland
                    is at preſent ſeparated from Britain by a channel half a mile wide. The Godwin
                    ſands on the eaſtern ſhore of England were formerly the fertile eſtate of earl
                    Godwin. Nor are the encroachments of the ſea confined to Britain. In the bay of
                    Baiæ near Naples there are remains of houſes and ſtreets ſtill viſible below the
                    preſent level of the ſea. The ſea therefore is making continued encroachments
                    upon the land; and the time will come, ſay they, when the waters will again
                    cover the ſurface of the earth.</p>
                <p>Such are the arguments of thoſe philoſophers who maintain the continual
                    encroachments of the ſea. Thoſe who maintain the oppoſite theory, that the land
                    is gradually gaining on the ſea, though they pretend not to deny the facts
                    advanced by their opponents, affirm that they are altogether inſufficient to
                    eſtabliſh the hypotheſis which they were brought forward to ſupport. Though the
                    rivers carry down particles of earth into the ſea, theſe, ſay they, are either
                    accumulated on other ſhores, or, collecting in the bottom of the ocean, harden
                    into ſtone, which being poſſeſſed of a vegetative power riſes by degrees above
                    the ſurface of the ſea and form rocks, and mountains, and iſlands. The
                    vegetative nature of ſtone indeed is ſufficient, of itſelf, to convince us that
                    the quantity of earth muſt be daily accumulating, arid conſequently that the
                    ſurface of the ſea is diminiſhing in extent. Celſius, a Swediſh philoſopher (for
                    this diſpute has been carried on in Sweden with the greateſt keenneſs), has
                    endeavoured to build this</p>
                <p>theory with more ſolid materials than vegetable ſtone. In a curious memoir,
                    pubiſſhed in 1743, he aſſerts that the Baltic and the Atlantic, at leaſt that
                    part of it which waſhes Norway, is conſtantly diminiſhing; and he proves this by
                    the teſtimony of a great many aged pilots and fiſhermen, who affirmed that the
                    ſea was become much ſhallower in many places than it had been during their
                    youth: that many rocks formerly covered with water were now ſeveral feet above
                    the ſurface of the ſea: that loaded veſſels uſed formerly to ride in many places
                    where pinnaces and barks could now with difficulty ſwim. He produces inſtances
                    of ancient ſea-port towns now ſeveral leagues from the ſhore, and of anchors and
                    wrecks of veſſels found far within the country. He mentions a particular rock
                    which 168 years before was at the bottom of the ſea, but was then raiſed eight
                    feet above its ſurface. In another place where the water 50 years before had
                    reached to the knee there was then none. Several rocks, too, which during the
                    infancy of ſome old pilots had been two feet under water, were then three feet
                    above it. From all theſe obſervations M. Celſius concludes, that the water of
                    the Baltic decreaſes in height 4 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> lines in a year, 4 inches 5 lines in 18 years, 4
                    feet 5 inches in a hundred years, and in a thouſand years 45 feet. Conſcious,
                    however, that theſe facts, how concluſive ſoever as far as relates to the
                    Baltic, can never determine the general queſtion, M. Celſius advances another
                    argument in ſupport of his theory. All that quantity of moiſture, ſays he, which
                    is imbibed by plants is loſt to the general maſs of water, being converted into
                    earth by the putrefaction of vegetables. This notion had been mentioned by
                    Newton, and was adopted by Van Helmont: if granted, it follows as a conſequence
                    that the earth is continually increaſing and the water diminiſhing in a very
                    rapid degree.</p>
                <p>Such are the arguments advanced in ſupport of both theories; for it is needleſs
                    to mention a notion of Linnaeus that the whole earth was formerly covered with
                    water except a ſingle mountain. When fairly weighed, they amount to nothing more
                    than this, that the ſea has encroached upon the land in ſome places, and retired
                    in others; a concluſion which we are very willing to allow. What was advanced by
                    thoſe philoſophers, who maintain that the ſea is continually encroaching on the
                    land, about the depth of the ſea conſtantly diminiſhing, muſt remain a mere
                    aſſertion till they prove by experiments, either that this is really the caſe,
                    or that nature has no way of reſtoring thoſe particles of earth which are waſhed
                    down by the rivers. Nor have they any good reaſon to affirm that the height of
                    the mountains is decreaſing. Can a ſingle uncontrovertible inſtance be produced
                    of this? Are the Alps or the Apennines, or Taurus, or Caucaſus, leſs lofty now
                    than they were a thouſand years ago? We mean not to deny that the rain actually
                    waſhes down particles of earth from the mountains, nor to affirm that the
                    hardeſt rocks are able to refill continual ſtorms, nor that many mountains have
                    ſuffered, and continue to ſuffer daily, from a thouſand accidents. But the
                    effects produced by all theſe cauſes are ſo trifling as to be altogether
                        imperceptible<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                            lower every ten years. But even ac <pb n="191"/> cording to his own
                            calculation, it would require a million of years to level theſe
                            mountains with the plain, though they continued to decreaſe at the ſame
                            rate; and philoſophers tell us that this rate is conſtantly
                            diminiſhing!</p></note>

                    defect. Even ſhould the earth be ſwept away together with its covering, nature
                    has ſtill ſuch reſources left as frequently reſtore things to their former
                    ſtate. Many kinds of moſs, one would be tempted to think, have been created for
                    this very purpoſe: they take root and flouriſh almoſt upon the bare rock, and
                    furniſh as they decay a ſufficient bed for ſeveral of the hardy Alpine plants.
                    Theſe periſh in their turn, and others ſucceed them. The roots of the plants
                    bind fast the earth as it accumulates, more plants ſpring up and ſpread wider,
                    till by degrees the whole ſurface is covered with a firm coat of graſs. Even the
                    rain, which always contains in it a good deal of earth, contributes ſomething to

                    the oppoſite theory, is now, we believe, given up by all parties, it is needleſs
                    to take any farther notice of it here, (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Stone).</hi>
                    The hypotheſis of M. Celſius, that water is converted into earth, has alſo
                    ſhared the ſame fate, becauſe it was unſupported by experiment, and contrary to
                    every thing that we know either about earth or water. It is a little
                    extraordinary that philoſophers have been ſo laviſh of water as to convert it in
                    this manner into ſtone and earth, when they had given it, one would think,
                    ſufficient employment before in making new worlds and in confuting Moſes.</p>
                <p>As the ſea covers ſo great a portion of the globe, we ſhould, no doubt, by
                    exploring its bottom, diſcover a vaſt number of intereſting particulars.
                    Unfortunately in the greater part of the ocean this has hitherto been
                    impoſſible. Part, however, has been examined; and the diſcoveries which this
                    examination has produced may enable us to form ſome idea at leaſt of the whole.
                    The bottom of the ſea, as might have been conjectured indeed beforehand, bears a
                    great reſemblance to the ſurface of the dry land, being, like it, full of
                    plains, rocks, caverns, and mountains; ſome of which are abrupt and almoſt
                    perpendicular, while others riſe with a gentle declivity, and ſometimes tower
                    above the water and form iſlands. Neither do the materials differ which compoſe
                    the bottom of the ſea and the baſis of the dry land. If we dig to a conſiderable
                    depth in any part of the earth, we uniformly meet with rock; the ſame thing
                    holds in the ſea. The ſtrata, too, are of the ſame kind, diſpoſed in the ſame
                    manner, and form indeed but one whole. The ſame kind of mineral and bituminous
                    ſubſtances are alſo found interſperſed with theſe ſtrata; and it is to them
                    probably that the ſea is indebted for its bitter taſte. Over theſe natural and
                    original ſtrata an artificial bed has pretty generally been formed, compoſed of
                    different materials in different places. It conſiſts frequently of muddy
                    tartareous ſubſtances firmly cemented</p>
                <p>together, ſometimes of ſhells or coral reduced to powder, and near the mouths of
                    rivers it is generally compoſed of fine ſand or gravel. The bottom of the ſea
                    reſembles the land likewiſe in another particular: many freſh ſprings and even
                    rivers riſe out of it, which, diſplacing the ſalt water, render the lower part
                    of the ſea wherever they abound quite freſh. An inſtance of this kind occurs
                    near Goa on the weſtern coaſt of Indoſtan<note anchored="true" n="2" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>*</p></note> *, and another<note anchored="true" n="3" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>§</p></note> §
                    in the Mediterranean ſea not far from Marſeilles. Theſe facts occaſioned a
                    notion, which later experiments have exploded, that the ſea beyond a certain
                    depth was always freſh.</p>
                <p>Subſtances of a very beautiful appearance are frequently brought up by the
                    founding line from the bottom of the ſea. The plummet is hollowed below, and
                    this cavity filled with tallow, to which ſome of the ſubſtances adhere which
                    form the bed of the ocean. Theſe are generally ſand, gravel, or mud; but they
                    are ſometimes of the brighteſt ſcarlet, vermilion, purple, and yellow; and
                    ſometimes, though leſs frequently, they are blue, green, or white. Theſe colours
                    are owing to a kind of jelly which envelopes the ſubſtances, and vaniſh entirely
                    as ſoon as this jelly dries. At times, however, they aſſume the appearance of
                    tartareous crufts, and are then ſo permanent, that they can be received into
                    white wax melted and poured round them, and perhaps by proper care might be
                    converted into valuable paints.</p>
                <p>Sea-water is really, as any one may convince himſelf by pouring it into a glaſs,
                    as clear and tranſparent as river water. The various appearances therefore which
                    it affirmes are owing to accidental cauſes, and not to any change in the water
                    itſelf. The depth, or the materials which compoſe the bottom of the ſea,
                    occaſions it to aſſume different colours in different places. The Arabian gulph,
                    for inſtance, is ſaid to be red from the colour of the ſands which form its bed.
                    The appearance of the ſea is affected too by the winds and the ſun, while the
                    clouds that paſs over it communicate all their various and fleeting colours.
                    When the ſun ſhines it is green; when the ſun gleams through a fog it is yellow;
                    near the north pole it appears black; while in the torrid zone its colour is
                    often brown. Sometimes the ſea aſſumes a luminous appearance. Sec <hi

                <p>The ſea contains the greateſt quantity of ſalt in the torrid zone, where
                    otherwiſe from the exceſſive heat it would be in danger of putrefaction: as we
                    advance northward this quantity diminiſhes, till at the pole it nearly vaniſhes
                    altogether. Under the line Lucas found that the ſea contained a ſeventh part of
                    ſolid contents, conſiſting chiefly of ſea-ſalt. At Harwich he found it yielded

                    This deficiency of ſalt near the poles probably contributes a good deal towards

                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0198.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0192"/> for ſalt
                    water requires a much greater degree of cold to freeze it than freſh water. It
                    was this circumſtance, probably, together with its conſtant motion, which
                    induced the ancients to believe that the ſea never froze. Even among the moderns
                    it has been a generally received opinion, that ſea-ice is originally formed in
                    rivers. Buffon has made the great quantities of ice with which the South ſea
                    abounds an argument for the exiſtence of a continent near the Antarctic pole.
                    But it is now well known that great quantities of ice are formed at a diſtance
                    from land. Sea-ice is of two kinds; field ice, which extends along the ſhore,
                    and is only two or three feet thick; and mountain ice, which abounds in the
                    middle of the ocean. The ſize of theſe mountains is ſometimes prodigious. The
                    ſea-ice is always freſh, and has been often of great uſe to navigators. The
                    weight of ſea-water is to that of river-water as 73 to 70; that is, a cubic foot
                    of ſea-water weighs 73 lb. while the ſame quantity of river-water weighs only
                    70lb.; but this proportion varies in different places. It is worthy of our
                    attention, too, that the water at the ſurface of the ſea contains leſs ſalt than
                    near the bottom; the difference indeed is inconſiderable, but ſtill it is
                    ſomething. The Compte de Marſigli found the ſame quantity of water, when taken
                    from the bottom of the Mediterranean, to weigh one ounce three pennyweights 51
                    grains; whereas from the ſurface it weighed only one ounce three pennyweights 49
                    grains. He repeated the experiment frequently with nearly the ſame reſult.</p>
                <p>The ſea, with reſpect to temperature, may be divided into two regions: The firſt
                    begins at the ſurface of the water, and deſcends as far as the influence of the
                    ſun’s rays; the ſecond reaches from thence to the bottom of the ſea<note anchored="false" n="5" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Boyle de
                            Temperie Regionum Submarinarum.</p></note>. In ſummer the lower region
                    is conſiderably colder than the upper: but it is probable that during winter the
                    very reverſe takes place; at leaſt the Compte de Marſigli found it ſo repeatedly
                    in the Mediterranean. This naturally reſults from the ſituation of the water
                    near the bottom of the ſea. Uninfluenced by the changes in the atmoſphere, it
                    retains always nearly the ſame degree of temperature: and this is conſiderably
                    above congelation; for the lower region of the ſea, at leaſt in the temperate
                    parts of the world, was never known to freeze.<note anchored="false" n="6" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Phil. Trans. for 1751, p.

                    the degrees of temperature and ſaltneſs of the ſea at different depths. It
                    deſcended 5346 feet, which is a mile and eleven fathoms. He found the ſea ſalter
                    and colder in proportion to its depth till the gage had deſcended 3900 feet,
                    when the mercury in the thermometer came up at 53; but the water never grew
                    colder, though he let down the gage 2446 feet lower. At the ſurface the
                    thermometer ſtood at 84.</p>
                <p>The ſea has three kinds of motion: 1. The firſt is that undulation which is
                    occaſioned by the wind. This motion is entirely confined to the ſurface; the
                    bottom even during the moſt violent ſtorms remains perfectly calm. Mr Boyle has
                    remarked, from the teſtimony of ſeveral divers, that the ſea is affected by the
                    winds only to the depth of ſix feet. It would follow from this, that the height
                    of the waves above the ſurface does not exceed ſix feet; and that this holds in
                    the Mediterranean at leaſt, we are informed by the Compte de Marſigli, though he
                    alſo ſometimes obſerved them, during a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> violent
                    tempeſt, riſe two feet higher. It is affirmed by Pliny, and ſeveral other
                    ancient writers, that oil calms the waves of the ſea; and that divers were
                    accuſtomed to carry ſome of it for that purpoſe in their mouths. This account
                    was always conſidered by the moderns as a fable, and treated with ſuch contempt,
                    that they did not even deign to put it to the teſt of expeririment, till Dr
                    Franklin accidentally diſcovered its truth. Happening in 1757 to be in the
                    middle of a large fleet, he obſerved that the water round one or two veſſels was
                    quite calm and ſmooth, while everywhere elſe it was very much agitated by the
                    winds. He applied to the captain for an explanation of this phenomenon, who
                    replied, that the cooks, he ſuppoſed, had thrown their greaſy water out at the
                    ſcupper-holes, and by that means oiled the ſides of the veſſels in queſtion.
                    This anſwer did not ſatisfy the Doctor at firſt; but recollecting what Pliny had
                    ſaid on the ſubject, he reſolved at leaſt to try the experiment. He did ſo
                    accordingly in 1762, and found that oil actually calmed the waves of the ſea. He
                    repeated the experiment upon lake Clapham: the oil ſpread itſelf with great
                    rapidity upon the ſurface, but did not produce the deſired effect, becauſe,
                    having been thrown in upon the ſide oppoſite to the wind, it was immediately
                    driven to the edge of the water. But upon throwing in a like quantity upon the
                    other ſide of the lake, it calmed in an inſtant ſeveral yards of the ſurface;
                    and gradually ſpreading, rendered all that part of the lake, to the extent of at
                    leaſt half an acre, as ſmooth as glaſs. The curious effect produced by this
                    liquid may be accounted for by the repulſion which exiſts between oil and water,
                    and between oil and air, which prevents all immediate contact, all rubbing of
                    the one upon the other.</p>
                <p>2. The ſecond kind of motion is that continual tendency which the whole water in
                    the ſea has towards the weſt. It is greater near the equator than about the
                    poles; and indeed cannot be ſaid to take place at all in the northern hemiſphere
                    beyond the tropic. It begins on the weſt ſide of America, where it is moderate:
                    hence that part of the ocean has been called <hi rend="italic">Pacific.</hi> As
                    the waters advance weſtward their motion is accelerated; ſo that, after having
                    traverſed the globe, they ſtrike with great violence on the eaſtern ſhore of
                    America. Being ſtopped by that continent, they turn northward, and run with
                    conſiderable impetuoſity into the gulph of Mexico; from thence they proceed
                    along the coaſt of North America, till they come to the ſouth ſide of the great
                    bank at Newfoundland, when they turn off, and run down through the Weſtern
                    Iſles. This current is called the <hi rend="italic">Gulph Stream.</hi> It was
                    firſt accurately deſcribed by Dr Franklin, who remarked alſo, that the water in
                    it having been originally heated in the torrid zone, cools ſo gradually in its
                    paſſage northward, that even the latitude might be found in any part of the
                    ſtream by means of a thermometer.— This motion of the ſea weſtward has never
                    been explained: it ſeems to have ſome connection with the trade-winds and the
                    diurnal revolution of the earth on its axis.</p>
                <p>3. The third and moſt remarkable motion of the ſea is the tide, which is a
                    regular ſwell of the ocean once every 12 hours, owing, as Newton has
                    demonſtrated, to the attraction of the moon. In the middle of the ſea the tide
                    ſeldom riſes higher than one or two feet, but on the coaſt it frequently reaches
                    the height of 45<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0199.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0193"
                    /> feet, and in ſome places even more. The tide generally riſes higher in the
                    evening than in the morning: on the coaſt of Britain this holds in winter, but
                    in ſummer the morning tides are higheſt. In ſome ſeas it is ſaid that there are
                    no tides. This cannot be owing to their being ſurrounded by land, becauſe there
                    is a tide in the lakes of North America. For an explanation of theſe and other
                    phenomena we refer to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Tide.</hi></p>

                    one of nitrous air) occupied from 0.91 to 0.94. He attempted a ſimilar
                    experiment on the middle of the channel between the Engliſh coaſt and Oſtend;
                    but the motion of the ſhip rendered it impracticable. He found that in rainy and
                    windy weather the ſea-air contained a ſmaller quantity of vital air than when
                    the weather was calm. On the ſea-ſhore at Oſtend it occupied from 94 <hi

                <p>It appears, from theſe experiments, that the air at ſea and cloſe to it is in

                    ſeems to be ſubject to the ſame inconſtancy in its degree of purity with that of
                    the land; ſo that we may now with more confidence ſend our patients, labouring

                    the ſea, which have no marſhes in their neighbourhood. It ſeems alſo probable,
                    that the air will be found in general much purer far from the land than near the

                <p>Dr Damman, an eminent phyſician and profeſſor royal of midwifery at Ghent, told

                    Gentleman’s Magazine for the year 1749, we have the account of a ſeadragon which
                    was ſaid to be taken between Orford and Southwould, on the coaſt of Suffolk, and
                    afterwards carried round the country as a curioſity by the fiſherman who caught
                    it.</p>
                <p>“Its head and tail (ſays the writer) reſemble thoſe of an alligator; it has two
                    large fins, which ſerve it both to ſwim and to fly; and though they were ſo
                    dried that I could not extend them, yet they appear, by the folds, to be ſhaped
                    like thoſe which painters have given to dragons and other winged monſters that
                    ſerve as ſupporters to coats of arms. Its body is covered with impenetrable
                    ſcales; its legs have two joints, and its feet are hoofed like thoſe of an aſs:
                    it has five rows of very white and ſharp teeth in each jaw, and is in length
                    about four feet, though it was longer when alive, it having ſhrunk as it became
                    dry.</p>
                <p>“It was caught in a net with mackerel; and being dragged on ſhore, was knocked
                    down with a ſtretcher or boat-hook. The net being opened, it ſuddenly ſprung up,
                    and flew above 50 yards: the man who firſt ſeized it had ſeveral of his fingers
                    bitten off; and the wound mortifying, he died. It afterwards faſtened on the
                    man’s arm who ſhows it, and lacerated it ſo much, that the muſcles are ſhrunk,
                    and the hand and fingers diſtorted; the wound is not yet healed, and is thought
                    to be incurable. It is ſaid by ſome to have been deſcribed by naturaliſts under

                    properly ſpeaking, belong to the claſs of cryptogamia, and the order of algae;
                    and, according to Bomare, are all comprehended under the genus of fucus. We may
                    alſo add ſeveral ſpecies of the ulva and conferva and the ſargazo. The fuci and
                    marine ulvæ are immerſed in the ſea, are ſeſſile, and without root. The marine
                    confervæ are either ſeſſile or floating. The ſargazo grows beyond ſoundings.</p>
                <p>As ſome ſpecies of the fucus, when dried and preſerved, are extermely beautiful,
                    the curious, and eſpecially thoſe who proſecute the ſtudy of botany, muſt be
                    anxious to know the beſt method of preſerving them, without deſtroying their
                    colour and beauty. The following method is recommended by M. Mauduyt. Take a
                    ſheet of paper, or rather of paſteboard, and cover it with varniſh on both
                    ſides; and having rowed in a boat to the rock where the fucus abounds, plunge
                    your varniſhed paper into the water, and, detaching the fucus, receive it upon
                    the paper. Agitate the paper gently in the water, that the plant may be properly
                    ſpread over it; and lift them up together ſoftly out of the water: then fix down
                    with pins the ſtrong ſtalks, that they may not be diſplaced, and leave the plant
                    lying upon the varniſhed paper to dry in the open air. When it is fully dry, the
                    different parts will retain their poſition, and the plant may be preſerved
                    within the leaves of a book. If you wiſh to free it from the ſlime and ſalt
                    which adheres to it, it may be waſhed gently in freſh water, after being removed
                    from the rock on which it grew.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">SEA-Serpent,</hi> a monſtrous creature, ſaid to inhabit the
                    northern ſeas about Greenland and the coaſts of Norway. The following marvellous
                    account of this monſter is given by Guthrie. “In 1756, one of them was ſhot by a
                    maſter of a ſhip: its head reſembled that of a horſe; the mouth was large and
                    black, as were the eyes, a white mane hanging from its neck: it floated on the
                    ſurface of the water, and held its head at leaſt two feet out of the ſea:
                    between the head and neck were ſeven or eight folds, which were very thick; and
                    the length of this ſnake was more than 100 yards, ſome ſay fathoms. They have a
                    remarkable averſion to the ſmell of caſtor; for which reaſon, ſhip, boat, and
                    bark matters provide themſelves with quantities of that drug, to prevent being
                    overſet, the ſerpent’s olfactory nerves being remarkably exquiſite. The
                    particularities related of this animal would be incredible, were they not
                    atteſted upon oath Egede, a very reputable author, ſays, that on the 6th day of
                    July 1734, a large and frightful ſeamon er raiſed itſelf ſo high out of the
                    water, that its head reached above the main-top-maſt of the ſhip; that it</p>
                <p>had a long ſharp ſnout, broad paws, and ſpouted water like a whale; that the body
                    ſeemed to be covered with ſcales; the ſkin was uneven and wrinkled, and the
                    lower part was formed like a ſnake. The body of this monſter is ſaid to be as
                    thick as a hogſhead; his ſkin is variegated like a tortoiſe ſhell; and his
                    excrement, which floats upon the ſurface of the water, is corroſive.” Not-
                    withſtanding the belief of Guthrie, and the teſtimony which he produces, we
                    cannot help doubting of the exiſtence of the ſea-ſerpent. Its bulk is ſaid to be
                    ſo disproportionate to all the known animals of our globe, that it requires more
                    than ordinary evidence to render <hi rend="italic">it</hi> credible; but the
                    evidence which is offered is ſo very feeble and unſatisfactory, that no man of
                    ſound judgement would think it ſufficient to eſtabliſh the truth of an
                    extraordinary fact.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">SEA-Sickneſs,</hi> a diſorder incident to moſt perſons on their
                    firſt going to ſea, occaſioned by the agitation of the veſſel. In voyages,
                    ſea-ſickneſs, though it continues in general only for the firſt day or two, is
                    extremely haraſſing to ſome people at intervals, eſpecially on any increaſed
                    motion of the veſſel. Sometimes, by long continuance, it cauſes fever, headach,
                    quick pulſe, thirſt, white tongue, and a total deprivation of the retention of
                    the ſtomach; evils which are always difficult to remove, and frequently
                    terminate only with the voyage.</p>
                <p>This indiſpoſition is conſiderably alleviated by a ſmall tea ſpoonful of ether,
                    taken now and then in a glaſs of water, and applying ſome of it to the temples
                    and noſtrils. The ancient writers recommend acid fruits, bread and vegetables
                    ſoaked in vinegar, after the ſtomach has been cleanſed by vomiting; but not to
                    attempt to ſuppreſs the vomiting until that end was obtained. An old remedy for
                    ſea-ſickneſs, and a very common one among ſailors, is a draught or two of ſea
                    water; which, though, a diſguſting medicine at ſuch a time, yet where the firſt
                    paſſages are foul and loaded, generally produces the deſired effect when the

                    increaſe; and therefore the ſaltneſs at this time muſt be greater than at any
                    time heretofore. He further adds, that if, by experiments made in different
                    ages, we could find the different quantity of ſalt which the ſame quantity of
                    water (taken up in the ſame place, and in all other the ſame circumſtances)
                    would afford, it would be eaſy from thence, by rules of proportion, to find the
                    age of the world very nearly, or the time wherein it has been acquiring its
                    preſent ſaltneſs.</p>
                <p>This opinion of Dr Halley is ſo improbable, that it is ſurpriſing ſo acute a
                    philoſopher could have adopted it. That freſh water rivers ſhould in the courſe
                    of many thouſand years produce ſaltneſs in the ſea, is quite incredible. If this
                    were the caſe, every ſea or great body of water which receives rivers muſt be
                    ſalt, and muſt poſſeſs a degree of ſaltneſs in proportion to the quantity of
                    water which the rivers diſcharge. But ſo far is this from being true, that the
                    Palus Meotis and the great lakes in America do not contain ſalt but freſh water.
                    It may indeed be objected, that the quantity of ſalt which the rivers carry
                    along with them and depoſit in the ſea, muſt depend on the nature of the ſoil
                    through which they flow, which may in ſome places contain no ſalc at all: and
                    this may be the reaſon why the great lakes in America and the Palus Meotis are
                    freſh. But to this opinion, which is merely hypothetical, there are
                    inſurmountable objections. It is a curious fact that the ſaltneſs of the ſea is
                    greateſt under the line, and diminiſhes gradually as we advance to the poles: We
                    muſt therefore ſuppoſe, if Dr Halley’s theory be true, that the earth contains
                    more ſalt in the tropical regions than in the temperate zones, and more in the
                    temperate zones than in the frigid; and conſequently that the rivers in theſe
                    different regions contain a quantity of ſalt proportionable to their diſtance
                    from the equator. This, however, muſt firſt be proved by experiment, and cannot
                    be aſſumed as an eſtabliſhed fact. But there is another circumſtance that
                    entirely deſtroys this theory. If we allow that the ſea receives its ſaltneſs
                    from the rivers, it muſt be equally ſalt or nearly ſo in every part of the
                    earth. For, according to a ſimple and well known principle in chemiſtry, <hi
                        rend="italic">when any ſub</hi> ſt <hi rend="italic">ance is diſſolved in
                        water with the aſſiſtance of agitation, at whatever part oſ the water it is
                        introduced, it will be equally diffuſed through the whole liquid.</hi> Now
                    though it were true that a greater quantity of ſalt were introduced into the ſea
                    under the line than towards the poles, from the conſtant agitation occaſioned by
                    the wind and tide, the ſalt muſt ſoon pervade the whole maſs of water. To ſay
                    that the ſuperior degree of heat in the tropical regions may diſſolve a greater
                    quantity of ſalt, will not deſtroy our argument; for it is an eſtabliſhed
                    principle in chemiſtry, that cold water will diſſolve nearly as great a quantity
                    of ſalt as hot water can diſſolve.</p>
                <p>The ſaltneſs of the ſea has alſo been aſcribed to the ſolution of ſubterraneous
                    mines of ſalt which is fuppoſed to abound in the bottom of the ſea and along its
                    ſhores. But this hypotheſis cannot be ſupported.</p>
                <p>If the ſea were conſtantly diſſolving ſalt, it would ſoon become ſaturated; for
                    it cannot be ſaid that it is deprived of any part of its ſalt by evaporation,
                    ſince rainwater is freſh. If the ſea were to become ſaturated, neither fiſhes
                    nor vegetables could live in it. We muſt therefore deſpair of being able to
                    account for the ſaltneſs of the ſea by ſecond cauſes; and muſt ſuppoſe that <hi
                        rend="italic">it</hi> has been ſalt from the creation. It is impoſſible
                    indeed to ſuppoſe that the waters of the ſea were at any period freſh ſince the
                    formation of fiſhes and ſea-plants: for as theſe will not live in water
                    ſaturated with ſalt, neither will they live in water that is freſh; we therefore
                    conclude that the ſaltneſs of the ſea has been nearly the ſame in all ages. This
                    is the ſimpleſt hypotheſis of the three that has been mentioned. It explains
                    beſt the various phenomena, and is involved in feweſt difficulties. We ſhall,
                    however, allow that there may be ſome exceptions; that the ſaltneſs of ſome
                    ſeas, or of particular parts of the ſame ſea, may be increaſed by mines of
                    rock-ſalt diſperſed near its ſhores.</p>
                <p>With regard to the uſe of this ſalt property of ſea- water, it is obſerved, that
                    the ſaltneſs of the ſea preſerves its waters pure and ſweet, which otherwiſe
                    would corrupt and ſtink like a filthy lake, and conſequently that none of the
                    myriads of creatures which now live therein could then have a being. From thence
                    alſo the ſea-water becomes much heavier, and therefore ſhips of greater ſize and
                    quantity may be uſed thereon. Saltwater alſo doth not freeze ſo ſoon as
                    freſh-water, whence the ſeas are more free for navigation. We have a
                    diſſertation, by Dr Ruſſel, concerning the medical uſes of ſea-water in diſeaſes
                    of the glands, amp;c. wherein the author premiſes ſome obſervations upon the
                    nature of ſea- water, conſidered as impregnated with particles of all the bodies

                    ſaturated with their ſeveral effluvia, to enrich it and keep it from
                    putrefaction: whence this fluid is ſuppoſed to contract a ſoapineſs; and the
                    whole collection, being pervaded by the ſulphureous ſteams paſſing through it,
                    to conſtitute what we call <hi rend="italic">ſea-water;</hi> the confeſſed
                    diſtinguiſhing characteriſtics of which are ſaltneſs, bitterneſs, nitroſity, and
                    unctuoſity: whence the author concludes, that it may be juſtly expected to
                    contribute ſignally to the improvement of phyſic. The caſes in which our author
                    informs us we are to expect advantage from ſea-water are, 1. In all recent
                    obſtructions of the glands of the inteſtines and meſentery. 2. All recent
                    obſtructions of the pulmonary glands, and thoſe of the viſcera, which frequently
                    produce conſumptions. 3. All recent glandular ſwellings of the neck, or other
                    parts. 4. Recent tumors of the joints, if they are not ſuppurated, or become
                    ſchirrous or cancerous, and have not carious bones for their cauſe. 5. Recent
                    defluxions upon the glands of the eyelids. 6. All defoedations of the ſkin, from
                    an eryſipelas to a lepra. 7. Diſeaſes of the glands of the noſe, with their
                    uſual companion a thickneſs of the lip. 8. Obſtructions of the kidneys, where
                    there is no inflammation, and the ſtone not large. 9. In recent obſtructions of
                    the liver, this method will be proper, where it prevents conſtipations of the
                    belly, and aſſiſts other medicines directed in icterical caſes. The ſame remedy
                    is ſaid to be of ſignal ſervice in the bronchocele; and is likewiſe recommended

                    ſometimes neceſſary to preſerve ſea-water in caſks for bathing and other
                    purpoſes, it is of importance to know how to keep it from putrefaction. Many
                    experiments were made to determine this point by Mr Henry, and are recorded in
                    the firſt volume of the Memoirs of the Literary and Philoſophical Society of
                    Mancheſter. His firſt experiment we ſhall here preſent to our readers. "To one
                    quart of ſea-water were added two ſcruples of freſh quicklime; to another, half
                    an ounce of common culinary ſalt; and a third was kept as a ſtandard without any
                    addition. The mouths of the bottles being looſely covered with paper, they were
                    expoſed to the action of the ſun in ſome of the hotteſt weather in ſummer. In
                    about a week the ſtandard became very offenſive; and the water, with the
                    additional quantity of ſalt, did not continue ſweet many hours longer; whereas
                    that with lime continued many months without ever exhibiting the leaſt marks of
                    putridity.” When he added a dram more of quicklime, the whole of the magneſia
                    contained in the water was ſeparated; and when a further addition was made, a
                    lime-water was immediately formed. He therefore concluded, that two ſcruples of
                    quicklime are ſufficient to preserve a quart of ſea-water. The proportions,
                    however, may vary a little, according to the ſtrength of the quicklime
                    employed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Freſhening of SEA-Water.</hi> The method of making ſea-water
                    freſh was long a deſideratum in navigation. Many methods have been propoſed for
                    this purpoſe, Mr Appleby publiſhed an account of a proceſs which he had
                    inſtituted in the year 1734. He diſtilled ſea-water Wſth a quantity of <hi
                        rend="italic">lapis infernalis</hi> and calcined bones; but this proceſs was
                    ſoon laid aſide, as it was not only difficult in itſelf, but rendered the water
                    unpalatable. Dr Butler propoſed ſoapleys in place of Mr Appleby’s ingredients;
                    but the water was ſtill liable to the ſame objection. Dr Stephen Hales
                    recommended powdered chalk; but his method was expenſive, and did not improve
                    the taſte of the water. Dr Lind of Portſmouth diſtilled ſea-water without any
                    ingredients; but as the experiment he made was performed in a veſſel containing
                    only two quarts, with a glaſs receiver in his ſtudy, nothing concluſive can be
                    drawn from it for the uſe of ſailors. At length Dr Irving brought the proceſs to
                    a very high degree of ſimplicity and perfection, by which the water is obtained
                    pure, without much expence of fuel or a complicated apparatus. For this valuable
                    diſcovery he received a reward of L.5000. The advantages of his method remain to
                    be ſtated, which may be reduced to the following: 1.The aboliſhing all ſtills,
                    ſtill-heads, worm-pipes, and their tubes, which occupy ſo much ſpace as to
                    render them totally incompatible with the neceſſary buſineſs of the ſhip; and
                    uſing in the room of theſe the ſhip’s kettle or boiler, to the top whereof may
                    occaſionally be applied a ſimple tube, which can be eaſily made on board a
                    veſſel at ſea, of iron plate, ſtove funnel, or tin ſheet; ſo that no ſituation
                    can prevent a ſhip from being completely ſupplied with the means of diſtilling
                    ſea-water. 2. In conſequence of the principles of diſtillation being fully
                    aſcertained, the contrivanee of the ſimpleſt means</p>
                <p>of obtaining the greateſt quantity of diſtilled water, by making the tube
                    ſufficiently large to receive the whole column of vapour, and placing it nearly
                    in a horizontal direction, to prevent any compreſſion of the fluid, which takes
                    place ſo much with the common worm. 3. The adopting of the ſimpleſt and moſt
                    efficacious means of condenſing vapour; for nothing more is required in the
                    diſtillation but keeping the ſurface of the tube always wet, which is done by
                    having ſome ſea-water at hand, and a perſon to dip a mop or ſwab into this
                    water, and paſs it along the upper ſurface of the tube. By this operation the
                    vapour contained in the tube will be entirely condenſed with the greateſt
                    rapidity imaginable; for by the application of the wet mop thin ſheets of water
                    are uniformly ſpread, and mechanically preſſed upon the ſurface of the hot tube;
                    which being converted into vapour make way for a ſucceſſion of freſh ſheets; and
                    thus, both by the evaporation and cloſe contact of the cold water conſtantly
                    repeated, the heat is carried off more effectually than by any other method yet
                    known. 4. The carrying on the diſtillation without any addition, a correct
                    chemical analyſis of ſea-water having evinced the futility of mixing ingredients
                    with it, either to prevent an acid from riſing with the vapour, or to deſtroy
                    any bituminous oil ſuppoſed to exiſt in ſea-water, and to contaminate the
                    diſtilled water, giving it that fiery unpalatable taſte inſeparable from the
                    former proceſſes. 5. The aſcertaining the proper quantity of ſea water that
                    ought to be diſtilled, whereby the freſh water is prevented from contracting a
                    noxious impregnation of metallic ſalts, and the veſſel from being corroded and
                    otherwiſe damaged by the ſalts caking on the bottom of it. 6. The producing a
                    quantity of ſweet and wholeſome water, perfectly agreeable to the taſte, and
                    ſufficient for all the purpoſes of ſhipping. 7. The taking advantage of the
                    dreſſing the ſhip’s proviſions, ſo as to diſtil a very conſiderable quantity of
                    water from the vapour, which would otherwiſe be loſt, without any addition of
                    fuel. To ſum up the merits of this method in a few words: The uſe of a ſimple
                    tube, of the moſt eaſy conſtruction, applicable to any ſhip’s kettle. The
                    rejecting all ingredients; aſcertaining the proportion of water to be diſtilled,
                    with every advantage of quality, ſaving of fuel, and preſervation of boilers.
                    The obtaining freſh water, wholeſome, palatable, and in ſufficient quantities.
                    Taking advantage of the vapour which aſcends in the kettle while the ſhip’s
                    proviſions are boiling. All theſe advantages are obtained by the above-mentioned
                    ſimple addition to the common ſhip’s kettles. But Dr Irving propoſes to
                    introduce two ſurther improvements. The firſt is a hearth, or ſtove, ſo
                    conſtructed that the fire which is kept up the whole day for the common
                    buſineſs, of the ſhip ſerves likewiſe for diſtillation; whereby a ſufficient
                    quantity of water for all the economical purpoſes of the ſhip may be obtained,
                    with a very inconſiderable addition to the expence of fuel. The other
                    improvement is that of ſubſtituting, even in the largeſt ſhips, caſt-iron
                    boilers, of a new conſtruction, in the place of coppers.</p>
                <p>As ſoon as ſea-water is put into the boiler, the tube is to be fitted either into
                    the top or lid, round which, if neceſſary, a bit of wet linen may be applied, to
                    make it fit cloſe to the mouth of the veſſel; there will be no oceaſion for
                    luting, as the tube acts like a funnel in car-<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0203.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0197"/> rying off the
                    vapour. When the water begins to boil, the vapour ſhould be allowed to paſs
                    freely for a minute, which will effectually clean the tube and upper part of the
                    boiler. The tube is afterwards to be kept conſtantly wet, by paſſing a mop or
                    ſwab, dipped in ſea water, along its upper ſurface. The waſte water running from
                    the mop may be carried off by means of a board made like a ſpout, and placed
                    beneath the tube. The diſtillation may be continued till three-fourths of the
                    water be drawn off, and no further. This may be aſcertained either by a
                    gauge-rod put into the boiler, or by meaſuring the water diſtilled. The brine is
                    then to be let out. Water may be diſtilled in the ſame manner while the
                    proviſions are boiling. When the tube is made on ſhore, the beſt ſubſtance for
                    the purpoſe is thin copper well tinned, this being more durable in long voyages
                    than tin-plates. Inſtead of mopping, the tube, if required, may have a caſe made
                    alſo of copper, ſo much larger in diameter as to admit a thin ſheet of water to
                    circulate between them by means of a ſpiral copper thread, with a pipe of an
                    inch diameter at each end of the caſe; the lower for receiving cold water, and
                    the upper for carrying it off when heated.</p>
                <p>When only a very ſmall portion of room can be conveniently allowed for
                    diſtillation, the machine (n⁰ 2.), which is only 27 inches long, may be
                    ſubſtituted, as was done in this voyage. The principal intention of this
                    machine, however, is to diſtil rum and other liquors; for which purpoſe it has
                    been employed with extraordinary ſucceſs, in preventing an <hi rend="italic"
                        >empyreuma,</hi> or ſiery taſte.</p>
                <p>Figure I. repreſents in perſpective a ſection of the two boilers taken out of the
                    frame. In the back part at D, E, are ſeen openings for the cocks. On the top is
                    a diſtilling tube A, B, C, five inches diameter at A, and decreaſing in ſize to
                    three inches at C; the length from B to C is five feet. Near C is a ring to
                    prevent the water which is applied to the ſurface from mixing with the diſtilled
                    water. In the inſide of the tube, below B, is a ſmall lip or ledging, to hinder
                    the diſtilled water from returning into the boiler by the rolling qf the
                    ſhip.</p>
                <p>In figure 2. A, B, C, D, repreſent a vertical ſection of a copper box, 27 inches
                    long, ſeven inches wide, and 11 in height, tinned on the inſide. In the bottom F
                    is an aperture about ſix inches in diameter, having a ring to fit on the ſtill
                    or boiler. The dotted lines which run nearly horizontal, are veſſels of thin
                    copper, tinned on the outſide, two feet long, ſeven inches wide, and three
                    quarters of an inch deep. At G is a funnel to receive cold water, which is
                    conveyed into the veſſls by communicating pipes, contrived in ſuch a manner as
                    to form a complete and quick circulation of the water through their whole
                    extent. When the water is become hot by the action of the ſteam, it is
                    diſcharged by the horizontal pipe at A. E is a pipe from which the diſtilled
                    water or ſpirits run, and is bent in ſuch a form that the liquor running from it
                    acts as a valve, and hinders any ſteam from eſcaping that way. On the top of the
                    box, at H, is a ſafety- valve, which prevents any danger from a great
                    accumulation of vapour not condenſed for want of a proper ſupply of cold
                    water.</p>
                <p>We ſhall now mention a different method, diſcovered by the Chevalier Lorgna, by
                    congelation of ſea-water. Sea water requires a very great degree of cold in
                    order to become ice, Our author found that a freezing mixture, made by mixing
                    three parts of pounded ice with two parts of common ſalt, was quite ſuſſicient
                    to freeze it. The cold produced by this mixture is equal to about 4⁰ below
                    nought of Fahrenheit’s thermometer.</p>
                <p>A quantity of ſea-water is never entirely congealed, a portion of it always
                    remaining fluid; and, what is very remarkable, this fluid part is incomparably
                    more full of ſalt and more nauſeous than the reſt: hence, if this be ſeparated
                    from the congealed part, the latter on being melted will be found to contain
                    much leſs ſalt than it did before congelation. This we ſhall call <hi
                        rend="italic">the water of the first purification.</hi></p>
                <p>If the water of the firſt purification be again congealed, a part of it will
                    remain fluid as in the firſt operation. This fluid portion will contain a
                    greater proportion of ſalt than the reſt, which is of courſe more pure, and,
                    being melted, forms the water of the ſecond purification. Thus, by repeatedly
                    freezing the ſame ſea-wa- ter, and ſeparating the fluid from the congealed part
                    in every operation, it is at laſt perfectly purified, lo as to be entirely
                    diveſted of ſalt, and as fit for drink and other purpoſes as the pureſt water
                    that is uſed.</p>
                <p>At firſt the ſea-water, in order to be congealed, requires a very great degree of
                    cold, as mentioned above, the ice formed in it conſiſts rather of ſcales or
                    filaments than of a compact body, and the quantity of the fluid parts bears a
                    conſiderable proportion to the quantity of ice. But as the water, by undergoing
                    the ſucceſſive congelations, becomes more and more pure, ſo it becomes capable
                    of being congealed by a ſmaller and ſmaller degree of cold; the ice is at the
                    ſame time more compact, and in greater quantity; the fluid part at lall becoming
                    very inconſiderable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">SEA-Weed,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Alga Marina,</hi> is
                    commonly uſed as a manure on the ſea-coaſt, where it can be procured in
                    abundance. The beſt fort grows on rocks, and is that from which kelp is made.
                    The next to this is called the <hi rend="italic">peaſy sea-weed:</hi> and the
                    worſt is that with a long ſtalk. In the neighbourhood of Berwick, the farmers
                    mix it with liable-dung and earth, and thus obtain a great quantity of excellent
                    manure. Sea-weed is found alſo to be a very fit manure for gardens, as it not
                    only enriches them, but deſtroys the vermin by which they are uſually
                    infeſted.</p>
