These romances, entitled <hi rend="italic">Sir Gawain,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Sir Gologras,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Sir Ga-lerαη of Galloway,</hi>  have all the appearance of being original compositions, and display considerable poetical effort. But the uncouth use of words dragged inforthe sakeof alliteration, and used in secondary and oblique meanings, renders them extremely harsh in construction, as well asobscure in meaning.</p><p>In England it would seem that the difficulties pointed out by De Brunne, early threw out of fashion this ornate kind of composition ; and the English minstrels had no readier resource than translating from the French, who supplied their language at the same time with tlle phrases of chivalry which did not exist in English. These compositions presented many facilities to tile minstrel. He could, if possessed of the slightest invention, add to them at pleasure, and they might as easily be abridged when memory failed, or occasion required. Accordingly, translations from the French fill up the list of English romance. They are generally written in short lines rhyming together; though often, by way of variety, the third and sixth lines are made to rhyme together, and the poem is thus divided into stanzas of three couplets each. In almost all of these legends, reference is made to “ the romance,” that is, some composition in the French language, as to the original authority. Nay, which is very singular, tales where the subjects appear to be of English growth, seem to have yet existed in French ere they were translated into the language of the country to which the heroes belonged. This seems to have been the case with <hi rend="italic">Hornchild,</hi>  with <hi rend="italic">Guy of Warwick,</hi>  with <hi rend="italic">Revis of Hampton,</hi>  all of which appear to belong originally to England ; yet are their earliest histories found in the French language, or at least the vernacular versions refer to such for their authority. Even the romance of <hi rend="italic">Richard,</hi>  England’s own Cœur de Lion, has perpetual references to the French original from which it was translated. It must naturally be supposed that these translations were inferior to the originals ; and whether it was owing to this cause, or that the composition of these rhymes was attended with too much facility, and so fell into the hands of very inferior composers, it is certain, and is proved by the highest authority, that of Chaucer himself, that even in his time these rhyming romances had fallen into great contempt. TheΛtwιe <hi rend="italic">of Sir Thopas,</hi>  which that poet introduces as a parody, undoubtedly, ofthe rhythmical romances of theage, is interrupted by mine host Harry Bailly, with the strongest and most energetic expressions of total and absolute contempt. But though the minstrels were censured by De Brunne, for lack of skill and memory, and the poems which they recited were branded as “ drafty rhymings,” by the far more formidable censure of Chaucer, their acceptation with the public in general must have been favourable, since, besides many unpublished volumes, the two publications of Ritson and Weber bear evidence of their popularity. Some original compositions doubtless occur among so many translations, but they are not numeroes, and few have been preserved. The poem of <hi rend="italic">Sir Eger</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Sir Grerne,</hi>  which seems of Scottish origin, has no French original ; nor has any been discovered either of the <hi rend="italic">Squire of Low Degree, Sir Eglarnour, Sir Plein-damour,</hi>  or some others. But the French derivation of the two last names renders it probable that such may exist.</p><p>The minstrels and their compositions seem to have fallen</p><p>into utter contempt about the time of Henry VIII. There is a piteous picture of their condition in the person of Richard Sheale, which it is impossible to read without compassion, if we consider that he was the preserver at least, if not the author of the celebrated heroic ballad of <hi rend="italic">Chevy Chace, </hi>at which Sir Philip Sidney’s heart was wont to beat as at the sound of a trumpet. This luckless minstrel had been robbed on Dunsmore Heath, and, shame to tell, he was unable to persuade the public that a son of the Muses had ever been possessed of the sixty pounds which he averred he had lost on the occasion. The account he gives of the effect upon his spirits is melancholy, and yet ridiculous enough.</p><p>After my robbery my memory was so decayde,</p><p>That I colde neather syng, nor talke, my wytts wer so dismayde, My audacitie was gone, and all my myrry tawk :</p><p>Ther ys sum heare have sene me as myrry as a lιawke ;</p><p>But nowe I am so trublyde with phansis in my mynde,</p><p>That 1 cannot play the myrry knave, accordyng to my kynd.</p><p>Yet to tak thought, I perseve, ys not the next waye To bring me out of det, my creditors to paye·</p><p>I may well say that I hade but well hape,</p><p>For to lose about threscore pounde at a clape.</p><p>The losse of my mony did not greve me so sore,</p><p>But the talke of the pyple dyde greve me moch mor.</p><p>Sum sayde I was not robde, I was but a lyeng knave,</p><p>Yt was not possyble for a mynstrell so much mony to have.</p><p>In dede, to say the truthe, that ys ryght well knowenc,</p><p>That I never had so mochc mony of myn owene,</p><p>But I had frendds in London, whos namys I can declare,</p><p>That at all tyms wold lende me cc.lds. worth of ware,</p><p>And sum agayn such frendship I founde,</p><p>That thei wold lend me in mony nyn or tene pownde.</p><p>Tbe occasion why I cum in dete I shall make relacion,</p><p>My wyff in dede ys a sylk woman be her occupacion,</p><p>And lynen cloths most chefly was her greatyste trayd,</p><p>And at faris and merkytts she solde sale-ware that she made ;</p><p>As shertts, smockys, partlytts, hede clothes, and other thinggs,</p><p>As sylk thredd, and eggyngs, skirrts, bandds, and strings.</p><p>From <hi rend="italic">The Chant</hi>  of Richard Sheale, <hi rend="italic">British Bibliographer,</hi>  No. xiii. p. 101.</p><p>Elsewhere, Sheale hints that he had trusted to his harp, and to the well known poverty attached to those who used that instrument, to bear him safe through Dunsmore Heath. At length the order of English minstrels was formally put down by the act 39th of Queen Elizabeth, classing them with sturdy beggars and vagabonds ; in which disgraceful fellowship they only existed in the capacity of fiddlers, who accompanied their instrument with their voice. Such a character is introduced in the play of <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Thomas, </hi>as the “ poor fiddler who says his songs.” The metrical romances which they recited also fell into disrepute, though some of the more popular, sadly abridged and adulterated, continued to be published in <hi rend="italic">chap, books,</hi>  as they are called. About fifty or sixty years since, a person acquired the nickname of <hi rend="italic">Rosewal and Lilian,</hi>  from singing that romance about the streets of Edinburgh, which is probably tiιe very last instance of the proper minstrel craft.</p><p>If the metrical romances of England can boast of few original compositions, they can show yet fewer examples of the prose romance. Sir Thomas Malory, indeed, compiled, from various French authorities, his celebrated <hi rend="italic">Morte dArthur,</hi>  indisputably the best prose romance the language can boast. There is also <hi rend="italic">Arthur of Little Britain;</hi>  and the Lord Berners compiled the romance of the <hi rend="italic">Knight of the Swan.</hi>  The books of Amadis were likewise translated into English ; but it may be doubted whether the country in general ever took that deep interest in the perusal of these records of love and honour with which they were greeted in France. Their number was fewer ; and the attention paid to them in a country where great political questions began to be agitated, w<hi rend="sup">τ</hi>as much less than when the feudal system still continued in its full vigour.</p><p>III.
