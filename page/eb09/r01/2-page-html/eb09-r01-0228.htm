<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of the “ polar disk ” alone exhibiting a vertical striation, and differentiating into two layers, superficial and subjacent (termed&nbsp;achromophilous and cliromophilous respectively). The subjacent&nbsp;vitellus is distinguished into several layers, (central, intermediate,&nbsp;and cortical), and contains yolk elements of three distinct kinds,&nbsp;while the enveloping protoplasm has a distinctly reticulated and&nbsp;!fibrillar structure, like the stroma of so many animal and vegetable&nbsp;cells. The germinal vesicle is practically homogeneous save that&nbsp;the portion surrounding its eccentric germinal spot is distinguished&nbsp;into an investing portion or spherical envelope, the “ prothyalo-soma,” and an “accessory portion,” which usually contains one or&nbsp;two “pseudo-nucleoli.” In the ripe egg Van Beneden describes&nbsp;new complexities within the germinal spot; this consists of&nbsp;two juxtaposed quadrilateral disks, each containing four chromatin&nbsp;globules, united by a substance having less affinity for colouring&nbsp;matter. lfadiating from these two disks, achromatin threads&nbsp;arise in the prothyalosoma, but stress is laid on the fact that no&nbsp;grouping of the chromatin elements into a stardike figure takes&nbsp;place. The spherical shape of the germinal spot is now modified&nbsp;by the intrusion on each side of a large homogeneous droplet from&nbsp;the vitellus into the prothyalosoma, so that in optical section it&nbsp;comes to have a T-shape, the accessory portion being mainly&nbsp;compressed to form the stalk of the T. At this stage the&nbsp;spermatozoon usually commences to work its way into the ovum,&nbsp;but does not yet affect the germinal vesicle or germinal spot, which&nbsp;proceed to the formation of polar globules. The T-shaped gradually&nbsp;passes into the “ ypsiliform ” figure, so called from its resemblance&nbsp;to the Greek </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">T. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Its steadily diverging branches, which are formed&nbsp;from the prothyalosoma, move upwards till they reach the surface&nbsp;of the vitellus, their fibrillar structure already noted meanwhile&nbsp;becoming well marked. Each bundle bears one of the two groups&nbsp;of four chromatin globules which compose the germinal spot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Next the vertical branch of the ypsiliform figure swings upwards to the surface, and a new branch is formed as a continuation of&nbsp;the same line ; the whole figure is thus cross-shaped, with the&nbsp;prothyalosoma in the centre, but this cross soon disappears, leaving&nbsp;the prothyalosoma with its two chromatin groups. These are&nbsp;now divided, by a plane tangential to the surface of the vitellus,&nbsp;into two equal parts, and the upper of these, containing of course&nbsp;half the prothyalosoma with half of each of the two chromatin&nbsp;disks, becomes the first polar globule. Yan Beneden lays great&nbsp;stress on the fact that this plane of division is not transverse to&nbsp;the oblique spindle formed by the diverging branches of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">T, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">as&nbsp;was to be expected from the views of all previous observers, but on&nbsp;the contrary is parallel to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The remaining portion of the prothyalosoma with its two chromatin disks, together with the surrounding protoplasm, now&nbsp;proceeds to the separation of the second polar vesicle. Despite&nbsp;differences in detail, the essential facts are the same : a spindle&nbsp;with a star-like figure at each end is formed; this at first lies radially&nbsp;in the vitellus, but afterwards becomes superficial, and its division&nbsp;takes place as before by an axial not an equatorial plane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A still later and also elaborate discussion is due to Sabatier (1884). While combating the peculiar views suggested by</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Weismann and others as to the polar globules of Insects (as that they re-enter the ovum to form the rudiments of the future reproductive organs), he admits that they may be emitted at both poles&nbsp;of the ovum, and may either break up, be reabsorbed, or even in&nbsp;some cases form peculiar structures surrounding the ovum </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(e. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g.,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the&nbsp;follicular cells of Ascidians). He describes in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Buccinum,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">&amp;c., the&nbsp;extrusion of somewhat amoeboid masses of&nbsp;clear protoplasm at several distinct points&nbsp;and frequently without the appearance of&nbsp;any nuclear spindle ; and these may even repeatedly divide. He holds that the centrifugal extrusion of elements from ova is much&nbsp;more general than is usually recognized, and&nbsp;distinguishes these into three kinds :—(1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“globules précoces,” which usually go to form the elements of the follicle ; (2) “globules tardifs,” which appear later; and (3)&nbsp;true polar vesicles, which alone are associated with karyokinetic&nbsp;changes of the nucleus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Like Yan Beneden, he notes that polar vesicle formation is not strictly comparable to ordinary cell-division in being not transverse but longitudinal to the nuclear spindle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">From this point little advance has been made, though careful reviews of the subject are due to Flemming, J. T. Cunningham, and&nbsp;others. (13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fertilization or Impregnation of the Ovum</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">.—The fundamental generalization now so familiar—that the process of fertilization for plant and animal alike lies in the material&nbsp;union of both sexual products—although said to have&nbsp;been propounded by Alcmæon (580 B.c.), and even described&nbsp;by Hartsoeker (1750), is pointed out by Hensen to be&nbsp;essentially due in the first place to the experimental researches on plant hybridization of Kolreuter (1761). Jacobi&nbsp;soon afterwards artificially fertilized the eggs of Trout and&nbsp;Salmon, but the most important and really convincing&nbsp;work was that of Spallanzani (1780), who experimented on&nbsp;the Frog, Tortoise, and Bitch. He unfortunately, however,&nbsp;concluded that spermatozoa might be absent without preventing fertilization, and ascribed all fertilizing powers to&nbsp;their fluid medium, so establishing an error which required&nbsp;for its elimination many successive researches. Prévost&nbsp;and Dumas (1824) showed that filtration really deprived&nbsp;the seminal fluid of its powers. Martin Barry (1843)&nbsp;actually observed spermatozoa within the zona pellucida&nbsp;of the Rabbit’s ovum ; Leuckart (1849) repeated both preceding observations in the Frog; Nelson (1852) observed&nbsp;the entrance of the spermatozoa into the ovum of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ascaris</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> ; while Keber (1853) discovered the micropyle in&nbsp;the ovum of the Mussel, and watched the passage of the&nbsp;spermatozoon through it into the yolk. It only remained&nbsp;for these results to be confirmed by the high authority of&nbsp;Bischoff and Allen Thomson (1854); and the knowledge&nbsp;of the subject thus reached its second stage, where it&nbsp;practically remained for nearly twenty years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Aided by the advance of histological technique, a new plane was reached (1875-76) by the brilliant researches&nbsp;of Yan Beneden on the ovum of the Rabbit, and of O.&nbsp;Hertwig and Fol on Echinoderm ova. The spermatozoon@@<sup>1</sup> was thus shown not to disappear into the yolk, but&nbsp;to form from its head or nucleus the “ male pronucleus,”&nbsp;which meets and fuses with the “ female pronucleus,” as&nbsp;the germinal vesicle is termed, after the extrusion of the&nbsp;polar body, This new “ conjugation-nucleus ” soon exhibits karyokinetic changes and divides, and the segmentation of the ovum rapidly progresses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">As a full account of these and other papers up to 1880 is given by Balfour (</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Embryology</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, vol. i. ), it will suffice to note the more&nbsp;important subsequent researches, especially as those, though with</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> That, though more than one spermatozoon may pass through the vitelline membrane, only one normally enters the vitellus and becomes&nbsp;a male pronucleus has been well made out by Hertwig, Fol, and&nbsp;others. In the rare cases where more spermatozoa than one force&nbsp;an entrance, Fol has observed the monstrous double segmentation of&nbsp;the ovum, and argues forcibly for the hypothesis that we have to&nbsp;look in this process of “ polyspermy ” for the explanation of numerous teratological and pathological changes.</span></p>
