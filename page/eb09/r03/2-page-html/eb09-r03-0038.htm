The last writer who combines genius&nbsp;with something of national spirit is the poet Claudian,&nbsp;who wrote his epics under the immediate inspiring influence of a great national crisis and a national hero. As&nbsp;fresh blood came to the nearly exhausted literary genius&nbsp;of Italy from Spain in the first century of the empire, so&nbsp;in the later centuries it came from Africa. Whatever&nbsp;of original literary force appears either in the pagan or&nbsp;Christian literature written in the Latin language between&nbsp;the 2d and the 6th century is due to Romanized settlements in Africa. We have to remember during all these&nbsp;comparatively barren centuries that secular literature had</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ROMANS, a town of France, in the department of Drôme, 12 miles north-east of Valence by the railway connecting this town with Grenoble, stands at the foot of an&nbsp;eminence on the right bank of the Isère, 530 feet above&nbsp;the sea. A fine stone bridge unites it with Bourg du&nbsp;Péage on the other side of the river. Both towns owe&nbsp;their prosperity to their situation in the most fertile part&nbsp;of the valley of the Isère, where land is sometimes sold at&nbsp;¿£200 per acre. The population of Romans was 11,916&nbsp;(13,806 in the commune) in 1881. The present parish&nbsp;church belonged to an abbey founded in 837 by St&nbsp;Bernard, forty-ninth bishop of Vienne. The north portal,&nbsp;now condemned, dates from the lltli century; the principal portal is one of the finest specimens of 12th-century&nbsp;Romanesque; and the choir and the transept are striking&nbsp;examples of the style of the 13th. Romans has also a&nbsp;wealthy hospital and a large seminary. Besides the silk-trade the local industries comprise shoemaking, tanning,&nbsp;liat-making, oil-refining, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ROMANS, </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Epistle to the.</span><span class="font3"> The origin of the Christian community at Rome is involved in obscurity. According to Catholic tradition it was founded by Peter, who was its bishop for a quarter of a century. But neither allegation has historical support. The most striking proof of&nbsp;the contrary is precisely this epistle of Paul. It does not&nbsp;contain the remotest reference to either the one fact or&nbsp;the other. And if Paul had written such an epistle to a&nbsp;community founded by Peter he would not only have violated the agreement mentioned in Gal. ii. 9, but would also&nbsp;have gone against his own principle of refraining from&nbsp;intrusion on the mission fields of others (Rom. xv. 20 ;&nbsp;2 Cor. x. 16). But neither was Paul the founder of the&nbsp;church in Rome. This also is shown by the present&nbsp;epistle, in which he for the first time opens relations with&nbsp;a community already formed. Thus we are thrown upon&nbsp;mere conjecture. In pursuing the investigation we have&nbsp;this fact to start from, that even before the Christian era&nbsp;there already existed in Rome a strong Jewish colony.&nbsp;After the conquest of Jerusalem by Pompey (63 </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.)&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">numbers of Jewish prisoners of war were brought to Rome&nbsp;and there sold as slaves. Of these many were soon afterwards emancipated by their masters, Jewish slaves being&nbsp;a peculiarly inconvenient kind of property on account of&nbsp;the strictness of their observance of their law, especially in&nbsp;the matter of clean and unclean meats (Philo, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Leg. ad&nbsp;Caium,</span><span class="font3"> ii. 568, ed. Mangey). These freedinen became the&nbsp;nucleus of a Jewish community, which ultimately settled&nbsp;in Trastevere and organized itself into an independent&nbsp;religious communion. It rapidly increased and became&nbsp;an important element in the life of the capital. By the&nbsp;time of Herod’s death (4 </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.)</span><span class="font3"> the independent Jews of&nbsp;Rome—that is, besides women and children—already&nbsp;numbered 8000 according to Josephus </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Antiq.,</span><span class="font3"> xvii. 11, 1 ;&nbsp;.5Æ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jud.,</span><span class="font3"> ii. 6, 1). In the reign of Tiberius indeed this&nbsp;large and powerful organization was dissolved at a single&nbsp;again found its organ in the Greek language, and that&nbsp;the new spiritual life of the world had come into stern&nbsp;antagonism with many of the most powerful motives of&nbsp;classical poetry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Literature.—</span><span class="font2"> The most important books on the subject are the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Geschichte der römischen Litteratur,</span><span class="font2"> by J. C. F. Bähr ; the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Grundriss der römischen Litteratur,</span><span class="font2"> by G.

The last of these has&nbsp;been translated into English. There is also a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Geschichte der&nbsp;römischen Litteratur</span><span class="font2"> by G. Munck. The most recent books on the&nbsp;subject in English are Mr. G. A. Simcox’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History of Latin&nbsp;Literature from Ennius to Boethius,</span><span class="font2"> and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History of Roman&nbsp;Literature from the Earliest Period to the Death of Marcus Aurelius,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">by Mr C.

<p><span class="font3">stroke, a decree of the senate (19 </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.)</span><span class="font3"> having sent to Sardinia for military service all Jews capable of bearing&nbsp;arms (Tac., A»»., ii. 85 ; Suet., </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Tiber.,</span><span class="font3"> 36 ; Joseph., </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Antiq.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">xviii. 3, 5). It is probable, however, that after the death&nbsp;(31 </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.)</span><span class="font3"> of Sejanus, to whom this measure had been&nbsp;mainly due, the Jews were expressly permitted to return&nbsp;to Rome, for we are told by Philo </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Leg. ad Caium,</span><span class="font3"> ii. 569,&nbsp;ed. Mangey) that after the death of his favourite Tiberius&nbsp;perceived the Jews to have been unjustly calumniated, and&nbsp;ordered the authorities to refrain from oppressing them.&nbsp;At all events the community must ultimately have come&nbsp;together again, for in the reign of Claudius its existence&nbsp;is again presupposed, the idea of expelling the Jews from&nbsp;the capital having anew been entertained under that&nbsp;emperor. Regarding this proposal, however, accounts&nbsp;vary. According to the Acts of the Apostles (xviii. 2),&nbsp;and also Suetonius </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Claud.,</span><span class="font3"> 25), it was actually carried out;&nbsp;but according to Dio Cassius (lx. 6) the expulsion was&nbsp;only proposed, and, when it was seen to be impracticable&nbsp;without great tumult, all that was done was to withdraw&nbsp;from the Jews their right of meeting. The latter version&nbsp;is doubtless the more correct. The withdrawal of the&nbsp;right of meeting was equivalent to the prohibition of&nbsp;public worship, and sufficiently explains why numbers left&nbsp;the city (Acts xviii. 2). But the main body must have&nbsp;remained and doubtless have again obtained the privilege&nbsp;of assembly, for from the time of Nero onwards we find&nbsp;the Jews in Rome once more flourishing with undiminished&nbsp;vigour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the midst of this Jewish community it was that the Christian congregation doubtless arose. The Jews of&nbsp;the Dispersion, it is well known, kept up an active correspondence with the mother-country in Palestine. Every&nbsp;year they sent their gifts and offerings thither, and every&nbsp;one in a position to do so went in person to the great&nbsp;festivals of the Holy City. As a result of this vigorously&nbsp;maintained intercourse, which was aided also by the&nbsp;interests of trade, tidings of Jesus as the promised Messiah&nbsp;did not fail to reach the capital of the empire. Individual&nbsp;Jews who had become believers came forward in Rome as&nbsp;preachers of the gospel and found acceptance with a section&nbsp;of their countrymen. They found a perhaps still more&nbsp;numerous following among the “God-fearing” or “devout”&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(creßopevoi, cjioßovfj.evoi, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">tou</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"> öeov)</span><span class="font3"> heathen, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> within that&nbsp;large circle which consisted of those who had adopted the&nbsp;faith of the Jews, observed certain of the more important&nbsp;precepts of their law, and also attended their public worship,&nbsp;but did not, strictly speaking, belong to the communion,&nbsp;and thus represented a sort of Judaism of the second order.@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>In proportion as faith in Jesus as the Messiah gained&nbsp;ground within the Jewish community, a separation between&nbsp;the believers and the others would of course become more</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>@@@1 </sup>Many scholars identify these “devout” heathen with the “proselytes of the gate ” who are met with in Rabbinical literature; but in reality the two are quite distinct and unrelated.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
