<p><span class="font1">of his show-rooms and his personal belongings, and after that date he appears neither to have done business in Paris nor to&nbsp;have visited it. Five years later the invasion of Neuwied led&nbsp;to the closing of his workshops; prosperity never returned, and&nbsp;he died half ruined at Wiesbaden on the 12th of February 1807.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Röntgen was not a great cabinet-maker. His forms were often clumsy, ungraceful ana commonplace; his furniture lacked the art-istry of the French and the English cabinet-makers of the great period&nbsp;which came to an end about 1790. His bronzes were, poor in design&nbsp;and coarse in execution—his work, in short, is tainted by commercialism. As a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">marqueteur,</span><span class="font1"> however, he holds a position of high&nbsp;distinction. His marquetry is bolder and more vigorous than that&nbsp;of Riesener, who in other respects soared far above him. As an&nbsp;adroit deviser of mechanism he. fully earned a reputation which&nbsp;former generations rated more highly than the modern critic, with&nbsp;his facilities. for comparison, is prepared to accept. On the&nbsp;mechanical side he produced, with the help of Kintzing, many&nbsp;long-cased and other clocks with ingenious indicating and registering apparatus. Röntgen delighted in architectural forms, and his&nbsp;marquetry more often than not represents those scenes from classical&nbsp;mythology which were the dear delight of the 18th century. He is&nbsp;well represented at South Kensington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RÖNTGEN, WILHELM KONRAD (1845- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), German</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">physicist, was born at Lenncp on the 27th of March 1845. He received his early education in Holland, and then went to&nbsp;study at Zürich, where he took his doctor’s degree in 1869.&nbsp;He then became assistant to Kundt at Würzburg and afterwards at Strassburg, becoming </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">privat-docent</span><span class="font1"> at the latter university in 1874. Next year he was appointed professor of&nbsp;mathematics and physics at the Agricultural Academy of&nbsp;Hohenheim, and in 1876 he returned to Strassburg as extraordinary professor. In 1879 he was chosen ordinary professor&nbsp;of physics and director of the Physical Institute at Giessen,&nbsp;whence in 1885 he removed in the same capacity to Würzburg.&nbsp;It was at the latter place that he made the discovery for which&nbsp;his name is chiefly known, the Röntgen rays. In 1895, while&nbsp;experimenting with a highly exhausted vacuum tube on the&nbsp;conduction of electricity through gases, he noticed that a paper&nbsp;screen covered with barium platinocyanide, which happened&nbsp;to be lying near, became fluorescent under the action of some&nbsp;radiation emitted from the tube, which at the time was enclosed&nbsp;in a box of black cardboard. Further investigation showed&nbsp;that this radiation had the power of passing through various&nbsp;substances which are opaque to ordinary light, and also of&nbsp;affecting a photographic plate. Its behaviour being curious&nbsp;in several respects, particularly in regard to reflection and&nbsp;refraction, doubt arose in his mind whether it was to be looked&nbsp;upon as light or not, and he was led to put forward the hypothesis that it was due to longitudinal vibrations in the ether,&nbsp;not to transverse ones like ordinary light; but in view of the&nbsp;uncertainty existing as to its nature, he called it N-rays. For&nbsp;this discovery he received the Rumford medal of the Royal&nbsp;Society in 1896, jointly with Philip Lenard, who had already&nbsp;shown, as also had Hertz, that a portion of the cathode rays&nbsp;could pass through a thin film of a metal such as aluminium.&nbsp;Röntgen also conducted researches in various other branches&nbsp;of physics, including elasticity, capillarity, the conduction&nbsp;of heat in crystals, the absorption of heat-rays by different&nbsp;gases, piezo-electricity, the electromagnetic rotation of polarized&nbsp;light, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RÖNTGEN RAYS, W. K. Röntgen discovered in 1895 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Wied. Ann.</span><span class="font1"> 64, p. 1) that when the electric discharge passes&nbsp;through a tube exhausted so that the glass of the tube is&nbsp;brightly phosphorescent, phosphorescent substances such as&nbsp;potassium platinocyanide became luminous when brought&nbsp;near to the tube. He found that if a thick piece of metal, a&nbsp;coin for example, were placed between the tube and a plate&nbsp;covered with the phosphorescent substance a sharp shadow&nbsp;of the metal was cast upon the plate; pieces of wood or thin&nbsp;plates of aluminium cast, however, only partial shadows, thus&nbsp;showing that the agent which produced the phosphorescence&nbsp;could traverse with considerable freedom bodies opaque to&nbsp;ordinary light. He found that as a general rule the greater&nbsp;the density of the substance the greater its opacity to this&nbsp;agent. Thus while this effect could pass through the flesh&nbsp;it was stopped by the bones, so that if the hand were held&nbsp;between the discharge tube and a phosphorescent screen the&nbsp;outline of the bones was distinctly visible as a shadow cast&nbsp;upon the screen, or if a purse containing coins were placed&nbsp;between the tube and the screen the purse itself cast but little&nbsp;shadow while the coins cast a very dark one. Röntgen showed&nbsp;that the cause of the phosphorescence, now called Röntgen&nbsp;rays, is propagated in straight lines starting from places where&nbsp;the cathode rays strike against a solid obstacle, and the direction of propagation is not bent when the rays pass from one&nbsp;medium to another, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> there is no refraction of the rays.&nbsp;These rays, unlike cathode rays or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Canalstrahlen,</span><span class="font1"> are not&nbsp;deflected by magnetic force; Röntgen could not detect any&nbsp;deflection with the strongest magnets at his disposal, and later&nbsp;experiments made with stronger magnetic fields have failed&nbsp;to reveal any effect of the magnet on the rays. The rays affect&nbsp;a photographic plate as well as a phosphorescent screen, and&nbsp;shadow photographs can be readily taken. The time of exposure required depends upon the intensity of the rays, and&nbsp;this depends upon the state of the tube, and the electric current&nbsp;going through it, as well as upon the substances traversed by&nbsp;the rays on their journey to the photographic plate. In some&nbsp;cases an exposure of a few seconds is sufficient, in others hours&nbsp;may be required. The rays coming from different discharge&nbsp;tubes have very different powers of penetration. If the pressure&nbsp;in the tube is fairly high, so that the potential difference between&nbsp;its electrodes is small, and the velocity of the cathode rays-in consequence small, the Röntgen rays coming from the tube&nbsp;will be very easily absorbed; such rays are called “ soft rays.”&nbsp;If the exhaustion of the tube is carried further, so that there&nbsp;is a considerable increase* in the potential differences between&nbsp;the cathode and the anode in the tube and- therefore in the&nbsp;velocity of the cathode rays, the Röntgen rays have much&nbsp;greater penetrating power and aie called “ hard rays.” With&nbsp;a highly exhausted tube and a powerful induction coil it is&nbsp;possible to get appreciable effects trom rays which have passed&nbsp;through sheets of brass or iron several millimetres thick. The&nbsp;penetrating power of the rays thus varies with the pressure&nbsp;in the tube; as this pressure gradually diminishes when the discharge is kept running through the tube, the type of Röntgen&nbsp;ray coming from the tube is continually changing. The lowering of pressure due to the current through the tube finally&nbsp;leads to such a high degree of exhaustion that the discharge&nbsp;has great difficulty in passing, and the emission of the rays&nbsp;becomes very irregular. Heating the walls of the tube causes&nbsp;some gas to come off the sides, and by thus increasing the&nbsp;pressure creates a temporary improvement. A thin-walled&nbsp;platinum tube is sometimes fused on to the discharge tube to&nbsp;remedy this defect; red-hot platinum allows hydrogen to pass&nbsp;through it, so that if the platinum tube is heated, hydrogen&nbsp;from the flame will pass into the discharge tube and increase&nbsp;the pressure. In this way hydrogen may be introduced into&nbsp;the tube when the pressure gets too low. When liquid air is&nbsp;available the pressure in the tube may be kept constant by&nbsp;fusing on to the discharge tube a tube containing charcoal;&nbsp;this dips into a vessel containing liquid air, and the charcoal&nbsp;is saturated with air at the pressure which it is desired to&nbsp;maintain in the tube. Not only do bulbs emit different&nbsp;types of rays at different times, but the same bulb emits at&nbsp;the same time rays of different kinds. The property by which&nbsp;it is most convenient to identify a ray is the absorption it&nbsp;suffers when it passes through a given thickness of aluminium&nbsp;or tin-foil. Experiments made by McClelland and Sir J. J.&nbsp;Thomson on the absorption of the rays produced by sheets&nbsp;of tin-foil showed that the absorption by the first sheets of&nbsp;tin-foil traversed by -the rays was much greater than that by&nbsp;the same number of sheets when the rays had already passed&nbsp;through several sheets of the foil. The effect is just what&nbsp;would occur if some of the rays were much more readily absorbed&nbsp;by the tin-foil than others, for the first few layers would stop&nbsp;all the easily absorbable rays while the ones left would be&nbsp;those that were but little absorbed by tin-foil.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
