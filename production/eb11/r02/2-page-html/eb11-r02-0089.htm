<p><span class="font1">female cell: the latter possibility is to some extent realized in those Algae </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g. Ulothrix, Ectocarpuf)</span><span class="font1"> in which the sexual&nbsp;cells (isogametcs), if they fail to conjugate, germinate independently as gonidia, giving rise to gametophytes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thc more familiar mode is that of vegetative budding, as already mentioned. When a “ viviparous ” fern or Phanerogam&nbsp;reproduces itself by a bud or a bulbil, both spore-formation and&nbsp;the sexual act are passed over: sporophyte springs from sporophyte. Remarkable cases of this have been observed in certain&nbsp;Phanerogams </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Coelebogyne ilicifolia, Fnnkia ovata, Nothoscordnm&nbsp;fragrans, Citrus,</span><span class="font1"> sp. of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Euonymus, Opuntia vulgaris)</span><span class="font1"> in the ovule&nbsp;of which adventitious embryos are formed by budding from cells&nbsp;of the nucellus: with the exception of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Coelebogyne,</span><span class="font1"> it appears&nbsp;that this only takes place after the oosphere has been fertilized.&nbsp;In other plants it is the gametophyte that reproduces itself by&nbsp;means of gemmae or bulbils, as commonly in the Bryophyta,&nbsp;the prothallia of ferns, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The abnormalities described are all traceable to reproductive degeneration; the final result of which is that true reproduction&nbsp;is replaced more or less completely by vegetative propagation.&nbsp;It may be inquired whether degeneration may have proceeded&nbsp;so far in any plant of sufficiently high organization to present&nbsp;spore-formation, or sexual reproduction, or both, as to cause&nbsp;the plant to reproduce itself entirely and exclusively by the vegetative method. The only such case that suggests itself is that of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Caulerpa</span><span class="font1"> and possibly some other Siphonaceous Green Algae.&nbsp;In this plant no special reproductive organs have yet been&nbsp;discovered, and it certainly reproduces itself by the breaking off&nbsp;of portions of the body which become complete plants: but&nbsp;it is quite possible that reproductive organs may yet be discovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">V. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Physiology of Reproduction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The reproductive capacity of plants, as of animals, depends upon the fact that the whole or part of the protoplasm of the&nbsp;individual can develop into one or more new organisms in one&nbsp;or other of several possible ways. Thus, in the case of unicellular&nbsp;plants, the whole of the protoplasm of the parent gives rise,&nbsp;whether by simple division or otherwise, to one or more new&nbsp;plants. Reproduction necessarily closes the life of the individual:&nbsp;here, as August Weismann long ago pointed out, there is no&nbsp;natural death, for the whole of the protoplasm of the parent&nbsp;continues to live in the progeny. In multicellular plants, on&nbsp;the contrary’ the reproductive function is mainly discharged by&nbsp;certain parts of the body, the reproductive organs, the remainder&nbsp;of the body being essentially vegetative—-that is, concerned&nbsp;with the maintenance of the individual. In these plants it is&nbsp;only a part of the protoplasm that continues to live in their&nbsp;progeny; the remainder, the vegetative part, eventually dies.&nbsp;It is therefore possible to distinguish in them, on the one&nbsp;hand, the essentially reproductive protoplasm, which may be&nbsp;designated by Weismann’s term </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">germ-plasm,</span><span class="font1"> though without&nbsp;necessarily adopting all that his use of it implies, and the&nbsp;essentially vegetative, mortal protoplasm, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">somatoplasm,</span><span class="font1"> on&nbsp;the other. In the unicellular plant no such distinction can be&nbsp;drawn, for the whole of the protoplasm is concerned in reproduction. But even in the most highly organized multicellular&nbsp;plant this distinction is not absolute: for, as already explained,&nbsp;plants can, in general, be propagated by the isolation of almost&nbsp;any part of the body, that is vegetatively, and this implies the&nbsp;presence of germ-plasm elsewhere than in the special reproductive organs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If the attempt be made to distinguish between the organs of vegetative propagation and those of true reproduction, the&nbsp;nearest approach would be the statement that the former contain&nbsp;both germ-plasm and somatoplasm, whereas the latter, or at&nbsp;least the reproductive cells, consist entirely of germ-plasm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The question now arises as to thc exact scat of the germ-plasm, and the answer is to be looked for in the results of the numerous&nbsp;researches into thc structure and development of the reproductive&nbsp;cells that form so large a part of the biological work of recent&nbsp;years. Thc various facts already mentioned suffice to prove&nbsp;that the nucleus plays the leading part in the reproductive&nbsp;processes of whatever kind: the general conclusion is justified&nbsp;that no reproductive cell can develop into a new organism if&nbsp;deprived of its nucleus. It may be inferred that the nucleus&nbsp;either actually contains the germ-plasm, or that it controls and&nbsp;directs the activities of the germ-plasm present in the cell. It&nbsp;is not improbable that both these inferences may bc true. At&nbsp;any rate there is no sufficient ground for excluding the cooperation of the cytoplasm, especially of that part of it distinguished as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kinoplasm,</span><span class="font1"> in the reproductive processes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pursuing the ascertained facts with regard to thc nucleus, it is established that the part of it especially concerned is the&nbsp;linin-network which consists of the chromosomes. The behaviour, as already described, of the chromosomes in the&nbsp;various reproductive processes has led to the conclusion that the&nbsp;hereditary characters of the parent or parents are transmitted&nbsp;in and by them to the progeny: that they constitute, in fact,&nbsp;the material basis of heredity (see Heredity). They can hardly,&nbsp;however, be regarded as the ultimate structural units, for the&nbsp;simple reason that their number is far too small in relation to&nbsp;the transmissible characters. It has been suggested (Farmer)&nbsp;that the chromomeres are the units, but the number of these&nbsp;would seem to be hardly sufficient. It seems necessary to fall&nbsp;back upon hypothetical ultimate particles, as suggested by&nbsp;Darwin, de Vries and Weismann, which may be generally termed&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pangens.</span><span class="font1"> The chromomeres may be regarded as aggregates of&nbsp;such particles, the “ ids ” of Weismann.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The foregoing considerations make it possible to attempt an explanation of the various reproductive processes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vegetative Propagation—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">M</span><span class="font1"> is easily intelligible that the two individuals produced by the division of a unicellular plant&nbsp;should resemble the parent and each other; for, the division&nbsp;of the parent-nucleus being homotypic, the chromosomes&nbsp;which go to constitute the nucleus of each daughter-cell are&nbsp;alike both in number and in nature, and exactly repeat the&nbsp;constitution of the parent-nucleus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the more complicated cases of propagation by bulbils, cuttings, &amp;c., the development of the new individual, or of the&nbsp;missing parts of the individual (roots, &amp;c.), may be ascribed&nbsp;to the presence in the bulbil or cutting of the necessary pangens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reproduction by Gonidia.—</span><span class="font1">In this case a single cell gives rise to a complete new organism resembling the parent. The&nbsp;inference is that the gonidium is a portion of the parental germ-plasm, in which all the necessary pangens have been accumulated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reproduction by Spores.—</span><span class="font1">In this case, also, an entire organism is developed from a single cell, but with this peculiarity that&nbsp;the resulting organism is unlike that which bore the spore, a&nbsp;peculiarity which has not yet been explained. It has been&nbsp;already stated that the development of true spores involves&nbsp;meiosis, and this process is no doubt related to the behaviour&nbsp;of the spore on germination; but the nature of this relation&nbsp;remains obscure. It might be assumed that, as the result&nbsp;of meiosis, the nucleus of the spore receives only gametophytic&nbsp;pangens. But the assumption is rendered impossible by the&nbsp;fact that the spore gives rise to a sexual organism, the reproductive cells of which, after thc sexual act, produce a sporophyte. Clearly sporophytic pangens must be present as well&nbsp;in' the spore as in the gametophyte and in its sexual cells. It&nbsp;can only be surmised that they exist there in a latent condition,&nbsp;dominated, as it were, by the gametophytic pangens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sexual Reproduction.—</span><span class="font1">Here, again, as yet unanswered questions present themselves. The essence of a sexual cell&nbsp;is that it cannot give rise by itself to a new organism, it is only&nbsp;truly reproductive after the sexual act: this peculiarity is&nbsp;just what constitutes its </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sexuality.</span><span class="font1"> Minute investigation has&nbsp;not yet detected any essential structural difference between&nbsp;a sexual cell and a spore; on the contrary, the results so far&nbsp;obtained have established that they essentially agree in&nbsp;being post-meiotic (haploid). Why then do they differ so&nbsp;fundamentally in their reproductive capacities? Again,&nbsp;sexual cells differ in sex; but there arc as yet no facts to&nbsp;demonstrate any essential structural difference between male</span></p>
