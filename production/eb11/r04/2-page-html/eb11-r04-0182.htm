<p><span class="font2">Röntgen rays. The nature of this effect may be illustrated by fig. i. Suppose that AB is a stream of cathode rays striking&nbsp;against a solid obstacle B and&nbsp;giving rise to Röntgen rays, let&nbsp;these rays impinge on a small&nbsp;body P, P under these conditions will emit secondary rays&nbsp;in all directions. Barkla </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{Phil.&nbsp;Trans.</span><span class="font2">, 1905, A, 204, p. 467;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Proc. Roy. Soc. p,</span><span class="font2"> p. 247)&nbsp;found that the intensity of&nbsp;the secondary rays, tested by&nbsp;the ionization they produced&nbsp;in air, was less intense in the&nbsp;plane ABP than in a plane through PB at right angles to this&nbsp;plane, the distances from P being the same in the two cases;&nbsp;the difference in the intensities amounting to about 15%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Haga </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Ann. d. Phys.</span><span class="font2"> 28, p. 439), who tried a similar experiment hut used a photographic method to measure the intensity of the secondary rays, could not detect any difference&nbsp;of intensity in the two planes, but experiments by Bassler&nbsp;(/In», </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">der Phys.</span><span class="font2"> 28, p. 808) and Vegard </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Proc. Roy. Soc.</span><span class="font2"> 83,&nbsp;p. 379) have confirmed Barkla’s original observations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The “ polarization ” is much more marked if instead of exciting the secondary radiation in P by the Röntgen rays from a discharge&nbsp;tube we do so by means of secondary rays. If, for example, in the&nbsp;case illustrated by fig. 1 we allow a beam of Röntgen rays to fall&nbsp;upon B instead of the cathode rays, the difference between the&nbsp;intensities in the plane ABP and in the plane at right angles to it&nbsp;are very much increased. _ It is only the scattered secondaiy&nbsp;radiation which shows this “polarization”; the characteristic&nbsp;secondary radiation emitted by the body at P is quite unpolarized.&nbsp;The existence of this effect has a very important bearing on the&nbsp;nature of Röntgen rays. Whether Röntgen rays are or are not a&nbsp;form of light, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t.e.</span><span class="font2"> are some form of electromagnetic disturbance&nbsp;propagated through the aether, is a question on which opinion is&nbsp;not unanimous. They resemble light in their rectilinear propagation;&nbsp;they affect a photographic plate and, Brandes and Dorn have shown,&nbsp;they produce an effect, though a small one, on the retina, .giving&nbsp;rise to a very faint illumination of the whole field of view. They&nbsp;resemble light in not being deflected by either electric or magnetic&nbsp;forces, while the characteristic secondary radiation may be compared&nbsp;with the phosphorescence produced by ultra-violet light, and the&nbsp;cathodic secondary rays with the photo-electric effect. . The&nbsp;absence of refraction is not an argument against the rays being a&nbsp;kind of light, for all theories of refraction make this property depend&nbsp;upon the relation • between the natural time of vibration T of the&nbsp;refracting substance and the period Z of the light vibrations, the&nbsp;refraction vanishing when Z/T is very small. Thus there would be&nbsp;no refraction for light of a very small period, and this would also be&nbsp;true if instead of regular periodic undulations we had a pulse of&nbsp;electromagnetic disturbance, provided the time taken by the light&nbsp;to travel over the thickness of the pulse is small compared with the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">g</span><span class="font2">iriods of vibration of the molecules of the refracting substance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">xperiments on the diffraction of Röntgen rays are very difficult, for, in addition to the difficulties caused by the smallness.</span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font2">the wavelength or the thinness of the pulse, the secondary radiation produced&nbsp;when the rays strike against a photographic plate or pass, through&nbsp;air might give rise to what might easily be mistaken for diffraction&nbsp;effects. Röntgen has never succeeded in observing effects which&nbsp;prove the existence of diffraction. Fomm </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Wied. Ann.</span><span class="font2"> 59, p. 50)&nbsp;observed in the photograph of a narrow slit light and.dark bands&nbsp;which looked like diffraction bands; but observation with slits of&nbsp;different sizes showed that they were not of this nature, and Haga&nbsp;and Wind </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Wied. Ann.</span><span class="font2"> 68, p. 884) have explained them as contrast&nbsp;effects. These observers, however, noticed with a very narrow&nbsp;wedge-shaped slit a broadening of the image, of the narrow part&nbsp;which they are satisfied could not be explained by the causes.&nbsp;Walter and Pohl </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Ann. der Phys.</span><span class="font2"> 29, p. 331) could not observe&nbsp;any diffraction effects, though their arrangement would have&nbsp;enabled them to do so if the wave-length had not been smaller than&nbsp;1 *5 X io-<sup>9</sup>cm. Sir George Stokes </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Proc. Manchester Lit. and Phil. Soc.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">1898) put forward the view that the disturbances which constitute&nbsp;the rays are not regular periodic undulations but very thin pulses.&nbsp;Thomson </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Phil. Mag.</span><span class="font2"> 45, p. 172) has shown that when charged&nbsp;particles are suddenly stopped, pulses of very intense electric and&nbsp;magnetic disturbances are started. As the cathode rays consist of&nbsp;negatively electrified particles, the impact of these on a solid would&nbsp;give rise to these intense pulses. The electromagnetic theory&nbsp;therefore shows that effects resembling light, inasmuch as they are&nbsp;electromagnetic disturbances propagated through the aether, must&nbsp;be produced when the cathode rays strike against an obstacle.&nbsp;Since under these circumstances Röntgen rays are produced, it&nbsp;seems natural, unless direct evidence to the contrary is obtained,&nbsp;to connect the Röntgen rays with these pulses. This view explains&nbsp;very simply the “ polarization” of the rays; for, suppose the cathode&nbsp;particle moving from A to B were stopped at its first impact with&nbsp;the plate B (fig. 1), the electric force transmitted along BP would&nbsp;be in the plane ABP at right angles to BP. When this electric&nbsp;force reached the body at P it would accelerate any electrified&nbsp;particles in that body, the. acceleration being parallel to AB. Each&nbsp;of these accelerated particles would, start electric waves. The&nbsp;theory of such waves shows that their intensity vanishes along a&nbsp;line through the particle parallel to the direction of acceleration,&nbsp;while it is a maximum at right angles to this line; thus the intensity&nbsp;of the rays along a horizontal line through P would vanish, while it&nbsp;would be a maximum in the plane at right angles to this line. </span><span class="font1">In&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">this case there would be complete polarization. In reality the&nbsp;cathode particle is not. stopped at its first encounter, but makes&nbsp;many collisions, changing its direction between each; and these&nbsp;collisions will send out electric disturbances which when they fall&nbsp;on P are able to excite waves which send some energy along PC.&nbsp;The polarization will therefore be only partial and will be of the&nbsp;kind found by Barkla.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The velocity with which the waves travel has not yet been definitely settled. Marx </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Ann. der Phys.</span><span class="font2"> 20, p. 677) by an ingenious&nbsp;but elaborate method came to the conclusion that they travelled&nbsp;with the velocity of light; his interpretation of his experiments&nbsp;has, however, been criticized by Franck and Pohl </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Verh. d. D.&nbsp;Physik Ges.</span><span class="font2"> 10, p. 489).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another view of the nafure of Röntgen rays has been advocated by Bragg </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Phil. Mag..</span><span class="font2"> 14, p. 429); he regards them as neutral&nbsp;electric doublets consisting of a negative and a positive charge of&nbsp;electricity which are usually held together by the attraction between&nbsp;them, but which may be knocked asunder when the rays strike&nbsp;against matter and turned into cathodic rays. On this view when&nbsp;the rays pass through a gas only a few of the molecules of the gas&nbsp;are struck by the rays and so we can easily understand why so few&nbsp;of the molecules are ionized. On the ordinary view </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font2">an electric&nbsp;wave all the molecules would be affected by the wave when it passed&nbsp;through a gas, and to explain the small fraction ionized we must&nbsp;either suppose that systems sensitive to the Röntgen rays are at&nbsp;any time present only in a very small fraction of the molecule or&nbsp;else that the front of an electric or light wave is not continuous but&nbsp;that the energy is concentrated in patches which only occupy a&nbsp;fraction of the wave front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Apparatus for producing Röntgen Rays.—</span><span class="font2">The tube now used most frequently for producing Röntgen rays is of the kind introduced by&nbsp;Porter and known as a focus tube (fig. 2). The cathode is a&nbsp;portion of a hollow sphere,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">and the cathode rays come</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">to a point on or near a</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">metal plate A, called the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">anti-cathode, connected</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">with the anode; this plate</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">is the source of the rays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This ought to be made of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">a very unfusible metal</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">such as platinum or, still</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">better, tantalum, and kept</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">cool by a water-cooling</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">arrangement. The anti-cathode is generally set at an angle of 45° to the rays; it is probable. that the 'action of the tube&nbsp;would be improved by putting the anti-cathode at right angles&nbsp;to the cathode rays. The walls of the tube get strongly electrified. This electrification affects the working of the tube,&nbsp;and the production of rays can often be improved by having an&nbsp;earth-connected piece of tin-foil on the outside, of the bulb, and&nbsp;moving it about until the best position is attained. . To produce&nbsp;the discharge an induction coil is generally employed with a mercury&nbsp;interrupter. Excellent results have been obtained by using an&nbsp;electrostatic induction machine to produce the current, the emission&nbsp;of rays is more uniform than when an induction coil is.used. The&nbsp;rays are emitted pretty uniformly in all directions until the plane&nbsp;of the anti-cathode is approached; in the neighbourhood of this&nbsp;plane there is a rapid falling off in the intensity of the rays. After&nbsp;long use the glass of the bulb often becomes distinctly purple.&nbsp;This is believed to be due to the presence of manganese compounds&nbsp;in the glass.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J. J. T.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROOD (O.E. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">r6d,</span><span class="font2"> a stick, another form of <sup>a</sup> rod,” O.E. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rodd, </span><span class="font2">possibly cognate with Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rudis&gt;</span><span class="font2"> a staff), properly a rod or&nbsp;pole, and so used as the name of a surface measure of land. The&nbsp;rood varies locally but is generally taken as = 40 square rods,&nbsp;poles or perches; 4 roods = 1 acre. The term was, however,&nbsp;particularly applied, in O.E., to a gallows or cross, especially&nbsp;to the Holy Cross on which Christ was crucified, the sense in&nbsp;which the word survives. A crucifix, often accompanied hy&nbsp;figures of St John and the Virgin Mary, was usually placed in&nbsp;churches ahove the screen, hence known as “ rood screen ”</span></p>
