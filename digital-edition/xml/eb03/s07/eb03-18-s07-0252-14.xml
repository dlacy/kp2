or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sincellus,</hi> an ancient officer in the family of the patriarchs, and other prelates of the eastern church. The word, in the corrupt Greek, συγϰηλλος, signifies a person who lies in the chamber with another ; a <hi rend="italic">chamber-fellow,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">chum.</hi> The ſyncellus was an eccleſiaſtic, who lived with the patriarch of Conſtantinople, to be a witneſs of his conduct ; whence it is, that the ſyncellus was also called the <hi rend="italic">patriarch’s eye,</hi> becauſe his buſineſs was to obſerve and watch. The other prelates had alſo their ſyncelli, who were clerks living in the houſe with them, and even lying in the ſame chamber, to be witnesses of the purity of their manners. Afterwards the office degenerated into a mere dignity ; and there were made ſyncelli of churches.— At laſt it became a title of honour, and was beſtowed by the emperor on the prelates themſelves ; whom they called <hi rend="italic">pontifical ſyncelli,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ſyncelli Augustales.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
