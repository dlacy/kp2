<p><span class="font1">may be credited, he had not learnt even Latin. But in middle life he inherited some property, and he was thus able to devote&nbsp;himself to the practice of poetry, in which he was the faithful,&nbsp;and perhaps the most distinguished, disciple of Malherbe. He&nbsp;had known Malherbe when he was a page at the court of&nbsp;Henry IV., and had early contributed to the fashionable albums&nbsp;of the day. In 1625 he published his most important work,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bergeries, </span><span class="font1">a dramatic pastoral in five acts, a part of which,&nbsp;entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Arthénice,</span><span class="font1"> was played in 1618. Racan was also the&nbsp;author of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sept psaumes</span><span class="font1"> (1631), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Odes sacrées tirées des psaumes de&nbsp;David</span><span class="font1"> (1651), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dernières œuvres et poésies chrétiennes</span><span class="font1"> (1660), in&nbsp;all of which he was hampered by his inability to read the sacred&nbsp;writings except in other French paraphrases. He was one of&nbsp;the original members of the French Academy. He died in&nbsp;February 1670.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RACCONIGI, a town of Piedmont, Italy, in the province of Cuηeo, 24 m. S. of Turin, and 31 m. N. of Cuneo by rail, 837 ft.&nbsp;above sea-level. Pop. (1901) 7364 (town); 9077 (commune).&nbsp;It has a royal chateau built in 1570, with a large park laid out&nbsp;in 1755 by the French gardener Molard from designs by Le&nbsp;Notre, and enlarged in 1835. Since 1901 it has been the summer&nbsp;residence of the king of Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RACCOON (or Racoon), a name borne by the typical repre-sentative of a group of American arboreal placental mammals belonging to the order Carnivora (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q. υ. </span><span class="font1">) and the family&nbsp;Procyonidae. The word is a corruption of the North-American&nbsp;Indian “ arrathkune ” or “ arathcone. ” The Fr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raton</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raton laveur,</span><span class="font1"> Ger. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Waschbar,</span><span class="font1"> and other European names are&nbsp;derived from a curious habit the raccoon has of dipping or washing&nbsp;its food in water before eating it. The typical raccoon (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Procyon&nbsp;lotor</span><span class="font1">) is a thickly built animal about the size of a badger, with&nbsp;a coat of long coarse greyish-brown hairs, short ears, and a&nbsp;bushy black-and-white-ringed tail. Its range extends over the&nbsp;whole of the United States, and stretches on the west northwards to Alaska and southwards well into Central America, where it&nbsp;attains its maximum size. The following notes on the habits&nbsp;of the raccoon are from Dr C. Hart Merriam’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Mammals of&nbsp;the Adirοndacks*. —</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">‟Raccoons are omnivorous beasts and feed upon mice, small birds, birds’ eggs, turtles and their eggs, frogs, fish, crayfish, molluscs,&nbsp;insects, nuts, fruits, maize and sometimes poultry-. Excepting&nbsp;alone the bats and flying-squirrels, they are the most strictly&nbsp;nocturnal of all our mammals, and yet I have several times seen&nbsp;them abroad on cloudy days. They haunt the banks of ponds&nbsp;and streams, and find much of their food in these places, such as&nbsp;crayfish, mussels and fish, although they are unable to dive and&nbsp;pursue the latter under water, like the otter and mink. They are&nbsp;good swimmers and do not hesitate to cross rivers that lie in their&nbsp;path.... The raccoon hibernates during the severest part of&nbsp;the winter, retiring to its nest rather early, and appearing again&nbsp;in February or March, according to the earliness or lateness of the&nbsp;season. It makes its home high up in the hollow of some large&nbsp;tree, preferring a dead limb to the trunk itself. It does little in&nbsp;the way of constructing a nest, and from four to six young are&nbsp;commonly born at a time, generally early in April in this region.&nbsp;The young remain with the mother about a year. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The South-American species, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">P. cancrivorus,</span><span class="font1"> the crab-eating raccoon, is very similar to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">P. lotor,</span><span class="font1"> but differs by its shorter fur,&nbsp;larger size, proportionally more powerful teeth and other minor&nbsp;characters. It extends over the whole of South America, as far&nbsp;south as the Rio Negro, and is common in all suitable localities.&nbsp;Its habits are similar to those of the North-American species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RACCOON-DOG </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Nyctereutes procyonoides),</span><span class="font1"> a small wild dog, with sharp-pointed muzzle, short rounded ears, bushy tail and&nbsp;long fur, found in China, Japan and Amurland. The total&nbsp;length is about 32 in., of which the tail measures 4 in. The&nbsp;prevailing hues are black and dusky yellow, the distribution of&nbsp;which varies in different individuals. In habit these dogs are&nbsp;chiefly nocturnal; and they are said to hibernate. In winter&nbsp;they feed on fish, and in summer on mice, forming small packs&nbsp;to hunt their prey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RACE, an homonymous word of which the principal meanings are (1) a trial or contest of speed; (2) a tribe, breed, a group of&nbsp;individuals descended from a common ancestor. In the first&nbsp;case the word is an adaptation of O. Nor. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rás,</span><span class="font1"> a cognate form in&nbsp;O. E. being </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raés,</span><span class="font1"> rush, onset; while the O.

<p><span class="font1">RACHEL (1821-1858), French actress, whose real name was Elizabeth Felix, the daughter of poor Jew pedlars, was born on the 28th of February 1821, at Mumpf, in the canton of Aargau,&nbsp;Switzerland. At Reims she and her elder sister, Sophia, afterwards known as Sarah, joined a troupe of Italian children who&nbsp;made their living by singing in the cafés, Sarah singing and&nbsp;Elizabeth, then only four years of age, collecting the coppers.&nbsp;In 1830 they came to Paris, where they sang in the streets,&nbsp;Rachel giving such patriotic songs as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Parisienne</span><span class="font1"> and the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Marseillaise</span><span class="font1"> with a rude but precocious energy which evoked&nbsp;special admiration and an abundant shower of coppers. Étienne&nbsp;Choron, a famous teacher of singing, was so impressed with the&nbsp;talents of the two sisters that he undertook to give them&nbsp;gratuitous instruction, and after his death in 1833 they were&nbsp;received into the Conservatoire. Rachel made her first appearance at the Gymnase in Paul Duport’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">La Vendéenne</span><span class="font1"> on the 4th&nbsp;of April 1837, with only mediocre success. But on the 12th of&nbsp;June in the following year she succeeded, after great difficulty,&nbsp;in making a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">début</span><span class="font1"> at the Théâtre Français, as Camille in&nbsp;Corneille’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Horace,</span><span class="font1"> when her remarkable genius at once received&nbsp;general recognition. In the same year she played Roxane in&nbsp;Racine’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bajazet,</span><span class="font1"> winning a complete triumph, but it was in&nbsp;Racine’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Phèdre,</span><span class="font1"> which she first played on the 21st of January&nbsp;1843, that her peculiar gifts were most strikingly manifested.&nbsp;Her range of characters was limited, but within it she was&nbsp;unsurpassable. She excelled particularly in the impersonation&nbsp;of evil or malignant passion, in her presentation of which there&nbsp;was a majesty and dignity which fascinated while it repelled.&nbsp;By careful training her voice, originally hard and harsh, had&nbsp;become flexible and melodious, and its low and muffled notes&nbsp;under the influence of passion possessed a thrilling and penetrating quality that was irresistible. In plays by contemporary&nbsp;authors she created the characters of Judith and Cleopatra in&nbsp;the tragedies of Madame de Girardin, but perhaps her most&nbsp;successful appearance was in 1849 in Scribe and Legouvé’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adrienne</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lecouvreur,</span><span class="font1"> which was written for her.
