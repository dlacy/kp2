<p><span class="font2">RUTILIUS CLAUDIUS NAMATIANUS, Roman poet, flourished at the beginning of the 5th century a.d. He was the author of a La&lt;tin poem, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">De Reditu Suo,</span><span class="font2"> in elegiac metre, describing a coast voyage from Rome to Gaul in a.d. 416. The&nbsp;literary excellence of the work, and the flashes of light which it&nbsp;throws across a momentous but dark epoch of history, combine&nbsp;to give it exceptional importance among the relics of late&nbsp;Roman literature. The poem was in two books; the exordium&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font2">the first and the greater part of the second have been lost.&nbsp;What remains consists of about seven hundred lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The author is a native of S. Gaul (Toulouse or perhaps Poitiers), and belonged, like Sidonius, to one of the great governing&nbsp;families of the Gaulish provinces. His father, whom he calls&nbsp;Lachanius, had held high offices in Italy and at the imperial&nbsp;court, had been governor of Tuscia (Etruria and Umbria),&nbsp;then imperial treasurer </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(comes sacrarum largitionum),</span><span class="font2"> imperial&nbsp;recorder </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(quaestor),</span><span class="font2"> and governor of the capital itself </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(praefectus&nbsp;urbi).</span><span class="font2"> Rutilius boasts his career to have been no less distinguished than his father’s, and particularly indicates that he&nbsp;had been secretary of state </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(magister officiorum)</span><span class="font2"> and governor&nbsp;of the capital (i. 157, 427, 467, 561). After reaching manhood,&nbsp;he passed through the tempestuous period between the death&nbsp;of Theodosius (395) and the fall of the usurper Attalus, which&nbsp;occurred near the date when his poem was written. He&nbsp;witnessed the chequered career of Stilicho as actual, though&nbsp;not titular, emperor of the West; he saw the hosts of Rada-gaisus rolled back from Italy, only to sweep over Gaul and&nbsp;Spain; the defeats and triumphs of Alaric; the three sieges and&nbsp;fln^l sack of Rome, followed by the marvellous recovery of&nbsp;the, cityj Heraclian’s vast armament dissipated; and the fall&nbsp;of seven pretenders to the Western diadem. Undoubtedly the&nbsp;sympathies of Rutilius were with those who during this period&nbsp;dissented from and, when they could, opposed the general&nbsp;tendencies of the imperial poUcy. We know from himself that&nbsp;he was the intimate of those who belonged to the circle of the&nbsp;great orator Symmachus—men who scouted Stilicho’s compact&nbsp;with the Goths, and led the Roman senate to support the pretenders Eugenius and Attalus in the vain hope of reinstating the&nbsp;gods whom Julian had failed to save.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While making but few direct assertions about historical characters or events, the poem forces on us important conclusions concerning the politics and religion of the time. The attitude of&nbsp;the writer towards paganism is remarkable. The whole poem is&nbsp;intensely pagan, and is penetrated by the feeling that the world&nbsp;of literature and culture is and must remain pagan; that outside&nbsp;paganism lies. a realm of barbarism. .The poet wears an air of&nbsp;exalted' superiority over the religious innovators of his day, and&nbsp;Entertains a buoyant confidence that the future of the ancient gods&nbsp;of Rome will not belie their glorious past. Invective and apology&nbsp;he scorns alike, nor troubles himself to. show, with Claudian, even&nbsp;a suppressed grief at the indignities put upon the old religion by&nbsp;the new. As. a statesman, he is at pains to avoid offending those&nbsp;politic Christian senators over whom pride in their country had at&nbsp;least as great power as attachment to their new religion. Only&nbsp;once or twice does Rutilius speak directly of Christianity, and&nbsp;then only to attack the monks, whom the temporal authorities&nbsp;had hardly as yet recognized, and whom, indeed, only a short&nbsp;time before, a Christian emperor had forced by thousands into&nbsp;the ranks of his army. Judaism Rutilius could assail without&nbsp;wounding either pagans or Christians, but he intimates, not obscurely, that, he hates it chiefly as the evil root whence the rank&nbsp;plant of Christianity had sprung.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We read in Gibbon that “ Honorius excluded all persons who were adverse to the catholic church from holding any office in the&nbsp;state,” that he “ obstinately rejected the service of all those who&nbsp;dissented from his religion,” and that “ the law was applied in&nbsp;the utmost latitude and rigorously executed.” Far different is&nbsp;the picture of political life impressed upon us by Rutilius. His&nbsp;voice is assuredly not that of a partisan of a discredited and overborne faction. We see by the aid of his poem a senate at Rome&nbsp;composed of past office-holders, the majority of whom were certainly&nbsp;pagan still. We discern a Christian section whose Christianity&nbsp;was. political rather than religious, who were Romans first and&nbsp;Christians afterwards, whom a new breeze in politics might easily&nbsp;have wafted back to the old religion. Between these two sections the broad old Roman toleration reigns. Some ecclesiastical&nbsp;historians have fondly imagined that after the sack of Rome the&nbsp;bishop Innocent returned to a position of predominance. No one&nbsp;who fairly reads Rutilius can cherish this idea. The air of the&nbsp;capital, perhaps even of Italy, was still charged with paganism.&nbsp;The court, was far in advance of the people, and the persecuting&nbsp;laws were in large part incapable of execution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Perhaps the most interesting lines in the whole poem are those in which Rutilius assails the memory of “ dire Stilicho,” as he&nbsp;names him. Stilicho,.“ fearing to suffer all that had caused himself&nbsp;to be feared,” annihilated those defences of Alps and Apennines&nbsp;which the provident gods had interposed between the barbarians&nbsp;and the Eternal City, and planted the cruel Goths, his “ skin-clad ” minions, in the very sanctuary of the empire. His wile&nbsp;was wickeder than the wile of the Trojan horse, than the wile of&nbsp;Althaea or of Scylla. May Nero rest from all the torments of&nbsp;the damned, that they may seize on Stilicho; for Nero smote his&nbsp;own mother, but Stilicho the mother of the world!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We shall not err in supposing that we have here (what we find nowhere else) an authentic expression of the feeling entertained by&nbsp;a majority of the Roman senate concerning Stilicho. He had but&nbsp;imitated the policy of Theodosius with regard to the barbarians;&nbsp;but even that great emperor had met with passive opposition from&nbsp;the old Roman families. The relations, however, between Alaric&nbsp;and Stilicho had been closer and more mysterious than those&nbsp;between Alaric and Theodosius, and men who had seen Stilicho&nbsp;surrounded by his body-guard of Goths.not unnaturally looked&nbsp;on the Goths who assailed Rome as Stilicho’s avengers. It is&nbsp;noteworthy that Rutilius speaks of the crime of Stilicho in terms&nbsp;far different from those used by Orosius and the historians of the&nbsp;lower empire. They believed that Stilicho was plotting to make&nbsp;his son emperor, and that he called in the Goths in order to climb&nbsp;higher. Rutilius holds that he used the barbarians merely to save&nbsp;himself from impending ruin. The Christian historians assert&nbsp;that Stilicho designed to restore paganism.. To Rutilius he is the&nbsp;most uncompromising foe of paganism. His crowning sin (recorded&nbsp;by. the poet alone) was the destruction of the Sibylline books—&nbsp;a sin worthy of one who had decked his wife in the spoils of Victory,&nbsp;the goddess who had for centuries presided over tne deliberations&nbsp;of tne senate. This crime of Stilicho alone is sufficient in the&nbsp;eyes of Rutilius to account for the disasters that afterwards befell&nbsp;tne city, just as Merobaudes, a generation or two later, traced the&nbsp;miseries of his own day to the overthrow of the ancient rites of Vesta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With regard to the form of the poem, Rutilius handles the elegiac couplet with great metrical purity and freedom, and betrays&nbsp;many signs of long study in the elegiac poetry of the Augustan&nbsp;era. The Latin is unusually clean for the times, and is generally&nbsp;fairly, classical both in vocabulary and construction. The taste of&nbsp;Rutilius, too, is comparatively pure. If he lacks the genius of&nbsp;Claudian, he also lacks, his overloaded gaudiness and nis large&nbsp;exaggeration, and the directness of Rutilius shines by comparison&nbsp;with the laboured complexity of Ausonius. It is common to call&nbsp;Claudian the last of the Roman poets. That title might fairly be&nbsp;claimed for Rutilius, unless it be reserved for Merobaudes. At&nbsp;any rate, in passing from Rutilius to Sidonius no reader can fail to&nbsp;feel that he has left the region of Latin poetry for the region of&nbsp;Latin verse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of the many interesting details of the poem we can only mention a few. At the outset we have an almost dithyrambic address to&nbsp;the goddess Roma, whose glory has ever shone the brighter for&nbsp;disaster, and who will rise once more in her might and confound&nbsp;her barbarian foes. The poet shows as deep a consciousness as any&nbsp;modern historian that the grandest achievement of Rome was the&nbsp;spread of law. Next we get incidental but not unimportant references to the destruction of roads and property wrought by the&nbsp;Goths, to the state of the havens at the mouths of the Tiber, and&nbsp;the general decay of nearly all the old commercial ports on the coast.&nbsp;Most of these were as desolate then as now. Rutilius even exaggerates the desolation of the once important city of Cosa in Etruria,&nbsp;whose walls have scarcely changed from that day to ours. The&nbsp;port that served Pisae, almost alone of all those visited by Rutilius,&nbsp;seems to have retained its prosperity, and to have foreshadowed&nbsp;the subsequent greatness of that city. At one point on the coast&nbsp;the villagers everywhere were “ soothing their wearied hearts with&nbsp;holy merriment,” and were celebrating tne festival of Osiris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Authorities.—All existing MSS. of Rutilius are later than 1494, and are copies from a lost copy of an ancient MS. once at&nbsp;the monastery of Bobio, which disappeared about 1700. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">editio princeps</span><span class="font1"> is that by J. B. Pius (Bologna, 1520), and the principal editions since have been those by Barth (1623), P. Buriran&nbsp;(1731, in his edition of the minor Latin poets), Wernsdorf (1778,&nbsp;part of a similar collection), Zumpt (i8ao), and the critical edition&nbsp;by Lucian Müller (Teubner, Leipzig, 1870), and another by Vessereau&nbsp;(1904); also an annotated edition by Keene, with a translation&nbsp;by G. F. Sa vage-Armstrong (1906). Müller writes the poet’s name&nbsp;as Claudius Rutilius Namatianus, instead of the usual Rutilius&nbsp;Claudius Namatianus; but if the identification of the poet’s&nbsp;father with the Claudius mentioned in the Theodosian Code (2,&nbsp;4, 5) be correct, Müller is probably wrong. Rutilius receives more&nbsp;or less attention from all writers on the history or literature of&nbsp;the times, but a lucid chapter in Beugnot, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire de la destruction&nbsp;du Paganisme en Occident</span><span class="font1"> (1835), may be especially mentioned,&nbsp;and one in Pichon’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Derniers écrivains profanes</span><span class="font1"> (1906).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J. S. R.)</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
