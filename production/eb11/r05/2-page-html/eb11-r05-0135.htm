<p><span class="font0">strip on the S. coast of the Crimea, where a climate similar to that of the Mediterranean coast, has permitted the' development of </span><span class="font1">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">flora closely resembling that of the valley of the Arno in Italy.&nbsp;Human cultivation has destroyed the abundant forests which sixty&nbsp;years ago made deer-hunting possible at Khersones. The olive&nbsp;and the chestnut are rare; but the beech reappears, and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pinus&nbsp;pinaster</span><span class="font0"> recalls the Italian pines. At a few points, such as Nikita&nbsp;near Livadia and Alupka, where plants have been acclimatized by&nbsp;human agency, the Californian </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Wcllingtonia,</span><span class="font0"> the Lebanon cedar,&nbsp;many evergreen trees, the laurel, the cypress, and even the Anatolian&nbsp;palm </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Chamaerops excelsa)</span><span class="font0"> flourish. The grass vegetation is very&nbsp;rich, and, according to lists still incomplete, no fewer than 1654&nbsp;flowering plants are known. But on the whole, the Crimean flora&nbsp;has little in common with that of the Caucasus.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Russia belongs to the same zoo-geographical region as central Europe and N. Asia, the same fauna extending in Siberia as far&nbsp;as the Yenisei and the Lena. In the forests not many&nbsp; animals which have disappeared from W. Europe have&nbsp;held their ground; while in the Urals only a few—now Siberian,&nbsp;but formerly also European—are met with. In S.E.. Russia,&nbsp;however, towards the Caspian, there is a notable admixture of&nbsp;Asiatic species. Three separate sub-regions may, however, be distinguished on the E. European plains—the tundras, including the&nbsp;Arctic islands, the forest region, especially the coniferous part. of&nbsp;it, and the ante-steppe and steppes of the black earth region.&nbsp;The Ural Mountains might be distinguished as a fourth sub-region,&nbsp;while the S. coast of the Crimea and Caucasia, as well as the Caspian</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">deserts, have each their own individuality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The fauna of the Arctic Ocean off the Norwegian coast corresponds, in its W. parts at least, to that of the N. Atlantic Gulf Stream. The White Sea and the Arctic Ocean to the E.of Svyatoi&nbsp;Nos on the Kola peninsula belong to a separate zoological region,&nbsp;connected with, and hardly separable from, that part of the Arctic&nbsp;Ocean which washes the Siberian coast as far as the mouth of the&nbsp;Lena. The Black Sea, the fauna of which appears to be very rich,&nbsp;belongs to the Mediterranean region, slightly modified, while the&nbsp;Caspian partakes of the characteristic fauna inhabiting the lakes&nbsp;and seas of the Aral-Caspian depression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the region of the tundras life has to contend with such unfavourable conditions that it cannot be abundant. Still, the reindeer frequents it for its lichens, and on the drier slopes of the&nbsp;moraine deposits there occur four species of lemming, hunted by&nbsp;the Arctic fox </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Vulpes Iago pus).</span><span class="font0"> The willow-grouse </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Lagopus&nbsp;albus),</span><span class="font0"> the ptarmigan (L. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">alpinus</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mutus),</span><span class="font0"> the lark, the snowbunting </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Plectrophancs nivalis),</span><span class="font0"> two or three species of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sylvia,</span><span class="font0"> one&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Phyttoscopus</span><span class="font0"> ana a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Motacilla</span><span class="font0"> must be added. Numberless aquatic&nbsp;birds visit it for breeding purposes. Ducks, divers, geese, gulls,&nbsp;all the Russian species of snipes and sandpipers </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Limicolae, Tringae),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">&amp;c., swarm on the marshes of the tundras and on the crags of the&nbsp;Lapland coast. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The forest region, and especially its coniferous portion, though it has lost some of its representatives within historic times, still&nbsp;possesses an abundant fauna. The reindeer, rapidly disappearing,&nbsp;is now met with only in the governments of Olonets and Vologda;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cervus pygargus</span><span class="font0"> is found everywhere, and reaches Novgorod. The&nbsp;weasel, the fox and the hare are exceedingly common, as also are&nbsp;the wolf and the bear in the N., but the glutton </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Gulo borealis),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the lynx and the elk </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(C. aloes)</span><span class="font0"> are rapidly disappearing. The&nbsp;wild boar is confined to the basin of the W. Dvina, and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bison&nbsp;europea</span><span class="font0"> to the Byelovyezh forest in Grodno. The sable has quite&nbsp;disappeared, being found only on the Urals; the beaver may be&nbsp;trapped at a few places in Minsk, and the otter is very rare. On&nbsp;the other hand, the hare, grey partridge </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Perdix cinerea),</span><span class="font0"> hedgehog,&nbsp;quail, lark, rook and stork find their way into the. coniferous&nbsp;region as the forests arc cleared. The avifauna of. this region is&nbsp;very rich; it includes all the forest and garden birds known in&nbsp;W. Europe, as well as a very great variety of aquatic birds. A&nbsp;list, still incomplete, of the birds of St Petersburg runs to 251&nbsp;species. Hunting and shooting give occupation to a great number&nbsp;of persons. The reptiles are few. As for fishes, all those of W.&nbsp;Europe, except the carp, are met with in the lakes and rivers in&nbsp;immense quantities, the characteristic feature of the region being&nbsp;its wealth in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Coregoni</span><span class="font0"> and in Salmonidae generally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the ante-steppe the forest species proper, such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pteromys volans</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tamias striatus,</span><span class="font0"> disappear, but common squirrel </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Sciurus&nbsp;vulgaris),</span><span class="font0"> weasel and bear are still met with in the forests. The&nbsp;hare ¡s increasing rapidly, as well as the fox. The avifauna, of&nbsp;course, becomes poorer; nevertheless, the woods of the steppe,&nbsp;and still more the forests of the ante-steppe, give refuge to many</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">birds, even to hazel-hen </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Tetrao bonasa),</span><span class="font0"> capercailzie (F. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tetrix) </span><span class="font0">and woodcock (F. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">urogallus).</span><span class="font0"> The fauna of the scrub in the river&nbsp;valleys is decidedly rich, and includes aquatic birds. The destruction of the forests and the advance of wheat into the prairies are&nbsp;rapidly thinning the steppe fauna. The various species of rapacious&nbsp;animals are disappearing, together with the colonies of marmots;&nbsp;the insectivores are also becoming scarce in consequence of the&nbsp;destruction of insects; while vermin, such as the suslik, or pouched&nbsp;marmot </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Sperrnophilus),</span><span class="font0"> and the destructive insects which arc a&nbsp;scourge to agriculture, become a real plague. The absence of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Coregoni</span><span class="font0"> is a characteristic feature of the fish-fauna of the steppes;&nbsp;the carp, on the contrary, reappears, and the rivers abound in&nbsp;sturgeon (Acipenseridae). In the Volga below Nizhniy-Novgorod&nbsp;the sturgeon </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Acipenser ruthenus),</span><span class="font0"> ana others of*the same family,&nbsp;as well as a very great variety of ganoids and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Teleostei,</span><span class="font0"> appear in&nbsp;such quantities that they give occupation to nearly 100,coo people.&nbsp;The mouths of the Caspian rivers are especially celebrated for their&nbsp;wealth of fish.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ethnography.—</span><span class="font0">Remains of Palaeolithic man, contemporary with the large Quaternary mammals, are few in Russia; they&nbsp;have been discovered only in Poland, Poltava and Voronezh,&nbsp;and perhaps also on the Oka. Those of the later Lacustrine&nbsp;period, on the contrary, are so numerous that there is scarcely&nbsp;one lacustrine basin in the regions of the Oka, the Kama, the&nbsp;Dnieper, not to speak of the lake-region itself, and even the&nbsp;White Sea coasts, where remains of Neolithic man have not been&nbsp;discovered. The Russian plains have been, however, the scene&nbsp;of so many migrations of successive races, that at many places&nbsp;a series of deposits belonging to widely distant epochs are found&nbsp;one upon another. Settlements belonging to the Stone age,&nbsp;and manufactories of stone implements, burial-grounds of the&nbsp;Bronze epoch, earthen forts and burial-mounds </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(kurgans)</span><span class="font0">—of&nbsp;this last four different types are known, the’earliest belonging&nbsp;to the Bronze period—are superposed, rendering the task of&nbsp;unravelUng their several relations one of great difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Two different races—a brachycephalic and a dolichocephalic— can be distinguished among the remains of the earlier Stone&nbsp;period (Lacustrine period) as having inhabited the plains of E.&nbsp;Europe. But they are separated by so many generations from&nbsp;the earliest historic times that sure conclusions regarding them&nbsp;are impossible; at all events, as yet Russian archaeologists are&nbsp;not agreed as to whether the ancestors of the Slavs were Sar-matians only or Scythians also, whose skulls have nothing in&nbsp;common with those of the Mongol race. The earliest </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">data&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which may be regarded as established belong to the 1st century,&nbsp;when the Finns migrated from the N. Dvina region towards&nbsp;the W., and the Sarmatians were compelled to abandon the&nbsp;region of the Don, and cross the Russian steppes from E. to W.,&nbsp;under the pressure of the Aorzes (the Mordvinian Erzya) and&nbsp;Siraks, who in their turn were soon followed by the Huns and&nbsp;Uigur-Turkish Avars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the 7th century S. Russia was the seat of the empire of the Khazars, who drove the Bulgarians, descendants of the Huns,&nbsp;from the Don, one section of them migrating up the Volga to&nbsp;found there the Bulgarian empire, and the remainder travelling&nbsp;towards the Danube. This migration compelled the N. Finns to&nbsp;advance farther W., and a body of intermingled Tavasts and&nbsp;Karelians penetrated to the S. of the Gulf of Finland.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
