<p><span class="font0">took care to ſtrengthen his party in the ſenate by adding another hundred to that body. Theſe were&nbsp;called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſenator es miηorum gentium,</span><span class="font0"> becauſe they were choſen&nbsp;out of the plebeians ; however, they had the ſame authority in the ſenate as the others, and their children&nbsp;were called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patridaηs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tarquin was not inferior to any of his predeceſſors either in his inclination or abilities to carry on a war.&nbsp;As ſoon as he aſcended the throne, he recommenced&nbsp;hoſtilities with the Latins ; from whom he took the cities of Apiolas, Cruſtuminum, Nomentum, and Collatia. The inhabitants of Apiolse were ſold for Haves ;&nbsp;but thoſe of Cruſtuminum and Nomentum, who had&nbsp;ſubmitted after their revolt, were treated with great&nbsp;clemency. The inhabitants of Collatia were diſarmed,&nbsp;and obliged to pay a large ſum of money ; the ſovereignty of it, in the mean time, being given to Egerius,&nbsp;the ſon of Arunx, Tarquin’s brother; ſrom whence he&nbsp;took the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Collatinus,</span><span class="font0"> which he tranſmitted to his&nbsp;poſterity. Corniculum, another city of Latium, was&nbsp;taken by ſtorm, and reduced to aſhes. This progreſs&nbsp;having greatly alarmed the Latins, ſeveiwl of them joined their forces in order to oppoſe ſuch a formidable&nbsp;enemy ; but being defeated in a bloody battle near Fi-denæ, they were obliged to enter into an alliance with&nbsp;Rome ; upon which the Latins having held a national&nbsp;conference, entered into a league with the Hetrurians,&nbsp;and again took the field with a very numerous army.&nbsp;But Tarquin, having defeated the confederate armies&nbsp;in two very bloody battles, obliged the Latin cities&nbsp;to ſubmit to a kind of dependence on Rome ; and,&nbsp;having entered the city in triumph, built the circus&nbsp;maximus with the ſpoils which he had taken from the&nbsp;enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The war with the Latins was ſcarce ended, when another commenced with Hetruria. This was accounted the moſt powerful nation in Italy, and was at&nbsp;that time divided into 12 tribes or lucomonies. Theſe&nbsp;appointed a national aſſembly, in which it was decreed&nbsp;that the whole force of Hetruria ſhould be employed&nbsp;againſt Tarquin ; and if any city preſumed only to&nbsp;ſtand neuter, it ſhould be for ever cut off from the national alliance. Thus a great army was raiſed, with&nbsp;which they ravaged the Roman territory, and took&nbsp;Fidenæ by the treachery of ſome of its inhabitants.&nbsp;Tarquin, not being in a condition to oppoſe them at&nbsp;firſt, was obliged to ſubmit to jthe loſs occaſioned by&nbsp;their ravages for a whole year ; after which he took&nbsp;the field with all the forces he could raiſe. The Roman army was divided into two bodies, one under the&nbsp;king himſelf, the other commanded by his nephew&nbsp;Collatinus. The latter, having divided his forces in&nbsp;order to plunder the country, was defeated ; but Tarquin, in two engagements, vanquiſhed the army which&nbsp;oppoſed him. He then marched againſt Fidenæ, where&nbsp;he gained a third battle ; after which he took the city.&nbsp;Such of the citizens as were ſuſpected to have been&nbsp;concerned in betraying ſt to the enemy were whipped&nbsp;to death ; the reſt were ſent into baniſhment, and their ∙&nbsp;lands divided by lot among the Roman ſoldiers. Tarquin now haſtened to oppoſe the new army of the&nbsp;Hetrurians before their forces could be properly collected ; and having come up with them at Ereturn, a&nbsp;place about jo miles from Rome, defeated them with&nbsp;great ſlaughter, ſor which victory he was decreed a</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">triumph by the ſenate </span><span class="font1">5 </span><span class="font0">while the enemy, dlſlteartened by ſo many misfortunes, were glad to ſue for peace ;&nbsp;which Tarquin readily granted, upon the ſole condition of their owning his ſuperiorſty over them. In&nbsp;compliance with this, the Hetrurians ſent him all the,&nbsp;enſigns of royalty which were in uſe among them, viz.&nbsp;a crown of gold, a throne of ivory, a ſceptre with&nbsp;an eagle on the top of it, a tunic embroidered with&nbsp;gold, and adorned with figures of palm branches, together with a purple robe enriched with flowers of&nbsp;ſeveral colours. Tarquin, however, would not wear&nbsp;theſe magnificent ornaments till ſuch time as the ſenate&nbsp;and people had conſented to it by an expreſs law.&nbsp;He then applied the regalia to the decoration of his&nbsp;triumph, and never afterwards laid them aſide. In&nbsp;this triumph he appeared in a gilt chariot, drawn by&nbsp;four horſes, clothed in a purple robe, and a tunic embroidered with gold, a crown on his head, and a ſceptre&nbsp;in his hand, attended by 12 liétors with their axes and&nbsp;faſees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tarquin, having now obtained ſome reſpite from war, applied himſelf to the beautifying and ornamenting the city. He built the walls of Rome with hewn&nbsp;ſtone, and erected thoſe famous common ſewers which&nbsp;have deſervedly been accounted one of the wonders of&nbsp;the world. Rome at this time contained four hills&nbsp;within its compaſt, viz. the Palatinus, Tarpeius, Qui-rinalis, and Cœlius. In the valleys between theſe hills,&nbsp;the rain-water and ſprings uniting, formed great pools&nbsp;which laid under water the ſtreets and public places.&nbsp;The mud likewiſe made the way impaſſable, infected&nbsp;the air, and rendered the city unhealthy. Tarquin&nbsp;undertook to free the city from this nuiſance, by conveying off theſe waters by ſubterraneous channels into&nbsp;the Tiber. In doing this, it was neceſſary to cut thro*&nbsp;hills and rocks a channel large enough for a navigable&nbsp;ſtream, and covered with arches ſtrong enough to bear&nbsp;the weight of houſes, which were frequently built upon&nbsp;them, and ſtood as firm as on the moſt ſolid foundations. All theſe arches were made of hard ſtone, and&nbsp;neither trouble nor expence were ſpared to make the&nbsp;work durable. Their height and bιeadth were ſo conſiderable, that a cart loaded with hay could eaſily paſs&nbsp;through them under ground. The expence of con-ſtructing theſe ſewers was never ſo thoroughly underſtood as when it became neceſſary to repair them ; for&nbsp;then the cenſors gave no leſs than 1000 talents to the&nbsp;perſen appointed for this purpoſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Beſides theſe great works, Tarquin adorned the forum, ſurrounding it with galleries in which were ſhops for tradeſmen, and building temples in it for the youth&nbsp;of both ſexes, and halls ſor the adminiſtration of public juſtice. He next engaged in a war with the Sabines, on pretence that they had aſſiſted the Hetrurians. Both armies took the field, and came to an&nbsp;engagement on the confines of Sabinia, without any&nbsp;conſiderable advantage on either ſide ; neither was any&nbsp;thing-of conſequence done during the whole campaign.&nbsp;Tarquin then, conſidering with himſelf that the Roman forces were very deficient in cavalry, reſolved to&nbsp;add ſome new bodies of knights to thoſe already inſtituted by Romulus. But this project met with great&nbsp;oppoſition from the ſuperſtitious augurs, as the original diviſion of horſe into three bodies had been determined by auguries ; and Actius Nævius, the chief of</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
