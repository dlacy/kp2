        <p><span class="font0">What was the effect of this procedure? The question is one not easily
                answered. Brinz expressed the opinion that the creditor&nbsp;was entitled in virtue
                of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">nexum</span><span
                class="font0"> to take his debtor into custody&nbsp;at any time when he considered
                such a course necessary for his&nbsp;own protection, even before the conventional
                term of repayment—&nbsp;that the debtor was in bonds, virtually a pledge, from the
                very&nbsp;first, and the tightness or looseness of them a matter in the discretion
                of his creditor.<sup>@@1</sup> Voigt holds that the </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">nexum</span><span class="font0"> did not give&nbsp;the
                creditor any peculiar hold over his debtor, and that on the&nbsp;latter’s failure to
                repay an ordinary action was necessary, to be&nbsp;followed by the usual proceedings
                in execution if judgment was&nbsp;in favour of the former. These views may be said
                to be the two&nbsp;extremes; and between them lie a.good many others, more or
                less&nbsp;divergent. The difficulty of arriving at a conclusion is caused
                to&nbsp;some extent by the ambiguity of the words </span><span class="font0"

                difficult, sometimes impossible, to&nbsp;be sure in which sense they use the word.
                It is therefore not surprising that there should be considerable diversity of
                opinion on the&nbsp;subject.<sup>@@2</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Since Huschke, the great majority of writers—Voigt<sup>@@3</sup> Lend
                and Mitteis are distinguished exceptions—concur in opinion that&nbsp;the nexal
                contract entitled the creditor, after expiry of thirty&nbsp;days from the
                conventional date of repayment of the loan, to proceed&nbsp;against his debtor by

                servile treatment, until the&nbsp;loan was repaid. The parallel of such a course is
                to be met with&nbsp;amongst many ancient nations—Jews, Greeks,
                Scandinavians,&nbsp;Germans, &amp;c.<sup>@@4</sup> And it was not altogether
                unreasonable. If a&nbsp;borrower had already exhausted all available means of
                raising&nbsp;money, had sold or mortgaged everything he possessed of any&nbsp;value,
                what other course was open to him in his necessity except to&nbsp;impledge himself?
                That the creditor should have been entitled to&nbsp;realize the right he had thus
                acquired without the judgment on&nbsp;it of a court of law is equally intelligible.
                It was just a case of&nbsp;regulated self-help. The nexal contract was a public act,
                carried&nbsp;out in the presence of the five citizen witnesses and </span><span
                class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">libripens,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0"
                >who were witnesses alike of the acknowledgment of indebtedness&nbsp;and of the
                tacit engagement of the debtor. The only valid objection apparently that could be
                stated against the creditor’s apprehension of his debtor in execution was that the
                indebtedness no&nbsp;longer existed—that the loan had been repaid. But a nexal
                debt</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">could be legally discharged only by </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">nexi liberatio,</span><span class="font0"> which also was

                libram</span><span class="font0"> in the presence of five citizen&nbsp;witnesses.
                What need for a judicial inquiry in the presence of facts&nbsp;so notorious? A

                to give opportunity for such proof, if there was room for it, that the XI1.
                Tables&nbsp;required that a creditor who had apprehended a nexal debtor
                should&nbsp;bring him into court before carrying him off into detention.</span></p>

                addiction of the debtor after sixty days, with power to kill or&nbsp;sell into
                slavery after addiction, are disputed questions, but there&nbsp;seems no good reason
                for distinguishing a nexal from a </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">judicatus&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">debtor in these
                respects. Untenable is the notion at any rate that&nbsp;the </span><span

                position than one condemned for a judgment debt, of whom Quintilian states
                distinctly that he still&nbsp;retained his position in the census and in his tribe.
                Many a time&nbsp;when the exigencies of the state required it, were the </span><span

                as citizens. The nexal debtor’s position after&nbsp;arrest in regard to his family
                rights is obscure. If originally they&nbsp;shared his nexal condition, this did not
                long continue to be the&nbsp;law. If he was a house-father he seemingly still

                was&nbsp;the body of his debtor that the creditor was entitled to, and
                too&nbsp;often he wreaked his vengeance on it by way of punishment;&nbsp;there was
                as yet no machinery for attaching the debtor’s goods&nbsp;in substantial reparation
                for the loss caused by his breach of contract.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The abuses to which this system of personal execution gave rise were
                great. Livy tells us that in the year 428 u.c. (326 B.c.) a&nbsp;more than
                ordinarily flagrant outrage committed by a&nbsp;creditor upon one of his young
                </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">nexi,</span><span
                class="font0"> who had given himself up as responsible for a loan contracted by his
                deceased&nbsp;father, roused the populace to such a pitch of indignation as
                to&nbsp;necessitate instant remedial legislation. The result was the Poetilian law
                </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Lex Poetilia
                Papiria).</span><span class="font0"> So far as can be gathered from the&nbsp;meagre
                accounts of it we possess, it contained at least these three&nbsp;provisions—(1)
                that fetters and neck, arm or foot blocks should in&nbsp;future be applied only to
                persons undergoing imprisonment for&nbsp;crime or delict; (2) that no one should
                ever again be the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"

                >nexi</span><span class="font0"> should be released. The first was intended to
                prevent unnecessary restraint upon judgment-debtors formally given over
                to&nbsp;their enditors. The second did not necessarily abolish the contract of Ioan
                </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">per aes et libram,</span><span
                class="font0"> but only what had hitherto been an&nbsp;</span><span class="font0"

                done against a&nbsp;borrower only as a judgment-debtor formally made over to his
                creditor&nbsp;by magisterial decree, and under the restrictions and
                limitations&nbsp;imposed by the Poetilian law itself. This very soon led to
                the&nbsp;disuse of nexal obligation; once it was deprived of its
                distinctive&nbsp;processual advantages it rapidly gave place to the simpler
