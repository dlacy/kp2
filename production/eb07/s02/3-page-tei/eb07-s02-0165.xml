The college of the Jesuits, since converted into the inquisition, is a most beautiful pile of building, with a handsome church, a hall of judgment, and various cells for the reception of prisoners.</p><p>This city abounds in convents, monasteries, and other religious establishments, most of them richly endowed; and their chapels are the repositories of the finest specimens of the art of painting, at the period which produced better artists in Spain than in any other part of Europe. The works of the native artists Murillo, Velasquez, Zubaran, Spanioletti, Morales, Cano, and others, as well as of Titian, Rubens, Michel Angelo, and other foreigners, are preserved in the cathedral, and in several of the other churches, chapels, and convents.</p><p>There is a university, though the building is gloomy and tasteless, and the professors neither enlightened or learned ; the number of pupils is very considerable, and most of them are destined for the ecclesiastical profession. It is said that two thirds of the houses in this city are either the property of the cathedral or other ecclesiastical bodies, who receive the rents of them in some cases weekly, and in others monthly.</p><p>In this city the edifices belonging to the government are numerous and extensive. The mint is one of them, in which the whole process of coining money is conducted. There is a foundery for cannon, a manufactory for muskets, swords, and other military accoutrements; but the largest establishment is the manufactory of tobacco, which, being a royal monopoly, can be sold only by the crown, either in the form of snuff, or in cigars or smaller particles for smoking.</p><p>The manufactures of this city are not great in proportion to the whole number of the population. But a large proportion of the inhabitants are ecclesiastics ; and a much larger portion are paupers, who have no inducement to work, because they can obtain bare necessaries by going the rounds of different convents, where food is gratuitously bestowed on them, or by receiving from the episcopal palace a share of the alms which are daily dispensed. There are, however, fifteen hundred looms employed in making silk goods of various descriptions. Very little silk is raised in the vicinity of the city, it being principally drawn from Valencia and Murcia, where mulberry-trees abound. There are some manufactories of cloths, serges, hats, stockings, and other more minute articles- There is a very extensive establishment for currying leather, and every part of the process, from the first currying to the conversion into boots, shoes, saddles, bridles, gloves, and other articles, is carried on upon a large scale. The bark of the cork-trees is used for tanning, which, though not so strong as the common oak-bark, is yet in larger quantities found to be equally efficacious.</p><p>The foreign trade of Seville is but small, the harbour of Cadiz being more commodious for large vessels. The principal exports are, oil, goat and kid skins, quicksilver, liquorice, shumac, cork, and olives. The imports are almost wholly made through Cadiz.</p><p>The streets of Seville are in general so narrow as to forbid the passage of carriages through most of them ; and some, in which frequently the best houses are to be found, are so close, that a person standing in the middle and extending both arms may touch the walls on the opposite sides. There is, however, what compensates for this, a fine public walk on the banks of the Guadalquivir, where all that is fashionable of the city may be seen enjoying the cool of the evening. This city was the birthplace of the Emperors Trajan, Adrian, and Theodosius; of Juan de la Cueva, of Diego Velasquez de Silva, and of Francis de Herrara. It is situated in long. 5.18. W. and lot. 37. 24. N.</p><p>SEVRES, <hi rend="smallcaps">Deux,</hi> a department of France, formed out of the ancient province of the Lower Poitou. It extends from 1. 37. east, to 0. 8. west longitude, and from 46. 0. to 47. 12. north latitude. It is bounded on the north by the department of the Maine and Loire, on the east by that of Vienne, on the south by the Charente, on the south-west by the Lower Charente, and on the west by Vendée. It comprehends 2135<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">5</hi> square miles, or 607,350 hectares, equal to 1,366,538 English acres. In 1834, of this land, 369,297 hectares were under the plough, 18,896 were vineyards, 7280 gardens, 17,466 moors, heaths, pasture, &amp;c., 29,806 woods, and the remainder the sites of towns, rivers, morasses, and uncultivated lands. It is divided into four arrondissements, thirty-one cantons, and 356 communes. Its population in 1836 amounted to 304,105. The surface is generally level, except that a chain of hills, the highest point of which does not exceed 450 feet, extends through the department from north-west to south-east. The chief rivers are the two streams from whence the department takes its name. The Sèvres-Nantaise receives the waters of the Louine and the Chambron, and passes into Vendée ; and the Sèvres-Niortaise rcceives the streams Lamdon and Guerande, and becomes navigable at Niort, and then enters Vendée. There are a great number of smaller streams, most of which reach the sea by the Loire. The agriculture is in a backward state, the oxen arc used for the plough, and much of the land is in fallow. The greater part of the cultivators are metayers, dividing the produce with the proprietors. The fertility is such that nearly one half the corn grown is supplied to other districts; and much hay and clover are furnished to the departments that are contiguous. The manufacturing industry is almost exclusively confined to providing necessaries for home consumption. The breed of horses is good, and many of them, as well as of a strong breed of asses, and some mules, are articles of commerce. The only mines are of iron, the ore of which is sent into Charente to be manufactured. There are quarries from which excellent millstones are obtained. The department elects two deputies to the legislative chamber. The capital is the city of Niort, with a population in 1836 of 18,197.</p><p>SEWAD, an extensive district in Afghanistan, situated about the thirty-fourth degree of north latitude, and partly bounded by the Indus. The country rises to a great elevation, consisting of snow-clad mountains, interspersed with fertile valleys producing all the finest fruits of Europe. It is about seventy miles in length by forty in breadth, and contains twenty-five valleys, each watered by a separate stream. It is principally inhabited by the tribe of the Yusufzies, who, taking advantage of the difficult passes and strong situations abounding in the country, have not only held themselves independent of the Mogul sovereigns, but have made inroads into their territories. They are a brave and independent people, ready to contribute their quota of troops to any plundering expedition, or in defence of the country.</p><p>SEWALIC <hi rend="smallcaps">Mountains</hi>. This chain of mountains, which reaches a considerable elevation, divides the province of Delhi from Serinagur, in Northern Hindustan. It is through these mountains that the Ganges enters on the plains of Hindustan, at a place called Hurdwar. The hills, which rise with a moderate though unequal slope from the plains, are skirted with deep forests, which abound with valuable timber, and afford shelter to elephants. These, however, seldom exceed seven feet in height, and hence are not considered so valuable as those caught nearer the sea.</p><p>SEWAN, a town of Hindustan, province of Bahar, sixty- six miles north-west from Patna. Long. 84. 25. E. Lat. 26. 11. N.</p><p>SEWEE, a district in the province of Beloochistan, situated about the thirty-first degree of north latitude, and bounded on the east by a mountainous ridge of hard black rock.</p></body></text></TEI>
