. A circle in the Austrian province of Dalmatia, composed of what was formerly the independent state of that name, of the peninsula of Sabioncello, and of several islands on the shores of the Adriatic. It was formerly an aristocratical republic, with the peasants feudatories to the nobles ; and its constitution was under the guarantee of the Sultan, of the king of the two Sicilies, and of the republic of Venice. When, in the course of the war, the French took possession of the district, the bondage of the labourers was lightened, and when it was ceded to Austria by the congress of Vienna in 1815, the freedom of all was secured. The circle is 1232 square miles in extent, and contains about 50,000 inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same name, the Rausium of antiquity. It is situated in a small bay which forms an excellent haven, from being protected by the island of St. Locromo.
