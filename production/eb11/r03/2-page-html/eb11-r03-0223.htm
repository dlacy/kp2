<p><span class="font0">too much; it clung as closely as Napoleon himself to the idea of a State Church, taking its orders from the government. In&nbsp;this way Gallicanism, which had once stood for all that was&nbsp;national and progressive, now came to mean subservience to a&nbsp;feeble autocracy already tottering to its fall. “ A free Church&nbsp;in a free State ” became the motto of the group of brilliant men,&nbsp;led by Lamennais, Montalembert and Lacordaire, who started&nbsp;up as soon as the July Revolution of 1830 replaced Charles X.&nbsp;by Louis Philippe. They felt that Catholicism was strong&nbsp;enough to stand alone, without artificial support. For the&nbsp;Revolution had not “ abolished Christianity,” even among&nbsp;the educated classes, quite so thoroughly as it imagined. Many&nbsp;were only kept back from going to church by the fear that their&nbsp;neighbours would think them superstitious or narrow-minded.&nbsp;But in 1802 Chateaubriand had published his epoch-making&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Génie du Christianisme,</span><span class="font0"> in which he declared that of all religions&nbsp;Christianity was “ the most poetical, the most human, the&nbsp;most favourable to freedom, art and letters.” If that were so,&nbsp;no one need be ashamed to profess it; and the younger generation of Frenchmen began to gravitate back to the Church.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Germany was being profoundly influenced by the&nbsp;great aesthetic revival known as the Romantic Movement,&nbsp;which began with the worship of medieval art and literature,&nbsp;and ended with the worship of medieval religion. And even&nbsp;Italy and Spain presently began to play their part in the&nbsp;Christian reaction. Rosmini in one country, and Balmes in&nbsp;the other, “ brought piety to the learned, and learning to&nbsp;the pious.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These writers, however, only touched the few; and the great aim of Lamennais and his friends was to reach the mass&nbsp;of the people. Immediately after the accession of Louis&nbsp;Philippetheystartedtheirfamousnewspaper, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">L<sup>1</sup>Avenir,</span><span class="font0"> hoping&nbsp;thereby to reconcile the Church with democracy, and make&nbsp;the pope the leader of the party of progress. The enterprise&nbsp;was hazardous, since democracy had hitherto brought nothing&nbsp;but ill to Rome. In 1798 French troops had entered the papal&nbsp;states, proclaimed a republic in Rome, and kept Pius VI. a&nbsp;prisoner till his death (1799). In 1808 Napoleon arrested his&nbsp;successor, Pius VII., threw the papal states into his new Italian&nbsp;kingdom, and dragged Pius about from prison to prison till&nbsp;the eve of his own fall in 1814. When the congress of Vienna&nbsp;gave the pope back his dominions, the one thought of the&nbsp;broken old man was to restore, as far as possible, the ancient&nbsp;order of things. But the traditional methods of Roman administration were deplorably ineffective; on the accession of&nbsp;Gregory XVI. (1831-46), the powers presented a memorandum&nbsp;strongly urging reform. Some reforms of detail were introduced; but Gregory declared that to grant a constitution to&nbsp;the States of the Church would be incompatible with the principle of the papacy. Such a man was hardly likely to listen&nbsp;to the plans of Lamennais. In 1832 the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Avenir</span><span class="font0"> was condemned, and the disgusted Lamennais left the Roman Church.&nbsp;Lacordaire and Montalembert, however, continued their democratic campaign, by no means without success; for the&nbsp;revolution of 1848, which drove Louis Philippe from the throne,&nbsp;was far less hostile to Catholicism than that of'1830. Under&nbsp;the short-lived Second Republic (1848-52) the position of the&nbsp;Church grew even stronger, for the introduction of universal&nbsp;suffrage brought to the polls great masses of new voters&nbsp;strongly clerical in sympathies. In 1850 was passed the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Loi Falloux,</span><span class="font0"> which broke down the Napoleonic idea of a&nbsp;state-monopoly of teaching, and allowed the opening of&nbsp;voluntary schools. Of this concession the religious orders&nbsp;took full advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meanwhile in Rome things had gone from bad to worse. Gregory XVIJs refusal to grant a constitution called forth a&nbsp;series of sporadic outbursts, inspired by Mazzini and the&nbsp;“ Young Italian ” party, between 1832 and 1838. These were&nbsp;put down by French and Austrian arms, with the result of&nbsp;focusing the hatred of Young Italy on the pope. One last’&nbsp;attempt was made to save him. In 1843 the Piedmontese&nbsp;priest Gioberti brought out a remarkable book, in which he&nbsp;urged his countrymen to combine into an Italian confederation&nbsp;with the pope at its head. For a moment it seemed as though&nbsp;Giobcrti’s dream were about to translate itself into reality. In&nbsp;1846 Gregory died, and was succeeded by Pius IX., one of the&nbsp;youngest of the cardinals, and well known for his popular&nbsp;sympathies. Hc at once granted an amnesty to political&nbsp;prisoners, of whom the Roman gaols were full; two years later&nbsp;(March 1848) he issued a constitution to the papal states, and&nbsp;seemed about to throw in his lot with the forces making for&nbsp;Italian independence. But the first step thereto was deliverance from the Austrian yoke; and Pius, the Italian prince, was&nbsp;grievously hampered by his position as head of the Church.&nbsp;How could a pope make war on Austria* the one power that had&nbsp;never faltered in its allegiance to the Church? Accordingly&nbsp;Pius soon drew back, and his popularity waned. In the&nbsp;autumn the revolutionary fever, which had swept through all&nbsp;Europe earlier in the year, spread to Rome. The pope’s prime&nbsp;minister, Count Rossi, was murdered, and Pius himself, escaping&nbsp;to Gaeta, threw himself under Neapolitan protection. In Rome&nbsp;Mazzini proclaimed a republic. Once more France and Austria&nbsp;intervened; in 1850 Pius went back to Rome, and ruled there&nbsp;under the shadow of foreign bayonets. Meanwhile the Second&nbsp;Republic had come to an end in France; in 1852 the prince-president, Louis Napoleon, was elected emperor. At first he&nbsp;greatly needed the support of the clergy to secure him on his&nbsp;precarious throne. But, as he grew stronger, his desire for their&nbsp;good opinion paled before an overmastering propensity to&nbsp;meddle in the affairs of foreign nations. He allied himself with&nbsp;Victor Emmanuel, and marched into Italy in 1859, with the&nbsp;object of expelling the Austrians from the peninsula. This&nbsp;expedition led directly up to the unification of Italy. Two&nbsp;years later Victor Emmanuel was master of the whole country,&nbsp;except Venice and the “ Patrimony of St Peter.” This last—&nbsp;about one-third of the papal states—was all that was left to&nbsp;Pius; and even this was only held for him by French troops.&nbsp;When Napoleon withdrew his garrison in 1866, Garibaldi immediately raised a body of volunteers to march on Rome; and&nbsp;Napoleon was obliged to send back his troops. Three&nbsp;years later, the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War&nbsp;(July 1870) led to their recall. In the following&nbsp;September, ten days after the final collapse of Louis&nbsp;Napoleon at Sédan, the troops of Victor Emmanuel entered&nbsp;Rome; and the temporal power of Pius came to an&nbsp;end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Pius might no longer rule over the papal states; but there was consolation in the thought that, within the realm of conscience, his power had increased by leaps and bounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The whole history of the 19th century is one vast conspiracy to exalt the importance of the papacy. At&nbsp;its opening both the intellectual and administrative guidance&nbsp;of the Church was entirely in French and Italian hands; and&nbsp;the first instincts of those countries is to lean on an all-sufficing&nbsp;government. The French Revolution had supposed itself to be&nbsp;fighting for the “ rights of man ”; really it was trying to replace&nbsp;an autocratic kingship by an equally autocratic “general wall”&nbsp;of the multitude. And it failed because no general will could&nbsp;make its voice rise above the conflict of particular inclinations.&nbsp;Thankfully did men bow before Napoleon, who undertook to&nbsp;relieve them of the responsibility of having to make up their&nbsp;minds. Nor did the emperor’s fall by any means entail the fall&nbsp;of his ideas; Count Joseph de Maistre, the great orator of&nbsp;Ultramontanism, did little more than transplant them on to&nbsp;the ecclesiastical domain. Bossuct and the old-fashioned&nbsp;divines had believed in an elaborate system of checks and&nbsp;balances—popes, councils, bishops, temporal sovereigns each&nbsp;limiting and controlling the other—just as Montesquieu and&nbsp;Alexander Hamilton had believed in a careful separation of&nbsp;the executive from the legislative power. Napoleon swept&nbsp;away the checks and balances, and made the will of a single&nbsp;man the one and only sanction of government. Ic like manner&nbsp;de Maistre proposed to sweep away the ecclesiastical checks&nbsp;and balances, and vest the whole of the Church’s authority in</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
