<p><span class="font0">retired from the directorate in London. Jameson was, on the 9th of January 1896, officially removed from his office of&nbsp;administrator of the company’s territories, and was succeeded&nbsp;by Earl Grey. Just at this time rinderpest made its appearance&nbsp;in southern Rhodesia, carrying off large herds of cattle, and&nbsp;this was followed in March 1896 by a revolt of the Matabele,&nbsp;while in June the Mashona also rebelled. The occasion, but&nbsp;not the cause, of the Matabele rising was the withdrawal of&nbsp;the greater part of the company’s force to take part in the&nbsp;Jameson Raid. The Matabele had various grievances, chiefly&nbsp;that after the war of 1893 they were treated as a conquered&nbsp;people. All able-bodied young men were required to work&nbsp;for the white farmers and miners a certain number of months&nbsp;per annum at a fixed rate of pay—a most irksome regulation,&nbsp;enforced, on occasions, by the native police in a tyrannical&nbsp;fashion. Another grievance was the seizure by the company,&nbsp;after the death of Lobengula, of the cattle of the Matabele—&nbsp;their chief source of wealth. Not only was there a first confiscation after the war, but subsequently there was a periodical&nbsp;taking away of cattle in small numbers—the company acting&nbsp;under the belief that nearly all the cattle in Matabeleland&nbsp;belonged to the king and were therefore lawfully theirs. However, before the end of 1895 the company had settled the question in agreement with the indunas, two-fifths of the cattle&nbsp;to go to the company and the remainder to become the absolute&nbsp;property of the natives. But it was neither the action of the&nbsp;company in the confiscation of cattle, nor the Labour regulations,&nbsp;that induced the mass of the people to rebel; they were induced&nbsp;to act by chiefs who chafed under their loss of power and&nbsp;position and imagined themselves strong enough to&nbsp;throw off the yoke of the conquerors. In the manner&nbsp;customary among savages the Matabcle began hostilities by the murder of defenceless white settlers—men,&nbsp;women and children. Bulawayo was threatened, and soon all&nbsp;the country south of the Zambezi was in a state of rebellion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Imperial troops under Sir Frederick Carrington were hurried up to the assistance of such police as the British South Africa&nbsp;Company still had at its command. Volunteers were enrolled,&nbsp;and much fierce fighting followed. Rhodes hastened to Bulawayo, and after conferences with the military and other authorities he determined to go, with Dr Hans Sauer and Mr J. Colen-brander, a well-known hunter and pioneer intimately acquainted&nbsp;with the natives, and interview the chiefs. They went (September&nbsp;1896) unarmed into the heart of the Matoppo Hills, and there&nbsp;arranged terms of peace with the indunas. The interview&nbsp;involved grave danger to the emissaries, and depended for&nbsp;its success entirely upon Rhodes’s personality and influence&nbsp;over the native races, but it terminated what promised to be&nbsp;a long and disastrous native war. The Matabele, whose&nbsp;legitimate grievances were acknowledged and met, ceased the&nbsp;war after the indaba with Rhodes; the Mashona revolt continued, and was not finally crushed until October 1897, though&nbsp;all danger to settlers was over six months previously. At&nbsp;this time the rinderpest had carried off nearly all the cattle in&nbsp;the country—a disaster which, together with the destruction of&nbsp;grain during the war, had brought the natives almost to starvation—and steps had to be taken to supply their needs. Many&nbsp;of the white settlers too were reduced to sore straits and required assistance. The rebelllons had cost the company fully&nbsp;£2,500,000, and to meet the debt incurred an additional capital&nbsp;of £1,500,000 was raised in 1898. At the meeting of the company in April 1898, at which this step was taken, Rhodes was&nbsp;re-elected a director.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The events of 1896—the Jameson Raid and the rebellions— caused the imperial government to remodel the constitution of&nbsp;Rhodesia. The armed forces of the company had already&nbsp;been placed under the direct control of the crown, and on the&nbsp;20th of October 1898 an order in council was passed providing&nbsp;for the future regulation of the country. An imperial resident&nbsp;commissioner was appointed, who was also to be ex </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">officio&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">a member of the executive and legislative councils; and there&nbsp;was to be a legislative council, consisting of five nominated&nbsp;and four elected members. The first meeting of the newly&nbsp;appointed council took place at Salisbury on the 15th of May&nbsp;1899.' Other changes, in the direction of giving more power&nbsp;to the non-official element, were made subsequently (see above,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Administration).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While these political changes were being made the company and the settlers set to work to repair the losses by war and&nbsp;plague. In particular the policy of railway development was&nbsp;pushed forward, and in November 1897 the line from Cape&nbsp;Town reached Bulawayo. The Mashonaland railway connecting&nbsp;Salisbury with Beira was completed in May 1899. In the&nbsp;same year gold-mining on a considerable scale began, the&nbsp;output for the year being over 65,000 oz. In the early part&nbsp;of 1899 Rhodes visited London and Berlin in furtherance of&nbsp;his schemes for the transcontinental telegraph extension&nbsp;from Cape Town to Cairo, and the transcontinental railway.&nbsp;He endeavoured to obtain from the British Government the&nbsp;guarantee of a loan for extending the railway, to be raised&nbsp;at 3% hut was unsuccessful. He received, however, the&nbsp;support of various companies in Rhodesia, who amongst them&nbsp;subscribed £252,800 at 3% for the immediate extension of&nbsp;the railway for 150 miles; and in May he stated, at a meeting&nbsp;of the Chartered Company, that the Rhodesia Railways&nbsp;Limited would raise another £3,000,000 at 4%, to be guaranteed&nbsp;by the Chartered Company. In this way he hoped that the&nbsp;remaining 1050 miles of railway from Bulawayo to the frontier&nbsp;of German East Africa might be constructed. In Berlin,&nbsp;Rhodes had an interview with the German Emperor, when&nbsp;arrangements were arrived at for the passage of telegraph&nbsp;lines over German territory, and also in certain contingencies&nbsp;for the continuation of the transcontinental railway through&nbsp;German East Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In many respects the country recovered rapidly from the disasters of 1896, one of the most important measures taken&nbsp;being the compulsory inoculation for rinderpest, which finally&nbsp;stamped out the disease in 1898-99. By the last balance-sheet issued by the company previous to the outbreak of the&nbsp;Boer War it would appear that the revenue of Rhodesia for&nbsp;the year ending the 31st of March 1898 amounted to £260,516&nbsp;net, of which amount the sale of land plots accounts for&nbsp;£63,628; stamps and licences, £69,658; and posts and&nbsp;telegraphs, £46,745; so that the machinery of civilized life&nbsp;was already in full activity where eight years previously the&nbsp;only white inhabitants had been a few missionaries, hunters&nbsp;and traders. The government buildings were estimated in&nbsp;March 1898 to be worth £165,672, and the assessed value of&nbsp;the town property at Bulawayo was £2,045,000 and that at&nbsp;Salisbury £750,000. (Both those towns had been granted&nbsp;municipal government in 1897.) Education was arranged under&nbsp;the supervision of government inspectors, and various religious&nbsp;communities were also engaged in educational work. The&nbsp;country appeared indeed in 1899 to be starting on the road to&nbsp;industrial and agricultural prosperity, but an almost complete&nbsp;stop to progress resulted from the outbreak of the Boer War&nbsp;in October of that year. The company could point w*ith&nbsp;satisfaction to the fact that Rhodesia contributed nearly&nbsp;1500 men to the forces serving in the war, i2|% of the&nbsp;European population. Rhodesia itself was not subjected to&nbsp;invasion, but the withdrawal of so large a number of able-bodied men seriously interfered w’ith the development of the&nbsp;country, the war not ending until June 1902. Throughout&nbsp;this period the natives, with few exceptions, remained peaceful&nbsp;and gave the administration no serious trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Before the war ended, Cecil Rhodes, whose chief work during the period since the Raid had been the building up of the&nbsp;country which bore his name, was dead (26th of&nbsp;March 1902). Alfred Beit, who had in 1898 refused&nbsp;to rejoin the directorate, now consented (June 1902)&nbsp;to return to the board of the Chartered Company,&nbsp;on which he remained until his death in July 1906. The&nbsp;loss of Rhodes’s guiding mind and inspiring personality was,&nbsp;however, manifest, and among the Rhodesians there arose</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
