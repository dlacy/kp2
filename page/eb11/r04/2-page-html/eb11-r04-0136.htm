                was of necessity gradual; but it&nbsp;had its beginnings under Augustus, who formed
                the&nbsp;equestrian order (admission to which was henceforth&nbsp;granted only by
                him) into an imperial service, partly&nbsp;civil and partly military, whose members,
                being immediately dependent on the emperor, could be employed&nbsp;on tasks which it
                would have heen impossible to assign&nbsp;to senators (see </span><span

                From this order were drawn&nbsp;the armies of “ procurators ”—the term was derived
                from&nbsp;the practice of the great business houses of Rome—who administered the
                imperial revenues and properties in all parts of&nbsp;the empire. Merit was rewarded
                by independent governorships such as those of Raetia and Noricum, or the command of
                the naval squadrons at Misenum and Ravenna;&nbsp;and the prizes of the knight’s
                career were the prefectures&nbsp;of the praetorian guard, the corn-supply and the
                city police,&nbsp;and the governorship of Egypt. The household offices
                and&nbsp;imperial secretaryships were held hy freedmen, almost always&nbsp;of Greek
                origin, whose influence became all-powerful under such&nbsp;emperors as

                modest household and&nbsp;simple, life of Augustus were replaced by a more
                than&nbsp;regal splendour, and under Nero we find all the outward accessories of
                monarchy present, the palace, the palace&nbsp;guards, the crowds of courtiers, and a

                >princeps</span><span class="font1"> himself.&nbsp;The logical conclusion was
                reached in the practice of Caesar-worship,@@<sup>5 </sup>which was in origin the
                natural expression of a widespread sentiment of homage, which varied in form in
                different&nbsp;parts of the empire and in different classes of society, but
                was&nbsp;turned to account by the statecraft of Augustus to develop&nbsp;something
                like an imperial patriotism. The official worship of&nbsp;the deified Caesar,
                starting from that of the “ divine Julius,”&nbsp;gave a certain sanctity and
                continuity to the regular succession&nbsp;of the emperors, but it was of less
                importance politically than&nbsp;the worship of “ Rome and Augustus,” first
                instituted in Asia&nbsp;Minor in 29 </span><span class="font0"

                throughout the provinces,&nbsp;as a symbol of imperial unity. It must be observed

            <p><span class="font1">On the accession of Augustus, there could be little doubt as to
                    the nature of the work that was necessary, if peace and prosperity were to be
                    secured for the Roman world. He was called&nbsp;upon to justify his position by
                    rectifying the frontiers and&nbsp;strengthening their defences, by reforming the
                    system of provincial government, and hy reorganizing the finance; and
                    his&nbsp;success in dealing with these three difficult problems is
                    sufficiently&nbsp;proved hy the prosperous condition of the empire for a
                    century&nbsp;and a half after his death. To secure peace it was necessary
                    to&nbsp;establish on all sides of the empire really defensible&nbsp;frontiers;
                    and this became possible now that for the&nbsp;first time the direction of the
                    foreign policy of the state&nbsp;and of its military forces was concentrated in
                    the hands of a&nbsp;single magistrate. To the south and west the generals of the
                    republic, and Caesar himself, had extended the authority of Rome&nbsp;to the
                    natural boundaries formed by the African deserts and&nbsp;the Atlantic Ocean,
                    and in these two directions Augustus’s task&nbsp;was in the main confined to the
                    organization of a settled Roman&nbsp;government within these limits. In Africa
                    the client state of&nbsp;Egypt was ruled by Augustus as the successor of the
                    Ptolemies,&nbsp;and administered by his deputies </span><span class="font1"

                    them. The result@@<sup>9</sup> of Augustus’s&nbsp;policy was to establish a
                    protecting line of provinces running from&nbsp;the Euxine to the North Sea, and
                    covering the peaceful districts&nbsp;to the south,—Moesia </span><span

                    defensive&nbsp;policy recommended by Augustus was adopted along the
                    whole&nbsp;of the northern frontier. The line of the great rivers was
                    held&nbsp;by an imposing mass of troops. Along the Rhine lay the armies&nbsp;of

                    guarded the Danube and the frontiers of Pannonia&nbsp;and Moesia. At frequent

                    powerful state whose claims to empire were second only to her&nbsp;own. The
                    victory of Carrhae (53 </span><span class="font0"
                    style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.)</span><span class="font1"> had
                    encouraged&nbsp;among the Parthians the idea of an invasion of Syria
                    and&nbsp;Asia Minor, while it had awakened in Rome a genuine&nbsp;fear of the
                    formidable power which had so suddenly arisen in&nbsp;the East. Caesar was at
                    the moment of his death preparing to&nbsp;avenge the death of Crassus by an
                    invasion of Parthia, and&nbsp;Antony’s schemes of founding an Eastern empire
                    which should&nbsp;rival that of Alexander included the conquest of the
                    kingdom&nbsp;beyond the Euphrates. Augustus, however, adhered to the&nbsp;policy
                    which he recommended to his successors of “ keeping&nbsp;the empire within its
                    bounds ”; and the Parthians, weakened&nbsp;by internal feuds and dynastic
                    quarrels, were in no mood for&nbsp;vigorous action. Roman pride was satisfied by
                    the restoration&nbsp;of the standards taken at Carrhae. Four legions guarded
