<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Stanza dell’ Incendio, painted by his master Perugino, he saved from obliteration; it still exists, well preserved, a&nbsp;most skilful piece of decorative work ; and he also set his&nbsp;pupils to copy a number of portrait-heads in the frescos&nbsp;of Piero della Francesca before they were destroyed.@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>Fig. 3 shows the positions of Raphael’s frescos in the stanze,&nbsp;which, both from their size and method of lighting, are&nbsp;very unsuited for the reception of these large pictures.&nbsp;The two most important rooms (A and B) are small, and&nbsp;have an awkward cross light from opposite windows.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Stanza della Segnatura (papal signature room), painted in 1509-11 (A on fig. 3). The first painting executed by Raphael in the stanze&nbsp;was the so-called Disputa, finished in 1509. It is very unlike the&nbsp;later oues in style, showing the commencement of transition from&nbsp;his Florentine to his “Roman manner”; as a »decorative work it&nbsp;is very superior to the other frescos ; the figures are much smaller&nbsp;in scale, as was suited to the very moderate size of the room, and&nbsp;the whole is arranged mainly on one plane, without those strong&nbsp;effects of perspective which are so unsuited to the decorative treatment of a wall-surface. In its religious sentiment too it far excels&nbsp;any of the later stanze paintings,&nbsp;retaining much of the sacred character of earlier Florentine and Umbrian&nbsp;art. As a scheme of decoration it&nbsp;appears to have been suggested by&nbsp;some of the early apsidal mosaics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Fig. 4 shows the disposition of its main masses, which seem to indicate&nbsp;the curved recess of an apse. Gold&nbsp;is largely used, with much richness&nbsp;of effect, while the later purely&nbsp;pictorial frescos have little or none.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The subject of this magnificent painting is the hierarchy of the church on earth and its glory in heaven.@@<sup>3</sup> The&nbsp;angels in the upper tier and the nude&nbsp;cherubs who carry the books of the Gospels are among the most&nbsp;beautiful figures that Raphael ever painted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The painting on the vault of this room is the next in date, and shows further transition towards the “Roman manner.” In his&nbsp;treatment of the whole Raphael has, with much advantage, been&nbsp;partly guided by the painting of Perugino’s vault in the next room&nbsp;(C). Though not without faults, it is a very skilful piece of decoration ; the pictures are kept subordinate to the lines of the&nbsp;vault, and their small scale adds greatly to the apparent size of the&nbsp;whole. A great part of the ground is gilt, marked with mosaiclike squares, a common practice with decorative painters,—not&nbsp;intended to deceive the eye, but simply to give a softer texture to&nbsp;the gilt surface by breaking up its otherwise monotonous glare.&nbsp;The principal medallions in each cell of this quadripartite vault&nbsp;are very graceful female figures, representing Theology, Science,&nbsp;Justice, and Poetry. Smaller subjects, some almost miniature-like&nbsp;in scale, are arranged in the intermediate spaces, and each has&nbsp;some special meaning in reference to the medallion it adjoins ; some&nbsp;of these are painted in warm monochrome to suggest bas-reliefs.&nbsp;The fine painting of the Flaying of Marsyas is interesting as showing Raphael’s study of antique sculpture: the figure of Marsyas&nbsp;is a copy of a Roman statue, of which several replicas exist. The&nbsp;very beautiful little picture of the Temptation of Eve recalls Albert&nbsp;Diirer’s treatment of that subject, though only vaguely. Much&nbsp;mutual admiration existed between Raphael and Diirer: in 1515&nbsp;Raphael sent the German artist a most masterly life study of two&nbsp;nude male figures (now at Vienna); on it is written in Albert&nbsp;Diirer’s beautiful hand the date and a record of its being a gift&nbsp;from Raphael. It is executed in red chalk, and was a study for&nbsp;two figures in the Battle of Ostia (see below).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">On the wall opposite the Disputa is the so-called School of Athens.@@<sup>4</sup> In this and the succeeding frescos all notion of decorative treatment is thrown aside, and Raphael has simply painted a&nbsp;magnificent series of paintings, treated as easel pictures might&nbsp;have been, with but little reference to their architectural surroundings.@@<sup>5</sup> The subject of this noble fresco, in contrast to that opposite,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">is Earthly Knowledge, represented by an assembly of those great philosophers, poets, and men of science of ancient Greece who were&nbsp;admitted by the church to have been not wholly without inspiration from Heaven, and by their labours to have prepared the way&nbsp;for the clearer light of Christianity. The central figures are Plato&nbsp;and Aristotle, while below and on each side are groups arranged&nbsp;with the most consummate skill, including the whole </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> filosofica&nbsp;famiglia” of Dante </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">{Infer.,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> iv. 133-144), and a number of other&nbsp;leaders of thought, selected in a way that shows no slight acquaintance with the history of philosophy and science among the ancient&nbsp;Greeks. In this selection we may fairly suppose that Raphael was&nbsp;aided by Bembo, Ariosto,@@<sup>6</sup> Castiglione, Bibbiena, or others of the&nbsp;crowd of scholars who at this time thronged the papal court.&nbsp;Many interesting portraits are introduced—Bramante as the aged&nbsp;Archimedes, stooping over a geometrical diagram ; a beautiful fairhaired youth on the left is Francesco Maria della Rovere, duke of&nbsp;Urbino ; and on the extreme right figures of Raphael himself and&nbsp;Perugino are introduced (see fig. 5, below). The stately building&nbsp;in which these groups are arranged is taken with modifications from&nbsp;Bramaute’s first design for St Peter’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Over the window (No. 6 on fig. 3) is a group of poets and musicians on Mount Parnassus, round a central figure of Apollo ; it contains&nbsp;many heads of great beauty and fine portraits of Dante and Petrarch.&nbsp;The former, as a theologian, appears also in the Disputa. Over&nbsp;the opposite window (No. 5) are graceful figures of the three chief&nbsp;Virtues, and at one side (No. 4) Gregory IX. (a portrait of Julius&nbsp;II.) presenting his volume of decretals to a jurist; beside him is&nbsp;a splendid portrait of Cardinal de’ Medici (afterwards Leo X.) before his face was spoiled by getting too stout. This painting shows&nbsp;the influence of Melozzo da Forli.@@<sup>7</sup> On the other side Justinian&nbsp;presents his code to Trebonianus (No. 3); this is inferior in execution and appears to have been chiefly painted by pupils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The next room (B), called La Stanza d’Eliodoro, was painted in 1511-14 ;@@<sup>8</sup> it is so called from the fresco (No. 7 in fig. 3) representing the expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple (2 Macc. iii.), an&nbsp;allusion to the struggles between Louis XII. of France and Julius&nbsp;II. The whole spirit of the subjects in this room is less broad and&nbsp;tolerant than in the first: no pagan ideas are admitted, and its&nbsp;chief motive is the glorification of the pontificate, with insistence&nbsp;on the temporal power. The main incident of this picture is the&nbsp;least successful part of it: the angel visitant on the horse is wanting in dignity, and the animal is poorly drawn, as is also the case&nbsp;with the horses of Attila’s army in the fresco opposite. The group&nbsp;of women and children on the left is, however, very beautiful, and&nbsp;the figures of Julius II. and his attendants are most nobly designed&nbsp;and painted with great vigour. The tall standing figure of Marc&nbsp;Antonio Raimondi, as one of the pope’s bearers, is a marvellous piece&nbsp;of portrait painting, as is also the next figure who bears his name&nbsp;on a scroll—</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">10 . RETRO . DE . FOLIARIIS . CREMONEN.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Behind, Giulio Romano is represented as another papal attendant.&nbsp;This picture was completed in 1512. Over the window (No. 8) is&nbsp;the scene of the Miracle at Bolsena of 1264, when the real presence&nbsp;was proved to a doubting priest by the appearance of blood-stains&nbsp;on the Corporal (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Orvieto). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Julius II. is introduced kneeling&nbsp;behind the altar ; and the lower spaces on each side of the windows&nbsp;are filled with two groups, that on the left with women, that on&nbsp;the right with officers of the papal guard. The last group is one&nbsp;of the most masterly of all throughout the stanze: each face, a&nbsp;careful portrait, is a marvel of expression and power, and the&nbsp;technical skill with which the whole is painted to the utmost&nbsp;degree of finish, almost without any tempera touches, is most&nbsp;wonderful. The next fresco in date (No. 10) is that of the Repulsion of Attila from the walls of Rome by Leo I., miraculously aided&nbsp;by the apparitions of St Peter and St Paul; it contains another&nbsp;allusion to the papal quarrels with France. It was begun in the&nbsp;lifetime of Julius II., but was only half finished at the time of his&nbsp;death in 1513 ; thus it happens that the portrait of his successor,&nbsp;the Medici pope Leo X., appears twice over, first as a cardinal&nbsp;riding behind the pope, painted before the death of Julius II., and&nbsp;again in the character of S. Leo, instead of the portrait of Julius&nbsp;which Raphael was about to paint.@@<sup>9</sup> Attila with his savage-looking&nbsp;army is not the most successful part of the fresco : the horses are&nbsp;very wooden in appearance, and the tight-fitting scale armour, put&nbsp;on in some impossible way without any joints, gives a very unreal&nbsp;and theatrical look to the picture. Part is the work of pupils.&nbsp;In 1514 he painted the Deliverance of St Feter from Prison, with</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@3</sup></span><span class="font1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It need hardly be said that the name Disputa is a misnomer ; there could&nbsp;be no dispute among the saints and doctors or the church about so well established a dogma as the real presence : the monstrance with the Host below and&nbsp;the figure of Christ above indicate His double presence both on earth and in&nbsp;heaven. Dr Braun, Springer, and Hagen have published monographs in German on this painting.</span></p>

The deep&nbsp;blue grounds so much used by Raphael’s school are very liable to injury&nbsp;from damp, and in most cases have been coarsely restored. Those in the&nbsp;Villa Madama are untouched, and in parts the damp has changed the ultra-marine into emerald green.</span></p>
