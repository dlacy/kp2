So unequally had property been divided under the ancient government, that by means of theſe conſiſcations about ſeven-tenths of the national territory was fuppoſed to be in the hands of the public. To this was added the plunder of the churches, conſiſting of gold and ſilvcr faints, and utenſils employed in divine worſhip, along wtth other articles of ieſs value ; among which may be mentioned the innumerable church bells, which were regarded as ſufficient for the manufacture of 15,000 pieces of cannon. Theſe refources formed a mafs of property ſuch as never was poſſeſſed by any government.</p><p>Other committees were engaged in very different objects. Highways were conſtructed, and canals planned and cut throughout the country. Immenſe manufacto-ries of arms were everywhere eſtabliſhed. At Paris alone 1100 muſkets were daily fabricated, and ioo pieces of cannon caſt every month. Public ſehools were affiduouſly inſtituted, and the French language taught in its purity from the Pyrenees to the Rhine. The French Convention poffeffed immenſe reſources, and they did not heſitate to laviſh them upon their ſchemes. Every ſcience and every art was called upon ſor aid, and the moſt accompliſhed men in every profeffion were employed in giving ſplendour to their country. The chemiſts, in particular, gave effential aid by the facility with wliicli they ſupplied materials for the manufacture of gun-powder ; and in return for their ſervices, Lavoiſier, the greateſt of them, ſuffered death by a moſt iniquitous ſentence. Not fewer than 200 new dramatic performances were produced in leſs than two years ; the object of which was to attach the people to the preſent order of things. The vigour with which the committees of ſubſiſtence exerted themſelves is particularly to be remarked. As all Europe was at war with France, and as England, Holland, and Spain, the three maritime powers, were engaged in the conteſt, it had been thought not impoffible to reduce France to great diſtreſs by famine, eſpecially as it was imagined that the country had not reſources to ſupply its immenſe population. But the preſent leaders of that country acted with the policy of a beſteged garriſon. They ſeized upon the whole proviſions in the country, and carried them to public granaries. They regiſtered the cattle, and made their owners reſponſible for them.— They provided tlie armies abundantly, and, as the people were accurately numbered, they dealt out in every diſtrict, on ſtated occaſtons, what was abfolutely neceffary ſor ſubſiſtence, and no more. To ali this the peo-ple ſubmitted <hi rend="italic">y</hi>  and indeed, throughout the whole of the mixed ſcenes of this revolution, the calm judgment of the hiſtorian is not a little perplexed. WC cannot avoid admiring the patience with which the people at Iarge endured every hardſhſp that was repreſented as weceſſary to the common cauſe, and the enthuſiaſtic energy with which they laviſhed their blood in defence of the independence oſ their country. At the ſame time, we muſt regard with indignation a»d diſguſt the worthlefs intrigues by means of which the ſanguinary factions in the Convention and the capital alternately maffacred each other.</p><p>During the winter the diſſenſions of the Jacobins ftill increaſed. They were divided into two clubs, of which the new one aſſembled at a hall whieh once belonged to the Cordeliers- The leaders of it were He-</p><p>bert, Ronſin, Vhtcent, and others ; but the old .ſociety retained its aſcendency, and Robefpierre was now &lt;Je-cidedly its leader. This extraordinary man had grada-ally accumulated in his own perſon the conſidence of the people and the direction of the government. As the committees were above the Convention, which was become little more than a ſilent court of record, ſo the committee of public ſaſety was above the other commit-tees. Robefpierre was the leader of this ruling com. mſttee. Barrere, St Juſt, Couthon, and others of its members, only acted a ſecondary part. They laboured in the buſinefs of the ſtate, but the radical power was with Robefpierre. He ſurrounded the members of the Convention with ſpies. He was jealous and implacable, and ſet no bounds to the ſhedding of blood. On the 25th of March he brought to trial the following active Jacobins, who were condemned and executed on thc following day : Hebert, Ronſin, Momoro, Vincent, Du Croquet, Kocq, Col. Laumur, M. M. Bourgeois, Mazuel, La Boureau, Ancard, Le Clerc, Proly, Deſ-ſieux, Anacharſis Cloots, Pereira, Florent Armand, Deſcombes, and Dcbuiſon. Not ſatisſied with this, on thc 2d of April he brought to trial nine of thoſe who had once been his moſt vigorous aſſociates, Danton* Fabre d’Eglantine, Bazire, Chabot, Philippeaux, Camille D'eſmoulins, Lacroix, Delaunay d’Angers, He-rault de Sechelles, who, along with weſterqian, were executed on the evening of the 5th.</p><p>Still, however, the preparations for the enſuing campaign were proceeding with unabated vigour. 'The committee for military affairs, at the head of which were Carnot, La Fitte, d’Aniffi, and others, was bufy in arranging along the frontiers the immenſe force which the requiſitſon had called forth. Plans of attack and defence were made out by this committee; and when approved by the committee of public ſafety they were fent to the generals to be executed. On the other ſide, the allies were making powerful preparations for another attempt to ſubjugate France. The Emperor himſelf took the held at the head of the armies in the Nether-lands. The plan of the campaign is ſaid to have been, formed by the Auſtrias Colonel Mack, weſt Flanders was to be protected by a ſtrong body of men ; the main army was to penetrate to Landrecies, and getting within the line of French frontier towns, it was to cut them off from the interior by covering the country from Maubeuge to the ſea. The plan was <hi rend="italic">bold.</hi>  It belongs to military men to judge whether this was not its only merit, when attempting to put it in execution, the allies muſt have been ill informed of the immenſe force which the French were collecting againſt therm Even the town of Liſſe alone, which is capable of containing a numerous army within its walls, and which was to be left in their rear, ſhould have ſeerned an inſurmountable objection to the plan.</p><p>On the 16th of April the Auſtrian, Britiſh, and Dutch armies affembled on the heights above Cateau, and were reviewed by the emperor. On the following day they advanced in eight columne againſt the French, drove in tlieir whole poſts, and* penetrated beyond Lan-drecies which place the French attempted to. relieve, but without ſuccefs. The allied army now amounted to 187,000 men, who were diſpoſed in the following manner; 15,000 Dutch and <hi rend="italic">15,000</hi>  Auſtrians, under the prince of Orange and general.
