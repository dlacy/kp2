This practice was ſirſt begun by Claudius, by his ſtri-king afreſh ſeveral medals of Auguſtus. Nero did the ſame ; and Titus, after his father’s example, ſtruck re-ſtitutions of moſt of his predeceffors. Gallienus ſtruck a general reſtitution of all the preceding emperors on two medals ; the one bearing an altar, the other an eagle, without the rest.</p>
