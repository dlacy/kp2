<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d!gnitate regali,</span><span class="font1"> no man can marry a queen-dowager without ſpecial licence from the king, on pain of forfeiting his lands and goods. &quot;This Sir Edward Coke&nbsp;tells us, was enacted in parliament in 6 Henry VI.&nbsp;though the ſtatute be not in print. But ſhe, though&nbsp;an alien born, ſhall ſtill be entitled to dower after the&nbsp;king’s demiſe, wſhich no other alien is. A queen-dowager when married again to a ſubject, doth not loſe&nbsp;her regal dignity,, as peereffes-dowager do wſhen they&nbsp;marry commoners. For Katharine, queen dowager of&nbsp;Henry V. though ſhe married a private gentleman,&nbsp;Owen ap Meredith ap Theodore, commonly called&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Owen Tudor;</span><span class="font1"> yet, by the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Katharine queen&nbsp;of England,</span><span class="font1"> maintained an action againſt the biſhop of&nbsp;Carliſle. And ſo the dowager of Navarre marrying&nbsp;with Edmond the brother of king Edward I. maintained an action of dower by the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">queen oſ Navarre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince of Wales, or heir apparent to the&nbsp;crow<sup>r</sup>n, and alſo his royal conſort, and the princeſs&nbsp;royal, or eldeſt daughter oſ the king, are likew<sup>r</sup>ife peculiarly regarded by the laws. For, by ſtatute 2 ç&nbsp;Edw. III. to compaſs or conſpire the death of the former, or to violate the chaſtity of either of the latter,&nbsp;are as much high treaſon as to conſpire the death of&nbsp;the king, or violate the chaſtity of the queen. And&nbsp;this upon the ſame reaſon as was before given ; becauſe the prince of Wales is next in ſucceſſion to the&nbsp;erow<sup>r</sup>11, and to violate his wife might taint the blood-royal with baſtardy ; and the eldeſt daughter of the&nbsp;king is alſo alone inheritable to the crown on failure&nbsp;of ilfue male, and therefore more reſpected by the laws&nbsp;than any of her younger fiſters ; rnſomuch that upon_&nbsp;this, united with other (feodal) principles, while our&nbsp;military tenures were in force, the king might levy an&nbsp;aid for marrying his eldeſt daughter, and her only.&nbsp;The heir apparent to the crown is uſually made prince&nbsp;of Wales and earl of Cheſter, by ſpecial creation and&nbsp;inveſtiture ; but being the king’s eldeſt ſon, he is by&nbsp;inheritance duke of Cornwall, w<sup>r</sup>ithout any new creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reſt of the royal family may be conſidered&nbsp;in two different lights, according to the different ſenſes&nbsp;in wſhich the term </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">royal family</span><span class="font1"> is uſed. </span><span class="font2">Ί </span><span class="font1">lie larger&nbsp;ſenſe includes all thoſe who are by any pofſibility inheritable to the crown. Such, before the revolution,&nbsp;were all the deſeendants of William the Conqueror ;&nbsp;who had branched into an amazing extent by intermarriages w<sup>,</sup>ith the ancient nobility. Since the revolution and act of ſettlement, it means the Proteſtant&nbsp;j iſſue of the princeſs Sophia 3 now comparatively few in&nbsp;number, but wſhich in proceſs of time may poſſibly be&nbsp;as largely diſſuſed. The more confined ſenſe includes&nbsp;only thoſe wſho are in a certain degree of propinquity&nbsp;to the reigning prince, and to whom therefore the law&nbsp;pays an extraordinary regard and relpect ; but after&nbsp;that degree is paſt, they fall into the rank of ordinary&nbsp;ſubjects, and are ſeldom conſidered any farther, unleſs,&nbsp;called to the ſucceſſion upon failure of the nearer lines.&nbsp;For though collateral conſanguinity is regarded indefinitely with reſpect to inheritance or ſueceſſion, yet it&nbsp;is and can only be regarded within ſome certain limits&nbsp;in any other reſpect, by the natural conſtitution of&nbsp;things and the dictates of pofitive law<sup>r</sup>.</span></p><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font2">vounger fons∙ and daughters of the king, and</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">other branches </span><span class="font2">or </span><span class="font1">the royal family, who </span><span class="font2">are </span><span class="font1">not in </span><span class="font2">the </span><span class="font1">immediate line of ſucceſſion, were therefore little </span><span class="font2">far</span><span class="font1">ther regarded by the ancient law, than to give them a&nbsp;certain degree of precedence before all peers and public officers as vzell ecclefiaſtical as temporal. This is&nbsp;done by the ſtatute 31 Henry VIII. c. 10. which&nbsp;enacts, that no perfon except the king’s children ſhall&nbsp;preſume to fix or have place at the fide of the cloth of&nbsp;eſtate in the parliament chamber ; and that certain&nbsp;great officers therein named ſhall have precedence&nbsp;above all dukes, except only ſuch as ſhall happen to be&nbsp;the king’s ſon, brother, uncle, nephew (wſhich Sir Edward Coke explains to fignify grandſon or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nePos),</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;brother’s or filler’s ſon. But under the deſeription </span><span class="font2">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the king’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">children,</span><span class="font1"> his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">grandſons</span><span class="font1"> are held to be included, without having recourſe to Sir Edward Coke’s&nbsp;interpretation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nephew ;</span><span class="font1"> and. therefore when his late&nbsp;majeſty king George II. created his grandſon Edward,&nbsp;the ſecond ſon of Frederick prince of Wale« deceaſed,&nbsp;duke of York, and referred it to the houſe of lords to&nbsp;fettle his place and precedence, they certified that he&nbsp;ought to have precedence next to the late duke of Cumberland, the then king’s youngeſt ſon ; and that he&nbsp;might have a ſeat on the left hand oſ the cloth of eſtate.&nbsp;But when, on the acceſſion of his preſent majefty<sub>r&nbsp;</sub>theſe royal perſonages ceaſed to take place as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">children,</span><span class="font1"> and ranked only as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">brother</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">uncle</span><span class="font1"> of the&nbsp;king, they alſo left their ſeats on the fide of the cloth&nbsp;of eſtate ; ſo that wſhen the duke of Glouceſter, his majeſty’s ſecond brother, took his ſeat in the houſe of&nbsp;peers, he was placed on the upper end of the earls&nbsp;bench (on which the dukes uſually fit) next to his royal&nbsp;highneſs the duke of York. And in 1717, upon a&nbsp;queſtion referred to all the judges by king George </span><span class="font2">1.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">it w<sup>,</sup>as reſolved, by the opinion of ten againſt the other&nbsp;two, that the education and care of all the king’s grandchildren, while minors, did belong of right to his majeſty as king of this realm, even during their father’s&nbsp;life. But they all agreed, that the care and approbation of their marriages, wſhen grown up, belonged to&nbsp;the king their grandfather. And the judges have more&nbsp;recently concurred in opinion, that this care and approbation extend alſo to the preſumptive heir of the crown;&nbsp;though to wſhat other branches oſ the royal family the&nbsp;ſame did extend, they did not find preciſely determined.&nbsp;The moſt frequent inſtances of the crown’s interpofition&nbsp;go no farther than nephews and nieces ; but examples&nbsp;are not w<sup>,</sup>anting of its reaching to more diftant collaterals. And the ſtatute 6 Henry VI. before mentioned,&nbsp;which prohibits the marriage of a queen-dovzager without the conſent of the king, aſſigns this reaſon for it ;&nbsp;“ becauſe the diſparagement of the c,ueen ſhall give&nbsp;greater comfort and example to other ladies of eſtate,&nbsp;wſho are of the blood-royal, more lightly to diſparage&nbsp;themſelves.” Therefore by the ſtatute 28 Hen. VIII.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">c. </span><span class="font1">’8. (repealed, among other ſtatutes of treaſons, by&nbsp;1 Edw. VI. c. 12.)· it was made high treaſon for any&nbsp;man to contract marriage with the king’s children or&nbsp;reputed children·, his fiſters or aunts </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ex parte βaterna,</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;the children of his brethren or fillers ; being exactly&nbsp;the fame degrees?to which precedence is allowed by the&nbsp;ſtatute 31 Hen. VIII. before-mentioned And now,&nbsp;by ſtatute 12 Geo. III. c. ιr. no deſeendant of the&nbsp;body of king George II. (other than the iffiιe of prin-ceiſes married into foreign families) is capable of con-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
