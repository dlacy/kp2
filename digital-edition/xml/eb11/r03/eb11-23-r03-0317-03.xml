                <p><label>RIDING</label>, the art or practice of locomotion on the back of an animal
                    or in a vehicle (the verb <hi rend="italic">to ride</hi> originally meant “ to
                    travel,” or “go,” as the derived noun <hi rend="italic">road</hi> means “ a
                    way”). Where no vehicle is specified <hi rend="italic">{e.g.</hi> “ riding a
                    bicycle ”), the word is associated with horseback riding, for exercise or
                    pleasure.</p>
               <p>The origin of the use of the horse as a means of transport goes back to
                    prehistoric times. The fable of the centaurs, if ' the derivation from <hi
                        rend="italic">Kevrecv,</hi> to goad, raὒpos, bull, be accepted (but see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Centaur),</hi> would indicate the early existence of
                    pastoral peoples living on horseback, like the modern cowboys (cp.</p>
               <p>“ cow-punchers ”) or <hi rend="italic">gauchos</hi> of North and South America.
                    Archaeological discoveries in India, Persia, Assyria and Egypt show that in the
                    polished stone age quaternary man had domesticated the horse, while a Chinese
                    treatise, the <hi rend="italic">Goei-leaotse,</hi> the fifth book of the
                    Vouking, a sort of military code dating from the reign of the emperor Hoang-Ti
                    (2637 years B.C.), places the cavalry on the wings of the army. The Hebrews

               <p>the use of the horse in war (Job xxxix. 18-25), as did the Persians (Cyrus at
                    the battle of Thymbra), Greeks and Romans. The Greeks and Romans, especially the
                    former, were skilled horsemen, and feats on horseback were a feature of their
                    games. They used no stirrup, but had both bridle and bit. They rode bareback, or
                    on a cloth or skin strapped to the horse.</p>
               <p>When roads were poor and vehicles cumbersome horseback was almost the only
                    method of travel for both sexes. With the introduction of steam-locomotion and
                    the improvement of roads, however, riding has become to a large extent a sport,
                    rather than a necessity. There are different styles of riding adapted to the
                    different purposes for which horses are ridden— on the road, in the school,
                    hunting, racing, steeple-chasing and in the cavalry service—just as there are
                    different horses more suitable by conformation, breeding and training for each.</p>
               <p>In western civilization there is a traditional difference between the riding of
                    men and women, in this particular, that men ride astride and women on a
                    side-saddle. But in the following observations we deal generally with the more
                    important features of riding as practised astride.</p>
               <p>After securing an animal of the right height, weight and disposition, with a
                    saddle of a length of tree and a breadth of seat that fits the rider and that is
                    lined to fit the back of the horse, with a bridle bitted to his mouth, the first
                    step is to mount. Having taken up the reins, the rider should stand at his
                    horse’s near (left) shoulder, facing towards the tail, and in that position hold
                    the stirrup with his right hand for the reception of his left foot. By standing
                    at the shoulder the rider is out of harm’s way in the event of the horse kicking
                    while he mounts. Ladies generally have the aid of a block or a groom’s or
                    escort’s hand beneath the left foot. But a woman should be able to mount without
                    aid, by lowering her stirrup, so that she can reach it from the ground, and then
                    raising it again when she is seated in the saddIe. Riding astride is sometimes
                    recommended for women. The chief argument in its favour — symmetrical
                    development of the figure—is, however, lost if the growing girl be taught to
                    ride on a side-saddle of which the pommels can be shifted to the off side on
                    alternate days.</p>
               <p>Having gained the saddle, the necessity arises for <hi rend="italic">seat</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">hands.</hi> Here good instruction is imperative at the
                    outset. The great desideratum in a seat on horseback is that it should be firm.
                    A rider with an insecure seat is apt to be thrown by any unexpected movement the
                    horse may make; and, without a firm seat, the acquirement of good hands is
                    well-nigh hopeless, because, when the balance is once disturbed the insecure
                    rider will have to depend on something else for the maintenance of his seat, and
                    this generally takes the shape of “ riding on the horse’s mouth,” a practice as
                    cruel as it is ugly.</p>
               <p>Having gained the saddle, the rider should adjust the stirrups to the proper
                    length, depending on the kind of riding, the length of his leg and the roughness
                    of the horse’s trot. Sitting well in the middle of the saddle, the thighs turned
                    in, and the heels drawn somewhat back, the stirrup leathers may be let out or
                    taken up until the tread of the stirrup is on a level with the inner ankle bone,
                    and at this length, when the rider stands up, his fork will easily clear the
                    pommel of the saddle. For maintaining his seat the horseman should depend upon
                    his thighs and knees only, and not upon the knee and calf; a proper seat should
                    be a mixture of balance and grip; a man riding by balance only is sure to be
                    thrown, while to grip with all one’s might during an hour’s ride is to undertake
                    as much exertion as should last for a whole day. The position of the foot
                    exercises much influence on the security of the seat; it should be opposite the
                    girth, parallel with the barrel of the horse, with the heels depressed. A good
                    seat on a horse should not be strong merely; it should be graceful; above the
                    loins the body should be loose, so as readily to adapt itself to every motion of
                    the horse, but it should be upright.</p>
               <p>Beginners are advised to practise riding with and without stirrups; thus, let
                    the pupil who has ridden half an hour in a saddle with stirrups have a cloth
                    substituted for the saddle for about ten minutes, care being taken to observe
                    the rules already laid down for the position of the legs; in this way the proper
                    seat will be strengthened.</p>
               <p>The proper adjustment of the reins is the next thing to be attended to, and as
                    the management of these depends so much upon the seat being firm and independent
                    of the bridle the acquisition of a firm seat is certainly half-way towards the
                    acquirement of good hands. An excellent way to start a pupil is on a sure-footed
                    horse without bridle, the master governing him by a leading rein until the pupil
                    has acquired a firm seat and can be trusted with reins. Assuming that a
                    double-reined bridle is used, the third finger of the left hand should be first
                    inserted between the snaffle reins; then the little, third and second fingers
                    should be between the curb reins, the two outside reins being the curb, and the
                    two inside ones the snaffle. In this manner of holding the reins the snaffle is
                    not so likely to slip, while the curb can be easily slackened or drawn tighter.
                    As military riders use the curb only the position of snaffle and curb as just
                    explained is reversed in the cavalry service. The snaffle reins should be drawn
                    up gently until the rider feels that he has an equal and light hold of his
                    horse’s mouth on both sides, with just so much pressure that the slightest
                    movement of the left or right rein would cause him to turn to the left or right
                    respectively. The arms from the shoulder to the elbow should hang naturally,
                    close to the sides, and the arms from elbow to wrist should be about parallel to
                    the ground, the wrist being kept loose, so as to yield gently with every motion
                    of the horse. The rider sitting in the position described, square to the front,
                    with his shoulders well back, will be riding with fairly long reins, one of the
                    secrets of good hands.</p>
               <p>When the horse is in motion the hands should not be held rigid, as the horse’s
                    mouth would thereby become dead, and the horse would lean unpleasantly on the
                    hand; but the rider should give and take, without, however, entirely relaxing
                    the hold.</p>
               <p>In order to encourage the horse to walk the head must not be confined, but a
                    light feeling of the horse’s mouth must be kept up. Should the horse, unasked,
                    break into a trot, never snatch at his mouth, but restrain him gently. To trot,
                    press the legs to the saddle, and raise the bridle hand a little, and, after a
                    moment’s sitting close, begin to rise (“ pose ”) in cadence with the action of
                    the horse. The rising to the trot should be performed easily; the legs must not
                    swing backwards and forwards, nor should the hands be jerked up and down. To*
                    start the canter, which should always be done from the walk and not the trot,
                    take up the curb rein a little and turn the horse’s head slightly to the right,
                    at the same time pressing the left leg behind the girth; the horse will then
                    lead with the off (right) fore leg, which is generally preferred; but a
                    well-broken hack should lead with either leg at command, and if he be cantered
                    in a circle to the left he must lead with the near leg, as otherwise an ugly
                    fall is likely to result from the leg being crossed. Galloping is a pace not to
                    be generally indulged in by road or park riders; when it is, the hands should be
                    kept low, the body thrown back, and an extra grip taken with the knees, as
                    nearly all horses pull more or less when extended.</p>
               <p>Hitherto only road or park riding has been considered. When a person has become
                    a fair road rider he has made some progress towards being a hunting man. But if
                    first principles are disregarded, and a follower of hounds believes in the
                    system “it doesn’t matter how you ride so long as you stick on,” he will not
                    only always be a “ sight ” but a menace in the hunting field. Few self-taught
                    riders attain to excellence; they may keep a good place in hunting, if possessed
                    of plenty of courage, and mounted on a bold and not too tender-mouthed horse,
                    but they never will be riders in the proper sense of the word.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Hunting and Riding to Hounds.—</hi> For practical purposes the
                    chief difference between a park seat and a hunting seat consists in the
                    shortening of the stirrups some two or three holes. The seat of the hunting man
                    is the most important of any connected with amusement; he must sit firm, so as
                    not to be thrown off when his horse leaps, or makes a mistake, and he must be
                    able to save his horse under all circumstances, and to make as much of him as
                    possible. As with road riding, so with hunting, the actual</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r03-0319" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0342.jp2"/>
               <p>length of the stirrups will depend a good deal upon the shape and action of the
                    horse, but the nature of the animal and the peculiarities of the country ridden
                    over will also have something to do with their adjustment. A puller will compel
                    the rider to shorten his leathers one or perhaps two holes—a course that may
                    also be rendered necessary in a hilly country, for, in going down hill, the
                    stirrups, if kept at the ordinary length, will generally feel a great deal too
                    long. The rider’s body must be always close to the saddle in leaping, for if he
                    were jerked up, the weight of say only a 10-stone man coming down on the horse a
                    couple of seconds after he has negotiated a large fence is sufficient to throw
                    the animal down. Nothing but actual practice with hounds can teach a man how to
                    ride where all kinds of going and obstacles of various sorts, natural and
                    artificial, have to be encountered in a day’s hunting. For example, the country
                    gone over is seldom level springy turf; it is up hill and down dale, across
                    ridge and furrow, over ground studded with ant-hills (which, unlike mole-hills,
                    are often very hard), over ploughed or boggy land. Each of these varieties
                    requires a different method of riding over, and nearly every horse will require
                    different handling under similar circumstances. It will therefore be seen that
                    much depends on the rider having good hands. This qualification, though
                    generally understood, is difficult to define. A rider with good hands never
                    depends upon his reins for Tetaininghisseat ; nor does he pull at the horse’s
                    mouth so as to make him afraid to go up to his bit; nor again does he ever use
                    more force than is necessary for the accomplishment of what he desires to
                    perform. But besides all this, there is an unaccountable sympathetic something
                    about the man with good hands that cannot be described. Pullers appear to
                    renounce pulling, refusers take to jumping and clumsy horses become nearly as
                    handy as a trick horse in a circus. Though hands can to a great extent be
                    acquired by care and practice, yet in the highest form this is a gift and cannot
                    be learned.</p>
               <p>There are different kinds of ” fences,” as all obstacles are generic-ally
                    called. First, there is timber, such as gates, stiles and rails; the first two
                    are, nine times out of ten, awkward jumps, as the take off is either poached by
                    cattle, or else is on the ascent or descent. Hedges vary according to the custom
                    of the country in which they are found: they either grow in the soil of the
                    field, and are protected by a ditch on one side, or are planted on a bank with a
                    ditch on one side or sometimes on both. Then again there are such large banks as
                    are found in Wales, Devon and Cornwall. Lastly come water jumps, which are met
                    with in two forms: the water is either within an inch or two of the top of the
                    bank, so as to be about on a level with the field through which it flows, or
                    there may be a space of some 6 or 7 ft. from the bank to the water. For the
                    successful negotiation of brooks a bold horse is required, ridden by a bold man.
                    No fence that is ever encountered stops such a large proportion of the field as
                    water; even a clear 6 ft. of it will prove a hindrance to some, while anything
                    over 10 or 12 ft. will in general be crossed only by a very few. Some horses,
                    good performers over any description of fence, will not jump water under any
                    circumstances; while the chance of a ducking deters many from riding at it; and,
                    however bold the horse may be, he will soon refuse water if his rider be
                    perpetually in two minds when approaching it.</p>
               <p>The pace at which a hunter should be ridden at his fences depends upon the
                    nature of the fence, and the peculiarities of each individual horse. With some
                    very good jumpers— they can hardly be called good hunters—to steady them is to
                    bid for a fall, while with some very clever hunters to hurry them is to bring
                    them to grief. With ordinary’ horses, however, it is a good general rule to ride
                    at fences of all descriptions as slowly as the nature of the obstacle admits. In
                    grass countries, where “ flying fences ” are found, the rate of speed must of
                    necessity be quicker than when about to take a Devonshire bank of some 7 ft.
                    high, but even at a flying fence the rider should steady his horse so as to
                    contract the length of his stride, in order that he may measure the distance for
                    taking off with greater accuracy. Flying fences consist of a hedge with or
                    without a post and rail, and with or without a ditch on one or both sides;
                    consequently a horse has to jump both high and wide to clear them. But in
                    jumping a gate, or a flight of rails, as ordinarily situated, there is no width
                    to be covered, and to make a horse go through the exertion of jumping both high
                    and wide when he need only do one is to waste his power, added to which to ride
                    fast at timber, unless very low with a ditch on the landing side, is highly
                    dangerous.</p>
               <p>All hedges on banks, banks and doubles must be ridden at slowly; they are
                    usually of such a size as. to make flying them impossible, or at least
                    undesirable. Horses jump them on and off, and in taking them at a moderate pace
                    there is a chance of stopping on the top and choosing a better place to jump
                    from, or, if needs be, of returning and taking the fence at another place.
                    Cramped places will have to be jumped from a walk or even at a stand; for
                    instance, a tree may be in a line with and close to the only practicable place
                    in a fence; it then becomes necessary to go round the tree before a run at the
                    place can be managed. So, too, with places that have to be crawled over between
                    trees, or with dykes to be crawled down.</p>
               <p>In jumping an ordinary hedge or ditch at moderate speed, there is of course a
                    moment of time during which the horse is on his hind legs, and in theory the
                    rider should then lean forward, but, in practice, this position is so momentary,
                    and the lash out of the hind legs in the spring is so powerful, that it is best
                    not to lean forward at all, because of the difficulty, if not impossibility, of
                    getting back in time for the reverse movement, when the rider should be
                    preparing to render the horse some assistance with the bridle as his feet touch
                    the ground.</p>
               <p>When a line of willows indicates the whereabouts of a brook, the horse should be
                    well collected, a clear place selected, so far as circumstances allow, and the
                    pace increased, though in short strides, up to the very brink. If the hounds
                    jump at the brook, even though they fail to clear it, the rider may take it for
                    granted that at that place the leap is within the capacity of any ordinary
                    hunter in his stride; hence if, when going at three parts speed, a horse's feet
                    come just right to take off, the mere momentum of his body would take him over a
                    place 15 ft. wide.</p>
               <p>The experience of a single day’s hunting will teach the novice that gates are
                    far oftener opened than jumped; it is therefore necessary that a hunter should
                    be handy at opening them. Many accidents have arisen from horses rushing through
                    a gateway directly the latch is released, or from their jumping a gate at which
                    they have been pulled up to enable the rider to open it. The horse should be
                    taught to obey the leg as well as the hand, and, by a slight pressure of the
                    leg, should throw his haunches round to the left or right as occasion may
                    require.</p>

                    —The qualities possessed by a good jockey, either on the flat or across country,
                    show the value of early instruction in riding. After having been some time in a
                    training stable, a lad is put on a quiet horse at exercise; his stirrups arc
                    adjusted, and the reins knotted for him at a proper length. He subsequently
                    rides other horses, each with some peculiarity perhaps, and, to keep his place
                    in the string, a sluggard must be kept going, and an impetuous one restrained;
                    they cannot both be ridden alike, but they must both be ridden as a jockey
                    should ride them. In this way the lad learns the principle of holding a puller,
                    getting pace out of a lazy one, and leaving well alone with a nice free but
                    temperate mover; he learns to do everything in a horsemanlike manner, and when
                    he has raised himself to the pitch of a “ fashionable ” jockey, he will
                    frequently be called upon to ride several horses a day at race meetings. A
                    jockey must therefore, more than any other civilian rider, have a hand for all
                    sorts of horses, and in the case of two and three year olds a very good hand it
                    must be. The same ability to adapt himself to circumstances must be possessed by
                    the steeple-chase jockey, who should possess fine hands to enable him to handle
                    his horse while going at his fences at three-quarter speed. In most details the
                    nearer a hunting man approaches to a steeple-chase jockey the better; but in the
                    matter of the seat it must be remembered that a jockey’s exertions last but a
                    few minutes, while none can tell when the hunting man may finish his day's work;
                    the jockey can therefore ride with more absolute grip during his race than the
                    rider to hounds.</p>
