<p><span class="font0">the earl of Bute, became first lord of the treasury, and the marquess of Rockingham was amongst those who in the following year were dismissed from their lord-lieutenancies. The&nbsp;opposition now grew so strong that Lord Bute resigned in&nbsp;April 1763, and the king, true to his policy, appointed George&nbsp;Grenville to be his successor. But Grenville’s section of the&nbsp;Whig party was not strong enough to maintain him in power&nbsp;long, and in July 1765 Lord Rockingham formed his first&nbsp;administration with General Conway and the duke of Grafton&nbsp;as secretaries of state. The cabinet seemed stronger than it&nbsp;really was, for it was divided by intestine quarrels, and the&nbsp;earl of Chatham refused to have anything to do with it. Nevertheless, Rockingham recovered his lord-lieutenancies and won&nbsp;reputation as a good administrator. In May 1766 the duke&nbsp;of Grafton, a far abler man than Rockingham, though neither&nbsp;so conciliatory in his manners nor so gcnerally popular, seceded&nbsp;from the government, and in August 1766 he succeeded his&nbsp;former chief as first lord of the treasury and prime minister.&nbsp;Then followed many years of fruitless opposition to the king’s&nbsp;personal authority as exhibited through his ministers, but at&nbsp;last, on the 27th of March 1782, Lord Rockingham again&nbsp;became prime minister with Fox and Shelburne (afterwards&nbsp;marquess of Lansdowne) as secretaries of state. This time he&nbsp;enjoyed office for but a few weeks, for he died on the ist of&nbsp;July 1782. He left no issue, and his property went to his&nbsp;nephew, the 2nd Earl Fitzwilfiam, his titles becoming extinct.&nbsp;A few words from his epitaph by Burke deserve quotation as&nbsp;giving the reason of the predominance of such an ordinary&nbsp;man as Lord Rockingham over a party abounding in men of&nbsp;great abilities: “ A man worthy to be held in esteem, because&nbsp;he did not five for himself. ... He far excceded all other&nbsp;statesmen in the art of drawing togcther, without the seduction&nbsp;of self-interest, the concurrence and co-operation of various&nbsp;dispositions and abilities of men, whom he assimilated to his&nbsp;character and associated in his labours.”</span></p>

In 1841 the town of Rock Island&nbsp;was formed by the consolidation of two small settlements&nbsp;named Stephenson and Farnhamsburg and was incorporated;&nbsp;it received a city charter in 1849. Upon the west end of the&nbsp;island the United States government in 1816 built Fort Armstrong, where on the 21st of September 1832, at the close of&nbsp;the Black Hawk War, a treaty of peace was signed by General&nbsp;WinfieId Scott and Governor John Reynolds of Illinois and by&nbsp;the chiefs of the Sauk and Foxes, and where, six days before,&nbsp;General Scott and Governor Reynolds had made a treaty with&nbsp;the Winncbagoes.
