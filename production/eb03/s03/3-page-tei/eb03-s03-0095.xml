The ſubſtantive to which ſeſtertius referred is either <hi rend="italic">as,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pendus ;</hi> and sest<hi rend="italic">ertius as </hi>is two aſſes and a half ; <hi rend="italic">ſeſtertium pondus,</hi> two pondera and a half, or two hundred and fifty denarii. When the denarius passed for ten aſſes, the ſeſtertius of two aſſes and a half was a quarter of it ; and the Romans continued to keep their accounts in theſe ſeſterces long after the denarius passed for ſixteen aſſes ; till, growing rich, they found it more convenient to reckon by quarters of the denarius, which they called <hi rend="italic">nummi,</hi> and uſed the words <hi rend="italic">nummus</hi> and s<hi rend="italic">estertius</hi> indifferently, as ſynonymous terms, and ſometimes both together, as <hi rend="italic">ſestertius nummus ;</hi> in which case the word <hi rend="italic">ſeſtertius,</hi> having loſt its original ſigniſication, was uſed as a ſubſtantive ; for <hi rend="italic">ſeſtertius nummus</hi> was not two nummi and a half, but a ſingle nummus of four aſſes. They called any ſum under two thouſand ſeſterces so many <hi rend="italic">ſestertii</hi> in the maſculine gender ; two thouſand ſeſterces they called <hi rend="italic">duo</hi> or b<hi rend="italic">ina sestertia,</hi> in the neuter ; ſo many quarters making five hundred denarii, which was twice the ſeſtertium ; and they ſaid <hi rend="italic">dena, vicena, &amp;c. sestertia,</hi> till the ſum amounted to a thouſand ſeſtertia, which was a million of ſeſterces. But, to avoid ambiguity, they did not uſe the neuter <hi rend="italic">ſestertium</hi> in the singular number, when the whole ſum amounted to no more than a thouſand ſeſterces, or one ſeſtertium. They called a million of ſeſterces <hi rend="italic">decies nummum,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">decies sestertium,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">decies centena millia nummorum,</hi> or sestertiorum (the maſculine gender), omitting <hi rend="italic">centena millia</hi> for the ſake of brevity. They like- wiſe called the ſame ſum <hi rend="italic">decies sestertium</hi> (in the neuter gender) for <hi rend="italic">decies centies sestertium,</hi> omitting <hi rend="italic">centies</hi> for the ſame reaſon; or ſimply <hi rend="italic">decies,</hi> omitting <hi rend="italic">centena millia sestertium,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">centies sestertium ;</hi> and with the numeral adverbs <hi rend="italic">decies, vicies, centies, millies,</hi> and the like, either <hi rend="italic">centena millia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">centies</hi> was always underſtood. Theſe were their most uſual forms of expreſſion ; though for b<hi rend="italic">na, dena, vicena J'eβertia,</hi> they frequently ſaid <hi rend="italic">bina, dena, vicena millia nummum.</hi> If the conſular denarius contained 6o troy grains of fine silver, it was worth ſomewhat  more than eight-pence farthing and a half ſterling ; and the as, of 16 to the denarius, a little more than a halfpenny. To reduce the ancient ſeſterces of two aſſes and a half, when the denarius passed for 16, to pounds ſterling, multiply the given number by 5454, and cut off  six figures on the right hand for decimals. To reduce <hi rend="italic">nummi sestertii,</hi> or quarters of the denarius, to pounds ſterling ; if the given ſum be conſular money, multiply it by 8727, and cut off six figures on the right hand for decimals; but for imperial money diminiſh the ſaid product by one-eighth of itſelf.

This place is famous for the loves of <hi rend="smallcaps">Hero</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Leander,</hi> ſung by the poet Musæus.</p><p>SESUVIUM, in botany ; a genus of plants belonging to the claſs of icoſandria, and to the order of trigynia. The calyx is coloured and divided into five parts; there are no petals ; the capſule is egg-ſhaped, three- celled, opening horizontally about the middle, and containing many ſeeds. There is only one ſpecies, the portulacastrum<hi rend="italic">,</hi> purſlane-leaved ſeſuvium, which is a native of the West Indies.</p><p>SET, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sets,</hi> a term uſed by the farmers and gardeners to expreſs the young plants of the white thorn and other ſhrubs, with which they uſe to raiſe their quick or quick-ſet hedges. The white thorn is the belt of all trees for this purpose ; and, under proper regulations, its ſets ſeldom fail of anſwering the farmer’s utmoſt expectations.</p><p><hi rend="italic">SET-off,</hi> in law, is an act whereby the defendant acknowledges the juſtice of the plaintiff’s demand on the one hand ; but, on the other, ſets up a demand of his own, to counterbalance that of the plaintiff, either in the whole, or in part : as, if the plaintiff ſues for 10l. due on a note of hand, the defendant may ſet off 91. due to himſelf for merchandiſe ſold to the plaintiff; and, in cafe he pleads ſuch ſet-off, muſt pay the remaining balance into court. This anſwers very nearly to the <hi rend="italic">compenſatio</hi> or ſtoppage of the civil law, and depends upon the ſtatutes 2 Geo. II. cap. 22. and 8 Geo. II. cap. 24.</p><p>SETACEOUS <hi rend="smallcaps">worm,</hi> in natural hiſtory, a name given by Dr Lifter to that long and Tender water- worm, which ſo much reſembles a horſe-hair, that, it has been ſuppoſed by the vulgar to be an animated hair of that creature. Theſe creatures, ſuppoſed to be living hairs,are a peculiar ſort of infects, which are bred and nouriſhed within the Todies of other infects, as the worms of the ichneumon flies are in the bodies of the caterpillars.</p><p>Aldrovand deſcribes the creature, and tells us it was unknown to the ancients ; but called <hi rend="italic">ſeta aquatica,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vermis setarius,</hi> by the moderns, either from its figure reſembling that of a hair, or from the ſupposition of its once having been the hair of some animal. We generally ſuppoſe it, in the imaginary ſtate of the hair, to have belonged to a horſe ; but the Germans ſay it was once the hair of a calf, and call it by a name signifying <hi rend="italic">vitulus aquaticus,</hi> or the “ water calf.”</p><p>Albertus, an author much reverenced by the common people, has declared that this animal is generated of a hair ; and adds, that any hair thrown into ſanding water, will, in a very little time, obtain life and motion. Other authors have diſſented from this opinion, and ſupposed them generated of the fibrous roots of water- plants ; and others, of the parts of graſshoppers fallen into the water. This laſt opinion is rejected by Al- drovand as the most improbable of all. Standing and foul waters are most plentifully ſtored with them ; but they are ſometimes found in the eleareſt and pureſt ſprings, and ſometimes out of the water, on the leaves of trees and plants, as on the fruit-trees in our gardens, and the elms in hedges. They are from three to five inches long, of the thickneſs of a large hair; and are</p></body></text></TEI>
