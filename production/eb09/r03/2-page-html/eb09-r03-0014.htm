        <p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Law during the Period.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Characteristics generally and Recognition
                of a Jus Naturale in particular.—</span><span class="font2">The first three
                centuries of the&nbsp;empire witnessed the perfection of Roman
                jurisprudence&nbsp;and the commencement of its decline. During that time&nbsp;the
                history of the law presents no such great landmarks&nbsp;as the enactment of the
                XII. Tables, the commencement&nbsp;of a praetor’s edict, the recognition of simple
                consent as&nbsp;creative of a contractual bond, or the introduction of a&nbsp;new
                form of judicial procedure; the establishment of a&nbsp;class of patented jurists
                speaking as the mouthpieces of&nbsp;the prince, and the admission of all the free
                subjects of the&nbsp;empire to the privileges of citizenship, are about the
                only&nbsp;isolated events to which one can point as productive of&nbsp;great and
                lasting results. There were, indeed, some radical&nbsp;changes in particular
                institutions, such as the caduciary&nbsp;legislation of Augustus, intended to raise
                the tone of&nbsp;domestic morality and increase fruitful marriages, and
                the&nbsp;legislation of the same emperor and his immediate successor for regulation
                of the status of enfranchised slaves;&nbsp;but these, although of vast importance in
                themselves, and&nbsp;the first of them influencing the current of the law
                for&nbsp;centuries, yet left upon it no permanent impression. It&nbsp;was by much
                less imposing efforts that it attained the&nbsp;perfection to which it reached under
                the sovereigns of the&nbsp;Severan house,—a steady advance on the lines
                already&nbsp;marked out in the latter years of the republic. The&nbsp;sphere of the
                </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus Quiritium</span><span
                class="font2"> became more and more circumscribed, and one after another of the
                formalities of&nbsp;the jus </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
                >civile</span><span class="font2"> was abandoned. The </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font2"> of the
                husband&nbsp;practically disappeared; the </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas</span><span class="font2"> of the
                father&nbsp;lost much of its significance by the recognition, notwithstanding it, of
                the possibility of a separate and independent estate in the child; slaves might be
                enfranchised by&nbsp;informal manumission; </span><span class="font2"

                by&nbsp;simple tradition, the right of the transferee being secured&nbsp;by the

                maintained as effectual </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"

                and&nbsp;many of the incidental bargains incident to consensual&nbsp;contract, but
                varying their natural import, that used to be&nbsp;embodied in words of stipulation,
                came to be enforcible on&nbsp;the strength of formless contemporaneous
                agreements.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The preference accorded by jurists and judges to the </span><span
                class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium,</span><span class="font2">
                over thejws </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">civile</span><span
                class="font2"> is insufficient to account for&nbsp; these and many other changes in
                the same direction, as&nbsp;well as for the ever-increasing tendency evinced to
                subordinate word and deed to the </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">voluntas</span><span class="font2"> from which
                they&nbsp;arose. They are rather to be attributed to the striving&nbsp;on the part
                of many after a higher ideal, to which they&nbsp;gave the name of </span><span
                class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus naturale.@@<sup>1</sup></span><span
                class="font2"> It is sometimes said that&nbsp;the notion of a </span><span
                class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus naturale</span><span class="font2"> as
                distinct from the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus
                gentium&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">was peculiar to Ulpian, and that it found no
                acceptance&nbsp;with the Roman jurists generally. But this is
                inaccurate.&nbsp;Justinian, indeed, has excerpted in the </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">Digest</span><span class="font2"> and put in&nbsp;the
                forefront of his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
                >Institutes</span><span class="font2"> a passage from an elementary&nbsp;work of
                Ulpian’s, in which he speaks of a </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">jus naturale</span><span class="font2"> that&nbsp;is
                common to man and the lower animals, and which is&nbsp;substantially instinct. This
                is a law of nature of which it&nbsp;is quite true that we find no other jurist
                taking account.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">But many of them refer again and again to the</span><span
                class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus naturale-, </span><span class="font2"
                >and Gaius is the only one (Justinian following him) who&nbsp;occasionally makes it
                synonymous </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus
                gentium.</span><span class="font2"> There&nbsp;can be no question that the latter
                was much more largely&nbsp;imbued with precepts of natural law than was the
                </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus&nbsp;civile,</span><span
                class="font2"> but it is impossible to say they were identical; it&nbsp;is enough to
                cite but one illustration, pointed out again&nbsp;and again in the texts : while the
                one admitted the&nbsp;legality of slavery, the other denied it. While the
                </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile&nbsp;</span><span
                class="font2">studied the interests only of citizens, and the </span><span
                class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium&nbsp;</span><span class="font2"
                >those of freemen irrespective of nationality, the law of&nbsp;nature had
                theoretically a wider range and took all mankind within its purview. We have no hint
                that the doctrine of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus
                gentium</span><span class="font2"> differed in this respect from
                the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus
                civile—</span><span class="font2">that a slave was nothing but a chattel; yet
                we&nbsp;find the latter, -when tinctured with the </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">jus naturale,</span><span class="font2"> recognizing many
                rights as competent to a slave, and even&nbsp;conceding that he might be debtor or
                creditor in a contract, although his obligation or claim could be given
                effect&nbsp;to only indirectly, since he could neither sue nor be sued.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Voigt thus summarizes the characteristics of this speculative Roman
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus naturale</span><span
                class="font1">:—(1) its potential universal applicability to&nbsp;all men, (2) among
                all peoples, (3) at all times, and (4) its correspondence with the innate conviction
                of right </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{innere
                    Rechtsuber-zeugung}.@@<sup>2</sup>
            </span><span class="font1">Its propositions, as gathered from the pages of the
                jurists&nbsp;of the period, he formulates thus :—(1) recognition of the claims
                of&nbsp;blood </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{sanguinis vel
                cognationis ratio'}</span><span class="font1">; (2) duty of faithfulness
                to&nbsp;engagements,—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">is natura
                debct . . . cujus fidem secuti sumus;</span><span class="font1">
                (3)&nbsp;apportionment of advantage and disadvantage, gain and loss, according to
                the standard of equity ; (4) supremacy of the </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">voluntatis ratio&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">over the
                words or form in which the will is manifested.@@<sup>3</sup> It was&nbsp;regard for
                the first that, probably pretty early in the principate,&nbsp;led the prsetors to
                place emancipated children on a footing of perfect&nbsp;equality with unemancipated
                in the matter of succession, and to&nbsp;admit collateral kindred through females as
                well as those related&nbsp;through males ; and that, in the reigns of Hadrian and
                Marcus&nbsp;Aurelius respectively, induced the senate to give a mother a
                pre&nbsp;ferred right of succession to her children, and </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">vice versa.</span><span class="font1"> It
                was&nbsp;respect for the second that led to the recognition of the validity
                of&nbsp;what was called a natural obligation,—one that, because of some&nbsp;defect
                of form or something peculiar in the position of the parties,&nbsp;was ignored by
                the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span
                class="font1"> and incapable of being made the&nbsp;ground of an action for its
                enforcement, yet might be given effect&nbsp;to indirectly by other equitable
                remedies. Regard for the third&nbsp;was nothing new in the jurisprudence of the
                period ; the republic&nbsp;had already admitted it as a principle that a man was not
                to be&nbsp;unjustifiably enriched at another’s cost; the jurists of the
                empire,&nbsp;however, gave it a wider application than before, and used it as
                a&nbsp;key to the solution of many a difficult question in the domain of&nbsp;the
                law of contract. As for the fourth, it was one that had to be&nbsp;applied with
                delicacy ; for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >voluntas</span><span class="font1"> could not in equity be preferred to its
                manifestation to the prejudice of other parties who in&nbsp;good faith had acted
                upon the latter. We have many evidences&nbsp;of the skilful way in which the matter
                was handled, speculative&nbsp;opinion being held in check by considerations of
                individual interest&nbsp;and general utility.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">A remark of Voigt’s on the subject is well worthy of being kept in
                view, that the risk which arose from the setting up of the precepts of a speculative
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus naturale,</span><span
                class="font1"> as derogating from the rules of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">jus civile,</span><span class="font1"> was greatly
                diminished through the position held by&nbsp;the jurists of the early empire. Their
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus respondendi
                {infra,</span><span class="font1"> p. 705)&nbsp;made them legislative organs of the
                state, so that, in introducing&nbsp;principles of the </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">jus naturale,</span><span class="font1"> or of
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">acquum et bonum,</span><span
                class="font1"> they at the&nbsp;same moment positivized them and gave them the force
                of law.&nbsp;They were, he says, “philosophers in the sphere of law,
                searchers&nbsp;after the ultimate truth ; but, while they—usually in reference
                to&nbsp;a concrete case—sought out the truth and applied what they had&nbsp;found,
                they combined with the freedom and untrammelledness of&nbsp;speculation the
                life-freshness of practice and the power of assuring&nbsp;the operativeness of their
                abstract propositions.”@@<sup>4</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Influence of Constitutional
                Changes.—</span><span class="font1">The changes in the constitution aided not a
                little the current of the law. Men of foreign descent reached the throne and
                recruited the senate,—proud indeed&nbsp;of the history and traditions of Rome, yet
                in most cases free from&nbsp;prejudice in favour of institutions that had nothing to
                recommend&nbsp;them but their antiquity. Military life had not the same attractions
                as during the republic; there was no longer a tribunate to&nbsp;which men of
                ambition might aspire ; the comitia soon ceased to&nbsp;afford an outlet for public
                eloquence ; so that men of education and</span></p>
