is the produce of a large leguminous tree, <hi rend="italic">Lysiloma Sabicu,</hi> a native of Cuba, where alone it appears to be found. The wood has a rich mahogany colour; it is exceedingly heavy, hard, and durable, and therefore most valuable for shipbuilding. Sabicu, on account of its durability, was selected for the stairs of the Great Exhibition (London) of 1851, and, notwithstanding the enormous traffic which passed over them, the wood at the end was found to be little affected by wear.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
