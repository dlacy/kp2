            <p>15. Microstoma, Cuv. Body elongate, cylindrical, covered with large thin silvery
                scales. Cleft of mouth very small; premaxilla very small; maxillae very short and
                broad. Eye very large. Narrow series of very small teeth in the lower jaw and across
                the head of the vomer ; no other teeth. Dorsal fin short, inserted behind the
                ventrals, but before the anal; adipose fin present in most young specimens,
                frequently absent in old ones. Pseudobranchiae well developed; air-bladder large.
                Pyloric appendages absent ; mucous membrane of stomach with numerous large papillae.
                The genus is allied to <hi rend="italic">Argentina.</hi></p>
            <p>16. Bathylagus, a genus of deep sea Salmonoids discovered by the “Challenger” in the
                Atlantic and Antarctic Oceans at depths of 1950 and 2040 fathoms.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Species.</hi></p>
            <p>1. Genus Salmo. The difficulty of defining and distinguishing the species of this
                genus is considerable, and much diversity of opinion on the subject exists among
                ichthyologists. Many of the species are extremely variable, so that some individuals
                of one resemble the more aberrant individuals of another; the species are seldom
                separated by conspicuous differences. The individuals of a given species vary
                considerably with age and sex, and also with habitat and external conditions. Many
                of the species are capable of breeding together and producing fertile offspring. The
                characters which are most constant, and on whose differences the distinction of
                species chiefly rests, are as follows :—(1) the form of the præoperculum (the
                horizontal breadth of this bone at its lower portion is always small in the young,
                but in the adult it is greater in some species than in others; (2) width and
                strength of maxillary in adult); (3) size of teeth; (4) arrangement and permanence
                of vomerine teeth ; (5) form of caudal fin; (6) pectoral fins; (7) size of scales;
                (8) number of vertebra ; (9) number of pyloric appendages.</p>
            <p>In all the species of <hi rend="italic">Salmo</hi> there are teeth in the vomer. In
                the Salmons proper and in the Trouts there are, in the young, teeth both on the head
                and body of that bone, but in some species on the body only; some of the teeth on
                the body are deciduous, and are in most of the species shed at an early age. In the
                Charrs there are teeth on the head of the vomer but none on the body of the bone at
                any period of life, and none of the vomerine teeth are deciduous. The species of
                true Trout are confined to fresh water, and are not migratory. In accordance with
                these peculiarities some zoologists have divided the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salmo</hi> into three subgenera,—<hi rend="italic">Salmo</hi> sensu restricto,
                    <hi rend="italic">Fario,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Salvelinus.</hi> But modern
                authorities retain only two subdivisions,—the subgenera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salmo,</hi> including migratory Salmon and non-migratory Trout, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Salvelinus,</hi> the Charrs.</p>
            <p>A. Subgenus <hi rend="smallcaps">Salmo.</hi>—A vast number of species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Salmo</hi> have been described ; in the <hi rend="italic">Brit.
                    Mus. Cat.</hi> Dr Gunther distinguishes fifty-two, of which seven are confined
                to the British Islands and four are found both in the British Islands and other
                parts of the world. Mr Day on the other hand considers that all the indigenous
                Salmon and Trout of the British Islands belong to two species, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salmo salar</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Salmo trutta,—Salmo levenensis</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Salmo fario</hi> being varieties of the latter ; the rest of
                the described British species he considers as local varieties or subvarieties of
                these.</p>

            <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Salmo salar,</hi> L. (the Salmon). B. 11-12 ; D. 14 ; A. 11 ;

                    rend="superscript">1</hi> Attains to a length of 4 to 5 feet; female mature at a
                length of about 15 inches. Praoperculum with a distinct lower limb and with the
                angle rounded. Head of vomer subpentagonal, as long as broad, toothless ; the body
                of the bone with single series of small teeth which are gradually lost from behind
                forwards so that older examples only have from one to four left Hind part of body
                elongate and covered with relatively large scales. Young with about eleven dusky
                transverse bars on the sides ; half-grown and old specimens silvery, with small
                black spots in small number ; spawning males with numerous large black and red
                spots, some of the red spots confluent into more or less extensive patches,
                especially on the belly. An anadromous species, inhabiting temperate Europe
                southwards to 43° N. lat.; not found in Mediterranean ; in Asia and America
                southwards to 41° N. lat.</p>

            <p>No varieties of <hi rend="italic">Salmo salar</hi> are recognized in Europe, but in
                North America there occurs one Salmonoid which is considered by different
                authorities either as a variety or a sub-species, viz., <hi rend="italic">Salmo
                    salar,</hi> var. <hi rend="italic">sebago,</hi> L. lat. 115. Body and dorsal and
                caudal fins with subquadrangular or subcircular black spots. Is non-migratory and
                occurs in some of the lakes of Maine and New York in the United States ; these lakes
                have no communication with the sea. This form is called variously the Landlocked
                Salmon or the Schoodic Salmon.</p>
            <p>The true <hi rend="italic">Salmo salar</hi> on the American shore of the Atlantic is
                sometimes called the Penobscot Salmon.</p>

                Parnell <hi rend="italic">(Fishes of Firth of Forth)</hi> (Sea-Trout, Salmon-Trout,
                Bull-Trout). B. 11 ; D. 13 ; A. 11; P. 15 ; V. 9 ; L. lat. 120 ; L. transverse ;
                Vert. 59- 60; Cæc. pyl. 49-61. Attains to a length of about 3 feet; female mature at
                a length of 10 to 12 inches. Head of vomer triangular, as broad as long, toothless,
                body of the bone with a longitudinal ridge armed with a single series of teeth,
                which are deciduous ; generally only the two or three anterior ones found in
                examples of more than 20 inches in length. Silvery, sometimes immaculate, usually
                with more or less numerous X-shaped spots; spots on the head and dorsal fin round
                and readily disappearing. Young (parr) with nine or ten dusky cross bars ; grilse
                with top of dorsal and pectoral and with hind margin of caudal black. A migratory
                species, occurring in the rivers falling into the Baltic and German Ocean; numerous
                in Scotland, less frequent in English and Irish rivers.</p>

                    rend="subscript">28-40</hi>; Vert. 59; Caec. pyl. 39-47. Attaining to a length
                of 3 feet; female mature at a length of from 12 to 13 inches. Praoperculum with a
                distinct lower limb, with the angle rounded and with the hind margin convex or
                undulated, subvertical. Head of vomer triangular, broader than long, toothless in
                adult examples, armed with a few teeth across its hinder margin in young ones ; body
                of the bone with a sharp longitudinal ridge, in the sides of which the teeth are
                inserted, forming a single series, and alternately pointing to right and left. In
                pure-bred specimens these teeth are lost in the grilse state, so that only the two
                or three anterior remain in specimens more than 12 or 13 inches long. Fins of
                moderate length; caudal fin forked in parr stage, slightly emarginate in grilse,
                truncate in mature specimens. This species loses the parr marks very early, when
                only 5 to 6 inches long ; it is then bright silvery. Greenish on the back, with few
                small round black spots on the head and sides. This coloration remains nearly
                unaltered during the further growth of the fish, but the spots become more
                irregular, indistinctly X-shaped. An anadromous species, occurring in rivers of
                Norway, Denmark, Wales, and Ireland. Mr Day <hi rend="italic">{Fishes of Great
                    Britain)</hi> considers this form as merely a variety of <hi rend="italic">Salmo
                    trutta.</hi></p>
            <p>(4) <hi rend="italic">Salmo fario,</hi> L. (Trout). Dr Günther distinguishes two
                varieties :—</p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">(a) Salmo fario gaimardi; Salmo gaimardi,</hi> Cuv. and Val.; <hi

                triangular, small, broader than long ; vomerine teeth in a double series sometimes
                disposed in a zigzag line, persistent throughout life. Sides with numerous round or
                X-shaped black spots ; upper surface and sides of the head and the dorsal, adipose,
                and caudal fins usually with crowded round black spots ; dorsal, anal, and ventral
                with a black and white outer edge. Found in Iceland, North Britain, Ireland,
                Scandinavia.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">(b) Salmo fario ausonii ; Salmo ausonii,</hi> Cuv. and Val. (the

                moderately strong ; the head of the vomer triangular with a transverse series of two
                or three teeth across its base ; the teeth of the body of the vomer form a single
                series and are persistent throughout life. Upper parts brownish or greenish olive ;
                sides of the head with round black spots ; sides of the body with X-shaped,
                sometimes rounded, brown spots. Dorsal and adipose fins with numerous small brown
                spots. A non-migratory species, inhabiting Loch Leven and other lakes of southern
                Scotland and northern England. This species is considered by Mr Day as a variety of

                scarcely a trace of lower limb. Teeth rather strong; those of the vomer in double
                series, but in zigzag line. Most of them are lost in specimens 17 inches long, only
                a few of the anterior remaining. Sides of the body with X-shaped or ocellated black
                spots, some red spots along and below’ the lateral line ; dorsal fin with round
                black spots. Dorsal, anal, and ventral fins with a white and black outer margin in
                young examples. A migratory species, from the rivers Forth, Tweed, and Ouse.
                According to Mr Day, it is identical with the White Salmon of Pennant and <hi
