<p><span class="font0">has been released once more and has made war on the holy city he is for ever overthrown and the last judgment follows (xx.). In&nbsp;xxi∙-xxii. 5 the glory of the heavenly and eternal Jerusalem is set&nbsp;forth. In xxii. 6-21 several epilogues may be detected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Unity and Integrity.—</span><span class="font1">The above analysis will have shown the essential unity of the book. The more attentively we scan the connexion of the descriptions with each&nbsp;other the more clearly do we perceive the unity, the&nbsp;artistic and systematic arrangement, of the book. This is&nbsp;completely overlooked by those who fancy that in the&nbsp;seven seals, the seven trumpets, the seven vials of wrath,&nbsp;the whole course of the judgment is simply repeated in&nbsp;ever new imagery. Leaving all other objections out of&nbsp;account, this supposition is refuted by the simple observation that the author has not merely placed the different&nbsp;scenes side by side but has linked them together in such&nbsp;a way that each scene follows as a consequence from the&nbsp;scene before. A correct perception of the plan of the&nbsp;book further negatives the opinion of older scholars and&nbsp;of Völter in modern times </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Die Entstehung der Apokalypse,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">1882) that the book consists of different parts by different&nbsp;authors.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> But it is probable enough that the work has&nbsp;been interpolated and touched up in various places&nbsp;(certainly in i. 1-3) ; and several verses of the epilogue&nbsp;(xxii. 6-21) are not by the author of the book, as indeed&nbsp;the language itself is sufficient to prove. Unless we are&nbsp;utterly deceived, the book underwent systematic if not&nbsp;very radical revisions even before the middle of the 2d&nbsp;century.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> To the additions then made belong, amongst&nbsp;others, the famous words (xix. 13) καί. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">κεκKgται </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">όνομα&nbsp;αυτόν</span><span class="font1"> ό λόγος </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">τον 6εοv,</span><span class="font1"> which do not fit into the passage.&nbsp;An exact investigation of the extent of the alterations and&nbsp;additions would be a very useful work.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Language.—</span><span class="font1">The language is more Hebraic than that of any other New Testament book. The author thought in&nbsp;Hebrew and wrote in Greek. But the gross violations of&nbsp;Greek grammar are not to be explained from ignorance.&nbsp;“ In the language of the Apocalypse there is nothing of the&nbsp;bungling and happy-go-lucky style of a beginner ; indeed&nbsp;it bears the stamp of consistency and purpose.” The&nbsp;author writes, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g, χάρις</span><span class="font1"> καi </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ειρήνη άπό</span><span class="font1"> ό </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ωv κα,ϊ ό ήν καί</span><span class="font1"> ό&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ερχόμενος καί από των επτά πνευμάτων . . . και άπό Ιησον&nbsp;Χρίστον,</span><span class="font1"> ό </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">μάρτνς, ό πιστός</span><span class="font1"> (i. 4, 5), although he has shown&nbsp;in a hundred passages that he knew very well the rules&nbsp;which he has here broken. He must have deliberately&nbsp;intended to break them in order to give to the words of&nbsp;his greeting a certain elevation and solemnity. Of course&nbsp;only to a foreigner could it have occurred to employ those&nbsp;means for this end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Author’s Standpoint.—</span><span class="font1">That the book is not written by a disciple of the apostle Paul, that its author is filled with&nbsp;Jewish hatred and abhorrence of the heathen state, that in&nbsp;other ways traces of the Jewish spirit crop up here and&nbsp;there in the Apocalypse, is beyond question. But many&nbsp;critics, especially the so-called Tübingen school, as well as&nbsp;Renan, Mommsen, and others, have gone still farther ; the&nbsp;author of the Apocalypse, say they, was an Ebionite and a&nbsp;decided opponent of the apostle Paul. In support of this&nbsp;hypothesis, which they put forward as if it were an&nbsp;established truth, they appeal chiefly to the following&nbsp;observations :—(1) in ch. vii. only 144,000 Jews are sealed,&nbsp;therefore the author regarded only born Jews as full&nbsp;members of the Messiah’s kingdom ; consequently (ver. 9 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sq.)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the multitude which is not numbered forms a wider circle,&nbsp;viz., the proselytes, λvho are not counted and also not&nbsp;sealed, and are therefore of lower rank ; (2) in ii.-iii. the&nbsp;author displays the greatest abhorrence of those who eat&nbsp;meat which has been offered to idols and who practise&nbsp;“ fornication ” ; by these none but disciples of Paul can be&nbsp;meant; (3) in xxi. 14 the author speaks only of twelve&nbsp;apostles, and thereby undoubtedly excludes Paul ; (4) the&nbsp;author praises (ii. 2) the Ephesians because they have&nbsp;found the false apostles to be liars and have rejected&nbsp;them, but by these false apostles only Paul could be&nbsp;meant; (5) the author cannot conceive (xi. 1, 2) that the&nbsp;temple at Jerusalem should ever be destroyed, and proves&nbsp;by this how much he himself still clung to the temple&nbsp;worship.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Theol. Lit.-Zeitung,</span><span class="font0"> 1882, No. 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The redaction of the Apocalypse took place long before Irenæus&nbsp;(before 185 a.D.), for it can be shown that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">σπουδαία καl αρχαία&nbsp;aviyρaφa</span><span class="font0"> to which he appeals already exhibited the Apocalypse in&nbsp;the form in which we now read it (Iren., v. 30).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>3</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state of the text is much more uncertain than in most of the&nbsp;New Testament books, because there are far fewer uncial MSS. of our&nbsp;book than of the Gospels and Epistles ; in fact there are only five, of&nbsp;which only three are complete. The best MSS. are the Sinaitic, the&nbsp;Alexandrine, and the Ephraemi Parisiensis (incomplete). The so-called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">textus receptus</span><span class="font0"> of the Apocalypse is especially bad, owing to&nbsp;causes which Delitzsch was the first to point out </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Olandsehriftliehe&nbsp;Funde,</span><span class="font0"> 1861-62).</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">The point in dispute is of the highest importance for the proper understanding of the history of primitive&nbsp;Christianity. If the Tübingen school is right, the&nbsp;Pauline epoch was followed in Asia Minor by an Ebionitic&nbsp;epoch, and in this case Catholicism may very well be the&nbsp;product of a compromise between Paulinism and Jewish&nbsp;Christianity. But on this very point it can be clearly&nbsp;shown that the Tübingen school is in the wrong ; for the&nbsp;above arguments amount to nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(1) The 12×12,000 (vii. 4 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sq.)</span><span class="font0"> can only, like James i. 1, be interpreted allegorically and referred to Christians generally without respect of nationality ; the twelve tribes are the Christians. This&nbsp;interpretation is the only possible one, because (a) in xiv. 3 it&nbsp;is said of the 144,000 that they are bought from the earth, and&nbsp;because (5) besides the 144,000 who are sealed no one survives the&nbsp;horrors of the last time. We must not overlook the fact that in&nbsp;ch. vii. two entirely different visions are presented, which are not&nbsp;to be fused into a single vision : the 144,000 are on earth, the&nbsp;unnumbered multitude (ver. 9 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sq.</span><span class="font0"> ) are not a supplement of these&nbsp;144,000, but are already in heaven and represent the sum of all the&nbsp;children of God from the beginning. Thus, if the 144,000 were&nbsp;exclusively Jews, in the last time there would be no Christian at all&nbsp;from among the heathen ; that is, no heathen would be saved. But&nbsp;that this is the author’s meaning not even the Tübingen critics can&nbsp;maintain. Thus the “ twelve tribes ” are to be understood allegorically. Λs Abraham is the father of all believers, so all believers&nbsp;make up the nation of the twelve tribes. (2) The polemic against&nbsp;the eating of meat offered to idols and against “fornication” is not&nbsp;peculiar to the author, but is to be found in several early Christian&nbsp;writings. It is not a polemic against Paul ; at most it is a polemic&nbsp;against lax disciples of Paul ; further it is no sign of Ebionitism, for&nbsp;very many Gentile Christian writers of the 2d century </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{e.g.,</span><span class="font0"> Justin)&nbsp;combated the eating of meat offered to idols. The rule mentioned&nbsp;in Acts xv. 29 may really have been made between 58 aud 70 a.d.,&nbsp;and may have been a condition of intercourse between Jewish and&nbsp;Gentile Christians. After that time it gradually prevailed all over&nbsp;Christendom. (3) In the ideal description of the new Jerusalem it&nbsp;would have been impossible for the author to speak of thirteen&nbsp;apostles. (4) The plural </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">απόστολοι</span><span class="font0"> (ii. 2) shows that Paul is not&nbsp;meant, and the comparison with ii. 9 and iii. 9 makes it probable&nbsp;that Jewish emissaries are intended. But, apart from this, we see&nbsp;better than heretofore by the newly discovered </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Teaching of the&nbsp;Apostles</span><span class="font0"> that the name “apostle” was not confined to the twelve&nbsp;apostles and Paul. If the author had wished to express abhorrence&nbsp;of Paul lie could not have done it more obscurely than he has done&nbsp;it in ii. 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The author says expressly (xxi. 22) that he saw no</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">temple in the new Jerusalem, “ for the Lord is her temple and the Lamb”; hence he felt that the temple worship was no longer&nbsp;needed to satisfy his religious wants ; in excepting the temple&nbsp;buildings from the universal destruction (xi. 1) he follows a Jewish&nbsp;notion, to which in his heart he has already risen superior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The arguments to prove the Ebionitism of the Apocalypse are therefore insufficient; rather, we should say, the Apocalypse shows us a Christianity free from the law, free&nbsp;from national prejudices, universal, and yet a Christianity&nbsp;which is quite independent of Paul. It is this that constitutes the high importance of the book. The author speaks&nbsp;not at all of the law—the word does not occur in his work ;&nbsp;he looks for salvation from the power and grace of God and</span></p>
