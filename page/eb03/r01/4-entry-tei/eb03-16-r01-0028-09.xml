<p><label>RECHABITES</label>
a kind of religious order among the ancient Jews, inftituted by Jonadab the fon of Re-chab, comprehending only his own family and poſteri-ty. Their founder preſcribed them three things : firft, not to drink any wine; fecondly, not to build any houſes, but to dwell in tents ; and thirdly, not to ſow any corn, or plant vines.</p><p>The Rechabites obſerved theſe rules with great ſtrict-neſs, as appears from Jer. xxxv. <hi rend="italic">6,</hi> &amp;c. whence St. Jerome, in his 13th epiſtle to Paulinus, calls them <hi rend="italic">mona-chi, monks.</hi> Jonadab, their founder, lived under Jehoaſh,. king of Judah, contemporary with Jehu king of Iſrael; his father Rechab, from whom his poſterity were denominated, defcended from Raguel or Jethro, father-in-law to Mofes, who was a Kenite, or of the race of Ken r whence Kenite and Rechabite are uſed as ſynonymous in Scripture.</p>
