If ſucceſsful, they are then on the foundation, and are entitled to become candidates for ſellowſhips when they have got that degree. In the mean time, while they continue ſizars, beſides free commons they enjoy many beneſactions, which have been made at different times, under the name of si<hi rend="italic">zar's praetor, exhibitions,</hi> &amp;c. and the rate of tuition, the rent of rooms, and other things of that sort within their reſpective colleges, is leſs than to the other orders. But tho’ their education is thus obtained at a leſs expence, they are not now conſidered as a menial order; for ſizars, penſioner-ſcholars, and even sometimes fellow-commoners, mix together with the utmoſt cordiality. It is worthy of remark, that at every period this order has supplied the univerſity with its moſt diſtinguiſhed officers ; and that many of the moſt illuſtrious members of the church, many of the moſt diſtinguiſhed men in the other liberal proſeſſions, have, when under-graduates, been ſizars, when that order was on a leſs reſpectable footing than it is now.</p><p>SIZE, the name oſ an inſtrument uſed for finding the bigneſs of fine round pearls. It conſiſts of thin pieces or leaves, about two inches long, and half an inch broad, faſtened together at one end by a rivet. In each of theſe are round holes drilled oſ different diameters. Thoſe in the firſt leaf ſerve for meaſuring pearls from half a grain to ſeven grains ; thoſe of the ſecond, for pearls from eight grains or two carats to five carats, &amp;c. ; and thoſe of the third, for pearls from  six carats and a half to eight carats and a half.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Size,</hi> is also a sort of paint, varniſh, or glue, uſed by painters, &amp;c</p><p>The shreds and parings of leather, parchment, or vellum, being boiled in water and ſtrained, make ſize. This ſubſtance is much uſed in many trades. — The manner of using ſize is to melt ſome of it over a gentle fire ; and ſcraping as much whiting into it as will just colour it, let them be well incorporated together ; after which you may whiten frames, &amp;c. with it. After it dries, melt the ſize again, and put more whiting, and whiten the frames, &amp;c. ſeven or eight times, letting it dry between each time: but before it is quite dry, between each waffling with ſize, you muſt ſmoothe and wet it over with a clean bruſh-pencil in fair water.</p><p>To make gold-size. Take gum-animi and aſphaltum, of each one ounce ; minium, litharge of gold,  and amber, of each half an ounce : reduce all into a very fine powder, and add to them four ounces of linſeed-oil, and eight ounces of drying oil : digeſt them over a gentle fire that does not flame, ſo that the mixture may only ſimmer, but not boil ; left it ſhould run over and ſet the houſe on fire, ſtir it constantly with a ſtick till all the ingredients are diſſolved and incorporated, and do not leave off ſtirring till it becomes thick and ropy ; after being ſufficiently boiled, let it ſtand till it is almoſt cold, and then strain it through a coarſe linen cloth, and keep it for uſe.—To prepare it for working, put what quantity you pleaſe in a horſe-muſcle ſhell, adding as much oil of turpentine as will diſſolve it ; and making it as thin as the bottom of your ſeed-lac varniſh, hold it over a candle, and then ſtrain it through a linen-rag into another ſhell ; add to theſe as much vermilion as will make</p><p>it of a darkiſh red : if it is too thick for drawing, you may thin it with ſome oil of turpentine. The chief uſe of this ſize is for laying on metals.</p><p>The beſt gold-ſize for burniſhing is made as follows: Take fine bole, what quantity you pleaſe ; grind it finely on a piece of marble, then ſcrape into it a little beef ſuet ; grind all well together ; after which mix is a ſmall proportion of parchment-size with a double proportion of water, and it is done.</p><p>To make silver-size. Take tobacco-pipe clay in fine powder, into which ſcrape ſome black-lead and a little Genoa soap, and grind them all together with parchment ſize as already directed.</p><p>SKATING, an exerciſe on ice, both graceful and healthy. Although the ancients were remarkable for their dexterity in moſt of the athletic ſports, yet skating ſeems to have been unknown to them. It may therefore be conſidered as a modern invention ; and probably it derived its origin in Holland, where it was practiſed, not only as a graceful and elegant amuſement, but as an expeditious mode of travelling when the lakes and canals were frozen up during winter. In Holland long journeys are made upon ſkates with eaſe and expedition ; but in general less attention is there paid to graceful and elegant movements, than to the expedition and celerity of what is called journey <hi rend="italic">ſkating.</hi> It is only in thoſe countries where it is conſidered as an amuſement, that its graceful attitudes and movements can be ſtudied ; and there is no exerciſe whatever better calculated to ſet off the human figure to advantage. The acquirement of moſt exerciſes may be attained at an advanced period of life ; but to become an expert skater, it is neceſſary to begin the practice of the art at a very early age. It is difficult to reduce the art of skating to a ſyſtem. It is principally by the imitation of a good ſkater that a young practitioner can form his own practice. The Engliſh, though often remarkable for feats of agility upon ſkates, are very deficient in gracefulneſs ; which is partly owing to the conſtruction of the ſkates. They are too much curved in the surface which embraces the ice, conſequently they involuntarily bring the tilers of them round on the outſide upon a quick and ſmall circle ; whereas the ſkater, by uſing ſkates of a different conſtruction, leſs curved, has the command of his ſtroke, and can enlarge or diminiſh the circle according to his own wiſh and desire. The metropolis of Scotland has produced more inſtances of elegant ſkaters than perhaps any other country whatever; and the inſtitution of a Skating Club about 40 years ago, has contributed not a little to the improvement of this elegant amuſement. We are indebted for this article to a gentleman of that Club, who has made the practice and improvement of ſkating his particular ſtudy ; and as the nature oſ our work will not permit the inſertion of a full treatiſe on ſkating, we ſhall preſent our readers with a few inſtructions.</p><p>Thoſe who wiſh to be proficients ſhould begin at an early period of life ; and ſhould firſt endeavour to throw off the fear which always attends the commencement of an apparently hazardous amuſement. They will ſoon acquire a facility of moving on the inside : when they have done this, they muſt endeavour to acquire the movement on the outſide of the ſkates; which is nothing more than throwing themſelves upon the outer edge of the ſkate, and making the balance of their body tend towards that</p></body></text></TEI>
