<p><span class="font0">we may preſume that t∩e formula gives the greateſt velocities which can be expected. In ordinary works,&nbsp;where joints are rough or leaky, where drops of ſolder&nbsp;hang in the inſide, where cocks intervene with deficient water-ways, where pipes have âukward bendings,&nbsp;contractions, or enlargements, and where they may contain fand or air, we ſhould reckon on a ſmaller velocity&nbsp;than what reſults from our calculation ; and we preſume&nbsp;that an undertaker may with confidence promiſe ∣ of&nbsp;this quantity without any rifl&lt; of diſappointing his employer. We imagine that the actual performance of&nbsp;canals will be much nearer to the formula.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have made inquiry after works of this kind executed in Britain, that we might compare them with the formula. But all our canals are locked and without&nbsp;motion ; and we have only learned by an accidental information from Mr Watt, that a canal in his neighbourhood, which is 18 feet wide at the ſurface, and ſe-ven feet at the bottom, and four feet deep, and has a&nbsp;ſlope of one inch in a quarter of a mile, runs with the&nbsp;velocity of 17 inches per ſecond at the ſurface, 10 at&nbsp;the bottom, and 1 4 in the middle. If we compute&nbsp;the motion of this canal by our formula, we ſhall find&nbsp;the mean velocity to be 13-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No river in the world has had its motions ſo much ſcrutiniſed as the Pυ about the end of the laſt century.&nbsp;It had been a ſubject of 100 years continual litigation&nbsp;between the inhabitants of the Bologneſe and the Fer-rareſe, whether the waters of the Rheno ſhould be&nbsp;thrown into the Tronco de Venezia or Po Grande.&nbsp;This occaſioned very numerous meaſures to be taken of&nbsp;its ſections and declivity, and the quantities of water&nbsp;which it contained in its different liâtes of fullneſs.&nbsp;But, unfortunately, the long eſtabliſhed methods of&nbsp;meaſuring waters, which were in force in Lombardy,&nbsp;made no account of the velocity, and not all the intreaties of Caſtelli, Grandi, and other moderns, could prevail&nbsp;on the viſitors in this proceſs to deviate from the eſtabliſhed methods. We have therefore no minute accounts&nbsp;of its velocity, though there are many rough eſtimates&nbsp;to be met with in that valuable collection publiſhed at&nbsp;Florence in 1723, of the writings on the motion of&nbsp;rivers. From them we have extracted the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">only preciſe&nbsp;obſervations</span><span class="font0"> which are to be found in the whole work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Po Grande receives no river from Stellata to the ſea, and its ſlope in that interval is found moſt ſur-priſingly uniform, namely fix inches in the mile (reduced to Engliſh meaſure). The breadth in its great&nbsp;freſhes is 759 ſeet at Lago Scuro, with a very uniform&nbsp;depth of 31 ſeet. In its loweſt ſtate (in which it is&nbsp;called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Po Magra),</span><span class="font0"> its breadth is not leſs than 70c,&nbsp;and its depth about 10⅛.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Rheno has a uniform declivity from the Ponte Emilio to Vigarano of 1 ς inches per mile. Its breadth&nbsp;in its greateſt freſhes is 189 ſeet, and its depth 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Signor Corrade in his report ſays, that in the ſtate of the great freſhes the velocity of the Rheno is moſt&nbsp;exactly I of that of the Po.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Grandi ſays that a great freſh in the Rheno employs 12 hours (by many obſervations of his own) to come&nbsp;from Ponte Emilio to Vigarano, which is 30 miles.&nbsp;This is a velocity of 44 inches per ſecond. And, by&nbsp;Corrade’s proportion, the velocity of the. Po Grande&nbsp;muſt be 55 inches per ſecond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Montanan’s obſervation gives the Po Magra a velocity of 3</span><span class="font1">1 </span><span class="font0">inches per ſecond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let us compare theſe velocities with the velocities calculated by Buat’s formula.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The hydraulic mean depths </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0"> and D of the Rheno and Po in the great freſhes deduced from the above&nbsp;meaſures, are 98,6 and 344 inches ; and their ſlopes&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span class="font0"> and S are <sub>τr</sub>√<sub>τ7</sub> and τc⅛5∙ This will give&nbsp;= 52,176 inches&nbsp;307 ( V<sup>z</sup></span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0">—o,ι )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>z</sub>_</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>and</sup> √r∑L√7+T6-°&gt;3 (V<sup>j</sup>-°∙') =46,727 inches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theſe reſults differ very little from the velocities above mentioned. And if the velocity correſponding&nbsp;to a depth of 31 feet be deduced from that obſerved&nbsp;by Montanari in the Po Magra 10 ſeet deep, on the&nbsp;ſuppoſition that they are in the proportion of V<sup>z</sup></span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d,</span><span class="font0"> it&nbsp;will be found to be about 53∙∣ inches per ſecoad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This compariſon is therefore highly to the credit oſ the theory, and would have been very agreeable to&nbsp;M. de Buat, had he known it, as we,hope it is to our&nbsp;readers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have collected many accounts of water pipes, and made the compariſons, and we flatter ourſelves that theſe&nbsp;have enabled us to improve the theory. They ſhall appear in their proper place; and we may juſt obſerve&nbsp;here, that the two-inch pipe, which we formerly ſpokc&nbsp;of as conveying the water to Dunbar, ſhould have yielded only 25 * Scotch pints per minute by the formula,&nbsp;inſtead of-27; a ſmall error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have, therefore, no heſitation in ſaying that this ſingle formula of the uniform motion of water is one&nbsp;of the moſt valuable preſents which natural ſcience and&nbsp;the arts have received during the courſe of this century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We hoped to have made this fortunate inveſtigation of the chevalier de Buat ſtill more acceptable to our&nbsp;readers by another table, which ſhould contain the va-307</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">lues of —τ-÷—-—7</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:line-through;">-ττ—-</span><span class="font0">. ready calculated for every de-V j — Lv j-J- 1,6</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">clivity that can occur in water pipes, canals, or rivers. Aided by this, which ſuperſedes the only difficult part&nbsp;of the computation, a perſon could calculate the velocity for any propoſed caſe in leſs than two minutes.&nbsp;But we have not been able to get it ready for 1t3 appeal ance in this article, but we ſhall not fail to give it&nbsp;when we relume the ſubject in' the article </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">WATER-Works ;</span><span class="font0"> and we hope even to give its reſults on a ſcale&nbsp;which may be carried in the pocket, and will enable&nbsp;the unlearned practitioner to lolve any queſtion with&nbsp;accuracy in half a minute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">W<sup>r</sup></span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">e have now eſtabliſhed in ſome meaſure a Theory of Hydraulics, by exhibiting a general theorem&nbsp;which expreſſes the relation of the chief circumſtances&nbsp;of all ſuch motions as have attained a ſtate of permanency, in ſo far as this depends on the magnitude,,&nbsp;form, and ſlope of the channel. This permanency we&nbsp;have expreſſed by the term traih, ſaying that the ſtream&nbsp;is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in train.</span></p>
