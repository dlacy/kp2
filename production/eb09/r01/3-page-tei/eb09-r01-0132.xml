            <p>Clemenges deplores in the strongest terms the state of the church in his day,—a
                condition of appalling degeneracy, which he ascribes mainly to the increase in
                wealth and luxury that had followed upon the development of a worldly spirit in its
                midst. His strictures leave no order or degree of either the ecclesiastical or the
                monastic life untouched,—the overwhelming ostentation of the Curia; the pride and
                rapacity of the cardinals, their immorality and addiction to simony ; the prevalence
                of the same vices among the episcopal order, filled with beardless youths, who,
                scarcely liberated from the dread of the schoolmaster’s ferule, hastened to assume
                the pastoral office; the lower clergy in general so sunk in vice and sloth
                that scarcely one in a thousand (“ vix inter mille unus ”) was to be found living a
                godly and sober life; the nunneries, which he declares were brothels rather than
                sanctuaries (“ non dico Dei sanctuaria, sed Veneris execranda prostibula ”). We can
                feel no surprise at finding that in the 16th century Clement VII. thought it
                necessary to place this burning diatribe by a great doctor of the church in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Index Expurgatorius.</hi>A few years later
                we find the evils to which Clemenges called attention emphasized by one of the
                most eminent ecclesiastics of the age, — the cardinal Julian Cesarini, when he was
                endeavouring to dissuade Pope Eugenius IV. from his design of dissolving the council
                of Basel (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Popedom, </hi>vol. xix. p. 502). In this letter
                he affirms that so strongly is popular feeling stirred against the clergy by their
                neglect of their duties and scandalously immoral lives that there is reason to fear
                that, if some remedy be pot devised, the whole fabric of the Roman Church may be
                    overturned.@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi></p>
            <p>The complete failure of these successive efforts to bring about any comprehensive
                measure of church reform is a familiar fact in European history. And not only were
                the evils which it was sought to abolish suffered to continue with but little
                abatement, but dissent even from the recognized discipline of the church was placed
                under a ban, and made, in common with dissent from doctrine, an offence punishable
                with the severest penalties. The mediaeval theory of the Roman hierarchy had indeed
                been reaffirmed by Eugenius IV. and his successors with a success which seemed
                almost to preclude the possibility of its ever being again challenged. But the main
                point here to be noted is that in none of these several efforts in the direction
                of reform, whether resulting from conciliar or popular action, was the doctrine of
                the church once called in question. The fate that overtook John Huss and Jerome of
                Prague appears to have been very generally regarded as a necessary example of just
                rigour in the suppression of heresy. We find, accordingly, that, when in the
                following century it was sought to associate the efforts of the reformers in the
                direction of doctrinal change with the efforts of a party within the church itself
                in the direction of disciplinary reform, the defenders of the traditional Catholic
                faith challenged the assumed precedent and altogether denied the parallel. “ It is,”
                wrote Bossuet in the 17th century, “an obvious illusion; for
                among all the passages which they adduce there is not one in which those teachers
                have ever dreamed of changing the belief of the church, of amending its worship,
                which consisted chiefly in the sacrifice of the mass, or of overthrowing the
                authority of her prelates and especially that of the pope, all which was the
                primary design of this new reformation of which Luther was the architect.” @@<hi
                    rend="sup">2</hi> It is not easy to gainsay the reasonableness of Bossuet’s
                criticism. It was the fundamental theory of ' the Reformation that it involved the
                setting aside of the development given in mediaeval times to the doctrines
                and teaching of the early church, and proposed to substitute for these a totally
                different interpretation, which rejected the successive decisions of councils and
                popes as arbitrary and erroneous. Such a theory, however, necessarily imposed on the
                Reformers the task of proving the validity of their own position, by showing that
                their repudiation of a practice and of precedents which had been accepted for so
                many centuries was justified by an appeal to yet more ancient and unquestionable
                authority. If indeed they failed in so doing, they must look forward to sinking
                in the estimation of Christendom to the level of heretics, and be prepared to stand
                before posterity in the same category as the Arians, the Albigenses, the Lollards,
                and the Hussites, and those other sects which, by their unwarranted assertion of the
                right of private interpretation, had provoked and incurred the formal condemnation
                of the church. It is not within the scope of this article to attempt to estimate the
                justice of the theological arguments by which the Reformers sought to vindicate
                their position; but there is good reason for concluding that the argumentative
                powers and personal influence of Luther and Calvin would have failed, just as the
                efforts of preceding reformers had failed, in effecting the desired result, had not
                the conditions and circumstances of the age been such as to lend new force to the
                arguments which they urged in favour of a fundamental change in the standpoint of
                religious faith.</p>

            <lb/>
            <p>The most notable feature in connexion with traditional belief which challenges our
                attention at the commencement of the 16th century is the manner in which the popedom
                was becoming less and less in harmony with the spirit of the age, and with those new
                forces which were now developing in the midst of Teutonism. The intolerance of the
                church in the repression of heresy had become more pronounced and was pressing with
                increasing rigour on free thought, when, owing to the influences of the New
                Learning, that thought was everywhere on the point of seeking to break through the
                traditional trammels; the corruption of the Curia and of both the regular and
                the secular clergy, the extension of the temporal power of the pontiffs in Italy,
                and the extortion of their emissaries in other countries had reached a climax just
                as, owing to the more independent spirit generated by the consolidation of the
                nationalities, the ruler and the people in each kingdom or principality were
                becoming increasingly impatient of the existence of such abuses. A brief
                consideration of these several features becomes, accordingly, quite indispensable,
                if we wish rightly to comprehend the forces at work in Europe at the time when the
                Reformers arose to combine them and give them more definite direction.</p>
            <p>Not a few, and some very memorable, efforts had been made before the 16th century to
                bring about a reformation of doctrine, but these had almost invariably been
                promptly visited with the censure of the church. Long after the “ heresies ” of the
                4th century had died away and after the controversies of the turbulent 9th
                century—such as those on the Eucharist between Paschasius Radbertus and Ratramnus,
                and on predestination between John Scotus Erigena and Gottschalk—had been silenced
                by the decisions of the pontiffs, we find movements arising, which, however much
                they differ in other characteristics, all attest the existence of a widespread
                desire among large sections of the community to revert to a simpler form of
                i־eligious belief and practice. The Paulicians (or Manichaeans of the East), the
                Albigenses (or Manichaeans of the West), the Waldenses, the Cathari, and the
                Leonists (or Poor Men of Lyons)—sects which made their appearance mainly in the 12th
                and 13th centuries, and for the most part in Switzerland, Languedoc, and northern
                France—the</p>
