Again, from the interſection of the cant line, with the level line for the wing tranſom in the half breadth plan, draw a perpendicular to the wing tranſom in the sheer-plan. Alſo draw perpendiculars from the points where the cant line in the half-breadth plan interſects the level line below the wing tranſom, and alſo the water lines to the correſponding lines in the ſheer plan ; then a curve deſcribed through theſe points will be the repreſentation of the foremoſt faſhion-piece in the ſheer plan. In the ſame manner the middle and after ſaſhion-pieces may be deſcribed ; observing to let the middle one run up no higher than the under part of the deck tranſom, and the after to the under side of the fourth tranſom under the deck. The tranſoms may now be drawn with ink, as their lengths</p><p>are limited by the faſhion-pieces.</p><p>Neither the head nor the foreſide of the ſternpoſt are yet deſcribed ; take, therefore, from the dimenſions, the breadth of the poſt on the keel, and ſet it off on the upper edge of the keel from the aft ſide of poſt. The head of the poſt muſt next be determined, which muſt juſt be high enough to admit of the helm-poſt tranſom and the tiller coming between it and the upper deck beam ; the height therefore that is neceſſary will be one foot nine inches above the wing tranſom. Now draw a level line at that height, upon which ſet off the breadth of the ſternpoſt at that place, taken from the dimenſions, and a line drawn from thence to the point ſet off on the keel will be the foreſide of the ſternpoſt ; obſerving, however, not to draw the line through the tranſoms, as it will only appear between them. The inner poſt may be drawn, by ſetting off its thickneſs forward from the ſternpoſt, and drawing a ſtraight line as before, continuing it no higher than the under ſide of the wing tranſom.</p><p>The cant-timbers in the aſter body being deſcribed, together with the parts dependent on them, thoſe in the fore body may be next formed ; in order to which, the foremoſt and aftermoſt cant timbers muſt be firſt determined, and alſo the cant of the foremoſt ones. The foremoſt cant-timber will extend ſo far forward as to be named &amp;; the cant on the middle line may be one foot four inches afore ſquare timber W, and on the main half breath line one foot nine inches afore timber Y ; in which ſituation the line may be drawn for the cant ; the aftermoſt may be timber The cant timbers may now be deſcribed in the ſame manner as thoſe in the after body, namely, by ſpacing them equally between the cant timber &amp; and the ſquare timber P, both on the main half breadth and middle lines, and drawing ſtraight lines between the correſponding points, obſerving to let them run out to the top-timber half-breadth line, where it comes without the main half breadth line.</p><p>The hawſe pieces muſt next be laid down in the half breadth plan ; the ſides of which muſt look fore and aft with the ſhip upon account of the round of the bow. Take the ſiding of the apron, which may be about four inches more than the ſtem, and ſet off half of it from the middle line, drawing a line from the main half breadth to the foremoſt cant timber, which will repreſent the foremoſt edge of the knight-head; then from that ſet off the ſiding of the knight-head, which may</p><p>be one foot four inches, and draw the aft side of it, The hawſe pieces may then be drawn, which are foul in number, by ſetting off their ſidings, namely, one foot six inches parallel from the knight-head and from each other ; and ſtraight lines being drawn from the main half-breadth line to the foremoſt cant timber will represont them.</p><p>The hawſe holes ſhould be deſcribed in ſuch a manner as to wound the hawſe pieces as little as poſſible ; they may therefore be placed ſo that the joint of the hawſe pieces ſhall be in the centre of the holes, whence they will only cut half the hawſe pieces. Take the dimenſions of the hawſe holes, which is one foot six inches, and ſet off the foremoſt one, or that next the middle line, on the joint between the firſt and ſecond hawſe piece ; then ſet off the other on the joint between the third and fourth hawſe piece ; and ſmall lines being drawn acroſs the main half breadth at their reſpective places will repreſent the hawſe holes in the half-breadth plan.</p><p>The hawſe holes ſhould next be repreſented in the ſheer plan. In this claſs of ſhips they are always placed in the middle between the cheeks ; therefore ſet off their diameter, namely, one foot six inches, between the cheeks, and draw lines parallel to the cheeks for their upper and lower part. Then to determine their ſituation agreeable to the half-breadth plan, which is the fore and aft way, draw perpendiculars from their interſections with the main half-breadth line to the lines drawn between the cheeks, and their true fixations, the fore and aft way, will be obtained ; and, by deſcribmg them round or circular, according to the points ſet off, they will be repreſented as they appear in the ſheer plan.</p><p>The apron may he drawn in the ſheer plan, ſetting off its bigneſs from the ſtem, and letting it come ſo low that the ſcarf may be about two feet higher than the foremoſt end of the fore foot ; by which it will give ſhip to the ſcarfs of the ſtem. It may run up to the head of the ſtem.</p><p>The cutting down ſhould next be drawn. Take therefore from the tables of dimenſions the different heights there expreſſed, and ſet them off from the upper edge of the keel on the correſponding timbers in the ſheer plan : then a curve deſcribed through the points ſet off, from the inner poſt aft to the apron forward, will be the cutting down. Next ſet off from the cutting down the thickneſs of the timber ſtrake, which is 8 ½ inches, and a curve deſcribed parallel to the former will repreſent the timber ſtrake, from which the depth of the  hold is always meaſured.</p><p>The kelson is drawn, by taking its depth from the dimenſions, and ſetting it off above the cutting down line; and a curve deſcribed parallel to the cutting down will repreſent the kelson.</p><p>The cutting down line being deſcribed, the knee of the dead wood abaft timber 27, being the after floor timber, may then be repreſented. Set off the ſiding of the floor abaft it, and erect a perpendicular in the ſheer plan, which will terminate the foremoſt end of the dead wood : then the fore and aft arm of the knee may be half the length of the whole dead wood, and the up and down arm may reach to the under part of the lower transom ; and the whole knee may be placed in such a manner that the upper piece of the dead</p></body></text></TEI>
