            <p>wood. There is but one village; and that is built on a rock, which runs up like a
                ſugar-loaf, and is 10 miles from the harbour of St George. The inhabitants are all
                Greeks, the cadi being the only Turk among them.</p>
            <p>SCIROCHO, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sirocho,</hi> a name generally given in Italy to
                every unfavourable wind. In the ſouth-weſt it is applied to the hot ſuffocating
                blaſts from Africa, and in the north-eaſt it means the cold bleak winds from the
                Alps.</p>
            <p>SCIRPUS, in botany: A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the triandria claſs
                of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 3d order, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Calamariae.</hi> The glumes are paleaceous, and imbricated all round. There is
                no corolla; and only one beardleſs ſeed.</p>
            <p>SCIRRHUS, in ſurgery and medicine, a hard tumor of any part of the body, void of
                pain, ariſing, as is ſuppoſed, from the inſpiſſation and induration of the fluids
                contained in a gland, though it may alſo appear in any other part of the body,
                eſpecially in the fat; being one of the ways in which an inflammation terminates.
                Theſe tumors are exceedingly apt to degenerate into cancers.</p>
            <p>SCITAMINEÆ. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Botany,</hi> p. 459.</p>
            <p>SCIURUS, the <hi rend="smallcaps">squirrel</hi>; a genus of quadrupeds belonging to
                the order of glires. It has two fore-teeth in each jaw, the ſuperior ones ſhaped
                like wedges, and the inferior ones compreſſed. There are 11 ſpecies; of which the
                moſt remarkable are,</p>
            <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">vulgaris,</hi> or common ſquirrel, with ears terminated with
                long tufts of hair; large, lively, black eyes; head, body, legs, and tail, of a
                bright reddiſh brown; breaſt and belly white; hair on each ſide the tail lies flat.
                In Sweden and Lapland, it changes in winter into grey. In Ruſſia it is ſometimes
                found black. In many parts of England there is a beautiful variety, with milk white
                tails. —This ſpecies inhabits Europe and North America, the northern and the
                temperate parts of Aſia: and a variety is even found as far ſouth as the iſle of
                Ceylon. It is a neat, lively, active animal; lives always in woods: in the ſpring,
                the female is ſeen purſued from tree to tree by the males, feigning an eſcape from
                their embraces; makes its neſt of moſs and dried leaves between the fork of two
                branches; brings three or four young at a time; has two holes to its neſt; ſtops up
                that on the ſide the wind blows, as Pliny juſtly remarks; lays in a hoard of winter
                proviſion, Rich as nuts, acorns, &amp;c.; in ſummer, feeds on buds and young ſhoots;
                is particularly fond of thoſe of fir, and the young cones; ſits up to eat, and uſes
                its forefeet as hands; covers itſelf with its tail; leaps to a ſurpriſing diſtance;
                when diſpoſed to croſs a river, a piece of bark is its boat, its tail the ſail; is
                in great plenty in Dunmallet, and there called <hi rend="italic">Conn.</hi> Boys
                frequently nurſe this beautiful and active animal under cats.</p>
            <p>There are three creatures, the ſquirrel, the field- mouſe, and the bird called the
                    <hi rend="italic">nuthatch,</hi> which live much on hazel nuts; and yet they
                open them each in a different way. The firſt, after raſping off the ſmall end,
                ſplits the ſhell in two with his long fore-teeth, as a man does with his knife; the
                ſecond nibbles a hole with his teeth, ſo regular as if drilled with a wimble, and
                yet ſo ſmall, that one would wonder how the kernel can be extracted through it;
                while the laſt pecks an irregular ragged hole with its bill; but as this artiſt has
                no paws to hold the nut firm while he pierces it, like an adroit workman, he fixes
                it, as it were in a vice, in ſome cleft of a tree, or in ſome crevice; when,
                ſtanding over it, he perforates the ſtubborn ſhell. While at work, they make a
                rapping noiſe, that may be heard at <hi rend="italic">a</hi> conſiderable diſtance.”
                    <hi rend="italic">White’s Seibοrne.</hi></p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">cinereus,</hi>@@ or grey
                    ſquirrel, with plain ears; hair of a dull grey colour, mixed with black, and
                    often tinged with dirty yellow; belly and inſides of the legs white; tail long,
                    buſhy, grey, and ſtriped with black: ſize of a half-grown rabbit. —Inhabits the
                    woods of Northern Aſia, North America, Peru, and Chili. They are very numerous
                    in North America, do incredible damage to the plantations of maize, run up the
                    ſtalks and eat the young ears. Deſcend in vaſt flocks from the mountains, and
                    join thoſe that inhabit the lower parts; are proſcribed by the provinces, and a
                    reward of three-pence per head given for every one that is killed. Such a number
                    was deſtroyed one year, that Pennſylvania alone paid in rewards L. 8000 of its
                    currency. Make their neſts in hollow trees, with moſs, ſtraw, wool, &amp;c. Feed
                    on maize in the ſeaſon, and on pine cones, acorns, and maſts of all kinds: form
                    holes under-ground, and there depoſit a large ſtock of winter proviſion. Deſcend
                    from the trees, and viſit their magazines when in want of meat; are particularly
                    buſy at the approach of bad weather; during the cold ſeaſon keep in their neſt
                    for ſeveral days together; ſeldom leap from tree to tree, only run up and down
                    the bodies; their hoards often deſtroyed by ſwine; when their magazines are
                    covered with deep ſnow, the ſquirrels often periſh for want of food; are not
                    eaſily ſhot, nimbly changing their place when they ſee the gun levelled; have
                    the actions of the common ſquirrel; are eaſily tamed; and their fleſh is
                    eſteemed very delicate. Their furs, which are imported under the name of <hi
                        rend="italic">petit-gris</hi>, are valuable, and uſed as linings to
                    cloaks.</p>
                <p> 3. The <hi rend="italic">niger,</hi> or black ſquirrel, with plain ears;
                    ſometimes wholly black, but often marked with white on the noſe, the neck, or
                    end of the tail; the tail ſhorter than that of the former; the body equal. It
                    inhabits the north of Aſia, North America, and Mexico; breeds and aſſociates in
                    ſeparate troops; is equally numerous with the former; commits as great ravages
                    among the maize; makes its neſt in the ſame manner, and forms, like them,
                    magazines for winter food. The fineſt are taken near the lake Baikal, and about
                    Barguzinſkoi-oſtrog, upon the Upper Angara, in the diſtrict of Nertſchinſk,
                    which are the beſt in all Siberia; theſe continue black the whole year, the
                    others grow ruſty in ſummer. — There is a variety with plain ears; coarſe fur
                    mixed with dirty white and black; throat and inſide of the legs and thighs
                    black; tail much ſhorter than thoſe of ſquirrels uſually are; of a dull yellow
                    colour, mixed with black; body of the ſize of the grey ſquirrel. It inhabits
                    Virginia; the planters call it the <hi rend="italic">cat ſquirrel.</hi></p>
                <p> 4. The <hi rend="italic">flavus,</hi> or fair ſquirrel, with the body and tail
                    of a flaxen colour; of a very ſmall ſize, with plain round ears, and rounded
                    tail. Inhabits the woods near Amadabad, the capital of Guzurat, in great
                    abundance, leap, ing from tree to tree. Linnaeus ſays it is an inhabitant of
                    South America.</p>
                <p> 5. The <hi rend="italic">ſtriatus,</hi> or ground ſquirrel, with plain
                    ears;</p>
