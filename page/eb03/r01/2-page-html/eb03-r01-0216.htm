<p><span class="font3">overturned the French monarchy. Almoſt all the men of property in the kingdom concurred with the miniſtry&nbsp;in thinking a war with France neceſſary for the pur-poſe of ſecuring the conſtitution at home. After the&nbsp;loth of Auguſt the Britiſh miniſter had been recalled ;&nbsp;but the new republic ſtill ſuffered the former ambaſſa-dor from France, M. Chauvelin, to remain in England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The oftenſible grounds </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font3">quarrel on the part of Great Britain were chiefly two ; the decree oſ the 15th&nbsp;of November 1792, by which </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font3">was truly obſerved that&nbsp;encouragement to rebellion was held out to tlie ſubjects&nbsp;of every ftate, and that war was thereby waged againſt&nbsp;every eſtabliſhed government. Of this decree the French&nbsp;executive council gave explanations, denying tlie fairneſs of the interpretation put upon it, and alleging,&nbsp;that the intention of the convention was only to give&nbsp;aid to fuch countries as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">had already</span><span class="font3"> acquired their freedom, and by a declaration of the general will requeſted&nbsp;aid for its preſervation. But this explanation cannot be&nbsp;admitted. The decree expreſsly ſays, that the French&nbsp;nation will </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">grant coffiftancedo all who wifh to procure liberty ;</span><span class="font3"> and when it is conſidered what their notions of liberty are, it cannot be doubted but that their intention&nbsp;was to excite rebellion in foreign nations. The ſecond&nbsp;point of diſpute referred to the opening of the Scheldt.&nbsp;This river runs from Brabant through the Dutch territory&nbsp;to the ſea. The Dutch had ſhut up the mouth of it, and&nbsp;prevented any maritime commerce from being carried on&nbsp;by the people of Brabant by means of the river. To render&nbsp;themfelves popular in Brabant, ;he French had declared, that they would open the navigation of the Scheldt.&nbsp;But Great Britain had ſome time before bound herſelf&nbsp;by treaty with the Dutch to affiſt them in obſtructing&nbsp;this nayigation, and now declared to the French, that&nbsp;the project of opening the Scheldt mnſt be renounced&nbsp;if peace with Great Britain was to remain. The&nbsp;French alleged, that by the law of nations navigable rivers ought to be' open to all who reſide on their banks ;&nbsp;but that the point was of no importance either to&nbsp;France or England, and even of very little importance&nbsp;to Holland ; that if the people of Brabant themſelves&nbsp;choſe to give it up, they would make no objection.&nbsp;It has been thought remarkable, that the Dutch gave&nbsp;themſelves no trouble about the matter. They did not&nbsp;aſk the aſſlſtance of England ; and with that coolneſs&nbsp;which is peculiar to their character, the merchants in-dividually declared, tliat if the Scheldt was opened, they&nbsp;could manage tlieir commerce as well at Antwerp as&nbsp;at Amſterdam. But in all this there is nothing&nbsp;ſtrange. Among tlic Dutch were many republicans,&nbsp;wlio wiſhed for the downfal of the ſtadtholder. Tlieſe&nbsp;rejoiced at every thing wliich diſtreſſed him, or had a&nbsp;tendency to render his office uſeleſs in the eyes of the&nbsp;people. Others, who thought diſſerently, were afraid&nbsp;to ſpeak their ſentiments,, as Dumourier was in their&nbsp;neighbourhood with a victorious army. The reſult of&nbsp;the whole was, that M. Chauvelin was commanded by&nbsp;the Brſtiſh government to leave this country. The&nbsp;French executive council gave powers to another mini-ſter, M. Maret, to negociate, and requeſted a paſſport&nbsp;for him ; but he was not ſuſſered to land. The haughty&nbsp;republicans having thus ſar humbled themſelves before&nbsp;the Britiſh government, at laſt, on the iſt of February 1793, on the motion of Briſſot, the national convention decreed, among other articles, that &quot; George&nbsp;king of England had never ceaſed ſince the revolution</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font3">of the 10th of Auguſt 1792 from giving </span><span class="font1">to the </span><span class="font3">French nation proofs of his attachment to the concert&nbsp;of crowned heads ; that he had drawn into the ſame&nbsp;lake the ſtadtholder of the United Provinces ; that,&nbsp;contrary to the treaty of 1783, the Engliſh miniſtry&nbsp;had granted protection to the emigrants and others who&nbsp;have openly appeared in arms againſt France; that they&nbsp;have committed an outrage againſt the French repnb-lic, by ordering the ambaſſador of France to quit Great&nbsp;Britain ; that the Engliſh have ſtopped divers boats&nbsp;and veſſels laden with corn for France, whilſt, at tlie&nbsp;ſame time, contrary to the tieaty of 1786, they con-tinue the exportation of it to other foreign countries ;&nbsp;that to thwart more efficaciouſiy the commercial tranſ-actions of the republic with England, they have by an&nbsp;act of parliament prohibited the cmculation of aſſignats.&nbsp;The convention therefore </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">declare,</span><span class="font3"> that in conſequence&nbsp;of tliefe acts of hoſtility and aggreffion, the French republic is at war with the king of England and tlie&nbsp;ſtadtholder of the United Provinces.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The abſurdity of pretending tliat any treaty with France made in 1783 could be violated hy protecting&nbsp;the emigrants who fled from the fury of tlie convention,&nbsp;muſt be obvious to every reader. The convention was&nbsp;itſelf a rebellious uſurpation of tlie government with&nbsp;which ſuch a treaty was made. The prohibition of&nbsp;affignats was certainly contrary to no law, and was ſanc-tioned by every motive oſ expediency, unleſs tlie convention could prove that all nations were bound by&nbsp;the law of nature to riſk their own credit upon tlie&nbsp;credit of the Frencll republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">About a fortnight after this abſurd declaration againſt Britain, war was likewiſe declared againſt Spain ; and&nbsp;in tlie courſe of tlie ſummer France was at war with&nbsp;all Europe, excepting only Swiſſerland, Sweden, Den*&nbsp;mark, and Turkey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the mean time General Dumourier, who was proceeding agreeably to his orders, made an attack upon Holland ; but in doing this he diſperſed his troops in&nbsp;ſucli a manner as to expoſe them much to any attack&nbsp;on the ſide of Germany. He commanded General Mi-randa to inveſt Maeſtricht, while he advanced to block&nbsp;up Breda and Bergen-op-zoom. The ſirſt of theſe places,&nbsp;viz. Breda,ſurrendered on the 24th of February; Klundert&nbsp;was taken on the 26th ; and Gertruydenberg on the&nbsp;4th of March. But here tlie triumphs of Dumourier&nbsp;ended. The ſieges of williamſtadt and Bergen-op-zoom were vigorouſty but unſucceſsſully preſſed. On&nbsp;tbe iſt of March General Clairfait having paſſed the&nbsp;Roer, attacked the French poſts, and compelled them&nbsp;to retreat with tlie loſs of 2000 men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The following day the archduke attacked them anew with conſiderable ſucceſs. On the 3d the French were&nbsp;driven from Aix-la-Chapelie, with the loſs of 4000 men&nbsp;killed and 1600 taken priſoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The ſiege of Maeſtricht was now raiſed, and the French retreated to Tongres, where they were alſo at-tacked and forced to retreat to St Tron. Dumourier&nbsp;here joined them, but did not bring his army along&nbsp;with him from the attack upon Holland. After ſome&nbsp;ſkirmiſhes a general engagement took place at Neer-winden. It was fought on the part of the French&nbsp;with great obſtinacy ; but they were at length over-?&nbsp;powered by the number of their enemies, and perhaps&nbsp;alfo by the treachery of their commander. This de-feat </span><span class="font1">was fatal. The French loſt 3000 </span><span class="font3">men, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">6oz&gt;o</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
