a market-town of the county of Worcester, which owes its origin to the recent formation of basins at the junction of the river Stour with the Severn. In these basins the barges that pass on the canals in the north of England meet the vessels which ascend the Severn from Bristol and Gloucester; and thus goods are transmitted from one part of the kingdom to the other with regularity and economy. The vicinity abounds in coal, much of which supplies the salt-makers at Droitwich, as well as the glass-makers in and around the place, and the iron-workers also, who abound in the neighbourhood. The town is well built, most of the houses being of recent erection. There is <hi rend="italic">a</hi> handsome chapel of ease, and a magnificent iron bridge over the Severn, with a single arch of 150 feet span. On Wednesdays and Saturdays it has markets, which are well supplied. It is 124 miles from London, and eleven from Worcester. As it is a part of the parish of Old Swenford, which lies in two counties, the population-tables do not sufficiently show what has been the population of this new town at the four decennial parliamentary enumerations. It is now estimated at 6800.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
