<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">collections. A great part of the lower group was unfinished at the time of the painter’s sudden death in 1520, and a good deal of the heavy colouring of Giulio Romano&nbsp;is visible in it. On the death of Raphael the picture became too precious to send out of Rome, and Cardinal de’&nbsp;Medici contented himself with sending the Resurrection of&nbsp;Lazarus to Narbonne. The Transfiguration was bequeathed&nbsp;by him to the monks of S. Pietro in Montorio, in tvhose&nbsp;church it remained till it was stolen by Napoleon I. It&nbsp;now hangs in the Vatican Gallery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Architectural Work</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">.@@<sup>1</sup>—Though he designed but few buildings, Raphael’s great repute even in this branch of art is shown by the&nbsp;fact that Bramante, before his death in March 1514, specially&nbsp;requested that Raphael should be made his successor as chief architect of St Peter’s. To this most important post he was appointed&nbsp;by a brief of Leo X., dated 1st August 1514. The progress of St&nbsp;Peter’s was, however, too slow for him to leave much mark on its&nbsp;design. Another work of Bramante’s, completed by Raphael, was&nbsp;the graceful Cortile di S. Damaso in the Vatican, including the&nbsp;loggie, which were decorated with stucco-reliefs and paintings of&nbsp;sacred subjects by his pupils under his own supervision, but only&nbsp;very partially from his designs.@@<sup>2</sup> The Palazzo dell’ Aquila, built&nbsp;for Giovanni Battista Branconio, and destroyed in the 17th century&nbsp;during the extension of St Peter’s, was one of Raphael’s chief works&nbsp;as an architect. He also designed the little cross church, domed&nbsp;at the intersection like a miniature St Peter’s, called S. Eligio&nbsp;degli Orefici, which still exists near the Tiber, almost opposite the&nbsp;Farnesina gardens, a work of but little merit. According to M.&nbsp;Geymiiller, whose valuable work, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rafaello come Architetto,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Milan,&nbsp;1883, has done so much to increase our knowledge of this subject,&nbsp;the Villa Farnesina of Agostino Chigi, usually attributed to Peruzzi,&nbsp;was, as well as its palace-like stables, designed by Raphael; but&nbsp;internal evidence makes this very difficult to believe. It has too&nbsp;much of the delicate and refined character of the 15th century for&nbsp;Raphael, whose taste seems to have been strongly inclined to the&nbsp;more developed classic style, of which Palladio afterwards became&nbsp;the chief exponent. The Palazzo Vidoni, near S. Andrea della&nbsp;Valle, also in Rome, is usually attributed to Raphael, but an&nbsp;original sketch for this in Peruzzi’s own hand has recently been&nbsp;identified among the collection of drawings at Siena ; this, however, is not a certain proof that the design was not Raphael’s. M.&nbsp;Geymiiller has, however, shown that the Villa Madama, on the&nbsp;slopes of Monte Mario above Rome, was really designed by him,&nbsp;though its actual carrying out, and the unrivalled stucco-reliefs&nbsp;which make its interior one of the most magnificent palaces in the&nbsp;world, are due to Giulio Romano and Giovanni da Udine, as mentioned in Vasari’s life of the latter.@@<sup>3</sup> The original design for this&nbsp;villa made by Raphael himself has been discovered by M. Gey-miiller. Another architectural work was the little Chigi chapel in&nbsp;S. Maria del Popolo, built in 1516, for the dome of which the&nbsp;above-mentioned mosaics were designed (see fig. 6). At the time&nbsp;of his death he was preparing to build himself a handsome palace&nbsp;near the church of S. Eligio ; the deed for the purchase of its site&nbsp;was signed by him only a few days before his last short illness.&nbsp;Though not completed till 1530, the Palazzo Pandolfini at Florence&nbsp;was also designed by him ; it is a dull scholastic building without&nbsp;any special beauty either in proportion or treatment of the mass ;&nbsp;it is illustrated by Montigny and Famin, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Architecture Toscane,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Paris, 1815, pis. 33-36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A sober criticism of Raphael’s architectural works must force one to refuse him a high position in this branch of art. In the clinrch&nbsp;of S. Eligio and the Chigi chapel he is merely a copyist of Bramante,&nbsp;and his more original works show but little power of invention or&nbsp;even mastery of the first principles of architectural design. His&nbsp;details are, howevei·, often delicate and refined (especially in the&nbsp;Palazzo Pandolfini), and he was supremely successful in the decorative treatment of richly ornamented interiors when he did not, as&nbsp;in some of the Vatican stanze, sacrifice the i־oom to the frescos on&nbsp;its walls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sculpture.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">—That Vasari is right in attributing to him the model for the beautiful statue of Jonah in the Chigi chapel (fig. 7) is&nbsp;borne witness to by two important documents, which show that&nbsp;his almost univei’sal talents led him to attempt with success the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">preliminary part of the sculptor’s art, though there is no evidence to show that he ever worked on marble.@@<sup>4</sup> One of these is a letter&nbsp;written to Michelangelo to warn him that Raphael had been invading his province as a sculptor by modelling a boy, which hail&nbsp;been executed in marble by a pupil, and was a work of much&nbsp;beauty. Again, after his death his friend Baldassare Castiglione,&nbsp;in a letter dated 8th May 1523, asks his steward in Rome “if&nbsp;Giulio Romano still possesses a certain boy in marble by Raphael&nbsp;and what his lowest price for it would be,”—“s’egli [Giulio Romano]&nbsp;ha più quel puttino di marmo di mano di Raffaello e per quanto si&nbsp;daria all’ ultimo.” A group in marble of a Dead Boy on his Dolphin&nbsp;Playfellow, now in&nbsp;the St Petersburg&nbsp;Hermitage, has been&nbsp;erroneously supposed&nbsp;to be Raphael’s “puttino,” which has also&nbsp;been identified with&nbsp;a statuette of a child&nbsp;till recently at Florence in the possession&nbsp;of Signor Molini.@@<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>The statue of Jonah&nbsp;was executed in&nbsp;marble by Loren-zetto, a Florentine&nbsp;sculptor ; and it remained in his studio&nbsp;for many years after&nbsp;Raphael’s death. The&nbsp;South Kensington&nbsp;Museum possesses a&nbsp;small clay sketch for&nbsp;this beautiful group,&nbsp;slightly different&nbsp;from the marble ; it&nbsp;is probably the original design by the&nbsp;master’s own hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The whole feeling of the group—a beautiful youth seated on&nbsp;a sea - monster — is&nbsp;purely classical, and&nbsp;the motive is prob-.&nbsp;ably taken from&nbsp;some antique statue&nbsp;representing Arion&nbsp;or Taras on a dolphin.@@<sup>6</sup> Being intended for a church it was necessary to give the&nbsp;figure a sacred name, and hence the very incongruous title that it&nbsp;received. There is no trace of Raphael’s hand in the design of the&nbsp;other statue, an Elijah by Lorenzetto, though it also is ascribed to&nbsp;him by Vasari.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lesser Arts practised by Raphael.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">—Like other great artists, Raphael did not disdain to practise the lesser branches of art : a&nbsp;design for a silver perfume-burner with female caryatids is preserved&nbsp;in an engraving by Marco da Ravenna ; and he also designed two&nbsp;handsome repoussé salvers for Agostino Chigi, drawings for which&nbsp;are now at Dresden. In designs for tarsia-work and wood-carving he was especially skilful ; witness the magnificent doors and&nbsp;shutters of the stanze executed by his pupil Giovanni Barile of&nbsp;Siena.@@<sup>7</sup> The majolica designs attributed to him were by a namesake and relation called Raffaello di Ciarla ;@@<sup>8</sup> and, though many&nbsp;fine dishes and ewers of Urbino and other majolica are decorated&nbsp;with Raphael’s designs, they are all taken from pictures or engravings, not specially done by him for ceramic purposes. With the&nbsp;frivolity of his age Leo X. occasionally wasted Raphael’s skill on&nbsp;unworthy objects, such as the scenery of a temporary'theatre ; and&nbsp;in 1516 the pope set him to paint in fresco the portrait life-size&nbsp;of a large elephant, the gift of the king of Portugal, after the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
