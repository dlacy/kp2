<p><span class="font0">empire, Oleg prepared to carry into effect his ambitious designs against Constantinople. Leaving Igor at Kief, he&nbsp;himself embarked on the Dnieper with eighty-thousand warriors, on board of not fewer than two thousand vessels. Their&nbsp;passage down the river met with no obstruction, till they&nbsp;came to that part where its course is embarrassed for nearly&nbsp;fifteen leagues by seven rocks ; and here began a series&nbsp;of perils, labours, and fatigues, which none but barbarians&nbsp;could have overcome. They were obliged to unload their&nbsp;barks, and convey them over the rocks ; and, in particular,&nbsp;at the fourth rock, they carried their baggage for above six&nbsp;thousand paces, exposed to the perpetual risk of attack from&nbsp;the neighbouring nations with whom they were at war, while&nbsp;thus hampered and encumbered. Having at length reached&nbsp;the mouth of the Dnieper, Oleg drew together his scattered&nbsp;vessels to be repaired, and waited for a favourable wind to&nbsp;carry him across the Black Sea to the mouth of the Dniester.&nbsp;Here the vessels were again refitted, and hence the expedition, coasting along the shores of the Euxine, soon arrived&nbsp;at the Strait of Constantinople.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The inhabitants of the imperial city, on discovering the approach of the barbarians, had drawn a massy chain across&nbsp;the harbour, thus hoping to prevent their landing. In this&nbsp;hope, however, they were deceived. The invaders drew&nbsp;ashore their barks, fitted wheels to their flat bottoms, and&nbsp;converted them into carriages, which by the help of sails&nbsp;they forced along the roads that led to the city, and thus&nbsp;arrived under the walls of Constantinople. In their route&nbsp;they ravaged the whole country, and pillaged and demolished&nbsp;the houses ; loaded the inhabitants with irons, and committed other enormities which generally attend the incursions&nbsp;of a barbarous enemy. The weak Leo, who then swayed&nbsp;the sceptre of the Grecian empire, instead of making a&nbsp;manly resistance, is said to have attempted carrying off his&nbsp;enemy by poison ; but this not succeeding, he was obliged&nbsp;to purchase from the conqueror an ignominious peace. Oleg&nbsp;on his return made his entrance into Kief laden with the&nbsp;wealth acquired by his victory; and the people, dazzled with&nbsp;such splendid objects, imagined their prince to be endowed&nbsp;with supernatural powers, and looked up to him with a reverence approaching to adoration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Soon after his return to his own dominions, the Russian monarch despatched deputies to Constantinople with the&nbsp;articles of a treaty, which he required the Greek emperor&nbsp;to sign. This treaty, which is preserved in the Chronicles&nbsp;of Nestor, is extremely curious ; and we learn from it many&nbsp;important particulars respecting the internal policy of the&nbsp;Russians at the beginning of the tenth century. Several&nbsp;articles of it show that the Russian laws laid great stress on&nbsp;oaths ; that they pronounced the sentence of death against&nbsp;the murderer, instead of inflicting on him only a pecuniary&nbsp;fine, and thus allowing the rich to commit assassination with&nbsp;impunity ; that the punishment of offences did not extend&nbsp;to the entire confiscation of goods, and hence the widow&nbsp;and orphan did not suffer for a crime of which they were&nbsp;innocent ; that robbery, which attacks only property, was&nbsp;punished by the privation of property ; that the citizens, secure in their possessions, were under no apprehension that&nbsp;the sovereign would seize on their heritage, and might even&nbsp;dispose of their effects in favour of friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Oleg maintained the sovereign power for thirty-three years; nor does it appear that Igor, even after he attained&nbsp;the age of majority, had any share in the administration, till&nbsp;the death of his guardian, in 913, left him in full possession&nbsp;of the throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Igor had reached his fortieth year before he entered upon the government. He soon discovered marks of the same&nbsp;warlike spirit which had actuated his predeccssor. Among&nbsp;the nations that had been subjugated by Oleg, several, on&nbsp;the accession of the new sovereign, attempted to regain their&nbsp;independence ; the Drevlians, who dwelt on the banks of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the Uscha, in the present district of Vrutsch, being the first to revolt. They were, however, soon quelled, and punished '&nbsp;by the imposition of an increased tribute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Igor had next to contend with more formidable enemies. The Petchenegans, a nation hitherto unknown, quitted their&nbsp;settlements on the Yaik and the Volga, and made incursions into the Russian territory. These people appear to&nbsp;have been at least as powerful and warlike as the Varages;&nbsp;and Igor, finding himself unable to cope with them, concluded a treaty of alliance. About five years afterwards,&nbsp;disputes arose between the new allies, and both had recourse&nbsp;to arms. It appears that the Russians were finally victorious, and the Petchenegans were for some time disabled&nbsp;from giving further molestation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Russian monarch, in imitation of his guardian, soon turned his attention towards the Grecian empire, where depredations might apparently be made with impunity. He&nbsp;equipped an immense armament, consisting, if we may credit&nbsp;the improbable tale of the Russian annals, of ten thousand&nbsp;barks, each carrying forty men, thus forming an array of four&nbsp;hundred thousand warriors. He set sail for Constantinople,&nbsp;without any previous declaration of war, and without any&nbsp;ostensible motive for thus infringing the treaty which had&nbsp;been concluded some years before between Oleg and Leo.&nbsp;In his route he overran and ravaged the provinces of Paphlagonia, Pontus, and Bithynia, plundering the towns, and&nbsp;butchering the inhabitants. For some time the barbarians&nbsp;met with no opposition, as the imperial troops were engaged&nbsp;in distant provinces ; but the government of the empire was&nbsp;now in very different hands from those w’hich had held it during the former invasion. The Grecian forces were well appointed, and commanded by two generals of approved ability&nbsp;and courage. These were Theophanes and Phocas, of whom&nbsp;the former commanded the fleet, and the latter the army.&nbsp;The Russians had soon cause to repent their temerity. Theophanes attacked them on board their ships, within sight of&nbsp;the Pharos, and throwing among them the unquenchable&nbsp;Grecian fire, with the effects of which they were wholly&nbsp;unacquainted, produced such confusion, that many plunged&nbsp;into the sea in order to avoid the flames that threatened&nbsp;and pursued them. Their vessels were dispersed, shattered, or burned, and great numbers of their crews perished.&nbsp;The remainder reached the shores of Bithynia; but before they could recover from their consternation, they were&nbsp;met by Phocas, who fell upon them with his troops, and&nbsp;made prodigious slaughter. So great were the losses sustained by Igor in this unfortunate expedition, that he carried back with him scarcely a third of his army. This second naval expedition of the Russians against Constantinople took place in 941.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Though discouraged by the ill success which had attended his first invasion of the Grecian empire, Igor was too much stimulated by the desire of plunder, not to risk a&nbsp;second attempt. Three years afterwards, he collected new&nbsp;forces, took into pay many of the Petchenegans, and again set&nbsp;out for Greece ; but before he had advanced beyond the Tau-rican Chersonesus, the emperor Romanus, informed of his&nbsp;approach, anil not choosing to hazard the result of an engagement, sent deputies to the Russian leader, offering to&nbsp;pay him the same tribute which had been given to his predecessor. With this offer Igor complied, and once more&nbsp;retired with his army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Igor was now far advanced in years ; but the insatiable rapacity of his officers, ever craving for fresh spoils from vanquished nations, impelled him to turn his arms against the&nbsp;Drevlians, for the purpose of obtaining from them an increase of their yearly tribute. In this unjust attack he was&nbsp;at first successful, and returned loaded with the contributions which he had levied from that people ; but having&nbsp;dismissed great part of his troops with the spoils of the vanquished, and marching with the remainder too far into the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
