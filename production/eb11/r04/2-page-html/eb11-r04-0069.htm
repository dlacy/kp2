<p><span class="font3">The use of mortar with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">opus quadratum</span><span class="font3"> is a sign of a comparatively I early date. It.occurs, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font3"> in the “ Servian ” wall on the Aventine</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and in the Tabularium. Under the Empire massive blocks, whether of tufa, travertine or marble, are set without any&nbsp;mortar. It must, however, be observed that in these early instances&nbsp;the “ mortar ” is but a thin stratum of lime, little thicker than stout&nbsp;paper, used not as a cement to bind the blocks together, but simply&nbsp;to give the joints a smoothly fitting surface. The actual&nbsp;binding together was done by clamps and dowels, as well&nbsp;as by the mass and weight of the great blocks used. Except in the&nbsp;earliest masonry, each block was very carefully fastened, not only&nbsp;to the next blocks on the same course, which was done with double&nbsp;dove-tai led dowels of wood, but also to those above and below with&nbsp;stout iron clamps, run with lead (Vitr. ii. 8).<sup>@@1</sup> In more ornamental&nbsp;marble, work bronze clamps were often used. Concrete is rarely&nbsp;found in connexion with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">opus quadratum;</span><span class="font3"> part of the * * Servian ”&nbsp;wall on the Aventine received a backing of concrete at a relatively&nbsp;late period Up to the ist century </span><span class="font2">B.c. </span><span class="font3">it was faced with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">opus&nbsp;incertum-^-sma\\</span><span class="font3"> irregularly shaped blocks of tufa, 3 to 6 in.&nbsp;across, with pointed ends driven into the concrete while it was soft,&nbsp;and worked smooth on the face only (see fig. 2). From the beginning&nbsp;of the ist century </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">opus reticulatum<sup>@@2</sup> </span><span class="font3">formed of&nbsp;rectangular tufa prisms laid in a regular pattern like a&nbsp;net (whence the name), is found. It is very neat in&nbsp;appearance, and is often fitted with great care,though it was&nbsp;generally covered with stucco. The so-called “ house of Livia ”&nbsp;on the Palatine is a good example*of the earlier sort, when the quoins&nbsp;were made of small rectangular blocks&nbsp;of tufa. Under the Empire brick&nbsp;quoins came into use (as may be&nbsp;seen, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font3"> in the so-called palace of&nbsp;Caligula). Though in Rome </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">opus&nbsp;reticulatum</span><span class="font3"> was almost always made&nbsp;of tufa, in the neighbourhood of the&nbsp;city it was sometimes of peperino or&nbsp;even lava, where these materials w<sup>r</sup>ere</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">found on the spot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of concrete walls faced w’ith burnt bricks no dated example earlier than the middle of the 1st century </span><span class="font2">B.c. </span><span class="font3">is known. The facing&nbsp;consisted at first of triangular fragments, of tiles </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(tegulae),&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">broken for the purpose and more or less irregular in shape&nbsp;and size, but from the latter part of the ist century </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">onwards triangular bricks were specially manufactured for w<sup>r</sup>all-facings. This shape was adopted in order to present a large surface&nbsp;on the face with little expenditure of brick, and also to improve the&nbsp;bond wrth the concrete behind (see fig. 4). Even party w'alls of small&nbsp;rooms are not built solid, but have a concrete core faced with brick&nbsp;triangles about 3 in. long. In order to support the facing until the&nbsp;concrete was set, the Roman builders used a wooden framing covered&nbsp;with planks on the inside. Sometimes the planks were nailed outside&nbsp;the wooden uprights, as was done with unfaced concrete w'alls, and&nbsp;then a series of grooves appear in the face of the brickwork. Walls&nbsp;faced with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">opus reticulatum</span><span class="font3"> must have been supported temporarily</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">in the same way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The character of the brick facing *is a great help towards determining the date of Roman buildings. In early work the bricks are thick and the joints thin, while in later times the reverse is the case,&nbsp;so that brickwork of the time of Severus and later has more bricks&nbsp;to the foot than that of the Flavian period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The length of the bricks as it appears on the face is no guide to the date, since one or more of the sharp points of the brick triangles&nbsp;w<sup>r</sup>ere frequently broken off before they were used. Moreover,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font3">varieties both in quality of workmanship and size of the bricks often occur in w<sup>r</sup>ork of the same date. In the remains of Nero’s Golden&nbsp;House great varieties appear, and some of the walls in the inferior&nbsp;rooms are faced with very irregular and careless brickwork.<sup>@@3</sup> Special&nbsp;care and neatness were employed in the rare cases when the wall was&nbsp;not to be covered with stucco, which in the absence of marble was&nbsp;usually spread over both inside and outside walls. All these circumstances make great caution necessary in judging of dates; fortunately&nbsp;after the ist century </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.,</span><span class="font3"> and in some cases even earlier, stamps&nbsp;impressed on bricks, and especially on the large tiles used for arches,&nbsp;give clearer indications. The reason of the almost universal use&nbsp;of smooth facings either of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">opus reticulatum</span><span class="font3"> or of brick over concrete&nbsp;walls is a very puzzling question; for concrete itself forms an&nbsp;excellent ground for the stucco coating or backing to the marble slabs,&nbsp;while the stucco adheres with difficulty to a smooth facing, and is&nbsp;very liable to fall away. The modem practice of raking out the&nbsp;joints to form a key was not employed by the Romans, but before&nbsp;the mortar. w<sup>r</sup>as hard they studded the face of the wall with marble&nbsp;plugs and iron or bronze nails driven into the joints, so as to give&nbsp;a hold for the stucco—a great waste both of labour and material.<sup>@@4</sup>&nbsp;The quality of the mortar varies according to its date: during the&nbsp;ist and 2nd centuries it is of remarkable hardness—made of lime&nbsp;with a mixture of coarse pozzolana of a bright red colour; in the&nbsp;3rd century*t began to be inferior in quality; and the pozzolana used&nbsp;under the later Empire is brown instead of red.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Concrete was at first always made of lumps of tufa; then travertine, lava, broken bricks and even marble were used, in fact all the chips and fragments of the mason’s yard. Under&nbsp;the Empire the concrete used was made wnth travertine&nbsp;or lava for foundations, with tufa or broken bricks for&nbsp;walls, and with tufa or pumice-stone (for the sake of&nbsp;lightness) for vaults. Massive walls were cast in a mould; upright&nbsp;timbers, about 6 by 7 in. thick and 10 to 14 ft. long, were set in&nbsp;rows on each face of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">future wall; planks 9 to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">10 in. wide were nailed</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">to them, so as to form a</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">case, into which the semi</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">fluid mass of stones,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">lime and pozzolana was</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">poured. When this was</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">set the timbers were re</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">moved and refixed on the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">top of the concrete wall;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">then fresh concrete was</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">poured in; and this pro</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">cess was repeated till the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">wall was raised to the re</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">quired height. Usually</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">such cast-work was only</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">used for foundations and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">cella walls, the upper</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">parts being faced W’ith</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">brick; but in some cases</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the whole wall to the top</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">was cast in this way and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the brick facing omitted.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">for each wall was one</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">perfectly coherent mass,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and could only be de</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">stroyed by a laborious</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">process like that of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">quarrying hard stone from its native bed. Owing to this method of building the progress of the work from day to day can often be&nbsp;traced by a change in the look of the concrete. About 3 ft. appears&nbsp;to have been the average amount of wall raised in a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Marble linings were fixed very firmly to the waifs with long clamps of metal, hooked at the end so as to hold in a hole made in&nbsp;the marble slab. Fig. 4 gives an example, of the time of&nbsp;Augustus, fixed against a stone wall. The blocks were&nbsp;usually marked in the quarry with a number, and often&nbsp;with the names of the reigning emperor and the overseer&nbsp;of the quarry. These quarry-marks are often of great value as&nbsp;indications of the date of a building or statue.<sup>@@5</sup> Metropolitan</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>@@@1 </sup>The expansion of the iron through rust, which caused the stone to split, has frequently been a great source of injury to Roman walls, as&nbsp;well as the practice, common in the middle ages, of breaking into the&nbsp;stones in order to extract the metal.</span></p>
