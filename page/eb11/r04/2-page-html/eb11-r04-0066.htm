It has a brilliant green ground covered&nbsp;with rectangular light green crystals of felspar. This is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lapis&nbsp;Lacedaemontus</span><span class="font1"> (wrongly called by the modern Romans “serpent-ino *’), so named from its quarries in Mount Ta^getus in Lace-daemonia (Paus. iii. 21, 4; Plin. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ILN.</span><span class="font1"> xxxvi. 55; Juv. xi. 175).&nbsp;It appears to have been mostly used for pavements and panels of&nbsp;wall linings. The granites used in.Rome came mostly from near&nbsp;Philae on the Nile (Plin. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">H.N.</span><span class="font1"> xxxvi. 63). The red sort was called&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lapis pyrrhopoecilus</span><span class="font1"> and the grey </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lapis psaronius.</span><span class="font1"> The columns in&nbsp;the Basilica Ulpia are a fine example of the latter; both sorts are&nbsp;used for the columns of the Pantheon and those of the temple of&nbsp;Saturn in the Forum. Gigantic ships were specially made to carry&nbsp;the obelisks and other great monoliths (Plin. //.A. xxxvi. 2, 67).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The style of architecture employed in ancient Rome (see Architecture, section </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roman,</span><span class="font1"> and Roman Art) may be&nbsp;said to have passed through three stages—the&nbsp;Etruscan, the Greek and the Roman. During the&nbsp;first few centuries of the existence of the city, both&nbsp;the methods of construction and the designs employed appear&nbsp;to have been purely Etruscan. The earliest temples were&nbsp;either simple cellae without columns, or else, in the case of&nbsp;the grander temples, such as that of Capitoline Jupiter, the&nbsp;columns were very widely spaced (araeostyle), and consequently&nbsp;had entablatures of wooden beams. The architectural decorations were more generally in gilt bronze or painted terra-cotta&nbsp;than in stone, and the paintings or statues which decorated&nbsp;the buildings were usually the work of Etruscan artists.<sup>@@1 </sup>The&nbsp;Greek influence is more obvious; it is found in the period&nbsp;following the Second Punic or Hannibalic War, and almost all&nbsp;the temples of the earlier imperial age are Greek, with certain&nbsp;modifications, not only in general design but in details and&nbsp;ornaments. Greek architects were largely employed, such as&nbsp;ApoIIodorus of Damascus, who designed Trajan’s forum and&nbsp;other buildings; on the other hand, a Roman, Cossutius, was&nbsp;employed on the building of the Olympieum at Athens, in the&nbsp;2nd century B.c. Roman architects such as Vitruvius and&nbsp;C. Mucius in the 1st century B.c., Severus and Ccler under&nbsp;Nero, and Rabirius under Domitian, were Greek by education,&nbsp;and probably studied at Athens (see Vitr. vii. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Praef.\</span><span class="font1"> Hirt,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gesch.</span><span class="font1"> d. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Baukunst,</span><span class="font1"> ii. p. 257).<sup>@@2</sup>The Romans, however, though&nbsp;far below the Greeks in artistic originality, were very able&nbsp;engineers, and this led to the development of a new and more&nbsp;purely Roman style, in which the restrictions imposed by the&nbsp;use of the stone lintel were put aside and large spaces were&nbsp;covered with vaults and domes cast in semi-fluid concrete, a&nbsp;method which had the enormous advantage of giving the arched&nbsp;form without the constant thrust at the springing which makes&nbsp;true arches or vaults of wide span so difficult to deal with. The&nbsp;enormous vaults of the great thermae, the basilica of Constantine, and the like, cover their spaces with one solid mass&nbsp;like a metal lid, giving the form but not the principle of the arch,&nbsp;and thus allowing the vault to be set on walls which would at&nbsp;once have been thrust apart had they been subjected to the&nbsp;immense leverage which a true arched vault constantly exerts&nbsp;on its imposts.<sup>@@3</sup>This is a very important point, and one which&nbsp;is usually overlooked, mainly owing to the Roman practice of&nbsp;facing their concrete with bricks, which (from an examination</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1 </sup>Pliny </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(H.N.</span><span class="font1"> xxxv. 154), quoting Varro, says that the decorations in painting and sculpture of the temple of Ceres near the Circus&nbsp;Maximus were the work of the first Greek artists employed in Rome,&nbsp;and that before that (c. 493 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.)</span><span class="font1"> “all things in temples were&nbsp;Etruscan.” Vitruvius (iii. 3) says, “ Ornantque signis fictilibus&nbsp;aut aereig inauratis eorum fastigia Tuscanico more, uti est ad&nbsp;Circum Maximum Cereris, et Herculis Pompeiani, item Capitolii ”&nbsp;(cf. iv. 7, vi. 3).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@2 </sup>The frequent use of engaged columns is a peculiarity of Roman architecture, but it is not without precedent in Greek buildings of the&nbsp;best period, e.g. in the temple of Zeus at Agrigentum. Surface&nbsp;enrichments over the mouldings were used far more largely by the&nbsp;Romans than by the Greeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@3</sup> In the beautiful drawings of C.hoisy </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(L'Art de bâtir chez les Romains,</span><span class="font1"> Paris, 1873) the structural importance of the brick used in&nbsp;vaults and arches is very much exaggerated.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">of the surface only) appear to be a principal item in the construction. The walls of the Pantheon, for example, are covered with tiers of brick arches, and many theories have been invented&nbsp;as to their use in distributing the weight of the walls. But a&nbsp;recognition of the fact that these walls are of concrete about&nbsp;20 ft. thick, while the brick facing averages scarcely 6 in. in&nbsp;thickness, clearly shows that these “ relieving arches ” have&nbsp;no more constructional use as far as concerns the pressure&nbsp;than if they were painted on the surface of the walls. The&nbsp;same applies to the superficial use of brick in all arches and&nbsp;vaults. Although, however, the setting of the concrete rendered&nbsp;the brick facing superfluous, it played its part in sustaining the&nbsp;fluid mass on its centring during the process of solidification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At first tufa only was used in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">opus quadratum,</span><span class="font1"> as we see in the so-called wall of Romulus. Next the harder peperino began to be&nbsp;worked, it is used, though sparingly, in the “Servian ”&nbsp;wall, and during the later Republic appears to have been&nbsp;largely employed for exterior walls or points where there&nbsp;was heavy pressure, while other parts were built of tuia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thirdly, travertine appears to have been introduced about the 2nd century n.c.. but was used at first for mereiy ornamental purposes,&nbsp;very much as marble was under the Empire; after about the middle&nbsp;of the 1st century </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> travertine began to be largely used for the&nbsp;solid mass of walls, as in the temple of Vespasian and the Colosseum.&nbsp;The tufa or peperino blocks were roughly 2 (Roman) ft. thick in&nbsp;regular courses (the “ isodomum ” of Vitruvius) by 2 ft. across the&nbsp;end, and under the Republic often exactly 4 ft. long, so that two&nbsp;blocks set endways</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ranged with one set</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">lengthways. They</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">It is interesting to note the manner&nbsp;in which the Roman&nbsp;builders mixed their&nbsp;different materials&nbsp;according to the&nbsp;weight they had to&nbsp;carry. While tufa&nbsp;was frequently used&nbsp;for the main walls,&nbsp;peperino (e.g. in the&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Servian ” wall on&nbsp;the Aventine) or<sub>x&nbsp;</sub>travertine (e.g. in^&nbsp;the forum of Augustus and the&nbsp;temple of Fortuna</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Virilis, so called) was inserted at points of special pressure, such as piers or arches (see fig.). The Colosseum is a particularly&nbsp;elaborate example of this mixed construction with three degrees&nbsp;of pressure supported by three different materials.</span></p>
