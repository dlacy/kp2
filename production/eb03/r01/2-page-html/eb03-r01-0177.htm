<p><span class="font3">found to be about I.,. 14,477,-000, How theſe immenſe ſums are appropriated, is next to be conſidered. And this&nbsp;is, firſt and principally, to the payment of the intereſt of&nbsp;the national debt. See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">NÀtionai Debt</span><span class="font3"> and Funds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The reſpective produces of the ſeveral taxes were originally ſeparate and diſtinct funds ; being ſecurities&nbsp;for the ſums advanced on each ſeveral tax, and for&nbsp;them only. But at laſt it became neceſſary, in order&nbsp;to avoid confuſion, as they multiplied yearly, to reduce&nbsp;the number of theſe ſeparate funds, by uniting and&nbsp;blending them together ; fuperadding the faith of parliament for the general ſecurity of the whole. So that&nbsp;there are now only three capital funds of any account,&nbsp;the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">aggregate</span><span class="font3"> fund, and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">general</span><span class="font3"> fund, ſo called from&nbsp;ſuch union and. addition ; and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">South-Sea</span><span class="font3"> fund, being the produce of the taxes appropriated to pay the&nbsp;intereſt of ſuch part of the national debt as was advanced by that company and its annuitants, whereby the&nbsp;ſeparate funds, which were thus united, are become&nbsp;mutual ſecurities for each other; and the whole produce&nbsp;of them, thus aggregated, liable to pay ſuch intereſt or&nbsp;annuities as were formerly charged upon each diſtinct&nbsp;fund : the faith of the legiſlature being moreover engaged to ſupply any caſual deficiencies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The cuſtoms, exciſes, and other taxes, which are to ſupport theſe funds, depending on contingencies, upon&nbsp;exports, imports, and conſumptions, muſt neceſſarily&nbsp;be of a very uncertain amount ; but they have always&nbsp;been conſiderably more than was ſufficient to anſwer the&nbsp;charge upon them. The ſurpluſſes, therefore, of the&nbsp;three great national funds, the aggregate, general, and&nbsp;Boutlι-Sea funds, over and above the intereſt and annuities charged upon them, are directed by ſtatute&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">3 </span><span class="font3">Geo. I. c. 7- to be carried together, and to attend&nbsp;the difpoſition of parliament ; and are uſually denominated </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ùscfinking fund,</span><span class="font3"> becauſe originally deſtined to fink&nbsp;and lower the national debt. To this have been ſince&nbsp;added many other entire duties, granted in fubſequent&nbsp;years ; and the annual intereſt of the ſums borrowed&nbsp;on their refpective credits is charged on, and payable&nbsp;out of, the produce of the ſinking fund. However,&nbsp;the nett ſurpluſſes and ſavings, after all deductions&nbsp;paid, amount annually to a very conſiderable fum. For&nbsp;as the intereſt on the national debt has been at ſeveral&nbsp;times reduced (by the conſent of the proprietors, who&nbsp;had their option either to lower their intereſt or be&nbsp;paid their principal), the ſavings from the appropriated&nbsp;revenues muſt needs be extremely large.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But, before any part of the aggregate fund (the ſurpluſſes whereof are one of the chief ingredients that&nbsp;form the ſinking fund) can be applied to diminiſh the&nbsp;principal of the public debt, it ſtands mortgaged by&nbsp;parliament to raiſe an annual ſum for the maintenance&nbsp;'of the king’s houſchold and the civil liſt. For this&nbsp;purpoſe, in the late reigns, the produce of certain&nbsp;branches of the exciſe and cuſtoms, the poſt-office, the&nbsp;duty on wine-licences, the revenues of the remaining&nbsp;crown-lands, the profits ariſing from courts of juſtice,&nbsp;(which articles include all the hereditary revenues of&nbsp;the crown), and alſo a clear annuity of L. 120,000 in&nbsp;money, were fettled on the king for life, for the ſupport of his majeſty’s houſehold, and the honour and&nbsp;dignity of the crown. And, as the amount of theſe&nbsp;ſeveral branches was uncertain, (though in the laſt reign&nbsp;they were computed to have⅛bmetimes raiſed almoſt a&nbsp;million), if they did </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font3">ariſe annually to L. </span><span class="font1">800,000,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">the parliament engaged to make up the deficiency. But&nbsp;his preſent majeſty having, fυoα after his acceffion, ſpon-taneouſly ſignified his conſent that his own hereditary&nbsp;revenues might be ſo diſpoſed of as might beſt conduce&nbsp;to the utility and fatisfaction of the public, and having&nbsp;graciouſly accepted a limited fum, the ſaid hereditary&nbsp;and other revenues are now carried into, and made a&nbsp;part of, the aggregate fund ; and the aggregate fund&nbsp;is charged with the payment of the whole annuity to&nbsp;the crown. The limited annuity accepted by his pre-ſent majeſty was at firſt L. 800,000, but it has been&nbsp;ſince augmented to L. 900,000. The expences them-felves, being put under the ſame care and management&nbsp;as the other branches of the public patrimony, produce&nbsp;more, and are better collected than heretofore ; and the&nbsp;public is a gainer of upwards of L. 100,000 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">per annum&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">by this diſintereſted bounty of his majeſty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I he finking fund, though long talked of as the laſt reſource of the nation, proved very inadequate to the&nbsp;purpoſe for which it was eſtabliſhed. Miniſters found&nbsp;pretences for diverting it into other channels ; and the&nbsp;diminution of the national debt proceeded ſlowly during&nbsp;the intervals of peace, whilſt each ſucceeding war increaſed it with great rapidity. To remedy this evil,&nbsp;and reſtore the public credit, to which the late war had&nbsp;given a conſiderable ſhock, Mr Pitt conceived a plan for&nbsp;diminiſhing the debt by a fund, which ſhould be rendered&nbsp;unalienable to any other purpoſe. In the feffion 1786,&nbsp;he moved that the annual ſurplus of the revenue above&nbsp;the expenditure ſhould be raiſed, by additional taxes,&nbsp;ſrom L. 900,000 to one million Sterling, and that cer*&nbsp;tain commiſſioners ſhould be veiled with the full power&nbsp;of difpoſing of this fum in the purchaſe of ſtock (ſee&nbsp;Funds), for the public, in their own names. Theſe&nbsp;commiſſioners ſhould receive the annual million by quarterly payments of L. 250,000, to be iſſued out of the&nbsp;exchequer before any other money, except the intereſt&nbsp;of the national debt itſelf ; by theſe proviſions, the&nbsp;fund would be ſecured, and no deficiencies in the na-tional revenues could affect it, but ſuch muſt be fepa~&nbsp;rately provided for by parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The accumulated compound intereſt on a million yearly, together with the annuities that would fall into&nbsp;that fund, would, he ſaid, in 28 years amount to ſuch&nbsp;a ſum as would leave a furplus of four millions annually,&nbsp;to be applied, if neceſſary, to the exigencies of the&nbsp;ſtate. In appointing the commiſſioners, he ſhould, he&nbsp;faid, endeavour to choofe perſons of ſuch weight and '&nbsp;character as correſponded with the importance of the&nbsp;commiſſion they were to execute. The fpeaker of the&nbsp;houfe of commons, the chancellor of the exchequer,&nbsp;the maſter of the rolls, the governor and deputy governor of the bank of England, and the accountant-general of the high court of chancery, were perſons who,&nbsp;from their feveral ſituations, he ſhould think highly&nbsp;proper to be of the number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To the principle of this bill no objection was madej though ſeveral ſpecious but ill-founded ones were urged&nbsp;againſt the ſufficiency of the mode which the chancellor&nbsp;of the exchequer had adopted for the accompliſhment.&nbsp;of fo great and ſo deſirable an end. He had made it&nbsp;a clauſe in his bill, that the accumulating million ſhould&nbsp;never be applied but to the purchaſe of ſtock. To this&nbsp;clauſe Mr Fox objected, and moved that the commit-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
