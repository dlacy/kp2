The toucan, however, ſceops out its neſt into the hollow of ſome tree, leaving only a hole large enough to go in and out at. There it ſits, with its great beak, guarding the entrance ; and if the monkey ventures to offer a viſit of curioſity, the toucan gives him ſueh a wel-come, that he preſently thinks proper to pack off, and is glad to eſcape with ſafety.</p><p>This bird is only found in the warm climates of South America, where it is in great requeft, both for the de-licacy of its fleſh, which is tender and nouriſhing, and for the beauty of its plumage, particularly the fea-thers of the breaſt. The ſkin of this part the Indians pluck off, and when dry glue to their cheeks ; and this they conſider as an irreſiſtible addition to their beauty.</p><p>RHAPIS, in botany : A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the hexandria clafs of plants ; and in the natural method ranking under the ſirſt order, <hi rend="italic">Palma.</hi>  The calyx is a monophylious triſid ſpatha ; the corolla monopetalous and triſid. There are two ſpecies, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>  i. Flabilliformis, or ground-ratan, a native cf China; 2. Arundinacea, ſimple leaved rhapis, a na-tive of Carolina.</p><p>RHAPSODI, Rhapsodjsts, in antiquity, perſons wlio made a buſineſs of ſinging pieces of Homer’s poems. Cuper informs us, that the Rhapfodi were clothed in red when they ſung the Iliad, and in blue when they ſung tlie Odyffey.. They performed on the theatres, and ſometimes ſtrove for prizes in. conteſts of poetry, ſinging, &amp;c. After the two antagoniſts liad ſiniſhed their parts, the two pieces or papers they were written in were joined together again : whence the name, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>  from    <hi rend="italic">ofuo,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">canticum :</hi>  but there</p><p>ſeem to have been other Rhapſodi of more antiquity than .theſe people, who compoſed heroic poems or ſongs in praiſe oſ heroes and great men, and ſung their own compoſitions ſrom town to town ſor a livelihood ; oſ which profeffion Homer himſelſ is ſaid to have been. See Bard.</p><p>RHAPSODOMANCY, an ancient kind oſ divina-tion performed by pitching on a paffage oſ a poet at hazard, and reckoning on it as a prediction oſ what was. to come to paſs. There were various ways oſ practi-fing this rhapſodomaney. Sometimes they wrote ſeveral papers or Sentences oſ a poet on ſo many pieces oſ wood, paper, or the like, ſhcok them together in an urn, and drew out one which was accounted the lot ſometimes they caſt dice on a table whereon verſes were written, and that whereon the die lodged contained the prediction- A third manner was by opening a book, and pitching on ſome verſe at ſirſt ſight. This me-thûd they particularly called the <hi rend="italic">fortes Praneflime ;</hi>  aud afterwards, according to the poet, made uſe oſ, <hi rend="italic">fortes Homeric#, fortes Vtrgdiana,</hi>  &amp;c. See Sortes.</p><p>RHAPSODY, in antiquity, a diſcourſe in verſe fang or rehearſed by a rhapſodiſt. Others will have rhapſody to ſignify a collection of yerſes, eſpecially</p><lb/><p>thoſe of Homer, which having been a long time diſ-perſed in pieces and fragments, were at length by Pi-ſiſtratus’s order digeſted into books called <hi rend="italic">rhapfodtes, </hi>ſrom    <hi rend="italic">fuo,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">canticum.</hi>  Hence, among mo-</p><p>derns, <hi rend="italic">rhapſody</hi>  is alſo uſed ſor an affemblage oſ paſſa-ges, thoughts, and authorities, raked together ſrom divers authors, to compoſe ſome new piece.</p><p>RHE, or Ree, a little iſſand in the Bay oſ Biſcay, near the coaſt oſ Aunis in France. It was taken du-ring the war with France which ended in 1763, in the expedition commanded by Hawke and Mordaunt.</p><p>RHEA AMERlCANA. The American oſtrſch of authors has been frequently mentioned, but till oſ late years very imperfectly known ; being blended by ſome with other genera, although forming oſ itſelſ a diſtinct one, differing in many things from all others. The older writers, however, have kept it ſeparate. It does not occur to us whether any author has figured this bird except <hi rend="italic">Nieremberg,</hi>  whoſe repreſentation conveys no juſt idea, which is wonderful, as it is to be met with iu ſufficient plenty in various parts oſ South America ; nor has the bird itſelſ made its appearance in the cabi-nets oſ coliectors, until the one now in the Leverian muſeum.</p><p>M. Bajon, in his <hi rend="italic">Mem. fur Cayenne,</hi>  gives a ſigure and deſcription oſ the jabirus, and ſeems clear that this bird is no other than the oſtrich oſ Amenca. From this affertion, Mr Latham, in his <hi rend="italic">Synopßs,</hi>  leaves the matter undecided ; but this author, in his <hi rend="italic">Index Qmi-thol.</hi>  ſrom having met with the ſpecimen above alluded to, and ſupported in an account oſ its manners given by Molina in his <hi rend="italic">Hſſl. Nat. da Chili,</hi>  treats this matter on more certain grounds, ſo as to enable us to give the following deſcription.</p><p>In ſize the American oſtrich is very little inferior to the common one : the bill is Hoped not unlike that of a gooſe, being flat on the top and rounded at the end r the eyes are black, and the lids furniſhed with hairs : the head is rounded, and covered with downy feathers : the neck is two feet eight inches long, and feathered alſo : from the tip of one wing to that of the other extended, the length is eight feet ; but from the want of continuity of the webs of the feathers, and their laxity of texture, the bird is unable to raiſe itſelf from the ground \ it is, however, capable of greatly affiſtiug itſelf by their motion in running, which it does very ſwiftly : the legs are ſtout, hare of feathers above the knees, and ſurniſhed with three toes, all placed forwards, each having a ſtraight and ſtout claw as in the caſſowary ; on the heel is a callous knob, ſerving in place of a back, toe : the general colour of plumage is dull grey mixed with white, inclining to the latter on the under parts : the tail is very lhort, and not conſpicuous, being entirely covered with long looſe and floating feathers, having origin from the lower part of the hack and rump, and entirely covering it : the bill and legs are brown.</p><p>Molina obſerves that this bird varies ; the body in ſome being white, in others black. In reſpect to manners, it is ſaid.to be a general feeder, but more ſond of flies, which it catches with great dexterity, and will alſo, like the common oſtrich, ſwallow bits oſ iron and<hi rend="sup">1 </hi>any other traſh offered to it. In common with the oſtrich of the old world, it lays a number of eggs, from. ' 40 to 60, in the fand, cacti of them holding a quart ;</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
