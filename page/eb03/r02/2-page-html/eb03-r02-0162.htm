<p><span class="font0">him ſo cloſely blocked up, that though his men were plentifully ſupplied with proviſions by ſea, yet the horſes of his army began ſoon to die in great numbers for&nbsp;want of forage. Cæſar’s men, though in the utmoſt&nbsp;diſtreſs for want of corn, yet bore all with’ incredible&nbsp;cheerfulneſs ; proteſting, that they would rather live&nbsp;upon the bark of trees than ſuffer Pompey to eſcape,&nbsp;now they had him in their power. Cæſar tells us, that&nbsp;in this extremity ſuch of the army as had been in Sardinia ſound out the way of making bread of a certain&nbsp;root called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">citera,</span><span class="font0"> which they ſteeped in milk ; and that&nbsp;when the enemy inſulted them on account of the ſtar-ving condition which they were in, they threw ſeveral&nbsp;of theſe loaves among them, to put them out of all&nbsp;hopes of ſubduing them by famine. “ So long as the&nbsp;earth produces ſuch roots (ſaid they), we will not let&nbsp;Pompey eſcape.” At length Pompey, alarmed at the&nbsp;diſtempers which began to prevail in his army, made&nbsp;ſeveral attempts to break through the barriers that incloſed him, but was always repulſed with loſs. At&nbsp;length, being reduced to the utmoſt extremity for want&nbsp;of forage, he reſolved at all events to force the enemy’s&nbsp;lines and eſcape. With the aſſiſtance, therefore, and&nbsp;by the advice of two deſerters, he embarked his archers,&nbsp;ſlingers, and light-armed infantry, and marching himſelf by land at the head of 60 cohorts, went to attack&nbsp;that part of Cæſar’s lines which was next to the ſea,&nbsp;and not yet quite finiſhed. He ſet out from his camp&nbsp;in the dead of the night, and arriving at the poſt he&nbsp;deſigned to force by break of day, he began the attack by ſea and land at the ſame time. The ninth&nbsp;legion, which defended that part of the lines, made for&nbsp;ſome time a vigorous reſiſtance ; but being attacked in&nbsp;the rear by Pompey’s men, who came by ſea, and landed between Cæſar’s two lines, they fled with ſuch precipitation, that the ſuccours Marcellinus ſent them ſrom&nbsp;a neighbouring poſt could not ſtop them. The enſign&nbsp;who carried the eagle at the head -of the routed legion&nbsp;was mortally wounded ; but nevertheleſs, before he&nbsp;died, had preſence of mind enough to conſign the eagle&nbsp;to the cavalry of the party, deſiring them to deliver it&nbsp;to Cæſar. Pompey’s men purſued the fugitives, and&nbsp;made ſuch a ſlaughter of them, that all the centurions&nbsp;of the firſt cohort were cut off except one. And now&nbsp;Pompey’s army broke in like a torrent upon the poſts&nbsp;Cæſar had fortified, and were advancing to attack Mar-cellinus, who guarded a neighbouring fort ; but Marc&nbsp;Antony coming very ſeaſonably to his relief with 12&nbsp;cohorts, they thought it adviſable to retire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Soon after Cæſar himſelf arrived with a ſtrong reinforcement, and poſted himſelf on the ſhore, in order to prevent ſuch attempts ſor the future. From this poſt&nbsp;he obſerved an old camp which he had made within the&nbsp;place where Pompey was incloſed, but afterwards abandoned. Upon his quitting </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">it,</span><span class="font0"> Pompey had taken poſſeſſion of it, and left a legion to guard it. This poſt&nbsp;Cæſar reſolved to reduce, hoping to repair the loſs he&nbsp;had ſuſtained on this unfortunate day, by taking the legion which Pompey had poſted there. Accordingly,&nbsp;lie advanced ſecretly at the head of 33 cohorts in two&nbsp;lines : and arriving at the old camp before Pompey&nbsp;could have notice of his march, attacked it with great&nbsp;vigour, forced the firſt intrenchment, notwithſtanding&nbsp;the brave reſiſtance of Titus Pulcio, and penetrated to&nbsp;the ſecond, whither the legion had retired. But here</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">his fortune changed on a ſudden. His right wing, in looking for an entrance into the camp, marched along&nbsp;the outſide of a trench which Cæſar had formerly carried on from the left angle of his camp, about 400&nbsp;paces, to a neighbouring river. This trench they miſ-toök for the rampart of the camp ; and being led away&nbsp;by that miſtake from their leſt wing, they were ſoon&nbsp;after prevented from rejoining it by the arrival of Pompey, who came up at the head of a legion and a large&nbsp;body of horſe. Then the legion which Cæſar had attacked taking courage, made a briſk ſally, drove his&nbsp;men back to the firſt intrenchment which they had&nbsp;ſeized, and there put them in gιeat diſorder while they&nbsp;were attempting to paſs the ditch. Pompey, in the&nbsp;mean time, falling upon them with his cavalry in flank,&nbsp;completed their defeat ; and then flying to the enemy’s&nbsp;right wing, which had paſſed the trench mentioned&nbsp;above, and was ſhut up between that and the ramparts&nbsp;of the old camp, made a moſt dreadful ſlaughter of them.&nbsp;The trench was filled with dead bodies, many falling&nbsp;into it in that diſorder, and others paſſing over them&nbsp;and preſſing them to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In this diſtreſs, Cæſar did all he could to ſtop the flight of his legionaries, but to no purpoſe: the ſtan-dard-bearers themſelves threw down the Roman eagles&nbsp;when Cæſar endeavoured to ſtop them, and left them&nbsp;in the hands of the enemy, who on this occaſion took&nbsp;32 ſtandards ; a diſgrace which Cæſar had never ſuffered before. He was himſelf in no ſmall danger of&nbsp;faffing by the hand of one of his own men, whom he&nbsp;took hold of when flying, bidding him ſtand and face&nbsp;about ; but the man, apprehenfιve of the danger he was&nbsp;in, drew his ſword, and would have killed him, had not&nbsp;one of his guards prevented the blow by cutting oſſhifi&nbsp;arm. Cæſar loſt on this occafιon 960 of his foot, 400&nbsp;of his horſe, 5 tribunes, and 32 centurions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This loſs and diſgrace greatly mortified Cæſar, but did not diſcourage him. After he had by his lenity&nbsp;and eloquent ſpeeches recovered the ſpirit of his troops,&nbsp;he decamped, and retired in good order to Apollonia,&nbsp;where he paid the army, and left his ſick and wounded.&nbsp;From thence he marched into Macedon, where Scipio&nbsp;Metellus, Pompey’s father-in-law, was encamped. He&nbsp;hoped either to draw his rival into ſome plain, or to&nbsp;overpower Scipio </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">if</span><span class="font0"> not aſſiſted. Pie met with great&nbsp;difficulties on his march, the countries through which&nbsp;he paſſed refuſing to ſupply his army with proviſions ;&nbsp;to ſuch a degree was his reputation ſunk ſince his lait&nbsp;defeat ! On his entering Theſſaly he was met by Domitius, one of his lieutenants, whom he had ſent with&nbsp;three legions to reduce Epirus. Having now got all&nbsp;his forces together, he marched directly to Gomphi,&nbsp;the firſt town of Theſſaly, which had been formerly in&nbsp;his intereſt, but now declared againſt him. Whereupon he attacked it with ſo much vigour, that though&nbsp;the garriſon was very numerous, and the waffs were of&nbsp;an uncommon height, he made himſelf maſter of it in </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">few hours. From hence he matched to Metropolis, another conſiderable town of Theſſaly, which immediately ſurrendered ; as did all the other cities of the country, except Lai iſſa, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font0">which Scipio had made himſelf&nbsp;maſter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the other hand, Pompey being continually importuned by the ſenators and officers of his army, left his camp at Dyrrhachium, anti followed Cæſar, firmly</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
