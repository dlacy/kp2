                    >No trustworthy figures are forthcoming as to the numbers of the English Roman
                    Catholics at the different stages of&nbsp;their history. At the accession of
                    Elizabeth they undoubtedly&nbsp;formed a large proportion </span><span
                    class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">the population. During her
                    reign&nbsp;they greatly decreased, and the decrease continued during the
                    17th&nbsp;century. Ä return, made with some apparent care soon after
                    the&nbsp;accession of William III., estimates their total number at
                    barely&nbsp;30,000. During the 18th century they began to increase; a
                    return&nbsp;presented to the House of Lbrds. in 1780 estimates their
                    number&nbsp;at nearly 70,000. Joseph Berington, himself a
                    distinguished&nbsp;Catholic priest, considers that this number was above the
                    mark;&nbsp;he reports that his co-religionists were most numerous in
                    Lancashire&nbsp;and London; next came Yorkshire, Northumberland and
                    Staffordshire. In many of the southern counties there were scarcely
                    any&nbsp;Catholics at all. Even in Berington’s time, however, there was
                    a&nbsp;certain tendency to increase; and the great number of
                    conversions&nbsp;that followed the Relief Act of 1791 was a stock argument
                    of&nbsp;opponents of the act of 1829. Of late years, notably since
                    the&nbsp;Oxford Movement within the Established Church, the number
                    of&nbsp;converts has been much increased; for some time past it has averaged
                    about 8000 souls a year. But a far more potent factor in&nbsp;swelling the
                    numbers of the Catholics has been the immigration of&nbsp;the Irish, which began
                    early in the 19th century, but was enormously&nbsp;stimulated by the famine of
                    1846. ln 1870 Mr Ravenstein reckoned&nbsp;the total number of Roman Catholics in
                    England as slightly under&nbsp;a million, of whom about 750,000 were Irish, and
                    50,000 foreigners.&nbsp;By 1910 the general total is considered to have risen to
                    about a&nbsp;million and a half.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(St C.)</span></p>

                    Popery Laws</span><span class="font1"> (1775). The Roman Catholic Emancipation
                    Act 1829 (10 Geo. IV. c. 7), although it gave Roman&nbsp;Catholic citizens in
                    the main complete civil and religious liberty,&nbsp;at the same time left them
                    under certain disabilities, trifling&nbsp;in comparison with those under which
                    they laboured before&nbsp;1829. Nor did the act affect in any way the long
                    series of old&nbsp;statutes directed against the assumption of authority by
                    the&nbsp;Roman see in England. The earliest of these which is still&nbsp;law is
                    the Statute of Provisors of 1351 (25 Edw. III. st. 4). The&nbsp;effect of the
                    Roman Catholic Charities Act 1832 is to place&nbsp;Roman Catholic schools,
                    places of worship and education, and&nbsp;charities, and the property held
                    therewith, under the laws&nbsp;applying to Protestant nonconformists. The
                    Toleration Act</span></p></div><br clear="all" /><div>
            <p><span class="font1">does not apply to Roman Catholics, but legislation of a similar
                    kind, especially the Relief Act of 1791 (31 Geo. III. c. 32),&nbsp;exempts the
                    priest from parochial offices, such as those of churchwarden and constable, and
                    from serving in the militia or on a&nbsp;jury, and enables all Roman Catholics
                    scrupling the oaths of&nbsp;office to exercise the office of churchwarden and
                    some other&nbsp;offices by deputy. The priest is, unlike the
                    nonconformist&nbsp;minister, regarded as being in holy orders. He cannot,
                    therefore, sit in the House of Commons, but there is nothing to&nbsp;prevent a
                    peer who is a priest from sitting and voting in the&nbsp;House of Lords. If a
                    priest becomes a convert to the Church&nbsp;of England he need not be
                    re-ordained. The remaining law&nbsp;affecting Roman Catholics may be classed
                    under the following&nbsp;five heads:—</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1"
                    style="font-style:italic;">Office.—</span><span class="font1">There are certain
                    offices still closed to Roman&nbsp;Catholics. By the Act of Settlement a papist
                    or the husband or&nbsp;wife of a papist cannot be king or queen. The act of 182p
                    provides&nbsp;that nothing therein contained is to enable a Roman Catholic
                    to&nbsp;hold the office of guardian and justice of the United Kingdom,
                    or&nbsp;of regent of the United Kingdom; of lord chancellor, lord
                    keeper,&nbsp;or lord commissioner of the great seal of Great Britain or
                    Ireland&nbsp;or lord lieutenant of Ireland; of high Commissioncrto the
                    General&nbsp;Assembly of the Church of Scotland, or of any office in the
                    Church&nbsp;of England or Scotland, the ecclesiastical courts, cathedral
                    foundations and certain colleges. The disability in the case of the
                    lord&nbsp;chancellor of Ireland was removed by statute in 1867, with
                    necessary&nbsp;limitations as to ecclesiastical patronage. The act of 1829
                    preserved the liability of Roman Catholics to take certain oaths of&nbsp;office,
                    but these have been modified by later legislation (see 29 &amp;&nbsp;30 Vict. c.
                    19; 30 &amp; 31 Vict. c. 75; 31 &amp; 32 Vict. c. 72; 34 &amp;&nbsp;35 Vict. c.
                    48). Legislation has been in the direction of omitting&nbsp;words which might be
                    supposed to give offence to Roman Catholics.&nbsp;The only offices which Roman
                    Catholics are not legally capable&nbsp;of holding now are the lord
                    chancellorship of England and the lord&nbsp;lieutenancy of Ireland (see,
                    however, Lilly and Wallis, pp. 36-43).</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1"
                    style="font-style:italic;">Title.—</span><span class="font1">The act of 1829
                    forbids the assumption by any person,&nbsp;other than the person authorized by
                    law, of the name, style or title&nbsp;of an archbishop, bishop or dean of the
                    Church of England. The&nbsp;Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1851 went further, and
                    forbade the assumption by an unauthorized person of a title from any place in
                    the&nbsp;United Kingdom., whether or not such place were the seat of
                    an&nbsp;archbishopric, bishopric or deanery. This act was,
                    however,&nbsp;repealed in 1867, but the provisions of the act of 1829 are still
                    in&nbsp;force.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1"
                    style="font-style:italic;">Religious Orders.—</span><span class="font1">It was
                    enacted by the act of 1829 that&nbsp;“ every Jesuit and every member of any
                    other religious order,&nbsp;community or society of the Church of Rome bound by
                    monastic&nbsp;or religious vows ” was, within six months after the
                    commencement&nbsp;of the act, to deliver to the clerk of the peace of the county
                    in&nbsp;which he should reside a notice or statement in the form given&nbsp;to
                    the schedule to the act, and that every Jesuit or member of&nbsp;such religious
                    order coming into the realm after the commencement of the act should be guilty
                    of a misdemeanour and should be&nbsp;banished from the United Kingdom for life
                    (with an exception in&nbsp;favour of natural-born subjects duly registered). A
                    secretary of&nbsp;state, being a Protestant, was empowered to grant licences
                    to&nbsp;Jesuits, &amp;c., to come into the United Kingdom and remain there
                    for&nbsp;a period not exceeding six months. An account of these
                    licences&nbsp;was to be laid annually before parliament. The admission of
                    any&nbsp;person as a regular ecclesiastic by any such Jesuit, &amp;c., was made
                    a&nbsp;misdemeanour, and the person so admitted was to be banished for
                    life.&nbsp;Nothing in the act was to extend to religious orders of
                    females.&nbsp;These provisions exist </span><span class="font1"
                    style="font-style:italic;">in posse</span><span class="font1"> only, and have,

                    style="font-style:italic;">Superstitious Uses.</span><span class="font1">—Gifts
                    to superstitious uses are void both&nbsp;at common law and by statute. It is not
                    easy to determine what&nbsp;gifts are to be regarded as gifts to superstitious
                    uses. Like contracts contrary to public policy, they depend to a great extent
                    for&nbsp;their illegality upon the discretion of the court in the particular
                    case.&nbsp;The act of 23 Hen. Vlll. c. 10 makes void any assurance of lands
                    to&nbsp;the use (to have obits perpetual) or the continual service of a
                    priest&nbsp;for ever or.for threescore or fourscore years. The act of 1 Edw.
                    VI.&nbsp;c. 14 (specially directed to the suppression of chantries) vests in
                    the&nbsp;crown all money paid by corporations and all lands appointed&nbsp;to
                    the finding or maintenance of any priest, or any anniversary or&nbsp;obit or
                    other like thing, or of any light or lamp in any church or&nbsp;chapel
                    maintained within five years before 1547. The act may still&nbsp;be of value in
                    the construction of old grants, and in affording examples of what the
                    legislature regarded as superstitious uses. Gifts&nbsp;which the courts have
                    held void on the analogy of those mentioned&nbsp;in the acts of Henry VIIL and
                    Edward VI. are a devise for the good&nbsp;of the soul of the testator, a bequest
                    to certain RomanCatholic priests&nbsp;that the testator may have the benefit of
                    their prayers and masses,&nbsp;a bequest in trust to apply a fund to circulate a
                    book teaching the&nbsp;supremacy of the pope in matters of faith, a bequest to
