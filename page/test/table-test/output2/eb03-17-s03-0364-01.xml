an ancient weapon of defence, in form of a light buckler, borne on the arm to fend off lances, darts, &amp; c. The form of the ſhield is repreſented by the eſcutcheon in coats of arms. The ſhield was that part of the ancient armour on which the perſons of diſtinction in the field of battle always had their arms painted ; and moſt of the words uſed at this time to expreſs the ſpace that holds the arms of families are derived from the Latin name for a s <hi rend="italic">hield, scutum.</hi> The French <hi rend="italic">eſcu and escussion,</hi> and the Engliſh word <hi rend="italic">eſcutcheon,</hi> or, as we commonly ſpeak it, sc <hi rend="italic">utcheon,</hi> are evidently from this origin ; and the Italian <hi rend="italic">ſcudo</hi> signifies both the ſhield of arms and that uſed in war. The Latin name <hi rend="italic">clypeus,</hi> for the ſame thing, ſeems alſo to be derived from<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0371.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0365"/>
the Greek word <hi rend="italic">to engrave ;</hi> and it had this name from the several figures engraved on it, as marks of diſtinction of the perſon who wore it.</p><p>The ſhield in war, among the Greeks and Romans, was not only uſeful in the defence of the body, but it was alſo a token, or badge of honour, to the wearer ; and he who returned from battle without it was always treated with infamy afterwards. People have at all times thought this honourable piece of the armour the propereſt place to engrave, or figure on the ſigns of dignity of the poſſeſſor of it ; and hence, when arms came to be painted for families in aftertimes, the heralds always choſe to repreſent them upon the figure of a ſhield, but with ſeveral exterior additions and ornaments ; as the helmet, ſupporters, and the rest.</p><p>The form of the ſhield has not only been found different in various nations, but even the people of the ſame nation, at different times, have varied its form extremely ; and among ſeveral people there have been ſhields of ſeveral forms and sizes in uſe, at the same period of time, and ſuited to different occaſions. The most ancient and universal form of ſhields, in the earlier ages, ſeems to have been the triangular. This we ſee inſtances of in all the monuments and gems of antiquity : our own most early monuments ſhow it to have been the moſt antique ſhape alſo with us, and the heralds have found it the moſt convenient for their purpoſes, when they had any odd number of figures to repreſent ; as if three, then two in the broad bottom part, and one in the narrow upper end, it held them very well; or if five, they ſtood as conveniently, as three below, and two above. The other form of a ſhield, now univerſally uſed, is ſquare, rounded, and pointed at the bottom : this is taken from the figure of the Samnitie ſhield uſed by the Romans, and ſince copied very generally by the Engliſh, French, and Germans.</p><p>The Spaniards and Portugueſe have the like general form of ſhields, but they are round at the bottom without the point ; and the Germans, beſide the Samnite- ſhield, have two others pretty much in uſe : theſe are, 1. The bulging ſhield, diſtinguiſhed by its ſwelling or bulging out at the flanks ; and, 2. The indented ſhield, or ſhield chancree, which has a number of notches and indentings all round its sides. The uſe of the ancient ſhield of this form was, that the notches ſerved to reſt the lance upon, that it might be firm while it gave the thruſt ; but this form being leſs proper for the receiving armorial figures, the two former have been much more uſed in the heraldry of that nation.</p><p>Beſide this different form of the ſhields in heraldry, we find them alſo often diſtinguiſhed by their different poſitions, ſome of them ſtanding erect, and others ſlanting various ways, and in different degrees ; this the heralds expreſs by the word pendant. "hanging,” they seeming to be hung up not by the centre, but by the right or left corner. The French call theſe <hi rend="italic">ecu pendant,</hi> and the common antique triangular ones ecu <hi rend="italic">ancien.</hi> The Italians call this <hi rend="italic">ſcuto pendente</hi>; and the reaſon given for exhibiting the ſhield in theſe figures in heraldry is, that in the ancient tilts and tournaments, they who were to juſt at theſe military exerciſes, were obliged to hang up their ſhields with their armories, or coats of arms on them, out at the windows and balconies of the houſes near the place ; or upon trees, pavilions, or the barriers of the</p><p>ground, if the exerciſe was to be performed in the</p><p>field. Thoſe who were to fight on foot; according to Columbier, had their ſhields hung up by the right corner, and thoſe who were to fight on horſeback had theirs hung up by the left. This poſition of the ſhields in heraldry is called <hi rend="italic">couche by</hi> ſome writers, though by the generality <hi rend="italic">pendant.</hi></p><p>It was very frequent in all parts of Europe, in arms given between the 11th and 14th centuries; but it is to be obſerved, that the hanging by the left corner, as it was the token of the owner’s being to fight on horſeback, ſo it was eſteemed the moſt honourable and noble situation ; and all the pendant ſhields of the ſons of the royal family of Scotland and England, and of our nobility at that time, are thus hanging from the left corner. The hanging from this corner was a token of the owner’s being of noble birth, and having fought in the tournaments before ; but no ſovereign ever had a ſhield pendant any way, but always erect, as they never formally entered the lists of the tournament.</p><p>The Italians generally have their ſhields of arms of an oval form ; this ſeems to be done in imitation of thoſe of the popes and other dignified clergy : but their herald Petro Sancto ſeems to regret the uſe of this figure of the ſhield, as an innovation brought in by the painters and engravers as moſt convenient for holding the figures, but derogatory to thc honour of the poſſeſſor, as not repreſenting either antiquity or honours won in war, but rather the honours of ſome citizen or person of learning. Some have carried it ſo far as to lay, that thoſe who either have no ancient title to nobility, or have ſullied it by any unworthy action, cannot any longer wear their arms in ſhields properly figured, but were obliged to have them painted in an oval or round ſhield.</p><p>In Flanders, where this author lived, the round and oval ſhields are in the diſrepute he ſpeaks of; but in Italy, beſide the popes and dignified prelates, many of the firſt families of the laity have them.</p><p>The ſecular princes, in many other countries, alſo retain this form of the ſhield, as the moſt ancient and truly expressive of the Roman clypeus.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Shield,</hi> in heraldry, the eſcutcheon or field on which the bearings of coats of arms are placed.
