<p><span class="font0">Major-General Garvock, in the Umbeyla campaign among the mountains to the north of Peshawar, and was present at the&nbsp;storm of Lain, the capture of Umbeyla, and the destruction of&nbsp;Mulka, receiving for his services the medal and clasp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1867 Roberts was appointed assistant quartermaster-general to Sir Donald Stewart’s Bengal Brigade for Abyssinia. He showed judgment in embarking each unit complete in&nbsp;every detail, instead of despatching camp equipage in one&nbsp;ship, transport in another, and so on, as was customary. He&nbsp;arrived at Zula, Annesley Bay, in the Red Sea, the base of the&nbsp;expedition, on the 3rd of February 1868, and remained there&nbsp;as senior base staff officer during the four months’ campaign.&nbsp;At its close he superintended the re-embarkation of the whole&nbsp;army. His duties were so well performed that Sir Robert Napier&nbsp;sent him home with his final despatches. He was three times&nbsp;“ mentioned,” and received a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy and&nbsp;the war medal. He returned to India the following year as&nbsp;first assistant quartermaster-general. In the autumn of 1871&nbsp;he made the arrangements for the expedition into Lushai,&nbsp;between south-east Bengal and Burma, fitted out two columns&nbsp;under Brigadiers-General Bourchier and Brownlow, and himself&nbsp;accompanied the first. A road, over 100 m. long, was cut&nbsp;through dense gloomy forests in stifling heat, and the column&nbsp;was attacked by cholera; but the object of the expedition&nbsp;was successfully accomplished, and Roberts, who was present&nbsp;at the capture of the Kholel villages and the action in the&nbsp;Northlang range, and commanded the troops at the burning&nbsp;of Taikum, was mentioned in despatches and made a Companion&nbsp;of the Bath. On his return in March 1872, he became deputy&nbsp;quartermaster-general in Bengal, and in 1875 quartermaster-general and colonel. He settled the details of the great camp&nbsp;of exercise at Delhi on the occasion of the visit of the prince&nbsp;of Wales in January 1876, and attended H.R.H. at the manœuvres. He also superintended the arrangements for the great&nbsp;durbar at Delhi on the ist of January 1877, when Queen Victoria&nbsp;was proclaimed empress of India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1878 Roberts was appointed to the command of the Frontier Field Force at Abbottabad, in Hazara; but in the&nbsp;autumn, on the repulse of the Chamberlain Mission by the&nbsp;Afghans, and the formation of three columns to advance into&nbsp;Afghanistan by the Khyber, the Bolan and the Kurram passes,&nbsp;he was given the command of the Kurram Field Force, with&nbsp;the rank of major-general. Concentrating his column at Thal,&nbsp;he advanced to Kurram towards the end of November, and&nbsp;having formed an advanced base there, moved on to Habib&nbsp;Kila. Under cover of preparations for a front attack on the&nbsp;Peiwar Kotal, he reconnoitred that formidable position, and&nbsp;on the night of the ist of December moved part of his force&nbsp;to attack the Spingawi Kotal, in order to turn the Afghan left&nbsp;flank, leaving the remainder of the force to feign a front attack&nbsp;on the Peiwar, and to guard the camp. After a very difficult&nbsp;night march the Spingawi Kotal was carried at daybreak on&nbsp;the 2nd, and, later, the Afghans on the Peiwar Kotal, threatened&nbsp;in rear, abandoned the position. The next morning Roberts&nbsp;occupied the Peiwar, and on the 6th advanced to Ali KheL&nbsp;He reconnoitred the Shutargardan and the Sapari passes, and&nbsp;made a strong reconnaissance through Khost, in which some&nbsp;fighting took place, and at the end of January returned to Hagir&nbsp;Pir, in Kurram, where his force remained in occupation. In&nbsp;July Major Cavagnari, the British envoy to the new amir,&nbsp;Yakub Khan, passed through Kurram on his way to Kabul,&nbsp;and, shortly afterwards, Roberts left his Kurram command&nbsp;and went to Simla to take his seat on the army commission,&nbsp;where he strongly advocated the abolition of the three Presidency armies, and the substitution for them of four army&nbsp;corps, a measure which was carried out sixteen years later.&nbsp;While he was at Simla, news arrived on the 5th of September&nbsp;of the murder of Cavagnari and his companions at Kabul.&nbsp;The Peshawar Valley Force had been broken up; Sir Donald&nbsp;Stewart was still at Kandahar, but most of his troops had&nbsp;started for India; Roberts, therefore, had the only force ready&nbsp;to strike rapidly at Kabul. It was hastily reinforced, and he&nbsp;hurried back to Kurram to take command, as a lieutenant-general, of the Kabul Field Force (7500 men and 22 guns).&nbsp;By the 19th of September a brigade was entrenched on the&nbsp;Shutargardan, and as Roberts advanced, the Amir Yakub&nbsp;Khan came into his camp. An Afghan force of 8000 men&nbsp;blocked the way in a strong position on the heights beyond&nbsp;Charasia, and on the 6th of October Roberts repeated the&nbsp;tactics that had done him such good service at the Peiwar in&nbsp;the previous year, and sending Brigadier-General T. D. Baker&nbsp;with the greater part of his force to turn the Afghan right&nbsp;flank, threatened the pass in front with the remainder. By&nbsp;the afternoon Baker had seized the position, and the enemy,&nbsp;severely defeated, were in full retreat. Kabul was occupied&nbsp;without further opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The city was spared, but punishment was meted out to those convicted of complicity in the murder of the British&nbsp;Mission. Yakub Khan abdicated on the 12th of October,&nbsp;and was eventually deported to India. The troops occupied&nbsp;the Sherpur cantonments; but in November a religious war&nbsp;was proclaimed by the Mullahs, and early in December, in order&nbsp;to prevent a threatening combination of Afghan tribes against&nbsp;him, Roberts moved out two columns to attack them in detail.&nbsp;After considerable fighting around Kabul, the numbers of the&nbsp;enemy were so great that he was forced to concentrate his&nbsp;troops again at Sherpur, the defences of which had been greatly&nbsp;improved and strengthened. Sherpur was invested by the&nbsp;enemy, and early on the 23rd of December was attacked by&nbsp;over 100,000 Afghans. They were driven off with great loss;&nbsp;and on making a second attempt to storm the place, were&nbsp;met by Roberts, who moved out, attacked them in flank, and&nbsp;defeated them, when they broke and dispersed. Roberts now&nbsp;recommended the political dismemberment of Afghanistan,&nbsp;and negotiations were carried on with the northern tribes for&nbsp;the appointment of an amir for the Kabul district only. On&nbsp;the 5th of May Sir Donald Stewart arrived with his column&nbsp;from Kandahar and assumed the supreme command in Afghanistan, Roberts retaining, under Stewart, the command of the&nbsp;two Kabul divisions, and organizing an efficient transport&nbsp;corps under Colonel R. Low, which was soon to be of inestimable&nbsp;value. On the 22nd of July Abdur Rahman was proclaimed&nbsp;Amir of Kabul; and Roberts was preparing to withdraw his&nbsp;troops to India by the Kurrara route, when news arrived that&nbsp;a British brigade had been totally defeated at Maiwand on&nbsp;the 27th of July, and that Lieutenant-General Primrose was&nbsp;besieged in Kandahar. Roberts was ordered to proceed thither&nbsp;at once with a specially selected column of 10,000 troops&nbsp;and his new transport corps. He started on his famous&nbsp;march on the 9th of August and arrived at Kandahar on the&nbsp;morning of the 31st, having covered 313 miles in twenty-two&nbsp;days. On the following day he fought the battle of Kandahar&nbsp;and gained a complete victory. His services in the Afghan&nbsp;campaigns of 1878 to 1880 are recorded in eight </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gazettes,</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;were recognized by the thanks of both Houses of Parliament,&nbsp;of the Government of India, and of the Governor-General in&nbsp;Council. He was created K.C.B., G.C.B. and a baronet, received the medal with four clasps and the bronze star, and&nbsp;was given the command of the Madras army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Before proceeding to Madras, Roberts went home on furIough, and when the news of the disaster at Majuba Hill in South&nbsp;Africa arrived in London at the end of February 1881, he was&nbsp;appointed governor of Natal and commander-in-chief in South&nbsp;Africa. He arrived at Cape Town to find that peace had been&nbsp;made with the Boers, and that instructions were awaiting him&nbsp;to return home. The same year he attended the autumn&nbsp;manœuvres in Hanover as the guest of the German emperor.&nbsp;He declined the post of quartermaster-general to the forces&nbsp;in succession to Sir Garnet Wolseley, and returned to India,&nbsp;arriving at Madras in November. The following year he visited&nbsp;Burma with the viceroy, and in 1885 attended the meeting&nbsp;between Abdur Rahman and Yord Dufferin at Rawalpindi at&nbsp;the time of the Panjdeh incident, in connexion with which&nbsp;he had been nominated to the command of an army corps in</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
