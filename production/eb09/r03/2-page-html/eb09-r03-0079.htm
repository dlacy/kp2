        <p><span class="font2">the people backed by a written recommendation from the dictator,
                which was equivalent to a command.@@<sup>1</sup> Finally,&nbsp;the senate itself was
                transformed out of all likeness to its&nbsp;former self by the raising of its
                numbers to 900, and by&nbsp;the admission of old soldiers, sons of freedmen, and
                even&nbsp;“semi-barbarous Gauls.”@@<sup>2</sup> But, though Cæsar’s highhanded
                conduct in this respect was not imitated by his&nbsp;immediate successors, yet the
                main lines of their policy&nbsp;were laid down by him. These were (1) the
                municipalization of the old republican constitution, and (2) its subordination to
                the paramount authority of the master of the&nbsp;legions and the provinces. In the
                first case he only&nbsp;carried further a change already in progress. Of
                late&nbsp;years the senate had been rapidly losing its hold over the&nbsp;empire at
                large. Even the ordinary proconsuls were&nbsp;virtually independent potentates,
                ruling their provinces&nbsp;as they chose, and disposing absolutely of legions
                which&nbsp;recognized no authority but theirs. The consuls and&nbsp;prætors of each
                year had since 81 been stationed in Rome,&nbsp;and immersed in purely municipal
                business; and, lastly,&nbsp;since the enfranchisement of Italy, the comitia, though
                still&nbsp;recognized as the ultimate source of all authority, had&nbsp;become
                little more than assemblies of the city populace,&nbsp;and their claim to represent
                the true Roman people was&nbsp;indignantly questioned, even by republicans like
                Cicero.&nbsp;The concentration in Cæsar’s hands of all authority outside Rome
                completely and finally severed all real connection between the old institutions of
                the republic of&nbsp;Rome and the government of the Roman empire. And,&nbsp;though
                Augustus and Tiberius elevated the senate to a&nbsp;place beside themselves in this
                government, its share of&nbsp;the work was a subordinate one, and it never
                again&nbsp;directed the policy of the state ; while, from the time of&nbsp;Cæsar
                onwards, the old magistracies are merely municipal&nbsp;offices, with a steadily
                diminishing authority, even in the&nbsp;city, and the comitia retain no other
                prerogative of&nbsp;imperial importance but that of formally confirming
                the&nbsp;ruler of the empire in the possession of an authority which&nbsp;is already
                his. But the institutions of the republic not&nbsp;merely became, what they had
                originally been, the local&nbsp;institutions of the city of Rome ; they were also
                subordinated even within these narrow limits to the paramount&nbsp;authority of the
                man who held in his hands the army and&nbsp;the provinces. And here Cæsar’s policy
                was closely&nbsp;followed by his successors. Autocratic abroad, at home&nbsp;he was
                the chief magistrate of the commonwealth ; and&nbsp;this position was marked, in his
                case as in that of those&nbsp;who followed him, by a combination in his person
                of&nbsp;various powers, and by a general right of precedence&nbsp;which left no
                limits to his authority but such as he chose&nbsp;to impose upon himself. During the
                greater part of his&nbsp;reign he was consul as well as dictator.@@<sup>3</sup> In
                48, after&nbsp;his victory at Pharsalia, he was given the “tribunicia&nbsp;potestas
                ” for life,@@<sup>4</sup> and after his second success at Thapsus&nbsp;the “
                praefectura morum ” for three years.@@<sup>5</sup> As chief&nbsp;magistrate he
                convenes and presides in the senate, nominates candidates, conducts elections,
                carries laws in the&nbsp;assembly, and administers justice in court.@@<sup>6</sup>
                Finally, as&nbsp;a reminder that the chief magistrate of Rome was also&nbsp;the
                autocratic ruler of the empire, he wore even in Rome&nbsp;the laurel wreath and
                triumphal dress, and carried the&nbsp;sceptre of the victorious
                    imperator.@@<sup>7</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Nor are we without some clue as to the policy which</span></p>
 
        <p><span class="font2">Cæsar had sketched out for himself in the administration of the
                empire, the government of which he had centralized in his own hands. The much-needed
                work of rectifying the frontiers ho was forced, by his premature&nbsp;death, to
                leave to other hands, but our authorities agree&nbsp;in attributing to him the
                design of extending the rule of&nbsp;Rome to its natural geographical limits
                    @@<sup>8</sup>—to the Euphrates&nbsp;and the Caucasus on the east, to the Danube
                and the&nbsp;Rhine or possibly the Elbe on the north, and to the ocean&nbsp;on the
                west. Within the frontiers he anticipated Augustus&nbsp;in lightening the financial
                burdens of the provincials,@@<sup>9&nbsp;</sup>and in establishing a stricter
                control over the provincial&nbsp;governors,@@<sup>10</sup> while he went beyond him
                in his desire to&nbsp;consolidate the empire by extending the Roman
                    franchise@@<sup>11&nbsp;</sup>and admitting provincials to a share in the
                    government.@@<sup>12&nbsp;</sup>He completed the Romanization of Italy by his
                enfranchisement of the Transpadane Gauls,@@<sup>13</sup> and by
                establishing&nbsp;throughout the peninsula a uniform system of
                municipal&nbsp;government, which under his successors was gradually&nbsp;extended to
                the provinces.@@<sup>14</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">On the eve of his departure for the East, to avenge the death of
                Crassus and humble the power of Parthia, Cæsar&nbsp;fell a victim to the wounded
                pride of the republican nobles ;&nbsp;and between the day of his death (March 15,
                44) and that&nbsp;on which Octavian defeated Antonyat Actium (September&nbsp;2, 31)
                lies a dreary period of anarchy and bloodshed.@@<sup>15</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">For a moment, in spite of the menacing attitude of Cæsar’s
                self-constituted representative Antony, it seemed to&nbsp;one man at least as if the
                restoration of republican government was possible. With indefatigable energy
                Cicero&nbsp;strove to enlist the senate, the people, and above all
                the&nbsp;provincial governors in support of the old constitution.&nbsp;But, though
                his eloquence now and again carried all before&nbsp;it in senate house and forum, it
                was powerless to alter&nbsp;the course of events. By the beginning of 43 civil
                war&nbsp;had recommenced ; in the autumn Antony was already&nbsp;threatening an
                invasion of Italy at the head of seventeen&nbsp;legions. Towards the end of October
                Antony and his ally&nbsp;Lepidus coalesced with the young Octavian, who had
                been&nbsp;recently elected consul at the age of twenty, in spite of&nbsp;senatorial
                opposition ; and the coalition was legalized by&nbsp;the creation of the
                extraordinary commission for the&nbsp;“ reorganization of the commonwealth ” known
                as the&nbsp;“second triumvirate.”@@<sup>16</sup> It was appointed for a period
                of&nbsp;five years, and was continued in 37 for five years
                    more.@@<sup>17&nbsp;</sup>The rule of the triumvirs was inaugurated in the
                Sullan&nbsp;fashion, and, in marked contrast to the lenity shown by&nbsp;Cæsar, by a
                proscription, foremost among the victims of&nbsp;which was Cicero
                    himself.@@<sup>18</sup> In the next year the defeat&nbsp;of Brutus and Cassius
                at Philippi, by the combined forces&nbsp;of Octavian and Antony, destroyed the last
                hopes of the&nbsp;republican party.@@<sup>19</sup> In 40 a threatened rupture
                between&nbsp;the two victors was avoided by the treaty concluded at&nbsp;Brundusium.
