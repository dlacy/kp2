We have already ſeen, that when the weight of a ſquare yard of covering is given, a ſteeper roof requires ſtronger rafters, and that when the ſeantling of ■the timbers is alſo given, tlιe relative ſtrength of a rafter is inverſely as its length. But there is now another circumſtance to be taken into the account, viz. the ſupport which one rafter leg gives to the other. The beſt form of a rafter will therefore be that in which the relative ■ſtrength of the legs, and their mutual ſupport, give the greateſt product. Mr Muller, in his <hi rend="italic">Military Engineer, </hi>gives a determination of the beſt pitch of a roof, which has conſiderable ingenuity, and has been copied into many books of military education both in this iſland and on the continent. Deſcribe on the width A C, ſig. 13. the ſemicircle AFC, and biſect it by the radius F D. Produce the rafter A B to the circumference in E, join EC, and draw the perpendicular E G.—</p><p>Now A B : AD = A C : A E, and AE = Λ¾Δ<hi rend="sup">c</hi>,A 13</p><p>and AE is inverſely as AB, and may therefore repre-ſent its ſtrength in relation to the weight actually lying «η it.' Alſo the ſupport which CB gives to AB is as CE, becauſe CE is perpendicular to AB. Therefore the form which renders A E × E C a maximum ſeems to be that which has the greateſt ſtrength. But A C :</p><p>AE E C</p><p>A E = E C : E G, and E G=—~ſſlg—» <hi rend="sup">an</hi>^ is therefore proportional to AE.EC. Now E G is a maximum when B is in F, and a ſquare pitch is in this reſpect the ſtrongeſt. But it is very doubtful whether this conſtruction is deduced from juſt principles. There is another ſtrain to which the leg A B is expoſed, which is not taken into the account. This ariſes from the curvature which it unavoidably acquires by the tranſverſe preſſure of its load. In this ſtate it is preſſed in its own direction by the abutment and load of the other leg. The relation between this ſtrain and the reſiſtance of the piece is not very diſtinctly known. Euler has given a diſſertation on this ſubject (which is of great importance, becauſe it affects poſts and pillars of all kinds ; and it is very well known that a poſt of ten feet long and fix inches ſquare will bear with great ſafety a weight which would cruſh a poſt of the ſame ſeantling and 20 feet long in a minute) ; but his determination has not been acquieſced in by the firſt mathematicians. Now it is in relation to theſe two ſtrains that the ſtrength of the rafter ſhould be adjuſted. The ſineneſs of the ſupport given by the other leg is of no conſequence, if its own ſtrength is inferior to the ſtrain. The force which tends to cruſh the leg A B, by compreſſing it in its curved ſtate, is to its weight as A B to B D, as is eaſily ſeen by the compoſition of forces; and its incurvation by this force has a relation to it, which is of intricate determination. It is contained in the properties demonſtrated by Bernoulli of the elaſtic curve. This determination alſo includes the relation between the curvature and the length of the piece. But the whole of this ſeemingly ſimple problem is of much more difficult inveſtigation than Mr Muller was aware of ; and his rules for the pitch of a roof, and for the ſally of a dock gate, which depends on the ſame principles, are of no value. He is, however, the firſt author who attempted to ſolve either of theſe problems on mechanical principles ſuſceptible of preciſe reaſoning. Belidor’s ſolu-⅞ions, in his<hi rend="italic">Architecture Hydraulique<hi rend="sub">t</hi></hi>  are below notice.</p><p>Reaſqns of ’economy have made carpenters prefer a low pitch ; and although this does diminiſh the ſup-port given by the oppoſite leg falter than it increaſes the relative ſtrength of the other, this is not 9f material conſequence, becauſe the ſtrength remaining in the oppoſite leg is ſtill very great ; for the ſupporting leg is acting againſt compreſſion, in which caſe it is vaſtly ſtronger than the ſupported leg acting againſt a tranſverſe ſtrain.</p><p>But a roof of this ſimplicity will not do in moſt caſes. There is no notice taken in its conſtruction of the thruſt which it exerts on the walls. Now this is the ſtrain which is the moſt hazardous of all. Our ordinary walls, inſtead of being able to reſiſt any conſiderable ſtrain preſſing them outwards, require, in general, ſome ties to keep them on foot. When a perſon thinks of the thinneſs and height of the walls of even a ſtrong houſe, he will be ſurpriſed that they are uot blown down by any ſtrong puff of wund. A wall of three feet thick, and 60 feet high, could not withſtand a wind blowing at the rate of 30 feet <hi rend="italic">per</hi>  ſecond (in which caſe it acts with a force conſiderably exceeding two pounds on every ſquare foot), if it were not ſtiſſened by croſs walls, joiſts, and roof, which all help to tie the different parts of the building together.</p><p>A carpenter is therefore exceedingly careful to avoid every horizontal thruſt, or to oppoſe them by other<hi rend="sup">i </hi>forces. And this introduces another eſſential part into the conſtruction of a roof, namely the<hi rend="italic">tie</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">beam</hi>  A C, (<hi rend="sup">fi</hi>ff∙ 14.), laid from wall to wall, binding the feet A and C of the rafters together. This is the ſole office qf the beam ; and it ſhould be conſidered in no other light than as a firing to prevent the roof from puffing out the walls. It is indeed uſed for carrying the ceiling of the apartments under it ; and it is even made to ſupporta flooring. But, conſidered as making part of a roof, it is merely a ſtring ; and the ſtrain which it w<hi rend="sup">,</hi>ithftandp tends to tear its parts aſunder. It therefore acts with its whole abſolute force, and a very ſmall ſeantling would ſuffice if we could contrive to faſten it firmly enough to the foot of the rafter. If it is of oak, we may ſafely ſubject it to a ſtrain of three tons for every ſquare inch of its ſection. And fir will ſafely bear a ſtrain of two tons for every ſquare inch. But we are obliged to give the tie-beam much larger dimenſions, that we may be able to connect it with the foot of the rafter by a mor-tiſe and tenon. Iron ſtraps are alſo frequently added. By attending to this office of the tie-beam, the judicious carpenter is directed to the proper form of the mor-tiſe and tenon and of the ſtrap. We ſhall eonſider both of theſe in a proper place, after we become acquainted with the various ſtrains at the joints of a roof.</p><p>Theſe large dimenſions of the tie-beam allow us to load it with the ceilings without any riſk, and even to lay floors on it with moderation and caution. But when it has a great bearing or ſpan, it is very apt to bend downwards in the middle, or, as the workmen term it, to ſway or ſwag ; and it requires a ſupport. The queſtion is, where to find this ſupport ? What fixed points can we find with which to connect the middle of the tie-beam ? Some ingenious carpenter thought of ſuſpending it from the ridge by a piece of timber B D (fig. 15.), called by our carpenters the <hi rend="italic">kiηg-poft.</hi>  It muſt be acknowledged that there was great ingenuity in this thought. It was alſo perfectly juſt. For the weight of the rafters B A, BC tends to make them fly</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
