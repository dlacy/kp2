<p><label>RAJAH CHOHANS</label>
a wild, rugged, and mountainous country, very little cultivated, in the province of Gundwa-na, and situated between the 23d and 24th degrees of north latitude. The principal town is Sonehut, the usual residence of the Corair rajah. This tract of country is inhabited by the wildest tribes of India, and presents one continued succession of deep gullies, ravines, chasms, and defiles. The inhabitants are very poor, being collected in villages, which consist of not more than four or five huts each. A little rice, Indian corn, and a few other smaller grains, are the chief products. The country affords abundant cover for game of all sorts ; and tigers, leopards, tiger-cats, and large black bears, abound in its woods and jungles.</p>
