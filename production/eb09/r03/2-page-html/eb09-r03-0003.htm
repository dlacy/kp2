<p><span class="font1">Tlie difficulty was overcome by accepting the principle of agnation upon which the patrician </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font1"> was constructed,&nbsp;and establishing an agnatic circle of kinsmen within the&nbsp;sixth degree, to which the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font1"> as a corporation should be&nbsp;postponed in the case of the patricians, and which should&nbsp;come in place of it in the case of the plebeians. It was&nbsp;not perfect equalization, but the nearest approach to it that&nbsp;the circumstances permitted. The difference was that,&nbsp;when the agnates of a plebeian intestate failed, his inheritance was vacant, whereas, on failure of those of a patrician,&nbsp;there was devolution to his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font1"> in its collective capacity.&nbsp;And this devolution was rendered all the more frequent by&nbsp;two “interpretations” put upon the statute,—(1) that, if&nbsp;the nearest agnates in existence declined the succession,&nbsp;those next in degree were not allowed to take it • and (2)&nbsp;that no female agnate could take it except a sister of the&nbsp;deceased intestate. The division among two or more&nbsp;agnates was always </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per capita,</span><span class="font1"> not </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per stirpes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The order of intestate succession thus established by the XII. Tables, which prevailed until amended by the&nbsp;praetors probably in the 8th century of the city, was first&nbsp;to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sui heredes</span><span class="font1"> of the deceased, next to liis nearest&nbsp;agnate or agnates, and finally, if the deceased was a patrician, to his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens.</span><span class="font1"> His </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sui heredes</span><span class="font1"> included those of his descendants in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span class="font1"> when he died who by that event&nbsp;(or even after it, but before his intestacy became manifest)&nbsp;became </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sui juris,</span><span class="font1"> together with his wife </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in manu</span><span class="font1"> (who, as&nbsp;regarded his succession, was reckoned as a daughter); but&nbsp;they did not include children whom lie had emancipated or&nbsp;daughters who had passed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in manum</span><span class="font1"> of a husband. Emancipated children did not even come in as agnates on failure&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sui;</span><span class="font1"> for emancipation severed the tie of agnation as well&nbsp;as that of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">potestas.</span><span class="font1"> For the same reason no kinsman who&nbsp;had been emancipated, and so cut off from the family tree,&nbsp;could claim as an agnate; for those only were agnates who&nbsp;were subject to the same </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas,</span><span class="font1"> or would have&nbsp;been had the common family head been still alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The opening of a succession (technically </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dclatio hereditatis)</span><span class="font0"> in favour of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sui heredes,</span><span class="font0"> whether in virtue of a testamentary institution or by operation of law on intestacy, at once invested them&nbsp;with the character, rights, and responsibilities of heirs. No acceptance was necessary, nor, according to the rules of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile,</span><span class="font0"> was&nbsp;any declinature competent. They had been all along in a manner&nbsp;joint owners with their parent of the family estate, which by his&nbsp;death had become, nominally at least, an inheritance; and, as he&nbsp;had not thought fit to terminate their interest in it by emancipating or disinheriting them, they were not now allowed to disown&nbsp;it. Hence they were spoken of as necessary heirs </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{heredes sui et&nbsp;necessarii).</span><span class="font0"> A slave, too, whom his owner had instituted in his&nbsp;testament was a necessary heir: he could not decline, and was&nbsp;invested with the character of heir the moment the testator died.&nbsp;Not so with stranger institutes or agnates taking on intestacy:&nbsp;they were free to take or reject the inheritance as they saw fit;&nbsp;consequently an act of acceptance </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{aditio)</span><span class="font0"> was necessary on their&nbsp;part to make them heirs. It was not unusual for a testator, in&nbsp;instituting an heir, to require that he should make a formal declaration of acceptance within a limited time, failing which his&nbsp;right should pass to a substitute, who in turn was required to enter&nbsp;within a certain time ; and so on with any number of substitutes,&nbsp;the series ending with one of his slaves, who became heir without&nbsp;entry, and thus saved the testator from the disgrace of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">post mortem&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">bankruptcy in the event of the inheritance proving insolvent.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">uli leyassit</span><span class="font0"> of the Tables, as already remarked, conferred upon&nbsp;a testator very great latitude of testamentary disposition, even to&nbsp;the extent of disherison of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sui heredes.</span><span class="font0"> This was a course, however, that was rarely resorted to unless when a child had been&nbsp;guilty of gross ingratitude, or when the parent had reason to believe&nbsp;his estate was insolvent and desired to protect his children from&nbsp;the responsibilities of inheritance. Usually his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sui,</span><span class="font0"> if he had any,&nbsp;would be his institutes, and the purpose of the testament either to&nbsp;apportion the estate amongst them as he thought expedient, or to&nbsp;give him an opportunity of appointing tutors, bequeathing legacies,&nbsp;or enfranchising slaves. On intestacy the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sui</span><span class="font0"> took equally, but&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">per stirpes; </span><span class="font0">that is to say, grandchildren by a son who had&nbsp;predeceased or been emancipated, but who themselves had been&nbsp;retained in their grandfather’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">potestas,</span><span class="font0"> took amongst them the&nbsp;share to which their father would otherwise have been entitled,&nbsp;instead of taking equal shares with their surviving uncles. It was&nbsp;by no means uncommon, when the whole inheritance descended to&nbsp;sons, for them to hold it in common for many years as partners&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{consortes}</span><span class="font0">; but any one of them was entitled at any moment to claim&nbsp;a partition, which was effected judicially, by an arbitral procedure&nbsp;introduced, termed a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">judicium</span><span class="font0"> (or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">arbitrium) familias erciscundae.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Where two or more strangers were instituted testamentarily, whether&nbsp;to equal or unequal shares, if one of them failed either by predecease&nbsp;or declinature his share accrued </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ipso jure</span><span class="font0"> to the others ; for it was&nbsp;a rule that very early became proverbial that a man could not die&nbsp;partly testate and partly intestate. There was the same accrual&nbsp;among agnates on intestacy ; and both they and stranger testamentary institutes had the same action for division of the inheritance&nbsp;that was made use of by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sui heredes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">According to Gaius it was as a stimulus to heirs to enter as soon as possible to an inheritance that had opened to them, and thus&nbsp;make early provision alike for satisfying the claims of creditors of&nbsp;the deceased and attending to his family </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sacra,</span><span class="font0"> that the law came&nbsp;to recognize the somewhat remarkable institution of usucapion or&nbsp;prescriptive acquisition of the inheritance in the character of heir&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{ usucapió pro herede}.</span><span class="font0"> Such usucapion was impossible—there was&nbsp;no room for it—if the deceased had left </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sui heredes</span><span class="font0">; for the inheritance vested in them the moment he died. But, if there were no&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sui heredes,</span><span class="font0"> then any person taking possession of the property&nbsp;that had belonged to the deceased, and holding it for twelve months&nbsp;without interruption, thereby acquired it as if he were heir: in&nbsp;fact, according to the views then held, he acquired the inheritance&nbsp;itself. Gaius characterizes it as a dishonest acquisition, inasmuch&nbsp;as the usucapient knew that what he had taken ytossession of was&nbsp;not his. But, as already explained, the usucapion of the XII.&nbsp;Tables did not require </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bona fidcs</span><span class="font0"> on the part of the usucapient; he&nbsp;might acquire ownership by prolonged possession of what he knew&nbsp;did not belong to him so long as he did not appropriate it theftu-ously, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0">, knowing that it belonged to another. But an inheritance unappropriated by an heir who had nothing more than a right&nbsp;to claim it belonged in strictness to no one ; and there was no&nbsp;theft, therefore, when a person took possession of it with a view to&nbsp;usucapion in the character of heir. There can be little doubt that&nbsp;on the completion of his possession he was regarded as heir just as&nbsp;fully as if he had taken under a testament or as heir-at-law on intestacy,—that is to say, that he was held responsible to creditors&nbsp;of the deceased and required to charge himself with the family&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sacra.</span><span class="font0"> Gaius does not say as much ; but both the Coruncanian&nbsp;and the Mucian edict imposed the latter burden upon him who had&nbsp;usucapted by possession the greater part of a deceased person’s&nbsp;estate ; and it is but reasonable to suppose that the burden of debts&nbsp;must in like manner have fallen on the usucapient or usucapients&nbsp;in proportion to the shares they had taken of the deceased’s property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Lau) of Obligations.—</span><span class="font1">The jurists of the classical period attribute obligation either to contract, or delict, or&nbsp;miscellaneous causes </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(variae causarum figurad)</span><span class="font1">; and those&nbsp;arising from contract fill a place in the later jurisprudence&nbsp;vastly greater than those arising from delict. In the&nbsp;XII. Tables it was very different. In them delicts were&nbsp;much more prominent than contracts,—wrongs entitling&nbsp;the sufferer to demand the imposition of penalties upon&nbsp;the wrongdoer that in most cases covered both reparation&nbsp;and punishment. The disproportion in the formulated&nbsp;provisions in reference to the two sources of obligation,&nbsp;however, is not surprising. For, first of all, the purpose&nbsp;of the decemviral code was to remove uncertainties and&nbsp;leave as little as possible to the arbitrariness of the magistrates. In nothing was there more scope for this than in&nbsp;the imposition of penalties; and, as different offences required to be differently treated, the provisions in reference&nbsp;to them were necessarily multiplied. In the next place,&nbsp;the intercourse that evokes contract was as yet very limited.&nbsp;Agriculture was the occupation of the great majority;&nbsp;trade and commerce were more backward than in the later&nbsp;years of the regal period ; coined money was just beginning&nbsp;to be used as a circulating medium. Lastly, the safeguards&nbsp;of engagement then lay to a great extent in the sworn oath&nbsp;or the plighted faith, of which the law had hardly begun&nbsp;to take cognizance, but which found a protection quite as&nbsp;potent in the religious and moral sentiments that had so</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">firm a hold on the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It may be asked—If a man purchased sheep or store cattle, a plough, a toga, a jar of wine or oil, had he no action to compel&nbsp;delivery, the vendor no action for payment of the price ?
