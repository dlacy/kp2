<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">upon which are developed, as lateral buds, moss-plants consisting of stem and leaves and bearing the sexual&nbsp;reproductive organs. Similarly, when the oospore has&nbsp;been formed by fertilization in the archegonium, it does&nbsp;not give rise to the sexual moss-plant, but to the asexual&nbsp;sporogonium. There is thus in the life-history of a Moss&nbsp;a regular alternation of a sexual with an asexual generation ; the former may be conveniently termed the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">oophore,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the latter the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sporophore·,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> the asexually produced spore&nbsp;always gives rise to the oophore (moss-plant), the sexually&nbsp;produced spore (oospore) of the moss-plant always gives&nbsp;rise to the sporophore (sporogonium).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">This kind of life-history is not peculiar to the Muscinere, but it can be traced, more or less clearly, in all the&nbsp;vascular plants (Pteridophyta, Phanerogams). In the&nbsp;Isosporous Vascular plants, those, namely, which produced&nbsp;spores of one kind only (Filices, Equisetacem, Lycopo-diacese), the asexually produced spore gives rise, on&nbsp;germination, to a small inconspicuous organism consisting&nbsp;entirely of cellular tissue, termed the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">prothallium</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, on&nbsp;which the sexual reproductive organs, the antheridia and&nbsp;arcliegonia, are borne; the oospore produced by fertilization in the archegonium gives rise to the well-developed&nbsp;plant, consisting of stem, root, and leaves, which produces&nbsp;the sporangia and spores. The prothallium, derived from&nbsp;the asexually produced spore, is clearly the sexual generation or oophore; the fully-developed plant derived from&nbsp;the sexually produced spore is the asexual generation or&nbsp;sporophore. In the Heterosporous Vascular plants, those,&nbsp;namely, which produce spores of two kinds (Rliizocarpae,&nbsp;Ligulatse, Phanerogams), the spores likewise give rise to&nbsp;prothallia, though they may be rudimentary. The microspore gives rise to a prothallium which is reduced to a&nbsp;single antheridium, and which, with the exception of&nbsp;Salvinia among the Rhizocarps, and of the Phanerogams,&nbsp;does not project from the spore; in Salvinia and in the&nbsp;Phanerogams it projects from the spore in the form of a&nbsp;closed tube, which is known in the Phanerogams as the&nbsp;pollen-tube. Similarly the macrospore of these plants&nbsp;gives rise to a small cellular prothallium bearing one or&nbsp;more archegonia, which in the Rhizocarps extends beyond&nbsp;the limits of the spore, but does not become free from it;&nbsp;in the Ligulatae (Selaginella and Isoetes) the prothallium&nbsp;is only partially exposed by the rupture of the coats of&nbsp;the spore, and in the Phanerogams, w<sup>7</sup>here it is termed the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">endosperm,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> it remains permanently and completely enclosed&nbsp;within the spore (embryo-sac). In the Heterosporous&nbsp;Vascular plants, then, as in the Isosporous, the asexual&nbsp;generation or sporophore is that which is termed the plant,&nbsp;which is highly differentiated morphologically and histologically, and which produces the sporangia and the spores;&nbsp;the sexual generation or oophore is here represented by&nbsp;two prothallia, the one exclusively male, the other exclusively female, derived respectively from the microspores&nbsp;and the macrospores.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Such a life-history can be stated generally in the following manner:—twice in its course the individual consists of a single cell, the spore, which in the one case has been&nbsp;produced asexually, in the other sexually; the sexual&nbsp;generation (oophore) springs from the asexually produced&nbsp;spore, and gives rise to the sexually produced spore&nbsp;(oospore) from which the asexual generation (sporophore)&nbsp;is developed. It is of interest to note that in most&nbsp;cases the organism developed from the sexually produced&nbsp;spore is much more highly organized than that developed&nbsp;from the asexually produced spore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A peculiarity of the macrospores of the Phanerogams is worthy of mention here, as it leads to the production of that structure, the&nbsp;seed, which is characteristic of Phanerogams; the production of&nbsp;a seed constitutes, in fact, the only real and constant distinction&nbsp;between Phanerogams and Cryptogams.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">As a rule the asexually produced spores of plants become free from the sporangium in which they have been formed. In&nbsp;Phanerogams this is true only of the microspores (pollen-grains),&nbsp;the macrospores (embryo-sacs) remaining permanently enclosed in&nbsp;the sporangia (mucellus) producing them. This being the case,&nbsp;their germination, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> the formation of endosperm, must take place&nbsp;within them whilst enclosed in the sporangium ; and, further, the&nbsp;formation of the female reproductive organs and the development&nbsp;of the embryo must take place under these circumstances also.&nbsp;The result is the production of a seed. In a typical seed three&nbsp;generations of the plant are represented ; they are as follows :—&nbsp;sporangial tissue belonging to the parent sporophore = perisperm ;&nbsp;tissue belonging to the oophore&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= endosperm ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">the new sporophore &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= embryo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">In the seed the development of the new asexual plant proceeds to a certain limit. When this is reached the development ceases,&nbsp;and it is only when the seed is placed under favourable conditions&nbsp;that the further development of the embryo, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> the germination&nbsp;of the seed, can take place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">It lias now been sliown that in the life-history of the. Muscineæ and in plants above them in the vegetable<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>kingdom there is a regular alternation of generations, and '&nbsp;the question now arises as to how far this is true of the !&nbsp;life-history of plants lower than the Mosses, that is, in the&nbsp;Thallophytes. It is clear that no such alternation can take&nbsp;place in the life-history of those which are known to&nbsp;reproduce only either sexually or asexually, nor in that of&nbsp;those individuals which produce spores both sexually and&nbsp;asexually, either simultaneously or at different times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The following are instances of the above-mentioned possible cases :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Thallophytes reproduced only by asexually produced spores </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">:— </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Algæ :</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Cyanophyceæ or Phycochromaceæ ; Protococcaceæ ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Spliacelariæ and Laminarieæ so far as known at present. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fungi :</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Schizomycetes ; Saccharomycetes ; Myxomycètes ;&nbsp;some Chvtridieæ ; probably many Mucorini ; a few&nbsp;Peronosporeæ (probably </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fhytophthora infestans</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pythium intermedium)</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> ; some Ascomycetes and Ure-dineæ ; Basidiomycetes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Thallophytes reproduced only by sexually produced spores </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Algæ:</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Conjugatæ ; Fucaceæ ; Sphæropleæ. The case of the Characeæ will be subsequently discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fungi</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> : a few Peronosporeæ (</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pythium vexans,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Artotrogus) ; </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ancylistes Closterii ; Aplanes Braunii</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">among the Sapro-legnieæ ; some Ascomycetes, Eremascus, Sordaria&nbsp;(Hypocopra), </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ascobolusfurfuraceus, Pyronema confluens,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Gymnoascus, Collemaceæ and other Lichen-Fungi ;&nbsp;some Uredineæ in which only æcidiospores are known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Thallophytes in which the same form produces spores both asexually and sexually </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Algæ :</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Vaucheria, Hydrodictyon, Ulothrix, Œdogonium, some Florideæ </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(e.g., Polysiphonia xariegata).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fungi</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> : Mucorini ; most Peronosporeæ and Saprolegnieæ ; Monoblepharis ; among the Ascomycetes, the Erysi-plieæ, Eurotium, Pénicillium, Nectria ; some Uredineæ&nbsp;( </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Uromyces appendiculatus, U. Bchenis, U. Scrophulariæ,&nbsp;U. Cestri, Puccinia Berberidis).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In some of the Algæ, as in the Volvocineæ, in the life-history of which distinct sexual and asexual forms occur, no alternation of generations can be traced, since there is no&nbsp;certainty as to the nature of the form arising from any&nbsp;given spore ; the form developed from the asexually produced spore is not, as in the typical life-history of the&nbsp;!Mess, necessarily sexual, nor is the individual produced&nbsp;from the sexually produced spore necessarily asexual. But&nbsp;in the life-history of some others an alternation of generations is traceable. Thus in the Siphonaceous Acetabularia&nbsp;the plant produces spores; these, as mentioned above,&nbsp;behave on germination as gametangia ; the gametes conjugate to form a zygospore, and from the zygospore the&nbsp;asexual Acetabularia springs. Here there is a distinct&nbsp;and regular alternation of generations ; the Acetabularia-plant is the asexual generation (sporophore), the gametangia alone representing the sexual generation (oophore).&nbsp;The life-history of Botrydium, another Siphonaceous Alga,&nbsp;is essentially the same as that of Acetabularia, but it is&nbsp;frequently less regular ; thus the resting-spores, instead of&nbsp;producing gametes, may directly germinate to form a</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
