Many of theſe are to be ſeen in the publications of the Academies of Stockholm, Upſal, Copenhagen, and ſome have been erected in this kingdom ; but they have not been found to anſwer.</p><p>We apprehend that they cannot anſwer. To dry malt, and make it fit for the ales and beers for which this iſland is ſo famous, it is by no means enough that we give it a proper and an equable ſupply of heat.— Tlιis alone would bake it and make it flinty, cauſing the moiſture to penetrate the mealy particles of the grain ; and, by completely diſſolving the ſoluble parts, would render each kernel an uniform maſs, which would dry into a flinty grain, breaking like a piece of glaſs. — A grain of malt is not an inert pulp. It is a <hi rend="smallcaps">seed,</hi> in an active ſtate, growing, and of an organized ſtructure. We with to ſtop it in this ſtate, and kill it, not by heating it, but by abſtracting its moiſture. We thus leave it in its granulated or organized form, ſpungy, and fit for imbibing water in the maſh tub, without running into a paſte.</p><p>To accompliſh theſe purpoſes, the conſtruction of our malt kilns ſeems very well adapted. The kiln is the only flue of the furnace, and a copious <hi rend="italic">current of air is </hi>formed through among the grains, carrying off with it the water which is evaporating by the beat. But this evaporation, being chiefly in conſequence of the vapour being immediately diſſolved by the paſſing air, will ſtop as ſoon as the current of air ſtops. This current has to make its way through moiſt grain, laid in a pretty thick bed, and matted together. Some force, therefore, is neceſſary to drive it through. This is furniſhed by the draught of the kiln. Subſtituting a ſtove, immediately applied to the malt, will not have this effect. The only way in which we think this can be done different from the preſent, is to have a horizontal flue, as has been propoſed in theſe projects, ſpread out at a ſmall diſtance below the grate on which the malt is laid, and to cover the whole with a high dome, like a glaſs houſe dome. This being filled with a tall column of hot air, and having no paſſage into it but through the malt, would produce the current which we want. We are convinced that this will make much leſs fuel ſerve ; but we are by no means certain that the ſulphureous and carbonic acid which accompanies the air in our common kiln is not a neceſſary or a uſeful ingredient in the proceſs. It is well known that different coaks, cinders, or chai coals, impart different qualities to the malts, and are preferred <hi rend="italic">each for its own purpoſe.</hi> Were this a matter of indifference, we know a method of rapidly drying malt much more economical and expeditious than by either kiln or ſtove. But this has nothing to do with our preſent ſubject, of which we now take leave.</p><p>STOURBRIDGE, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sturbich,</hi> the name of a field near Cambridge, noted for its famous <hi rend="italic">fair</hi> kept annually on the 7th of September, and which continues for a fortnight.

Lat. 51. 54. It is alſo the name of a fine ſeat of the Marquis of Buckingham in Buckinghamſhire. Here are the best gardens in England, adorned with buffs, ſtatues, obeliſks, pavilions, and temples. It is two miles from the town of Buckingham.</p><p>STOW (John), the induſtrious historian, ſon of Thomas Stow merchant-taylor of St Michael’s, Cornhill, in London, was born about the year 1525. Of the early part of his life we know very little, except that he was bred to his father’s buſineſs, which in the year 1560 he relinquiſhed, devoting himſelf entirely to the study of our ancient historians, chronicles, annals, charters, registers, and records. Of theſe he made a conſiderable collection, travelling for that purpoſe to different parts of the kingdom, and tranſcribing ſuch manuſcrips as he could not purchaſe. But this profeſſion of an antiquary being attended with no preſent emolument, he was obliged for ſubſistence to return to his trade.— It happened, however, that his talents and neceſſities were made known to Dr Parker archbishop of Canterbury ; who being himſelf an antiquary, encouraged and enabled Mr Stow to proſecute his darling ſtudy. In thoſe times of perſecution, though Elizabeth was then upon the throne, honest John Stow did not eſcape danger. His collection of Popiſh records was deemed cauſe of ſuſpicion. His younger brother Thomas preferred no leſs than 140 articles againſt him before the ecclesiaſtical commiſſion ; but the proof being inſufficient, he was acquitted. In 1565 he firſt. publiſhed his Summary oſ the Chronicles of England. About the year 1584 he began his Survey of London. In 1585 he was one of the two collectors for a great muſter of Limeſtreet ward : in the ſame year he petitioned the corporation of London to beſtow on him the benefit of two freemen, to enable him to publiſh his survey ; and in 1589 he petitioned again for a penſion. Whether he ſucceeded, is not known. He was principally concerned in the ſecond edition of Holinſhed’s chronicle, publiſhed in 1587. He alſo corrected, and twice augmented, Chaucer’s works, publiſhed in 1561 and in 1597. His ſurvey of London was firſt publiſhed in 1598. To theſe laborious works he would have added his large Chronicle, or History of England ; but he lived only to publiſh an abſtract of it, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Flores Historiarum.</hi> The folio volume, which was printed after his death, with the title of <hi rend="italic">Stow's Chronicle,</hi> was taken from his papers by Edmund Howes. Having thus ſpent his life and fortune in theſe laborious purſuits, he was at laſt obliged to ſolicit the charitable and well diſpoſed for relief. For this purpoſe, king James I. granted him, in 1603, a brief, which was renewed in 1604, authorising him to collect in churches the benefactions of his fellow-citizens. He died in April 1605, aged 80 ; and was buried in his pariſh-church of St Andrew's, Underſhaft, where his widow erected a decent monument to his memory. John Stow was a moſt indefatigable antiquarian, a faithful historian, and an honeſt man.</p><p>STOWMARKET, a town of Suffolk, in England, ſituated in E. Long. 1. 6. N.
