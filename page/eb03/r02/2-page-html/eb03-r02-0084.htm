<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">IhvEB∙Water.</span><span class="font0"> This is generally much ſofter and better accommodated to economical purpoſes than&nbsp;ſpring-water. For though rivers proceed originally&nbsp;from ſprings, yet, by their rapid motion, and by being&nbsp;expoſed during a long courſe to the influence of the ſun&nbsp;and air, the earthy and metallic ſalts which they contain&nbsp;are decompoſed, the acid flies off, and the terreſtrial&nbsp;parts precipitate to the bottom. Rivers are alſo rendered ſofter by the vaſt quantity of rain-water, which,&nbsp;paſſing along the ſurface of the earth, is conveyed into&nbsp;their channels. But all rivers carry with them a great&nbsp;deal of mud and other impurities; and, when they flow&nbsp;near large and populous towns, they become impregnated with a number of heterogeneous fubſtances, in which&nbsp;ſtate the water is certainly unfit for the purpoſes of life;&nbsp;yet, by remaining for ſome time at reſt, all the feculen-cicsfubſide, and the water becomes ſufficiently pure and&nbsp;potable.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RIVINIA, in botany : A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the tetfandria claſs of plants.—The&nbsp;perianth is four-leaved, coloured, and permanent, the&nbsp;leaflet oblong-egged and obtuſe ; there is no corolla, unleſs the calyx be conſidered as ſuch. There are four or&nbsp;eight filaments, ſhorter than the calyx, approaching by&nbsp;pairs, permanent ; the anthers are ſmall. The germ is&nbsp;large and roundiſh ; the ſtyle very ſhort ; the ſtigma&nbsp;ſimple and obtuſe. The berry is globular, fitting on&nbsp;the green reflected calyx, one-celled with an incurved&nbsp;point. There is one ſeed, lensform and rugged. This&nbsp;plant is called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Solenoides</span><span class="font0"> by Tournefort, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Piercea</span><span class="font0"> by&nbsp;Miller. It grows naturally in moſt of the iſlands of the&nbsp;Weft Indies. The juice of the berries of the plant wall&nbsp;ftain paper and linen of a bright red colour, and many&nbsp;experiments made with it to colour flowers have ſuc-ceeded extremely well in the following manner : the&nbsp;juice of the berries was preſſed out, and mixed with&nbsp;common water, putting it into a phial, ſhaking it well&nbsp;together for ſome time, till the water was thoroughly&nbsp;tinged ; then the flowers, which were white and juſt&nbsp;fully blown, were cut off, and their ſtalks placed into&nbsp;the phial ; and in one night the flowers have been finely&nbsp;variegated with red ; the flowers on which the experiments were made were the tuberoſe, and the double&nbsp;’white narciſſus.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROAD, an open way, or public paſſage, forming a communication between one place and another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of all the people in the world the Romans took the moſt pains in forming roads ; and the labour and ex-pences they were at in rendering them ſpacious, firm,&nbsp;ſtraight, and ſmooth, are incredible. They uſually&nbsp;ſtrengthened the ground by ramming it, laying it with&nbsp;flints, pebbles, or ſands, and ſometimes with a lining&nbsp;of maſonry, rubbiſh, bricks, &amp;c. bound together with&nbsp;mortar. In ſome places in the Lionoîs, F. Meneſtrier&nbsp;obſerves, that he has found huge cluſters of flints cemented with lime, reaching io or 12 ſeet deep, and&nbsp;making a maſs as hard and compact as marble ; and&nbsp;which, after rtſiſting the injuries of time for 1600&nbsp;years, is ſtill ſcarce penetrable by all the force of hammers, mattocks, &amp;c. and yet the flints it conſiſts of are&nbsp;not bigger than eggs. The moſt noble of the Roman&nbsp;roads was the λζia Appia, which was carried to ſuch a</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">vaſt length, that Procopius reckons it five days journey to the end of it, and Leipſius computes it at 350 miles;&nbsp;it is 12 ſeet broad, and made of ſquare ſree-ſtone generally a foot and a half on each ſide ; and though this&nbsp;has laſted for above 1800 years, yet in many places it&nbsp;is for ſeveral miles together as entire as when it was firſt&nbsp;made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ancient roads are diſtinguiſhed into military roads, double roads, ſubterraneous roads, &amp;c. The&nbsp;military roads were grand roads, formed by the Romans for marching their armies into the provinces of&nbsp;the empire ; the principal of theſe Roman roads in&nbsp;England are Watling-ſtreet, Tkenild-ſtreet, Foſs-way,&nbsp;and Erminage-ſtreet. Double roads among the Romans, were roads for carriages, with two pavements,&nbsp;the one for thoſe going one way, and the other for&nbsp;thoſe returning the other : theſe were ſeparated from&nbsp;each other by a cauſeway raiſed in the middle, paved&nbsp;with bricks, for the conveniency of foot paſſengers ;&nbsp;with borders and mounting ſtones from ſpace to ſpace,&nbsp;and military columns to mark the diſtance. Subterraneous roads are thoſe dug through a rock, and left&nbsp;vaulted ; as that of Puzzuoli near Naples, which is near&nbsp;half a league long, and is 15 feet broad and as many&nbsp;high.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The firſt law enacted reſpecting highways and roads in England was in the year 1285 ; when the lords of&nbsp;the ſoil were enjoined to enlarge thoſe </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ways</span><span class="font0"> where buſh-es, woods, or ditches be, in order to prevent robberies.&nbsp;The next law was made by Edward III. in the year&nbsp;1346 ; when a commiſſion was granted by the king to&nbsp;lay a toll on all ſorts of carriages paſſing from the hoſ-pital of St Giles in the fields to the bar of the Old&nbsp;Temple, and alſo through another highway called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Port-pool</span><span class="font0"> (now Gray’s Inn Lane) joined to the before-named&nbsp;highway ; which roads were become almoſt impaſſable.&nbsp;Little further relating to this ſubject occurs, till the&nbsp;reign of Henry VIII. when the pariſhes were entruſt-ed with the care of the roads, and ſurveyors were annually elected to take care of them. But the increaſe of&nbsp;luxury and commerce introduced ſuch a number of&nbsp;heavy carriages for the conveyance of goods, and&nbsp;lighter ones for the convenience and eaſe of travelling,&nbsp;that pariſh aid was found inſufficient to keep the beſt&nbsp;frequented roads in repair. This introduced toll-gates&nbsp;or turnpikes ; that ſomething might be paid towards&nbsp;their ſupport by every individual who enjoyed the benefit ol theſe improvements, by paſſing over the roads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Speaking of roads, the Abbé Raynal juſtly remarks. “ Let us travel over all the countries of the earth, and&nbsp;wherever we ſhall find no facility of trading from a city&nbsp;to a town, and from a village to a hamlet, we may pronounce the people to be barbarians ; and we ſhall only&nbsp;be deceived reſpecting the degree of barbariſm.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Road, in navigation, a bay, or place of anchorage, at ſome diſtance from the ſhore, whither ſhips or veſſels occaſionally repair to receive intelligence,&nbsp;orders, or neceſſary ſupplies ; or to wait for a fair&nbsp;wind, &amp;c. The excellence of a road conſiſts chiefly&nbsp;in its being protected from the reigning winds and&nbsp;the ſwell of the ſea ; in having a good anchoring-ground, and being at a competent diſtance from the&nbsp;ſhore. Thoſe which are not ſufficiently incloſed are&nbsp;termed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">open roads.</span></p>
