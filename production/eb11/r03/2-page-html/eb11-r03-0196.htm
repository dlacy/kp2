<p><span class="font1">The total of legionaries may be put at about 180,000 men, the auxiliaries at about 200,000. If wc exclude the “ household ” troops at Rome, the police fleets on the Mediterranean,&nbsp;and the local militia in some districts, we may put the regular&nbsp;army of the Empire at about 400,000 men. This army, as will&nbsp;be plain, was framed on much the same ideas as the British&nbsp;army of the 19th century. It was meant not to fight against&nbsp;a first-class foreign power, but to keep the peace and guard the&nbsp;frontiers of dominions threatened by scattered barbarian raids&nbsp;and risings. Field army there was none, nor any need. If&nbsp;special danger threatened or some special area was to be conquered—such as southern Britain </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 43) or a little land across&nbsp;the upper Rhine </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 74)—detachments </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Vexillationes)</span><span class="font1"> were&nbsp;sent by legions and sometimes also by auxiliaries in adjacent&nbsp;provinces, and a field force was formed sufficient for the moment&nbsp;and the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Change from the Third Period to the Fourth.—</span><span class="font1">Two principal causes brought gradual change to the Augustan army. In the&nbsp;first place, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pax Romana</span><span class="font1"> brought such prosperity to many&nbsp;districts that they ceased to provide sufficient recruits. The&nbsp;Romans, like the British in India, had more and more to look&nbsp;to uncivilized regions and even beyond their borders. Hence&nbsp;comes, in the 2nd century and after, a new class of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">numeri</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cunei</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vexillationes</span><span class="font1"> who used (like the earlier auxiliaries) their&nbsp;national arms and tactics and imported into the army a more&nbsp;and more non-Roman element. This tendency became very&nbsp;marked in the 3rd century and bore serious fruit at its close.&nbsp;And, secondly, the old days of mere frontier defence were over.&nbsp;The barbarians began to beat on the walls of the Empire as&nbsp;early as </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 160: about </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 250 they here and there got&nbsp;through, and they came henceforward in ever-growing numbers.&nbsp;Moreover, they came on horseback, bringing new tactics for the&nbsp;Roman infantry to face, and they came in huge masses. We&nbsp;may doubt if any military system could have permanently&nbsp;stayed this astonishing torrent. But the Empire did what it&nbsp;could. It enlisted barbarians to fight barbarians, and added&nbsp;freely—too freely, perhaps, if there was any choice—to the non-Roman elements of the army. It increased its cavalry and&nbsp;began to form a distinct field force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fourth Period.—</span><span class="font1">The results are seen in the reforms of Bio-cletian and Constantine the Great </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 284-cïrca 320). New frontier guards, styled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Iimitanei</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">riparienses,</span><span class="font1"> -were established,&nbsp;and the old army was reorganized in field forces which accompanied or might accompany the emperors in war </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(comiiatenses,&nbsp;palatini).</span><span class="font1"> The importance of the legions dwindled; the chief&nbsp;soldiers were the mercenaries, mostly Germans, enlisted from&nbsp;among the barbarians. New titles now appear, and it becomes&nbsp;plain even to the casual reader that in many points the new&nbsp;order is not the old. The details of the system are as complicated as all the administrative machinery of that age. Here it&nbsp;is enought to point out that the significance of such officers and&nbsp;titles as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dux</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comes</span><span class="font1"> (duke, count) lies ahead in the&nbsp;history of the middle ages, and not in the past, the history of&nbsp;the Roman army itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">War Office, General Staff.—</span><span class="font1">Under the Republic we do not find, and indeed should not expect to find, any central body&nbsp;which was especially entrusted with the development ' of the&nbsp;army system or military finance or military policy in wars.&nbsp;Even under the Empire, however, there was no such organization. The emperor, as commander-in-chief, and his more or&nbsp;less unofficial advisers doubtless decided questions of policy.&nbsp;But the army was so much a group of provincial armies that&nbsp;much was left to the chief officers in each province. Here,&nbsp;as elsewhere in the Empire, we trace a love if not for Home&nbsp;Rule, at least for Devolution. There was, however, a central&nbsp;finance office in Rome for the special purpose of meeting the&nbsp;bounties (or equivalent) due to discharged soldiers. This was&nbsp;established by Augustus in </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 6 with the title </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">aerarium&nbsp;militare,</span><span class="font1"> and had, for receipts, the yield of two taxes, a 5%&nbsp;legacy duty and a 1% on sales (or perhaps only on auction-sales). The legacy duty did not touch legacies to near relations&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font1">legacies of small amount.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROMAN ART. (1) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Introductory: History of Recent Research. </span><span class="font1">—The scientific study of ancient Roman art dates from a comparatively recent period. The great artists of the Renaissance,&nbsp;headed by Raphael and Michelangelo, showed no lack of appreciation for such models as the bas-reliefs of Trajan’s Column;&nbsp;and it is sufficient to name Mantegna’s “ Triumph of Caesar ”&nbsp;in order to recall the influence exerted by Roman historical&nbsp;sculpture upon their choice and treatment of monumental&nbsp;•subjects; but their eyes were fixed on the Greek ideal, however&nbsp;imperfectly represented by monuments then accessible, and&nbsp;the supremacy of this standard became established beyond&nbsp;challenge. In the 18th century Winckelmann, the founder&nbsp;of the science of classical archaeology, directed the gaze of&nbsp;students and critics towards the glories of classical Greek art,&nbsp;which he divined behind the copies which filled the palaces&nbsp;and museums of modern Rome;@@<sup>1</sup> and the rediscovery of the&nbsp;extant remains of that art, which began early in the 19th&nbsp;century and still continues, has naturally absorbed the attention&nbsp;of the great majority of classical archaeologists. Nevertheless, towards the close of the 19th century, when the main&nbsp;lines of Greek artistic development had been firmly traced&nbsp;and interest was aroused in its later offshoots, critics were led&nbsp;to examine more closely the products of the Roman period.&nbsp;As early as 1874 Philippi had published a study of Roman&nbsp;triumphal reliefs;@@<sup>2</sup> but his intention was to show that they&nbsp;were derived from the paintings exhibited on the occasion of&nbsp;a triumph—a theory which can no longer be maintained—&nbsp;and not to determine their place in the history of art. In&nbsp;1893, however, Alois Riegl published a series of essays on the&nbsp;history of ornament under the title of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Stilfragen,</span><span class="font1"> in one of&nbsp;which he expressed the opinion that “ there was in the antique&nbsp;art of the Roman Empire a development along the ascending&nbsp;line and not merely a decadence, as is universally believed.”&nbsp;This thesis was taken up two years later by Franz Wickhoff&nbsp;in a preface contributed to the reproduction in facsimile of&nbsp;the illustrated MS. of Genesis in the imperial library at Vienna.&nbsp;Wickhoff contended that, whilst the art of the Augustan period&nbsp;was the culmination of that which had flourished under the&nbsp;Hellenistic monarchies, it was succeeded by an outburst of&nbsp;genuinely Roman artistic effort, which reached the height of&nbsp;its achievement in the reliefs and portrait-sculpture of the&nbsp;Flavian period, and gave birth in the 2nd century </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> to the&nbsp;monuments of the “ continuous ” style of representation exemplified by the imperial columns. WickhofFs work has&nbsp;become familiar to English readers through Mrs Strong’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">@@@1The eleventh book of Winckelmann’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geschichte der Kunst, </span><span class="font1">which deals with art under the Romans, contains notable proofs&nbsp;of the author’s sureness of vision; for example, he divined the&nbsp;true date and affinities of the reliefs in the Villa Borghese, afterwards wrongly attributed to the time of Claudius (see below).</span></p>
