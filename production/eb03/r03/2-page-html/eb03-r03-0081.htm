<p><span class="font0">St Jerome, ſuppoſing that -Ruſinus would immediately proceed to Jeruſalem, wrote to one of his friends there, congratulating him on the proſpect of ſo illuſtrious a viſitor. To Jeruſalem he went, and having built&nbsp;a monaſtery on the Mount of Olives, he there aſſembled a great number of hermits, whom he animated to&nbsp;virtue by his exhortations. He converted many to the&nbsp;Chriſtian faith, and perſuaded more than 400 hermits&nbsp;who had taken part in the ſchiſm of Antioch to return&nbsp;to the church. He prevailed on many Macedonians&nbsp;and Arians to renounce their errors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His attachment to the opinions of Origen ſet him </span><span class="font1">at </span><span class="font0">variance with St Jerome, who, being of a temper peculiarly irritable, not only retracted all the praiſes which&nbsp;he had laviſhed upon him, but loaded him with ſevere&nbsp;reproaches. Their diſputes, which were carried to a&nbsp;very indecent height, tended to injure Chriſtianity in&nbsp;the èyes of the weak. Theophilus, their mutual friend,&nbsp;fettled their differences ; but the reconciliation was of&nbsp;-ſhort continuance. Ruſinus having publiſhed a tranſlation of the principles of Origen at Rome, was ſum-ηιoned to appear before Pope Anaſtaſius. But he made&nbsp;a ſpecious apology for not appearing, and ſent a vindication of his work, in wſhich he attempted to prove&nbsp;that certain errors, of which Origen had been accuſed,&nbsp;were perfectly conſiſtent with the opinions of the orthodox. St Jerome attacked Ruſinus’s tranſlation. Rufi-nus compoſed an eloquent reply, in which lie declared&nbsp;•that he was only the tranſlator of Origen, and did not&nbsp;confider himſelf bound .to fonction all his errors. Moſt&nbsp;©ccleſiaſtical hiſtorians ſay that Ruſinus was excommunicated by Pope Anaſtaſius ; but for this no good evidence has been brought. In 407, he returned to&nbsp;Rome ; but the year aſter, that city being threatened by&nbsp;Alaric,.he retired to Sicily, where he died in 410.</span></p>
