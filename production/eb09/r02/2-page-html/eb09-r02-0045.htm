<p><span class="font0">It has been determined that 1 gramme of hæmoglobin can link to itself 1 -671 cc. of oxygen gas (at 0° C. and 760 mm. pressure)&nbsp;in the above-described loose manner,—that is, in such a manner&nbsp;that when admitted to a vacuous space at a moderate temperature&nbsp;the two become again dissociated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When blood or a solution of oxyhæmoglobin is shaken up with carbon monoxide, the “dissociable” or “respiratory” oxygen is&nbsp;displaced, and a new compound of CO and hæmoglobin is formed&nbsp;which has a spectrum very like that of oxyhæmoglobin, but is&nbsp;incapable of reduction by the means which are sufficient to reduce&nbsp;oxyhæmoglobin. In like manner (with certain precautions) a compound of hæmoglobin with NO may be formed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Various products of the destructive decomposition of hæmoglobin are known, possessing characteristic spectra and properties ; these&nbsp;need not be further described.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Proteid Substances.—</span><span class="font0">Besides oxyhæmoglobin, the red corpuscles contain other proteid substances, probably for the most part paraglobulin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lecithin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cholesterin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Inorganic Salts.—</span><span class="font0">Potassium and phosphates are the main constituent ; sodium, calcium, and magnesium are also found as chlorides and sulphates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gases.—,</span><span class="font0">See below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Constituents of the White Corpuscles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Proteid Substances.—</span><span class="font0">Several varieties have been separated.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Certain </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">extractives,</span><span class="font0"> including </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">glycogen.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Gases of the Blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The blood when admitted into a vacuous space readily gives up more than half its volume of mixed gases, consisting of oxygen,&nbsp;carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. The oxygen is present in much&nbsp;larger quantities than could be held in simple solution by the water&nbsp;of the blood ; it is in fact mainly held in feeble combination by the&nbsp;hæmoglobin of the coloured corpuscles ; only a trace of it is, under&nbsp;ordinary circumstances, held in true solution. The carbon dioxide,&nbsp;whilst not existing in larger quantity in blood than would be&nbsp;possible if it were simply dissolved by the water of that fluid, is</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">nevertheless to a small extent in a state of loose chemical combination in which both plasma and corpuscles share. The nitrogen is held in a state of simple solution in the liquor sanguinis. These&nbsp;gases are yielded in different proportions by arterial and venous&nbsp;blood, as is shown in the following table :—</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The method of extracting the gases of the blood which has been found to be most convenient is one in which the blood is introduced&nbsp;into the Torricellian vacuum existing above the column of mercury&nbsp;in a barometer. Blood is collected over mercury in such a way as&nbsp;to avoid all access of air ; it is then introduced by an appropriate&nbsp;mechanism into the space above the barometric mercury. Λt once&nbsp;the gases froth up and fill the space ; the aqueous vapour which at&nbsp;the same time arises is absorbed by a special drying apparatus communicating with the vacuum. Means exist of warming the vacuous space up to about 45° C., which is a temperature sufficient to&nbsp;cause the escape of nearly all the gases of the blood ; the last portions of carbonic acid are, however, more rapidly evolved by&nbsp;allowing a small volume of a thoroughly boiled-out solution of&nbsp;phosphoric acid to enter the blood receptacle near the close of the&nbsp;operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">How the Gaseous Exchanges are Effected in Respiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For the purposes of description, and in reference exclusively to its respiratory function, the blood may be&nbsp;looked upon as a watery solution of certain substances&nbsp;having respectively a slight chemical attraction for oxygen&nbsp;and for carbon dioxide. The chief of these substances is&nbsp;hæmoglobin, which is concerned solely with the oxygen ;&nbsp;others, less perfectly known, are concerned with the carbon&nbsp;dioxide, and include certain saline constituents of the&nbsp;plasma (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>)</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> and perhaps also certain constituents&nbsp;of the corpuscles. The affinity of these substances for&nbsp;oxygen and carbon dioxide respectively is of so slight a&nbsp;nature that the mere exposure of the substances to a&nbsp;vacuum at a certain moderate temperature is sufficient to&nbsp;overcome the affinity, and dissociate the captive gases.&nbsp;Granted such a solution in the blood-vessels of the lungs,&nbsp;separated from the air of the air cells by the thin moist&nbsp;membranes of the alveolar walls, how are the gaseous&nbsp;exchanges of respiration brought about? In the first place&nbsp;we must premise certain physical relationships which exist&nbsp;between gases and fluids in contact with one another. If&nbsp;a definite quantity of pure water be exposed to the air it&nbsp;will at a given temperature dissolve a definite volume of&nbsp;air. If the air be compressed to one-half (or one-quarter)&nbsp;of its original bulk the water will still absorb the same&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">volume</span><span class="font1"> of it, albeit that volume now contains twice (or&nbsp;four times) the former </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">quantity</span><span class="font1"> of gas. If the pressure be&nbsp;diminished again the air will escape from the water exactly&nbsp;in proportion to the diminished pressure. This is a concrete example of Dalton’s law that the quantity of a gas&nbsp;dissolved by a liquid varies directly as the pressure of the&nbsp;gas at the surface of the liquid. What is true of the air&nbsp;is true of its constituents. In the above example the&nbsp;quantity of the constituent oxygen absorbed after the&nbsp;compression of the air is twice (or four times) the quantity&nbsp;absorbed before compression. But the quantity which is&nbsp;absorbed of any constituent of a gaseous mixture depends,&nbsp;not upon the total pressure exerted on the liquid by all&nbsp;the gases of the mixture in contact with its surface, but by&nbsp;the partial pressure, or fraction of the total pressure,&nbsp;exerted by the constituent in question. To take an example, let us suppose that a solution of oxygen in water&nbsp;made at a certain definite pressure is exposed to an atmosphere of pure nitrogen exerting as great a pressure, or&nbsp;even a greater, on the surface of the liquid ; notwithstanding this pressure the oxygen would escape from solution&nbsp;as readily as if the solution had been placed in a perfectly&nbsp;vacuous space. If water be exposed in a certain space of&nbsp;air (which is, roughly, a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen),&nbsp;the oxygen which it is capable of absorbing would be</span></p>
