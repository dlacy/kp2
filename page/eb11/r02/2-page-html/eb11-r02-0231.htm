<p><span class="font1">heated in a current of chlorine, any iridium present being converted into its chloride by treatment .with nitric acid and&nbsp;precipitated by ammonium chloride, whilst rhodium ammonium&nbsp;chloride goes into solution with its characteristic rose-red&nbsp;colour (C. E. Claus, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jour. prakt.Chem.,</span><span class="font1"> 1843-1845). Forothcr&nbsp;methods of extraction see Gibbs, ib., 1861, 84, p. 65; 1865,&nbsp;94, p. 10; T. Wilm, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bull. soc. chim.,</span><span class="font1"> 1880 (2), 34, p. 679;&nbsp;E. Frémy, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Comptes rendus,</span><span class="font1"> 1854, 38, p. 1008, &amp;c.). The metal&nbsp;itself is best obtained by the reduction of chlorpurpureo&nbsp;rhodium chloride, (Cl<sub>2</sub>Rh<sub>2</sub>TONHa)-Cli, in a current of hydrogen,&nbsp;the metal after reduction being cooled in a stream of carbon&nbsp;dioxide (S. M. Jorgensen, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Zeit, anorg. Chem.,</span><span class="font1"> 1903, 34, p. 82).&nbsp;It somewhat resembles aluminium in colour ; its specific&nbsp;gravity varies from 11 to 12-1; and its specific heat is 0-05527&nbsp;(V. H. Regnault, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ann. chim. phys.,</span><span class="font1"> 1861, 63, p. 15). It is&nbsp;less fusible than platinum. It oxidizes superficially when&nbsp;heated, and may be distilled in the electric furnace. It is&nbsp;insoluble in acids, but forms a soluble sulphate when fused&nbsp;with potassium bisulphate (a reaction which distinguishes it&nbsp;from the other metals of the platinum group). It oxidizes&nbsp;when fused with potassium hydroxide and potassium nitrate,&nbsp;to the dioxide, RhO<sub>2</sub>. It absorbs hydrogen readily.. Rhodium&nbsp;black is obtained by reducing rhodium salts with formic acid;&nbsp;by alcohol in the presence of alkali; or by precipitation with&nbsp;zinc and iron. A colloidal rhodium may be prepared by&nbsp;reducing the Sesquichloride with hydrazine hydrate. Rhodium&nbsp;salts may be recognized by their characteristic reaction with&nbsp;freshly prepared sodium ' hypochlorite solution. A yellow&nbsp;precipitate is obtained, which on shaking for some time with&nbsp;acetic acid gradually dissolves to an orange-coloured solution.&nbsp;This solution after a short time deposits a grey precipitate,&nbsp;and the supernatant liquid becomes azure blue in colour (E.&nbsp;Demarçay, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Comptes rendus,</span><span class="font1"> 1885, ιοί, p. 951).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Several oxides of rhodium are known. The monoxide, RhO, formed when the hydrated sesquioxide is heated (Claus) or when&nbsp;finely divided rhodium is heated in a current of air (WiIm), is a grey&nbsp;powder which is insoluble in acids. The sesquioxide, Rh<sub>2</sub>Os, is a&nbsp;black insoluble powder, formed when the corresponding hydrate is&nbsp;heated. This hydrate, Rh<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>e</sub>, is obtained as a yellow powder,&nbsp;by decomposing rhodium salts(not the sulphate)with dilute solutions&nbsp;of the caustic alkalis. It is soluble in acids, and in the moist&nbsp;condition is also soluble in concentrated alkalis. A hydrated&nbsp;rhodium dioxide, RhO<sub>2</sub>-2H<sub>2</sub>O, is formed when chlorine is passed&nbsp;into a solution of the sesquioxide in concentrated caustic potash,&nbsp;or by adding an alkaline hypochlorite to a concentrated alkaline&nbsp;solution of rhodium and sodium chlorides.. It is a greenish-black&nbsp;powder which is soluble in hydrochloric acid. Rhodium chloride,&nbsp;Rh<sub>2</sub>CU, is obtained impure by heating the metal to dull redness in a&nbsp;current of chlorine, or, purer, by heating an alloy of rhodium and tin&nbsp;in chlorine or by heating the double ammonium rhodium chloride&nbsp;in chlorine at 440° C. (E. Leidié, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ann. chim. phys.,</span><span class="font0"> 1889, (6), 17,&nbsp;p. 265; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Comptes rendus,</span><span class="font0"> 1899, 129, p. 1249). It is a red powder,&nbsp;which decomposes at a red heat, leaving a residue of the metal. It&nbsp;is insoluble in water and acids, but dissolves in concentrated solutions of potassium cyanide. The hydrated form Rh<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>e</sub>-8H<sub>2</sub>O is&nbsp;obtained impure by dissolving the hydrated sesquioxide in hydrochloric acid, by the action of Jiydrofluosilicic acid on potassium&nbsp;rhodium chloride, and by the action of chlorine on rhodium in the&nbsp;presence of sodium chloride. In the last method the product is&nbsp;dissolved in a dilute hydrochloric acid (1:1), and the solution&nbsp;saturated with hydrochloric acid gas at o° C., allowed to stand for&nbsp;some time, decanted, and finally evaporated in vacuo (Leidié, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">toe. cit.).&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">It forms a very deliquescent, red, amorphous mass, which decomposes on exposure. It is very soluble in water, forming a yellow&nbsp;solution. It forms double salts with the alkaline chlorides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rhodium monosulphide, RhS, is formed when rhodium or rhodium ammonium chloride are heated with sulphur, and also by precipitating rhodium salts with sulphuretted hydrogen, the precipitate being&nbsp;dissolved in ammonium sulphide and thrown down again by dilute&nbsp;sulphuric acid (Lecoq de Boisbaudran, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ber.,</span><span class="font0"> 1883, 16, p. 579). It is a&nbsp;dark-coloured powder which is insoluble in acids and other solvents.&nbsp;It loses all its sulphur when heated in air. The sesquisulphide,&nbsp;Rh<sub>2</sub>S<sub>s</sub>, is prepared by heating anhydrous rhodium chloride, Rh<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>e</sub>,&nbsp;in a .current of sulphuretted hydrogen at 360° C., or by passing the&nbsp;gas into a boiling solution of the chloride. It is a black powder&nbsp;which is insoluble in acids and in alkaline sulphides. It decomposes&nbsp;when strongly heated. Rhodium sulphate, Rh<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>e</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, is prepared&nbsp;by oxidizing the sulphide, by fusing the metal with acid potassium&nbsp;sulphate, or by the action of concentrated sùlphuric acid on an alloy&nbsp;of rhodium, and lead, or on the hydrated sesquioxide. It is a red&nbsp;powder which decomposes when heated or when boiled with much</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">water. It forms alums (Leidié, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Comptes rendus,</span><span class="font0"> 1888, 107, p. 234)., Rhodium potassium alum, Rh<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>e</sub>)<sub>2</sub>-K<sub>2</sub>SO <sub>e</sub>-24H<sub>2</sub>O, is obtairtea by&nbsp;dissolving the sesquioxide in sulphuric acid and adding two-thirds&nbsp;of the calculated amount of potassium sulphate to the solution&nbsp;(A. Piccini and L. Marino, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">anorg. Chem.,</span><span class="font0"> 1001, 27, p. 62). It&nbsp;crystallizes in cubes. Rhodium cyanide, Rh<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>e</sub>, is.a carmine-red&nbsp;powder formed when rhodium potassium cyanide is boiled with&nbsp;acetic acid. Rhodium potassium cyanide, K<sub>e</sub>Rh<sub>2</sub>(CN)J<sub>2</sub>, is formed&nbsp;when the sesquioxide is dissolved in caustic potash and an excess of&nbsp;hydrocyanic acid added gradually, the solution being then evaporated&nbsp;in vacuo. It is a colourless crystalline solid soluble in Water<sub>l</sub> and&nbsp;isomorphous with the corresponding iron, cobalt, chromium and&nbsp;manganese compounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' ·</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The rhodium ammonia salts correspond almost with the similar cobalt compounds and may be divided into three series—namely,&nbsp;hexammine salts (luteo-salts), [Rh(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>e</sub>JX<sub>2</sub>; aquopentammine salts&nbsp;(roseo-salts), [Rh(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>e</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>OJX<sub>2</sub>; and pentammine salts (purpureo-salts), [Rh(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>e</sub>XJX<sub>2</sub>. (See S. F. Jorgensen, C. W. Blomstrand,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jour. prak. Chem.,</span><span class="font0"> 1882, et seq.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The atomic weight of rhodium has been determined by S. F. Jorgensen </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Jour, prakt. Chem.,</span><span class="font0"> 1883, 27, p. 486), by the analysis of&nbsp;chlorpurpureo rhodium chloride, the mean value obtained being&nbsp;103; whilst K. Seubcrt and K. Kobbé </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Ann.,</span><span class="font0"> 1890, 260, p. 314), by&nbsp;analysis of the double chloride and sulphate, obtained as a mean&nbsp;value 102-86.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHODOCHROSITE, a mineral species consisting of manganese carbonate, MnCO<sub>s</sub>, crystallizing in the rhombohedral system and isomorphous with calcite. It usually occurs&nbsp;as cleavable, compact or botryoidal masses, distinct crystals&nbsp;being somewhat rare; these often have the form ,of thé&nbsp;primitive rhombohedron, parallel to the faces of which there&nbsp;are perfect cleavages. When pure, the mineral contains&nbsp;47*7% of manganese, but this is usually partly replaced by&nbsp;varying amounts of iron, and sometimes -by calcium, magnesium, zinc, or rarely cobalt (cobalt-manganese-spar). With&nbsp;these variations in chemical composition the specific gravity&nbsp;varies from 3-45 to 3-60; the hardness is 4. The coloqr is&nbsp;usually rose-red, but may sometimes be grey to brown. The&nbsp;name rhodochrosite, from the Greek </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ρόδο-χρως</span><span class="font1"> (rose-coloured), has reference to the characteristic , colour of the&nbsp;mineral : manganese-spar and dialogite are synonyms. ‘ It&nbsp;is found in mineral veins with ores of silver, lead, copper,- &amp;c.,&nbsp;or in deposits of manganese ore. Crystals have beep met&nbsp;with in the mines at Kapnik-Banya and Nagyâg near :Déva&nbsp;in Transylvania and at Diez in Nassau, but by far the best&nbsp;specimens are from Colorado. The mineral is used to a limited&nbsp;extent in the manufacture of spiegeleisen and ferromanganese.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHODODENDRON, Classical writers, such as Dioscorides and Pliny,'seem, from what can.be ascertained, to have called&nbsp;the oleander </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Nerium Oleander)</span><span class="font1"> by this name, but in modem&nbsp;usage it is applied to a large genus of shrubs and trees be<sub>7&nbsp;</sub>longing to the order of heaths (Ericaceae). No adequate&nbsp;distinction can be drawn between this genus and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Azalea (q.v.)—&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the proposed marks of distinction, however applicable in&nbsp;particular cases, breaking down when tested more generally.&nbsp;The rhododendrons are trees or shrubs, never herbs, with&nbsp;simple, evergreen or deciduous leaves, and flowers in terminal&nbsp;clusters surrounded in the bud by bud-scales but not as a rule&nbsp;by true leaves. The flowers are remarkable for the frequent&nbsp;absence or reduced condition of the calyx. The funnel- or&nbsp;bell-shaped corolla, on the other hand, with its five or more&nbsp;lobes, is usually conspicuous, and in some species so much so&nbsp;as to render these plants greatly prized in gardens. The&nbsp;free stamens are usually ten, with slender filaments and anthers&nbsp;opening by pores at the top. The ovary is five-or many-celled, ripening into a long woody pod which splits from top&nbsp;to bottom by a number of valves, which break away from&nbsp;the central placenta and liberate a large number of small branlike seeds provided with a membranous wing-like appendage&nbsp;at each end. The species are for the most part native? of&nbsp;the mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere, extending as far south as the Malay Archipelago and New Guinea,&nbsp;but not hitherto found in South America or Australia. None&nbsp;are natives of Britain. They vary greatly in stature, some&nbsp;of the alpine species being mere pygmies with minute leaves&nbsp;and tiny blossoms, while some of the Himalayan species&nbsp;are moderate-sized trees with superb flowers.
