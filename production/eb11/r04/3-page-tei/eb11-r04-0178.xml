The French court, and indeed all French society, was just then much interested in literary questions, and a curious story is told of the rivalry that ensued. Mellin de Saint-Gelais, it is said, the chief of the “ École Marotique ” and a poet of no small merit, took up Ronsard’s book and read part of it in a more or less designedly burlesque fashion before the king. It may be observed that if he did so it was a distinctly rash and uncourtier-like act, inasmuch as, from Ronsard’s father’s position in the royal household, the poet was personally known and liked both by Henry and by his family. At any rate, Marguerite de Valois, the king’s sister, afterwards duchess of Savoy, is said to have snatched the book from Saint-Gelais and insisted on reading it herself, with the result of general applause. Henceforward, if not before, his acceptance as a poet was not doubtful, and indeed the tradition of his having to fight his way against cabals is almost entirely unsupported. His popularity in his own time was overwhelming and immediate, and his prosperity was unbroken. He published his <hi rend="italic">Hymns</hi>, dedicated to Marguerite dc Savoie, in 1555; the conclusion of the <hi rend="italic">Amours,</hi>  addressed to another heroine, in 1556; and then a collection of <hi rend="italic">Œuvres complètes,</hi>  said to be due to the invitation of Mary Stuart, queen of Francis II., in 1560; with <hi rend="italic">Elégies, mascarades et bergeries</hi>  in 1565. To this same year belongs his most important and interesting <hi rend="italic">Abrégé de l’art poétique français.</hi></p><p>The rapid change of sovereigns did Ronsard no harm. Charles IX., who succeeded his brother after a very short time, was even better inclined to him than Henry and Francis. He gave him rooms in the palace; he bestowed upon him divers abbacies and priories; and he called him and regarded him constantly as his master in poetry. Neither was Charles IX. a bad poet. This royal patronage, however, had its disagreeable side. It excited violent dislike to Ronsard on the part of the Huguenots, who wrote constant pasquinades against him, strove (by a ridiculous exaggeration of the Dionvsiac festival at Arcueil, in which the friends had indulged to celebrate the success of the first French tragedy, Jodelle’s <hi rend="italic">Cléopâtre)</hi>  to represent him as a libertine and an atheist, and (which seems to have annoyed him more than anything else) set up his follower Du Bart as as his rival. According to some words of his own, which are quite credible considering the ways of the time, they were not contented with this variety of argument, but attempted to have him assassinated. During this period Ronsard’s work was considerable but mostly occasional, and the one work of magnitude upon which Charles put him, the <hi rend="italic">Françiade</hi>  (1572), has never been ranked, even by his most devoted admirers, as a chief title to fame. The metre (the decasyllabic) which the king chose could not but contrast unfavourably with the magnificent alexandrines which Du Bartas and Agrippa d’Aubignê were shortly to produce; the general plan is feebly classical, and the very language has little or nothing of that racy mixture of scholarliness and love of natural beauty which distinguishes the best work of the Pléiade. The poem could never have had an abiding success, but at its appearance it had the singular bad luck almost to coincide with the massacre of St Bartholomew, which had occurred about a fortnight before its publication. One party in the state were certain to look coldly on the work of a minion of the court at such a juncture, the other had something else to think of. The death of Charles made, indeed, little difference in the court favouf which Ronsard enjoyed, but, combined with his increasing infirmities, it seems to have determined him to quit court life. During his last days he lived chiefly at a house which he possessed in Vendôme, the capital of his native province, at his abbey at Croix-Val in the same neighbourhood, or else at Paris, where he was usually the guest of Jean Galland, well known as a scholar, at the Collège de Boncourt. It seems also that he had a town house of his own in the Faubourg Saint-Marcel. At any rate his preferments made him in perfectly easy circumstances, and he seems neither to have derived nor wished for any profit from his books. A half-jocular suggestion that his publisher should give him money to buy “ du bois pour se chauffer ” in return for his last revision of his <hi rend="italic">Œuvres completes</hi>  is the only trace of any desire of the kind. On the other hand, he received not merely gifts and endowments from his own sovereign but presents from many others, including Elizabeth of England. Mary, queen of Scots, who had known him earlier, addressed him from her prison ; and Tasso consulted him on the <hi rend="italic">Gerusalemme. </hi>His last years were, however, saddened not merely by the death of many of his most intimate friends, but by constant and increasing ill-health. This did not interfere with his literary work in point of quality, for he was rarely idle, and some of his latest work is among his best. But he indulged (what few poets have wisely indulged) the temptation of constantly altering his work, and many of his later alterations are by no means for the better. Towards the end of 1585 his condition of health grew worse and worse, and he seems to have moved restlessly from one of his houses to another for some months. When the end came, which, though in great pain, he met in a resolute and religious manner, he was at his priory of Saint-Cosme at Tours, and he was buried in the church of that name on Friday, December 27.</p><p>The character and fortunes of Ronsard’s works, are among the most remarkable in literary history, and supply in themselves a kind of illustration of the progress of French literature during the last three centuries. It was long his fortune to be almost always extravagantly admired or violently attacked. At first, as has been said, the enmity, not altogether unprovoked, of the friends and followers of Marot fell to his lot, then the still fiercer antagonism of the Huguenot faction, who, happening to possess, a poet of great merit in Du Bartas, were able to attack Ronsard in his tenderest point. But fate had by no means done its worst with him in his lifetime. After his death the classical reaction set in under the auspices of Malherbe, who seems to have been animated with a sort of personal hatred of Ronsard, though it is not clear that they ever met. After Malherbe the rising glory of Corneille and his contemporaries obscured the tentative and unequal work of the Pléiade, which was, moreover, directly attacked by Boileau himself, the dictator of French criticism in the last half of the 17th century. Then Ronsard was, except by a few men of taste, like La Bruyère and Fénelon, forgotten when he was not sneered at. In this condition he remained during the whole 18th century and the first quarter of the 19th. The Romantic revival, seeing in him a victim of its special <hi rend="italic">bete noire</hi>  Boileau, and attracted by his splendid diction, rich metrical faculty, and combination of classical and medieval peculiarities, adopted his name as a kind of battle-cry, and for the moment exaggerated his merits somewhat. The critical work, however, first of Sainte-Beuve in his <hi rend="italic">Tableau de la littérature française au lôème siècle,</hi>  and since of others, has established Ronsard pretty securely in his right place, a place which may be defined in a few sentences.</p><p>For the general position of the Pléiade, see <hi rend="smallcaps">French Literature. </hi>Ronsard, its acknowledged chief and its most voluminous poet, was probably also its best, though a few isolated pieces of Belleau excel him in airy lightness of touch. Several sonnets of Du Bellay exhibit what may be called the intense and voluptuous melancholy of the Renaissance more perfectly than anything of his, and the finest passages of the <hi rend="italic">Tragiques</hi>  and the <hi rend="italic">Divine Sepmaine</hi>  surpass his work in command of the alexandrine and in power, of turning it to the purposes of satirical invective and descriptive narration. But that work is, as has been said, very extensive (we possess at a rough guess not much short of a hundred thousand lines of his), and it is extraordinarily varied in form. He did not introduce the sonnet into* France, but he practised it very soon after its introduction and with admirable skill—the famous “ Quand vous serez bien vieille ” being one of the acknowledged gems of French literature. His odes, which are very numerous, are also very interesting and in their best shape very perfect compositions. He began by imitating the strophic arrangement of the ancients, but very soon had the wisdom to desert this for a kind of adjustment of the Horatian ode to rhyme, instead of exact quantitative metre. In this latter kind he devised some exquisitely melodious rhythms of which, till our own day, the secret died with the 17th century. His more sustained work.sometimes displays a bad selection of measure; and his occasional poetry—epistles, eclogues, elegies, &amp;c.—is injured by its vast volume. But the preface to the <hi rend="italic">Françiade</hi>  is a very fine piece of verse, far superior (it is in alexandrines) to the poem itself. Generally speaking, Ronsard is best in his amatory verse (the long series of sonnets and odes to Cassandre, Marie, Genèvre, Hélène— Hélène de Surgères, a later and mainly “ literary ” love—&amp;c.), and in his. descriptions of the country (the famous “Mignonne allons voir si la rose,” the “ Fontaine Bellerie,” the “ Forêt de Gastine,” and so forth), which have an extraordinary grace and freshness. No one used with more art than he the graceful diminutives which</p><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
