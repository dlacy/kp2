<p><span class="font0">on 7th June 1307. By his dying wish the inscription “ Edwardus Primus, Scotorum Malleus, Pactum Serva&nbsp;was put on his tomb. In a moment all was changed.&nbsp;Instead of being opposed to the greatest, Bruce now had as&nbsp;his antagonist the feeblest of the Plantagenets. Quitting&nbsp;Rathlin (after a short stay in Arran), Bruce had before&nbsp;Edward’s death attempted to take Turnberry and Ayr,&nbsp;but had failed, though he defeated Pembroke at Loudoun&nbsp;Hill. No sooner was his father dead than Edward II.&nbsp;recalled his banished favourite Gaveston. After wasting&nbsp;the critical moment of the war in the diversions of a&nbsp;youthful court, the new king made an inglorious march&nbsp;to Cumnock and back without striking a blow, and then&nbsp;returned south to celebrate his marriage with Isabella of&nbsp;F rance, leaving the war to a succession of generals. Bruce,&nbsp;with the insight of military genius, seized his opportunity.&nbsp;Leaving Edward, now his only brother in blood and&nbsp;almost his equal in arms, in Galloway, he suddenly transferred his own operations to Aberdeenshire. In the end&nbsp;of 1307 and again in May 1308 he overran Buchan,&nbsp;where at Inverury on 22d May he defeated its earl, one&nbsp;of his chief Scottish opponents. Then crossing to Argyll&nbsp;he surprised Lord Lorn in the Pass of Brander and took&nbsp;Dunstaffnage. In 1309 a truce, scarcely kept, was effected&nbsp;by the pope and Philip of France, and in 1310, in a general&nbsp;council at Dundee, the clergy of Scotland—all the bishops&nbsp;being present—reoognized Bruce as king. The support&nbsp;given him by the national church in spite of his excommunication must have been of great importance in that&nbsp;age, and was probably due to the example of Lamberton.&nbsp;The next three years were signalized by the reduction one&nbsp;by one of the strong places the English still held,—Linlithgow in the end of 1310, Dumbarton in October 1311,&nbsp;Perth by Bruce himself in January 1312. Encouraged&nbsp;by these successes, he made a raid into the north of England,&nbsp;and on his return reduced Butel (in Galloway), Dumfries,&nbsp;and Dalswinton, and threatened Berwick. In March 1313&nbsp;Sir James Douglas surprised Roxburgh, and Randolph&nbsp;surprised Berwick. In May Bruce was again in England,&nbsp;and, though he failed to take Carlisle, he subdued the Isle&nbsp;of Man. Edward Bruce about the same time took Ruther-glen and laid siege to Stirling, whose governor, Mowbray,&nbsp;agreed to capitulate if not relieved before 24th June 1314.&nbsp;Bruce’s rapidity of movement was one cause of his success.&nbsp;His sieges, the most difficult part of mediaeval w<sup>τ</sup>arfare,&nbsp;though won sometimes by stratagem, prove that he and&nbsp;his followers had benefited from their early training in the&nbsp;wars of Edward I. We know that he had been specially&nbsp;employed by that king to prepare the siege-train for his&nbsp;attack on Stirling. By the close of 1313 Berwick and&nbsp;Stirling alone remained English. Edward II. felt that if&nbsp;Scotland was not to be lost a great effort must be made.&nbsp;With the whole available feudal levy of England, a contingent from Ireland, and recruits even out of jails—for&nbsp;murderers were pardoned on condition of joining the army&nbsp;—he advanced from Berwick to Falkirk, which, he reached&nbsp;on 22d June. After a preliminary skirmish on Sunday&nbsp;the 23d, in which Bruce distinguished himself by a personal combat with Henry de Bohun, whom he felled by&nbsp;a single blow of his axe, the battle of Bannockburn was&nbsp;fought on Monday the 24th ; and the complete rout of&nbsp;the English determined the independence of Scotland and&nbsp;confirmed the title of Bruce. The details of the day,&nbsp;memorable in the history of war as well as of Scotland,&nbsp;have been singularly well preserved, and redound to the&nbsp;credit of Bruce, who had studied in the school of Wallace&nbsp;as well as in that of Edward I. He had chosen and&nbsp;knew his ground,—the New Park between St Ninian’s&nbsp;and the Bannock, a petty burn, yet sufficient to produce&nbsp;marshes dangerous to heavily-armed horsemen, while from&nbsp;the rising ground on his right the enemy’s advance was&nbsp;seen. His troops were in four divisions ; his brother commanded the right, Randolph the centre, Douglas the left.&nbsp;Bruce with the reserve planted his standard at the Bore&nbsp;Stone, whence there is the best view of the field. His&nbsp;camp-followers on the Gillies’ Hill appeared over its crest&nbsp;at the critical moment which comes in all battles. The&nbsp;plain on the right of the marshes was prepared with pits&nbsp;and spikes. But what more than any other point of&nbsp;strategy made the fight famous was that the Scots fought&nbsp;on foot in battalions with their spears outwards, in a circular formation serving the same purpose as the modern&nbsp;square. A momentary success of the English archers&nbsp;was quickly reversed by a flank movement of Sir Robert&nbsp;Keith. The Scottish bowmen followed up his advantage,&nbsp;and the fight became general ; the English horse, crowded&nbsp;into too narrow a space, were met by the steady resistance of the Scottish pikemen, who knew Bruce told them&nbsp;truly that they fought for their country, their wives, their&nbsp;children, and all that freemen hold dear. The English&nbsp;rear was unable to come up in the narrow space or got&nbsp;entangled in the broken ranks of the van. The first repulse soon passed into a rout, and from a rout into a&nbsp;headlong flight, in which Edward himself barely escaped.&nbsp;Like Courtrai and Morgarten, Bannockburn marked the&nbsp;momentous change from mediaeval to modern warfare.&nbsp;The armed knights gave place to the common soldiers&nbsp;led by skilful generals as the arbiters of the destiny of&nbsp;nations. In the career of Bruce it was the turning-point.&nbsp;The enthusiasm of the nation he had saved forgot his&nbsp;late adhesion to the popular cause, and at the parliament&nbsp;of Ayr on 25th April 1315 the succession was settled by&nbsp;a unanimous voice on him, and, failing males of his body,&nbsp;on his brother Edward and his heirs male, failing whom&nbsp;on his daughter Marjory and her heirs, if she married with&nbsp;his consent Soon after she married Walter the Steward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The last part of Bruce’s life, from 1315 to 1329, began with an attempt which was the most striking testimony&nbsp;that could have been given to the effect of Bannockburn,&nbsp;and which, had it succeeded, might have altered the future&nbsp;of the British Isles. This was no less than the rising of&nbsp;the whole Celtic race, who had felt the galling yoke of&nbsp;Edward I. and envied the freedom the Scots had won.&nbsp;In 1315 Edward Bruce crossed to Ireland on the invitation of the natives, and in the following year the Welsh&nbsp;became his allies. In autumn Robert came to his brother,&nbsp;and they together traversed Ireland to Limerick. Dublin&nbsp;was saved by its inhabitants committing it to the flames,&nbsp;and, though nineteen victories were won, of which that&nbsp;at Slane in Louth by Robert was counted the chief, the&nbsp;success was too rapid to be permanent. The brothers&nbsp;retreated to Ulster, and, Robert having left Ireland to&nbsp;protect his own borders, Edward was defeated and killed&nbsp;at Dundalk in October 1318. On his return Bruce addressed himself to the siege of Berwick, a standing menace&nbsp;to Scotland. While preparing for it two cardinals arrived&nbsp;in England with a mission from Pope John XXII. to effect&nbsp;a truce, or, failing that, to renew the excommunication of&nbsp;Bruce. The cardinals did not trust themselves across&nbsp;the border; their messengers, however, were courteously&nbsp;received by Bruce, but with a firm refusal to admit the&nbsp;bulls into his kingdom because not addressed to him as&nbsp;king. Another attempt by Newton, guardian of the Friars&nbsp;Minor at Berwick, had a more ignominious result. Bruce&nbsp;admitted Newton to his presence at Aldcamus, where he&nbsp;might see the works for the siege going on by night and&nbsp;day, and was informed that Bruce would not receive the&nbsp;bulls until his title was acknowledged and he had taken&nbsp;Berwick. On his return Newton was waylaid and his&nbsp;papers seized, not without suspicion of Bruce’s connivance.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
