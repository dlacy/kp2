<p><span class="font1">its own administration, separate from that of the lower town. This last retains a mediæval character, λvith&nbsp;narrow tortuous streets and high tile-roofed houses often&nbsp;enclosing large storehouses within their thick walls.&nbsp;Reval has more interesting antiquities than any other&nbsp;town of the Russian Baltic provinces. The old church of&nbsp;St Nicholas, built in 1317, contains many antiquities of&nbsp;the old Catholic times and old German paintings, of&nbsp;which a Dance of Death is especially worthy of notice.&nbsp;It contains also the graves of Holstein Beck and of the&nbsp;Duc de Croy, who was denied burial for his debts, and&nbsp;whose mummy, dressed in velvet and fine lace, was exposed&nbsp;until 1862. The “Domkirche” contains many interesting shields, as also the graves of the circumnavigator&nbsp;Krusenstern, of Pontus-de-la-Gardie, Henry Matthias, Karl&nbsp;Horn, &lt;kc. The church of St Olai, first erected in 1240,&nbsp;and often rebuilt, was completed in 1840 in Gothic style;&nbsp;it has a bell tower 429 feet high. The oldest church is&nbsp;the Esthonian, built in 1219. Water is brought from&nbsp;Lake Järväkylä by an aqueduct. The pleasant situation&nbsp;of the town, surrounded by beautiful parks, attracts in&nbsp;summer thousands of people for sea-bathing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The population of Reval has increased rapidly since it has been connected by rail with St Petersburg and with Baltic&nbsp;Port, 30 miles distant; it reached 50,490 in 1881, against&nbsp;27,325 in 1867, of whom one-third are Germans, the remainder Esthonians, with a few Russians and Jews. Nearly&nbsp;15,000 inhabitants belong to the Greek Church. The&nbsp;manufactures are not important, but trade grows steadily.&nbsp;In Ï882 the exports (grain, spirits, &amp;c.) were £1,746,244,&nbsp;the imports (coal, iron, chemicals, Ac.) £6,858,247. In&nbsp;1882 Reval was visited by 589 foreign ships (291,450&nbsp;tons), mostly English, German, and Scandinavian, and by&nbsp;802 coasters (103,000 tons). It has regular steam communication with St Petersburg, Helsingfors, Königsberg,&nbsp;ιfcc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The high Silurian crag now known as Domberg was early occupied by an Esthonian fort, Lindanissa. In 1219 or 1233 the&nbsp;Danish king Waldemar II. erected there a strong castle and&nbsp;founded the first church of the Holy Ghost. In 1228 the castle&nbsp;was taken by the Livonian knights, but nine years later it returned&nbsp;to the Danes. About the same time Lübeck and Bremen&nbsp;merchants settled there under the protection of the castle, and&nbsp;their settlement soon became an important seaport of the Hanseatic&nbsp;League. It was fortified early in the 14th century, and in 1343&nbsp;sustained the siege of the revolted Esthonians. Waldemar III.&nbsp;sold Reval and Esthonia to the Livonian knighthood for 19,000&nbsp;silver marks, and the town belonged to the knighthood till its dissolution in 1561, when Esthonia and Reval surrendered to the&nbsp;Swedish king Erik XVI. A great conflagration in 1433, the pestilence of 1532, the bombardment by the Danes in 1569, and still&nbsp;more the Russo-Livonian War, broke down its formerly wealthy&nbsp;trade. The Russians not only devastated the neighbouring country&nbsp;but also besieged Reval twice, in 1570 and 1577. It was still,&nbsp;however, an important fortress, the forts and walls having been&nbsp;enlarged and fortified by the Swedes. In 1710 the commander&nbsp;Patkull surrendered it to Peter I., who immediately began there&nbsp;the erection of a military port for his Baltic fleet. The successors&nbsp;of Peter I. continued to fortify the access to Reval from the sea,&nbsp;large works being undertaken especially in the first part of the&nbsp;present century. During the Crimean War the suburb Reperbahn,&nbsp;situated on a low slip of coast, was destroyed in view of a possible&nbsp;landing of the allies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REVELATION, Book of. The book of the New Testament called “ Revelation of John ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Άποκάλυψις ‰amv) </span><span class="font1">so long passed for the most obscure and difficult document&nbsp;of early Christianity that scholars hesitated to apply to it&nbsp;the historico-critical method of investigation. Since this&nbsp;hesitation has been overcome, it appears that the matter&nbsp;of the book is neither obscure nor mysterious, although&nbsp;many special points still remain to be cleared up. Without being paradoxical we may affirm that the Apocalypse is&nbsp;the most intelligible book in the New Testament, because&nbsp;its author had not the individuality and originality of&nbsp;Paul or of the author of the Fourth Gospel, and because&nbsp;historically we can trace and comprehend its author’s position much better than we can, for instance, the theology of&nbsp;Paul. But all interpretations not strictly historical must&nbsp;bo excluded. The ethico-spiritualistic, rationalistic, and&nbsp;dogmatic explanations, such as were first attempted by the&nbsp;Alexandrine theologians, are fatal to the understanding of&nbsp;the book, as are also the explanations drawn from church&nbsp;history which were first put forward by mediæval sects.&nbsp;To see with Hengstenberg “ demagogy ” in “ Gog and&nbsp;Magog” (xx. 8), to identify “Apollyon” (ix. 11) with&nbsp;“ Napoleon,” or in antichrist to detect the emperor or&nbsp;the pope or Mohammed or Luther or Calvin—these&nbsp;interpretations are not a bit worse than those which turn&nbsp;the book into a compendium of morality or dogma wherein&nbsp;is set forth by means of imagery and allegories the triumph&nbsp;of virtue over vice or of orthodoxy over heterodoxy. The&nbsp;justification of the interpretation which explains the book&nbsp;entirely in the light of the historical circumstances attending its origin and of the views current amongst primitive&nbsp;Christians follows, above all, from observing that as a&nbsp;literary production the Revelation of John is by no means&nbsp;unique, but belongs to a class of literature (comp.&nbsp;Apocalyptic Literature, vol. ii. p. 174) which then had&nbsp;a very wide currency amongst the Jews, and the numerous&nbsp;remains of which even the most orthodox theologians do&nbsp;not hesitate to interpret by the help of the history of the&nbsp;time. The apocalyptic literature, in the strict sense of the&nbsp;word, began with the Jews in the 2d century b.c. ; in fact&nbsp;it developed as an aftergrowth of the prophetical literature,&nbsp;from which it differs less in kind than in degree. For&nbsp;more than three centuries it had sought to revive the&nbsp;drooping spirit of the people by revelations of a near future&nbsp;when, after one last dreadful onset of a hostile world,&nbsp;Jahveh would appear in the person of His Messiah to conquer the nations of the world and to set up the kingdom&nbsp;of glory for Israel. Every time the political situation culminated in a crisis for the people of God the apocalypses&nbsp;appeared stirring up the believers. In spirit, form, plan,&nbsp;and execution they closely resembled each other. Their&nbsp;differences sprang only from the difference of the times, for&nbsp;every apocalyptic writer painted the final catastrophe after&nbsp;the model of the catastrophes of his day, only on a vaster&nbsp;scale and with deepened shadows. They all spoke in riddles ;&nbsp;that is, by means of images, symbols, mystic numbers, forms&nbsp;of animals, &lt;fec., they half concealed Λvhat they meant to&nbsp;reveal. The reasons for this procedure are not far to seek :—&nbsp;( 1 ) clearness and distinctness would have been too profane—&nbsp;only the mysterious appears divine ; (2) it was often dangerous to be too distinct. The apocalyptic writers in their&nbsp;works supplied revelations on all possible questions, but&nbsp;their principal achievement was regularly a revelation of&nbsp;the history of mankind in general and of the people of&nbsp;Israel in particular ; in their most essential features the&nbsp;apocalypses are political manifestos. It is characteristic of&nbsp;all apocalypses that they pass under false names, being&nbsp;attributed to the most celebrated persons of the Old&nbsp;Testament; thus we still possess apocalypses under the&nbsp;names of Daniel, Baruch, Ezra, Moses, and Enoch. These&nbsp;old heroes are represented in the respective w<sup>r</sup>orks as&nbsp;speaking in the first person, and exhorting their readers&nbsp;to await with hope and patience the coming of the&nbsp;Messiah. Usually the apocalypse contains a brief summary&nbsp;of history, beginning with the time of the nominal and&nbsp;ending with that of the actual author, in order that the&nbsp;reader, perceiving how much of the prophecy has already&nbsp;been fulfilled to the letter, may look w<sup>τ</sup>ith assured confidence for the fulfilment of the rest. Lastly, the particular&nbsp;features in the descriptions as well as the images and&nbsp;metaphors are usually borrowed in great measure from&nbsp;the books of the old prophets, but they are painted in</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
