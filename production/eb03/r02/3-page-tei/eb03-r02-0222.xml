To the moſt rigid juſtice he added the greateſt humanity. He loved the good, and was a ſevere reprover of the lewd and infamous. His accompliſhments were equal to his virtues. He was an excellent mathematician, geometrician, and muſician ; he was equally ſhilled in painting and ſculpture; and in poetry few of his time could equal him. In ſhort, ſuch were his talents, and ſuch the ſolidity of his judgment, that though but 16 years of age, he was conſidered as a wiſe old man.</p><p>The firſt part of his reign was ſpent in a reformation of the abuſes of his predeceſſor. He reſtored the ſenators to their rank ; nothing being undertaken without the moſt ſage adviſers, and moſt mature deliberation. Among the number of his adviſers was his mother Mammæa ; a woman eminent for her virtues and accompliſhments, and who made uſe of her power as well to ſecure her ſon the affections of his ſubjects, as to procure them the moſt juſt adminiſtration. He was a rigid puniſher of ſuch magiſtrates as took bribes, ſaying, That it was not enough to deprive ſuch of their places j for their truſts being great, their lives, in moſt caſes, ought to pay for a breach of them. On the contrary, he thought he could never ſufficiently reward ſuch as had been remarkable for their juſtice and inte-' g<hi rend="sup">rit</hi>y&gt; keeping a regiſter of their names, and ſometimes aſhing ſuch of them as appeared modeſt and unwilling to approach him, why they were ſo backward in demanding their reward, and why they ſuffered him to be in their debt ? His clemency extended even to the Chriſtians, who had been puniſhed in the former reigns with unrelenting barbarity. Upon a conteſt between them and a company of cooks and vintners, about a .piece of public ground, which the one claimed as a place ſor public worſhip, and the other for exerciſing their reſpective trades, he decided the point by his re-icript, in theſe words : “ It is better that God be wor-ſhipped there in any manner, than that the place ſhould</p><p>be put to uſes of drunkenneſs and debauchery.”</p><p>His abilities in -war were not inferior to his aſſiduity in peace. The empire, which from the remiſſneſs and debauchery of the preceding reigns now began to be attacked on every ſide, wanted a perſon of vigour and conduct to defend it. Alexander faced the enemy wherever the invaſion was moſt formidable, and for a ſhort time deferred its *uirι. His firſt expedition, in the tenth year of his reign, was againſt the Parthians and Perſians, whom he oppoſed with a powerſul army.—∙ The Perſians were routed in a deciſive engagement with great ſlaughter ; the cities of Cteſiphon and Babylon were once more taken, and the Roman empire was re-ftored to its former limits. Upon his return to Antioch, his mother Mammæa ſent for the famous Origen, to be inſtructed by him in the principles of Chriſe tianity ; and after diſcourſing with him for ſome time upon the ſubject, diſmiſſed him, with a proper ſafe-guard, to his ſiative city of Alexandria. About the ſame time that Alexander was victorious in the Eaſt, Furius Celſus, his general, obtained a ſignal victory over the Mauritanians in Africa. Varius Macrinus was ſucceſsful in Germany, and Junius Palmatus returned with conqueſt from Armenia. However, the number of theſe victories only haſtened the decline of the empire, which was waſted by the exertion of its own</p><lb/><p>ſtrength, and was now becoming little more than a ſplendid ruin.</p><p>About the 13th year of his reign, the Upper Germans, and other northern nations, began to pour down immenſe ſwarms of people upon the more ſouthern parts of the empire. They paſſed the Rhine and the Danube with ſuch fury, that all Italy was thrown into the moſt extreme conſternation. The emperor, ever ready to expoſe himſelf for the ſafety of his people, made what levies he could, and went in perſon to ſtern the torrent ; which he ſpeedily effected. It was in the courſe of his ſucceſſes againſt the enemy, that he was cut off by a mutiny among his ſoldiers. The legions encamped about Moguntia, having been abominably corrupted during the reign of Heliogabalus, and trained up in all kinds of rapine and diſobedience, required the moſt ſtrict command. Alexander could neither endure their tumultuary obedience, nor they his regular diſcipline. His own faults, and thoſe of his mother Mammæa, were objected againſt him. They openly exclaimed, That they were governed by an avaricious woman, and a mean-ſpirited boy ; and reſolved upon electing an emperor capable of ruling alone. In this general revolt, Maximinus, an old and experienced commander, held frequent conferences with the ſoldiers, and enſlamed the ſedition. At length, being determined to diſpatch their preſent emperor, they ſent an executioner into his tent ; who immediately ſtruck off his head, and, ſhortly after, that of his mother. He died in the 29th year of his age, after a proſperous reign of thirteen years and nine days.</p><p>The tumults occaſioned by the death of Alexander being appeaſed, Maximinus, who had been the chief promoter of the ſedition, was choſen emperor. This extraordinar y man, whoſe character deſerves particular attention, was born of very obſcure parentage, being the ſon of a poor herdſman of Thrace. In the beginning he followed his father’s profeſſion, and only exerciſed his perſonal courage againſt the robbers who inſeſted the part of the country in which he lived. Soon after, his ambition increaſing, he leſt his poor employment, and enliſted in the Roman army ; where he ſoon became remarkable for his great ſtrength, diſcipline, and courage. This gigantic man was no leſs than eight feet and a half high ; he had a body and ſtrength correſponding to his ſize, being not leſs remarkable for the magnitude than the ſymmetry of his perſon. His wife’s bracelet uſually ſerved him for a thumb-ring ; and his ſtrength was ſo great, that he was able'to draw a carriage which two oxen could not move. He could ſtrike out an horſe’s teeth with a blow of his fiſt, and break its thigh with a kick. His diet was as extraordinary as the reſt of his endowments ; he generally eat 40 pounds weight of fleſh every day, and drank ſix gallons of wine, without committing any debauch in either. With a frame ſo athletic, he was poſſeſſed of a mind undaunted in danger, and neither fearing nor regarding any man. The firſt time he was made known to the emperor Severus, was upon his celebrating games on the birth-day of his ſon Geta. Maximinus was then a rude countryman, and requeſted the emperor to be permitted to contend for the prizes which were diſtributed to the beſt runners, wreſtlers, and boxers, of the army. Severus, unwilling to infringe the military diſcipline,</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
