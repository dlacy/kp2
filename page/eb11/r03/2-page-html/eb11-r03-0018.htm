<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RICHFIELD SPRINGS, a Adllage of Richfield township, </span><span class="font1">Otsego county, New York, U.S.A., about 22 m. S.S.E. of Utica&nbsp;and J m. N. of Schuyler (or Candarago) lake. Pop. (1890)&nbsp;1623; (1900) 1537; (1905, state census) 1684. It is served&nbsp;by the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western railway, and by the&nbsp;Oneonta &amp; Mohawk Valley electric line connecting with the&nbsp;New York Central railway at Herkimer. The village is situated&nbsp;in a farming country, about 1700 ft. above sea-level. Knit&nbsp;goods are manufactured, but the importance of the place is&nbsp;due to its sulphur springs, the waters of which are used for the&nbsp;treatment of skin diseases, gout, rheumatism, etc., and to the&nbsp;tonic air and fine scenery. In 1908 a Welsh eisteddfod was&nbsp;held here in Earlington Park. The first hotels were built&nbsp;between 1820 and 1830. A post office was established here&nbsp;in 1829, and the village was incorporated in 1861.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICH HILL, a city of Bates county, Missouri, U.S.A., situated near the Osage (Marais des Cygnes) river, in the west&nbsp;central part of the state, about 75 m. S. by E.of Kansas City.&nbsp;Pop. (1890) 4008; (1900) 4053, of whom 255 were foreign-born.&nbsp;It is served by the Missouri Pacific and the St. Louis &amp; San&nbsp;Francisco railway systems. The city has two public parks,&nbsp;and is a trading centre for the Surrouiding fertile farming&nbsp;country. Coal is mined in the vicinity. There are lead and&nbsp;zinc smelters, and a large vitrified brick and tile factory. The&nbsp;municipality owns and operates its waterworks and gas and&nbsp;electric-lighting plants; the city is supplied with natural gas.&nbsp;The original Rich Hill was platted in 1867 somewhat north-west&nbsp;of the site of the present city, which was platted in 1880 by&nbsp;an association that bought out the old settlement. The new&nbsp;settlement was incorporated as a village in 1880, and chartered&nbsp;as a city in 1881.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICHMOND, EARLS AND DUKES OF. The title earl of Richmond appears to have been in existence in England a&nbsp;considerable time before it was held in accordance with any&nbsp;strict legal principle. Alan, surnamed “ Le Roux,” and his&nbsp;brother Alan (c. 1040-1089), surnamed “ Le Noir,” relatives of&nbsp;Geoffrey, count of Brittany, and kinsman of William the Conqueror, took part in the Iatter<sup>i</sup>S invasion of England; and&nbsp;Le Roux obtained grants of land in various parts of England,&nbsp;including manors formerly held by Earl Edyrin in Yorkshire,&nbsp;on one of which he built the castle of Richmond, his possessions&nbsp;there being formed into the honour of Richmond, to which his&nbsp;brother Alan Le Noir, or Alan Niger (c. 1045-1093), succeeded&nbsp;in 1089. The latter was in turn succeeded as lord of the honour&nbsp;of Richmond by Stephen (d. 1137), count of Penthievre, who&nbsp;was either his son or another brother. These Breton counts,&nbsp;being territorial barons of great importance in England, and&nbsp;lords of the honour of Richmond where their castle was&nbsp;situated, are often reckoned as earls of Richmond, though&nbsp;they were not so in the strict and later sense. The same should&nbsp;perhaps be said of Stephen’s son Alan Niger II. (c. 1116-1146),&nbsp;though he was styled earl of Richmond by John of Hexham.&nbsp;This Alan married Bertha, daughter and heiress of Conan,&nbsp;reigning count of Brittany; and his son Conan (c. 1138-1171),&nbsp;who married Margaret, sister of Malcolm IV. of Scotland,&nbsp;asserted his right to Brittany, and transferred it in his lifetime&nbsp;to his daughter Constance (c. 1162-1201). As he left no sons the&nbsp;honour of Richmond and his other English possessioris passed&nbsp;to the king in 1171, though Constance is also loosely spoken&nbsp;of as countess of Richmond in her own right. Constance was&nbsp;three times married, and each of her husbands in turn assumed&nbsp;the title of earl of Richmond, in conjunction with that of count,&nbsp;or duke of Brittany. They were: Geoffrey Plantagenet (1158-1186), son of Henry II., king of England; Randolph de Blunde-vill, earl of Chester (c. 1172-1232), the marriage with whom&nbsp;Constance treated as null on the ground of consanguinity;&nbsp;and Guy de Thouars (d. 1213), who survived his wife for twelve,&nbsp;years. The only son of the first marriage, Arthur of Brittany&nbsp;(1187-1203), was styled earl of Richmond in his mother’s&nbsp;lifetime, and on his murder at the hands of his uncle, King&nbsp;John, the earldom was resumed by the crown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By her third husband Constance had two daughters, the elder of whom, Alice, was given in marriage by Philip Augustus,&nbsp;king of France, to Peter de Braine in 1213, after which date&nbsp;Peter was styled duke of Brittany and earl of Richmond till&nbsp;about 1235, when he renounced his allegiance to the king of&nbsp;England and thereupon suffered forfeiture of his English earldom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1241 Henry III. granted the honour of Richmond to Peter of Savoy (1203-1268), uncle of Queen Eleanor, who was&nbsp;thereafter described as earl of Richmond by contemporary&nbsp;chroniclers, though how far he was strictly entitled to the&nbsp;designation has been disputed. By his will he left the&nbsp;honour of Richmond to his niece, the queen consort, who&nbsp;transferred it to the crown. In the same year (1268) Henry III.&nbsp;granted the earldom specifically to John, duke of Brittany&nbsp;(1217-86), son of Peter de Braine, in whose family the title&nbsp;continued—though it frequently was forfeited or reverted to&nbsp;the crown and was re-granted to the next heir—till 1342, when&nbsp;it was apparently resumed by Edward III. and granted by&nbsp;that sovereign to his son John of Gaunt, who surrendered it&nbsp;in 1372. It was then given to John de Montfort, duke of&nbsp;Brittany, but on his death without heirs in 1399, or possibly&nbsp;at an earlier date through forfeiture, it reverted to the crown.&nbsp;The earldom now became finally separated from the duchy of&nbsp;Brittany, with which it had been loosely conjoined since the&nbsp;Conquest, although the dukes of Brittany continued to assume&nbsp;the title till a much later date. From 1414 to 1435 the earldom&nbsp;of Richmond was held by John Plantagenet, duke of Bedford,&nbsp;and in 1453 it was conferred on Edmund Tudor, uterine brother&nbsp;to King Henry VI., whose wife, Margaret Beaufort, was the&nbsp;foundress of St John’s College, Cambridge, and of the “ Lady&nbsp;Margaret,” professorships of divinity at Oxford and Cambridge&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Richmond and Derby, Margaret, Countess of).</span><span class="font1"> IVhen&nbsp;Edmund Tudor’s son Henry ascended the throne as Henry VII.&nbsp;in 1485, the earldom of Richmond merged in the crown, and&nbsp;for the next forty years there was no further grant of the title;&nbsp;but in 1525 Henry Fitzroy, natural son of Henry ITII. by&nbsp;Elizabeth Blound, was created duke of Richmond and Somerset&nbsp;and earl of Nottingham, all these titles becoming extinct at&nbsp;his death without children in 1536. </span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ludovic Stuart, 2nd duke of Lennox (1574-1624), who also held other titles in the peerage of Scotland, was created earl&nbsp;of Richmond in 1613 and duke of Richmond in 1623. These&nbsp;became extinct at his death in 1624, but his Scottish honours&nbsp;devolved on his brother Esme, who was already earl of March&nbsp;in the peerage of England (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">March, Earls of;</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lennox).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Esmé’s son, James, 4th duke of Lennox (1612-1655), was created&nbsp;duke of Richmond in 1,641, the two dukedoms as well as the&nbsp;lesser English and Scottish titles thus becoming again united.&nbsp;In 1672, on the death of his nephew Charles, 3rd duke of Richmond and 6th duke of Lennox, whose wife was the celebrated&nbsp;beauty called “ La Belle Stuart ” at the court of Charles II.&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Richmond and Lennox, Frances Teresa, Duchess of),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">his titles became extinct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1675 Charles II. created his illegitimate son Charles duke of Richmond, earl of March and baron Settrington, and a few&nbsp;weeks later duke of Lennox, earl of Darnley and baron Torboltoun.&nbsp;This Charles (1672-1723), on whom his father the king bestowed&nbsp;the surname of Lennox, was the son of the celebrated Louise&nbsp;de Keroualle, duchess of Portsmouth. His son Charles, 2nd duke&nbsp;( 1701-1750), added to the titles he inherited from his father&nbsp; that of duke of Aubigny in France, to which he succeeded in&nbsp;1734 on the death of his grandmother the duchess of Portsmouth; and all these honours are still held by his descendant&nbsp;the present duke of Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The seven dukes of Richmond of the Lennox line have all borne the Christian name of Charles. The 2nd duke, by his&nbsp;marriage with Sarah, daughter of the 1st Earl Cadogan, was&nbsp;father of Lady Caroline Lennox, who eloped width Henry Fox,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
