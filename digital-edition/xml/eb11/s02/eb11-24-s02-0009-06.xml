In 1823 he produced a volume of poetry in the manner of the Romanticists, entitled <hi rend="italic">Poèmes, odes, épitres.</hi> In 1836 appeared <hi rend="italic">Picciola,</hi> the story of the comte de Chamey, a political prisoner in Piedmont, whose reason was saved by his cult of a tiny flower growing between the paving stones of his prison yard. This story is a masterpiece of the sentimental kind, and has been translated into many European languages. He produced many other novels, none of striking individuality with the exception of <hi rend="italic">Seul</hi> (1857), which purported to be the authentic record of Alexander Selkirk on his desert island. Saintine was a prolific dramatist, and collaborated in some hundred pieces with Scribe and others, usually under the name of Xavier. He died on the 21st of January 1865.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
