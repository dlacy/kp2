<p><span class="font2">paintings of the Madonna and Child. On the death of his father in 1494 Raphael was left in the care of his stepmother (his&nbsp;own mother, Magia Ciarla, having died in 1491) and of his uncle,&nbsp;a priest called Bartolomeo.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">First or Perugian Period.—</span><span class="font2">In what year Raphael was apprenticed to Perugino and how the interval before that was spent are matters of doubt. Vasari’s statement that he was sent&nbsp;to Perugia during his father’s lifetime is certainly a mistake.&nbsp;On the whole it appears most probable that he did not enter&nbsp;Perugino’s studio till the end of 1499, as during the four or five&nbsp;years before that Perugino was mostly absent from his native&nbsp;city.@@<sup>2</sup> The so-called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sketch Book of Raphael</span><span class="font2"> in the academy of&nbsp;Venice contains studies apparently from the cartoons of some&nbsp;of Perugino’s Sistine frescoes, possibly done as practice in&nbsp;drawing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This celebrated collection of thirty drawings, now framed or preserved in portfolios, bears signs of having once formed a bound&nbsp;book, and has been supposed to be a sketch-book filled by Raphael&nbsp;during his Perugian apprenticeship. Many points, however, make&nbsp;this tempting hypothesis very improbable; the fact that the drawings were not all originally on leaves of the same size, and the&nbsp;miscellaneous character of the sketches—varying much both in&nbsp;style and merit of execution—seem to show that it is a collection&nbsp;of studies by different hands, made and bound together by some&nbsp;subsequent owner, and may contain but very few drawings by&nbsp;Raphael himself.</span><span class="font2">@@3</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Before long Raphael appears to have been admitted to share in the execution of paintings by his master; and his touch&nbsp;can with more or less certainty be traced in some of Perugino’s&nbsp;panels which were executed about 1502. Many of those who,&nbsp;like Crowe and Cavalcaselle, adopt the earlier date of Raphael’s&nbsp;apprenticeship, believe that his hand is visible in the execution&nbsp;of the beautiful series of frescoes by Perugino in the Sala del&nbsp;Cambio, dated 1500; as does also M. Müntz in his excellent&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Raphaël, sa vie,</span><span class="font2"> Paris, 1881, in spite of his accepting the end of&nbsp;1499 as the period of Raphael’s first entering Perugino’s studio,&nbsp;—two statements almost impossible to reconcile. Considering&nbsp;that Raphael was barely seventeen when these frescoes were&nbsp;painted, it is hardly reasonable to attribute the finest heads to&nbsp;his hand; nor did he at an early age master the difficulties&nbsp;of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fresco buono.</span><span class="font2"> The Resurrection of Christ in the Vatican&nbsp;and the Diotalevi Madonna in the Berlin Museum are the&nbsp;principal pictures by Perugino in parts of which the touch of&nbsp;Raphael appears to be visible, though any real certainty on&nbsp;this point is unattainable.@@<sup>4</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">About 1502 Raphael began to execute independent works; four pictures for churches at Città di Castello were probably&nbsp;the earliest of these, and appear to have been painted in the&nbsp;years 1502-4. The first is a gild-banner painted on one side&nbsp;with the Trinity, and below, kneeling figures of S. Sebastian&nbsp;and S. Rocco; on the reverse is a Creation of Eve, very like&nbsp;Perugino in style, but possessing more grace and breadth of&nbsp;treatment. These are still in the church of S. Trinità.@@<sup>5</sup> Also</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">for Città di Castello were the coronation of S. Niccolo Tolentino, now destroyed, though studies for it exist at Oxford and Lille&nbsp;(</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gaz. d. B. Arts,</span><span class="font2"> 1878, i. p. 48), and the Crucifixion, now in the&nbsp;Dudley collection, painted for the church of S. Domenico, and&nbsp;signed RAPHAEL VRBINAS </span><span class="font0">P. </span><span class="font2">It is a panel 8 ft.6 in. high&nbsp;by 5 ft. 5 in. wide, and contains noble figures of the Virgin,&nbsp;St John, St Jerome and St Mary Magdalene. The fourth&nbsp;painting executed for this town, for the church of S. Francesco,&nbsp;is the exquisitely beautiful and highly finished Sposalizio, now in&nbsp;the Brera at Milan, signed and dated </span><span class="font0">RAPHAEL VRBINAS&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">MDIIIL This is closely copied both in composition and detail&nbsp;from Perugino’s painting of the same subject now at Caen, but&nbsp;is far superior to it in sweetness of expression and grace of&nbsp;attitude. The Temple of Jerusalem, a domed octagon with&nbsp;outer ambulatory in Perugino’s picture, is reproduced with&nbsp;slight alterations by Raphael, and the attitudes and grouping&nbsp;of the figures are almost exactly the same in both. The Connestabile Madonna is one of Raphael’s finest works, painted&nbsp;during his Perugian period; it is a round panel; the motive, the&nbsp;Virgin reading a book of hours, is a favourite one with him, as&nbsp;it was with his father Giovanni. This lovely picture was lost to&nbsp;Perugia in 1871, when Count Connestabile sold it to the emperor&nbsp;of Russia for £13,200.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Second or Florentine Period, 1504-1508.—</span><span class="font2"> From 1504 to 1508 Raphael’s life was very stirring and active. In the first&nbsp;half of 1504 he visited Urbino, where he painted two small&nbsp;panels for Duke Guidobaldo, the St George and the St Michael&nbsp;of the Louvre. His first and for him momentous visit to&nbsp;Florence was made towards the end of 1504, when he presented&nbsp;himself with a warm letter of recommendation@@6 from his patroness&nbsp;Joanna della Rovere to the gonfaloniere Pier Soderini. In&nbsp;Florence Raphael was kindly received, and, in spite of his&nbsp;youth (being barely of age), was welcomed as an equal by the&nbsp;majority of those great artists who at that time had raised&nbsp;Florence to a pitch of artistic celebrity far above all other cities&nbsp;of the world. At the time of his arrival the whole of artistic&nbsp;Italy was being excited to enthusiasm by the cartoons of the&nbsp;battle of Anghiari and the war with Pisa, on which Leonardo&nbsp;da Vinci and Michelangelo were then devoting their utmost&nbsp;energies. To describe the various influences under which&nbsp;Raphael came, and the many sources, from which he drank in&nbsp;stores of artistic knowledge, would be to give a complete history&nbsp;of Florentine art in the 15th century.@@7 With astonishing&nbsp;rapidity he shook off the mannerisms of Perugino, and put one&nbsp;great artist after another under contribution for some special&nbsp;power of drawing, beauty of colour, or grace of composition&nbsp;in which each happened to excel. Nor was it from painters&nbsp;only that Raphael acquired his enlarged field of knowledge and&nbsp;rapidly growing powers. Sculptors like Ghiberti and Donatello&nbsp;must be numbered among those whose works helped to develop&nbsp;his new-born style.@@<sup>8</sup> The Carmine frescoes of Masaccio and&nbsp;Masolino taught this eager student long-remembered lessons of&nbsp;methods of dramatic expression.@@<sup>9</sup> Among his contemporaries&nbsp;it was especially Signorelli and Michelangelo who taught him the&nbsp;importance of precision of line and the necessity of a thorough&nbsp;knowledge of the human form.@@<sup>10</sup> From da Vinci he learnt&nbsp;subtleties of modelling and soft beauty of expression,@@<sup>11</sup> from&nbsp;Fra Bartolommeo nobility of composition and skilful treatment&nbsp;of drapery in dignified folds.@@<sup>12</sup> The friendship between Raphael&nbsp;and the last of these was very close and lasted for many years.&nbsp;The architect Baccio d'Agnolo was another of his special friends,&nbsp;at whose house the young painter enjoyed social intercourse</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@4</sup> Parts of Perugino’s beautiful triptych of the Madonna, with the archangels Raphael and Michael, painted for the Certosa near Pavia&nbsp;and now in the National Gallery of London, have been attributed to&nbsp;Raphael, but with little reason. Perugino’s grand altar-piece at&nbsp;Florence of the Assumption of the Virgin shows that he was quite&nbsp;capable of painting figures equal in beauty and delicacy to the St&nbsp;Michael of the Certosa triptych.
