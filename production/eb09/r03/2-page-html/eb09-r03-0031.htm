        <p><span class="font1">of the republic j and no man ever lived who, by the intensity of his
                patriotic and imperial feeling, by his practical experience of great affairs, and by
                the largeness of his human sympathies, was better fitted than Cicero to be
                the&nbsp;representative of the type of oratory demanded by the&nbsp;condition of the
                later republic. He elevates nearly every&nbsp;subject with which he deals, in those
                speeches at least&nbsp;which he thought worthy of preservation, by
                connecting&nbsp;it with great political or imperial issues. But with
                the&nbsp;patriotic motive of his speeches there is generally combined a great moral
                motive. Whatever were the -weaknesses and faults of his personal character, no man
                of&nbsp;antiquity had higher ethical aspirations. Nowhere is the&nbsp;Roman ideal of
                character humanized by Greek studies&nbsp;presented with more impressiveness than in
                the speeches&nbsp;of Cicero. In no writer ancient or modern do we find&nbsp;a
                greater power of moral indignation. And, while he&nbsp;inveighed against the
                enormities of the man whom he&nbsp;accused with the grave rebuke of a censor as well
                as the&nbsp;passion of a personal enemy, no advocate could feel or&nbsp;awaken in
                others a keener sympathy with the fortunes&nbsp;and the character of the man whom he
                was defending.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">To his great artistic accomplishment, perfected by practice and
                elaborate study, to the power of his patriotic, his moral, and personal sympathies,
                and his passionate emotional nature, must be added his vivid imagination and
                the&nbsp;rich and copious stream of his language, in which he had&nbsp;no rival
                among Roman writers or speakers.@@<sup>1</sup> He realizes&nbsp;with the imagination
                of a great dramatist the personages&nbsp;of his story, their feelings and motives,
                and the minutest&nbsp;details of their action. It has been said that
                Roman&nbsp;poetry has produced few, if any, great types of character.&nbsp;But the
                Verres, Catiline, Antony of Cicero are living and&nbsp;permanent types. The story
                told in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pro
                Cluentio</span><span class="font1"> may&nbsp;be true or false, but the picture of
                provincial crime which&nbsp;it presents is vividly dramatic.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Had we only known Cicero in his speeches we should have ranked him
                with Demosthenes as one who had realized&nbsp;the highest literary ideal, and
                thereby secured immortality&nbsp;to an art the effect of which is not often
                perpetuated. We&nbsp;should think of him also as the creator and master of
                Latin&nbsp;style,—the writer by -whom the amplest, most passionate,&nbsp;and most
                living powers of the language had been called&nbsp;forth and combined into a great
                and orderly literary organ.&nbsp;We know him, moreover, not only as a great orator
                but as&nbsp;a just and appreciative critic of oratory. But to his services to Roman
                oratory we have to add his services not&nbsp;indeed to philosophy but to the
                literature of philosophy,&nbsp;and his application to the exposition of his
                doctrines of the&nbsp;calmer and more equable resources of the language. If&nbsp;not
                a philosopher he is an admirable interpreter of those&nbsp;branches of philosophy
                which are fitted for practical application, and he presents us with the results of
                Greek&nbsp;reflexion vivified by his own human sympathies and his&nbsp;large
                experience of men. In giving a model of the style&nbsp;in which human interest can
                best be imparted to abstract&nbsp;discussions, he has used his great oratorical gift
                and art to&nbsp;persuade the world to accept the most hopeful opinions&nbsp;on human
                destiny and the principles of conduct most&nbsp;conducive to elevation and integrity
                of character.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >Letters</span><span class="font1"> of Cicero are the best either in his own or in
                any other language. They are thoroughly natural,—&nbsp;“ colloquia absentium
                amicorum,” to use his own phrase.&nbsp;In nearly all other published correspondence
                there is some&nbsp;medium which interrupts the natural outlet of the
                man,&nbsp;something of literary mannerism, natural reserve,
                academic&nbsp;elaborateness, and after-thought. Cicero’s letters to Atticus&nbsp;and
                to the friends with whom he was completely at his</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">ease are the most sincere and immediate expression of the thought and
                feeling of the moment. They let us into the&nbsp;secret of his most serious thoughts
                and cares, and they give&nbsp;a natural outlet to his vivacity of observation, his
                wit and&nbsp;humour, his kindliness of nature. It shows how flexible&nbsp;an
                instrument Latin prose had become in his hand, when&nbsp;it could in accordance with
                the conditions of perfect&nbsp;literary taste do justice at once to the ample and
                vehement&nbsp;volume of his oratory, to the calmer and more rhythmical&nbsp;movement
                of his philosophical meditation, and to the&nbsp;natural interchange of thought and
                feeling in the everyday intercourse of life.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Among the many rival orators of the age the most eminent were
                Hortensius and Caesar. The former, like&nbsp;other members of the aristocracy, such
                as Memmius and&nbsp;Torquatus, and like Q. Catulus in the preceding
                generation,&nbsp;was a kind of dilettante poet and a precursor of the poetry&nbsp;of
                pleasure, which attained such prominence in the elegiac&nbsp;poets of the Augustan
                age. Of Julius Caesar (100-44) as an&nbsp;orator we can judge only by his reputation
                and by the testimony of his great rival and adversary Cicero; but we are&nbsp;able
                to appreciate the special praise of perfect taste in the&nbsp;use of language
                attributed to him.@@<sup>2</sup> In his </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">Commentaries,</span><span class="font1"> by&nbsp;laying
                aside the ornaments of oratory,@@<sup>3</sup> he created the most&nbsp;admirable
                style of prose narrative, the style which presents&nbsp;interesting events in their
                sequence of time and dependence&nbsp;on the will of the actor, rapidly and vividly,
                with scarcely&nbsp;any colouring of personal or moral feeling, any
                oratorical&nbsp;passion, any pictorial illustration. While he shows
                the&nbsp;persuasive art of an orator by presenting the subjugation&nbsp;of Gaul and
                his own action in the Civil War in the light&nbsp;most favourable to his claim to
                rule the Roman world, he&nbsp;is entirely free from the Roman fashion of
                self-laudation&nbsp;or disparagement of an adversary. Yet the character of&nbsp;the
                man is stamped on every line that he writes, and&nbsp;reveals itself especially in a
                perfect simplicity of style, the&nbsp;result of the clearest intelligence and the
                strongest sense&nbsp;of personal dignity. He avoids not only every unusual&nbsp;but
                every superfluous word; and, although no writing can&nbsp;be more free from
                rhetorical colouring, yet there may&nbsp;from time to time be detected a glow of
                sympathy, like the&nbsp;glow of generous passion in Thucydides, the more
                effective&nbsp;from the reserve with which it betrays itself whenever he&nbsp;is
                called on to record any act of personal heroism or of&nbsp;devotion to military
                duty.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">In the simplicity of his style, the directness of his narrative, the
                entire absence of any didactic tendency,&nbsp;Caesar presents a marked contrast to
                another prose writer&nbsp;of that age,—the historian Sallust (87-34). Like
                Varro,&nbsp;he survived Cicero by some years, but the tone and spirit&nbsp;in which
                his works are written assign him to the republican&nbsp;era. He was the first of the
                purely artistic historians, as&nbsp;distinct from the annalists and the writers of
                personal&nbsp;memoirs. He imitated the Greek historians in taking particular
                actions—the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jugurthan
                War</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">Catilinarian&nbsp;Conspiracy—</span><span class="font1"
                >as the subjects of artistic treatment. He&nbsp;wrote also a continuous work,
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Historic,</span><span
                class="font1"> treating of the&nbsp;events of the twelve years following the death
                of Sulla,&nbsp;of which only fragments are preserved. His two extant&nbsp;works are
                more valuable as artistic studies of the rival&nbsp;parties in the state and of
                personal character than as&nbsp;trustworthy narratives of facts. His style aims at
                effectiveness by pregnant expression, sententiousness, archaism.&nbsp;He produces
                the impression of caring more for the manner&nbsp;of saying a thing than for its
                truth. Yet he has great&nbsp;value as a painter of historical portraits, some of
                them&nbsp;those of his contemporaries, and as an author who had</span></p><div>
