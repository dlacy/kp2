<p><label>ROSA</label>
the Rose : A genus of the polygamia order, belonging to the icoſandria claſs of plants ; and in the natural method ranking under the 35th order, <hi rend="italic">Sen-tocoſx.</hi> There are five petals ; the calyx is urceolated, quinquefid, cornous, and ſtraitened at the neck. The ſeeds are numerous, hiſpid, and affixed to the inſide of the calyx.</p><p>The forts of roſes are very numerous ; and the bo-taniſts find it very difficult to determine with accuracy which are ſpecies and which are varieties, as well as which are varieties of the reſpective ſpecies. On this account Linnæus, and ſome other eminent authors, arc inclined to think that there is only one real ſpecies of roſe, which is the <hi rend="italic">roſa canina,</hi> or “ dog-roſe of the hedges,” &amp;c. and that all the other forts are accidental varieties of it. However, according to the preſent Linnæan arrangement, they ſtand divided into 14 ſuppoſed ſpecies, each comprehending varieties, which in ſome forts are but few, in others numerous.</p><p>The ſuppoſed ſpecies and their varieties, according to the arrangement of modern botaniſts, are as follow :</p><p>I. The canina, canine roſe, wild dog-roſe of the hedges, or hep-tree, grows five or fix feet high, having prickly-ſtalks and branches, pinnated, five or ſeven-lobed leaves, with aculeated foot-ſtalks, ſmooth pedunculi, oval ſmooth germina, and ſmall ſingle flowers. There are two varieties, red-flowered and white-flow-ered. They grow wild in hedges abundantly all over the kingdom ; and are ſometimes admitted into gardens, a few to increaſe the variety of the ſhrubbery col</p><p>lection.</p><p>2. The alba, or common white-roſe, grows five or fix feet high, having a green item and branches, armed with prickles, hiſpid pedunculi, oval ſmooth germina, and large white flowers. The varieties are,—large double white roſe—dwarf ſingle white roſe—maidens-bluſh white roſe, being large, produced in cluſters, and of a white and bluſh-red colour.</p><p>3. The Gallica, or Gallican roſe, &amp;c. grows from about three or four to eight or* ten feet high, in different varieties; with pinnated, three, five, or ſeven-lobed leaves, and large red and other coloured flowers in different forts. This ſpecies is very extenſive in ſuppoſed varieties, bearing the above ſpeciſic diſtinction, ſeveral of which have been formerly conſidered as diſtinct ſpecies, but are now ranged among the varieties of the Gallican roſe, conſiſting of the following noted varieties.</p><p>Common red officinal roſe, grows erect, about three or four feet high, having ſmall branches, with but few prickles, and large ſpreading half-double deep-red</p>

<p>flowers.-— Roſa mundi (roſe of the world) or ſtriped red roſe, is a variety of the common red roſe, growing ] but three or four feet high, having large ſpreading ſemi- ∣ double red flowers, beautifully ſtriped with white—and 1 deep red.—York and Lancaſter variegated roſe, grows <hi rend="sup">,</hi> five, fix, or eight feet high, or more ; bearing variegated red flowers, conſiſting of a mixture of red and ■ white ; alſo frequently diſpoſed in elegant ſtripes, ſometimes in half of the flower, and ſometimes in ſome of the petals.—Monthly roſe, grows about four or five feet high, with green very prickly ſhoots ; producing middle-ſized, moderately double, delicate flowers, of different colours in the varieties. The varieties are, common red-flowered monthly roſe—bluſh-flowered— white-flowered—ſtriped-flowered. All of which blow both early and late, and often produce flowers ſeveral months in the year, as May, June, and July ; and frequently again in Auguſt or September, and ſometimes, in fine mild ſeaſons, continues till November or December : hence the name <hi rend="italic">monthly roſe.—</hi> Double virgin-roſe, grows five or fix feet high, having greeniſh branches with ſcarce any ſpines ; and with large double pale-red and very fragrant flowers.— Reddamaſk roſe, grows eight or ten feet high, having greeniſh branches, armed wfith ſhort aculea; and moderately-dcuble, fine ſoft-red, very fragrant flowers.—White damaſk roſe, grows eight or ten feet high, with greeniſh very prickly branches, and whitiſh-red flowers, becoming gradually of a whiter colour. — Bluſh Belgic roſe, grows three or four feet high, or more ; having greeniſh prickly branches, five or ſeven lobed leaves, and numerous, very double, bluſh-red flowers, wfith ſhort petals, evenly arranged.-—Red Belgic roſe, having greeniſh and red ſhoots and leaves, and fine double deep-red flowers.- Velvet roſe, grows three or four feet high, armed with but few prickles ; producing large velvet-red flowers, comprifing ſemi-double and double varieties, all very beautiful roſes.— Marbled roſe, grow <hi rend="sup">r</hi> s four or five feet high, having browniſh branches, wfith but few prickles ; and large, double, finely-marbled, red flow <hi rend="sup">r</hi> ers.—Red-and-yellow Auſtrian roſe, grows five or fix feet high, having llender reddiſh-branches, armed with ſhort browniſh aculea ; and with flowers of a reddiſh copper colour on one fide, the other fide yellow. This is a curious variety, and the flowers aſſume a Angularly agreeable appearance.— Yellow Auſſrian roſe, grows five or fix feet high, having reddiſh very prickly ſhoots ; and numerous bright-yellow flowers.— Double yellow roſe, grow <hi rend="sup">r</hi> s ſix or ſeven feet high ; wfith browniſh branches, armed with numerous large and ſmall yellowiſh prickles ; and large very double yellow flowers.—Frankfort roſe, grows eight or ten feet high, is a vigorous ſhooter, with browmiſh branches thinly armed with ftrong prickles ; and produces largiſh double purpliſh-red flowers, that blow irregularly, and have but little fragrance.</p><p>4. The centiſolia, or hundred-leaved red roſe, &amp;c. grows from about three or four to fix or eight feet high, in different forts, all of them hiſpid and prickly; pinnated three and five lobed leaves ; and large very double red flowers, having very numerous petals, and of different ſhades in the varieties- The varieties are, — common Dutch hundred-leaved roſe, grows three or four feet high, with erect greeniſh branches, but moderately armed with prickles ; and large remarkably double red flowers, with ſhort regularly arranged petals.</p><p>—Bluſh hundred leaved roſe, grows like the other, with</p><p>large very double pale-red flowers___Provence roſe,</p><p>grows five or ſix feet, with greeniſh-browm prickly branches, and very large double globular red flowers, with large petals folding over one another, more or leſs in the varieties.—The varieties are, common red Provence roſe, and pale Provence roſe ; both of which having larger and ſomewhat looſer petals than the following fort.—Cabbage Provence roſe ; having the petals cloſely folded over one another like cabbages— Dutch cabbage roſe, very large, and cabbages tolerably. — Childing Provence roſe—Great royal roſe, grows ſix or eight feet high, producing remarkably large, ſomewhat looſe, but very elegant flowers.—-All theſe are large double red flowers, ſomewhat globular at ſirſt blowing, becoming gradually a little ſpreading at top, and are all very ornamental fragrant roſes.—Moſs Provence roſe, ſuppoſed a variety of the common roſe ; grows erectly four or five ſeet high, having browniſh ſtalks -end branches, very cloſely armed with ſhort prickles, and double crimſon-red flowers ; having the calyx and upper part of the peduncle ſurrounded. wfith a rough moſſy-like ſubſtance, effecting a curious Angularity. This is a fine delicate roſe, of a high fragrance, which, together wfith its moſſy calyx, renders it of great eſtimation as a curioiity.</p><p>5. The cinnamomea, or cinnamon roſe, grows five or ſix feet high, or more, with purpliſh branches thinly aculeated; pinnated five or ſeven lobed leaves, having almoſt inermous petioles, ſmooth pedunculi, and ſmooth globular germina ; with ſmall purpliſh-red cinnamon-ſcented flowers early in May. There are varieties with double flowers.</p><p><hi rend="italic">6.</hi> The Alpina, or Alpine inermous roſe, growls five or ſix ſeet high, having ſmooth or unarmed reddiſh branches, pinnated ſeven-lobed ſmooth leaves, ſomewhat hiſpid pedunculi, oval germina, and deep-red ſingle flowers ; appearing in May. This ſpecies, as being free fron; all kind of armature common to the other forts of roſes, is eſteemed as a ſingularity ; and from this property is often called the <hi rend="italic">virgin roſe.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">q.</hi> The Carolina, or Carolina and Virginia roſe, &amp;c. grows fix or eight ſeet high, or more, having ſmooth reddiſh branches, very thinly aculeated; pinnated ſeven-lobed ſmooth leaves, with prickly foot-ſtalks; ſomewhat hiſpid pedunculi, globoſe hiſpid germen, and fiπgle red flowers in cluſters, appearing moſtly in Auguſt and September. The varieties are, dwarf Pennſylvanian roſe, with ſingle and double red flowers—American pale-red roſe. This ſpecies and varieties grow naturally in different parts of North America; they effect a fine variety in our gardens, and are in eſtimation ſor their late-flowering property, as they often continue in blow from Auguſt until October ; and the flowers are ſucceeded by numerous red berry-like heps in autumn, cauſing a variety all winter.</p><p>8. The villoſa, or villoſe apple-bearing roſe, grows ſix or eight feet high, having ſtrong erect browniſh ſmooth branches ;. aculeated ſparſedly pinnated ſeven-lobed villoſe or hairy leaves, downy underneath, with prickly foot-ſtalks, hiſpid peduncles, a globular prickly germen ; and large ſingle red flowers, ſucceeded by large round prickly heps, as big as little apples. Thia ſpecies merits admittance into every collection as a cu-rioſity for the ſingularity of its fruit, both for variety</p>

<p>and uſe ; for it having a thick pulp of an agreeable acid relilh, is often made into a tolerable good ſweet-meat.</p><p>9. The pimpinellifolia, or burnet-leaved roſe, grows about a yard high, aculeated ſparſedly ; ſmall neatly pinnated ſeven-lobed leaves, having obtuſe folioles and rough petioles, ſmooth pedu∏cules, a globular ſmooth germen, and ſmall fingle flowers. There are varieties with red flowers—and with white flowers. They grow wild in England, &amp;c. and are cultivated in ſhrubbe-ries for variety.</p><p>10. The ſpinofiſſima, or moil ſpinous, dwarf bιlrnet-leaved roſe, commonly called <hi rend="italic">Scotch roſe,</hi> grows but two or three feet high, very cloſely armed with ſpines ; ſmall neatly pinnated ſeven-lobed leaves, with prickly foot-ſtalks, prickly pedunculi, oval ſmooth germen, and numerous ſmall fingle flowers, filcceeded by round dark«· purple heps. The varieties are, common white-flowered</p><p>--red-flowered—ſtriped-flowered--marbled-flowered.</p><p>They grow naturally in England, Scotland, &amp;c. The firſt variety riſes near a yard high, the others but one or two feet, all of which are fingle-flowered ; but the flowers being numerous all over the branches, make à pretty appearance in the collection.</p><p>11. The eglanteria, eglantine roſe, or ſweet briar, grows five or fix feet high, having green branches, armed with ſtrong ſpines ſparſedly ; pinnated ſeven-lobed odoriferous leaves, with acute folioles and rough foot-ſtalks, ſmooth pedunculi, globular ſmooth germiha, and ſmall pale-red flowers. The varieties are, common ſingle-flowered—ſemi-double flowered—double-flowered—bluſh double-flowered—-yellow-flowered. Tliisſpe-cies grows naturally in ſome parts of England, and in Switzerland. It claims culture in every garden for the odoriferous property of its leaves ; and ſhould be planted in the borders, and other compartments contiguous to walks, or near the habitation, where the plants will impart their refreſhing fragrance very profulely all around ; and the young branches arc excellent for improving the odour of noſe-gays and bow-pots.</p><p>12. The moſehata, or muſk-roſe, ſuppoſed to be a variety only of the ever-green muſk-roſe, hath weak ſmooth green ſtalks and branches, rifing by ſupport from fix to eight or ten feet high or more, thinly armed with ſtrong ſpines ; pinnated ſeven-lobed ſmooth leaves, with prickly foot-ſtalks ; hifpid peduncles ; oval hilj&gt;id germen; and all the branches terminated by large umbellate cluſters of pure-white muſk-ſcented flowers in Auguſt, &amp;c.</p><p>13. The ſempervirens, or ever-green mulk roſe, hath a ſomewhat trailing ſtalk and branches, rifing by ſupport five or fix feet high or more, having a ſmooth bark armed with prickles; pinnated five-lobed ſmooth ſhining evergreen leaves, with prickly petioles, hifpid pedunculi, oval hifpid germen ; and all the branches terminated by dufters of pure-white flowers of a muſky fragrance ; appearing the end of July, and in Auguſt. The ſemper-virent property of this elegant ſpecies renders it a curi-ofity among the roſy tribe ; it alſo makes a fine appearance as a ſtowering ſhrub. There is one variety, the deciduous muſk-roſe above-mentioned. This ſpecies and variety flower in Auguſt, and is remarkable for producing them numerouſly in cluſttrs, continuing in ſucceſſion till October or November.</p><p>The above 13 ſpecies of roſa, and their refpective va</p><p>rieties, are of the ſhrub kind ; all deciduous, except the laſt fort, and of hardy growth, ſucceeding in any common foil and fituation, and flowering annually in great abundance from May till October, in different forts ; though the general flowering ſeaſon for the principal part of them is June and July : but in a full collection of the different ſpecies, the blow is continued in conſtant ſucceſſion ſeveral months, even ſometimes from May till near Chriſtmas ; producing their flowers uni* verſally on the fame year’s ſſioots, rifing from thoſe the year before, generally on long pedunculi, each terminated by one or more roſes, which in their eharacteri-ſtſe ſtate conſiſt each of five large petals and many ſta-mina; but in the doubles, the petals are very numerous; and in ſome forts, the flowers are ſucceeded by fruit ripening to a red colour in autumn and winter, from the feed of which the plants may be raiſed : but the moſt certain and eligible mode of propagating moſt of the forts is by fuckers and layers ; and by which methods they may be increaſed very expeditiouſly in great abundance.</p><p>The white and red roſes are uſed ill medicine. The former diſtſlled with water yields a ſmall portion of a butyraceoys oil, whoſe flavour exactly reſembles that of the roſes themſelves. This oil and the diſtilled water are very uſeful and agreeable cordials. Theſe roſes alſo, befides the cordial and aromatic virtues which refιde in their volatile parts, have a mild purgative one, which remains entire in the decoction left after diſtſllation. The red roſe, on the contrary, has an aſtringent and gratefully corroborating virtue.</p>
