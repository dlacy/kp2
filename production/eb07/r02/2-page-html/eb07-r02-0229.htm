<p><span class="font1">appearance of this edition, Mr Bowles published “ A final Appeal to the Literary Public, relative to Pope, in Reply&nbsp;to certain Observations of Mr Roscoe, in his Edition of that&nbsp;Poet’s Works ; to which are added, some Remarks on Lord&nbsp;Byron’s Conversations, so far as they relate to the same&nbsp;subject and the Author : in Letters to a Literary Friend.”&nbsp;To this publication Mr Roscoe speedily replied in “ A Letter to the Rev. W. Lisle Bowles, A. M. Prebendary of Sa-rum, &amp;c. in Reply to his ‘ Final Appeal to the Literary Public relative to Pope.’” His edition, as well as his Letter,&nbsp;obtained a favourable notice in the Quarterly Review for&nbsp;October 1825 ; and Mr Bowles was induced to publish&nbsp;“ Lessons in Criticism to William Roscoe, Esq. F. R. S. &amp;c.&nbsp;in Answer to his Letter to the Rev. W. L. Bowles, on the&nbsp;Character and Poetry of Pope. With further Lessons in&nbsp;Criticism to a Quarterly Reviewer.” These lessons in criticism were not very satisfactory to the public, and Mr Roscoe&nbsp;wisely desisted from any further controversy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1827 he published an edition of the Life of Lorenzo in two, and of the History of Leo in four volumes octavo.&nbsp;He had now reached an advanced period of life, and had&nbsp;begun to feel the pressure of age. Towards the close of&nbsp;tllis year, he was suddenly attacked with paralysis, which&nbsp;affected one side of hie face, and deprived him of the use of&nbsp;one hand ; but medical aid was promptly procured, and he&nbsp;recovered the use of his hand, as well as of his speech. Botany had been among the number of his favourite pursuits.&nbsp;He had been a contributor to the Transactions of the Lin-næan Society, and was regarded as no mean proficient in&nbsp;this science. After his recovery from the paralytic attack,&nbsp;he published the fifteenth and concluding number of a&nbsp;splendid volume on Monandrian Plants. Towards the end&nbsp;of June 1831 he experienced a severe atcack of influenza;&nbsp;and after he seemed to be recovering, he was on the 27th&nbsp;of that month seized with a violent fit of shivering, accompanied with almost total prostration of strength. The near&nbsp;approach of death he contemplated with calm resignation&nbsp;to the will of God. On the 30th he closed his mortal career,&nbsp;after having completed the seventy-eighth year of his age.&nbsp;The proximate cause of his death was an effusion into the&nbsp;chest. His remains were interred in the burying ground&nbsp;of the Unitarian chapel in Renshaw Street, the service being performed by his intimate friend Mr Shepherd. Six&nbsp;sons and two daughters survived him. One daughter he&nbsp;had lost in her infancy, and a son in his mature age. His&nbsp;eldest daughter was married to Thomas Jcvons, Esq. of&nbsp;Liverpool. One of his sons, who still survives, is well&nbsp;known as a man of letters. Another has too speedily followed the father to the grave. He was a barrister at law ;&nbsp;and, besides several works connected with his own profession, he published an interesting though somewhat diffuse&nbsp;account of his honoured father’s life.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Dr Traill, the friend and physician of this eminent man, speaks of him in the following terms. “ In person, Mr&nbsp;Roscoe was tall and rather slender. In early life he possessed much bodily activity. His hair was light auburn,&nbsp;almost inclining to red; his full grey eye was clear and&nbsp;mild ; his face expressive and cheerful. As he advanced&nbsp;in life, the benevolent expression of his countenance remained, but the vivacity of the features was tempered into&nbsp;a noble dignity, which it was impossible to see without respect and admiration ; while the mouth bespoke taste and&nbsp;feeling, and the clustering hoary hair round his temples&nbsp;gave a venerable air to his manly features....Of the qualities of his heart, as a private individual, it is impossible to&nbsp;speak too highly. In the relations of husband, father, and&nbsp;friend, his conduct was most exemplary ; and it would be</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">difficult to point out a man who possessed the fascination of manner which attracts and rivets attachment, in a higher&nbsp;degree than William Roscoe.”@@<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(x.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROSCOMMON, an inland county in the province of Connaught, in Ireland, is bounded on the north by the&nbsp;county of Sligo, on the east by those of Leitrim, Longford,&nbsp;and Westmeath, on the south-east by the King’s County,&nbsp;on the south-west by Galway, and on the west by the same&nbsp;county and by Mayo. It extends over a surface of 609,405&nbsp;acres, of which 453,555 are cultivated, 131,063 are uncultivated mountain or bog, and 24,787 are under water. According to Ptolemy, it was inhabited by the Auteri ; afterwards the tribes or septs of the O’Conors, O’Kellys,&nbsp;M'Dermots, O'Flanegans, O’Flyns, and O’Hanlys, were&nbsp;the chief possessors of it. Shortly after the arrival of the&nbsp;English in the reign of Henry II. it was seized upon by the&nbsp;new settlers, and their maintenance of it secured by the&nbsp;erection of several fortresses. For a long period afterwards&nbsp;the whole province was considered as consisting but of two&nbsp;counties, that of Roscommon being one, and all the remainder, with the county of Clare included, the other, under the&nbsp;name of the county of Connaught. This arrangement continued until the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth, when&nbsp;the whole province underwent a new classification, and the&nbsp;county of Roscommon was divided into the baronies of&nbsp;Athlone, Ballintubber, Boyle, Moycarnon, and Roscommon. At the close of the war of 1641, nearly all the former proprietors were dispossessed for having espoused the&nbsp;royal cause, and their possessions transferred to the republican adventurers and soldiers ; since which period, that&nbsp;branch of the O’Conor family, once sovereigns of all Ireland, now known by the name of the O’Conor Don, is the&nbsp;only one of the former possessors who holds any part of&nbsp;ancestral possessions in the country. The five baronies&nbsp;are subdivided into fifty-three parishes, and four parts of&nbsp;parishes, the remaining parts of which are in some of the&nbsp;adjoining counties. According to the ecclesiastical arrangements of the country, Roscommon contains fifty-seven&nbsp;parishes, of which fifty-one are in the diocese of Elphin,&nbsp;three in Tuam, two in Clonfert, and one in Ardagh. The&nbsp;seat of the bishopric of Elphin is in the town of the same&nbsp;name in the county.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Roscommon is in shape long and narrow, extending sixty miles in a northern and southern direction, whilst its breadth&nbsp;from east to west, where greatest, is but thirty-two miles ;&nbsp;and it decreases gradually until it terminates in a point in&nbsp;its southern extremity. The greatest part of it is level,&nbsp;forming the western portion of the central flœtz limestone&nbsp;field of Ireland ; varied, however, by frequent inconsider-ble elevations, and by long low ridges or escars formed of&nbsp;limestone gravel. In the north the country rises into rugged mountains with abrupt precipitous sides and flattened&nbsp;summits, the highest of which, Bracklieve and Slieve&nbsp;Corkagh, are upwards of a thousand feet above the level of&nbsp;the sea. The equally wild though less elevated range of the&nbsp;Curlew Mountains also forms part of the northern boundary. The Slieve Bawn Mountains range along the middle&nbsp;part of the eastern boundary. Slieve Aluyn, in the west, is&nbsp;also of considerable height. No large river passes through&nbsp;the county, but both its eastern and western limits are watered by navigable streams. To the east the Shannon rolls&nbsp;its immense volume of waters along that whole side, and on&nbsp;the west the Suck, which is navigable for barges to Ballina-sloe, unites with the Shannon at the extreme south point.&nbsp;The rivers in the interior, which are small and insignificant,&nbsp;are all tributaries to one or other of these main channels,&nbsp;and chiefly to the former, discharging themselves into their</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
