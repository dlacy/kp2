<p><span class="font1">and those who act under their authority from liability for injuries caused thereby. Any prosecution for an offence&nbsp;against the Act must be commenced within twelve months&nbsp;after the offence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By 24 &amp; 25 Viet. c. 97, § 11, it is a felony punishable with penal servitude for life for persons riotously and&nbsp;tumultuously assembled together to the disturbance of the&nbsp;public peace to unlawfully and with force demolish or&nbsp;begin to demolish or pull down or destroy any building,&nbsp;public building, machinery, or mining plant. By § 12 it&nbsp;is a misdemeanour punishable with seven years’ penal servitude to injure or damage such building, &amp;c. A riotous&nbsp;assembly of three or more seamen unlawfully and with&nbsp;force preventing, hindering, or obstructing the loading or&nbsp;unloading or the sailing or navigation of any vessel, or&nbsp;unlawfully and with force boarding any vessel with intent&nbsp;to do so, constitutes a misdemeanour punishable with&nbsp;twelve months’ hard labour, 33 Geo. III. c. 67. In addition to these Acts, there are others aimed at crimes of a&nbsp;somewhat similar nature, such as assembly for the purpose&nbsp;of smuggling, going armed in pursuit of game by night,&nbsp;forcible entry and detainer, political meetings in the city of&nbsp;Westminster, tumultuous petitioning, and unlawful drilling.&nbsp;For these offences see Stephen, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Digest of the Criminal Law,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">art. 76-82.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is the duty of a magistrate at the time of a riot to assemble subjects of the realm, whether civil or military, for the purpose of&nbsp;quelling a riot. In this duty he is aided by the common law, under&nbsp;which all subjects of the realm are bound to assist on reasonable&nbsp;warning, and by various enactments enabling the authorities to call&nbsp;out the auxiliary and reserve forces for the suppression of riot, and&nbsp;to close public houses where a riot is apprehended. It is his duty to&nbsp;keep the peace ; if the peace be broken, honesty of intention will&nbsp;not avail him if he has been guilty of neglect of duty. The&nbsp;question is whether he did all that he knew was in his power and&nbsp;which could be expected from a man of ordinary prudence, firmness, and activity. The law as thus stated is gathered from the&nbsp;opinions of the judges on the trials of the lord mayor of London&nbsp;and the mayor of Bristol on indictments for neglect of duty at the&nbsp;time of the Gordon riots of 1780 and the Bristol riots in 1831.@@<sup>1</sup> In&nbsp;addition to his liability to an indictment at common law, a&nbsp;defaulting magistrate is subject under the provisions of 13 Hen.&nbsp;IV. c. 7 and 2 Hen. V. st. 1, c. 8, to a penalty of £100 for every&nbsp;default, the default to be inquired of by commission under the&nbsp;great seal. A matter of interest is the extent of the protection&nbsp;afforded by the Riot Act to soldiers acting under the commands of&nbsp;their officers. The soldier is at the same time a citizen, and the&nbsp;mere fact of his being a soldier is not sufficient to exonerate him&nbsp;from all responsibility. No case in which the question has called&nbsp;for decision seems to have arisen. It is the opinion of Mr Justice&nbsp;Stephen that a soldier would be protected by orders for which he&nbsp;might reasonably believe his superior officer to have good grounds&nbsp;(</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Criminal Law,</span><span class="font0"> vol. i. 206). On the other hand, he&nbsp;would probably not be protected by an order plainly unnecessary,&nbsp;such as an order to fire into a crowd of women and children when&nbsp;no violence was observable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The civil remedy given to those whose property has suffered by riot is of an exceptional character. The action is brought against&nbsp;the hundred in which the riot took place. This liability of the&nbsp;hundred is a survival of the pre-Conquest obligation of the hundred&nbsp;and tithing to pursue and do justice on the thief : the hundred is&nbsp;supposed to guarantee the orderly conduct of its inhabitants, and&nbsp;is liable to damages for its failure to preserve order. The liability&nbsp;of the hundred in case of robbery was enacted as early as the&nbsp;Statute of Winchester, 13 Edw. I. st. 2. That and subsequent&nbsp;Acts were repealed by 7 &amp; 8 Geo. IV. c. 27, and their provisions&nbsp;were consolidated and amended by 7 &amp; 8 Geo. IV. c. 31. The Act&nbsp;gives a remedy against the hundred in the case of any church,&nbsp;chapel, house, machinery, &amp;c., being “ feloniously demolished,&nbsp;pulled down, or destroyed, wholly or in part, by any persons&nbsp;riotously and tumultuously assembled together.” A summary&nbsp;remedy is given for damage not exceeding £30. The remedy is&nbsp;extended to injury to threshing machines by 2 &amp; 3 Will. IV. c.&nbsp;72. It has been held that damage to a house will not entitle the&nbsp;owner to compensation from the hundred unless the intention of&nbsp;the rioters was to totally destroy the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Riot Act does not extend to Ireland. But similar provisions are contained in the Act of the Irish Parliament of 27 Geo. III. c.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> Reports of these trials will be found in Carrington and Payne’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Reports,</span><span class="font0"> vol. v., p. 254.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">15, as amended by 5 &amp; 6 Viet. c. 28. An offence peculiar to Ireland and punishable with penal servitude for life under the&nbsp;provisions of the Acts above mentioned is the sending of a notice,&nbsp;letter, or message exciting or tending to excite a riot. The&nbsp;Prevention of Crimes Act, 1882, enabled summary proceedings to&nbsp;be taken against rioters. The Act was temporary only, expiring&nbsp;with the session of Parliament 1885.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Scotland a riot may be either rioting and mobbing or rioting and breach of the peace. The first is much the same as the riot of&nbsp;English law. “ Mobbing consists in the assembling of a number&nbsp;of people and their combining against order and peace to the alarm&nbsp;of the lieges” (Macdonald, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Criminal Law,</span><span class="font0"> 180). The second&nbsp;offence occurs where concourse or a common purpose are wanting.&nbsp;Numerous Acts against riot and unlawful convocation were passed&nbsp;by the Scottish parliament at different times, beginning as early as&nbsp;1457. The Riot Act (1 Geo. I.) applies to Scotland. The liability&nbsp;of the county or burgh for destruction of property by riot is provided for by the Riot Act and by several Acts of Parliament of the&nbsp;reign of George III.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the United States the law is based upon that of England. In some States there is a statutory proclamation for the dispersion&nbsp;of rioters in words almost identical with those of the British Riot&nbsp;Act. The city, town, or county, according to circumstances, is&nbsp;liable for the damage caused by rioters. In some cases a remedy&nbsp;over against the rioters is given by legislation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J. W+. )</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIPARIAN LAWS. By the law of England the property in the bed and water of a tidal river as high as&nbsp;the tide ebbs and flows at a medium spring tide is presumed to be in the crown or a grantee of the crown,&nbsp;generally the lord of a manor, and the bed and water of a&nbsp;non-tidal river are presumed to belong to the person through&nbsp;whose land it flows, or, if it divide two properties, to the&nbsp;riparian proprietors, the rights of each extending to midstream </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(ad medium fllum aquæ).</span><span class="font1"> In order to give&nbsp;riparian rights, the river must flow in a defined channel,&nbsp;or at least above ground. The diminution of underground&nbsp;water collected by percolation does not give a cause of&nbsp;action to the owner of the land in which it collects, though&nbsp;he is entitled to have it unpolluted unless a right of pollution be gained against him by prescription. As a general&nbsp;rule a riparian proprietor, whether on a tidal or a non-tidal&nbsp;river, has full rights of user of his property. The most&nbsp;important limitations of these rights will be found under&nbsp;the headings Fisheries and Navigation Laws. In both&nbsp;these cases the rights of the riparian proprietors are subject&nbsp;to the intervening rights of other persons. These rights&nbsp;vary according as the river is navigable or not, or tidal or&nbsp;not. For instance, all the riparian proprietors might&nbsp;combine to divert a non-navigable river, though one alone&nbsp;could not do so as against the others, but no combination&nbsp;of riparian proprietors could defeat the right of the public&nbsp;to have a navigable river maintained undiverted. It is&nbsp;proposed in this place to consider shortly the rights&nbsp;enjoyed by, and the limitations imposed upon, riparian&nbsp;proprietors, in addition to those falling under the head of&nbsp;fishery or navigation. In these matters English law is in&nbsp;substantial accordance with the law of other countries,&nbsp;most of the rules being deduced from Roman law. Perhaps&nbsp;the main difference is that running water is in Roman law&nbsp;a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res communis,</span><span class="font1"> like the air and the sea. In England,&nbsp;owing to the greater value of river water for manufacturing&nbsp;and other purposes, it cannot be said to be common property,&nbsp;even though it may be used for navigation. The effect of&nbsp;this difference is that certain rights, public in Roman law,&nbsp;such as mooring and unloading cargo, bathing and towing,&nbsp;are only acquirable by prescription or custom in England.&nbsp;A hut might lawfully be built on the shore of a tidal river&nbsp;by Roman law ; in England such a building would be a&nbsp;mere trespass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The principal rights enjoyed by riparian owners as such are the right of increase of property by means of alluvion&nbsp;and the right of use of the water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Alluvion is the gradual and imperceptible increase of land by deposit; a sudden and violent changing of the course of a stream&nbsp;by a flood does not change the property. The addition to property</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
