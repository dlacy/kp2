<p><span class="font1">He calls on the judges to conceive the wise and good of old as rising and surrounding the tribunal,—Solon entreating&nbsp;the judges to respect their oaths and the laws,—Aristides&nbsp;in anguish deploring the perversion of justice. “ Think ye&nbsp;not,” exclaims he in conclusion, “ think ye not that Themistocles, and they who died at Marathon and at Platæa,—&nbsp;ay, and the very graves of your forefathers,—will utter&nbsp;groans, if he who avows that he conspired with the barbarians against the Greeks shall be publicly honoured by&nbsp;your decree ?” It is provoking to be compelled to add, that&nbsp;this admirable close does not conclude the oration. A few&nbsp;common-place words of application would have wound up&nbsp;the discourse in the usual way ; and these accordingly Æs-chines does not fail to insert ; but not till, with the sound&nbsp;of his own magnificent exorcism still ringing in his ears, he&nbsp;has marred everything by a tragic invocation of the earth&nbsp;and the sun, and virtue, and intelligence, and instruction,&nbsp;conceived in the very worst taste of Euripides, all but non</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">sensical in itself, misplaced in any oration, and in this a most humiliating spectacle of incorrect judgment degrading and&nbsp;disarming genius.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Every one knows what was the issue of the contest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ctesiphon was acquitted ; and his accuser, having failed in gaining the number of votes which would have protected the&nbsp;charge from being considered frivolous and malicious, was&nbsp;fined, and compelled to go into exile. We do not possess&nbsp;such materials as enable us to judge of the relative strength&nbsp;of the two factions among the numerous judges who pronounced this decision ; but the splendid oration of Demosthenes for the defence, now perused by us under every possible disadvantage, would tempt us to believe that, in an&nbsp;audience so volatile and susceptible as the Athenians, who&nbsp;were confessedly on many occasions impelled hither and&nbsp;thither by the orators at their will, even party-spirit may&nbsp;for once have been compelled to deny its own nature, and&nbsp;to become silent and impartial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The oration of Demosthenes, admirable though it be, will</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"> not call for a more minute analysis than that of Æschines ; both because it is better known and more generally accessible, and because its strain may in part be anticipated from&nbsp;the outline which has just been given. Many of its most&nbsp;striking beauties we must pass unnoticed, and we can but&nbsp;indicate one or two others ; such as the skill of insinuation&nbsp;throughout, with which the orator endeavours at once to&nbsp;kindle the feelings of his own party, and to conciliate those&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">of </span><span class="font1">the other ; the frequent felicity of illustration, as where&nbsp;he compares Æschines to a physician, who, after having&nbsp;watched his patient through a long sickness, propounds his&nbsp;remedies for the first time on the day of the funeral ; the&nbsp;fine sketches of character, like that noble one of Philip,&nbsp;crippled in every member of his body, but unsubdued in&nbsp;mind, and burning with the love of power and honour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Exordium is exceedingly skilful. After briefly claiming credit for good will, the speaker protests, with a very well acted indignation, against the attempt of his adversary&nbsp;to bind him to a particular order of topics, which, he asserts, the judges cannot countenance without violating their&nbsp;oath and every principle of justice : he then, after adverting&nbsp;to his own disadvantages, declares with artful earnestness,&nbsp;that the turn which Æschines had given to the accusation&nbsp;had, as he now found, put the character of Demosthenes&nbsp;himself distinctly in issue, forcing him, whether he would or&nbsp;not, to defend the whole tenor of his public life : he asserts&nbsp;peremptorily, that if Æschines had confined himself to the&nbsp;matters really suggested by the articles of impeachment, he,&nbsp;in the defence, would have entered at once on the question&nbsp;of the legality of the decree, but that he was now obliged&nbsp;to follow a different course in order to dispel unfounded&nbsp;prejudices : and he closes his introduction by insinuations&nbsp;against the accuser, both for his long delay in bringing the&nbsp;charge, and for the form in which it was at length presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He commences the body of the oration by intimating his intention to answer specifically each article of the charge,&nbsp;after he shall have premised a general view of the state of&nbsp;affairs when he first entered on political life. We cannot follow him through the details by which he redeems, or seems&nbsp;to redeem, this promise ; but two or three points may be selected as prominently instructive. Indignant denials of unproved charges are thrown out at the very commencement,&nbsp;and accompanied by that overwhelming strength of recrimination which is exerted in almost every page of the whole&nbsp;speech : again and again, from the very opening of the argument, he protests that his line of reasoning had been forced&nbsp;on him by his adversary ; and not till after he had endeavoured to destroy the whole credit of the accuser, by repeated and&nbsp;detailed charges of gross dishonesty and corruption, does he&nbsp;venture to approach the articles Of impeachment themselves.&nbsp;At length he recites them, and enters on his answer ; but, protesting once more against the accuser’s tactics, he professes&nbsp;himself compelled to defend, in the first place, that part of&nbsp;the decree which sets forth his own character, which </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font1">vindicates by a long and animated history. He then, with a&nbsp;contemptuous negligence of expression, intimates that there&nbsp;seems to be no other task left him, than to prove the strict&nbsp;legality of the decree, in favour of which he delivers an argument extending to about one twentieth part of the whole&nbsp;discourse. On this point, which was the one formally at&nbsp;issue, his defence is as lame as can well be conceived :&nbsp;Æschines, indeed, by his arguments in anticipation, had&nbsp;beaten away from beneath his feet all the ground on which&nbsp;he could have hoped to stand : one such plea, however, from&nbsp;the existence of a contradictory law, he does plausibly&nbsp;support ; and one unanticipated ground which he urges,&nbsp;intended as a denial of the fact, proves, on close examination, to amount nearly to this, that although he had not accounted when the decree was passed, he had done so before&nbsp;the accusation was brought, and his accounts had not been&nbsp;challenged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But the great orator, strong as was his faith in the legal inaptitude and factious prepossessions of the judges, dared&nbsp;not to close his case on such sophisms as this ; and accordingly, when he leaves the question as to the legality&nbsp;of the decree, never again to mention it, the oration is not&nbsp;quite half over. He immediately resumes his former detail of facts, grappling, however, more and more closely&nbsp;with Æschines, and following up every proof of his own&nbsp;patriotism and sagacity with a stinging contrast between&nbsp;his conduct and that of his enemy. Of the two points&nbsp;on which his argument was weakest, the one, his own personal courage, does not draw from him a single word ; but&nbsp;the other, the undeniable failure of the policy which he&nbsp;had advised, it behoved him to touch ; and as it was a matter in which, till some answer should be attempted, there&nbsp;might prevail in the minds of the audience a lurking conviction ruinous to Demosthenes and his cause, he summons up all his energies to dislodge the impression, introducing the subject boldly almost immediately after he&nbsp;had dismissed the legal argument, and disposing of it in one&nbsp;of his noblest appeals to national pride and the sense of honour. This magnificent passage of the speech is composed&nbsp;in the same lofty key in which we heard the orator closing&nbsp;the third Philippic : it rolls on in a mingled flood of rapid&nbsp;illustration, of proudly patriotic spirit, and of declarations&nbsp;of that love of freedom which must burn in Athens though&nbsp;all the world besides were dark ; and it is terminated by&nbsp;the tremendous oath, in which the brave who had died in&nbsp;battle for their country are called as witnesses to the truth&nbsp;of the principles which the speaker maintained. This most&nbsp;eloquent and celebrated passage is not an argument : it will&nbsp;bear no analysis as such ; but it is one of the most strongly&nbsp;felt and admirably wrought of all addresses to the feelings&nbsp;of national honour, pride, and independence.
