<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Valazé.</span><span class="font4"> &quot; Here is a letter of the late king to the biſhop oſ Clermont, with the anſwer of the latter, of&nbsp;the 16th of April 1791.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font4"> &quot; I diſown it.”</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h3><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Profdent.</span><span class="font1"> &quot; Do you not acknowledge your wri-ting and your ſignet ?”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font4"> I do not.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preofdent.</span><span class="font4"> &quot; The ſeal bears the arms of France.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font4"> &quot; Several perſons made uſe of that ſeal.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Valazé. </span><span class="font4">“ Do you acknowledge this liſt of ſums paid to Gilles ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Louis. </span><span class="font4">“ I do not.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Valazé. </span><span class="font4">“ Here is a memorandum for indemnify-ing the civil liſt for tlie military penſions ; a letter of Dufrefne St Leon, which relates to it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font4"> &quot; I know none of theſe pieces.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">when the whole liad been inveſtigated in this man-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ner, the preſident, addreffing the king, ſaid, &quot; I have no other queſtions to propofe—have you any thing&nbsp;more to add in your defence ?”—&quot; I deſire to have a&nbsp;copy of the accuſation (replied tlie king), and of the&nbsp;papers on whicli it is founded. I alſo deſire to have a&nbsp;counſel of my own nomination.” Barrere informed&nbsp;him, that his two firſt requeſts were already decreed,&nbsp;and that the determination reſpecting the other would&nbsp;be made known to him in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It would liave been an excefs of cruelty to refuſe a requeſt ſo reaſonable in itfelf ; it was therefore decreed&nbsp;that counſel ſhould be allowed to the king, and his&nbsp;choice fell upon M. M. Tronchet, Lamoignon Male-ſherbes, and Deſeze ; he liad previouſiy applied to M&nbsp;Target, who excuſed himſelf on account of his age and&nbsp;infirmity. On the 26th of December, the king appeared for the laſt time at the bar of the convention ;&nbsp;and M. Deſeze read a defence which the counfel liad&nbsp;prepared, and which was equally admired for tlie ſolidity of the argument and the beauty of the compoſition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">when the defence was ſiniſhed, the king aroſe, and holding a paper in his hand, pronounced in a calm manner, and with a ſirm voice, what follows : “ Citizens, you&nbsp;have heard my defence ; I now ſpeak to you, perhaps for&nbsp;the laſt time, and declare that my counſel have afferted&nbsp;nothing„to you but the truth ; my confcience reproaches&nbsp;me with nothing : 1 never was afraid of having my&nbsp;conduct inveſtigated ; but I obſerved with great uneaſi-neſs, that I was accuſed of giving orders for ſhedding&nbsp;the blood of the people on the 10th of Auguſt. The&nbsp;proofs I have given through my whole life of a contra-ry diſpoſition, I hoped would have ſaved me from ſucli&nbsp;an imputation, which I now ſolemnly declare is entire-ly groundleſs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The difcuffion was fatally cloſed on tlie 16th of Ja-nuary. After a fitting of near 34 hours, the puniſhment of death was awarded by a ſmall majority of the convention, and ſeveral of theſe differed in opinion from&nbsp;the reſt, reſpecting the time when it ſhould be inflicted;&nbsp;ſome contending that it ſhould not be put in execution&nbsp;till after the end of the war, while others propoſed to&nbsp;take tlie ſenſe of the people, by referring the ſentence&nbsp;to the primary affetnblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">M. Deſeze then ſolemnly invoked the aſſembly in the name of his colleagues, to conſider by what a ſmall&nbsp;majority tlie puniſhment of death was pronounced&nbsp;againſt the dethroned monarch. &quot; Do not afflict&nbsp;France (added this eloquent advocate) by a judgment&nbsp;that will appear terrible to her, when</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ſtve</span><span class="font3"> voices </span><span class="font4">only </span><span class="font3">were</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">VVT &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>J</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font4">prefnmed ſnfficient to carry it.” He appealed to eternal jnſtice, and ſacred humanity, to induce the convention&nbsp;to refer their ſentence to the tribunal of the people.&nbsp;“ You have either forgotten or deſtroyed (ſaid the ce-lebrated M. Tronchet) the lenity which the law allows&nbsp;to criminals, of requiring at leaſt </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">two-thirds</span><span class="font4"> of the voices&nbsp;to conſtitute a definitive judgment,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I'he ſentence was ordered to be executed in twenty-four hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The king and his family had been for ſome time kept ſeparate from each other ; but he was now allowed to ſee&nbsp;them, and to chooſe an eccleſiaſtic to attend him. The&nbsp;meeting, and, above all, the ſeparation from his family,&nbsp;was tender in the extreme. On Monday the 2iſt January, at eight o’clock in the morning, the unfortunate&nbsp;monarch was ſummoned to his fate. He afcended the&nbsp;ſcaſſold with a ſirm air and ſtep. Raiſing his voice,&nbsp;he ſaid, &quot; Frenchmen, I die innocent ; I pardon all my&nbsp;enemies; and may France”—at this inſtant the inhuman&nbsp;Santerre ordered the drums to beat, and the executioners to perform their office, when they offered to&nbsp;bind his hands, he ſtarted back as if about to refill ;&nbsp;but recollected himfelf in a moment, and ſubmitted.&nbsp;when the inſtrument of death deſcended, the prieſt exclaimed, &quot; Son of St Louis, afcend to heaven.” The&nbsp;bleeding head was held up, and a few of the populace&nbsp;ſhouted </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vive la République.</span><span class="font4"> His body was interred in&nbsp;a grave that was ſilled up with quicklime, aud a guard&nbsp;placed around till it ſhould be conſumed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ί hus fell Louis XVI. He poſſeſſed from nature a good underſtanding, which, however, was blunted by the early indulgences of a court. He had a&nbsp;ſtrong ſenſe of jnſtice, and his humanity was perhaps&nbsp;extreme. One defect rendered his virtues of little va-lue, whieh was the poſſeffion of an irreſolute and un-ſteady character. Unambitious, and eaſily adviſed, he&nbsp;was without difficulty induced to change his purpoſes,&nbsp;efpecially by his queen, whoſe connection with the&nbsp;houſe oſ Auſtria had always tended to render his coun-ſels unpopular, whether he was or was not connected&nbsp;with the foreign invaders of his country, poſterity muſt&nbsp;decide ; but all men of ſenſe and moderation muſt be&nbsp;convinced that he was murdered by a band of ruffians.&nbsp;Indeed a ſentence ſo infamous, and in all reſpects un-juſt, is not to be found in the records of hiſtory. The&nbsp;greater part of the charges brought againſt him werc&nbsp;trifling. Thoſe which ſeem to be of importance re-late to conduct authorized by the conſtitution under&nbsp;which he acted ; and that conſtitution declared his perſon inviolable. The fevereſt puniſhment that he could&nbsp;incur by law, was not death, but depoſition ; and there&nbsp;is no doubt, that in putting him to death the French&nbsp;nation broke the ſocial compact which their repreſen-tatives made with him. In a political view, this tragical event was injurious to the republican caufe throughout Europe. No man out of France ventured to juſti-fy it ; and in all countries it excited the moſt violent&nbsp;indignation againſt the rulers of tlie new republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">New enemies were now haſtening to join the general league againſt France, we do not mean here to enter&nbsp;into a detail of the political ſtruggles tliat occurred in&nbsp;any other country, than tliat in the narrative of whoſe&nbsp;revolution we are now engaged. It will therefore only&nbsp;be neceſſary to remark in general, that the Britiſh go-verment at this time thought itſelf endangered by the&nbsp;propagation of thoſe ſpeculative opinions which had</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
