        <p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROSAS, JUAN MANUEL </span><span
                class="font2">(1793-1877), tyrant of Buenos Aires, was born on the 30th of March
                1793, in the city of that name.&nbsp;His father, Leon Ortiz de Rosas, was an owner
                of cattle runs&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
                >(estancias)</span><span class="font2"> and a trader in hides, who took an active
                part in&nbsp;defeating the English attack on the city in 1807. Juan
                Rosas&nbsp;received so little education that he had to learn to read and&nbsp;write
                when he was already a married man and a successful cattle&nbsp;breeder. From a very
                early age he was left in charge of one&nbsp;of his father’s establishments. When he
                was eighteen he&nbsp;married Maria de la Encarnacion Eseurra. His mother
                having&nbsp;suspected him of appropriating money, he left his parents,&nbsp;and for
                some time subsisted by working as a </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">vaquero</span><span class="font2"> or cowboy,&nbsp;and
                then as overseer on the estates of other owners; but he&nbsp;accumulated money, and
                by the help of a loan from a friend he&nbsp;became possessed of a cattle run of his
                own, Los Cerrillos. The&nbsp;anarchical state of the country since its independence
                of Spain&nbsp;had favoured the Indians, who had taken the offensive and&nbsp;raided
                up to within forty miles of Buenos Aires. Rosas obtained leave to arm his cowboys.
                Under his management Los&nbsp;Cerrillos became a refuge for adventurers, whom he
                paid and fed&nbsp;well, but from whom he exacted implicit obedience.
                His&nbsp;followers became a fighting force of acknowledged efficiency,&nbsp;and
                Rosas took practically the position of an independent ruler&nbsp;whose help was
                sought by contending political parties. By&nbsp;attending to his own interest only,
                and by astute intrigue, or&nbsp;savage fighting when necessary, he grew in power
                from 1820&nbsp;onwards, and from 1835 to 1852 ruled as dictator
                (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;"
                >Argentina).</span><span class="font2"> It is probable that he would have
                continued&nbsp;to govern in Buenos Aires till his death if his ambition had
                not&nbsp;led him into wars with all his neighbours. He wished to extend&nbsp;the
                authority of the Republic over all the territory which had&nbsp;belonged to the
                Spanish viceroyalty of Buenos. This led him&nbsp;directly into wars with Uruguay,
                Paraguay and Chile, and into&nbsp;“ warlike operations ” with England and France,
                with whom&nbsp;he had other causes of quarrel arising out of the complaints&nbsp;of
                traders and bondholders. His government was overthrown&nbsp;in 1852 by a coalition
                of his neighbours and the defection of&nbsp;several of his generals, and even
                members of his own family&nbsp;who lived in fear of his suspicions and violence. He
                took refuge&nbsp;in England, and lived at Swaythling, near Southampton, till
                his&nbsp;death on the 14th of March 1877. A portrait taken in 1834&nbsp;and
                reproduced by Sir Woodbine Parish in his </span><span class="font2"

        <p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROSCELLINUS </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">(Rucelinus,</span><span class="font2"> or
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rousselin)
                (c.</span><span class="font2"> 1050-c. 1122), often called the founder of Nominalism
                (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;"
                >Scholasticism),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">was born at Compiègne (Compendium).
                Little is known of his&nbsp;life, and our knowledge of his doctrines is mainly
                derived from&nbsp;Anselm, Abelard and John of Salisbury. He studied at
                Soissons&nbsp;and Reims, was afterwards attached to the cathedral of
                Chartres,&nbsp;and became canon of Compiègne. It seems most probable
                that&nbsp;Roscellinus was not strictly the first to promulgate
                nominalistic&nbsp;doctrines; but in his exposition they received more
                definite&nbsp;expression, and, being applied to the dogma of the
                Trinity,&nbsp;attracted universal attention. Roscellinus maintained that it&nbsp;is
                merely a habit of speech which prevents our speaking of the&nbsp;three persons as
                three substances or three Gods. If it were&nbsp;otherwise, and the three persons
                were really one substance or&nbsp;thing </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">(una res),</span><span class="font2"> we should be forced
                to admit that the Father&nbsp;and the Holy Spirit became incarnate along with the
                Son.&nbsp;Roscellinus seems to have put forward this doctrine in perfect&nbsp;good
                faith, and to have claimed for it at first the authority&nbsp;of Lanfranc and
                Anselm. In 1092, however, a council convoked by the archbishop of Reims condemned
                his interpretation,&nbsp;and Roscellinus, who was in danger of being stoned to
                death&nbsp;by the orthodox populace, recanted his error. He fled to&nbsp;England,
                but having made himself unpopular by an attack&nbsp;on the doctrines of Anselm, he
                left the country and repaired to&nbsp;Rome, where he was well received and became
                reconciled to&nbsp;the Church. He then returned to France, taught at Tours
                and&nbsp;Loc-menaeh (Loches) in Brittany (where he had Abelard as a&nbsp;pupil), and
                finally became canon of Besançon. He is heard of&nbsp;as late as 1121, when he came
                forward to oppose Abelard’s&nbsp;views on the Trinity.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Of the writings of Roscellinus, nothing is preserved except a letter
                to Abelard, mainly concerned with the doctrine of the Trinity&nbsp;(ed. J. A.
                Sehmellcr, Munich, 1850). See F. Piearet, </span><span class="font2"

        <p><span class="font2">ROSCHER, WILHELM GEORG FRIEDRICH (1817-1894), German economist, was
                born at Hanover on the 21st of October&nbsp;1817. He studied at Göttingen and
                Berlin, and obtained a&nbsp;professorship at Gottingen in 1844 and subsequently at
                Leipzig&nbsp;in 1848. Omitting preparatory indications and undeveloped&nbsp;germs of
                doctrine, the origin of the “ historical ” school of&nbsp;political economy may be
                traced to Roscher. Its fundamental&nbsp;principles are dated, though with some
                hesitation, and with an&nbsp;unfortunate contrast of the historical with the
                philosophical&nbsp;method, in his </span><span class="font2"

                born, a slave, at Solonium, near Lanuvium. Endowed&nbsp;with a handsome faee and
                manly figure, he studied the delivery&nbsp;and gestures of the most distinguished
                advocates in the Forum,&nbsp;especially Q. Hortensius, and won universal praise for
                his grace&nbsp;and elegance on the stage. He especially excelled in
                comedy.&nbsp;Cicero took lessons from him. The two often engaged in&nbsp;friendly
                rivalry to try whether the orator or the actor could&nbsp;express a thought or
                emotion with the greater effect, and&nbsp;Roscius wrote a treatise in which he
                compared acting and&nbsp;oratory. Q. Lutatius Catulus composed a quatrain in
                his&nbsp;honour, and the dictator Sulla presented him with a gold ring,&nbsp;the
                badge of the equestrian order, a remarkable distinction for&nbsp;an actor in Rome,
                where the profession was held in contempt.&nbsp;Like his contemporary Aesopus,
                Roscius amassed a large&nbsp;fortune, and he appears to have retired from the stage
                some&nbsp;time before his death. In 76 </span><span class="font1"
