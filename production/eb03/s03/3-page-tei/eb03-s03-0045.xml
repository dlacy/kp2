This, I apprehend, denotes death at hand ; but this is rarely or never effected by the sun alone, without the addition of that poiſonous wind which purſued us through Atbara, where it has, no doubt, contributed to the total extinction of every thing that hath the breath of life. A thermometer, graduated upon this ſcale, would exhibit a figure very different from the common one ; for I am convinced by experiment, that a web of the fineſt muffin, wrapt round the body at Sennaar, will occasion at raid-day a greater ſenſation of heat in the body, than a riſe of 5 degrees in the thermometer of Fahrenheit.</p><p>“At Sennaar, from 70 to 78 degrees of Fahrenheit’s thermometer is cool ; from 79 to 92 temperate ; at 92 degrees begins warmth. Although the degree of the thermometer marks a greater heat than is felt by the body of us ſtrangers, it ſeems to me that the ſenſations of the natives bear ſtill a leſs proportion to that degree than ours On the 2d of Auguſt, while I was lying perfectly enervated on a carpet in a room deluged with water at 12 o’clock, the thermometer at 116, I ſaw ſeveral black labourers pulling down a houſe, working with great vigour, without any ſymptoms of being incommoded.”</p><p>The dreſs of the people of Sennaar conſiſts only of a long ſhirt of blue cloth, which wraps them up from the under part of the neck to the feet. It does not, however, conceal the neck in the men, though it does in the women. The men ſometimes have a ſaſh tied about their middle ; and both men and women go barefooted in the houſes, whatever their rank may be. The floors of their apartments, eſpecially thoſe of the women, are covered with Perſian carpets. Both men and women anoint themselves, at leaſt once a-day, with camel’s greaſe mixed with civet, which, they imagine, ſoftens their ſkins, and preſerves them from cutaneous eruptions ; of which they are ſo fearful, that they confine themſelves to the houſe if they obſerve the ſmalleſt pimple on their ſkins. With the same view of preserving their ſkins, though they have a clean ſhirt every day, they ſleep with a greaſed one at night, having no other covering but this. Their bed is a tanned bull’s hide, which this constant greaſing ſoſtens very much ; it is alſo very cool, though it gives a ſmell to their bodies from which they cannot be freed by any waſhing.</p><p>Our author gives a very curious deſcription of the queens and ladies of the court at Sennaar. He had acceſs to them as a phyſician, and was permitted to pay his viſit alone. He was firſt ſhown into a large ſquare apartment, where there were about 50 black women, all quite naked excepting a very narrow piece of cotton rag about their waiſts. As he was musing whether theſe were all queens, one of them took him by the hand, and led him into another apartment much better lighted than the former. Here he ſaw three women fitting upon a bench or ſofa covered with blue Surat cloth ; they themſelves being clothed from the neck to the feet with cotton ſhirts of the same colour. Theſe were three of the king’s wives ; his favourite, who was one of the number, appeared to be about six feet high, and ſo corpulent that our traveller imagined her to be the largeſt creature he had ſeen next to the elephant and rhinoceros. Her features perfectly reſembled thoſe of a negro: a ring of gold paſſed through her under lip, and weighed it down, till, like a flap, it covered her chin, leaving her teeth bare, which were ſmall and very fine. The inſide of her lip was made black with antimony. Her ears reached down to her ſhoulders, and had the appearance of wings : there was a gold ring in each of them about five inches in diameter, and somewhat smaller than a man’s little finger; the weight of which had drawn down the hole where her ear was pierced ſo much that three fingers might eaſily paſs above the ring. She had a gold necklace like that called E<hi rend="italic">ſclavage,</hi> of ſeveral rows, one below another ; to which were hung rows of ſequins pierced. She had two manacles of gold upon her ancles larger than thoſe uſed for chaining felons. Our author could not imagine how it was poſſible for her to walk with them, till he was informed that they were hollow. The others were dreſſed much in the same manner ; only there was one who had chains coming from her ears to the outſide of each noſtril, where they were faſtened. A ring was alſo put through the griſtle of her noſe, and which hung down to the opening of her mouth; having all together ſomething of the appearance of a horſe’s bridle ; and Mr Bruce thinks that ſhe muſt have breathed with difficulty.</p><p>The poorer sort of the people of Sennar Jive upon the flour or bread of millet ; the rich make puddings of this, toaſting the flour before the fire, and putting milk and butter into it ; beſides which they uſe beef partly roaſted and partly raw. They have very fine and fat horned cattle, but the meat commonly fold in the market is camel’s fleſh. The liver and ſpare rib of this animal are always eaten raw ; nor did our author ſee one inſtance to the contrary all the time he was in the country. Hog’s fleſh is not ſold in the market ; but all the common people of Sennaar eat it openly ; thoſe in office, who pretend to be Mahometans, doing the ſame in ſecret.</p><p>There are no manufactures in this country, and the principal article of trade is blue Surat cloth. In former times, when caravans could paſs with ſafety, Indian goods were brought in quantities from Jidda to Sennaar, and then diſperſed over the country of the blacks. The returns were made in gold, a powder called <hi rend="italic">Tibbar, </hi>civet, rhinocerotes horns, ivory, oſtrich feathers, and above all ſtaves or glaſs, more of theſe being exported from Sennaar than from all the Eaſt of Africa. This trade, however, as well as that of the gold and ivory, is almoſt deſtroyed ; though the gold is ſtill reputed to be the beſt and pureſt in Africa, and is therefore bought at Mocha to be carried to India, where it all centres at last.</p><p>SENNERTUS (Daniel), an eminent phyſician, was born in 1572 at Breſlaw ; and in 1593 he was ſent to Wittemberg, where he made great progreſs in philosophy and phyſic. He visited the univerſities of Leipſic, Jena, Francfort upon the Oder, and Berlin ; but soon returned to Wittemberg, where he was promoted to the degree of doctor of phyſic, and soon after to a profeſſorſhip in the ſame faculty. He was the firſt who introduced the ſtudy of chemiſtry into that univerſity ; he gained a great reputation by his works and practice, and was very generous to the poor. He died of the plague at Wittemberg, in 1637. He railed himſelf</p></body></text></TEI>
