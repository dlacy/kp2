<p><label>ROCHEFORT</label>
a handſome and conſiderable town of France in the territory of Aunis. It was conſtructed by Louis XIV. and is built in the midſt of marſhes expreſsly drained for that purpoſe ; and time evinced the utility of the project, for as a port it ſoon became as neceſſary and important to the crown of France as Breſt or Toulon. It has a department of the marine, and has large magazines of naval ſtores. There is alſo one of the ſineſt halls of arms in the kingdom, and a great many workmen employed in making them ; there are alſo forges for anchors, and work-houſes for ſhip-carpenters, who are employed in every thing that relates to the fitting out of ſhips that come within the compaſs of their province. They likewiſe call great guns here ; and have artiſts, whoſe employment is ſculpture and painting. There are alſo ſtocks for building men of war, rope-walks, magazines of proviſions and powder, a manufactory of fail-cloth, an hoſpital for ſailors, and proper places to clean the ſhips. Add to theſe, the houſes of the intendant, the ſquare of the capuchins, and the ſuperb ſtructure which contains lodgings for 300 marine guards, where they are taught the buſineſs and exerciſes belonging to ſeamen and officers who go on board the men of war.</p><p>Beſide the uſual number of workmen which were employed at Rochefort during the monarchy, which amounted to about 900, there were about 600 galley ſlaves, occupied in the moſt painful and laborious branches of ſervice. The town is ſituated on the river Charente, about five leagues from its mouth, and was fortified by Louis XIV. at the time he conſtructed it ; but its ſituation is at ſo conſiderable a diſtance from the ſea, as to render it ſufficiently ſecure from any attack, and they have therefore cloſed up the battlements, and neglected the fortifications. The town is laid out with great beauty and elegance. The ſtreets are all very broad and ſtraight, extending through the v hole place from ſide to ſide ; but the buildings do not correſpond with them in this reſpect, as they are moſtly low and irregular. W. Long. 0. 54. N. Lat. 46. 3.</p>
