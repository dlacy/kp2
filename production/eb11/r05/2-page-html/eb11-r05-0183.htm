<p><span class="font0">RUSSO-TURKISH WARS (1828-29 and 1877-78). The earlier wars between Russia and Turkey possess little military interest&nbsp;to-day, and arc scarcely remembered except as the occasion of&nbsp;Suvarov’s exploits. The first of the three 19th-century (1806-1812) wars, however, though much less vigorously fought than&nbsp;the preceding wars, at any rate introduced the “ Eastern question ” into European politics as a factor affecting the balance&nbsp;of power, and its cessation at the moment of Napoleon’s advance&nbsp;on Moscow had a great effect on the emperor’s Russian campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The second war is more celebrated. It was a reflex of the Greek War of Independence, and began with the invasion of&nbsp;Rumania by the Russians in May 1828. One corps invested&nbsp;and took Braila, another passed by Bucharest and besieged&nbsp;Rustchuk and Silistria, and a third crossed the Danube below&nbsp;Isacka. The first and the last were united as an army under&nbsp;the tsar and advanced through the Dobrudja on Shumla. But&nbsp;after a considerable amount of fighting it was decided that&nbsp;the Turks here were too strong for the invaders, and the tsar&nbsp;drew off his forces by degrees towards Varna, which was&nbsp;besieged next. But the Shumla troops were thus gradually&nbsp;set free to join the Turkish field army under the grand vizier,&nbsp;which, however, merely menaced, without seriously attacking,&nbsp;the besiegers of Varna. The place surrendered on the 10th of&nbsp;October 1828, and the tsar at once turned upon the grand&nbsp;vizier, attacked him on the river Kamchik (15th October) and&nbsp;forced him to retreat to Aidos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meantime, however, Silistria offered a gallant resistance. Even when the besiegers were reinforced from the main army&nbsp;they could not master the defence, and when winter came on&nbsp;the siege was abandoned, and the Russians drew off into&nbsp;Rumania into winter quarters. In Asia, meanwhile, a Russian&nbsp;army under Prince Paskievich had advanced from Tiflis, and&nbsp;captured Kars and other places, while the Black Sea fleet&nbsp;secured the surrender of Poti. Paskievich next defeated the&nbsp;Turks at Akhalzik (27th August), captured Ardahan, and&nbsp;advanced by Bayazid to the upper Euphrates. But coming&nbsp;there into conflict with the fierce Kurds, he gave up further&nbsp;enterprises and, leaving garrisons in the strong places,. took&nbsp;his army back into the Caucasus for the winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1829 Diebitsch took over the command of the 70,000 men on the Danube, and resolved to carry the war over the&nbsp;Balkans. As a preliminary the fleet seized Sozopolis (Sisepol).&nbsp;A second and vigorously pressed siege of Silistria ended with&nbsp;the surrender of the place on June 30th, the Turkish operations&nbsp;for the expulsion of the Sozopolis garrison and the relief of&nbsp;Silistria being dilatory as before. The Turkish army was at&nbsp;this time in process of reorganization on a European model,&nbsp;which added to the difficulties of their situation. The grand&nbsp;vizier, Reschid Mehmet, in May attempted to combine the&nbsp;Rustchuk and Shumla garrisons for the expulsion of the&nbsp;Russians from Varna, but unsuccessfully, the two columns being&nbsp;beaten in detail. Soon afterwards Diebitsch, with part of the&nbsp;army investing Silistria, marched against him and defeated&nbsp;him at Tcherkovna (nth June). Immediately after this&nbsp;Diebitsch carried out the brilliant passage of the Balkans and&nbsp;advanced to Adrianople, which laid Constantinople at his mercy,&nbsp;and brought about an immediate peace. A month after its&nbsp;signature, a Turkish army from the west, attempting to recapture Adrianople behind Diebitsch, was defeated on the&nbsp;16th October at Arnaut Kaliessi. In Asia, meantime, Paskievich, after relieving Akhalzik, where his garrison had been&nbsp;blockaded, won two victories on two successive days at Kainly&nbsp;and Milli Duzov (1st and 2nd June), and captured a number of&nbsp;fortresses, his victorious advance being arrested only by the&nbsp;terms of peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(X.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The War of 1877-78.</span><span class="font0">—On 24th April 1877, the tsar declared war against Turkey, with the avowed object of righting the&nbsp;wrongs of the Christians in Turkey. The Turco-Servian war&nbsp;was just over. Contrary to expectation the Turks had proved&nbsp;victorious. Hostilities had ceased in October 1876, though it&nbsp;was not till 1st March 1877 that peace had been signed. During&nbsp;1876 the Turks had also quelled an insurrection of the Christians&nbsp;in Bulgaria, when the treatment they meted out to the Christians and the cry of “ Bulgarian atrocities ” had aroused the&nbsp;sentimental sympathies of Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Danube formed the Turkish frontier. Flowing west to cast along the southern boundary of Rumania, it turned to&nbsp;the north and then to the east to the Black Sea, enclosing the&nbsp;Dobrudja, an inhospitable and difficult region, of rectangular&nbsp;shape, some 100 m. N. to S. by 30 to 60 m. E. to W., which&nbsp;was the extreme northern part of the Turkish dominions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Russians did not anticipate that the opposition to be encountered from the Turkish forces would be of a serious&nbsp;nature. As for natural obstacles, there were the Danube and&nbsp;the Balkans directly across their route, but the passage of these&nbsp;was not likely to cause any serious delay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Turkish fortresses of the Quadrilateral—Rustchuk, Silistria, Shumla and Varna—could be avoided, and Nikopol&nbsp;and Vidin were more or less isolated. It would only be&nbsp;necessary to cover the lines of communication from the action&nbsp;of the garrisons of these places. It was known that Osman&nbsp;Pasha was at Vidin with what remained of the Turkish force&nbsp;which had defeated the Servians the previous year, and it would&nbsp;be necessary to detach a force to operate against him. There&nbsp;would be some delay in the forwarding of supplies, due to the&nbsp;fact that the Rumanian railway was of different gauge to the&nbsp;railways of Russia, but this would not be serious. This line,&nbsp;the only railway through Rumania, ran from Galatz to Bucharest, where one branch ran west by Slatina and the other to&nbsp;Giurgevo on the Danube, where it connected with a line south&nbsp;of the river from Rustchuk to Shumla and Varna through&nbsp;Rasgrad. It was generally imagined that the advance to&nbsp;Constantinople would be of the nature of a triumphal march.&nbsp;By a clause of the Treaty of Paris of 1856 the Russian naval&nbsp;forces in the Black Sea had been destroyed, and though this&nbsp;clause was revoked in 1871, in 1877 the Turks possessed the&nbsp;undoubted command of the sea. Had things been different,&nbsp;an advance through the Dobrudja, with a safe line of supply&nbsp;by water, would have offered many advantages. Under&nbsp;existing circumstances, with Turkish gunboats on the Danube&nbsp;and ironclads on the Black Sea, such a course was out of the&nbsp;question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The plan of campaign formed by the Russians was as follows: One corps was to enter the Dobrudja to protect the line of&nbsp;communication against any Turkish advance east of&nbsp;the Danube, while the remainder would cross the&nbsp;Danube between Rustchuk and Nikopol, cross the&nbsp;Balkans and advance on Adrianople. Detached forces would&nbsp;meanwhile mask the “ Quadrilateral ” and the Turkish force&nbsp;at Vidin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A Convention had been made with Rumania, allowing the passage of the Russians through the country. The Rumanians&nbsp;proclaimed their independence of Turkey, and although the&nbsp;tsar declined their offer of active co-operation for the time&nbsp;being, their troops occupied Calafat, facing Vidin, and early&nbsp;in May their batteries engaged the guns of Vidin across the&nbsp;river. The Russian army with which it was proposed to carry'&nbsp;on the war, consisted of six army corps and two rifle brigades.&nbsp;Each corps was formed of one cavalry and two infan try divisions.&nbsp;There were in addition 74 squadrons and 52 guns of Cossacks.&nbsp;Each infantry division had 48, and each cavalry division 12&nbsp;guns. This force bad been mobilized in the November of the&nbsp;previous year, and was now distributed as follows:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Commander-in-chief: The grand-duke Nicholas, with headquarters at Kishinev.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">VII. Army Corps .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. Odessa and.Tatar Bunar.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The mobilization of the IV., XIII., and XIV. Army Corps had been ordered in December 1876, but they would not be&nbsp;ready to move till the following month—May 1877. In</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
