an ancient and conſiderable town of Denmark, and capital of a duchy of the ſame name in the province of Gottorp, with a biſhop’s ſee, ſecularized in 1586. Cloſe to it is the old palace of Gottorp, formerly the ducal residence, but at preſent inhabited by the ſtadtholder or governor. This town was once much more conſiderable than it is at preſent, having ſuffered greatly by the wars of Germany. It is ſeated on the gulph of Sley, where there is a good harbour, 60 miles north-west of Lubeck, and 125 ſouth-weſt of Copenhagen. E. Long. 10. 0. N. Lat. 54. 40.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sleswick,</hi> the duchy of, or <hi rend="italic">South Jutland,</hi> is about 100 miles in length and 60 in breadth. It is bounded on the north by North Jutland, on the eaſt by the Baltic Sea, on the ſouth by Holſtein, and on the weſt by</p><p>the ocean. It contains 14 cities, 17 towns, 13 caſtſes, 278 pariſhee, 1480 villages, 162 farms, 116 water mills, and 106 gentlemens ſeats. It is a pleaſant, fertile, populous country, and a ſovereign duchy. Formerly the king of Denmark had half of it, and the other belonged to the houſe of Holſtein-Gottorp ; but the former having conquered this duchy, had the poſſeſſion of it confirmed to him by the treaty of the north in 1720. In 1731, a prince of Bareith-Culmbach was made governor of this duchy, who reſides at Gottorp.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
