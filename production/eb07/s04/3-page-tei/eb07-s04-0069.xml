In the north, Bilboa and Santander, in the south, Seville and Cadiz, are the great entrepôts for the exportation of wool, which is also spun and manufactured into cloth in Catalonia and Barcelona. These manufactures, however, are by no means sufficient for the inhabitants, and almost every species of manufacture is import ed. In Catalonia there are numerous manufactories of coarse cloth, which enjoy a monopoly ; coarse cloths of fo reign manufacture being almost prohibited by a heavy tax. The finest cloth is manufactured in Valencia, and the trade is in a flourishing state, employing nearly 10,000 hands. Tanning is the most active branch of manufacture in the northern provinces. Potteries are numerous, but the articles produced are generally of an inferior description. There is a royal porcelain manufactory at Madrid, the produce of which is very superior, but it costs the government more than it returns. Hat and paper manufactories have also been established, and have met with considerable success. The manufacture of arms forms a part of the trade of Spain, but the quantity made is by no means great. There are two large factories in Biscay ; at Abaceti and Toledo swords are made ; at Segovia, firearms ; and at this latter place, as well as at Seville and Placencia, there are good founderies. Seville carries on a considerable trade in leather, a species of which, prepared with gall-nuts, is in much request. Ferrol and Vittoria possess considerable tanneries ; and the former has an establishment where varnished leather is made. Iron manufactories are very numerous in Biscay, but none of them is conducted on an extensive scale. In almost every village in this province some kind of iron ware is manufactured ; horseshoes, fusils, locks, and bedsteads being the chief articles, which are sent to the interior. Cast iron utensils are prohibited from being imported into Spain ; but this regulation does not seem to be attended with any great advantage, for there is only one smelting manufactory at Bilboa. Several other iron manufactories have been established throughout the country, the principal being at Pederoza and Martulla in Andalusia; but it does not appear that they have met with any degree of success. Iron ore is prohibited from being exported, but considerable quantities are nevertheless sent to France. Manufactures are much checked in Spain by the system of monopoly, several of the largest manufactories being in the hands of the government, and consequently ill conducted.</p><p>The commerce consists chiefly in the exporting of wines, wool, brandy, fruits, silk raw and manufactured, lead, iron, mercury, barilla, and a few other articles, amounting in all, according to a government return in 1826, to the value of L.1,584,000. Iron, in bars, is exported in considerable quantities from Bilboa, Cumana, and Vittoria, chiefly to Bayonne and Bordeaux. Malaga and Alicant wines are also important branches of commerce ; and the coarse wines of Murviedro are extensively exported. The export of dried fruits gives activity to the ports of Alicant, Malaga, Seville, and Valencia ; and the latter town is famous for its dyes. The imports of Spain consist of sugar, salt fish, spices, wood, rice, butter, cheese, hides, wool, and cotton, and al most every manufactured article. The transport of salt from Cadiz and Torrevieju, for the fisheries of Galicia, is an important branch of commerce, and, along with the fisheries themselves, employs a great number of hands, producing the best sailors, and giving activity to the towns and villages on the coast, which is seldom seen in the interior. The net produce of commerce and manufactures was estimated by Miñano in 1826 at L.l4,660,000. It is difficult to arrive at any correct estimate of the value of the ex ports and imports of Spain, from the want of official documents ; and even when these are obtained, little reliance can be placed on them.

There are no substitutes for cash in ordinary transactions, bills of exchange being principally used ; but these do not pass from hand to hand as cash, except by special arrangement. The difficulty of transmitting specie is the cause of these bills being much used ; merchants preferring rather to pay a premium than run the risk of losing the specie altogether. The rate of exchange of course varies with the supply of bills in the market, and also with the character of the houses offering the paper. Most of the bills are at short dates, generally within one month. Some are as short as two days ; and these are allowed eight days’ grace, unless the word <hi rend="italic">fixed </hi>is written on them. Interest generally varies from three to four and a half per cent. on discounting bills, but this mode of negotiation is not much practised. Interest on mercan tile transactions is understood to be fixed at six per cent., and three per cent. on mortgages ; but the law is easily evaded, there being no penalty inflicted on those who charge more than the legal interest. There are no bankers with whom money can be lodged ; and it is customary for people rather to horde up their money than to run the risk of its being lost in the hands of merchants.</p><p>In internal communication, Spain lies under great dis advantages, both from the mountainous nature of the coun try, and the obstructed navigation of the rivers. In the hands of an enterprising people, these difficulties might soon be overcome. The roads and canals are not numerous, and, if we except the principal highways, are but imperfectly kept. The two roads which run from Madrid to Burgos, the one through Valladolid, and the other through Aranda de Douro, are kept in good condition ; but the great eastern roads are</p></body></text></TEI>
