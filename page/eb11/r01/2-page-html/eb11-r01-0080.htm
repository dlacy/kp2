The resistance of&nbsp;goods wagons has not been so systematically investigated. In the&nbsp;paper above quoted Aspinall cites a case where the resistance of a&nbsp;train of empty wagons 1830 ft. long was 18∙33 ℔ per ton at a speed&nbsp;of 26 m. per hour, and a train of full wagons 1045 ft. long gave only&nbsp;9·12 ℔ per ton at a speed of 29 m. per hour. The resistance found&nbsp;from the above expressions includes the components 1</span><span class="font0">, </span><span class="font1">2 and 4 of&nbsp;§ 4. The resistance caused by the wind is very variable, and in&nbsp;extreme cases may double the resistance found from the formulae.&nbsp;A side wind causes excessive flange friction on the leeward side of&nbsp;the train, and increases the tractive resistances therefore very&nbsp;considerably, even though its velocity be relatively moderate.&nbsp;The curves corresponding to the above expressions are plotted in&nbsp;fig. 17, four values of L being taken for formula (12) corresponding&nbsp;to trains of 5, 10, 15 and 20 bogie carriages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The resistance at starting is greater than the running resistance at moderate speeds. From Aspinall's experiments it appears to&nbsp;be about 17 ℔ per ton, and this value is plotted on the diagram.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The resistance to motion round a curve has not been so systematically studied that any definite rule can be formulated applicable to all classes of rolling stock and all radii of curves. A general result&nbsp;could not be obtained, even from a large number of experiments,&nbsp;because the resistance round curves depends upon so many variable&nbsp;factors. In some cases the gauge is laid a little wider than the&nbsp;standard, and there are varying amounts of superelevation of the&nbsp;outer rail; but the most formidable factor in the production of resistance is the guard-rail, which is sometimes put in with the object&nbsp;of guiding the wheel which runs on the inner rail of the curve on&nbsp;the inside of the flange.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">§ 6. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Engine Resistance. —</span><span class="font1">From experiments made on the North-Eastern railway (see a paper by W. H. Smith on “ Express Locomotive Engines, ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Proc. Inst. Meeh. Eng.,</span><span class="font1"> October 1898), it appeared that the engine resistance was about 35 % of the total resistance,&nbsp;and in the train-resistance experiments on the Lancashire &amp;&nbsp;Yorkshire railway quoted above the engine  resistance was also&nbsp;about 35 % of the total resistance, thus confirming the North-Eastern&nbsp;railway results. Barbier </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(loc. cit. )</span><span class="font1"> gives as the formula for the&nbsp;engine resistance</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">r<sub>c</sub>=8∙51+3∙24S(1∙61S+30) ∕ 1000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(17)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">where S is the speed in miles per hour. This formula is valid between speeds of 37 and 77 m. per hour, and was obtained in connexion&nbsp;with the experiments previously quoted on the Northern railway&nbsp;of France with an engine and tender weighing about 83 tons.&nbsp;Barbier's formula is plotted in fig. 17, together with a curve expressing&nbsp;generally the results of some early experiments on the Great Western&nbsp;railway carried out by Sir D. Gooch. The extension of the Barbier&nbsp;curve beyond the above limits in fig. 17 gives values which must be&nbsp;regarded as only very approximate.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">the weight of the vehicles are respectively given, the rate at which work must be done in the engine cylinders in order to maintain the&nbsp;train in motion at a stated speed can be computed by the aid of&nbsp;the curves plotted in fig. 17. Thus let an engine and tender weighing&nbsp;80 tons haul vehicles weighing 200 tons at a uniform speed on the&nbsp;level of 40 m. per hour. As given by the Barbier curves in fig. 17,&nbsp;the engine resistance at 40 m. per hour is 20 ℔ per ton, and the&nbsp;vehicle resistance 8·5 ℔ per ton at the same speed.

Thus a gradient of 1 in 200 is the&nbsp;same as a half per cent. grade or a rise of 26·4 ft. per mile. The&nbsp;difference between the horizontal distance and the distance measured&nbsp;along the rail is so small that it is negligible in all practical calculations. Hence if a train is travelling up the gradient at a speed of&nbsp;V ft. per second, the vertical rise per second is V/G ft.

This is lost in heat&nbsp;produced by the friction between the brake blocks and the wheels,&nbsp;though in some systems of electric driving some of the energy&nbsp;stored in the train may be returned to the central station during&nbsp;retardation.
