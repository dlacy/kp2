in theology, what a man does beyond his duty, or more than he is commanded to do. The Romanists stand up strenuouſly for works of ſupererogation, and maintain that the obſervance of evangelical councils is ſuch. By means hereof, a stock of merit is laid up, which the church has the diſpoſal of, and which ſhe diſtributes in indulgences to ſuch as need.</p><p>This abſurd doctrine was firſt invented towards the cloſe of the 12th century, and modified and embelliſhed by St Thomas in the 13th: according to which, it was pretended that there actually exiſted an immenſe treaſure of merit, compoſed of the pious deeds and virtuous actions which the saints had performed beyond what was neceſſary for their own ſalvation, and which were therefore applicable to the benefit of others ; that the guardian and diſpenſer of this precious treaſure was the Roman pontiff ; and that of consequence he was empowered to assign to ſuch as he thought proper a portion of this inexhauſtible ſource of merit, ſuitable to their reſpective guilt, and ſufficient to deliver them from the puniſhment due to their crimes.</p><p>The reformed church do not allow of any work of ſupererogation ; but hold with the apoſtles, that when we have done our beſt, we are but unprofitable ſervants.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
