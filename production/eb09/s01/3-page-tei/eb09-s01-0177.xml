Giovanni degli Schiavoni·, and, finest of all, the church of S. Geminiano, near St Mark’s, a very good specimen of the Tuscan and Composite orders used with the graceful freedom of the Renaissance.</p><p>The otherwise prosperous course of the artist’s life was interrupted by one serious misfortune. In 1545 the roof of the public library, which he was then constructing, gave way and fell in; on account of this he was imprisoned, fined, and dismissed from the office of chief architect of the cathedral, to which he had been appointed by a decree of the signoria on April 7, 1529. Owing, however, to the intervention of his friends, Titian, Pietro Aretino, and others, he was soon set at liberty, and in 1549 he was restored to his post. He did good service to the cathedral of St Mark’s by strengthening its failing domes, which he did by encircling them with bands of iron. Sansovino’s architectural works have much beauty of proportion and grace of ornament, a little marred in some cases by an excess of sculptured decoration, though the carving itself is always beautiful both in design and execution. He used the classic orders with great freedom and tasteful invention—very different from the dull scholasticism of most of his contemporaries. His numerous pupils were mostly men of but little talent.</p><p>SANTA ANNA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Antonio Lopez de</hi> (1798-1876), for many years a prominent figure in the troubled politics of Mexico, was born at Jalapa on February 21, 1798, Having entered the army, he joined the party of <hi rend="smallcaps">Iturbide </hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> in 1821, and gained distinction and promotion by the part he took in the surprise and capture of Vera Cruz. In the following year he quarrelled with his chief and himself became leader of a party, but without in the first instance achieving success. In 1828, however, he sided with Guerrero, who made him war minister, and also commander-in-chief after a successful operation against the Spaniards in 1829. He successively accomplished the overthrow of Guerrero in favour of Bustamante and of Bustamante in favour of Pedraza, and finally in March 1833 was himself elected president. In 1836 he was defeated and taken by the Texan revolutionists, but returned to Mexico the following year. In 1844, after considerable vicissitudes, he was deposed and banished, but he was brought back once more to the presidential chair in 1846. This second term of office lasted till the fall of Mexico in 1847, when he resigned. He was made president again in 1853, but finally abdicated in 1855. In 1867 he took part in “ pronunciamientos ” which led to his banishment. In 1874 he was permitted to return to his native soil, where he died two years afterwards.</p><p>SANTA CRUZ.

It is the seat of the governor, the bishop, and the legislature, and contains a cathedral, a Jesuits’ church (1654) and college (the latter an important institution with 400 boarders), a new bishop’s palace, a town-hall (with a fine tower), extensive infantry barracks, and a large market. A foundry, a macaroni-factory, oil-factories, and tile-works are the chief industrial establishments. The population in 1881 was 10,400, a decrease since 1869. Santa Fé was founded in 1573 by Juan de Garay.</p><p>SANTA FE, a city of the United States, capital of New Mexico, stands in a wide plain surrounded by moun</p><p>tains about 7000 feet above the sea, in 35° 41' N. lat. and</p><p>105° 46' W. long., near the Santa Fé Creek, which joins the Rio Grande del Norte 14 or 15 miles farther southwest. It is connected by a branch line (18 miles) with the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fé Railroad at Lamy Junction, 835 miles from Atchison. The houses are mainly constructed of adobe, and the irregularity of the plan shows how recently the city has come under the influence of “ American ” progress. Among the more noteworthy buildings are the new capitol, for which funds were voted in 1883, the Roman Catholic cathedral, erected since 1870, and the old governor’s palace, a long low edifice occupying one side of the principal <hi rend="italic">plaza,</hi> which now contains a soldiers’ monument in honour of those who fell in the service of the United States. Santa Fé is an important centre of trade, and the development of the mining industries in the vicinity is rapidly increasing its prosperity. The population was 6635 in 1881.</p><p>One of the oldest cities of North America, Santa Fé de San Francisco was the capital of New Mexico from 1640, but remained in comparative seclusion till the early part of the present century, when it became a main station on what was called the Santa Fé Trail—the trade route between the United States and Mexico, or more especially between St Louis and Chihuahua. A custom-house was established in the city in 1821, and the first American mercantile house began business in 1826. By 1843 the value of the merchandise entrusted to the train of 230 waggons from St Louis was $450,000. General Kearny built Fort Marcy at Santa Fé in 1846, and in 1851 the city became the capital of the new Territory. In 1862 it was occupied for a few days by the Confederates.</p><p>SANTA FÉ DE BOGOTA. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Bogota.</hi></p><p>SANTAL PARGANAS, <hi rend="smallcaps">The,</hi> a British district in the lieutenant-governorship of Bengal, forming the southern portion of the Bhágalpur division, and lying between 23° 48' and 25° 19' N. lat., and between 86° 30' and 87° 58' E. long. The total area of the district is 5456 square miles; it is bounded on the north by the districts of Bhágalpur and Purniah, on the east by Maldah, Murshidabad, and Bírbhúm, on the south by Bardwán and Mánbhúm, and on the west by Hazáribagli and Bhágalpur. Three distinct types of country are represented within the area of the Santál Parganás : in the east a sharply defined belt of hills stretches for about a hundred miles from the Ganges to the Naubil River; west of this point a rolling tract of long ridges with intervening depressions covers an area of about 2500 square miles; while the third type is exemplified by a narrow strip of flat alluvial country about 170 miles long, lying for the most part along the loop line of the East Indian Railway. The Rajmahal Hills are the only range of any importance in the district, and occupy an area of 1366 square miles; but they nowhere exceed 2000 feet in height. Several other hill ranges occur, which are with few exceptions covered almost to their summits with dense jungle; they are all difficult of access; there are, however, numerous passes through all the ranges. Coal and iron are found in almost all parts of the country, but the coal is of such inferior quality that all attempts to work it have failed. Wild animals, including tigers, leopards, bears, hyaenas, deer, and wild pig, with a variety of small game, are common almost everywhere. The climate varies: the alluvial tract has the damp heat and moist soil characteristic of Bengal, while the undulating and hilly portions are swept by the hot westerly winds of Behar, and are very cool in the winter months. The average annual rainfall is over 50 inches. The district is traversed on the east by the loop line, and on the west by the chord line, of the East Indian Railway; the total length of railway is about 130 miles.</p><p>The census of 1881 disclosed a total population in the Santal Parganás of 1,568,093 (males 785,330, females 782,763) ; Hindus numbered 847,590, Mohammedans 108,899, and Christians 3057. The total number of persons belonging to the aboriginal tribes was 605,517, of whom the great majority (537,546) were Santáls.</p></body></text></TEI>
