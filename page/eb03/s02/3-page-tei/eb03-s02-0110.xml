            <p>and read to the people every ſeventh year@@(D). Sufficient care therefore was taken
                not only for the preſervation of the original record, but that no ſpurious
                production ſhould be ſubſtituted in its ſtead. And that no ſpurious production ever
                has been ſubſtituted in the ſtead of the original compoſition of Moſes, appears from
                the evidence both of the Greek and the Samaritan Pentateuch. For as theſe agree with
                the Hebrew, except in ſome trifling variations @@<hi rend="smallcaps">(e),</hi> to
                which every work is expoſed by length of time, it is abſolutely certain that the
                five books which we now aſcribe to Moſes are one and the ſame work with that which
                was tranſlated into Greek in the time of the Ptolemies, and, what is of ſtill
                greater importance, with that which exiſted in the time of Solomon. And as the Jews
                could have had no motive whatſoever, during that period which elapſed between the
                age <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Joſhua and that of Solomon, for ſubſtituting a
                ſpurious production inſtead of the original as written by Moſes, and, even had they
                been inclined to attempt the impoſture, would have been prevented by the care which
                had been taken by their lawgiver, we muſt conclude that our preſent Pentateuch is
                the very identical work that was delivered by Moſes.</p>
            <p>The poſitive evidence being now produced, we ſhall endeavour to anſwer ſome
                particular objections that have been urged. But as moſt of theſe occur in the book
                of Geneſis, we ſhall reſerve them for ſeparate examination, and ſhall here only
                conſider the objections peculiar to the four laſt books. They may be compriſed under
                one head, viz. expreſſions and paffages in theſe books which could not have been
                written by Moſes. I. The account of the death of Moſes, in the laſt chapter of
                Deuteronomy, we allow muſt have been added by ſome ſucceeding writer; but this can
                never prove that the book of Deuteronomy is ſpurious. What is more common among
                ourſelves than to ſee an account of the life and death of an author ſubjoined to his
                works, without informing us by whom the narrative was written? 2. It has been
                objected, that Moſes always ſpeaks of himſelf in the third perſon. This is the
                objection of fooliſh ignorance, and therefore ſcarcely deferves an anſwer. We
                ſuſpect that ſuch perſons have never read the claſſics, particularly Caeſar’s
                Commentaries, where the author uniformly ſpeaks of himſelf in the third perſon, as
                every writer of correct taſte will do who reflects on the abſurdity of employing the
                pronoun of the ſirſt perſon in a work intended to be read long after his death. (See
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Grammar,</hi> n⁰ 33.) 3. As to the objection, that in ſome
                places the text is defective, as in Exodus xv. 8. it is not directed againſt the
                author, but againſt ſome tranſcriber; for what is wanting in the Hebrew is inſerted
                in the Samaritan. 4. The only other objection that deſerves notice is made from two
                paſſages. It is ſaid in one place that the bed of Og is at Ramah <hi rend="italic"
                    >to this day; </hi>and in another (Deut. iii. 14.), “Jair the ſon of Manaſſeh
                took all the country of Argob unto the coaſts of Geſhuri and Maacathi, and called
                them after his own name, Baſhan-havoth-jair, <hi rend="italic">unto this day.”</hi>
                The laſt clauſe in both theſe paſſages could not have been written by Moſes, but it
                was probably placed in the margin by ſome tranſcriber by way of explanation, and was
                afterwards by miſtake inſerted in the text. Whoever doubts the truth of this
                aſſertion may have recourſe to the manuſcripts of the Greek Teſtament, and he will
                find that the ſpurious additions in the texts of ſome manuſcripts are actually
                written in the margin of others @@<hi rend="smallcaps">(f).</hi></p>
            <p>That the Pentateuch, therefore, at leaſt the four laſt books of it, was written by
                Moſes, we have very ſatisfactory evidence; which, indeed, at the diſtance of 3000
                years is wonderful, and which cannot be affirmed of any profane biſtory written at a
                much later period.</p>
            <p>The book of Geneſis was evidently not written by a perſon who was contemporary with
                the facts which he records; for it contains the hiſtory of 2369 years, a period
                comprehending almoſt twice as many years as all the reſt of the hiſtorical books of
                the Old Teſtament put together. Moſes has been acknowledged as the author of this
                book by all the ancient Jews and Chriſtians; but it has been a matter of diſpute
                from what ſource he derived his materials; ſome affirming that all the facts were
                revealed by inſpiration, and others maintaining that he procured them from
                tradition.</p>
            <p>Some who have looked upon themſelves as profound philoſophere, have rejected many
                parts of the book of Geneſis as fabulous and abſurd: but it cannot be the wiſdom of
                philoſophy, but the vanity of ignorance, that could lead to ſuch an opinion. In
                fact, the book of Geneſis affords a key to many difficulties in philoſophy which
                cannot otherwiſe be explained. It has been ſuppoſcd that the diverſities among
                mankind prove that they are not deſcended ſrom one pair; but it has been</p>

                all the elders of Iſrael. And Moſes commanded them, ſaying, At the end of every

                margin; and in one of the manuſcripts which Beza used, this marginal addition has
                been obtruded in the text. See his note on this paſſage. 2. Another inſtance is, I

                found its way not only into the Codex Covelli 2, but into the Coptic and Ethiopic
