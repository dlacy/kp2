            <p>plants; and in the natural method ranking with thoſe of which the order is doubtful.
                The calyx is quadrifid; there is no corolla; the berry is monoſpermous; and the ſeed
                covered with an antlus or looſe coat.</p>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">SALVAGE-money,</hi> a reward allowed by the civil and ſtatute
                law for the ſaving of ſhips or goods from the danger of the ſea, pirates, or
                enemies. —Where any ſhip is in danger of being ſtranded, or driven on ſhore,
                juſtices of the peace are to command the conſtables to aſſemble as many perſons as
                are neceſſary to preſerve it; and, on its being preſerved by their means, the
                perſons aſſiſting therein ſhall, in 30 days after, be paid a reaſonable reward for
                their ſalvage; otherwiſe the ſhip or goods ſhall remain in the cuſtody of the
                officers of the cuſtoms as a ſecurity for the ſame.</p>
            <p>SALVATION, means the ſafety or preſervation of any thing which is or has been in
                danger, and is generally uſed in a religious ſenſe, when it means preſervation from
                eternal death, or reception to the happineſs of heaven, which is now offered to all
                men by the Chriſtian religion upon certain conditions. The Hebrews but rarely make
                uſe of concrete terms as they are called, but often of abſtracted. Thus, inſtead of
                faying that God ſaves them and protects them, they ſay that God is their ſalvation.
                Thus the word of ſalvation, the joy of ſalvation, the rock of ſalvation, the ſhield
                of ſalvation, the horn of ſalvation, &amp;c<hi rend="italic">.</hi> is as much as to
                ſay, The word that declares deliverance; the joy that attends the eſcaping a great
                danger, a rock where any one takes refuge, and where he may be in ſafety from his
                enemy; a buckler, that ſecures him from the arm of the enemy; a horn or ray of
                light, of happineſs and ſalvation, &amp;c. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Theology,

            <p>SALVE <hi rend="smallcaps">regina,</hi> among the Romaniſts, the name of a Latin
                prayer, addreſſed to the Virgin, and ſung after complines, as alſo upon the point of
                executing a criminal. Durandus ſays, it was compoſed by Peter biſhop of Compoſtella.
                The cuſtom of ſinging the <hi rend="italic">ſalve regina</hi> at the cloſe of the
                office was begun by order of St Dominic, and firſt in the congregation of Dominicans
                at Bologna, about 1237. Gregory IX. firſt appointed it to be general. St Bernard
                added the concluſion, <hi rend="italic">O duſcis! O pia,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>SALVIA, <hi rend="smallcaps">sage:</hi> A genus of the monogynia order; belonging to
                the digynia claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 42d order,
                    <hi rend="italic">Verticillatae. </hi>The corolla is unequal; and the filaments
                placed croſswiſe on a pedicle. The moſt remarkable ſpecies are,</p>
            <p> 1. The officinalis, or common large ſage, which is cultivated in gardens; of which
                there are the following varieties: 1. The common green ſage; 2. The wormwood ſage.
                3. The green ſage, with a variegated leaf. 4. The red ſage. 5. The red ſage with a
                variegated leaf. Theſe are accidental variations, and therefore are not enumerated
                as ſpecies. The common ſage grows naturally in the ſouthern parts of Europe, but is
                here cultivated in gardens for uſe; but that variety with red or blackiſh leaves is
                the moſt common in the Britiſh gardens; and the wormwood ſage is in greater plenty
                here than the common green-leaved ſage, which is but in few gardens.</p>
            <p> 2. The tomentoſa, generally titled <hi rend="italic">balſamic ſage</hi> by the
                gardeners. The ſtalks of this do not grow ſo upright as, thoſe of the common ſage;
                they are very hairy, and divide into ſeveral branches, which are garniſhed with
                broad heart-ſhaped woolly leaves ſtanding upon long foot-ſtalks; they are ſawed on
                their edges, and their upper ſurfaces are rough: the leaves, which are upon the
                flower-ſtalks, are oblong and oval, ſtanding upon ſhorter foot ſtalks, and are very
                ſlightly ſawed on their edges; they grow in whorled ſpikes toward the top of the
                branches; the whorls are pretty far diſtant, but few flowers in each; they are of a
                pale blue, about the ſize of thoſe of the common fort. This ſage is preferred to all
                the others for making tea.</p>
            <p> 3. The auriculata, common ſage of virtue, which is alſo well known in the gardens
                and markets. The leaves of this is narrower than thoſe of the common fort; they are
                hoary, and ſome of them are indented on their edges towards the baſe, which
                indentures have the appearance of ears. The ſpikes of flowers are longer than thoſe
                of the two former ſorts, and the whorls are generally naked, having no leaves
                between them. The flowers are ſmaller, and of a deeper blue than thoſe of common red
                ſage.</p>
            <p> 4. The pomifera, with ſpear-ſhaped oval entire leaves, grow naturally in Crete. This
                hath a ſhrubby ſtalk, which riſes four or five feet high, dividing into ſeveral
                branches. The flowers grow in ſpikes at the end of the branches; they are of a pale
                blue colour, and have obtuſe empalements. The branches of this ſage have often
                punctures made in them by infects, at which places grow large protuberances as big
                as apples, in the ſame manner as the galls upon an oak, and the rough balls on the
                briar.</p>
            <p>All the ſorts of ſage may be propagated by ſeeds, if they can be procured; but, as
                ſome of them do not perfect their ſeeds in this country, and moſt of the ſorts, but
                eſpecially the common kinds for uſe, are eaſily propagated by flips, it is not worth
                while to raiſe them from ſeeds.</p>
            <p>SALVIANUS, an ancient father of the Chriſtian church, who flouriſhed in the 5th
                century, and was well ſkilled in the ſciences. It is ſaid he lived in continence
                with his wife Palladia, as if ſhe had been his ſiſter; and that he was ſo afflicted
                at the wickedneſs of that age, that he was called the <hi rend="italic">Jeremiah of
                    the fifth century.</hi></p>
            <p>He acquired ſuch reputation for his piety and learning, that he was named the <hi
                    rend="italic">master of the biſhop</hi>s<hi rend="italic">.</hi> He wrote a
                Treatiſe on Providence; another on Avarice; and ſome epiſtles, of which Baluze has
                given an excellent edition; that of Conrad Ritterſhufius, in 2 vols octavo, is alſo
                eſteemed.</p>
            <p>SALUTATION, the act of ſaluting, greeting, or paying reſpect and reverence to any
                one.</p>
            <p>When men (writes the compiler of<hi rend="italic"> L'Eſprit des Curioſities of
                    Literature, Ufages et des Coutumes)</hi> ſalute each other in an amicable
                manner, it ſigniſies little whether they move a particular part of the body, or
                practiſe a particular ceremony. In theſe actions there muſt exiſt different cuſtoms.
                Every nation imagines it employs the moſt reaſonable ones; but all are equally
                ſimple, and none are to be treated as ridiculous. This infinite number of ceremonies
                may be reduced to two kinds; to reverences or ſalutations; and to the touch of ſome
                part of the human body. To bend and proſtrate one’s ſelf to expreſs ſentiments of
                reſpect, appears to be a natural motion; for terrified perſons throw themſelves on
                the earth when they adore inviſiible beings. The affectionate touch of</p>
