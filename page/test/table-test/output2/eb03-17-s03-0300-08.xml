That represented on Plate CCCCXLIX. and copied from Edwards, came from the iſland of Barbadoes ; and was ſaid to have been taken out of an egg of the ſize of a ſmall pullet’s egg by a man who found it under-ground as he was digging. The heads were not in an horizontal poſition when the ſnake lay on its belly, but inclined to each other on their under-ſides, leaving an opening for the throat to come in between the two heads underneath, as is expreſſed at A. The upper-ſide, for the whole length, was covered with ſmall scales, falling one over another ; the, belly was covered with ſingle scales running acroſs it, in the form of half rings. Tt was all over of a yellowiſh colour, without any ſpots or variation. Mr Edwards alſo informs us, that a perſon brought to him a common Engliſh ſnake, which had two heads quite ſeparate from each other, the necks parting about an inch from the head.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Serpens,</hi> <hi rend="italic">Serpent,</hi> in the Linnæan ſyſtem of zoology, an order of animals belonging to the claſs of <hi rend="italic">amphibia,</hi> and comprehending six genera, viz. the <hi rend="italic">crotalus,</hi> or rattle-ſnake ; the <hi rend="italic">boa,</hi> including ten ſpecies ; the <hi rend="italic">coluber,</hi> or viper; the <hi rend="italic">anguis,</hi> or ſnake : the amphisbaena <hi rend="italic">,</hi> or annulated ſnake, the body and tail of which are compoſed of annular ſegments ; and the <hi rend="italic">caecilia,</hi> or tentaculated snake, the body and tail of which are wrinkled, without scales, and the upper part furniſhed with two feelers ; and including two ſpecies. See an account of theſe genera under their reſpective names.</p><p>The characters of ſerpents, according to Linnæus, are theſe : They are amphibious animals, breathing through the mouth by means of kings only ; having a tapering body, no diſtinct neck ; the jaws not articulated, but dilatable, and deſtitute of feet, fins, and ears.</p><p>The ſerpent has from the beginning been the enemy of man; and it has hitherto continued to terrify and annoy him, notwithſtanding all the arts which have been practiſed to deſtroy it. Formidable in itſelf, it deters the invader from the purſuit ; and from its figure, capable of finding ſhelter in a little ſpace, it is not easily diſcovered by thoſe who would venture to encounter it. Thus poſſeſſed at once of potent arms, and inacceſſible or ſecure retreats, it baffles all the<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0307.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0301"/>
arts of man, though ever ſo earneſtly bent upon its deſtruction. For this reaſon, there is ſcarce a country in the world that does not ſtill give birth to this poiſonous brood, that ſeems formed to quell human pride, and repreſs the boaſts of ſecurity. Mankind have driven the lion, the tiger, and the wolf, from their vicinity ; but the ſnake and the viper ſtill defy their power.</p><p>Their numbers, however, are thinned by human aſſiduity ; and it is poſſible ſome of the kinds are wholly deſtroyed. In none of the countries of Europe are they ſufficiently numerous to be truly terrible. The various malignity that has been aſcribed to European ſerpents of old is now utterly unknown ; there are not above three or four kinds that are dangerous, and their poiſon operates in all in the same manner. The drowſy death, the ſtarting of the blood from every pore, the inſatiable and burning thirſt, the melting down the ſolid maſs of the whole form into one heap of putrefaction, ſaid to be occaſioned by the bites of African ſerpents, are horrors with which we are entirely unacquainted.</p><p>But though we have thus reduced theſe dangers, having been incapable of wholly removing them, in other parts of the world they ſtill rage with all their ancient malignity. In the warm countries that lie within the tropics, as well as in the cold regions of the north, where the inhabitants are few, the ſerpents propagate in equal proportion. But of all countries those regions have them in the greateſt abundance where the fields are unpeopled and fertile, and where the climate ſupplies warmth and humidity. All along the ſwampy banks of the river Niger or Oroonoko, where the ſun is hot, the foreſts thick, and the men but few, the ſerpents cling among the branches of the trees in infinite numbers, and carry on an unceaſing war againſt all other animals in their vicinity. Travellers have aſſured us, that they have often ſeen large ſnakes twining round the trunk of a tall tree, encompaſſing it like a wreath, and thus riſing and deſcending at pleaſure.— We are not, therefore, to reject as wholly fabulous the accounts left us by the ancients of the terrible devaſtations committed by a ſingle ſerpent. It is probable, in early times, when the arts were little known, and mankind were but thinly ſcattered over the earth, that ſerpents, continuing undiſturbed poſſeſſors of the foreſt, grew to an amazing magnitude ; and every other tribe of animals fell before them. It then might have happened, that ſerpents reigned the tyrants of a diſtrict for centuries together. To animals of this kind, grown by time and rapacity to 100 or 150 feet in length, the lion, the tiger, and even the elephant itſelf, were but feeble opponents. That horrible foetor, which even the commoneſt and the most harmleſs ſnakes are ſtill found to diffuſe, might, in theſe larger ones, become too powerful for any living being to withſtand ; and while they preyed without diſtinction, they might thus alſo have poiſoned the atmosphere around them. In this manner, having for ages lived in the hidden and unpeopled foreſt, and finding, as their appetites were more powerful, the quantity of their prey decreaſing, it is poſſible they might venture boldly from their retreats into the more cultivated parts of the country, and carry conſternation among mankind, as they had before desolation among the lower ranks of nature. We have many histories of antiquity, preſenting us ſuch a pic</p><p>ture, and exhibiting a whole nation sinking under the ravages of a ſingle ſerpent. At that time man had not learned the art of uniting the efforts of many to effect one great purpoſe. Oppoſing multitudes only added new victims to the general calamity, and increaſed mutual embarraſſment and terror. The animal was therefore to be ſingly oppoſed by him who had the greateſt ſtrength, the beſt armour, and the moſt undaunted courage. In ſuch an encounter, hundreds muſt have fallen ; till one, more lucky than the rest, by a fortunate blow, or by taking the monſter in its torpid interval, and ſurcharged with ſpoil, might kill, and thus rid his country of the destroyer. Such was the original occupation of heroes ; and thoſe who firſt obtained that name, from their deſtroying the ravagers of the earth, gained it much more deſervedly than their ſucceſſors, who acquired their reputation only for their ſkill in deſtroying each other. But as we deſcend into more enlightened antiquity, we find theſe animals leſs formidable, as being attacked in a more ſucceſsful manner. We are told, that while Regulus led his army along the banks of the river Bagrada in Africa, an enormous ſerpent disputed his paſſage over. We are aſſured by Pliny, that it was 120 feet long, and that it had deſtroyed many of the army. At laſt, however, the battering engines were brought out againſt it ; and theſe aſſailing it at a diſtance, it was ſoon deſtroyed. Its ſpoils were carried to Rome, and the general was decreed an ovation for his ſucceſs. There are, perhaps, few facts better aſcertained in hiſtory than this : an ovation was a remarkable honour ; and was given only for ſome signal exploit that did not deserve a triumph : no hiſtorian would offer to invent that part of the ſtory at leaſt, without being ſubject to the moſt ſhameful detection. The ſkin was kept for ſeveral years after in the Capitol ; and Pliny ſays he ſaw it there. At preſent, indeed, ſuch ravages from ſerpents are ſcarce ſeen in any part of the world ; not but that, in Africa and America, ſome of them are powerful enough to brave the aſſaults of men to this day.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Nequent expleri corda tuendo Terribiles oculos villosaque ſetis pectore.</hi></p><p>If we take a ſurvey of ſerpents in general, they have marks by which they are diſtinguiſhed from all the reſt of animated nature. They have the length and the ſuppleneſs of the eel, but want fins to ſwim with ; they have the ſcaly covering and pointed tail of the lizard, but they want legs to walk with ; they have the crawling motion of the worm, but, unlike that animal, they have lungs to breathe with : like all the reptile kind, they are reſentful when offended ; and nature has ſupplied them with terrible arms to revenge every injury.</p><p>Though they are poſſeſſed of very different degrees of malignity, yet they are all formidable to man, and have a ſtrong similitude of form to each other. With reſpect to their conformation, all ſerpents have a very wide mouth in proportion to the size of the head ; and, what is very extraordinary, they can gape and ſwallow the head of another animal which is three times as big as their own. However, it is noway ſurpriſing that the ſkin of the ſnake ſhould ſtretch to receive ſo large a morſel ; the wonder ſeems how the jaws could take it<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0308.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0302"/>
in. To explain this, it muſt be obſerved, that the jaws of this animal do not open as ours, in the manner of a pair of hinges, where bones are applied to bones, and play upon one another ; on the contrary, the ſerpent’s jaws are held together at the roots by a ſtretching muscular ſkin ; by which means they open as widely as the animal chooſes to ſtretch them, and admit of a prey much thicker than the snake's own body. The throat, like ſtretching leather, dilates to admit the morſel ; the ſtomach receives it in part, and the rest remains in the gullet, till putrefaction and the juices of the ſerpent’s body unite to diſſolve it.</p><p>Some ſerpents have fangs or canine teeth, and others are without them. The teeth in all are crooked and hollow ; and, by a peculiar contrivance, are capable of being erected or depreſſed at pleaſure.</p><p>The eyes of all ſerpents are ſmall, if compared to the length of the body ; and though differently co- loured in different kinds, yet the appearance of all is malign and heavy ; and, from their known qualities, they ſtrike the imagination with' the idea of a creature meditating miſehief. In ſome, the upper eyelid is wanting, and the ſerpent winks only with that below,; in others, the animal has a nictitating membrane or ſkin, reſembling that which is found in birds, which keeps the eye clean and preſerves the fight. The ſubstance of the eye in all is hard and horny ; the cryſtaline humour occupying a great part of the globe.</p><p>The holes for hearing are very viſible in all : but there are no conduits for ſmelling ; though it is probable that ſome of them enjoy that ſenſe in tolerable perfection.</p><p>The tongue in all theſe animals is long and forky. It is compoſed of two long fleſhy ſubſtances, which terminate in ſharp points, and are very pliable. At the root it is connected very ſtrongly to the neck by two tendons, that give it a variety of play. Some of the viper kind have tongues a fifth part of the length of their bodies ; they are continually darting them out ; but they are entirely harmleſs, and only terrify thoſe who are ignorant of the real ſituation of their poiſon.</p><p>If from the jaws we go on to the gullet, we ſhall find it very wide for the animal’s ſize, and capable of being diſtended to a great degree ; at the bottom of this lies the ſtomach, which is not ſo capacious, and receives only a part of the prey, while the reſt continues in the gullet for digeſtion. When the ſubſtance in the ſtomach is dissolved into chyle, it passes into the inteſtines, and from thence goes to nouriſhment, or to be excluded by the vent.</p><p>Like moſt other animals, ſerpents are furniſhed with lungs, which we ſuppoſe are ſerviceable in breathing, though we cannot perceive the manner in which this operation is performed ; for though ſerpents are often ſeen apparently to draw in their breath, yet we cannot find the ſmalleit ſigns of their ever reſpiring it again. Their lungs, however, are long and large, and doubtleſs are neceſſary to promote their languid circulation. The heart is formed as in the tortoiſe, the frog, and the lizard kinds, ſo as to work without the aſſiſtance of the lungs. It is single ; the greatest part of the blood flowing ſrom the great vein to the great artery by the ſhorteſt courſe. By this contrivance of nature we eaſily gather two conſequences; that ſnakes are amphibious, being equally capable of living on land and in the water; and that alſo they are torpid in winter, like the bat, the lizard, and other animals formed in the ſame manner.</p><p>The vent in theſe animals ſerves for the emiſſion of the urine and the faeces, and for the purpoſes of generation. The infiniment of generation in the male is double, being forked like the tongue : the ovaries in the female are double alſo ; and the aperture is very large, in order to receive the double infiniment of the male. They copulate in their retreats ; and it is ſaid by the ancients, that in this ſituation they appear like one ſerpent with two heads.</p><p>As the body of this animal is long, slender, and capable of bending in every direction, the number of joints in the back-bone are numerous beyond what one would imagine. In the generality of quadrupeds, they amount to not above 30 or 40 ; in the ſerpent kind they amount to 145 from the head to the vent, and 25 more from that to the tail. The number of theſe joints muſt give the back-bone a ſurpriſing degree oſ pliancy ; but this is still increaſed by the manner in which each of theſe joints are locked into the other. In man and quadrupeds, the flat ſurfaces of the bones are laid one against the other, and bound tight by ſinews ; but in ſerpents, the bones play one within the other like ball and ſocket, ſo that they have full motion upon each other in every direction.</p><p>Though the number of joints in the back bone is great, yet that of the ribs is ſtill greater ; for, from the head to the vent, there are two ribs to every joint, which makes their number 290 in all. Theſe ribs are furniſhed with muſcles, four in number ; which being inſerted into the head, run along to the end of the tail, and give the animal great ſtrength and agility in all its motions.</p><p>The ſkin alſo contributes to its motions, being compoſed of a number of ſcales, united to each other by a tranſparent membrane, which grows harder as it grows older, until the animal changes, which is generally done twice a-year. This cover then bursts near the head, and the ſerpent creeps from it by an undulatary motion, in a new ſkin, much more vivid than the former. If the old ſlough be then viewed, every scale will be diſtinctly ſeen like a piece of net-work, and wall be found greateſt where the part of the body they covered was largest.</p><p>There is much geometrical neatneſs in the diſpoſal of the ſerpent’s ſcales, for aſſiſting the animal’s ſinuous motion. As the edges of the ſoremoſt ſcales lie over the ends of their following ſcales, ſo thoſe edges, whcn the ſcales are erected, which the animal has a power of doing in a ſmall degree, catch in the ground, like the nails in the wheel of a chariot, and ſo promote and facilitate the animal’s progreſſive motion. The erecting theſe ſcales is by means of a multitude of diſtinct muſcles with which each is ſupplied, and one end of which is tacked each to the middle of the foregoing.</p><p>In ſome of the ſerpent kind there is the exacteſt ſymmetry in theſe ſcales ; in others they are difpoſed more irregularly. In ſome there are larger ſcales on the belly, and often answering to the number of ribs ; in others, however, the animal is without them, Upon this flight difference, Linnaeus has founded his diſtinctions of the various claſſes of the ſerpent tribe.</p><p>When we come to compare ſerpents with each other,<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0309.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0303"/>
the firſt great diſtinction appears in their size ; no other tribe of animals differing ſo widely in this particular. This tribe of animals, like that of fiſhes, ſeems to have no bounds put to their growth : their bones are in a great meaſure cartilaginous, and they are consequently capable of great extenſion : the older, therefore, a ſerpent becomes, the larger it grows ; and as they ſeem to live to a great age, they arrive at an enormous ſize.</p><p>Leguat aſſures us, that he ſaw one in Java that was 50 ſeet long. Carli mentions their growing to above 40 feet ; and we have now the skin of one in the Britiſh Muſaeum that meaſures 32. Mr Wentworth, who had large concerns in the Berbices in America, aſſures us, that in that country they grow to an enormous length. He one day ſent out a ſoldier, with an Indian, to kill wild-fowl for the table ; and they accordingly went ſome miles from the fort : in purſuing their game, the Indian, who generally marched before, beginning to tire, went to reſt himſelf upon the fallen trunk of a tree, as he ſuppoſed it to be ; but when he was juſt going to sit down, the enormous monſter began to move ; and the poor ſavage perceiving that he had approached a <hi rend="italic">bon,</hi> the greateſt of all the ſerpent kind, dropped down in an agony. The ſoldier, who perceived at ſome diſtance what had happened, levelled at the ſerpent’s head, and by a lucky aim ſhot it dead : however, he continued his fire until he was aſſured that the animal was killed ; and then going up to reſcue his companion, who was fallen motionleſs by its side, he, to his aſtoniſhment, found him dead likewiſe, being killed by the fright. Upon his return to the fort, and telling what had happened, Mr Wentworth ordered the animal to be brought up, when it was meaſured, and found to be 36 feet long. He had the ſkin fluffed, and then ſent to Europe as a preſent to the prince of Orange, in whoſe cabinet it was lately to be ſeen at the Hague : but the ſkin is ſhrunk, by drying, two or three feet. In the Eaſt Indies they grow alſo to an enormous ſize, particularly in the iſland of Java, where, we are aſſured, that one of them will deſtroy and devour a buffalo. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Boa.</hi></p><p>But it is happy for mankind that the rapacity of theſe frightful creatures is often their puniſhment ; for whenever any of the ſerpent kind Rave gorged themſelves in this manner, whenever their body is ſeen particularly diſtended with food, they then become torpid, and may be approached and deſtroyed with ſafety. Patient of hunger to a ſurpriſing degree, whenever they ſeize and ſwallow their prey, they ſeem, like ſurfeited gluttons, unwieldy, ſtupid, helpleſs, and ſleepy : they at that time ſeek ſome retreat, where they may lurk ſor ſeveral days together, and digeſt their meal in ſafety : the ſmalleſt effort at that time is capable of deſtroying them ; they can ſcarce make any reſiſtance ; and they are equally unqualified for flight or oppoſition : that is the happy opportunity of attacking them with succeſs; at that time the naked Indian himſelf does not fear to assail them. But it is otherwiſe when this ſleepy interval of digeſtion is over ; they then iſſue, with famiſhed appetites, from their retreats, and with accumulated terrors, while every animal of the foreſt flies before them.</p><p>But though theſe animals are of all others the most voracious, and though the morſel which they ſwallow without chewing, is greater than what any other creature, either by land or water, can devour ; yet no ant. mals upon earth bear abſtinence so long as they. A ſingle meal, with many of the ſnake kind, ſeems to be the adventure of a ſeaſon ; it is an occurrence, of which they have been for weeks, nay ſometimes for months, in patient expectation. When they have ſeized their prey, their induſtry for ſeveral weeks is entirely diſcontinued ; the fortunate capture of an hour often ſatisfies them for the remaining period of their annual activity, As their blood is colder than that of moſt other terrestrial animals, and as it circulates but ſlowly through their bodies, ſo their powers of digeſtion are but feeble. Their prey continues, for a long time, partly in the stomach, partly in the gullet, and is often ſeen in part hanging out of the mouth. In this manner it digeſts by degrees ; and in proportion as the part below is disſolved, the part above is taken in. It is not therefore till this tedious operation is entirely performed, that the ſerpent renews its appetite and its activity. But ſhould any accident prevent it from iſſuing once more from its cell, it ſtill can continue to bear famine for weeks, months, nay ſor years together. Vipers<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>[m] See Abstinence.</p></note> * are often kept in boxes ſor six or eight months, without any food whatever ; and there are little ſerpents ſometimes ſent over to Europe from Grand Cairo, that live for ſeveral years in glaſſes, and never eat at all, nor even ſtain the glaſs with their excrements.</p><p>Other creatures have a choice in their proviſion : but the ſerpent indiſcriminately preys upon all ; the buffalo, the tiger, and the gazelle. One would think that the porcupine’s quills might be ſufficient to protect it ; but whatever has life serves to appeaſe the hunger of theſe devouring creatures : porcupines, with all their quills, have frequently been found in their ſtomachs when killed and opened ; nay, they moſt frequently are ſeen to devour each other.</p><p>A life of ſavage hoſtility in the foreſt offers the imagination one of the moſt tremendous pictures in nature. In thoſe burning countries, where the ſun dries up every brook for hundreds of miles round ; when what had the appearance of a great river in the rainy ſeaſon, becomes, in ſummer, one dreary bed of sand ; in thoſe countries, a lake that is never dry, or a brook that is perennial—is conſidered by every animal as the greateſt convenience of nature. When they have diſcovered this, no dangers can deter them from attempting to flake their thirſt. Thus the neighbourhood of a rivulet, in the heart of the tropical continents, is generally the place where all the hoſtile tribes of nature draw up for the engagement. On the banks of this little envied ſpot, thouſands of animals of various kinds are ſeen venturing to quench their thirſt, or preparing to ſeize their prey. The elephants are perceived in a long line, marching from the darker parts of the foreſt ; the buffaloes are there, depending upon numbers for ſecurity ; the gazelles relying ſolely upon their ſwiſtneſs ; the lion and tiger waiting a proper opportunity to ſeize ; but chiefly the larger ſerpents are upon guard there, and defend the acceſſes of the lake. Not an hour passes without ſome dreadful combat ; but the ſerpent, defended by its ſcales, and naturally capable of ſuſtaining a multitude of wounds, is, of all others, the moſt formidable. It is the moſt wakeful alſo ; ſor the whole tribe ſleep with their eyes open, and are conſequently for ever upon the watch : ſo that, till their rapacity is satisfied,<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0310.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0304"/>
<hi rend="italic">few</hi> other animals will venture to approach their ſtation.</p><p>In comparing ſerpents as to their voices, ſome are found silent, ſome have a peculiar cry ; but hiſſing is the found which they moſt commonly send forth, either as a call to their kind, or as a threat to their enemies. In the countries where they abound, they are generally silent in the middle of the day, when they are obliged to retire from the heat of the climate ; but as the cool of the evening approaches, they are then heard iſſuing from their cells with continued hiſſings ; and ſuch is the variety of their notes, that ſome have aſſured us they very much reſemble the muſic of an Engliſh grove. This ſome will hardly credit ; at any rate, ſuch notes, however melodious, can give but very little delight, when we call to mind the malignity of the minſtrel. If conſidered, indeed, as they anſwer the animal’s own occaſions, they will be found well adapted to its nature, and fully anſwering the purpoſes of terrifying ſuch as would venture to offend it.</p><p>With reſpect to motion, ſome ſerpents, particularly thoſe of the viper kind, move ſlowly ; while others dart with amazing ſwiftneſs. The motion in all is ſimilar ; but the ſtrength of body in ſome gives a very different appearance. The viper, that is but a flow feeble-bodied animal, makes way in a heavy undulating manner ; advancing its head, then drawing up its tail behind, and bending the body into a bow ; then from the ſpot where the head and tail were united, advancing the head forward as before. This, which is the motion of all ſerpents, is very different from that of the earth-worm or the naked ſnail. The ſerpent, as was ſaid above, has a back-bone, with numerous joints; and this bone the animal has a power of bending in every direction, but without being able to ſhorten or lengthen it at pleaſure. The earth-worm, on the other hand, has no back-bone ; but its body is compoſed of rings, which, like a barber’s puff, it can lengthen or ſhorten as it finds neceſſary. The earth-worm, therefore, in order to move forward, lengthens the body ; then by the fore part clings to the ground where it has reached, and then contracts and brings up its rear : then, when the body is thus ſhortened, the fore-part is lengthened again for another progreſſion, and ſo on. The ſerpent, inſtead of ſhortening the body, bends it into an arch ; and this is the principal difference between ſerpentine and vermicular progreſſion.</p><p>We have inſtanced this motion in the viper, as moſt eaſily diſcerned ; but there are many ſerpents that dart with ſuch amazing swiftness, that they appear rather to leap than crawl. It is moſt probable, however, that no ſerpent can dart upon even ground farther than its own length at one effort. Our fears indeed may increaſe the force of their ſpeed, which is sometimes found ſo fatal. We are told by ſome, that they will dart to a very great diſtance ; but this we have never been able to aſcertain. The manner of progreſſion in the ſwifteſt ſerpent we know, which is the jaculus, is by inſtantly coiling itſelf upon its tail, and darting from thence to its full extent : then carrying the tail, as quick as lightning, to the head ; coiling and darting again ; and by this means proceeding with extreme rapidity, without ever quitting the ground. Indeed, if we conſider the length and the weakneſs of the back-bone in all theſe animals ; if we regard the make</p><p>of the vertebras, in which we ſhall find the junctures all formed to give play, and none to give power ; we cannot be of opinion that they have a faculty of ſpringing from the ground, as they entirely want a <hi rend="italic">fulcrum,</hi> if we may so expreſs it, from whence to take their ſpring ; the whole body being compoſed of unſupported muſcles and joints that are yielding.</p><p>Though all ſerpents are amphibious, ſome are much fonder of the water than others ; and though deſtitute of fins or gills, remain at the bottom, or ſwim along the surface, with great eaſe. From their internal ſtructure, we ſee how well adapted they are for either element : and how capable their blood is of circulating at the bottom as freely as in the frog or the tortoiſe. They can, however, endure to live in freſh water only; for ſalt is an effectual bane to the whole tribe. The greateſt ſerpents are moſt uſually found in freſh water, either chooſing it as their favourite element, or finding their prey in ſuch places in the gteateſt abundance. But that all will live and ſwim in liquids, appears from an experiment of Redi ; who put a ſerpent into a large glaſs veſſel of wine, where it lived ſwimming about fix hours ; though, when it was by force immerſed and put under that liquid, it lived only one hour and an half. He put another in common water, where it lived three days ; but when it was kept under water, it lived only about 12 hours. Their motion there, however, is perfectly the reverſe of what it is upon land ; for, in order to ſupport themselves upon an element lighter than their bodies, they are obliged to increaſe their ſurface in a very artificial manner. On earth their windings are perpendicular to the ſurface ; in water they are parallel to it : in other words, if a person ſhould wave his hand up and down, it will give an idea of the animal’s progreſs on land ; if to the right and left, it will give ſome idea of its progreſs on the water .</p><p>Some ſerpents have a moſt horrible foetor attending them, which is alone capable of intimidating the brave. This proceeds from two glands near the vent, like thoſe in the weaſel or polecat ; and, like thoſe animals, in proportion as they are excited by rage or by fear the ſcent grows ſtronger. It would ſeem, however, that ſuch ſerpents as are moſt venomous are leaſt offen live in this particular ; ſince the rattleſnake and the viper have no ſmell whatever ; nay, we are told, that at Calecut and Cranganon, in the Eaſt Indies, there are some very noxious ſerpents, who are ſo far from being disagreeable, that their excrements are sought after, and kept as the moſt pleaſing perfume. The Eſculapian ſerpent is also of this number.</p><p>Some ſerpents bring forth their young alive, as the viper ; ſome bring forth eggs, which are hatched by the heat of their ſituation, as the common black ſnake, and the majority of the ſerpent tribe. When a reader, ignorant of anatomy, is told, that ſome of thoſe animals produce their young alive, and that ſome produce eggs only, he is apt to ſuppoſe a very great difference in the internal conformation, which makes ſuch a variety in the manner of bringing forth. But this is not the cafe : theſe animals are internally alike, in whatever manner they produce their young ; and the variety in their bringing forth is rather a flight than a real diſcrimination. The only difference is, that the viper hatches her eggs, and brings them to maturity, within her body ; the ſnake is more premature in her produc-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0311.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0305"/>
tions, and sends her eggs into the light ſome time before the young ones are capable of leaving the ſhell. Thus, if either are opened, the eggs will be found in the womb, covered with their membranous ſhell, and adhering to each other like large beads on a ſtring, In the eggs of both, the young ones will be found, though at different ſtages of maturity : thoſe of the viper will crawl and bite in the moment the ſhell that incloſes them is broke open : thoſe of the ſnake are not yet arrived at their perfect form.</p><p>Father Labat took a ſerpent of the viper kind that was nine feet long, and ordered it to be opened in his preſence. He then ſaw the manner in which the eggs of theſe animals lie in the womb. In this creature there were six eggs, each of the ſize of a gooſe egg, but longer, more pointed, and covered with a membranous ſkin, by which also they were united to each other. Each of theſe eggs contained from 13 to 15 young ones, about six inches long, and as thick as a gooſe- quill. Though the female from whence they were taken was ſpotted, the young ſeemed to have a variety of colours very different from the parent ; and this led the traveller to ſuppoſe that the colour was no characteriſtic mark among ſerpents. Theſe little miſchievous animals were no ſooner let looſe from the ſhell, than they crept about, and put themſelves into a threatening poſture, coiling themſelves up and biting the ſtick with which he was deſtroying them. In this manner he killed 74 young ones ; thoſe that were contained in one of the eggs eſcaped at the place where the female was killed, by the burſting of the egg and their getting among the buſhes.</p><p>The faſcinating power aſcribed to ſerpents, especially to rattleſnakes, by which they are ſaid to draw animals to them, is very curious. It has been deſcribed by ſo many different perſons, who affirmed that they had ſeen inſtances of it, and has been believed by so many men of penetration and diſcernment, that it deserves at leaſt to be mentioned. The rattleſnake fixes its eyes upon any animal, ſuch as a bird or ſquirrel. When the animal ſpies the ſnake, it ſkips from ſpray to ſpray, hovering and approaching nearer the enemy ; deſcending, with diffracted geſtures and cries, from the top of the loftieſt trees to the mouth of the ſnake, who opens his jaws, and in an instant ſwallows the unfortunate animal.</p><p>The following inſtances of faſcination have ſo much the appearance of fiction, that it would require a very uncommon degree of evidence to render them credible. They are extracted from a paper in the Gentleman’s Magazine for the year 1765, p. 5 11. which was communicated by Mr Peter Collinſon from a correſpondent in Philadelphia.</p><p>“ A perſon of good credit was travelling by the side of a creek or small river, where he ſaw a ground ſquirrel running to and fro between the creek and a great tree a few yards diſtant ; the ſquirrel’s hair looking very rough, which ſhowed he was ſeared, and his returns being shorter and ſhorter, the man ſtood to obſerve the cauſe, and ſoon ſpied the head and neck of a rattleſnake pointing at the ſquirrel through a hole of the great tree, it being hollow ; the ſquirrel at length gave over running, and laid himself quietly down with his head cloſe to the ſnake’s ; the ſnake then opened his mouth wide, and took in the ſquirrel’s head ; upon which the man gave</p><p>the ſnake a whip acroſs the neck, and ſo the ſquirrel being reſeaſed, he ran into the creek.</p><p>“ When I was about 13 years old, I lived with William Atkinſon, an honeſt man in Bucks county, who, returning from a ride in warm weather, told us, that while his horſe was drinking at a run, he heard the cry of a blackbird, which he ſpied on the top of a ſapling, fluttering and straining the way he ſeemed unwilling to fly, and holding ſo fall the ſprigs he was perched upon that the ſappling top bent. After he had viewed the bird a few minutes, it quitted the place, and made a circle or two higher in the air, and then reſumed its former ſtanding, fluttering and crying : Thereupon William rode the way the bird drained, and ſoon ſpied a large black ſnake in coil, ſteadily eyeing the bird. He gave the ſnake a laſh with his whip, and this taking off the ſnake’s eye from his prey, the charm was broken, and away fled the bird, changing its note to a ſong of joy.</p><p>“ Mr Nicholas Scull, a ſurveyor, told me, that when he was a young man, as he happened once to be leaning upon a fence, and looking over it, he ſaw a large rattleſnake in coil, looking ſtedfaſtly at him. He found himſelf ſurpriſed and liſtleſs immediately, and had no power for about a minute (as he thinks) but to look at the ſnake, and then he had the reſolution to puſh himſelf from the fence, and turn away, feeling ſuch horror and confuſion as he would not undergo again for any conſideration.</p><p>“ Doctor Chew tells me, a man in Maryland was found fault with by his companion that he did not come along ; the companion ſtepping towards him, observed that his eyes were fixed upon a rattleſnake which was gliding ſlowly towards him, with his head raiſed as if he was reaching up at him ; the man was leaning towards the ſnake, and laying to himſelf, <hi rend="italic">he will bite me! he will bite me !</hi> Upon which his companion caught him by thc ſhoulder, and pulled him about, and cried out, <hi rend="italic">What the devil ails you ? He will bite you ſure enough !</hi> This man found himſelf very ſick after his inchantment.”</p><p>The faſcinating power of ſerpents was believed by Dr Mead and other eminent men, who certainly thought they had ſufficient evidence for admitting it. Incredible therefore as it appears, it ought not to be rejected without examination ; though being of a very extraordinary nature, it cannot be received without unqueſtionable evidence. Scepticiſm is no leſs abſurd than incredulity ; and the true philoſopher will carefully avoid both. Human knowledge is founded on obſervation and experience ; not, however, on every man’s perſonal obſervation and experience, but on the united obſervation and experience of all mankind. But this preſuppoſes the credibility of human teſtimony in every caſe that does not involve an impoſſibility. All the laws of nature are not yet known, nor all the wonderful powers of which ſhe is posseſſed. It is not more incredible <hi rend="italic">à priori,</hi> that the eye of a ſerpent ſhould attract an animal than that a magnet ſhould attract a piece of iron, or a piece of iron attract electrical matter. The evidence of theſe facts reſts entirely on perſonal obſervation or authentic teſtimony. The only thing requiſite with reſpect to objects of teſtimony is, when the fact is ſo extraordinary as has not fallen within the obſervation of the generality of men, the ſtrength<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0312.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0306"/>
of the evidence muſt be in proportion to the extraordinary nature of the fact. To apply this to the preſent case : We have the teſtimony of many perſons that ſome ſerpents have a power of faſcination ; but the generality of men have never obſerved this ; it is therefore an extraordinary fact, and requires extraordinary evidence. But the evidence is not ſatisfactory ; therefore we do not receive it as a fact : on the other hand, it is unphilosophical to reject it <hi rend="italic">à priori.</hi></p><p>No ſubiect has excited more philoſophical controverſy than the poiſon of ſerpents, with regard to its nature and mode of operating. Antiquity has not been sparing in conjecture and fiction upon this ſubject, and its errors have been retained with the moſt reverential obſtinacy by the vulgar : among theſe we are to reckon the fictitious sting fixed in the tail of the ſerpent, as the painters ſometimes have groundleſsly enough represented it ; ſome have invented a ſimilar fiction of a black forked tongue, which the ſerpent vibrates on both sides, and have aſcribed its power of producing ſuch noxious effect to this ; while others, affecting an air of ſuperior diſcernment, have, upon equally good reaſons, aſcribed it to the teeth in general : theſe are all errors of a magnitude that the moſt desultory attention to the ſubject would have been ſufficient to have removed. There is a very ſmall bone cloſely fixed to the upper jaw, in the inſide of the lip of a poiſonous ſerpent, which has a power of moving backward or forward ; to this two or three fangs are annexed larger than the teeth, which the ſerpent, by its aſſiſtance, when enraged, darts forward, or withdraws and conceals at his pleaſure, in a ſimilar manner to the claws of a cat : theſe fangs, which the common people name the large teeth of the ſerpent, are excellently deſcribed by Tyſon in the anatomy of the rattleſnake, which he has given in the Philoſophical Tranſactions. “ In theſe (the fangs) we obſerved a conſiderable cavity near the baſe ; and near the point a very diſcernible fiſſure of ſome length like the slit of a pen : the part of the tooth from the fiſſure to the root was manifestly channelled, which we firſt diſcovered by lightly preſſing the gums ; we then ſaw the poiſon aſcend through the cavity of the fang and flow out of the fiſſure ; and as theſe fangs are ſo very acute, ſo firm and ſolid toward the point (the fiſſure being on the external and convex, not the internal side), nothing could be conceived more convenient either for inflicting a wound, or to inſure the infuſion of the poiſon.” Each of the fangs is ſurrounded with a vesicle furniſhed with glands ſecreting a certain fluid ; which, upon the vehicle being preſſed, ſeems to flow out of the point of the fang. The ſerpent when incenſed, raiſing his head, extends the ſmall bone armed with the fangs mentioned above ; and attacking his enemy with a force combined of the weight of his body and the action of the muſcles, he wounds him with the expanded fangs, and the veſicle being compressed the poiſon immediately flows into the wound : this is clear from the experience of those who, having broken off their fangs with a pair of forceps, handled the ſerpent thus diſarmed without any hurt. The North Americans, after carefully extracting theſe venomous fangs, ſuffer the rattleſnake to bite and gnaw them with his teeth till the blood flows freely, with total impunity.</p><p>Antiquity amuſed itſelf with a fable deſtitute of all appearance of truth, that anger was excited by black bile : they applied this fiction without heſitation to the preſent ſubject, and founded an hypotheſis upon it, to account for the effects of the bite of an incenſed serpent ; pretending to have discovered an ideal canal which conducted the bile from its veſicle to the mouth of the ſerpent, whence it flowed into the part bitten, and produced the moſt fatal ſymptoms. But toward the end of the last century, this ſubject was greatly illuſtrated under the auspices of Ferdinand II. Great Duke of Tuſcany : This prince, desirous of inquiring into that myſterious queſtion, the nature of ſerpents, invited Steno, Rhedi, and ſome other philoſophers of the firſt eminence, to his court ; and a multitude of the moſt poiſonous ſerpents being collected, Rhedi made ſeveral experiments upon them, which diſcovered to him a number of particulars before unknown ; of which the following ſeem to have the beſt claim to our attention. When he either cauſed a living viper to bite a dog, or wounded him with the teeth of one newly dead (the poiſonous veſicle remaining unbroken), the event was the same. If the bite was repeated, its effect became weaker, and at last was lost, the poiſon contained in the veſicle being totally exhausted. That the teeth of ſerpents, when extended to bite, were moistened over with a certain liquor; and whenvthe veſicle at the baſe was pressed, a drop of poiſon flowed to the point of the fang. When the poiſon thus flowing from the veſicle was received in ſoft bread or a sponge, an animal bitten by the ſerpent received no more harm from the wound than from being pricked by a needle, till after a few days, when the venom was reſtored afreſh : but when an animal was wounded with the point of a needle dipped in the poiſon, it was tormented with the ſame pains as if it had been bitten by the viper itſelf. Preſerving ſome of this poiſon in a glaſs, and totally evaporating the moiſture in the ſun, when the reſiduum was diluted again with water, and the point of a needle dipped in the ſolution, Rhedi found to his great ſurpriſe that it had the ſame effect as when recent. But the boldneſs of Tozzi, one who charmed vipers, flung all theſe men who were deeply verſed in natural philoſophy into the utmost astoniſhment. They happening to fall into diſcourſe (while the prince was preſent) upon the certain death which would attend any perſon’s ſwallowing this poiſon of the viper by mistake, inſtead of ſpirit of wine or water ; Tozzi, confiding in his art, drank a conſiderable portion of it without heſitation : they were all aſtonished at his apparent raſhneſs, and predicted instant death to the man ;. however, he eſcaped as ſafely as if he had drunk only ſo much water. This event, which struck the prince and his illuſtrious associates in theſe philoſophical inquiries by its novelty, was well known to the ancients. Lucan, in the 9th book of the Pharſalia, ſpeaking of the ſerpent, says,</p><p><hi rend="italic">Nοxia serpentum est admisto ſanguine pestis</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Morsu virus habent et fatum dente minantur,</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Pocula morte carent.</hi> Phar. 1. 9. v. 614.</p><p>Mix’d with the blood that venom slays alone,</p><p>His bite is poiſon ; death is in his fang ;</p><p>Yet is the draught innoxious.</p><p>Nor muſt we omit obſerving, that barbarous nations are perfectly acquainted with the property of the poiſon of ſerpents by which it retains its deadly power af-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0313.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0307"/>
ter it has been long kept : they have been posseſſed of this fatal ſecret for ages paſt ; it being their cuſtom to tinge the points of their arrows with the juice of ſpurge, putrid fleſh, or oil of tobacco, but more particularly with the poiſon of vipers. Some modern Indians continue the practice to this day ; and we have the teſtimony of Pliny, in his Natural Hiſtory, that the Scythians had long ago the ſame cuſtom : “ The Scythians (ſays that author) dip their arrows in the poiſon of vipers and human blood ; a horrid practice, as the ſlighteſt wound inflicted by one of them defies till the art of medicine.”</p><p>The poiſon of ſerpents produces fatal effects only by mixing with the blood. To confirm this principle, the Florentine philoſophers collected a quantity of poiſon, and gave it to different animals without producing the leaſt inconvenience ; but when applied to an external wound, every one of thoſe horrid ſymptoms which accompany the real bite followed, viz. inflammatory and malignant fevers, ending in death, unleſs nature, by a ſpontaneous hemorrhage, or ſome other evacuation, diſcharged this poiſon. With reſpect to the experiments of Rhedi, evcry one of his obſervations prove, that the liquid preſſed out of the veſicle which moiſtens the fangs of the ſerpents is only noxious by being conveyed into the blood, by means of a puncture or wound ; and the caſe of Tozzi, who drank a conſiderable quantity of this poiſon without ſuffering injury, proves that it hurts the blood only when externally mixed with it.</p><p>The ſymptoms of the bite of the viper have already been deſcribed under <hi rend="smallcaps">Medicine,</hi> n⁰ 408. with the cures recommended by Dr Mead for the bite of ſerpents in general. Under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Poison,</hi> p. 269. we have mentioned the Abbé Fontana’s method of cure, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> ligatures, and the beneficial effects of the volatile alkali. We ſhall now therefore ſupply what has been omitted in theſe articles, by deſcribing the ſymptoms which accompany the bite of other ſerpents.</p><p>The ſymptoms attending the bite of the <hi rend="italic">coluber preſter,</hi> a native of Sweden, are, pain in the wound, tumor, thirſt, aſthma, anxieties, convulſions, and death.</p><p>There is a ſerpent ſtill more dreadful than any of the former, found in Sweden, called <hi rend="italic">coluber careia.</hi> The bite of this is followed by immediate change of colour, coldneſs, ſtupor, palpitation of the heart, acute pain all over the body, and death. Linnaeus tried oil in this caſe, but it proved ineffectual.</p><p>The cr <hi rend="italic">otalus horridus</hi> of Linnaeus, the rattleſnake, kills in a very ſudden manner ; his bite uſually producing death within twelve hours.</p><p>The following account of the poiſon ſerpent of the Eaſt Indies is given by M. d’Obſonville. “ Among the ſerpents of India, that which I believe to be most formidable is but about two feet long, and very ſmall. Its ſkin is freckled with little traits of brown or pale red, and contraſted with a ground of dirty yellow : it is moſtly found in dry and rocky places, and its bite mortal in less than one or two minutes. In the year 1759, and in the province of Cadapet, I ſaw ſeveral inſtances of it ; and among others, one very ſingular, in the midſt of a corps of troops commanded by M. de Buffy. An Indian Gentoo merchant perceived a Mahometan ſoldier of his acquaintance going to kill one of theſe reptiles, which he had found ſleeping under his packet,</p><p>the Gentoo flew to beg its life, proteſting it would do no hurt if it was not firſt provoked ; paſſing at the ſame time his hand under its belly to carry it out of the camp, when suddenly it twiſted round, and bit his little finger ; upon which this unfortunate martyr of a fanatic charity gave a ſhriek, took a few ſteps, and fell down inſensible. They flew to his aſſiſtance, applied the ſerpent-ſtone, fire, and ſcarifications, but they were all ineffectual, his blood was already coagulated. About an hour after, I ſaw the body as they were going to burn it, and I thought I perceived ſome indications of a complete diſſolution of the blood.</p><p>“ The s <hi rend="italic">erρens brulans,</hi> or burning ſerpent, is nearly of the ſame form with the laſt mentioned ; its ſkin is not quite of ſo deep a brown, and is ſpeckled with dark green ſpots ; its poiſon is almoſt as dangerous, but it is leſs active, and its effects are very different : in ſome persons it is a devouring fire, which, as it circulates through the veins, preſently occaſions death ; the blood diſſolves into a lymphatic liquor, reſembling thin broth, without apparently having paſſed through the intermediate ſtate of coagulation, and runs from eyes, noſe, and ears, and even through the pores. In other ſubjects, the poiſon items to have changed the very nature of the humours in diſſolving them ; the ſkin is chapped and becomes ſcaly, the hair falls off, the members are tumefied, the patient feels all over his body the moſt racking pains, numbnefs, and is not long in periſhing. It is said, however, that people have been cured by remedies well and ſoon applied. Be that as it may, it ſeems to me that the poiſon of theſe different reptiles is in general more powerful the more they live in hot and dry places, where they feed upon infects that are full of saline, volatile, and acrimonious particles.”</p><p>We are ignorant of what ſpecie the <hi rend="italic">hemοrrhοis</hi> was, which is deſcribed by Lucan as cauſing by its bite a flux of blood from every part of the body. But the bite of an American ſerpent named de <hi rend="italic">la crux</hi> kills in the ſame manner.</p><p>The di <hi rend="italic">pſaſas</hi> is at preſent likewiſe unknown. Lucan informs us, that the perſon wounded by it was attacked by an unquenchable thirſt. This is finely paint, ed by him ; where A.

This woman, to terminate a diſſipated life with an eaſy death, ordered her phyſicians to prepare a poiſon for her which might best effect this purpoſe. Having tried a number of different experiments upon condemned criminals, they at laſt diſcovered this ſpecies of aſp, which brings on death without any previous appearance of diſtemper or hiccough : the face ſeems in a slight perſpiration, an eaſy inſenſibility and lethargy creeps upon the whole frame, and the perſon bitten ſeems almoſt totally ignorant of his approaching diſſolution. Having acquainted the queen with their diſcovery, ſhe applied the aſp either to her boſom or her arms ; or, according to ſome authors, dipping the point of a needle in the poiſon, and pricking herſelf with it, ſhe expired in an eaſy ſleep.</p><p>The bite of the <hi rend="italic">naja</hi> is ſo fatal, that a man dies by it in the ſpace of an hour, his fleſh entirely falling off his bones in a ſemidiſſolved putrid ſtate : this makes it probable that it is the ſame ſerpent which the ancients named the <hi rend="italic">ſepe.</hi></p><p>The experiments of Rhedi have not, in the opinion of ſome celebrated philoſophers, ſo far cleared the theory of the operation of the poiſon of the viper, as to leave nothing further to be deſired upon that ſubject. Fontana and Carminati have endeavoured to inveſtigate its operations more clearly. Carminati, from 11 experiments, deduces the following concluſions : 1. That if poiſon be inſtilled into a nerve, the animal wounded dies almoſt inſtantly ; and the whole nervous ſyſtem, to which it is rapidly conveyed, is deprived of its quality called <hi rend="italic">ſensibility.</hi> 2. If a muſcle be wounded, it is deprived of its irritability. This is confirmed by the experiments of Fontana. 3. The poiſon injected into a wounded muſcle or tendon is conſiderably longer in killing an animal than that introduced into a nerve. 4. The ſymptoms which precede the death of the animal bitten are, a ſtupor, lethargy, tremors, convulsions, paralyſis of the legs (part wounded), entire diſſolution of the limbs. The blood is not always coagulated, nor its craſis diſſolved. Marks of inflammation are ſometimes diſcovered in certain parts of the animal after death, ſometimes not : theſe are the effects of ſpaſms and convulsions, not of the poiſon. 5. Not the leaſt ſign of the jaundice was diſcoverable in the eyes of any of the animals upon which Carminati made his experiments. 6. The ſtomach in every one of them was very much inflated ; a ſymptom remarked only by Fallopius and Albertini. 7. A ligature applied inſtantly above the part bitten, if it be ſo placed as to admit one, was found by ſome experiments a good preventative againſt the diffuſion of the poiſon : its compreſſion ſhould be considerable, but not exceſſive.</p><p>As few ſerpents, comparatively ſpeaking, are poiſonous, it may be intereſting to our readers to know what are the characteriſtics which diſtinguiſh poiſonous from harmleſs ſerpents. The external characteriſtics of the poiſonous tribe are theſe :</p><p>“ I. A broad head, covered with ſmall ſcales, though it be not a certain criterion of venomous ſerpents, is, with ſome few exceptions, a general character of them.</p><p>“ 2. A tail under one-fifth of the whole length is also a general character of venomous ſerpents ; but, ſince many of thoſe which are not venomous have tails as ſhort, little dependence can be placed upon that circumſtance alone. On the other hand, a tail exceeding that proportion, is a pretty certain mark that the ſpecies to which it belongs is not venomous.</p><p>“ 3. A thin and acute tail is by no means to be conſidered as peculiar to venomous ſerpents ; though a thick and obtuſe one is only to be found among thoſe which are not venomous.</p><p>“ 4. Carinated ſcales are, in ſome meaſure, characteriſtic of venomous ſerpents, ſince in them they are more common than ſmooth ones, in the proportion of nearly four to one ; whereas ſmooth ſcales are, in thole ſerpents which are not venomous, more common, in the proportion of nearly three to one.</p><p>“ Upon the whole, therefore, it appears, that though a pretty certain conjecture may, in many inſtance, he made from the external characters, yet, in order to determine with certainty whether a ſerpent be venomous or not, it becomes neceſſary to have recourſe to ſome certain diagnoſtic. This can only be ſought for in the mouth : we must therefore next conſider how the fangs, with which the mouths of venomous ſerpents are furniſhed, are to be diſtinguiſhed from common teeth.</p><p>“ To thoſe who form their ideas of the fangs of a venomous ſerpent, from thoſe of the rattleſnake, or even from thoſe of the Engliſh viper, it will appear ſtrange that there ſhould be any difficulty in diſtinguiſhing thoſe weapons from common teeth ; and indeed the diſtinction would really be very eaſy, were all venomous ſerpents furniſhed with fangs as large as thoſe of the fore-mentioned ſpecies. But the fact is, that in many ſpecies the fangs are full as ſmall as common teeth, and conſequently cannot, by their ſize, be known from them ; this is the caſe with the <hi rend="italic">coluber laticaudatus, lacteus,</hi> and ſeveral others.”</p><p>Linnæus thought that the fangs might be diſtinguiſhed by their mobility and ſituation ; but other naturaliſts have not found it a general fact that fangs are looſe in their ſockets, nor have they obſerved any difference in ſituation between the fangs of venomous ſerpents and the teeth of others. The following diſtinction is eſtabliſhed by Dr Gray in a paper inſerted in the Philosophical Tranſactions, Vol. lxxix. <hi rend="italic">All venomous ſerpents have only two rows of teeth in the upper jaw, and all others have four.</hi></p><p>In the preface to the <hi rend="italic">Muſeum Regis,</hi> and in the introduction to the claſs amphibia in the <hi rend="italic">Systema Natures,</hi> Linnæus ſays, that the proportion of venomous ſerpents to others is one in ten ; yet, in the <hi rend="italic">Systema Natures,</hi> of which the ſum total in ſpecies is 131, he has marked 23 as venomous, which is ſomewhat more than one in ſix. How he came to be ſo much at variance with himſelf, it is not eaſy to ſay ; but the laſt mentioned proportion ſeems to be not far from the truth, as Dr Gray, after examining 154 ſpecies of ſerpents, found only 26 that ſeemed to be venomous.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0315.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0309"/>
The <hi rend="italic">coluber stolatus</hi> and myct <hi rend="italic">erizαns,</hi> though marked by Linnæus, we are aſſured by Dr Gray are not poiſonous: he thinks the ſame may be ſaid of the <hi rend="italic">leberis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dypsas.</hi> On the other hand, he obſerves, that the <hi rend="italic">boa contortrix, coluber cerastes, laticaudatus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">coluber ſulvus,</hi> none of which are marked in the <hi rend="italic">Systema Nature,</hi> are all poiſonous.</p><p>In addition to the method of cure mentioned in the articles referred to above, we ſhall ſubjoin the preſcription of a new author, Dr Moseley<note anchored="true" n="2" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>[m]* P. 32.</p></note> *, who ſpent 12 years in the West Indies, and whoſe abilities and extensive practice very juſtly intitle his opinion to a place in this work, to the attention of the public, and to all medical gentlemen going to the West Indies.</p><p>“ The bites and ſtings of all venomous animals are cured by the ſame local means ; which are very ſimple, if they were always at hand. The injured part muſt be inſtantly deſtroyed or be cut out. Deſtroying it is the molt ſafe, and equally certain : and the beſt application for that purpoſe is the lapis infernalis or the butter of antimony.—Theſe are preferable to an hot iron, which the ancients uſed, becauſe an hot iron forms a crust, which acts as a defence to the under parts, inſtead of deſtroying them. The lapis infernalis is much better than any other cauſtic, as it melts and penetrates during its application. The bitten part muſt be destroyed to the bottom, and where there is any doubt that the bottom of the wound is not ſufficſently expoſed, butter of antimony ſhould be introduced into it on the following day, as deep as poſſible ; and inciſions ſhould be made to lay every part open to the action of theſe applications. Beſides deſtroying, burning, or cutting out the part, inciſions ſhould be made round the wound, to prevent the communication of the virus. The wound is to be dreſſed for ſome time with poultices, to aſſuage the inflammation cauſed by the cauſtics ; and afterwards with acrid dreſſings and hot digeſtives to drain the injured parts.</p><p>“ Where the above-mentioned cauſtics cannot be procured, corroſive ſublimate, oil of vitriol, aquafortis, ſpirit of ſalt, common cauſtic, or a plaſter made of quicklime and ſoap, may be applied to the wound. Gunpowder laid on the part, and fired, has been uſed with ſucceſs. When a perſon is bitten remote from any aſſiſtance, he ſhould make a tight ligature above the part, until proper application can be made.

Without theſe, ſerpents, of all other animals, would be the moſt expoſed and defenceleſs ; without feet for eſcaping a purſuit, without teeth capable of inflicting a dangerous wound, or without ſtrength for reſiſtance ; incapable, from their ſize, of finding ſecurity in very ſmall retreats like the earthworm, and diſguſting all from their deformity, nothing was left for them but a speedy extirpation. But furniſhed as they are with powerful poiſon, every rank of animals approach them with dread, and never ſeize them but at an advantage. Nor is this all the benefit they derive from it. The malignity of a few ſerves for the protection of all. Though not above a tenth of their number are actually venomous, yet the ſimilitude they all bear to each other excites a general terror of the whole tribe ; and the uncertainty of their enemies about what ſerpents are poiſonous, makes even the moſt , harmleſs formidable. Thus Providence ſeems to have acted with double precaution : it has given ſome of them poiſon for the general defence of a tribe naturally feeble ; but it has thinned the numbers of thoſe which are venomous, left they ſhould become too powerful for the rest of animated nature.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0316.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0310"/>
From theſe noxious qualities in the ſerpent kind, it is no wonder that not only man, but beaſts and birds, carry on an unceasing war againſt them. The ichneumon of the Indians, and the peccary<note anchored="true" n="4" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>[m] See Viverra and Gus.</p></note> * of America, deſtroy them in great numbers. Theſe animals have the art of ſeizing them near the head ; and it is ſaid that they can skin them with great dexterity. The vulture and the eagle alſo prey upon them in great abundance ; and often, ſouſing down from the clouds, drop upon a long ſerpent, which they snatch up ſtruggling and writhing in the air. Dogs alſo are bred up to oppoſe them. Father Feuillce tells us, that being in the woods of Martinico, he was attacked by a large ſerpent, which he could not eaſily avoid, when his dog immediately came to his relief, and ſeized the aſſailant with great courage. The ſerpent entwined him, and presſed him ſo violently, that the blood came out ol his mouth, and yet the dog never ceaſed till he had torn it to pieces. The dog was not ſenſible of his wounds during the ſight ; but ſoon after his head ſwelled prodigiouſly, and he lay on the ground as dead. But his maſter having found a banana tree hard by, he applied its juice mixed with treacle to the wounds, which recovered the dog, and quickly healed his sores.</p><p>The Pſylli of old were famous for charming and deſtroying ſerpents<note anchored="true" n="5" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>[m] See PSYLLI.</p></note> *. Some moderns pretend to the ſame art. Caſaubon ſays that he knew a man who could at any time ſummon 100 ſerpents together, and draw them into the fire. Upon a certain occaſion, when one of them, bigger than the reft, would not be brought in, he only repeated his charm, and it came forward, like the reſt, to ſubmit to the flames. Philoſtratus deſcribes particularly how the Indians charm ſerpents, “ They take a ſcarlet robe, embroidered with golden letters, and ſpread it before a ſerpent’s hole.— The golden letters have a fascinating power ; and by looking ſtedfaſtly, the ſerpent’s eyes are overcome and laid aſleep.” Theſe and many other feats have been often practiſed upon theſe animals by artful men, who had firſt prepared the ſerpents for their exerciſe, and then exhibited them as adventitiouſly aſſembled at their call. In India there is nothing ſo common as dancing ſerpents, which are carried about in a broad flat veſſel, ſomewhat reſembling a sieve. Theſe erect and put themſelves in motion at the word of command. When their keeper ſings a slow tune, they ſeem by their heads to keep time ; when he ſings a quicker meaſure, they appear to move more brisk and lively. All animals have a certain degree of docility ; and we find that ſerpents themſelves can be brought to move and approach at the voice of their maſter. From this trick, ſucceſsfully practiſed before the ignorant, it is moſt probable has ariſen moſt of the boaſted pretenſions which ſome have made to charming of ſerpents ; an art to which the native Americans pretend at this very day, but the exiſtence of which we are aſſured of by Mr Haſſelquiſt amongſt the native Egyptians.</p><p>Though the generality of mankind regard this formidable race with horror, yet there have been ſome nations, and there are ſome at this day, that consider them with veneration and regard. The adoration paid by the ancient Egyptians to a ſerpent is well known : many of the nations at preſent along the weſtern coaſt of Africa retain the ſame unaccountable veneration. Up</p><p>on the gold and slave coaſts, a ſtranger, upon entering the cottages of the natives, is often ſurpriſed to fee the roof ſwarming with ſerpents, that cling there without moleſting and unmoleſted by the natives. But his surpriſe will increate upon going farther ſouthward to the kingdom of Widah, when he finds that a ſerpent is the god of the country. This animal, which travellers deſcribe as a huge overgrown creature, has its habitation, its temple, and its prieſts. Theſe impreſs the vulgar with an opinion of its virtues ; and numbers are daily ſeen to offer not only their goods, their proviſions, and their prayers, at the ſhrine of their hideous deity, but alſo their wives and daughters. These the prieſts readily accept of, and after ſome days of penance return them to their ſuppliants, much benefited by the ſerpent’s ſuppoſed embraces.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Serpent,</hi> a muſical inſtrument, ſerving as a baſs to the cornet, or small shawm <hi rend="italic">,</hi> to ſuſtain a chorus of fingers in a large edifice.

The ſerpent was alſo the ſymbol of medicinc, and of the gods which presided over it, as of Apollo and Æsculapius : and this animal was the object of very ancient and general worſhip, under various appellations and characters. In moſt of the ancient rites we find ſome allusion to the ſerpent, under the ſeveral titles of Ob, Ops, Python, &amp; c. This idolatry is alluded to by Moſes, (Æev. XX. 27.) The woman at Endor who had a familiar ſpirit is called Oub, or Ob, and it is interpreted Pythonisſa. The place where ſhe resided, ſays the learned Mr Bryant, ſeems to have been named from the worſhip then inſtituted ; for Endor is compounded of Enador, and signifies s <hi rend="italic">ons Pythonis, "</hi> the fountain of light, the oracle of the god Ador, which oracle was probably founded by the Canaanites, and had never been totally ſuppressed.

this symbolic worſhip began among the Magi, who were the ſons of Chus ; and by them they were propagated in various parts Wherever the Amonians founded any places of worſhip, and introduced their rites, there was generally some ſtory of a ſerpent. There was a legend about a ſerpent at Colchis, at Thebes, and at Delphi ; and likewiſe in other places. The Greeks called Apollo himſelf Python, which is the ſame as Opis, Oupis, and Oub.</p><p>In Egypt there was a ſerpent named Thermuthis, which was looked upon as very sacred ; and the natives are said to have made uſe of it as a royal tiara, with which they ornamented the ſtatues of Iſis. The kings of Egypt wore high bonnets, terminating in a round ball, and ſurrounded with figures of alps ; and the prieſts likewiſe had the representation of serpents upon their bonnets.</p><p>Abadon, or Abaddon, mentioned in the Revelations XX. 2 is ſuppoſed by Mr Bryant to have been the name of the Ophite god, with whole worſhip the world had been ſo long infected. This worſhip began among the people of Chaldea, who built the city ot Ophis upon the Tigris, and were greatly addicted to divination, and to the worſhip of the ſerpent. From Chaldea the worſhip paſſed into Egypt, where the ſerpent deity was called Canoph, Caneph, and C’neph. It had also the name of Ob or Oub, and was the ſame as the Baſiliſcus or royal ſerpent, the ſame as the Thermuthis, and made uſe of by way of ornament to the ſtatues ol their gods. The chief deity of Egypt is ſaid to have been Vulcan, who was ſtyled Opas. He was the ſame as Oſiris, the Sun, and hence was often called Ob'el, or Pythoſol; and there were pillars ſacred to him, with curious hieroglyphical inſcriptions bearing the same name; whence, among the Greeks, who copied from the Egyptians, every thing gradually tapering to a point was ſtyled Obelos, or obeliſcus.</p><p>As the worſhip of the ſerpent began among the ſons of Chus, Mr Bryant conjectures, that from thence they were denominated Ethiopians and Aithiopians, from Athope or Athopes, the god whom they worſhipped, and not from their complexion : the Ethiopes brought theſe rites into Greece, and called the iſland where they firſt eſtabliſhed them <hi rend="italic">Ellopia, Solis Serpentis insulα,</hi> the ſame with <hi rend="italic">Eubaea,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Oubaia,</hi> i. e. “ the ſerpent iſland.” The ſame learned writer diſcovers traces of the ſerpent worſhip among the Hyperboreans, at Rhodes, named Ophiuſa, in Phrygia, and upon the Helleſpont, in the iſland Cyprus, in Crete, among the Athenians, in the name of Cecrops, among the natives of Thebes in Boeotia, among the Lacedemonians, in Italy, in Syria, &amp; c. and in the names of many places, as well as of the people where the Ophites ſettled. One of the most early hereſies introduced into the Chriſtian church was that of the Ophitæ.
