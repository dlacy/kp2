(A.S. <hi rend="italic">Stær, Stearn,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sterlyng∙,</hi> Lat. <hi rend="italic">Sturnus ;</hi> Fr. <hi rend="italic">Étourneau),</hi> a bird long time well-known in most parts of England, and now, through the extension of its range within the present century, in the rest of Great Britain, as well as in Ireland, where, though not generally distributed, it is very numerous in some districts. It is about the size of a Thrush, and, though at a distance it appears to be black, when near at hand its plumage is seen to be brightly shot with purple, green, and steel-blue, most of the feathers when freshly grown being tipped with buff. These markings wear off in the course of the winter, and in the breeding-season the bird is almost spotless. It is the <hi rend="italic">Sturnus vulgaris</hi> of ornithologists.</p><p>To describe the habits of the Starling<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> They are dwelt ou at some length in Yarrell s <hi rend="italic">British Birds,</hi> ed. <hi rend="bold"> 4,</hi> vol. ii. pp. 229-241. </note> within the limits here allotted is impossible. A more engaging bird scarcely exists, for its familiarity during some months of the year gives opportunities for observing its ways that few others afford, while its varied song, its sprightly gestures, its glossy plumage, and, above all, its character as an insecticide—which last makes it the friend of the agriculturist and the grazier—render it an almost universal favourite. The worst that can be said of it is that it occasionally pilfers fruit, and, as it flocks to roost in autumn and winter among reed-beds, does considerable damage by breaking down the stems.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="2"> A most ridiculous and unfounded charge has been, however, more than once brought against it—that of destroying the eggs of Skylarks. There is little real evidence of its sucking eggs, and much of its not doing so; while, to render the allegation still more absurd, it has been brought by a class of farmers who generally complain that Skylarks themselves are highly injurious. </note> The congregations of Starlings are indeed very marvellous, and no less than the aerial evolutions of the flocks, chiefly before settling for the night, have attracted attention from early times, being mentioned by Pliny (<hi rend="italic">Hist. Naturalis,</hi> x. 24) in the 1st century. The extraordinary precision with which the crowd, often numbering several hundreds, not to say thousands, of birds, wheels, closes, opens out, rises, and descends, as if the whole body were a single living thing— all these movements being executed without a note or cry being uttered—must be seen to be appreciated, and may be seen repeatedly with pleasure. For a resident, the Starling is rather a late breeder. The nest is commonly placed in the hole of a tree or of a building, and its preparation is the work of some little time. The eggs, from 4 to 7 in number, are of a very pale blue, often tinged with green. As the young grow they become very noisy, and their parents, in their assiduous attendance, hardly less so, thus occasionally making themselves disagreeable in a quiet neighbourhood. The Starling has a wide range over Europe and Asia, reaching India ; but examples from Kashmir, Persia, and Armenia have been considered worthy of specific distinction, and the resident Starling of the countries bordering the Mediterranean is generally regarded as a good species, and called <hi rend="italic">S. unicolor</hi> from its unspotted plumage.</p><p>Of the many forms allied to the genus <hi rend="italic">Sturnus,</hi> some of which have perhaps been needlessly separated therefrom, those known as <hi rend="smallcaps">Grackles</hi> (vol. xi. p. 26) have been already mentioned, and there is only room here to notice one other, <hi rend="italic">Pastor,</hi> containing a beautiful species <hi rend="italic">P. roseus,</hi></p><pb xml:id="eb09-22-s06-0458" facs="encyclopediabrit22newyrich_raw_0482.jp2"/><p><label><?xml version="I.O" encoding="utf-8"?> unknown title unknown author <editionStmt> <edition> <date> unknown date <,date> <,edition> <,editionStmt>  unknown <,p>  Converted from a Word document with eb-docx2tei. <,p> <encodingDesc> <appInfo> <application ident="TEI_fromDOCX" version="2.I5.O" xml:id="docxtotei">  Knowledge Project: DOCX to TEI  <,application> <,appInfo> <,encodingDesc> <revisionDesc> <listChange> <change> <date> 2OI9-OI-2OT22:37:I7Z <,date> <name> unknown author <,name> <,change> <,listChange> <,revisionDesc>  the Rose-coloured Starling, which is not an unfrequent visitor to the British Islands. It is a bird of most irregular and erratic habits—a vast horde suddenly arriving at some place to which it may have hitherto been a stranger, and at once making a settlement there, leaving it wholly deserted as soon as the young are reared. This happened in the summer of I875 at Villafranca, in the province of Verona, the castle of which was occupied in a single day by some I2,OOO or I4,OOO birds of this species, as has been graphically told by Sig. de Betta <hi rend="italic">(Atti del R. Ist. Veneto, <,hi> ser. 5, vol. ii.);<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="3"> A partial translation of this paper is given in the <hi rend="italic">Zoologist <,hi> for I878, pp. I8-22. <,note> but similar instances have been before recorded,—as in Bulgaria in I867, near Smyrna in I856, and near Odessa in I844, to mention only some of which particulars have been published.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="3"> It is remarkable that on almost all of these occasions the locality pitched upon has been, either at the time or soon after, ravaged by locusts, which the birds greedily devour. Another fact worthy of attention is that they are often observed to affect trees or shrubs bearing rose-coloured flowers, as <hi rend="italic">Nerium oleander <,hi> and <hi rend="italic">Robinia viscosa, <,hi> among the blossoms of which they themselves may easily escape notice, for their plumage is rose-pink and black shot with blue. <,note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.) <,hi> <,p>
