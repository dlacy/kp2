(1) A framework of wood in which glass is fixed for a window, particularly a framework for large panes of glass in two parts which open and shut by sliding up or down.

The word is, therefore, a doublet of “ case ” and “ cash ” <hi rend="italic">(qq.v).</hi> (2) A long band of silk or other fine or</p><p>ornamented material worn round the waist or over the shoulders as part of a woman’s or child’s dress, or as a sign or badge of office, or as part of an official costume or uniform. The word is an adaptation of the Arab. <hi rend="italic">shāsh,</hi> muslin, especially used (of the soft muslin or silken bands used for wrapping round the head in the form of a turban).
