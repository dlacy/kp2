<p><label>RIDDING, GEORGE</label>
(1828-1904), English headmaster and bishop, was born at Winchester College, of which his father, the Rev. Charles Ridding, vicar of Andover, was a fellow, on the 16th of March 1828. He was educated at Winchester and at Balliol College, Oxford. He became a&lt; fellow of Exeter College and was a tutor from 1853 to 1863. In 1853 he married Mary Louisa Moberly, who died within a year of her marriage. He was appointed second master of Winchester College in 1863, and on the retirement of his father-in-law, Dr Moberly, he succeeded to the headmastership. During the tenure of this office (1867-1884) he carried out successfully a series of radical reforms in the organization of the school, resulting in a great increase both in its reputation and numbers. In 1884 he became the first bishop of Southwell, and brought his powers of organization and conspicuous tact and moderation to bear on the management of the new diocese. He took an active share in its educational and social work, and was materially assisted in these respects by his second wife, Lady Laura Palmer, daughter of the ist earl of Selborne. He resigned his see a short time before his death, which took place on the 30th of August 1904.</p><p>See <hi rend="italic">Church Quarterly Review</hi> July 1905).</p>
