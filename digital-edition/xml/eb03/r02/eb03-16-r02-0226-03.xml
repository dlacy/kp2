<p><label>RHODODENDRON</label>
dwarf rose-bay, in botany : A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the decandria claſs of plants ; and in the natural method ranking under the 18th order, <hi rend="italic">Bicornes.</hi> The calyx is quinquepartite ; the corolla funnel-ſhaped ; the ſtamina declining ; the capſule quinquelocular. There are ſeven ſpecies : the moſt remarkable of which are, I. The hirſutum, with naked hairy leaves, grows naturally on the Alps and ſeveral mountains of Italy. It is a low ſhrub, which ſeldom riſes two feet high, lending out many ligneous branches covered with a light-brown bark, garniſhed cloſely with oval ſpear-ſhaped leaves, fitting pretty cloſe to the branches. They are entire, having a great number of fine iron-coloured hairs on their edges and underſide. The flowers are produced in bunches at the end of the branches in May, having one funnel-ſhaped petal cut into five obtuſe ſeg-ments, and of a pale-red colour. They make a good ſhow, and are ſucceeded by oval capſules, containing ripe ſeeds in Auguſt. 2. The ferrugineum, with ſmooth leaves, hairy on their underſide, is a native of the Alps and Apennines. It riſes with a ſhrubby ſtalk near three feet high, ſending out many irregular branches covered with a purpliſh bark, and cloſely garniſhed with ſmooth ſpear-ſhaped entire leaves, whoſe borders are re-flexed backward ; the upper ſide is of a light lucid green, their under ſide of an iron colour. The flowers are produced at the ends of the branches, are funnel-ſhaped, cut into five ſegments, and of a pale roſe colour. Theſe plants are propagated by ſeeds ; but, being natives of barren rocky foils and cold ſituations, they do not thrive in gardens, and for want of their uſual covering of ſnow in the winter are often killed by froſt in this country. 3. The chamaeciſtus, or ciliated-leaved dwarf roſe-bay, is a low deciduous ſhrub, native of Mount Baldus, and near Saltzburg, in Germany. It</p>

<p>grows to the height of about a yard ; the branches are numerous, produced irregularly, and covered with a purpliſh bark. The leaves are oval, ſpear-ſhaped, ſmall, and in the under ſurface of the colour of iron. The flowers are produced at the end of the branches in bunches, are of a wheel-ſhaped figure, pretty large, of a fine crimſon colour, and handſome appearance. They appear in June, and are ſucceeded by oval capſules containing ripe feeds in September. 4. The Dauricum, or Daurian dwarf roſe-bay, is a low deciduous ſhrub, and native of Dauria. Its branches are numerous, and covered with a browniſh bark. The flowers are wheel-ſhaped, large, and of a beautiful roſe-colour : they appear in May, and are ſucceeded by oval capſules full of feeds, which in England do not always ripen. 5. The maximum, or American mountain laurel, is an evergreen ſhrub, and native of Virginia, where it grows naturally on the higheſt mountains, and on the edges of cliffs, precipices, &amp;c. where it reaches the ſize of a moderate tree, though with us it ſeldom riſes higher than fix feet. The fl0wer3 continue by ſucceſſion ſometimes more than two months, and are ſucceeded by oval capſules full of feeds. 6. The Ponticum, or Pontic dwarf roſe-bay, is an evergreen ſhrub, native of the eaſt, and of moſt ſhady places near Gibraltar. It grows to the height of four or five feet. The leaves are ſpear-ſhaped, gloſſy on both ſides, acute, and placed on ſhort foot-ſtalks on the branches : the flowers, which are produced in cluſters, are bell-ſhaped, and of a fine purple colour. They appear in July, and are ſucceeded by oval capſules containing ſeeds, which in England ſeldom attain to maturity.</p><p>In Siberia, a ſpecies of this plant is uſed with great ſucceſs in gouty and rheumatic affections ; of which the following account is given in the 5th volume of the Medical Commentaries, p. 434. in a letter from Dr Guthrie of Peterſhurgh to Dr Duncan of Edinburgh. “ It is the rhododendrum chryſanthemum, nova ſpecies, belonging to the claſs of decandria, diſcovered by Profeſ-ſor Pallas in his tour through Siberia. This Alpine ſhrub grows near the tops of the high mountains named <hi rend="italic">Sajanes,</hi> in the neighbourhood of the river Jeniſe in Siberia ; and delights in the ſkirts of the ſnow-covered ſummits, above the region that produces trees. When the inhabitants of that country mean to exhibit it in arthritic or rheumatic diſorders, they take about two drams of the dried ſhrub, ſtalk and leaves, with nine or ten ounces of boiling water, and putting them into an earthen pot, they lute on the head, and place them in an oven during the night. This infuſion (for it is not allowed to boil) the lick man drinks next morning for a doſe. It occaſions heat, together with a degree of intoxication, reſembling the effects of ſpirituous liquors, and a ſingular kind of uneaſy ſenſation in the parts affected, accompanied with a ſort of vermiculatio, which is likewiſe confined to the diſeaſed parts. The patient is not permitted to quench the thirl! which this medicine occaſions ; as fluids, particularly cold water, produce vomiting, which leſſens the power of the ſpe-cific. In a few hours, however, all the diſagreeable effects of the doſe diſappear, commonly with two or three ſtools. The patient then finds himſelf greatly relieved of his diſorder ; and has ſeldom occaſion to repeat the medicine above two or three times to complete a cure. The inhabitants of Siberia call this ſhrub <hi rend="italic">chei</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tea,</hi> from their drinking, in common, a weak infuſion of it, as we do the Chineſe plant of that name. This practice ſhows that the plant, uſed in ſmall quantities, muſt be innocent. Profeſſor Pallas informs me, that he ſent ſome time ago ſome of this ſhrub dried to Profeſſor Koelpin at Stetin ; and he ſhowed me a letter from that gentleman, where he ſays, that he has given It with ſucceſs in ſeveral caſes, particularly in what he calls the <hi rend="italic">arthritica venerea,</hi> with a tophus arthriticus on the carpus, and it produced a complete cure. It muſt be remarked, that the doſe which theſe hardy Siberians take, who are alſo in the habit of drinking it. as tea, would, in all probability, be too ſtrong for our countrymen ; however, it is a medicine which we may certainly give with ſafety, beginning with ſmall doſes.”</p>
