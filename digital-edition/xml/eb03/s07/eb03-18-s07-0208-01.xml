(John), a celebrated and learned natural philpſopher, was the ſon of John James Swammerdam, an apothecary and famous naturaliſt of Amſterdam, and was born in 1637. His father intended him for the church, and with this view had him inſtructed in Latin and Greek ; but he, thinking himſelf unequal to ſo important a taſk, prevailed with his father to conſent to his applying himſelf to phyſic. As he was kept at home till he ſhould be properly qualified to engage in that ſtudy, he was frequently employed in cleaning his father’s curioſities, and putting every thing in its proper place. This inſpired our author with an early taſte for natural hiſtory ; ſo that, not content with the ſurvey of the curioſities his father had pur- chaſed, he ſoon began to make a collection of his own, which he compared with the accounts given of them by the beſt writers. When grown up, he ſeriouſly attended to his anatomical and medical ſtudies ; yet ſpent part of the day and the night in diſcovering, catching, and examining the flying infects proper to thole times, not only in the province <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> of Holland, but in thoſe of Guelderland and Utrecht.—- Thus initiated in natural hiſtory, he went to the univerſity of Leyden in 165Ί ; and in 1663 was admittcd a candidate of phyſic in that univerſity. His attention being now engaged by anatomy, he began to conſider how the parts of the body, prepared by diſſection, could be preſerved, and kept in confiant order for anatomical demonſtration ; and herein he lucceeded, as he had done before in his nice contrivances for diſſecting and managing the minuteſt infects. Our author afterwards made a journey into France, where he ſpent ſome time at Saumur, and wſhere he became acquainted with ſeveral learned men. In 1667 he returned to Leyden, and took his degree of Doctor of Phyſic. The next year the grand duke of Tuſeany being in Holland in order to fee the curioſities of the country, came to view thoſe of our author and his father ; and on this occalion Swammerdam made ſome anatomical diſſections of infects in the pre- ſence of that prince, who was ſtruck with admiration at our author’s great ſkill in managing them, eſpecially at his proving that the future butterfly lay with all its parts neatly folded up in a caterpillar, tty actually removing the integuments that covered the former, and extricating and exhibiting all its parts, however minute, with incredible ingenuity, by means of inſtruments of inconceivable ſineneſs. On this occafion the duke offered our author 12,000 florins for his ſhare of the collection, on condition of his removing them himſelf into Tuſcany, and coming to live at the court of Florence ; but Swammerdam, who hated a court life, declined his highnefs’s propoſal. Tn 1663, he publiſh- ed a General Hiſtory of Infects. About this time, his father began to take offence at his inconſiderately neglecting the practice of phyſic, which might have ſupported him in affluence ; and would neither ſupply him with money nor clothes. This reduced him to ſome. difficulties. In 1675 he publiſhed his Hiſtory of the Ephemeras ; and his father dying the ſame year, left him a fortune ſufficient for his ſup-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0215.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0209"/>
post : but he did not long ſurvive him, for he died in 1682. Gaubius gave a tranſlation of all his works from the original Dutch into Latin, from which they were tranſlated into Engliſh, in folio, in 1758. The celebrated Boerhaave wrote his life.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
