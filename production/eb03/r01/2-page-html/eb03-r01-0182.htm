<p><span class="font2">to four or five millions Sterling annually ; at the ſame time they were exempt from taxation. The crown had&nbsp;of late years attempted to break through this privilege.&nbsp;To avoid the danger, the clergy prefented to the court&nbsp;a free gift </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font2">a ſum of money ſomewhat ſhort ol a mil-lion Sterling every five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The nobility was nominally the ſecond order of the ſtatc, but it was in reality the firſt. The nobles amounted to no lefs than 200,oco in number. The title and&nbsp;rank defcended to all the children of the family, but&nbsp;the property to the eldeſt alone : hence vaſt multitudes&nbsp;of them were depcndent upon the bounty of the court.&nbsp;They regarded the ufeful and commercial arts as diſho-nourable, and even the liberal profeſſions of the law and&nbsp;phyfic as in a great meaſure beneath their dignity, diſ-daining to intermarry with the families of their profef-ſors. °The feudal ſyſtem in its purity was extremely&nbsp;favourable to the production of refpectable qualities in&nbsp;the minds of thoſe who belonged to the order of the&nbsp;nobles ; but the introduction of commerce has rendered&nbsp;its decline equally unfavourable to that claſs of men.&nbsp;Inſtead of the ancient patriarchal attachment between&nbsp;the feudal chieftain and his vaffals, the nobility had be-come greedy landlords in the provinces, that they mιg∩t&nbsp;appear in ſplendor at court and in the capital. There,&nbsp;loſt in intrigue, ſenſuality, and vanity, their characters&nbsp;became frivolous and contemptible. Such of the French&nbsp;nobleſſe, however, as remained in the provinces, regard-ed with indignation this degradation oſ their order, and&nbsp;ſtill retained a proud ſenſe of honour and of courage,&nbsp;•which has always rendered them reſpectable. The order&nbsp;of the nobles was exempted from the pay ment of taxes,&nbsp;although the property of fome of them was immenſe.&nbsp;The eſtates of the prince of Conde, for example, were&nbsp;worth L. 200,000 a year, and thoſe of the duke of orleans nearly twice as much. The crown had indeed&nbsp;impoſed ſome trifling taxes upon the nobleſſe, which,&nbsp;however, they in a great meaſure contrived to elude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Next to the nobles, and as a privileged order poſſeſ-fing a ſecondary kind of nobility of their own, we may mention the parliaments. Theſe were large bodies of&nbsp;men, in different provinces, appointed as courts of law&nbsp;for the adminiſtration of juſtice. In conſequence of the&nbsp;corruption of the officers of ſtate, the members purcha-ſed their places, which they held for life ; but the ſhn&nbsp;was ufually preferred when he offered to purchaſe his&nbsp;father’s place. In conſequence of this laſt circumſtance,&nbsp;the practifing lawyers had little chance of ever beco-ming judges. Courts thus conſtituted conſiſted of a&nbsp;motley mixture of old and young, learned and ignorant,&nbsp;men. Juſtice was ill adminiſtered. 'Γhe judges allowed their votes in depending cauſes to be openly ſolici-ted by the parties or their friends. No wife man ever&nbsp;entered into a litigation againſt a member of one of&nbsp;theſe parliaments </span><span class="font1">5 </span><span class="font2">no lawyer would undertake to plead&nbsp;■his cauſe.; it never came to a ſucceſsful iffue, and uſu-ally never came to any iſſue at all. After the ſtates-general had fallen into difiιfe, the parliaments acquired&nbsp;a certain degree of political confequence, and formed&nbsp;the only check upon the abſolute power of the crown.&nbsp;The laws, or royal edicts, before being put in force,&nbsp;were always ſent to be regiſtered in the books oi the&nbsp;parliaments. Taking advantage </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font2">this, in favourable&nbsp;times and circumſtances, they often delayed or refuſed&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">io regiſter .the royal edicts, and preſented remonſtrances</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2">againſt them. This was done under a kind of legal fiction : for they pretended that the obnoxious edict&nbsp;being injurious to the public happinefs, could not be&nbsp;the will of the king, but muſt either be a forgery or an&nbsp;impoſition by the miniſters. Theſe objections were got&nbsp;the better of, either by a pofitive order from the king,&nbsp;or by his coming in perfon and ordering the edict to&nbsp;be regiſtered. The parliaments, however, often carried their oppoſition very far, even to the ruin of them-felves and their families as individuals. This rendered&nbsp;them extremely popular with the nation, and enabled&nbsp;them to embarrafs a weak adminiſtration. After all,&nbsp;however, the oppoſiticn of the parliaments was fo feeble, that it was never thought worth while to aboliſh&nbsp;them entirely till towards the end of the reign of&nbsp;Louis XV. but they were reſtored as a popular meafure&nbsp;at the beginning of thc reign of Louis XVI.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tiers etat,</span><span class="font2"> or commons, formed the loweſt order of the ſtate in France, and they were depreſſed and mi-ferable in the extreme. To form a conception of their&nbsp;ſituation, it is neceſſary to obſerve that they bore the&nbsp;whole pecuniary burdens of the ſtate : They alone&nbsp;were liable to taxation. An expenſive and ambitious&nbsp;court ; an army of 200,000 men in time of peace, and&nbsp;of twice that number in war ; a conſiderable marine eſtabliſhment, public roads and works, were all ſupported&nbsp;excluſively by the loweſt of the people. To add to the&nbsp;evil, the revenues were ill collected. They were let out&nbsp;to farmers-general at a certain ſum, over and above&nbsp;which they not only acquired immenſe fortunes to them-ſelves, but were enabled to advance enormous preſents&nbsp;to thoſe favourites or miſtreſſes of the king or the mi-niſter, by means of whom they procured their places.&nbsp;To raiſe all this money from the people, they were&nbsp;guilty of the cruelleſt oppreſſion, having it in their&nbsp;power to obtain whatever revenue laws they pleaſed,&nbsp;and executing them in the fevereſt manner. For this laſt&nbsp;purpoſe they kept in pay an army of clerks, ſubalterns,&nbsp;ſcouts, and ſpies, amounting to 80,000 men. Theſe&nbsp;men were indeed deteſted by the king, whom they de*&nbsp;ceived and kept in poverty ; by the people, whom they&nbsp;oppreſſed ; and by the ancient nobility, as purſe-proud&nbsp;upſtarts. But the court of France could never contrive</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">to manage without them. The peaſants could be call-ed out by the intendants of the provinces in what they called </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">corvées</span><span class="font2"> to work upon the high roads for a certain&nbsp;number of days in the year, which was a ſource of ſe-vere oppreffion, as the intendant had the choice of the&nbsp;time and place of their employment, and was not bound&nbsp;to accept of any commutation in money. They were&nbsp;moreover ſubject to the nobles in a thouſand ways.&nbsp;The nobles retained all their ancient manerial or patri-monial juriſdictions. The common people being an-ciently ſlaves, had obtained their freedom upon different&nbsp;conditions. In many places they and their poſterity&nbsp;remained bound to pay a perpetual tribute to their feudal lords. Such tributes formed a conſiderable part of&nbsp;the revenue of many of the provincial nobles. No man&nbsp;could be an officer of the army, by a late regulation,&nbsp;who did not produce proofs of nobility for four genera-tions. The parliaments, although originally of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tiers&nbsp;etat,</span><span class="font2"> attempted alſo to introduce a rule that none but&nbsp;the nobleſſe ſhould be admitted into their order. In&nbsp;ſuch a ſituation, it will not be accounted ſurpriſing that&nbsp;the common people of Fiance were extremely ſuperſti-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
