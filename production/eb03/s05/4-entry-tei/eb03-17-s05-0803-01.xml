a county of Scotland, of which Stirling is the capital. It extends 20 miles in length and 12 in breadth ; being bounded on the west by part of Lennox and Clydeſdale ; on the eaſt, by Clackmannanſhire, the river Forth, and part of Lothian ; on the ſouth-eaſt, by Lothian ; and on the north, by Monteith. The face of the country is open and agreeable, diverſified by hill and dale, well watered with ſtreams and rivers ; the principal of which is the Forth, riſing in the neighbourhood of a high mountain called <hi rend="italic">Ben-Lomond,</hi> and, running eaſtward, forms the frith of Edinburgh. The southern part is hilly, affording plenty of game, and paſturage for ſheep, horſes, and black cattle. The eaſtern part is fertile, producing plentiful harvests of corn, and great abundance of coal. Lead-ore is found in different parts of the ſhire ; and the rivers abound with pike, trout, and falmon.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
