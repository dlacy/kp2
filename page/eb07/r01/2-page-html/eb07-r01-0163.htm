<p><span class="font1">REPTON, an ancient market-town of the county of Derby, situated in the hundred of Repton cum Gresley,&nbsp;four miles from Burton-on-Trent, and 124 from London.&nbsp;It is a place of great antiquity, having been the residence&nbsp;of the Saxon kings of Mercia during the heptarchy, several of whom are buried in the church, which is still a&nbsp;handsome Gothic building, w ith a lofty spire. It had once&nbsp;a market, but it is now’ fallen into neglect. The population&nbsp;amounted in 1801 to 1424, in 1811 to 1648, in 1821 to&nbsp;1802, and in 1831 to 1758.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REQUENA, a city of Spain, in the province of Cuença, and the capital of a district of the same name. It stands on&nbsp;a height in a valley watered by the river Magro, which is&nbsp;fertile as regards meadows, and produces great quantities of&nbsp;rich fruits. The city contains three churches, seven monasteries, and 6500 inhabitants, who make silk goods from&nbsp;the worms fed on the mulberries growing in the vicinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RESENTMENT means a strong perception of good or ill, generally a deep sense of injury, and may be distinguished into </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">anger</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">revenge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RESHD, or Resht, a town of Persia, and the capital of the province of Ghilan. It is a large town, with a considerable trade, and well-furnished shops and warehouses.&nbsp;It is so enveloped in trees, that no idea can be formed of it&nbsp;taken in any one point of view. Exclusive of the bazaars,&nbsp;which occupy a considerable space in the centre of the&nbsp;tow<sup>,</sup>n, it is composed of small compartments, divided for&nbsp;the most part by narrow and obscure alleys. There are&nbsp;not many principal streets ; and only some of them are&nbsp;paved, whilst others have merely a little gravel thrown in&nbsp;the centre for the water to run on, and some are left unfashioned in any way, except in having a raised pathway&nbsp;at the sides for foot-passengers, which is of great convenience in wet weather. The bazaars or shops, of which&nbsp;there are said to be 1200, are extensive, regular, clean, and&nbsp;well kept. They are well paved, but not entirely covered&nbsp;in from the weather. Instead of arched or domed roofs,&nbsp;extending from one side of the street to the other, the roofs&nbsp;only project nearly to the centre of the street, covering the&nbsp;shops and foot-passengers. There is in this town a bustle&nbsp;and hum of business, more than is seen in most of Persian&nbsp;towns. Natives of various countries are seen passing and&nbsp;repassing on the pavement below ; and persons of every occupation, busily follow ing their several callings, animate the&nbsp;scene, and enliven it with their gay costumes. This town&nbsp;swarms with beggars of all descriptions, beyond what can easily be conceived. They are covered with leprosy, and cutaneous disorders the roost revolting. The opium-eaters are&nbsp;among the most miserable of these objects. The religious&nbsp;mendicants, or fakeers and dervishes, are also very numerous, and the most impudent of all. There were formerly&nbsp;Russians, Armenians, and Jews in this city ; but they were&nbsp;forced away by the bigotry and intolerance of the inhabitants, who reviled every foreigner that professed a different&nbsp;creed from their own. Reshd is one of the most considerable entrepôts on the Caspian for exchanging the commodities of Persia with those of Astracan, and is the chief mart&nbsp;for silk, the staple produce of the province. The rate of interest for money is from tour to twelve per cent, per month ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">but this last rate is seldom paid. Fraser, who visited this place in 1822, was at pains to ascertain the amount of the&nbsp;population ; and from every inquiry he could make, he estimated the male inhabitants at between thirty and forty&nbsp;thousand ; and, considering other circumstances, the appearance of the markets and other public places, he estimates the whole population at eighty thousand. Reshd is an&nbsp;inland town, and all its maritime trade is carried on through&nbsp;the port of Ezellee. Long. 49. 50. E. Lat. 37. 20. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RESIDUAL Analysis, a calculus invented by Mr Landen, and proposed as a substitute for the method of fluxions. The design of it was to avoid introducing the idea of motion, and of quantities infinitely small, into mathematical&nbsp;investigation. The residual analysis accordingly proceeds&nbsp;by taking the difference of the same function of a variable&nbsp;quantity in two different states of the said variable quantity, and denoting the relation of this difference to the difference between the two states of the said variable quantity. This relation being first generally expressed, is next&nbsp;considered in the case when the difference of the two states&nbsp;of the variable quantity is = 0 ; and by that means it is&nbsp;obvious that the same thing is done as when the function&nbsp;cf a variable quantity is assigned by the ordinary methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The evolutions of the functions, considered in this very general view, require the aid of a new theorem, discovered&nbsp;by Mr Landen, and remarkable for its simplicity and great&nbsp;extent. It is, that if </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">x</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">v</span><span class="font1"> are any two variable quantities</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">where </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font1"> are any integer numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This theorem is the basis of tile calculus, and from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>m</sup> m</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">expressions </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">x<sup>n</sup> — v&quot;,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">x — v</span><span class="font1"> having the form of what algebraists denominate </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">residuals,</span><span class="font1"> the inventor gave to his&nbsp;method the name of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">residual analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mr Landen published the first account of this method in 1758, which he denominated a Discourse concerning the&nbsp;Residual Analysis. The first book of the analysis appeared&nbsp;in 1764, and contained an explanation of the principles </span><span class="font2">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the new calculus, with its application to problems of the direct method of fluxions ; the second book, which solved several problems of the inverse method, was never published.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Residual </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Root</span><span class="font1"> is a root composed of two members only connected by the sign — or minus. Thus, β—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b,</span><span class="font1"> or 5 — 3,&nbsp;is a residual root ; and is so called, because its true value is&nbsp;no more than the residue or difference between the parts&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font1"> or 5 and 3, which in this case is 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RESINA, a town of Italy, in the kingdom of Naples, on the sea-shore. It is situated near to Portici, and is built&nbsp;on the ruins of Herculaneum, at the foot of Mount Vesuvius, and in the way by which it is commonly ascended.&nbsp;It contains about 7700 inhabitants, who are mostly cultivators of vines, and produce the wine lachryma Christi.</span></p>
