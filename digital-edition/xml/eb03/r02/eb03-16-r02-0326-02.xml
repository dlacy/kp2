                <p><label>ROME</label>, a very ancient and celebrated city of Italy, ſituated on the
                    river Tiber, in E. Long. 13°. N. Lat. 41. 45, once the capital of the greateſt
                    empire in the world ; and famous in modern hiſtory ſor being the centre of an
                    eccleſiaſtical tyranny, by which for many ages the greateſt part of the world
                    was held in ſubjection.</p>
                <p>The ancient Romans derived their origin from Æneas the Trojan hero : and though
                    ſome hiſtorians pretend to treat his voyage into Italy as a mere fable, yet no
                    ſufficient reaſons for rejecting this account have been offered, nor has any
                    more probable hiſtory of the origin of the Roman name been given ; ſo that,
                    without entering into the diſpute, we ſhall proceed to the hiſtory of Æneas and
                    his ſucceſſors as they are recorded by the generality of Latin writers.</p>
                <p>When the Greeks, by the treachery of the ſons of Antehor, or by whatever other
                    means it happened, were become maſters of Troy, Æneas with the forces under his
                    command retired into the fortreſs of the city, and defended it bravely for ſome
                    time; but yielding at length to neceſſity, he conveyed away his gods, his
                    father, wife, and children, with every thing he had that was valuable, and,
                    followed by a numerous crowd of Trojans, fled to the ſtrong places of Mount Ida.
                    Hither all thoſe of his countrymen, who were more anxious than the reſt to
                    preſerve their liberty, flocked to him from the ſeveral towns of Troas. His army
                    thus augmented and advantageouſly polled, he continued quiet, waiting for the
                    departure of the Greeks, who, it was imagined, would return home as ſoon as they
                    had pillaged the country. But theſe, after they had enriched themſelves with the
                    ſpoils of Troy and of the neighbouring towns, turned their arms againſt the
                    fugitives, re ſolving to attack them in their ſtrong-holds upon the mountain.
                    Æneas, to avoid the hazard of being forced in his laſt refuge, had recourſe to
                    négociation ; and, by his heralds, intreated the enemy not to conſtrain him to a
                    battle. Peace was granted him, on condition that he with his followers quitted
                    the Trojan territories ; and. the Greeks, on their part, promiſed not to moleſt
                    him in his retreat, but to let him ſafely paſs through any country within the
                    extent of their domination.</p>
                <p>Upon this aſſurance Æneas equipped a fleet, in order to ſeek a ſettlement in
                    ſome foreign land. We are told, that at his departure he leſt his eldeſt ſon
                    Aſcanius with the Daſylites, a people of Bithynia, who deſired to have him for
                    their king ; but that the young prince did not remain long with them : for when
                    Sca-andrius (Aſtyanax), with the reſt of the Hectoridse whom Neoptolemus
                    permitted to return home from Greece, repaired to him, he put himſelf at their
                    head, and led them back to their native country.</p>
                <p>The Trojan having croſſed the Helleſpont, arrived in the peninſula of Pallene,
                    where he built a city, called from him <hi rend="italic">Ænda,</hi> and left
                    in it a part of that multitude which had followed him. From thence he failed to
                    Delos ; and thence to Cythera, where he erected a temple to Venus. He built
                    another to the ſame goddeſs in Zacynthus, in which iſland he likewiſe inſtituted
                    games, called the <hi rend="italic">races of Æneas and Penns :</hi> the
                    ſtatues of both, ſays Dionyſius, are ſtanding to this day. In Leucas, where the
                    Trojans landed, was to be ſeen, in the ſame author’s time, a temple erected to
                    Venus the mother of Ænea6. Nor were Actium and Am-brada without monuments that
                    teſtified his arrival in thoſe places. At Dodona were found brazen vaſes, upon
                    which the name of the Trojan hero, who had made an offering of them to Jupiter,
                    was engraven in old characters. Not far from Buthrotos, in Epirus, a Trojan camp
                    which had eſeaped the injuries of time, retained the name of <hi rend="italic">Troja.</hi> All theſe antiquities, ſtill ſubſiſting in the reign <hi
                        rend="italic"> of</hi> Auguſtus, were then looked upon as indiſputable
                    proofs of Æneas’s voyage to Epirus: “ and that he carne into Italy (adds the
                    ſame Dionyſius) we have the concurrent teſtimony of all the Romans ; the
                    ceremonies they obſerve in their ſacrriſices and feſtivals bear witneſs to it,
                    as all the Sibylline books, the Pythian oracles, and many other things which
                    nobody can reaſonably reject as invented merely for ornament.”</p>
                <p>The firſt land of Italy which Æneas made, after croſſing the Ionian ſea, was
                    cape Minerva, in Iapygia; and here he went on ſhore. Sailing afterwards from
                    hence, and coaſting along the ſouth-eaſt of Italy and the eaſt and ſouth ſides
                    of Sicily, he arrived with his fleet either by choice or by ſtreſs <hi
                        rend="italic"> of</hi> weather at the port of Drepanuτn in that iſland.
                    Elymus and Ægeftus, who had eſeaped from Troy a little before him, had brought a
                    Trojan colony to this place. Æneas augmented it by a good number of his
                    followers, whom, pleaſed to have found a ſafe reſting place after many dangers
                    and fatiguing voyages, he willingly left behind him at tlreir requeſt ; though
                    certain authors pretend that he was conſtrained to it by the difficulty of
                    tranſporting them, becauſe ſome Trojan women, weary of the ſea, had burnt a
                    conſiderable part of his ſhips.</p>
                <p>Æneas, leaving Dreρanum, fleered hie courſe for I-</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0327" facs="gri_33125011196389_0333.tif"/>
                <p>taly -acroſs the Tyrrhenian ſea. To the cape where he firſt landed, he gave the
                    name <hi rend="italic">Paiinurus,</hi> ſrom one of his pilots who died there.
                    The little iſland of Leuca∙ fia, not far diſtant, whither he ſailed next, got
                    its name in like manner from a daughter of Æneas’s filler, who there ended her
                    days. The port of Miſenum, the iſland of Prochyta, and the promontory of Cajeta,
                    where he ſucceſſively arrived’, were ſo called from being the burial places, the
                    firſt of a noble l’rojan his companion, the ſecond of his kinſwoman, and the
                    third of his ηurfe. At length the Trojan prince and his choſen band finiſhed
                    their tedious and painful voyages on the coaſt of the ſince famous Latium. This
                    was a ſmall territory on the eaſt ſide of the river Tiber, containing a part of
                    the preſent <hi rend="italic">Cavpagna di Roma :</hi> Latinus was the king of
                    it ; 'his capital town, Laurentum ; his fubjects, a people who, till his time
                    called <hi rend="italic">Aborigines,</hi> had from him taken the name of <hi
                        rend="italic"> Latins.</hi> Here, far removed from their implacable enemies
                    the Greeks, Æneas and his followers undertook to raiſe a ſecond Troy: they
                    fortified a camp near the mouth of the Ty-ber, gave it the name of <hi
                        rend="italic"> Troy,</hi> and flattered themſelves with the hopes of a
                    quiet ſettlement, and a period to .all their unhappy adventures.</p>
                <p>When Æneas arrived in Italy, Latinus was engaged in a war with the Rutuli, a
                    neighbouring people, in which he was attended but with very indifferent ſucceſs,
                    •when news was brought him that a foreign army had made a deſcent on his coaſts,
                    pillaged the maritime part of his dominions, and were fortifying themſelves in a
                    eamp at a ſmall diſtance from the ſea. Hereupon he marched againſt them with all
                    his forces, hoping to oblige them to reimbark and abandon his dominions, without
                    meeting with any great reſiſtance from a band of vagabonds, as he ſuppoſed, or
                    pirates, come only to ſeek ſor plunder: but finding them, as he drew near,
                    well-armed, and regularly drawn up, he thought it advifable to forbear engaging
                    troops that appeared ſo well diſciplined ; and, inſtead of venturing a battle,
                    to deſire a parley. In this conference Latinus underſtanding who they were, and
                    being at the ſame time ſtruck with terror, and touched with com-paſſion for
                    thoſe brave but unfortunate men, entered into a treaty with them, and aſſigned
                    them a tract of land for a ſettlement, on condition that they ſhould employ
                    their arms and exert their valour in defence of his dominions, and look upon the
                    Rutuli as a common enemy. This condition Æneas readily accepted; and’ complied
                    with his engagement ſo faithfully, that Latinus came at length to repoſe an
                    entire confidence in the Trojan ; and in proof of it gave him Lavinia, his
                    daughter and only child, in marriage, ſecuring to him by that means the
                    ſucceſſion to the throne of Latinm. Æneas, to teftify his gratitude to Latinus,
                    and affection. for Lavinia, gave her name to the camp he had' pitched ; and
                    inſtead of Troy called it <hi rend="italic">Lavi-fiium.</hi> The Trojans
                    followed the example of their leader ; and by making alliances with La∙tin
                    families, became, in a ſhort time, one and the ſame people with the Latins.</p>
                <p>in the mean time Turnus, the queen’s nephew, who had been brought up in the
                    palace under the eye of Latinus, and entertained hopes of marrying Lavinia and
                    ſucceeding to the throne, ſeeing the princeſs bellowed on a ſtranger, and all
                    his views defeated, went</p>
                <p>over to the Rutuli ; and by ſtirring them up, 'brought on a battle between them
                    and the Latins, in which both he and Latinus were killed. Thus Æneas, by the
                    death of his father-in-law, and by that of a troubleſome rival, came into the
                    quiet poſſeſſion of the kingdom of Latium, which he governed with great wiſdom,
                    and tranſmitted to his poſterity.</p>
                <p>Æneas is ſaid to have reigned three years ; during which time he eſtabliſhed the
                    worſhip of the gods of his own country, and to the religion of the Latins added
                    that of Troy. The two Palladiums, which had been the protectors of that city,
                    became the tutelary deities of Lavinium, and, in after ages, of the whole Roman
                    empire. The worſhip of Veſta was likewiſe introduced by Æneas ; and virgins,
                    from her called <hi rend="italic">Peflals,</hi> were appointed to keep a fire
                    continually burning in honour of that goddeſs. Jupiter, Venus, and many other
                    deities who had been revered in Troy, became, in all likelihood, known to the
                    Latins by means of Æneas; which gave occaſion to the poets of repreſenting him
                    under the character of a pious hero.</p>
                <p>While Æneas was thus employed, the Rutuli, ancient enemies of the Latin name,
                    entering into an alliance with Mezentius king of the Tyrrhenians, took the field
                    with a deſign to drive out thoſe new-comers, of whoſe power they began to
                    conceive .no ſmall jea-louſy. Æneas marched out againſt them at the head of his
                    Trojans and Latins. Hereupon a battle enſued, which laſted till night ; when
                    Æneas being puſhed to the banks of the Numicus, which ran cloſe by Lavinium, and
                    forced into that river, was there drowned, ſt he Trojans concealed his body ;
                    and pretending that he had vaniſhed away on a ſudden, made him paſs for a deity
                    among his credulous ſubjects, who accordingly erected a temple to him under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">'Jupiter In-diges.</hi></p>
                <p>Upon the death of Æneas, his fon Euryleon, called alſo <hi rend="italic">Aſcanius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lulus,</hi> aſcended the throne ; but
                    as the young king did not think it adviſable to venture a battle in the very
                    beginning of his reign, with a formidable enemy, who promiſed himſelf great
                    ſucceſs from the death of Æneas, he had the prudence to confine himſelf within
                    the walls of Lavinium, and to try whether he could, by an honourable treaty, put
                    an end to ſo dangerous a war. But the haughty Mezentius demanding of the Latins,
                    as one of the conditions of a peace, that they ſhould pay him yearly, by way of
                    tribute, all the wine produced in the territory of Latium, Aſcanius rejected the
                    propoſal with the utmoſh indignation ; and having cauſed all the vines
                    throughout his dominions to be conſecrated to Jupiter, and by that means put it
                    out of his power to comply with the enemy’s requeſt, he reſolved to make a
                    vigorous fally, and try whether he could, by force of arms, bring the inſulting
                    Tyrrhenian to more reaſonable terms. The main body of the enemy’s army was
                    encamped at ſome diſtance from Lavinium ; but Lauſus, the ſon of Mezentius,
                    with, the flower of their youth under his command, lay entrenched at the very
                    gates of the city. The Trojans, who had been long accuſtomed to make vigorous
                    ſallies, marching out in the night, attacked the poſt where Lauſus commanded,
                    forced his entrenchments, and obliged the troops he had with him to ſave.
                    themſelves by flying to the main body of the army encamped on the plain ; but
                    the unexpected arrival and·</p>

                <p>overthrow cſ their advance-guard ſtruck them with ſuch terror, that, inſtead of
                    ſtopping the flight of their companions, they fled with them, in great diſorder,
                    to the neighbouring mountains. The Latins purſued them, and in the purſuit
                    Lauſus was killed : whoſe death ſo diſcouraged Mezentius, that he immediately
                    ſued for peace ; which was granted him, upon condition, that for the future the
                    Tiber ſhould be the boundary between the Latin and Hetrurian territories.</p>
                <p>In the mean time Lavinia, who had been-leſt with child by Æneas, entertaining a
                    ſtrong jealouſy of the &gt;ambition of her ſon-in-law, retired to the woods,
                    and was there peaceably delivered of a fon, who, from his father, was named <hi
                        rend="italic"> Æneas·,</hi> and, from the place of his •birth, had the
                    ſurname of <hi rend="italic">Sylvius :</hi> hut as the queen’s •flight, who
                    had diſappeared on a ſudden, raiſed ſuſpi-cions at Lavinium prejudicial to the
                    reputation of Aſe canius, he uſed all poſſible means to remove them, cauſed
                    diligent ſearch to be made after Lavinia, calmed her fears, and prevailed upon
                    her to return to trie town with her ſon, whom he ever after treated as a
                    brother. Lavinium grew every day more populous ; but as it •was in reality the
                    patrimony of Lavinia, and the inheritance of her ſon Sylvius, Aſcanius reſolved
                    to refιgn it to them, and build elſewhere another city for himſelf. This he
                    ∙made.the place of his reſidence, and the capital of his new kingdom, calling it <hi rend="italic">Alba Longa ; Alba,</hi> from a white ſow, which we are
                    told Æneas .had found in the place where it was built ; and <hi rend="italic">Longa,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from another town of the ſame name in the
                    country of the Marſi ; or rather, becauſe it ex- <hi rend="sub">l</hi> tended,
                    without having much breadth, the whole length . of a lake near which it was
                    built. It was 30 years after the building of Lavinium that Aſcauius fixed his :
                    abode at Alba ; and there he died, after a reign of -.about 38 years, 12 of
                    which he had reſided at his new ſettlement. He left a ſon called <hi
                        rend="italic"> lulus ;</hi> ſo that between him and Sylvius lay the right
                    of ſucceſſion to the Latin throne; the latter being the ſon, and the former the
                    grandſon, of Æneas.</p>
                <p>Ί he Latins not thinking it their intereſt to continue divided, as it were, into
                    two ſtates, reſolved to unite Alba and Lavinium into one ſovereignty ; and as
                    Sylvius was born of Lavinia the daughter of Latinus, and •had thereby an
                    undoubted title to the kingdom of his grandfather, whereas the other was but the
                    ſon of a ſtranger, the Latins beſtowed the crown on Sylvius ; and, to make lulus
                    ſome amends, decreed to him the ſovereign power in affairs of religion j a power
                    which thenceforth continued in his family. Sylvius was ſucceeded by 13 kings of
                    the ſame race, who for near 400 years reigned at Alba ; but we ſcarce know any
                    thing of them beſides their names, and the years of their re-ſpective reigns.
                    Æneas Sylvius died, after a reign of 29 yeaιs. His ſon, called alſo <hi
                        rend="italic"> Æneas Sylvius,</hi> governed Latium 31 years. <hi
                        rend="italic"> Latinus Sylvius,</hi> who ſucceeded him, ſwayed the ſceptre
                    for the ſpace of 5 t years — Alba reigned 39 ; Capetus, by Livy named <hi
                        rend="italic"> Atys, 26;</hi> Gapis, 28 ; and Capetus, 13. Tſherinus, who
                    ſucceeded him, engaged in a war which proved fatal to him ; for in a battle
                    which was ſought on the banks of the Albula, he was forced into that river and
                    drowned. From him the river took the name of <hi rend="italic">Tiber,</hi> which it has borne ever ſince. Agrippa ſucceeded Tiberimιs after a reign of
                    eight years ; and left the throne, which</p>
                <p>he had held 4 r years, to Alladius ; who retgned 19, and was ſucceeded by
                    Aventinus, who leſt his name to the bill Aventinus, where he was interred.
                    Procas, who ſucceeded him, and reigned 23 years, wa9 the father of Numitor and
                    Amulius ; and at his death bequeathed the throne to his elder ſon Numitor. But
                    Amulius, who ſurpaſſed his brother in courage and underſtanding, drove him from
                    the throne ; and to ſecure it to himſelf, murdered Ægeftus, Numitor’s only ſon,
                    and conſecrated his daughter Rhea Sylvia to the worſhip of Veſta, by which ſhe
                    was obliged to perpetual virginity. But this precaution proved ineffectual ; for
                    as the Veſ-tal was going to a neighbouring ſpring to fetch water for the
                    performance of a ſacriſice to Mars, ſhe was met and raviſhed by a man in a
                    military habit, like that iu which the god Mars is repreſented. Some authors
                    think that this counterfeit Mars was a lover come thither by her appointment ;
                    others charge Amulius him-ſelſ with uſing this violence to his niece, not ſo
                    much to gratify his luit, as to have a pretence to deſtroy her.— For ever after
                    he cauſed her to be carefully watched, till ſhe was delivered of two ſons ; and
                    then exaggerating her crime in an aſſembly of the people, he prevailed upon them
                    to fentenςe her to death, and to condemn the fruit of her criminal amour to be
                    thrown into the Tiber. The ſentence againſt Rhea was, according to ſome authors,
                    changed by Amulius, at the requeſt of his daughter Antho, into perpetual
                    confinement, but executed againſt the twins ; who being laid in a wooden trough,
                    and carried to the foot of mount Palatine, were there turned adrift on the
                    Tiber, which at that time overflowed its banks. But the wind and ſtream proved
                    both ſo favourable, that at the fall of the water the two infants were left ſafe
                    on the ſtrand, and were there happily found by Fauſtulus, the chief of the
                    king’s ſhepherds, and ſuckled by his wife Acca Laurentia, who for her diſorderly
                    life was called <hi rend="italic">Lupa ;</hi> and this probably gave rife to
                    the fabulous miracle of their being nurſed by a wolf.</p>
                <p>As Fauſtulus was probably well acquainted with the birth of the twins, he took
                    more than ordinary care of their education, and ſent them to Gabii to be
                    inſtructed there in Greek literature. As they grew up, they appeared to have
                    ſomething great in their mien and air which commanded reſpect ; and the
                    aſcendant which they aſſumed over the other ſhepherds made them dreaded in the
                    ſoreſts, where they exerciſed a ſort of empire. A quarrel happening between the
                    herdſmen of Amulius and thoſe of Numitor, the two brothers took the part of the
                    former againſt the latter ; and ſome blood being ſhed in the fray, the adverſe
                    party, to be revenged on <hi rend="italic">Romulus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Remus</hi> (for ſo the twins were called), on the feſtival of Lupercalia,
                    ſurpriſed Remus, and carried him before Numitor, to be puniſhed according to his
                    deſerts. But Numitor feeling himſelf touched in the priſoner’s favour, aſked him
                    where he was born, and who were his parents. His anſwer immediately ſtruck
                    Numitor with a lively remembrance of his two grand-ſons ; their age, which was
                    about 1 8 years, agreed with the time when the two infants were expoſed upon the
                    Tiber ; and there needed no more to change his anger into tenderneſs.</p>
                <p>In the mean time Romulus, eager to reſcue his brother, and purſue thoſe who had
                    carried him off, was preparing to be revenged on them ; but Fauſtulus diſ-</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0329" facs="gri_33125011196389_0335.tif"/>
                <p>ſuaded him ſrom it ; and on that occaſion, diſcloſing to him his birth, awakened
                    in his breaſt ſentiments worthy of his extraction. He reſolved, at all
                    adventures, to attempt the delivering of his mother and grandfather from
                    oppreſſion. With this view he aſſembled the country people, over whom he had
                    aſſumed a kind of ſovereignty, and engaged them to come to the city on an
                    appointed day, and enter it by different gates, provided with arms, which they
                    were to conceal. While Romulus was thus diſpoſing every thing for the execution
                    of his deſign, Numitor made the ſame diſeovery to Remus concerning his parents,
                    and the oppreſſions they groaned under ; which ſo fired him, that he was ready
                    to embark in any enterpriſe. But Numitor took care to moderate the tranſports of
                    his grandſon, and only deſired him to acquaint his brother with what he had
                    heard fιom him, and to ſend him to his houſe. Romulus ſoon came, and was
                    followed by Fauſtulus, who took with'him the trough or ſkiſſ in which the twins
                    had been expoſed, to ſhow it to Numitor : but, as the ſhep-herd betrayed an air
                    of concern and earneſtneſs in his looks, he was flopped at the gate of the city,
                    led before Amulius, and examined concerning his burden. It was eaſily known by
                    its make and inſcription, which was ſtill legible ; and therefore Fauſtulus
                    owned what it was, and conſeſſed that the twins were living ; but, in order to
                    gain time, pretended that they were feeding flocks in a remote deſert. In the
                    mean time, the uſurper’s death being reſolved on, Remus undertook to raiſe the
                    city, and Romulus to inveſt the king’s palace. The country people came at the
                    time appointed, and formed themſelves into companies each conſiſting of ιoo men.
                    They had no other enſigns but bundles of hay hanging upon long poles, which the
                    Latins at that time called <hi rend="italic">manipuli</hi> ; and hence came
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">mαnipu∙ lares,</hi> originally given to troops
                    raiſed'in the country. With this tumultuous army Romulus beſet the avenues of
                    the palace, forced the guard, and having killed the tyrant, after he had reigned
                    42 years, reſtored his grandfather Numitor to the throne.</p>
                <p>Affairs being thus ſettled at Alba, the two brothers, by the advice of Numitor,
                    undertook the founding of a new colony. The king beſtowed on them thoſe lands
                    near the Tiber where they had been brought up, ſupplied them with all manner of
                    inſtruments for breaking up ground, with ſlaves, and beaſts of burden, and
                    granted full liberty to his ſubjects to join them. Hereupon moſt of the Trojans,
                    of whom there ſtill remained 50 families in Auguſtus’s time, choſe to follow the
                    fortune of Romulus and Remus, as did alſo the inhabitants of Pallantium and
                    Saturnia, two ſmall towns. For the more ſpeedy carrying on of the work, it was
                    thought proper to divide thoſe who were to be employed in the building of the
                    city into two companies, one under the command of Romulus, the other of Remus ;
                    but this diviſion, which was deſigned purely with a view to the public welfare,
                    and that the two parties might work by way of emulation, gave birth to two
                    factions, and produced a jealouſy between the two brothers, which broke out when
                    they came to chooſe a place for the building of their new city ; for Remus was
                    for the Aventine, and Romulus for the Palatine mount. Upon which, the matter
                    being referred to their grandfather, he adviſed the contending parties to have
                    recourſe to the gods, and to put an end to the diſpute by augury, to which he
                    wa∙ himſelf greatly addicted. The day appointed for the ceremony being come, the
                    brothers poſted themſelves each upon his hill ; and it was agreed, that whoever
                    ſhould ſee the firſt flight, or the greateſt number, of vultures, ſhould gain
                    his cauſe. After the two rival» had waited ſome time for the appearance of a
                    favourable omen, Romulus, before any had appeared, ſent to acquaint his brother
                    that he had ſeen ſome vultures ; but Remus, having actually ſeen ſix, while his
                    brother’s meſſengers were yet on their way, haſtened, on their arrival, to mount
                    Palatine, to examine the truth of what they had told him. He had no ſooner got
                    thither, than by an unexpected good fortune twelve vultures appeared to Romulus.
                    Theſe he immediately ſhowed to his brother ; and, tranſported with joy, deſired
                    him to judge himſelf of the truth of what his meſſengers had told him. However,
                    Remus diſcovered the deceit ; and, being told that Romulus had not ſeen the
                    twelve vultures till after he had ſeen ſix, he inſiſted on the time of his
                    ſeeing them, and the other on the number of birds he had ſeen. This widened the
                    breach between the two brothers ; and, their parties being divided, while each
                    man eſpouſed the cauſe of his leader, the diſpute grew ſo warm, that, ſrom words
                    they came at length to blows. The ſhepherd Fauſtulus, who was equally dear to
                    both the brothers, endeavouring to part the combatants, was by an unknown hand
                    laid dead on the ſpot. Some writers tell us, that Remus likewiſe loſt his life
                    in the fray ; but the greater number place his death later, and ſay that he was
                    killed by one Fabius, for having, in dcriſion, leaped over the wall of the new
                    city : but Livy ſays, the more common report was, that Remus ſell by the hand of
                    his brother.</p>
                <p>Romulus, being now head of the colony, by having got the better of his brother’s
                    party in the late engagement, applied his thoughts wholly to the <hi rend="sup">z</hi> building of the city, which he propoſed to call after his own name.
                    He choſe mount Palatine for its ſituation, and performed all thoſe ceremonies
                    which the ſuperſtition of the Hetrurians had introduced. He firſt offered
                    ſacrifices to the gods, and ordered all the people to do the ſame : and from
                    that time decreed, that eagles ſhould be the auſpices of his new colony. After
                    this, great fires were kindled before their tents, and all the people leaped
                    through the flames to purify themſelves. When this ceremony was over, they dug a
                    trench round the ſpot where the aſſemblies of the people were afterwards held,
                    and threw into it the firſt-ſruits of whatever they were allowed to make uſe of
                    for food : every man of the colony was ordered to eaſt into the ſame trench an
                    handful of earth, brought either from his own or ſome neighbouring country. The
                    trench they called <hi rend="italic">Mundus,</hi> that is, <hi rend="italic">the world,</hi> and made it the centre round which the city was to be
                    built. Then Romulus, yoking an ox and a cow to a plough, the coulter whereof was
                    braſs, marked out, by a deep furrow, the whole compaſs of the city. Theſe two
                    animals, the ſymbols of marriage, by which cities are peopled, were afterwards
                    ſlain upon the altar. All the people followed the plough, throwing inwards the
                    clod« of earth which the plough-ſhare ſometimes turned outwaιds. Wherever a gate
                    was to be made, the plough was lifted up, and carried ; and hence came the Latin
                    word <hi rend="italic">porta, <hi rend="sup">ti</hi> v.</hi> gate,” de-</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0330" facs="gri_33125011196389_0336.tif"/>
                <p>rived from the verb <hi rend="italic">portare,</hi> “ to carry’.” As mount
                    Palatine ſtood by itſelf, the whole was incloſed within the line made by the
                    plough, which formed almoſt the figure of a ſquare ; whence, by Dionyſius
                    Halicarnaf-ſenſis, it is called <hi rend="italic">Roma ſſyadrata.</hi></p>
                <p>As to the exact year of the foundation of Rome, there is a great diſagreement
                    among hiſtorians and chronolo-gers. Fabius Pictor, the moſt ancient of all the
                    Roman writers, places it in the end of the ſeventh Olympiad ; that is, according
                    to the computation of Uſher, in the year of the world 3256, of the flood 1600,
                    and 748 before the Chriſtian sera. The Romans, if we may ſo call them, began to
                    build, as Plutarch and others inform us, on the 2tſt of April; which day was
                    then conſecrated to Pales, goddeſs of the ſhephercls ; whence the feſtival of
                    Pales, and that of the foundation of the city, were afterwards jointly
                    celebrated at Rome.</p>
                <p>When Rome had received the utmoſt perfection which its poor and rude founder
                    could give it, it conſiſted of about 1000 houſes, or rather huts ; and was
                    properly ſpeaking a beggarly- village, whereof the principal inhabitants
                    followed the plough, being obliged to cultivate with their own hands the
                    ungrateful ſoil of a barren country which they had ſhared among themſelves. Even
                    the walls of Romulus’s palace were made of ruſhes, and covered with thatch. As
                    every one had choſen his ground to build upon, without any regard to the
                    regularity and beauty of the whole, the ſtreets, if we may ſo call them, were
                    both crooked and narrow. In ſhort, Rome, till it was rebuilt after the burning
                    of it by the Gauls, was rather a diſorderly heap of huts, than a city built with
                    any regularity or order.</p>
                <p>As ſoon as the building of the city was finiſhed, Romulus aſſembled the people,
                    and deſired them to chooſe what kind of government they would obey. At that time
                    monarchy was the unanimous voice of the Romans, and Romulus was elected king.
                    Before he aſcended the throne, however, he conſulted the will of the gods by
                    augury ; and having received a favourable anſwer, it thence became an
                    eſtabliſhed cuſtom to have recourſe to augury before the raiſing any one to the
                    dignity of king, prieſt, or any public employment. After this he applied himſelf
                    to the eſtabliſhment of good order and ſubordination among his ſubjects. He put
                    on a habit of diſtinction for himſelf, appointed j 2 lictors to attend him as
                    guards, divided his ſubjects, who at this time conſiſted only of 33,000 men,
                    into <hi rend="italic">curia. decurine. patricians, plebeians, patrons,
                        clients,</hi> &amp;c. for an account of which, ſee theſe articles as
                    they occur in the order of the alphabet. - After this he formed a ſenate
                    conſiſting of too perſons, choſen from among the patricians ; and a guard of }OO
                    young men called <hi rend="italic">celer es,</hi> who attended the king, and
                    ſought either on foot or on horſeback as occaſion required. The king’s office at
                    home was to take care of religious affairs, to be the guardian of laws and
                    cuſtoms ; to decide the weightier cauſes between man and man, referring thoſe of
                    ſmaller moment to the ſenate ; to call together the ſenators, and aſſemble the
                    people, firſt delivering his own opinion concerning the affair 1 e propoſed, and
                    then ratifying by his confient what was agreed on by the majority. Abroad, and
                    in the time of war, he was to command the army with abſolute authority, and to
                    take care of the public money. The ſenate were not only to be judges in matters

                <p>importance, but to debate and reſolve upon ſuch public affairs as the king
                    propoſed, and to determine them by a plurality of voices. The people were
                    allowed to create magiſtrates, enact laws, and reſolve upon any war which the
                    king propoſed ; but in all theſe things the confient of the ſenate was
                    neceſſary.</p>
                <p>Romulus next proceeded to ſettle the religious affairs of his people. Many of
                    the Trojan and Phry« gian deities were added to thoſe whom the Aborigines or
                    Italian natives already worſhipped. He choſe prieſts, inſtituted feſtivals, and
                    laid the foundation of a regular ſyſtem of religion ; after which, as his colony
                    was ſtill thinly peopled, he opened an aſylum for fugitive ſlaves, homicides,
                    outlaws, and debtors. Theſe, however, he did not at firſt receive within the
                    walls, but appointed for their habitation the hill Saturnius called afterward3 <hi rend="italic">Capitolinas,</hi> on which he erected a temple to a
                    divinity of his own invention, whom he named the <hi rend="italic">Alyleaη god,</hi> under whoſe protection all criminals were to live ſecure-ly. But
                    afterwards, when the city was enlarged, the aſylum was incloſed within the
                    walls, and thoſe who who dwelt in it included among the citizens of Rome.</p>
                <p>When Romulus had thus ſettled every thing relating to his new colony, it was
                    found that a ſupply of women was wanting to perpetuate its duration. This
                    occaſioned ſome difficulty ; for the neighbouring nations refuſed to give their
                    daughters in marriage to ſuch a crew of vagabonds as had ſettled in Rome ;
                    wherefore Romulus at laſt reſolved on the following expedient. By the advice of
                    his grandfather Numitor, and with thecon-ſent of the ſenate, he proclaimed a
                    ſolemn feaſt and public games in honour of the Equeſtrian Neptune called <hi
                        rend="italic"> Cotiſus.</hi> This occaſioned a great concourir of people,
                    who flocked from the adjacent parts to behold theſe pompous ſhows, together with
                    the new city. But, in the midſt of the ſolemnity, the Romane, ruſhing in with
                    their ſwords drawn, ſeized all the young women, to the number of 683, for whom
                    Romulus choſe huſhands. Among all thoſe who were thus ſeized, only one married
                    woman, named <hi rend="italic">Herlllia,</hi> was found ; and Romulus is ſaid
                    to have kept her ſor himſelf.</p>
                <p>This violence ſoon brought on a war with the neighbouring nations. Acron king of
                    Cænina, a city on the confines of Latium, having entered into a league with the
                    inhabitants of Cruſtuminum and Antemnæ, invaded the Roman territories. Romulus
                    marched againſt them without delay, defeated the confederate army, killed their
                    king in Angle combat, decreed himſelf a triumph, and conſecrated the ſpoils of
                    Acron to Jupiter Feretrius, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Opima Spolia.</hi> The city of Cænina was razed to the ground, and the inhabitants
                    tranſplanted to Rome, where they were admitted to the privileges of citizens.
                    The king then marched with one legion (conſiſting at this time of 3003 foot and
                    3so horſe) againſt the Cruſtumini and Antemnates, both of whom he defeated in
                    battle, and tranſplanted the inhabitants to Rome ; which being incapable of
                    holding ſuch a number, Romulus took in the hill Saturnius above-mentioned, on
                    the top of which he built a citadel, committing the care of it to a noble Roman
                    named <hi rend="italic">Tarpe&gt;us.</hi> The citadel was ſurrounded on
                    all ſides with ramparts and towers, which equally commanded the city and
                    country. From the loot of the hill Saturnius a wall was carried on quite to the
                    Tiber, and a gate</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0331" facs="gri_33125011196389_0337.tif"/>
                <p>opened in it named <hi rend="italic">Carmentalis,</hi> from Carmenta the
                    mother of Evander, who either lived there, or had ſome chapel or altar erected
                    to her.</p>
                <p>Romulus had now become ſo formidable to his neighbours, and had ſo well
                    eſtabliſhed his reputation for clemency, that ſeveral cities of Hetruria
                    voluntarily ſubmitted to him. Ccelius, an Hetrurian general, led the troops
                    under his command to Rome, and ſettled on an hill near the city, which from him
                    took the name of <hi rend="italic">Mount Callus.</hi> The Sabines, however,
                    not in the leaſt diſmayed at this increaſe of the Roman forces, ſent a
                    deputation to Romulus, demanding reſtitution of the young women who had been
                    carried off ; and, upon his refuſal, marched to Rome with an army of 25,000 foot
                    and xoco horſe, under the command of their king Titus Tatius. Romulus, having
                    received ſupplies from Numitor and from Hetruria, likewiſe took the field, with
                    20,000 foot and 800 horſe, with whom he ſeized an advantageons poſt, and
                    fortified himſelf ſo ſtrongly, that he could not be attacked. The Sabine
                    monarch, perceiving the military ſkill of Romulus, began to be apprehenſive of
                    the event ; but was extricated out of his difficulties by the treachery of
                    Tarpeia daughter to the governor of the citadel, who agreed to betray that
                    important fortreſs to the enemy, on condition of being rewarded with the
                    bracelets which the Sabines wore on their left arms. But when once they became
                    maſters of this important place, they are ſaid to have cruſlred Tarpeia under
                    the weight of their bucklers, pretending that thus they diſeharged their
                    promiſe, as they wore their bucklers alſo on their left arms. Ί he poſſeſſion of
                    the citadel enabled the Babines to carry on the war with more ſucceſs ; but, at
                    laſt, in a general engagement, they had the miſ-fortune to be driven back into
                    the citadel, whither they were purſued by the Romans, who expected to have
                    retaken that important poſt ; but the enemy, rolling down great ſtones from the
                    top of the hill, wounded Romulus on the head, ſo that he was carried inſenſible
                    out of the field of battle, while, in the mean time, his troops were repulſed,
                    and puiſuedto the very gates of Rome. However, the king ſoon recovering himſelf,
                    encouraged his routed troops, and drove the enemy back into the citadel. But
                    while the two nations were thus fiercely contending, the women, for whoſe cauſe
                    the war had been commenced, undertook the office of mediators ; and having
                    obtained leave from the ſenate, marched in a body to the camp of the Sabines,
                    where they pleaded the cauſe of their huſhands ſo effectually, that a treaty of
                    union between the two nations was ſet on foot, and a peace was at laſt
                    concluded, on the following terms. 1. That the two kings ſhould reſide and reign
                    jointly at Rome. 2. That the city ſhould ſtill, from Romulus, be called <hi
                        rend="italic"> Rome ;</hi> but the inhabitants <hi rend="italic">Quirites,</hi> a name till then peculiar to the Sabines. 3. That the two nations ſhould
                    become one ; and that the Sabines ſhould be made free in Rome, and enjoy all the
                    privileges of Roman citizens. As Rome was chiefly indebted for this increaſe of
                    her power and ſplendor to the Sabine women, honourable privileges and marks of
                    diſtinction were allowed them. Every one was commanded to give way to them ; in
                    capital cauſes they were exempted from the juriſdic-tion of the ordinary judges
                    ; and their childιen were allowed to wear a golden ball hanging from their
                    necks&gt;</p>
                <p>and a particular kind of robe called <hi rend="italic">prateχta,</hi> to
                    diſtinguiſh them from the vulgar.</p>
                <p>The two kings reigned with great harmony for the ſpace of five years; during
                    which time the only military exploit they accompliſhed was the reduction of the
                    city of Cameria, at a ſmall diſtance from Rome. Four thouſand of the Camerini
                    were tranſplanted to Rome, and a Roman colony ſent to repeople Cameria ; ſoon
                    after which the Sabine king was murdered by the Lavinians, on account of his
                    granting protection to ſome of his friends who had ravaged their territories.
                    The Lavinians, fearing the reſentment of Romulus, delivered up the aſſaſſins
                    into his hands ; but he ſent them back un-puniſhed, which gave occaſion to
                    ſuſpect that he was not diſpleaſed with the death of . his colleague.</p>
                <p>Soon after the death of Tatius, Rome was afflicted with famine and peſtilence,
                    which encouraged the Camerini to revolt ; but Romulus marching againſt them
                    ſuddenly, defeated them with the loſs of 6000 men. After which he attacked the
                    Fidenates, whoſe city ſtood about five miles from Rome, took their capital, and
                    made it a Roman colony. This drew upon him the reſentment of the Veientes, a
                    powerful nation in the neighbourhood, who claimed Fidenæ as within their
                    juriſdiction ; but their forces being defeated in two engagements, and a great
                    number of them taken priſoners, they were obliged to ſue for peace. Romulus
                    granted them a truce for 100 years, on condition that they delivered to him
                    ſeven ſmall towns on the Tiber, together with ſome ſalt-pits near the mouth of
                    that river, and ſent 50 of their chief citizens as hoſtages to Rome. The
                    priſoners taken in this war were all ſold for ſlaves.</p>
                <p>The remaining part of the life of Romulus was ſpent in making laws for the good
                    of his people ; but towards the latter end of his reign, being elated with
                    ſucceſs, he began to enlarge the bounds formerly ſet to his prerogative, and to
                    behave in an arbitrary manner. He paid no longer any regard to the voice of the
                    ſenate, but aſſembled them only for form’s ſake to ratify his commands. The
                    ſenate therefore conſpired to deſtroy him, and accompliſhed their puιpole while
                    he was reviewing his troops. A violent florin of hail and thunder diſperſed the
                    army ; and the ſenators taking this opportunity, when they were left alone with
                    the king, inſtantly killed him, and conveyed his body out of light. Some writers
                    tell us <hi rend="sub">;</hi> that, the better to conceal the fact, they cut
                    his body in pieces, each of them carrying away a part under his robe ; after
                    which they told the multitude, that their king was on a ſudden ſurrounded by
                    flame, and ſnatched up into heaven. This ſtratagem, however, did not ſatisfy the
                    ſoldiery, and violent diſturbances were about to enſue, when Julius Proculus, a
                    ſenator of great diſtinction, having aſſembled the Curiæ, told them that Romulus
                    had appeared to him, and enjoined him to acquaint the people, that their king
                    was returned to the gods from whom he originally came, but that he would
                    continue to be propitious to them under the name of <hi rend="italic">Quirinus
                        ;</hi> and to the truth of this ſtory Julius ſwore.</p>
                <p>Romulus reigned, according to the common computation, 37 years: but ſome
                    hiſtorians reduce the length of his reign to little more than 1 7 ; it being
                    very unlikely, as they obſerve, that a prince of ſuch an active diſpoſition
                    ſhould perform nothing worthy of</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0332" facs="gri_33125011196389_0338.tif"/>
                <p>record during a period of 20 years. Be this as it will, however, the death of
                    Romulus was followed by an interregnum, during which the ſenators, to prevent
                    anarchy and confuſion, took the government into their own hands. Tatius added
                    another hundred to that body ; and theſe 200 ſenators divided themſelves into
                    decuries or tens. Theſe decuries drew lots which ſhould govern firſt ; and the
                    decury to whoſe lot it fell enjoyed the ſupreme authority for five days ; yet in
                    ſuch a manner, that one perſon only of the governing decury had the enſigns of
                    ſovereignty at a time. To theſe another decury ſucceeded, each of them fitting
                    on the throne in his turn, &amp;c. But the people ſoon growing weary of ſuch
                    frequent change of maſters, obliged the ſenate to reſolve on the election of a
                    king. The ſenate referred the election to the people, and the people to the
                    ſenate, who at laſt undertook the taſlc. Some difficulties, however, occurred :
                    the Remans did not chooſe to be ſubject to a Sabine ; and the Sabines, as they
                    had been ſubject to Romulus after the death of Tatius, inſiſted that the king
                    ſhould be choſen out of their nation. At laſt it was agreed, that the king
                    ſhould be a Sabine, but that the Romans ſhould make the choice.</p>
                <p>In conſequence of this determination, the Romans elected Numa Pompilius, an
                    auſtere philoſopher, who had married Tatia, the daughter of Tatius the late
                    king. After the death of his wife, he gave himſelf entirely up to philoſophy and
                    ſuperſtition, wandering from ſolitude to ſolitude, in ſearch of ſacred woods and
                    fountains, which gave the people a great opinion of his fanctſty. The
                    philoſopher at firſt rejected the offer of the kingdom ; but being at laſt
                    prevailed upon, he ſet out for Rome, where he was received with loud
                    acclamations, and had his election unanimouſiy confirmed by the ſenate.</p>
                <p>The reign of Numa is by no means memorable for battles or conqueſts. He was
                    averſe to war ; and made it his ſtudy to ſoften the manners of the Romans,
                    rather than to exalt them to ſuperiorſty over their neighbours. He diſmiſſed the
                    celeres, encouraged agriculture, and divided the citizens into diſtinct bodies
                    of tradeſmen. This laſt meaſure he took on purpoſe to aboliſh the diſtinction
                    between Romans and Sabines, which had hitherto rent the city into two factions ;
                    and this effectually anſwered his end : for now all of tach particular
                    profeſſion, whether Romans or Sabines, were obliged to aſſociate together, and
                    had each their reſpective courts and privileges. In this diviſion the muſicians
                    held the firſt rank, becauſe they were employed in the offices of religion. The
                    goldſmiths, carpenters, curriers, dyers, taylore, &amp;c. formed alſo
                    diſtinct communities ; and were allowed to make byelaws among themſelves, to
                    have their own feſtivals, particular ſacrifices, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Though Numa himſelf is ſaid by Plutarch to have had pretty juſt notions of the
                    Supreme Being, he nevertheleſs added innumerable ſuperſtitions to thoſe he found
                    in Rome. He divided the miniſters of religion into eight claſſes, appointing to
                    each their office with the greateſt preciſion ; he erected a temple to Janus,
                    the ſymbol of prudence, which was tθι remain open in time of war, and to be ſhut
                    in time of peace. Another temple was erected to <hi rend="italic">Bona Fides ;</hi> and he invented a new kind of deities called <hi rend="italic">Dii
                        Termini,</hi> or</p>
                <p>boundaries, which he cauſed to be placed on the borde rs of the Roman ſtate, and
                    of each man’s particular lands.—The laſt reformation which Numa undertook, was
                    that of the kalendar. Romulus had divided his year into ten months, which,
                    according to Plutarch, had no certain or equal number of days ; ſome conſiſting
                    of 20, ſome of 35, &amp;c. However, by other hiſtorians, we are informed
                    that he allotted to March,</p>
                <p>. May, Quintilis, and October, 31 days ; to April, June, Sextilis, November, and
                    December 30 ; making in all 304 days. But Numa being better acquainted <hi
                        rend="sub"> t</hi> with the celeſtial motions, added to theſe the two
                    months of January and February. To compoſe theſe two months he added 50 days to
                    the 304 ; and thus made the year anſwer to the courſe of the moon. He then took
                    fix more from the months that had even days ; and added one day merely out of
                    ſuperſtition, that the year might prove fortunate ; for the pagans looked upon
                    even numbers as unlucky, but imagined odd numbers to be fortunate. However, he
                    could make out no more than 28 for February, and therefore that month was always
                    reckoned unlucky among the Romans. Beſides this, he obſerved the difference
                    between the ſolar and lunar year to be 1 r days ; and to remedy the inequality,
                    he added an intercalary month named <hi rend="italic">Mercedinus</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic"> Mercedonius,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">22</hi> days every
                    two years : but as he knew alſo that the ſolar year conſiſted of 363 days 6
                    hours, he ordered that every fourth year the month Mercedinus ſhould conſiſt of
                    23 days. The care of theſe intercalations was left to the prieſts, who left out
                    or put in the intercalary day or month as they imagined it to be lucky or
                    unlucky ; and by that means created ſuch confuſion, that the feſtivals came in
                    proceſs of time to be kept at a ſeaſon quite oppoſite to what they had been
                    formerly.</p>
                <p>Theſe are all the remarkable tranſactions of the reign of Numa, which is ſaid to
                    have continued 43 years ; though ſome think that its duration could not be above
                    15 or 16. His death was followed by a ſhort interregnum; after which Tullus
                    Hoſtilius, the ſon or grandſon of the famous Herlllia, was unanimouſiy choſen
                    king. Being of a bold and fiery temper, he did not long continue to imitate his
                    peaceful predeceſſor. The Albans, indeed, ſoon gave him an opportunity of
                    exerciſiug his martial diſpoſition. Cœlius, or, as he is called by Livy, <hi
                        rend="italic"> Cluilius,</hi> who was at the head of the Alban republic,
                    jealous of the growing greatneſs of Rome, privately commiſſioned ſome of the
                    moſt indigent of his ſubjects to waſte the Roman territory ; in conſequence of
                    which, a Roman army entered the territories of Alba, engaged the robbers, killed
                    many, and took a great number priſoners. A war ſoon commenced, in conſequence of
                    this, between the two nations ; but when the armies came in fight of each other,
                    their ardour cooled, neither of them ſeeming inclined to come to an engagement.
                    This inaction raiſed a great diſcontent in the Alban army againſt Cluilius ;
                    inſomuch that he came to a reſolution of giving battle to the Romans next
                    morning, or of ſtorming their trenches if they ſhould decline it. Next morning,
                    however, he was found dead in his bed ; after which the Albans choſe in hi«
                    ſtead one Mettus Fuffetius, a man remarkable for his hatred to the Roman name,
                    as Cluilius had been before him, Fuffetius, however continued in the ſamr</p>

                <p>ſtate of inactivity as his predeceſſor, until he received certain intelligence
                    that the Veientes and Fidenates had .reſolved to deſtroy both Romans and Albans
                    when they ſhould be weakened by a battle. Fuffetius then reſolved to come to an
                    accommodation with the Romans ; and, having obtained a conference with Tullus,
                    both ſeemed equally deſirous of avoiding the calamities of war. But, in order to
                    eſtabliſh the peace on the moſt perfect foundation, Tullus propoſed that all, or
                    at leaſt the chief families in Alba, ſhould remove to Rome ; or, in caſe they
                    were unwilling to leave their native city, that one common council ſhould be
                    eſtabliſhed to govern both cities, under the direction of one of the two
                    ſovereigns. Fuffetius took aſide thoſe who attended him, to conſult with them
                    about this piopoſal; but they, though willing to come to an accommodation with
                    Rome, abſolutely refuſed to leave Alba. The only difficulty remaining, then, was
                    to ſettle which city ſhould have the ſuperiority ; and, as this could not be
                    determined by argument, Tullus propoſed to determine it by ſingle combat betwixt
                    himſelf and Fuffetius. This propoſal, however, the Alban general thought proper
                    to decline ; and it was at laſt agreed, that three champions ſhould be choſen
                    out of each camp to decide the difference. This produced the famous combat
                    between the Horatii and Curiatii, by which the ſovereignty was decided in favour
                    of Rome. See Horatii.</p>
                <p>Tullus now reſolved to call the Fidenates to an account for their treacherous
                    behaviour during the war with Alba, and therefore cited them to appear before
                    the ſenate ; but they, conſcious of their guilt, refuſed to appear, and took up
                    arms in conjunction with the Veientes. Fuffetius, in obedience to the orders of
                    Tullus, joined him with the Alban troops ; but the day before the battle, he
                    acquainted the principal officers with his deſign, which was to ſtand neuter
                    till fortune had declared ſor one ſide, and then to join with the conqueror.
                    'Γhis deſign being approved, Fuffetius, during the engagement, retired with his
                    forces to a neighbouring eminence. Tullus perceived his treachery ; but
                    diſſembling his uneaſineſs, told his men that Fuffetius had poſſeſſed himſelf of
                    that hill by his order, and that he was from thence to ruſh down upon the enemy.
                    The Veientes, in the mean time, who had expected that Fuffetius was to join
                    them, were diſmayed, and the Romans obtained the victory. After the battle,
                    Tullus returned privately to Rome in the night ; and having conſulted with the
                    ſenate about the treachery of Fuffetius, returned to the camp by break of day.
                    He then detached Horatius, who had conquered the three Curiatii, with a choſen
                    body of horſe and foot, to demoliſh Alba, as had been concerted at</p>
                <p>Rome. In the mean time, he commanded both the Roman and Alban troops to attend
                    him unarmed, but gave private orders to the Romans to bring their ſwords
                    concealed under their garments. When they were aſſembled, he laid open the
                    treachery. of Fuffetius» and ordered him to be torn in pieces by horſes. His
                    accomplices were all put to the ſword.;. and the inhabitants of Alba carried to
                    Rome, where they were admitted to the privileges of citizens, andTυme of them
                    even admitted to the ſenate.</p>
                <p>Tullus now turned his arms againſt Fidenæ, which lie again reduced under the
                    Roman yoke ; and took</p>
                <p>Medulia, a ſtrong city of the Latins ; after which he waged a ſucceſsful war
                    with the Sabines, whoſe union with the Romans ſeems to have ceaſed with the time
                    of Numa. This was the laſt of his martial exploits ; after which we hear no more
                    of him, but that he became extremely ſuperſtitious in his advanced years, giving
                    ear to many fooliſh ſtories, as that it rained ſtones, that miraculous voices
                    were heard from heaven, &amp;c. and for this he appointed nine days
                    expiatory ſacrifices ; whenoe it became a cuſtom to appoint nine days to appeaſe
                    the wrath of the gods as often as men were alarmed with prodigies. As to the
                    manner of his death authors are not agreed. Some tell us that he was killed by
                    lightning, together with his wife, children, and his whole family ; while
                    others, are of opinion that he was murdered with his wife and children by Ancus
                    Martius who ſucceeded him. He died after a reign of 33 years, leaving the city
                    greatly increaſed, but the dominions much the ſame as they had been in the time
                    of Romulus.</p>
                <p>After a ſhort interregnum, Ancus Martius, the grandſon of Numa by his daughter
                    Pompilia, and Marcus his relation, was unanimouſiy choſen by the people and
                    ſenate. Though naturally inclined to war, he began his reign with attempting to
                    reſtore the ceremonies of Numa, which had been neglected under Tullus Hoſtilius.
                    He endeavoured alſo to draw the attention of his people to huſhandry and the
                    peaceful arts ; adviſing them to lay aſide all ſorts of violence, and to return
                    to their former employments. This gained him the affections of his ſubjects, but
                    brought upon him the contempt of the neighbouring nations. The Latins,
                    pretending that their treaty with Rome was expired, made inroads into the.Roman
                    territories. Ancus, after uſing the ceremonies directed by Numa, took the field
                    with an army conſiſting entirely of- new levied troops, and reduced the cities
                    of Politorium, Tille-na, and Ficana, tranſplanting the inhabitants to Rome. A
                    new colony of Latins repeopled Politorium ; but Ancus retook the place next
                    year, and entirely demυ-liſhed it. Hc then laid ſiege to Medulia ; which, though
                    it had been ruined by Tullus Hoſtilius, was now ſtronger than ever. It
                    ſubmitted.after a ſiege ot four years, when Ancus found himſelf obliged to
                    undertake a ſecond expedition againſt Ficana, which he had before reduced, as we
                    have already related ; and it was not without the utmoſt difficulty that he
                    reduced it a ſecond time. After this he defeated the Latins in a pitched battle
                    ; vanquiſhed the Fidenates, Veientes, and Sabines ; and having taken in the hill
                    Janiculum to he included within the walls, and built the port of Gſtia, he died
                    in the 24th year of his reign.</p>
                <p>Ancus Martius left two ſons behind him, one an infant, and the other about 15
                    years of age. Both of theſe he put under the tuition of Tarquin, the ſon of a
                    rich merchant in Corinth,, who had fled from that city to ſecure his wealth ſrom
                    Cypſelus tyrant of the place. He ſettled in Tarquinii, one of the principal
                    cities in Hetruria ; but finding that he could not there attain to any of the
                    principal polls in the city on account of his foreign extraction, he removed to
                    Rome, where be had been gradually raiſed to the rank of patrician and ſenator.
                    The death of Ancus Martins gave him an opportunity of afliιming the regal
                    dignity, and ſetting aſide h.s pupils and in the beginning of his reign he</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0334" facs="gri_33125011196389_0340.tif"/>
                <p>took care to ſtrengthen his party in the ſenate by adding another hundred to
                    that body. Theſe were called <hi rend="italic">ſenator es miηorum gentium,</hi> becauſe they were choſen out of the plebeians ; however, they had the ſame
                    authority in the ſenate as the others, and their children were called <hi
                        rend="italic"> patridaηs.</hi></p>
                <p>Tarquin was not inferior to any of his predeceſſors either in his inclination or
                    abilities to carry on a war. As ſoon as he aſcended the throne, he recommenced
                    hoſtilities with the Latins ; from whom he took the cities of Apiolas,
                    Cruſtuminum, Nomentum, and Collatia. The inhabitants of Apiolse were ſold for
                    Haves ; but thoſe of Cruſtuminum and Nomentum, who had ſubmitted after their
                    revolt, were treated with great clemency. The inhabitants of Collatia were
                    diſarmed, and obliged to pay a large ſum of money ; the ſovereignty of it, in
                    the mean time, being given to Egerius, the ſon of Arunx, Tarquin’s brother; ſrom
                    whence he took the name of <hi rend="italic">Collatinus,</hi> which he
                    tranſmitted to his poſterity. Corniculum, another city of Latium, was taken by
                    ſtorm, and reduced to aſhes. This progreſs having greatly alarmed the Latins,
                    ſeveiwl of them joined their forces in order to oppoſe ſuch a formidable enemy ;
                    but being defeated in a bloody battle near Fi-denæ, they were obliged to enter
                    into an alliance with Rome ; upon which the Latins having held a national
                    conference, entered into a league with the Hetrurians, and again took the field
                    with a very numerous army. But Tarquin, having defeated the confederate armies
                    in two very bloody battles, obliged the Latin cities to ſubmit to a kind of
                    dependence on Rome ; and, having entered the city in triumph, built the circus
                    maximus with the ſpoils which he had taken from the enemy.</p>
                <p>The war with the Latins was ſcarce ended, when another commenced with Hetruria.
                    This was accounted the moſt powerful nation in Italy, and was at that time
                    divided into 12 tribes or lucomonies. Theſe appointed a national aſſembly, in
                    which it was decreed that the whole force of Hetruria ſhould be employed againſt
                    Tarquin ; and if any city preſumed only to ſtand neuter, it ſhould be for ever
                    cut off from the national alliance. Thus a great army was raiſed, with which
                    they ravaged the Roman territory, and took Fidenæ by the treachery of ſome of
                    its inhabitants. Tarquin, not being in a condition to oppoſe them at firſt, was
                    obliged to ſubmit to jthe loſs occaſioned by their ravages for a whole year ;
                    after which he took the field with all the forces he could raiſe. The Roman army
                    was divided into two bodies, one under the king himſelf, the other commanded by
                    his nephew Collatinus. The latter, having divided his forces in order to plunder
                    the country, was defeated ; but Tarquin, in two engagements, vanquiſhed the army
                    which oppoſed him. He then marched againſt Fidenæ, where he gained a third
                    battle ; after which he took the city. Such of the citizens as were ſuſpected to
                    have been concerned in betraying ſt to the enemy were whipped to death ; the
                    reſt were ſent into baniſhment, and their ∙ lands divided by lot among the Roman
                    ſoldiers. Tarquin now haſtened to oppoſe the new army of the Hetrurians before
                    their forces could be properly collected ; and having come up with them at
                    Ereturn, a place about jo miles from Rome, defeated them with great ſlaughter,
                    ſor which victory he was decreed a</p>
                <p>triumph by the ſenate 5 while the enemy, dlſlteartened by ſo many misfortunes,
                    were glad to ſue for peace ; which Tarquin readily granted, upon the ſole
                    condition of their owning his ſuperiorſty over them. In compliance with this,
                    the Hetrurians ſent him all the, enſigns of royalty which were in uſe among
                    them, viz. a crown of gold, a throne of ivory, a ſceptre with an eagle on the
                    top of it, a tunic embroidered with gold, and adorned with figures of palm
                    branches, together with a purple robe enriched with flowers of ſeveral colours.
                    Tarquin, however, would not wear theſe magnificent ornaments till ſuch time as
                    the ſenate and people had conſented to it by an expreſs law. He then applied the
                    regalia to the decoration of his triumph, and never afterwards laid them aſide.
                    In this triumph he appeared in a gilt chariot, drawn by four horſes, clothed in
                    a purple robe, and a tunic embroidered with gold, a crown on his head, and a
                    ſceptre in his hand, attended by 12 liétors with their axes and faſees.</p>
                <p>Tarquin, having now obtained ſome reſpite from war, applied himſelf to the
                    beautifying and ornamenting the city. He built the walls of Rome with hewn
                    ſtone, and erected thoſe famous common ſewers which have deſervedly been
                    accounted one of the wonders of the world. Rome at this time contained four
                    hills within its compaſt, viz. the Palatinus, Tarpeius, Qui-rinalis, and Cœlius.
                    In the valleys between theſe hills, the rain-water and ſprings uniting, formed
                    great pools which laid under water the ſtreets and public places. The mud
                    likewiſe made the way impaſſable, infected the air, and rendered the city
                    unhealthy. Tarquin undertook to free the city from this nuiſance, by conveying
                    off theſe waters by ſubterraneous channels into the Tiber. In doing this, it was
                    neceſſary to cut thro* hills and rocks a channel large enough for a navigable
                    ſtream, and covered with arches ſtrong enough to bear the weight of houſes,
                    which were frequently built upon them, and ſtood as firm as on the moſt ſolid
                    foundations. All theſe arches were made of hard ſtone, and neither trouble nor
                    expence were ſpared to make the work durable. Their height and bιeadth were ſo
                    conſiderable, that a cart loaded with hay could eaſily paſs through them under
                    ground. The expence of con-ſtructing theſe ſewers was never ſo thoroughly
                    underſtood as when it became neceſſary to repair them ; for then the cenſors
                    gave no leſs than 1000 talents to the perſen appointed for this purpoſe.</p>
                <p>Beſides theſe great works, Tarquin adorned the forum, ſurrounding it with
                    galleries in which were ſhops for tradeſmen, and building temples in it for the
                    youth of both ſexes, and halls ſor the adminiſtration of public juſtice. He next
                    engaged in a war with the Sabines, on pretence that they had aſſiſted the
                    Hetrurians. Both armies took the field, and came to an engagement on the
                    confines of Sabinia, without any conſiderable advantage on either ſide ; neither
                    was any thing-of conſequence done during the whole campaign. Tarquin then,
                    conſidering with himſelf that the Roman forces were very deficient in cavalry,
                    reſolved to add ſome new bodies of knights to thoſe already inſtituted by
                    Romulus. But this project met with great oppoſition from the ſuperſtitious
                    augurs, as the original diviſion of horſe into three bodies had been determined

                <p>the diviners at that time, violently oppoſed the king <hi rend="sup">,</hi> 3
                    will. On this Tarquin, deſirous to expoſe the deceit of theſe people, ſuramoned
                    Nævius before an aſſembly of the people, and deſired him to ſhow a ſpecimen of
                    his art, by telling the king if what he thought of at that time could be done or
                    not. The augur replied, after conſulting his birds, that the thing was very
                    poſſible. On which Tarquin told him, that he had been thinking whether it was
                    poſſible to cut a flint with a razor, pulling at the ſame time a razor and flint
                    from below his robe. This ſet the people a-laughing ; but Nævius gravely
                    deſiring the king to try it, he was ſurpriſed to find that the flint yielded to
                    the razor; and that with ſo much eaſe as to draw blood ſrom his hand. The people
                    teſtified their ſurpriſe by loud acclamations, and Tarquin himſelf continued to
                    have a great veneration for augurs ever after. A ſtatue of braſs was erected to
                    the memory of Nævius, which continued till the time of Auguſtus ; the razor and
                    flint were buried near it, under an altar, at which witneſſes were afterwards
                    ſworn in civil cauſes.</p>
                <p>This adventure, whatever was the truth of it, cauſed Tarquin to abandon his
                    deſign of increaſing the number of bodies of horſe, and content himſelf with
                    augmenting the number in each body. He then renewed the war with the Sabines,
                    ravaged their country, defeated them in three pitched battles, obliging them at
                    laſt to ſubmit to him and put him in poſſeſſion of their country. In the decline
                    of life he employed himſelf in further decorating the city, building temples,
                    &amp;c. He was aſſaſſinated in his palace, in the 8oth year of iιis age, by
                    the ſons of Ancus Martius, whom he had originally deprived of the kingdom.</p>
                <p>After the death of Tarquin I. his wife Tanaquil preſerved the kingdom to her
                    ſon-in-law Servius Tullius, by artfully giving out that the king was only
                    ſtunned, and would ſoon recover ; upon which the ſons of Ancus went voluntarily
                    into baniſhment. The ſecond day after his deceaſe, Servius Tullius heard cauſes
                    from the throne in the royal robes and attended by the lictors ; but as he
                    pretended only to ſupply the king’s place till he ſhould recover, and thought it
                    incumbent on him to revenge the wicked attempt upon his life, he ſummoned the
                    ſons of Ancus to appear before his tribunal ; and on their non-appearance,
                    cauſed them to be declared infamous, and their eſtates to be confiſca-ted. After
                    he had thus managed matters for ſome time in ſuch a manner as to engage the
                    affections of the people, the death of Tarquin was publiſhed as a thing that had
                    newly happened, and Servius Tullius aſſumed the enſigns of royalty, having none
                    to diſpute the honour with him.</p>
                <p>The new king ſhowed himſelf every way worthy of the throne. No ſooner were the
                    Hetrurians informed of Tarquin’s death, than they ſhook off the yoke ; but
                    Sdrvius quickly reduced them to obedience, depriving them of their lands, which
                    he ſhared among the poor Roman citizens who had none. For this he was decreed a
                    triumph by the people, in ſpite of the oppoſition of the ſenate, who could never
                    be brought to approve of his election to the kingdom, though he was ſoon after
                    legally choſen by the tribes.</p>
                <p>After Servius had obtained the fonction of the po pular voice, he marched a
                    ſecond time againſt the revolted Hetrurians ; and having again vanquiſhed them,</p>
                <p>was decreed another triumph. He then applied himſelf to the enlarging and
                    adorning the city. To the hills Palatinus, Tarpeius, Quirinalis, Cœlius, and
                    Aventinus, he added the Eſquilmus and Viminalis,. fixing his own palace, on the
                    Eſquilinus, in order to draw inhabitants thither. He likewiſe added a fourth
                    tribe, which he called <hi rend="italic">Tribus Eſquilina,</hi> to thoſe
                    inſtituted by Romulus. He divided alſo the whole Roman territory into diſtinct
                    tribes, commanding that there ſhould be at leaſt one place of refuge in each
                    tribe, ſituated on a riſing ground, and- ſtrong enough to ſecure the effects of
                    the peafonts in caſe of a ſudden alarm·. Theſe ſtrong-holds he called <hi
                        rend="italic"> pagi,</hi> that is, “ villages ;” and commanded that each of
                    them ſhould have their peculiar temple, tutelary god, and magiſtrates. Each of
                    them had likewiſe their peculiar feſtival, called <hi rend="italic">paga-ηαliα
                        ;</hi> when every perſen was to pay into the hands of thoſe who preſided at
                    the ſacrifices a piece of money, the men of one kind, the women of another, and
                    the children of a third. By this means an exact computation was made of the men,
                    women, and children, in each tribe.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, his two wards, Lucius Tarquinius and Afunx, the grandchildren
                    of Tarquin, being grown up, in order to ſecure their fidelity, he married them
                    to his two daughters. And though the elder of theſe daughters, who was of a mild
                    and tractable diſpoſition, reſembled in- character the younger of his pupils, as
                    the elder of his pupils did the younger of his daughters, who was of a violent
                    and vicious temper, yet he thought it adviſable to give his elder daughter to
                    Tarquin, and the younger to Arunx ; for by that means he matched them according
                    to their ages, and at the ſame time hoped that the elder Tullia’s ſweet
                    diſpoſition would temper Tarquin’s impetuoſity, and the younger Tullia’s
                    vivacity rouſe the indolence of A-runx.</p>
                <p>During the public rejoicing for this double marriage, the twelve lucumonies of
                    Hetruria uniting their forces, attempted to ſhake off the Roman yoke ; but were
                    in ſeveral battles defeated by Servius, and obliged to ſubmit to him on the ſame
                    conditions on which they had ſubmitted to his predeceſſor. For this ſucceſs
                    Servius was honoured with a third triumph.</p>
                <p>The king being thus diſengaged from a troubleſome war, returned to the purſuit
                    of his political ſchemes; and put in execution that maſterpiece of policy which
                    Rome made uſe of ever after, and which eſtabliſhed a perpetual order and
                    regularity in all the members of the ſtate, with reſpect to wars, to the public
                    revenues, and the ſuffrages of the comitia. I he public ſupplies had hitherto
                    been raiſed upon the people at ſo much an head, without any diſtinction of rich
                    and poor ; whence it likewiſe followed, that when levies were made for the war,
                    the rich and poor were equally obliged to take the field, according to the order
                    of their tribe ; and as they all ſerved at their own expence, the poorer fort
                    could hardly bear the charges of a campaign. Beſides, as the moſt indigent of
                    the people ſaw themſelves burdened with the lame taxes as the rich, they
                    pretended to an equal authority in the comitia : ſo that the election of kings
                    and magiſtrates, the making of peace or war, and the judging of criminals, were
                    given up into the hands of a populace who were eaſily corrupted, and had
                    notſiing to loſe. Bervιus formed a project to reme-</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0336" facs="gri_33125011196389_0342.tif"/>
                <p>dy theſe evils, and put it in execution, by enacting a law, enjoining all the
                    Roman citizens to bring in an account in writing of their own names and ages,
                    and of thoſe of their fathers, wives, and children. By the ſame law, all heads
                    of families were commanded to deliver in upon oath a juſt eſtimate of their
                    effects, and to add to it the places of their abode, whether in town or country.
                    Whoever did not bring in an account of his effects, was to be deprived of his
                    eſtate, to be beat with rods, and publicly ſold for a ſlave. Servius, ſrom theſe
                    particular accounts, which might be pretty well relied on, undertook to eaſe the
                    poor by burdening the rich, and at the ſame time to pleaſe the latter by
                    increaſing their power.</p>
                <p>To this end, he divided the Roman people into ſix claſſes : the firſt claſs
                    conſiſted of thoſe whoſe eſtates and effects amounted to the value of 10,000
                    drachmae, or 100,000 aſes of braſs; the firſt way of computing being uſed by the
                    Greeks, and the latter by the Latins. This claſs was ſubdivided into 8o
                    centuries, or companies of foot. To theſe Servius joined 18 centuries of Roman
                    knights, who fought on horſeback ; and appointed this conſiderable body of
                    horſemen to be at the head of the firſt claſs, becauſe the eſtates of theſe
                    Xknights, without all doubt, exceeded the ſum neceſſary to be admitted into it.
                    However, the public ſupplied them with horſes ; for which a tax was laid upon
                    widows, who were exempt from all other tributes. This firſt claſs, including
                    infantry and cavalry, conſiſted of 98 centuries. The ſecond claſs comprehended
                    thoſe whoſe eſtates were valued at $700 drachmae, or 75,000 aſes of braſs. It
                    was ſubdivided into 20 centuries, all foot. To theſe were added two centuries of
                    carpenters, ſmiths, and other artificers. In the third claſs were thoſe who were
                    eſteemed worth 5000 drachmae, or 50,000 aſes. This claſs was ſubdivided into 20
                    centuries. The fourth claſs was of thoſe whoſe effects were rated at the value
                    of 5co drachmæ, or 25,000 aſes, and was divided into 20 centuries ; to which
                    were added two other centuries of trumpets, and blowers of the horn, who
                    ſupplied the whole army with this martial muſic. The fifth claſs included thoſe
                    only whoſe whole ſubſtance did not amount to more than 1250 drachmæ, or 12,500
                    aſes; and this claſs was divided into 30 centuries. The ſixth claſs comprehended
                    all thoſe who w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> ere not worth ſo much as thoſe of the
                    fifth claſs : they exceeded in number any other claſs, but nevertheleſs were
                    reckoned but as one century.</p>
                <p>The king drew from theſe regulations all the advantages he had expected. Levies
                    ſor the army were no longer raiſed by tribes, nor were taxes laid at ſa much a
                    head a3 formerly, but all was levied by centuries. When, for inſtance, an army
                    of 20,000 men, or a large ſupply of money, was wanted for the war, each century
                    furniſhed its quota both of men and money r ſo that the firſt claſs, which
                    contained more centuries, though fewer men, than all the others together,
                    furniſhed more men and more money for the public ſervſee than the whole Roman
                    ſtate beſides. And by this means the Roman armies conſiſted for the moil part of
                    the rich citizens of Rome ; who, as they had lands and effects to defend, fought
                    w <hi rend="sup">r</hi> ith more reſolution, while their riches enabled them
                    to bear the expence of a campaign. As it was but juſt the king ſhould make the
                    firſtclaſs amends for the weight laid on it,</p>
                <p>he gave it almoſt the whole authority in ptιblic affairs ; changing the comitia
                    by curiæ, in which every man gave his vote, into comitia by centuries, in which
                    the majority was not reckoned by ſingle perſons, but by Centuries, how few
                    ſoever there might be in a century. Hende the firſt claſs, which contained more
                    centuries than the other five taken together, had every thing at its diſpoſal.
                    The votes of this claſs were firſt taken ; and if the 98 centuries happened to
                    agree, or only 97 of them, the affair was determined ; becauſe theſe made the
                    majority of the 193 centuries which compoſed the ſix claſſes. If they diſagreed,
                    then the ſecond, the third, and the other claſſes in their order, were called to
                    vote, though there was very ſeldom any occaſion to go ſo low as the fourth claſs
                    for a majority of votes ; ſo that by this good order Servius brought the affairs
                    of the ſtate to be determined by the judgment of the moſt conſiderable citizens,
                    who underſtood the public intereſt much better than the blind multitude, liable
                    to be impoſed upon, and eaſily corrupted.</p>
                <p>And now the people being thus divided into ſeveral orders, according to the
                    cenſus or valuation of their eſtates, Servius reſolved to ſolemnize this prudent
                    regulation by ſome public act of religion, that it might be the more reſpected
                    and the more laſting. Accordingly, all the citizens were commanded to appear, on
                    a day appointed, in the Campus Martius, which was a large plain, lying between
                    the city and the Tiber, formerly conſecrated by Romulus to the god Mars. Here
                    the centuries being drawn up in battalia, a ſolemn luſtratiort or expiatory
                    ſacriſice was performed in the name of all the people. The ſacriſice conſiſted
                    of a ſow, a ſheep, and a bull, whence it took the name of <hi rend="italic">ſuove-taurilia.</hi> The whole ceremony was called <hi rend="italic">lujlrum, à luendo ;</hi> that is, from paying, expiating, clearing, or
                    perhaps from the goddeſs Lua, who prefided over expiations, and to whom Servius
                    had dedicated a temple. This wiſe king conſidering, that in the ſpace of five
                    years there might be ſuch alterations in the fortunes of private perſons as to
                    entitle ſome to be raiſed to an higher claſs, and reduce others to a lower,
                    enjoined that the cenſus ſhould be renewed every five years. As the cenſus was
                    uſually cloſed by the luſtrum, the Romans henceforth began to compute time by
                    luſtrums, each luſtrum containing the ſpace of five years. However, the luſtrums
                    were not always regularly obſerved, but often put off, though the cenſus had
                    been made in the fifth year. Some writers are of opinion, that Servius at this
                    time coined the firſt money that had ever appeared at Rome ; and add, that the
                    circumſtances of the luſtrum probably led him to ſtamp the figures of the
                    animals there ſlain on pieces of braſs of a certain weight.</p>
                <p>The government of the city being thus eſtabliſhed in ſo regular a manner,
                    Servius, touched with compaſ-fion for thoſe whom the misfortunes of an
                    unſucceſsful war had reduced to ſlavery, thought that ſuch of them as had by
                    long and faithful ſervices deſerved and obtained their feeedom, were much more
                    worthy of being made Roman citizens, than untractable vagabonds from foreign
                    countries, who were admitted without diſtinction. He therefore gave the freedmen
                    their choice, either to return to their own country, or continue at Rome. Thoſe
                    who choſe to continue there, he divided into four tribes, and ſettled them
                    within the city ;</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0337" facs="gri_33125011196389_0343.tif"/>
                <p>and though they were diſtinguiſhed from the plebeians by their old name of <hi
                        rend="italic"> Hberti,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ſreedmen,</hi> yet they
                    enjoyed all the privileges of free citizens. The ſenate took offence at the
                    regard which the king ſhowed to fιιch mean people, who had but lately ſhaken off
                    their fetters ; but Servius, by a moſt humane and judicious diſcourſe, entirely
                    appeaſed the fathers, rvho paſſed his inſtitution into a law, which ſubliſted
                    ever after.</p>
                <p>The wiſe king, having thus eſtabliſhed order among the people, undertook at laſt
                    to reform the royal power itſelf ; his equity, which was the main ſpring of all
                    his reſolutions, leading him to act contrary to his own intereſt, and to
                    ſacriſice one half of the royal authority to the public good. His predeceſſors
                    had reſerved to themſelves the cognizance of all cauſes both public and private
                    ; but Servius, finding the duties of his office too much for one man to
                    diſcharge well, committed the cognizance of ordinary ſuits to the ſenate, and
                    reſerved that only of ſtate-crimes to himſelf.</p>
                <p>All things being now regulated at home, both in the city and country, Servius
                    turned his thoughts abroad, and formed a ſeheme for attaching the Sabines and
                    Latins to the Romans, by ſuch ſocial ties as ſhould be ſtrengthened by religion.
                    He ſummoned the Latin and Sabine cities to ſend their deputies to Rome, to
                    conſult about an affair of great importance. When they were come, he propoſed to
                    them the building of a temple in honour of Diana, where the Latins and Sabines
                    ſhould meet once a year, and join with the Romans in offering ſacrifices to that
                    goddeſs ; that this feſtival ſhould be followed by a council, in which all
                    diſputes between the cities ſhould be amicably determined ; that there proper
                    meaſures ſhould be taken to purſue their common intereſt ; and, laſtly, in order
                    to draw the common people thither, a fair ſhould be kept, at which every one
                    might furniſh himſelf with what he wanted. The king’s deſign met with no
                    oppoſition : the deputies only added to it, that the temple ſhould be an
                    inviolable aſylum ſor the united nations ; and that all the cities ſhould
                    contribute toward the expence of building it. It being left to the king to
                    chooſe a proper place for it, he pitched upon the Aventine hill, where the
                    temple was built, and aſſemblies annually held in it. The laws which were to be
                    obſerved in theſe general meetings were engraved on a pillar of braſs, and were
                    to be ſeen in Auguſtus’3 time, in the Latin tongue, but in Greek characters.</p>
                <p>But now Servius was grown old ; and the ambition of Tarquin his ſon-in-law
                    revived in proportion as the king advanced in years. His wife uſed her utmoſt
                    endeavours to check the raſhneſs and fury of her huſhand, and to divert him from
                    all criminal enterpriſes ; while her younger filter was ever inſtigating Arunx,
                    who placed all his happineſs in a private life, to the moſt villanous attempts.
                    She was continually lamenting her fate in being tied to inch an indolent
                    huſhand, and wiſhing ſhe had either continued unmarried, or were become a widow.
                    Similitude of temper and manners, formed, by degrees, a great intimacy between
                    her and Tarquin. At length ſhe propoſed nothing leſs to him than the murdering
                    of her father, ſiſter, and huſhand, that they two might meet and aſcend the
                    throne together. Soon after, they paved their way to an ince-ſtuous marriage, he
                    by poiſoning his wife, and ſhe her</p>
                <p>huſhand ; and then had the aſſurance to aik the king’s</p>
                <p>and queen’s confent to their marriage. Servius arid Tarquinia, though they did
                    not give it, were filent, through too much indulgence to a daughter in whom now
                    was their only hope of poſterity. But theſe criminal nuptials were only the
                    firſt ſtep towards a yet greater iniquity. The wicked ambition of the
                    new-married couple firſt ſhowed itſelf againſt the king : for they publicly
                    declared, that the crown belonged to them ; that Servius was an ufurpcr, who,
                    being appointed tutor to Tarquin’s grandchildren, had deprived his pupils of
                    their inheritance ; that it was high time for an old man, who was but little
                    able to ſupport the ' weight of public affairs, to give place to a prince who
                    was of a mature age, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The patricians, whom Servius had takert great pleaſure in humbling during the
                    whole time of his reign, were eaſily gained over to Tarquin’s party ; and, by
                    the help of money, many of the poorer citizens were alſo brought over to his
                    intereſt. The king, being informed of their treafonable practices, endeavoured
                    to diſſuade his daughter and ſon-indaw from ſuch proceedings, which might end in
                    their ruin ; and exhorted them to wait for the kingdom till his death. But they,
                    deſpiſing his counſels and paternal admonitions, reſolved to lay their claim
                    before the ſenate ; which Servius was obliged to ſummon : ſo that the affair
                    came to a formal proceſs. Tarquin reproached his father-in-law with having
                    aſcended the throne without a previous interregnum ; and with having bought the
                    votes of the people, and deſpiſed the ſuffrages of the ſenate. He then urged his
                    own right of inheritance to the crown, and injuſtice of Servius, who, being only
                    his guardian, had kept poiſeſſion of it, when he himſelf was of an age to
                    govern. Servius anſwered, that he had been lawfully elected by the people ; and
                    that, if there could be an hereditary right to the kingdom, the ſons of Ancus
                    had a much better one than the grandſons of the late king, who muſt himſelf have
                    been an uſurper. He then referred the whole to an aſſembly of the people ; which
                    being immediately proclaimed all over the city, the forum was ſoon filled ; and
                    Servius harangued the multitude in ſuch a manner as gained all their affections.
                    They all cried out with one voice, <hi rend="italic">Let Servius reign ; let
                        him continue to make the Romans happy.</hi> A-midſt their confuſed
                    clamours, theſe words were likewiſe heard : <hi rend="italic">Let Tarquin
                        periſh ; let him die; let us kill him.</hi> This language frightened him
                    ſo, that he retired to his houſe in great haſte ; while the king was conducted
                    back to his palace with the acclamations of the people.</p>
                <p>The ill ſucceſs of this attempt cooled Tarquin’s ardent deſire of reigning ; but
                    his ambition made him act a new part. He undertook to regain the favour of his
                    father-in-law by careſſes, ſubmiſſions, and proteſtations of a ſincere regard
                    and affection for him ; inſomuch that the king, who judged of the policy of
                    others from his own, was ſincerely reconciled to him, and tranquillity
                    re-eſtabliſhed in the royal family. But it was not long ere Tarquin, rouſed hy
                    the continual reproaches of his wife, began to renew his intrigues among the
                    ſenators ; of whom he had no ſooner gained a conſider-able party, than he
                    clothed himſelf in the royal robes, and cauſing the faſees to be carried before
                    him by ſome of his domeſtics, croſſed the Roman forum, entered the temple where
                    the ſenate uſed to meet, and ſeated him-</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0338" facs="gri_33125011196389_0344.tif"/>
                <p>ſelf on the throne. Such of the ſenators as were in the faction he found already
                    in their places (for he had given them private notice to be there early) ; and
                    the reſt, being ſummoned to aſſemble in Tarquin’s name, made what haſte they
                    could to the appointed place, thinking that Servius was dead, ſince Tarquin
                    aſſumed the title and functions of king. When they were all aſſembled, Tarquin
                    made a long ſpeech, reviling his father-in-law, and repeating the invectives
                    againſt him, which he had ſo oſten uttered, calling him a {lave, an uſurper, a
                    favourer of the populace, and an enemy to the ſenate and patricians. When he was
                    yet ſpeaking, Servius arrived ; and, raſhly giving way to the motions cſ his
                    courage, without conſidering his ſtrength, drew near the throne, to pull Tarquin
                    down ſrom it. This raiſed a great noiſe in the aſſembly, which drew the people
                    into the temple ; but nobody ventured to part the two rivals. Tarquin therefore,
                    being more ſtrong and vigorous, ſeized the old man by the waiſt, and, hurrying
                    him through the temple, threw him down from the top of the ſteps into the forum.
                    The king, who was grievouſly wounded, raiſed himſelf up with ſome difficulty :
                    but all his friends had abandoned him ; only two or three of the people, touched
                    with compaſſion, lent him their arms to conduct him to his palace.</p>
                <p>As they were leading him on ſo ſlowly, the cruel Tullia appeared in the forum,
                    whither ſhe had haſtened in her chariot on the firſt report of what had paſſed
                    in the ſenate. She found her huſhand on the top of the ſteps of the temple ;
                    and, tranſported with joy, was the firſt who ſaluted him king. The example was
                    immediately followed by the ſenators of Tarquin’s party. Nor was this enough for
                    the unnatural daughter : ſhe took aſide her huſhand, and ſuggeſted to him, that
                    he would never be ſafe ſo long as the uſurper of his crown was alive. Hereupon
                    Tarquin inſtantly diſpatched ſome of his domeſtics to take away the remains of
                    the unfortunate king’s life. The orders ſor the wicked parricide were no ſooner
                    given than Tullia mounted her diariot again, with an air of triumph, to return
                    home. The way to her houſe was through a narrow ſtreet, called <hi rend="italic"
                        > vicus cyρrιus,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">goodJlreet.</hi> There the
                    aſſaſſins had left the king’s body, which was ſtill panting. At this fight, the
                    charioteer, ſtruck with horror, checked his horſes, and made a ſtop : but Tullia
                    forccd him to go on ; and the blood of the father is ſaid to have dyed the
                    wheels of the chariot, and even the clothes of the inhuman daughter, whence the
                    ſtreet was called ever after <hi rend="italic">vicus ſceleratus.</hi></p>
                <p>The new king proved a moſt deſpotic and cruel tyrant ; receiving, in the very
                    beginning of his reign, the ſurname of <hi rend="italic">proud,</hi> on
                    account of his capricious humour and haughty behaviour. All controverſies
                    whatever were decided by himſelf and his friends ; and he ba-»iſhed, fined, and
                    even executed, whom he pleaſed. The cenſus and luſtrum, the diviſion of citizens
                    into claſſes and centuries, were aboliſhed ; and all kinds of aſſemblies, even
                    thoſe ſor amuſement and recreation, were prohibited, both in town and country.
                    Nay, to ſuch a height did Tarquin carry his inſolence and tyranny, that the moſt
                    virtuous of the ſenators went into voluntary baniſhment ; while many of thoſe
                    who remain, ed were cut off on various pretences, that the king might enjoy
                    their eſtates.</p>
                <p>Tarquin could not but be ſenſible of the extreme dan-..</p>
                <p>ger in which he ſtood by lofing the affections of his people in ſuch a manner.
                    He therefore provided a ſuf-ficient number of ſoldiers, by way of guard, to
                    prevent attempts upon his perſon ; and gave his daughter to Octavius Mamilius,
                    one of the moſt conſiderable men among the Latins, in order to ſtrengthen his
                    intereſt by this foreign alliance, in caſe of a revolt among his ſubjects.
                    Mamilius accordingly procured many friends to his father-in-law, but he had like
                    to have loſt them again by his haughty behaviour. He had deſired the Latins to
                    call a national council at Ferentinum, where he would meet them on a day
                    appointed by himſelf. The Latins accordingly met ; but after waiting for ſeveral
                    hours, Tarquin did not appear. On this, one Turnus Hcrdonius, an enterpriſing
                    and eloquent man, who hated Tarquin, and wàs jealous of Mamilius, made a ſpeech,
                    in which he inveighed againſt the haughty behaviour of Tarquin, ſet forth the
                    contempt which he had put upon the Latins, and concluded with deſiring the
                    council to break up and return home without taking any further notice of him.
                    Mamilius, however, prevailed upon them to return the day following; when Tarquin
                    made his appearance, and told the aſſembly that his deſign in calling them
                    together was to claim his right of commanding the Latin armies, which he ſaid
                    was derived from his grandfather, but which he deſired to be confirmed to him by
                    them. Theſe words were ſcarce out of his mouth, when Herdonius, riſing up,
                    entered into a detail of Tarquin’s tyranny and arbitrary behaviour at Rome,
                    which, he ſaid, the Latins would ſoon feel in an equal degree, if they complied
                    with Tarquin’s demand. To this ſpeech the king made no reply at that time, but
                    promiſed to anſwer him next day. In the mean time, however, he bribed the
                    domeſtics of Herdonius to admit among his baggage a large quantity of arms : and
                    then, telling the Latins that Herdonius’s oppoſition proceeded only ſrom
                    Tarquin’s having refuſed him his daughter in marriage, accuſed him of having
                    laid a plot to cut off all the deputies there preſent, and to uſurp a
                    juriſdiction over the Latin cities ; as a proof of which he appealed to the arms
                    hid among the baggage of Herdonius. The accuſed, conſcious of his innocence,
                    deſired that his baggage might be ſearched; which being accordingly done, and
                    the arme found, he was hurried away without being allowed to make any defence,
                    and thrown into a baſon at the head of the ſpring of Ferentinum, where a. hurdle
                    being laid upon him, and ſtones laid upon the hurdle, he was preſſed down into
                    the water and drowned.</p>
                <p>In conſequence of this monſtrous treachery, Tarquin was looked upon by the
                    Latins as their deliverer, and declared general of the Latin armies ; ſoon after
                    which, the Hernici and two tribes of the Volſci entered into an alliance with
                    him on the ſame terms. In order to keep theſe confederates together, Tarquin,
                    with their conſent, erected a temple to Jupiter Latialis on an hill near the
                    ruins of Alba, where he appointed certain feaſts called <hi rend="italic">Feri&lt;t Latina</hi> to be held on the 27th of April, where the
                    ſeveral nations were to ſacriſice together, and on no account to commit any
                    hoſtilities againſt each other during their continuance. The king then proceeded
                    to make war on the reſt of the Volſci who had refuſed to <hi rend="sup">-</hi> enter into an alliance with him. Some deρredatiρnswhich they had committed in
                    the, territo-</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0339" facs="gri_33125011196389_0345.tif"/>
                <p>ries of the Latins ſerved for a pretence to begin the war ; but as Tarquin had
                    no confidence in the Romans, his army was compoſed only of a ſmall body of them
                    who were incorporated among the Latin auxiliaries. However, he defeated the
                    enemy, took one of their cities by ſtorm, and gave the booty to his ſoldiers. He
                    next turned his arms againſt the Sabines, whom he entirely defeated in two
                    engagements, and made the whole nation tributary ; for which exploits he decreed
                    himſelf two triumphs, and on his return to Rome he employed the populace in
                    finiſhing the ſewers and circus which had been begun by his grandfather Tarquin
                    I.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the perſecutions of Tarquin a-gainſt his own ſubjects daily
                    drove ſome of the moſt conſiderable into baniſhment. A great number of
                    patricians took refuge in Gabii, a city of Latium about 13 miles from Rome 5
                    where the inhabitants, touched with compaſſion for their misfortunes, not only
                    received them with kindneſs, but began a war with 'Γarquin on their account. The
                    Gabini ſeem to have been the moſt formidable enemies whom the Romans had
                    hitherto met with ; ſince Tarquin was obliged to raiſe a prodigious bulwark to
                    cover the city on the ſide of Gabii. The war laſted ſeven years ; during which
                    time, by the mutual devaſtations committed by the two armies, a great ſcarcity
                    of proviſions took place in Rome. The people ſoon grew clamorous ; and Tarquin
                    being unable either to quiet them, or to reduce the Gabini, fell upon the
                    following diſhonourable and treacherous expedient. His ſon Sextus Tarquinius
                    pretended to be on very bad terms with his father, and openly inveighed againſt
                    him as a tyrant ; on which he was proclaimed a rebel, and publicly beaten in the
                    forum. This being reported at Gabii, by perſons lent thither on purpoſe, the
                    inhabitants became very deſirous of having Sextus among them ; and accordingly
                    he ſoon went thither, having previouſly obtained a ſolemn promiſe from the
                    inhabitants never to deliver him up to his father. Here he made frequent inroads
                    into the Roman territories, and always came back laden with ſpoil, his father
                    ſending againſt him only ſuch weak parties as muſt infallibly be worſted. By
                    this means he ſoon came to have ſuch a high degree of credit among the Gabini,
                    that he was choſen general of their army, and was as much maſter at Gabii as
                    Tarquin was at Rome. Finding then that his authority was ſufficiently
                    eſtabliſhed, he diſpatched a ſlave to his father for inſtructions ; but the
                    king, unwilling to return an explicit anſwer, only took the meſ-ſenger into the
                    garden, where he ſtruck off the heads of the talleſt poppies. Sextus undeι ſtood
                    that by this hint the king deſired him to put to death the leading men in the
                    city of Gabii, which he immediately put in execution ; and while the city was in
                    confuſion on account of this maſſacre, he opened the gates to his father, who
                    took poſſeſſion of the city with all the pride of a conqueror.·—The inhabitants
                    dreaded every thing from the haughty tyranny of the Roman monarch : however, on
                    tins occaſion he conſulted his policy rather than his revenge ; granted them
                    their lite, liberty, and eſtates, and even entered into a treaty of alliance
                    with them. The articles were written on the hide of an ox, which was ſtill to be
                    ſeen in the time of Auguſtus, in the temple of Jupiter Fidius. After this,
                    however, he made his ſon Sextus king of Gabii ; lending off alſo his two other
                    ſons, Titus and Arunx, the one to build a city at Signia, the other at Circæum,
                    a promontory of the Tyrrhene ſea, and both theſe to keep the Volſci in awe.</p>
                <p>For ſome time Tarquin now enjoyed a profound peace ; the Romans, being
                    accuſtomed to oppreſſion and the yoke of an imperious maſter, malting no
                    oppoſition to his will. During this interval Tarquin met with the celebrated
                    adventure of the Sibyl<note anchored="true" place="margin" type="authorial">See
                        Sibyl. 55</note>; whoſe books were ever afterwards held in high eſtima-tion
                    at Rome, and Tarquin appointed two perſons of diſtinction to take carc of them.
                    Thoſe were called <hi rend="italic">Duumviri :</hi> but their number was
                    afterwards increaſed to 10, when they were called <hi rend="italic">Decemviri ;</hi> and then to 15, when they were termed <hi rend="italic">Quindecemviri.</hi> At this time alſo the written civil law had its origin among the Romans ;
                    all the ſtatutes enacted by the kings being collected into one body ; which,
                    from Papirius the name of the collector, was called the <hi rend="italic">Papiriaa</hi> law. The temple of the Capitol was alſo finiſhed; for which
                    purpoſe the moſt ſkilful architects and workmen were brought from Hetruria, the
                    populace being obliged to ſerve them in the moſt laborious parts.</p>
                <p>We now come to the important revolution which put an end to the regal power at
                    Rome, and introduced a new form of government, to which this city is allowed to
                    owe the greateſt part of her grandeur. Tarquin, as we have already ſeen, had
                    left himſelf no friends among the rich citizens, by reaſon of the oppreſſion
                    under which he made them labour ; and the populace were equally diſaffected on
                    account of their being obliged to labour in his public works. Among the many
                    perſons of diſtinction who had been ſacrificed to the avarice or ſuſpicions of
                    Tarquin, was one M. Junius, who had married the daughter of Tarquin I. This
                    nobleman had a ſon named <hi rend="italic">L. Junius Brutus,</hi> who eſeaped
                    the cruelty of the tyrant by pretending to be an idiot, which part he had ever
                    ſince continued to act. Sooh after the finiſhing of the w0rk3 abovementioned, a
                    violent plague happening to break out at Rome, Tarquin ſent bis ſons Titus and
                    Arunk to conſult the oracle of Delphi ; and the princes took Brutus along with
                    them, to divert themſelves with his pretended folly by the way. Brutus choſe for
                    his offering to the Delphic A-pollo a ſtick of elder ; which occaſioned much
                    laughter. However, he had the precaution to incloſe a rod of gold within the
                    ſtick ; and to this probably it was owing, that the prieſteſs gave the princes
                    the following riddle, that he who ſhould firſt kiſs his mother ſhould ſucceed
                    Tarquin in the government of Rome. This anſwer had been given to their inquiries
                    concerning the ſucceſſion ; upon which the two brothers either drew lots which
                    of them ſhould kiſs their mother at their return, or agreed to do it at once,
                    that both might reign jointly ; but Brutus, imagining the oracle had another
                    meaning, fell down and kiſſed the earth, the common mother of all living. This,
                    in all probability, the prieſteſs had meant ; and had given the anſwer on
                    purpoſe to have another proof of Brutus’s ingenuity, which had already
                    diſcovered itſelf, by his offering the elder ſtick.</p>
                <p>On the return of the princes to Rome, they found, their father engaged in a war
                    with the Rutuli. The treaſury being exhauſted by the ſums which Γarquin had
                    expended in his public works, he had marched to</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0340" facs="gri_33125011196389_0346.tif"/>
                <p>Ardea, the capital of that nation, which lay about 20 miles from P.ome, in hopes
                    of taking it without oppoſition. Contrary to his expectation, however, he λvas
                    obliged to beſiege it in form ; and this conſtrained him to lay a heavy tax upon
                    his ſubjects, which increaſed the number of malcontents, and diſpoſed every
                    thing ſor a revolt. As the ſiege was carried on very ſlowly, the general
                    officers frequently made entertainments for one another in their quarters. One
                    day, when Sextus Tarquinius was entertaining his brothers, the converſation
                    happened to turn upon their wives : every one extolled the good qualities of his
                    own ; but Collatinus beſtowed ſuch extravagant praiſes on his Lucretia, that the
                    diſpute ended in a kind of quarrel. It was then reſolved that they ſhould mount
                    their horſes and ſurpriſe their wives by their unexpected return. The king’s
                    daughters-in-law were employed in feaſting and diverſion, and ſeemed much
                    diſconcerted by the appearance of their huſhands ; but Lucretia, though the
                    night was far advanced, was found, with her maids about her, ſpinning and
                    working in wool. She was not at all diſcompoſed by the company whom her huſhand
                    brought with him, and they were all pleaſed with the reception ſhe gave them. As
                    Lucretia was very beautiful, Sextus Tarquinius conceived a paſſion for her,
                    which reſolving to ſatisfy at all events, he ſoon returned to Collatia in the
                    abſence of Lucretia’s huſhand, and was entertained by her with great civility
                    and reſpect. In the night-time he entered Lucretia’s apartment, and threatened
                    her with immediate death if ſhe did not yield to his deſires. But finding her
                    not to be intimidated with this menace, he told her, that, if ſhe ſtill
                    perſiſted in her refuſal, he would kill one of her male ſlaves, and lay him
                    naked by her when ſhe was dead, and then declare to all the world that he had
                    only revenged the injury of Collatinus. On this the virtuous Lucretia (who, it
                    ſeems, dreaded proſtitution leſs than the infamy attending it) ſubmitted to the
                    deſires of Sextus ; but reſolved not to outlive the violence which had been
                    offered her. She dreſſed herſelf in mourning, and took a poniard under her robe,
                    having previouſly wrote to her huſhand to meet her at her father Lucretius’s
                    houſe, where ſhe refuſed to diſcover the cauſe of her grief except in a full
                    aſſembly of her friends and relations. Here, addreſſing herſelf to her huſhand
                    Collatinus, ſhe acquainted them with the whole affair ; exhorted them to revenge
                    the injury ; and proteſted that ſhe would not outlive the loſs of her honour.
                    Every one preſent gave her a ſolemn promiſe that they would revenge her quarrel
                    ; but while they endeavoured to comfort her, ſhe ſuddenly ſtabbed herſelf to the
                    heart with the dagger which ſhe had concealed under her robe. See Chastity.</p>
                <p>This extravagant action inflamed beyond meaſure the minds of all preſent.
                    Brutus, laying aſide his pretended folly, drew the bloody dagger out of
                    Lucretia’s body ; and, ſhowing it to the aſſembly, ſwore by the blood upon it
                    that he would purſue Tarquin and his family with fire and ſword : nor would he
                    ever ſuffer that or any other family to reign in Rome.. The ſame oath was taken
                    by all the company ; who were ſo much ſurpriſed at the apparent tranſition of
                    Brutus from folly to wiſdom, that they did whatever he deſired them.— By his
                    advice the gates of the city were ſhut, that nobody might go out of it to inform
                    Tarquin of what</p>
                <p>was going forward ; which, as Lucretius had been left governor of the city by
                    Tarquin, was put in execution without difficulty. The corpſe of Lucretia was
                    then expoſed to public view ; and Brutus having made a ſpeech to the people, in
                    which he explained the myſte-ry of his conduct in counterfeiting ſolly for many
                    years paſt, proceeded to tell them that the patricians were come to a reſolution
                    of depoſing the tyrant, and exhorted them to concur in the ſame deſign. The
                    people teſtiſied their approbation, and called out for arms ; but Brutus did not
                    think proper to truſt them with arms till he had firſt obtained a decree of the
                    ſenate in favour of the deſign. This was eaſily procured : the ſenate enacted
                    that Tarquin had forfeited all the prero- , gatives belonging to the regal
                    authority, condemned him and all his poſterity to perpetual baniſhment, and
                    devoted to the gods of hell every Roman who ſhould hereafter, by word or deed,
                    endeavour his reſtoration ; and this decree was unanimouſiy confirmed by the
                    curiæ.</p>
                <p>Tarquin being thus depoſed, the form of government became the next object.
                    Lucretius was for the preſent declared <hi rend="italic">Interrex ;</hi> but
                    Brutus being again conſulted, declared, that though it was by no means proper
                    for the ſtate to be without ſupreme magiſtrates, yet it was equally neceſſary
                    that the power ſhould not be centered in one man, and that it ſhould not be
                    perpetual. For this reaſon he propoſed, that two magiſtrates, called <hi
                        rend="italic"> conſuls,</hi> ſhould be elected annually ; that the ſtate
                    ſhould thenceforth have the name of <hi rend="italic">republic ;</hi> that the
                    enſigns of royalty ſhould be aboliſhed ; and that the only en- ∙ ſigns of
                    conſular dignity ſhould be an ivory chair, a white robe, and 12 lictors for
                    their attendants. However, that he might not utterly aboliſh the name oſ <hi
                        rend="italic"> king,</hi> he propoſed that this title ſhould be given to
                    him who had the ſuperintendency of religious matters, who ſhould thenceforth be
                    called <hi rend="italic">rex.ſacrorum,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">king
                        oſſa-cred things.</hi></p>
                <p>This ſeheme of Brutus being approved of, Brutus and Collatinus were propoſed by
                    Lucretius as the two firſt conſuls, and unanimouſiy accepted by the people, who
                    thought it was impoſſible to find more implacable enemies to the Tarquins. They
                    entered on their office in the year 508 B. C. ; and Tullia, perceiving that now
                    all was loſt, thought proper to leave the city, and retire to her huſhand at
                    Ardea. She was ſuffered to depart without moleſtation, though the populace
                    hooted at her, and curſed her as ſhe went along. Tarquin, in the’mean time,
                    being informed by ſome who had got. out of Rome before the gates were ſhut, that
                    Brutus was raiſing commotions to his prejudice, returned in haſte to the city,
                    attended only by his ſons and a few friends ; but, finding the gates ſhut, and
                    the people irr arms on the walls, lie returned again to the camp : but here
                    again, to his ſurpriſe, he found that the conſuls had taken the opportunity of
                    gaining over the army to their intereſt ; ſo that, being refuſed admittance into
                    the camp alſo, he was forced to fly for refuge, at the age of 76, with his wiſe
                    and three ſons, to Gabii, where Sextus had been made king. Here he continued for
                    ſome time : but not rinding the Latins very forward to revenge his cauſe, he
                    retired into Hetruria where, being the country of his mother’s family, he hoped
                    to find more friends, and a readier aſſiſtance for attempting the recovery of
                    his throne.</p>

                <p>The Romans now congratulated themſelves on their happy deliverance ſrom tyranny.
                    However, as Tarquin had by his policy procured himſelf many friends abroad,
                    theſe now became enemies to the Roman name; and, by the defection of their
                    allies, the Roman dominions were left in much the ſame ſtate as they had been in
                    the time of Romulus. The territory of Rome had always been confined to a very
                    narrow’ compaſs. Though almoſt conſtantly victorious in war for 243 years, they
                    had not yet gained land enough to ſupply their city with proviſions. The main
                    ſtrength of the ſtate lay in the number of the citizens of Rome ; which the
                    cuſtom of tranſplanting the inhabitants of the conquered cities thither had ſo
                    prodigiouſly increaſed, that it put the Romans in a condition of uſurping the
                    authority over other nations, the moſt inconſiderable of which had an extent of
                    territory far exceeding theirs. By frequent depredations and incurſions they ſo
                    haraſſed the petty ſtates of Latium and Hetruria, that many of them were
                    conſtrained to enter into treaties with Rome, by which they obliged themſelves
                    to furniſh her with auxiliaries whenever ſhe ſhould be pleaſed to invade and
                    pillage the lands of her other neighbours. Submiſſions of this kind the Romans
                    called <hi rend="italic">making alliances</hi> with them, and theſe uſeful
                    alliances ſupplied the want of a larger territory ; but now, upon the change of
                    her government, all the allies of Rome forſeok her at once, and either ſtood
                    neuter, or eſpouſed the cauſe of the baniſhed king; ſo that ſhe was now obliged
                    to maintain her liberties as ſhe beſt might.</p>
                <p>The new conſuls in the mean time took the moſt effectual methods they could for
                    ſecuring the liberties of the republic. The army which had been employed in the
                    ſiege of Ardea marched home under the conduct of Herminius and Horatius, who
                    concluded a truce with the Ardeates for 15 years. The conſuls then again
                    aſtembled the people by centuries, and had the 'decree of Tarquin’s baniſhment
                    confirmed ; a <hi rend="italic">rex ſacrorum</hi> was elected to preſide at
                    the ſacrifices, and many of the laws of Servius Tullius were revived, to the
                    great joy of the people, who were thus reſtored to their ancient right of voting
                    in all important affairs. Tarquin, however, reſolved not to part with his
                    kingdom on ſuch eaſy terms. Having wandered ſrom city to city in order to move
                    compaſſion, he at length made Tarquinii the ſeat of his reſidence ; where he
                    engaged the inhabitants to ſend an embaſſy to Rome, with a modeſt, ſubmiſſive
                    letter from himſelf, directed to the</p>
                <p>Roman people. The ambaſſadors repreſented in ſuch ſtrong terms to the ſenate how
                    reaſonable it was to let the king be heard before he w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> as condemned, and the danger which threatened the ſtate from the neighbouring
                    powers if that common juſtice were refuſed, that the conſiſts inclined to bring
                    theſe agents before the people, and to leave the deciſion thereof to the curiae
                    ; but Valerius, who had been very active in the revolution, ſtrenuouſly oppoſed
                    this, and by his influence in the ſenate got it prevented. As that illuſtrious
                    body had been greatly thinned by the murders committed by Tarquin, new members
                    were elected from among the knights, and the ancient number of 300 again
                    completed. The old ſenators had been called <hi rend="italic">patres</hi> or “
                    fathers ;” and as the names of the new oneswere now written on the ſame roll,
                    the whole body received the name of <hi rend="italic">patres conſcriptt.</hi></p>
                <p>The old king was not to be foiled by a ſingle at</p>
                <p>tempt. He prevailed on the inhabitants of Tarquinii to ſend a ſecond embaſſy to
                    Rome, under pretence of demanding the eſtates of the exiles, but with private
                    inſtructions to get the conſuls aſſaſſinated. The reſtoration of the eſtates of
                    the exiles was oppoſed by Brutus, but Collatinus was for complying with it ;
                    whereupon Brutus accuſed his colleague of treachery, and of a deſign to bring
                    back the tyrant. The matter was then referred to the people, where it was
                    carried by one vote in favour of the Tarquins. But whilſt the people were
                    employed in loading carriages with the effects of the exiles, and in felling
                    what could not be carried off, the ambaſſadors found means to draw ſome of the
                    neareſt relations of the conſuls into a plot with them. Theſe were three young
                    noblemen of the Aquilian family (the ſons of Collatinus’s ſiſter), and two of
                    the Vitëllii (whoſe ſiſter Brutus had married) ; and theſe laſt engaged Titus
                    and Tiberius, the two ſons of Brutus, in the ſame conſpiracy. They all bound
                    themſelves by ſolemn oaths, with the dreadful ceremony of drinking the blood of
                    a murdered man and touching his entrails. They met at the houſe of the Aquilii,
                    where they wrote letters to Tarquin and gave them to the ambaf~ ſadors. But
                    though they uſed all imaginable precaution, their proceedings were overheard by
                    one Vindi-cius a ſlave, who immediately communicated the whole to Valerius ;
                    upon which all the criminals were apprehended. Brutus ſtood judge over his own
                    ſons ; and, notwithſtanding the interceſſion of the whole aſſembly, and the
                    tears and lamentations of his children, commanded them to be beheaded-; nor
                    would he depart till he ſaw the execution of the ſentence. Having performed this
                    piece of heroic barbarity, he quitted the tribunal, and left Collatinus to
                    perform the reſt. Collatinus, however, being inclined to ſpare his nephews,
                    allowed them a day to clear themſelves ; and cauſed Vindicius, the only witneſs
                    againſt them, to be delivered up to his maſters. This rouſed the indignation of
                    the people in general, eſpecially of Valerius, who had promiſed to protect the
                    witneſs, and therefore he refuſed to deliver him up to the lictors. The
                    multitude called aloud for Brutus to return ; which when he had done, he told
                    them that he had executed his two ſons in conſequence of his own paternal
                    authority over them, but that it belonged to the people to determine the fate of
                    the reſt. Accordingly, by a decree of the curiæ, all the delinquents ſuffered as
                    traitors except the ambaſſadors, who were ſpared out of reſpect to their
                    character. The ſlave Vindicius had his liberty granted</p>
                <p>him; and was preſented with 25,00? aies of braſs, in value about L.,8o : 14 : 7
                    of our money. The decree for reſtoring the eſtates of the exiled Tarquins was
                    annulled, their palaces were deſtroyed, and their lands divided among the
                    indigent people. The public only 1 etained a piece of ground, near the Campus
                    Martius? which the king had uſurped. This they conſecrated: to Mars, and it
                    afterwards became a common field where the Roman youth exerciſed themſelves in
                    running and wreſtling. But after this conſecration, the ſuperſtitious Romans
                    ſcrupled to uſe the corn which they found there ready reaped to their hands : ſo
                    that&gt;, with ſome trees, it was thrown into the Tiber ; and. the water
                    being low, it flopped in the middle of the river, and began to form a fine

                <p>Γuch a terror into the Romans, that ſcarce any perſon durſt oppoſe him; and
                    therefore, as he hated Collatinus, he openly accuſed him before the people, and
                    without ceremony depoſed him from the Conſulſhip, baniſhing him at the ſame time
                    from Rome. The multitude ac-quieſeed in every thing he ſaid, and refuſed to hear
                    Collatinus ſpeak in his own defence ; ſo that the conſul was on the point of
                    being driven out with ignominy and diſgrace, when Lucretius interpoſed, and
                    prevailed upon Brutus to allow his colleague quietly to reſign the faſees, and
                    retire of his own accord from the city. Brutus then, to remove all ſuſpicions of
                    perſortal enmity, procured him a preſent of 20 talents out of the public
                    treaſury, to which he added five of his own. Collatinus then retired to
                    Lavinium, where he lived in peace, and at laſt died of old age.</p>
                <p>After the abdication of Collatinus, Valerius was choſen in his room; and as his
                    temper agreed much better ιvith Brutus than that of Collatinus, the two conſuls
                    lived in great harmony. Nothing,however, could make the dethroned king forego
                    the hope of recovering his kingdom by force. He firſt engaged the Volſci and
                    Tar-quinienſes to join their forces in order to ſupport his rights. The conſuls
                    marched out without delay to meet them. Brutus commanded the horſe and Valerius
                    the foot, drawn up in a ſquare battalion. The two armies being in fight of each
                    other, Brutus advanced with his cavalry, at the ſame time that A unx, one of
                    Tarquin’s ſons, was coming forward with the enemy’s horſe, the king himſelf
                    following with the legions. Arunx no ſooner diſcovered Brutus, than he made
                    towards him with all the ſury of an enraged enemy. Brutus advanced towards him
                    with no leſs ſpeed ; and as both were actuated only by motives of hatred,
                    without thoughts of ſelſepreſervation, both of them were pierced through with
                    their lances. The death of the two generals ſerved as a prelude to the battle,
                    which continued with the utmoſt ſury till night, when it could not be known
                    which ſide had got the victory, or which had</p>
                <p>loſt the greateſt number of men. A report was ſpread, however, that a voice had
                    been heard out of a neighbouring wood, declaring the Romans conquerors ; and
                    this, probably a ſtratagem of Valerius, operated ſo powerfully on the
                    ſuperſtitious minds of the Volſci, that they left their camp in confuſion, and
                    returned to their own country. It is ſaid that Valerius, having cauſed the dead
                    to be numbered, found that the Volſci had loſt 11,300 men, and the Romans only
                    one ſhort of that number.</p>
                <p>Valerius being left without a colleague in the con-ſulſhip, and having ſor ſome
                    reaſons delayed to chooſe one, began to be ſuſpected by the people of aſpiring
                    at the ſovereignty ; and theſe ſuſpicions were in ſome meaſure countenanced by
                    his building a fine houſe on the ſteep part of the hill Palatinus, which
                    overlooked the forum, and was by them conſidered as a citadel. But of this
                    Valerius was no ſooner informed, than he cauſed this houſe to be pulled down,
                    and immediately called an aſſembly of the people for the election of a conſul,
                    in which he left them entirely free. They choſe Lucretius ; and, being aſhamed
                    of having ſuſpected Valerius, they complimented him with a large ground-plot in
                    an agreeable place, where they built him a houſe. The new conſul died a few days
                    after his promotion, ſo that Valerius was once more left ſole go</p>
                <p>vernor. In the interval betwixt the death of Lucretius and the choice of another
                    conſul, Valerius gave the people ſo many ſtriking proofs of his attachment to
                    their intereſt, that they beſtowed upon him the ſur-name of <hi rend="italic">Poplicola</hi> or “ popular j” nor was he ever call&lt; ed by another
                    name afterwards.</p>
                <p>When Poplſeola’s year of conſulſhip expired, the Romans thought fit, in
                    conſequence of the critical ſituation of affairs, to elect him a ſecond time,
                    and joined with him T. Lucretius, the brother of the famous Lucretia. They began
                    with reſtoring the cenfus and luſtrum ; and found the number of Roman citizens,
                    at or above the age of puberty, to amount to 130,000. As they apprehended an
                    attack from the Latins on account of Tarquin, they were at great pains to
                    fortify Sinquirinum or Siugliuria, an important poſt on that ſide. Contrary to
                    their expectations, however, the Latins remained quiet ; but an haughty embaſſy
                    was received from Porſena king of Cluſium in Hetruria, commanding them either to
                    take back the Tarquins to Rome, or to reſtore them their eſtates. To the firſt
                    of theſe demands the conſuls returned an abſolute refuſal : and, as to the
                    ſecond, they anſwered, that it was impracticable ; a part of thoſe eſtates
                    having been conſecrated to Mars, and the reſt divided among indigent people,
                    from whom they could not be recovered. The imminent danger which now threatened
                    the city, procured Valerius the honour of a third conſulſhip ; and with him was
                    joined Horatius Pulvilius, who had en</p>
                <p>joyed the dignity for a few months before in the inter’ val betwixt the death of
                    Lucretius and the expiration of the firſt conſulate.</p>
                <p>While the Romans were making the moſt vigorous preparations for defence,
                    Porſena, attended by his ſon Arunx and the exiles, marched towards the city at
                    the head of a formidable army, which was quickly joined by a conſiderable body
                    of Latins under Mamilius, the ſon-in law of Tarquin. The conſuls and the ſenate
                    took all imaginable care to ſupply the common people with proviſions, leſt
                    famine ſhould induce them to open the gates to Tarquin ; and they deſired the
                    country people to lodge their effects in the fort Janiculum, which overlooked
                    the city, and which was the only <hi rend="italic">for-</hi> tified place
                    poſſeſſed by the Romans on that ſide the Tiber. Porſena, however, ſoon drove the
                    Romans out of this fort ; upon which the conſuls made all their troops paſs the
                    river, and drew them up in order of battle to defend the bridge, while Porſena
                    advanced to engage them. The victory was a long time doubtful j but at laſt the
                    Romans fled. Horatius Codes, nephew to the conſul, with Sp. Lartius and T.
                    Herminius, who had commanded the right-wing, poſted themſelves at the entrance
                    of the bridge, and for a long time bravely defended it: but at laſt, the
                    defenſive arms of Lartius and Herminius being broken, they retired; and then
                    Horatius deſiring them to adviſe the conſuls from him to cut the bridge at the
                    other end, he for a while ſuſtained the attack of the enemy alone. At laſt,
                    being wounded in the thigh, and the ſignal given that the bridge was almoſt
                    broken down, he leaped into the river, and ſwam acroſs it through a ſhower of
                    darts. The Romans, in token of gratitude for this eminent ſervice, erected a
                    ſtatue to him in the temple of Vulcan, gave him as much land as he himſelf with
                    one yoke of oxen could plough in one day ; and each of the inha-</p>

                <p>bitants, to the number of 300,003, gave him the value of as much food as each
                    conſumed in a day. But notwithſtanding all this, as he had loſt one eye, and
                    from his wounds continued lame throughout the remainder of his life, theſe
                    defects prevented his ever being raiſed to the conſulate, or invtſted with any
                    military command.</p>
                <p>The city was not yet fully inveſted ; but as it was very difficult to find
                    proviſions for ſuch a multitude, the inhabitants ſoon began to be in want.
                    Porſena being informed of their difficulties, told them that he would ſupply
                    them with proviſions if they would take back their old maſters ; but to this
                    they replied, that hunger was a leſs evil than ſlavery and oppreſſion. Tire
                    conſtancy of the Romans, however, was on the point of failing, when a young
                    patrician, named <hi rend="italic">Muûus Cordas,</hi> with the conſent of the
                    ſenate and conſuls, undertook to aſſaſſinate Porſena. He got acceſs to the
                    Hetrurian camp, diſguiſed like a peaſant, and made his way to the king’s tent.
                    It happened to be the day on which the troops were all reviewed and paid ; and
                    Por-ſena’s ſecretary, magnificently dreſſed, was ſitting on the ſame tribunal
                    with the king. Mutius, miſtaking him for Porſena, inſtantly leaped upon the
                    tribunal and killed him. He then attempted to make his eſcape ; but being ſeized
                    and brought back, he owned his deſign ; and with a countenance expreſſive of
                    deſperate rage and diſappointment, thruſt his hand which had miſſed the blow
                    into a pan of burning coals which ſtood by, and there held it for a conſiderable
                    time. On this, Porſena, changing his reſentment into admiration, granted him his
                    life and liberty, and even reſtored him the dagger with which he intended to
                    have ſtabbed himſelf. Mutius took it with his left hand, having loſt the uſe of
                    the other ; and from this time had the name of <hi rend="italic">Scαvc&gt;la,</hi> or “ left-handed.” He then, in order to induce
                    Porſena to break up the ſiege, invented a ſtory that 300 young Romans, all of
                    them as reſolute as himſelf, had ſworn to take aw <hi rend="sup">,</hi> ay the
                    life of the king of Hetruria, or to periſh in the attempt. This had the deſired
                    effect.; Porſena ſent deputies to Rome, whoſe only demands were, that the Romans
                    ſhould reſtore the eſtates of the Tarquins, or give them an equivalent, and give
                    back the ſeven ſmall towns which had been formerly taken from the Veientes. The
                    latter of theſe demands was cheerfully complied with ; but the former was ſtill
                    refuſed, until Porſena ſhould hear the ſtrong reaſons they had to urge againſt
                    it. A truce being agreed on, deputies were ſent to the Hetrurian camp to plead
                    the Roman cauſe againſt the Tarquins, and with tlrem ten young men, and as many
                    virgins, by way of hoſtages for performing the other article.</p>
                <p>The reception which Porſena gave the deputies raiſed the jealouſy of the
                    Tarquins ; who ſtill retaining their ancient pride, refuſed to admit Porſena for
                    a judge between them and the Romans. But the king, without any regard to their
                    oppoſition, reſolved to ſatisfy himſelf, by an exact inquiry, whether the
                    protection he had given the Tarquins was juſt. But while the cauſe was ready to
                    be opened before the Roman deputies, news were brought that the young women whom
                    the Romans had ſent as hoſtages had ventured to ſwim acroſs the Tiber, and were
                    returned to Rome. They had gone to bathe in the river, and Clælia happening to
                    tuvn her eyes towards her native city, that</p>
                <p>fight raiſed in her a deſire of returning to it. She therefore ventured to ſwim
                    acroſs the river ; and having encouraged her companions to follow her, they all
                    got ſafe to the oppoſite ſhore, and returned to their ſathera houſes. The return
                    of the hoſtages gave the conſul Poplicola great uneaſineſs ; he w <hi rend="sup"
                        > τ</hi> as afraid left this raſh action might be imputed to want of
                    fidelity in the Romans. To remove therefore all ſuſpicions, he ſent a deputation
                    to the Hetrurian camp, aſſuring the king that Rome had no ſhare in the fooliſh
                    attempt of the young women ; and promiſing to ſend them immediately back to the
                    camp from whence they had fled. Porſena was eaſily appeaſed ; but the news of
                    the ſpeedy return of the hoſtages being known in the camp, the Tarquins, without
                    any regard to the truce, or reſpect to the king their protector, lay in ambuſh
                    on the road to ſurpriſe them. Poplicola having put himſelf at the head of the
                    Roman troops who eſcorted them, ſuſtained the attack of the Tarquins, though
                    ſudden and unexpected, till his daughter Valeria rode full ſpeed to the
                    Hetrurian camp, and gave notice of the danger her father and companions were in
                    ; and then Arunx, the king’s ſon, flying with a great body of cavalry to their
                    relief, put the ag-greſſors to the rout.</p>
                <p>This notorious piece of treachery in the Tarquins gave Porſena ſtrong fuſpicions
                    of the badneſs of their cauſe. He therefore aſſembled the chief commanders of
                    the Hetrurians ; and having heard in their preſence the complaints of the
                    Romans, and the juſtiſication of their proceedings againſt the Tarquins, he w <hi rend="sup">ι</hi> as ſo ſtruck with horror at the recital of the
                    crimes the Tarquins were charged with, that he immediately ordered them to leave
                    his camp ; declaring, that he renounced his alliance with them, and would no
                    longer continue the hoſ-pitality he had ſhown them. He then commanded the ten
                    young virgins to be brought before him, and inquired who was the firſt author
                    and chief manager of the enterpriſe. They all kept ſilence, till Clælia
                    her-ſelf, with an air of intrepidity, conſeſſed, that ſhe alone was guilty, and
                    that ſhe had encouraged the others by her advice. Upon this the king, extolling
                    her reſolution above the bravery of Horatius and the intrepidity of Mutius, made
                    her a preſent of a fine horſe, with ſumptuous furniture. After this he concluded
                    a peace with the Romans, and reſtored to them all their hoſtages ; declaring,
                    that their bare word, was to him a ſuffi-ciεnt ſecurity for the performance of
                    the articles.</p>
                <p>And now Porſena being about to return to Cluſium, gave, before his departure, a
                    further teſtimony of his reſpect and friendſhip for the Romans. He knew that
                    Rome was greatly diſtreſſed for want of proviſions; but being afraid to offend
                    the inhabitants by relieving them in a direct manner, he ordered his ſoldiersrto
                    leave behind them their tents and proviſions, and to carry nothing with them but
                    their arms. As his camp abounded with all ſorts of proviſions, Rome was hereby
                    much ∙ relieved in her wants. The moveables and corn of the Hetrurians were ſold
                    by auction to private perſons <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and on this occaſion
                    the Romans took up the cuſtom of making a proclamation by an herald, whenever
                    any effects belonging to the public were to be ſold, in the ſollowirig words, <hi rend="italic">Theſe are Porſena's goods.</hi> The deſign of this was
                    to preſerve the memory of that prince’s-kindneſs. The ſenate, not ſatisfied with
                    this, erected a ſtatue of the king «ear the εomitium, and ſent aα</p>

                <p>embaſſy to him with a preſent of a throne adorned with ivory, a ſceptre, a crown
                    of gold, and a triumphal robe.</p>
                <p>Thus the Romans eſeaped the greateſt danger they had hitherto been in. However,
                    they did not yet enjoy tranquillity. The Sabines revolted, and continued the war
                    for ſome time with great obſtinacy : but being defeated in ſeveral engagements,
                    they were at laſt obliged to ſubmit ; and ſcarce was this war ended, when
                    another began with the Latins, who now declared ſor king Tarquin. Before they
                    jjegan this war, however, an embaſſy was ſent to Rome, the purport of which was,
                    that the Romans ſhould raiſe the ſiege of Fidenæ which had revolted, and receive
                    the Tarquins ; who, on their part, ſhould grant a general amneſty. The
                    ambaſſadors were to allow the Romans a whole year to conſider on theſe overtures
                    ; and to threaten them with a war in caſe they reſuſed to comply with them. The
                    chief view of Tarquin and his partiſans in promoting this embaſſy was, to lay
                    hold of that opportunity to raiſe a ſedition in the city. To the ambaſſadors,
                    therefore, of the Latins, he joined ſome of his own emiſſaries, who, on their
                    arrival in the city, found two ſorts of people diſpoſed to enter into their
                    meaſures; to wit, the ∩aves, and the meaner citizens.</p>
                <p>The ſlaves had formed a conſpiracy the year before to ſeize the Capitol, and ſet
                    fire to the city in ſeveral quarters at the ſame time. But the plot being
                    diſcovered, thoſe who were concerned in it had been all crucified, and this
                    execution had highly provoked the whole body of ſlaves. As to the meaner
                    citizens, who were for the moſt part overwhelmed with debt, and cruelly uſed by
                    their creditors, they were well appri-ſed that there could happen no change in
                    the government but to their advantage. Theſe were the conſpirators pitched upon,
                    and to them were given the following parts to act : the citizens were to make
                    themſelves maſters of the ramparts and gates of the city, at an appointed hour
                    of the night ; and then to raiſe a great ſhout as a ſignal to the ſlaves, who
                    had engaged to maſſacre their maſters at the ſame inſtant : the gates of the
                    city were then to be opened to the Tarquins, who were to enter Rome while it was
                    yet reeking with the blood of the ſenators. The conſpiracy was ripe for
                    execution, when Tarquin’s principal agents, Publius and Marcus, both of his own
                    name and family, being terrified with frightful dreams, had not courage enough
                    to proceed in their deſign till they had conſulted a diviner. However, they did
                    not diſcover to him the conſpiracy ; but only aſhed him in general terms, what
                    ſucceſs they might expect in a project they had formed ? The ſoothſayer, without
                    the leaſt heſitation, returned the following anſwer ; <hi rend="italic">Dour
                        project will end in your ruin ; dſburden your (elves of ſo heavy a load.</hi> Hereupon the Tarquins, fearing leſt ſome of the other conſpirators ſhould
                    be beforehand with them in informing, went immediately to S. Sulpitius, the only
                    conſul then at Rome, and diſcovered the whole matter to him. Tſte conſul greatly
                    commended them, and detained them in his houſe, till, by private inquiries, he
                    was aſſured of the truth of their depoſitions. Then he aſſembled the ſenate, and
                    gave the Latin ambaſſadors their audience of leave, with an anſwer to their
                    propofols; which was, that the Romans would neither receive the Tarquins, nor
                    raiſe the ſiege of Fidenæ, being all</p>
                <p>to a man ready to ſacriſice their lives in defence of their liberties, and
                    willing to undergo any dangers rather than ſubmit to the government of a tyrant.</p>
                <p>The ambaſſadors being diſmiſſed with this anſwer, and conducted out of the city,
                    Sulpitius laid open to the fathers the dreadful conſpiracy. It ſtruck them with
                    horror : but they were all at a loſs in what manner they ſhould apprehend and
                    puniſh the guilty; ſince, by the law of Poplicola, there was an appeal to the
                    people in all capital caſes ; and the two witneſſes, who were ſtrangers, might
                    be excepted againſt by Roman citizens. In this perplexity they left the whole
                    conduct of this critical affair to Sulpitius; who took a method which he thought
                    would equally ſerve to prove the guilt and puniſh the guilty. He engaged the two
                    informers to aſſemble the conſpirators, and to appoint a rendezvous at midnight
                    in the forum, as if they deſigned to take the laſt meaſures for the execution of
                    the enterpriſe. In the mean time he uſed all proper means to ſecure the city,
                    and ordered the Roman knights to hold themſelves ready, in the houſes adjoining
                    to the forum, to execute the orders they ſhould receive. The conſpirators met at
                    the time and place appointed by the two Tarquins ; and the knights, upon a
                    ſignal agreed on beforehand, inveſted the forum, and blocked up all the avenues
                    to it ſo cloſely, that it was impoſſiblè for any of the conſpirators to make
                    their eſcape. ’ As ſoon as it was light, the two conſuls appeared with a ſtrong
                    guard on the tribunal ; for Sulpitius had ſent to his colleague Manius, who was
                    beſieging Fidenæ, deſiring him to haften to the city with a choſen body of
                    troops. The people were convened by curiæ, and acquainted with the conſpiracy
                    which' had been formed againſt the common liberty. The accuſed were allowed to
                    make their defence, if they had any thing to offer againſt the evidence; but not
                    one of them denying the fact, the conſuls repaired to the ſenate, where ſentence
                    of death was pronounced againſt the conſpirators, in caſe the people approved
                    it.</p>
                <p>This decree of the ſenate being read to and approved by the aſſembly, the people
                    were ordered to retire, and the conſpirators were delivered up to the ſoldiers,
                    who put them all to the ſword. The peace of Rome was thought ſufficiently
                    ſecured by this ſtroke of ſeverity ; and therefore, though all the conſpirators
                    were not puniſhed with death, it was judged proper not to make any further
                    inquiries. The two informers were rewarded with all the privileges of Roman
                    citizens, ιoo,boo aſes, and 20 acres of land. Three feſtival-days were appointed
                    for expiations, ſacrifices, and public games, by way of thankſgiving to the
                    gods. But rhe general joy was diſturbed by a melancholy accident : as the people
                    were conducting Manius Tullius the conſul from the circus to his houſe, he fell
                    from his chariot, and died three days after.</p>
                <p>The city of Fidenæ was not yet reduced : it held out during the following
                    conſulſhip of T. Æbutius and P. Veturius ; but was taken the next year by T.
                    Lartius, who, together with Q. Clælius, was raiſed to the conſular dignity. The
                    Latins, enraged at the loſs of this town, began to complain of their leading men
                    ; which opportunity Tarquin and Mamilius improved fo far, as to make all the
                    Latin cities, 24 in number, enter into an alliance againſt Rome, and t6' bind
                    themſelves by oath never to violate their engagements. The La-.</p>

                <p>tins made vaſt preparations, as did likewiſe the Romans; but the latter could
                    procure no aſſiſtance from their neighbours. As the Latin nation was much
                    ſuperior to them in ſtrength, they ſent deputies to ſolicit ſuc-cours from the
                    ſeveral ſtates with which they were ſurrounded : but their negociations proved
                    every where unſucceſsful; and, what was worſe than all, the republic had
                    rebellious ſons in her own boſom, who refuſed to lend their aid in defence of
                    their country. The poorer fort of people, and the debtors, refuſed to take the
                    military oaths, or to ſerve ; alleging their poverty, and the fruitleſs hazards
                    they ran in fighting for the defence of a city, where they were oppreſſed and
                    enilaved by their creditors. This ſpirit of mutiny ſpread among the inferior
                    claſſes, moſt of them refuſing to liſt themſelves, unleſs their debts were all
                    remitted by a decree of the ſenate ; nay, they began to talk of leaving the
                    city, and ſettling elſewhere.</p>
                <p>The ſenate, apprehending a general inſurrection, aſſembled to deliberate on the
                    means of quieting thoſe domeſtic troubles. Some were for a free remiſſion of all
                    debts, as the ſafeſt expedient at that juncture; others urged the dangerous
                    conſequences of ſuch a condeſcen-ſion, adviſing them to liſt ſuch only as were
                    willing to ſerve, not doubting but thoſe who refuſed their aſſiſtance would
                    offer it of their own accord when it was no longer deſired. Several other
                    expedients were propoſed : but at length this prevailed ; to wit, that all
                    actions for debts ſhould be ſuſpended till the conclulion of the war with the
                    Latins. But this the indigent debtors thought only a ſuſpenſion of their miſery
                    ; and therefore it had not the intended effect on the minds of the unruly
                    multitude. The ſenate might indeed have proſecuted the ringleaders of the
                    ſedition ; but the law of Poplicola, called the <hi rend="italic">Palerian law,</hi> which allowed appeals to the aſſembly of the people, was a protection ſor
                    the ſeditious, who were ſure of being acquitted by the accomplices of their
                    rebellion. The ſenate, therefore, to elude the effect of a privilege that put
                    ſuch a reſtraint upon their power, reſolved to create one ſupreme magiſtrate,
                    who, with the title of <hi rend="italic">di8ator,</hi> ſhould have an abſolute
                    power for a time : but as this could not be done without ſtriking at the law of
                    Poplicola, and transferring the power of the people in criminal caſes to a
                    magiſtrate ſuperior to all laws, it was, neceſſary to uſe artifice, in order to
                    obtain the conſent of the curiæ. They therefore repreſented to them in a public
                    aſſembly, that, in ſo difficult a conjuncture, when they had their domeſtic
                    quarrels to decide, and at the ſame time a powerful enemy to repulſe, it would
                    be expedient to put the commonwealth under a lingle governor, who, ſuperior to
                    the conſuls themſelves, ſhould be the arbiter of the laws, and as it were the
                    father of his country ; that his power ſhould have no limits : but, however,
                    leſt he ſhould abuſe it, they ought not to truſt him with it above ſix months.</p>
                <p>The people, not foreſeeing the conſequences of this change, agreed to it ; but
                    the greateſt difficulty was to find a man duly qualified in all reſpects for ſo
                    great a truſt. T. Lartius, one of the conſuls, ſeemed to be of all men the moſt
                    unexceptionable ; but the ſenate, fearing to offend his colleague by an
                    invidious preference, gave the conſuls the power of chooſing a dictator, and
                    obliged them to name one of themſelves, not doubting but Clœlius would yield to
                    the ſuperior talents of his colleague ; nor were they diſappointed in their
                    expectations. But Lartius, with the ſame readi-neſs, named Cloelius ; and the
                    only contcſt was, which of the two ſhould raiſe the other to the ſupreme
                    authority. Each perſiſted obſtinately in remitting the dignity to his colleague,
                    till Cloelius, ſtarting up on a hidden, abdicated the conſulſhip, and, after the
                    manner of an interrex, proclaimed Titus Lartius dictator, who thereupon was
                    obliged to take upon him the government of the republic.</p>
                <p>Lartius indeed took as much ſtate upon him, after he had entered upon his
                    office, as he had ſhown mo-deſty in refuſing it. He began by creating, without
                    the participation either of the ſenate or people, a general of the Roman horſe ;
                    an office which laſted only during the dictatorſhip, and which all ſubſequent
                    dictators revived immediately after their election. Sp. Caſſius, formerly
                    conſul, and honoured with a triumph, was the perſon he advanced to this ſecond
                    ſtation in the republic. Lartius, having by this means ſecured the Roman
                    knights, reſolved, in the next place, to make the people reſpect and fear him.
                    With this view he never appeared in public, without being attended by 24
                    lictors, to whoſe faſees he again added the axes which Poplicola had cauſed to
                    be taken from them. The novelty of this fight was alone ſufficient to awe the
                    ſeditious, and, without executions, to ſpread con-ſternation throughout Rome.
                    The murmurs of the inferior claſſes being by this means ſilenced, the dictator
                    commanded a cenſus to be taken, according to the in-ſtitution of King Servius.
                    Every one, without exception, brought in his name, age, the particulars of his
                    eſtate, &amp;c. and there appeared to be in Rome x 50,700 men who were paſt
                    the age of puberty. Out of theſe the dictator formed four armies : the firſt he
                    commanded himſelf; the ſecond he gave to Clœlius his late colleague; the third
                    to Sp. Caſſius his general of the horſe; and the fourth he left in Rome, under
                    the command of his brother Sp. Lartius, who was to guard the city. The Latins
                    not being ſo forward in their preparations as was expected, all their
                    hoſtilities againſt Rome this campaign amounted to no more than the ſending a
                    detachment into the Roman territory to lay it waſte. The dictator gained ſome
                    advantage over that party ; and the great humanity with which he treated the
                    priſoners and woμnded, diſpoſed the Latins to liſten the more readily to the
                    overtures which he at the ſame time made them for a ſuſpenſion of hoſtilities.
                    At length a truce was agreed on for a year ; and then Lartius, feeing the
                    republic reſtored to its former tranquillity, reſigned the dictatorſhip, though
                    the time appointed for its duration was not yet expired.</p>
                <p>The following conſulſhip of Sempronius Atratinus and Mimιtius Angurinus,
                    produced nothing memorable. But the next year the truce expired, when Aulus
                    Poſthumius and T. Virginius took poſſeſſion of the conſulſhip. Both Romans and
                    Latins were buſied in making the neceſſary preparations for war. The nobility of
                    Latium, who were ſor the moſt part in the intereſt of the Tarquins, having found
                    means to exclude the citizens from the Latin diets, carried all before them in
                    thoſe aſſemblies : whereupon many of the citizens removed with their families to
                    Rome, where they were well received. The Latins being bent, upon war, the
                    ſenate, notwithſtanding the perfect har-</p>

                <p>mony that reigned between them and the people, thought it expedient to create a
                    dictator. The two conſuls were therefore impαwersd to name one of themſelves to
                    that dignity ; whereupon Virginius readily yielded it to his colleague
                    Poſthumius, as the more able commander. The new dictator, having created Æbutius
                    Elva his general of the horſe, and divided his army into four bodies, left one
                    ol them, under the command of Sempronius, to guard the city ; and with the other
                    three, commanded by himſelf, Virginius, and Æbutius, marched out againſt the
                    Latins, who, with an army of 40,000 foot and 30c0 horſe, under the command of
                    f&gt;extus Tarquinius, Titus Tarquinius, and Mamilius, had already made
                    themſe lves maſters of Corbin, a ſtrong-hold belonging to the republic, and put
                    the garriſcn to the ſword. Poſthumius encamped in the night on a ſteep hill near
                    the lake Rεgillus, and Virginius on another hill over-againſt him. Æbutius was
                    ordered to march ſilently in the night, with the cavalry and light-armed
                    infantry, to take poiſeſſion of a third hill upon the road, by which proviſions
                    muſt be brought to the Latins.</p>
                <p>Before Æbutius had fortified his new camp, he was vigorouſly attacked by Lucius
                    Tarquinius, whom he rcpulſed three times with great loſs, the dictator having
                    ſent him a timely reinforcement. After this, Æ-butius intercepted two couriers
                    ſent by the Volſci to the Latin generals, and, by letters found upon them,
                    diſcovered, that a conſiderable army of the Volſci and Hernici were to join the
                    Latin forces in three days. Upon this intelligence, Poſthumius drew his three
                    bodies of troops together, which amounted in all to no more than 24,000 toot and
                    ιcoo horſe, with a deſign to engage the enemy before the arrival of the ſuccours
                    they expected. Accordingly he encouraged his men, and, with his army in
                    battle-array, advanced to the piâce where the enemy was encamped. '1 he Latins,
                    who were much ſuperior to the Romans in numbers, and beſides began to want
                    proviſions, did not decline the engagement. Titus Tarquinius, at the head of the
                    Roman exiles and deſertcrs, was in the centre, Mami-hſis in the right wing, and
                    Sextus Tarquinius in the left. In the Roman army the dictator commanded in the
                    centre, Æbutius in the left wing, and Virginius in the right.</p>
                <p>The firſt body which advanced was that of the dictator ; and, as ſoon as it
                    began to march, T. Tarquinius, ſinglmg out the dictator, ran full ſpeed againſt
                    him. The dictator did not decline the encounter, but, iiying at his adverſary,
                    wounded him with a javelin in the right ſide. Upon this, the firſt line of the
                    Latins advanced to cover their general ; but he being carried out of the field,
                    they made but a faint reſiſtance when charged bv the troops of the dictator.
                    They were deſtitute of a leader ; and therefore began to retire, when
                    fi&gt;extus Tarquinius, taking the place of his brother, brought them back
                    to the charge, and renewed the fight with ſuch vigour, that the victory in the
                    centre was ſtill doubtlul. On the ſide of Mamilius and Æbutius, both parties,
                    encouraged by the example of their leaders, fought.with incredible bravery and
                    reſolution. After a long and bloody conteſt, the two generals »greed to
                    determine the doubtful victory by a ſingle combat. Accordingly the champions
                    puſlitd on their horſes againſt each other. Æbuâuâ with his lance</p>
                <p>wounded Mamilius in the breaſt ; and Mamilius with his ſword Æbutius in the
                    right arm. Neither of the wounds were mortal ∣ but, both generals falling from
                    their horſes, put an end to the combat. Marcus Valerius, the brother of
                    Poplicola, ſupplying the place of Æbutius, endeavoured, at the head of the Roman
                    horſe, to break the enemy’s battalions ; but was repulſed by the cavalry of the
                    Roman royaliſts. At the ſame time Mamilius appeared again in the van, with a
                    conſiderable body of horſe and flight-armed infantry. Valerius, with the
                    aſſiſtance of his two nephews, the ſons of Poplicola, and a choſen troop of
                    volunteers, attempted to break through the Latin battalions, in order to engage
                    Mamilius ; but, being ſurrounded by the Roman exiles, he received a mortal wound
                    in hi⅜ ſide, ſell from his horſe, and died. The dead body was carried off by the
                    two ſons of Poplicola, in ſpite of the utmoſt efforts of the exiles, and
                    delivered to Valerius’s ſervants, who conveyed it to the Roman camp; but the
                    young heroes being alterwards inveſted on alt ſides, and overpowered by numbers,
                    were both killed on the ſpot. Upon their death, the left wing of the Romans
                    began to give ground, but were ſoon brought back by Poſthumius ; who, with a
                    body of Roman knights, flyiqg to their aſſiſtance, charged the royaliſts with
                    ſuch fury, that they were, after an obſtinate reſiſtance, obliged to give way,
                    and retire in the utmoſt confuſion. In the mean time Titus Horminius, one of the
                    dictator’s lieutenants, having rallied thoſe who had fled, ſell upon ſome cloſe
                    battalions of the enemy’3 right wing, which ſtill kept their ground under the
                    command of Mamilius, killed him with his own hand, and put that body to flight.
                    But while he was buſy in ſtripping the body of his enemy, he received himſelf a
                    wound, of whichhe died ſoon after.</p>
                <p>Sextus Tarquinius in the mean time maintained the fight with great bravery, at
                    the head of the left wing* againſt the conſul Virginius ; and had even broke
                    thro’ the right wing of the Roman army, when the dictator attacked him
                    unexpectedly with his victorious ſqua-drons. ſt hen Sextus, having loſt at once
                    all hopes of victory, threw <hi rend="sup">,</hi> himſelf, like one in
                    deſpair, into the midſt of the Roman knights, and there ſunk under a multitude
                    of wounds, after he had diſtinguiſhed himſelf in a moſt eminent manner. The
                    death of the three generals was followed by the entire defeat of the Latin army.
                    Their camp was taken and plundered, and moſt of their troops cut in pieces; for,
                    of the 43,oco men who came into the field, ſcarce 10,000 returned home. The next
                    morning the Volſci and Hernici came, according to their agreement, to aſſiſt the
                    Latins ; but finding, upon their arrival, how matters had gone, ſome of them
                    were for falling upon the Romans before they could recover from the fatigue of
                    the preceding day ; but others thought it more ſafe to ſend ambaſſadors to the
                    dictator, to congratulate him on his victory, and aſſure him that they had leſt
                    their own country with no other deſign than to afliſt Rome in ſo dangerous a
                    war. Poſthumius, by producing their courier’s and letters, gave them to
                    underſtand that he w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> as well appriſed of their deſigns
                    and treacherous proceedings. However, out of a regard to the law of nations, he
                    ſent them back unhurt, with a challenge to their generals to fight the next day
                    ; but the Volſei, and their confederates,. aot caring to engage a victorious
                    army, de-</p>

                <p>camped in the night, and returned to their reſpective countries before bi eak of
                    day.</p>
                <p>The Latins having now no remedy but an entire ſubmiſſion, ſent ambaſſadors to
                    ſolicit a peace at Rome, yielding themſelves abſolutely to the judgment of the
                    ſenate. As Rome had long ſince made it a maxim to ſpare the nations that
                    ſubmitted, the motion of Titus Lartius, the late dictator, prevailed ; and the
                    ancient treaties with the Latins were renewed, on condition, however, that they
                    ſhould reſtore the priſoners they had taken, deliver up the deſerters, and drive
                    the Roman exiles out of Latium. Thus ended the laſt war which the Romans waged
                    with their neighbours on account of their baniſhed king ; who, being now
                    abandoned by the Latins, Hetrurians, and Sabines, retired into Campania, to
                    Ariſtodemus tyrant of Cumae, and there died, in the 9cth year of his age and
                    14th of his exile.</p>
                <p>The Romans were no ſooner freed ſrom theſe dangerous wars, than they began to
                    oppreſs one another ; •and thoſe domeſtic fends took place which continued more
                    or leſs during the whole time of the republic. 'T he firſt diſturbances were
                    occaſioned by the oppreſſion of the plebeians who were debtors to the
                    patricians. The ſenate, who were at the head of the patricians, choſe to the
                    conſulate one Appius Claudius, who violently oppoſed the pretenſions of the
                    plebeians ; but gave him for his colleague one P. Servilius, who was of a quite
                    contrary opinion and diſpoſition. The conſequence of this was, that the conſuls
                    diſagreed ; the ſenate did not know what to determine, and the people were ready
                    to revolt. In the midſt of theſe diſtur-bances, an army of the Volſci advanced
                    towards Rome; the people refuſed to ſerve; and had not Servilius procured ſome
                    troops who ſerved out of a perſonal affection to himſelf, the city would have
                    been in great danger.</p>
                <p>But though the Volſci were ſor this time driven back, they had ran intention of
                    dropping their deſigns; they engaged in an alliance with them the Hernici and
                    •Sabines. In the mean time, the diſputes at Rome continued with as much violence
                    as ever. Nay, though they were expreſsly told that the Volſcian army was on its
                    •way to beſiege the city, the plebeians abſolutely refilled to march againſt
                    them ; ſaying, that it was the ſame thing whether they were chained by their own
                    countrymen or by 'the enemy. In this extremity Servilius promiled, that when the
                    enemy were repulſed the ſenate would remit all the debts of the plebeians. This
                    having engaged them to ſerve, the conſul marched out at their head, defeated the
                    enemy in a pitched battle, and took their capital, giving it up to be plundered
                    by his ſoldiers, without reſerving any pail for the pu-ſhlic treaſury.</p>
                <p>Whatever might have been the reaſons of Servilius for this ſtep, it furniſhed
                    Appius with a pretence for refilling him a triumph, as a man of a ſeditious
                    diſpoſition, who aimed at popularity by an exceſſive indulgence and profuſeneſs
                    to his ſoldiers. Servilius, incenſed at this injuſtice, and encouraged by the
                    acclamations of the people, decreed himſelf a triumph m ſpite x&gt;f Appius
                    and the ſenate. After this he marched againſt the Aurunci, who had -entered
                    Latium ; and, in ’conjunction with Poſthumius Regillens, he utterly defeated
                    them, and obliged them to retire into their own country. But neither the
                    ſervicre of the general nor</p>
                <p>his ſoldiers could mollify the ſenate and patrician party. Appius even doubled
                    the ſeverity of his judgments, and impriſoned all thoſe who had been ſet at
                    liberty during the war. The priſoners cried for relief to Ser-vilins ; but he
                    could not obtain the aceomplilhment oſ thoſe promiſes which the ſenate never had
                    meant to perform ; neither did he chooſe to quarrel openly with the whole
                    patrician body ; ſo that, ſtriving to preſerv; the friendſhip of both parties,
                    he incurred the hatred of the one and the contempt of the other. Perceiving
                    therefore that he had loſt all his intereſt with the pk beians, he joined with
                    the patricians againſt theιn ; but the plebeians ruſhing tumultuouſly into the
                    forum, made ſuch a noiſe, that no ſentence pronounced by th <hi rend="sup">,</hi> judges could be heard, and the utmoſt confuſion prevailed through the
                    whole city. Several propoſals were made to accommodate matters $ but through the
                    obſtinacy of Appius and the majority of the ſenators, they all came to nothing.
                    In the mean time it was nec&lt;fi-ſary to raiſe an army againſt the Sabines,
                    who had invaded the territories of the republic ; but the people refuſed to
                    ſerve. Manius Valerius, however, brother to the celebrated Poplicola, once more
                    prevailed upon them to march out againſt the common enemy ; having previouſly
                    obtained aſſurances from the ſenate that dιeir grievances ſhould be redreſſed.
                    But no ſooner had victory declared in favour of the Romans, than the ſenate,
                    apprehending that the ſoldiers at their return would challenge Valerius, who had
                    been nominated dictator, for the performance of tſheir promiſes, deſired him and
                    the two conſuls to detain them ſtill in the field, under pretence that the war
                    was not quite finilh-ed. The conſuls obeyed ; but the dictator, whoſe an*
                    thority did not depend on the ſenate, diſbanded his army, and declared his
                    foſhſhers free from the oath which they had taken ; and as a further proof of
                    his attachment to the plebeians, he choſe out of that order 400, whom he
                    inveſted with the dignity of knights. After this he claimed the accomphſhment of
                    the promiſes made by the ſenate : but inſtead of performing them, he had the
                    mortification to hear himſelf loaded with reproaches ; on which he reſigned his
                    office as dictator, and acquainted the people with his inability to fulfil his
                    engagements to them. No ſooner were theſe tranſactions known in the army, than
                    the ſoldiers, to a man, deſerted the conſuls and other officers, and retired to
                    a hill called afierwatds <hi rend="italic">Mans Surer,</hi> three miles from
                    Rome, where they continued to obſerve an exact diſcipline, offering no ſort of
                    violence whatever. The ſenate, after taking proper meaſures for the defence of
                    the city, ſent a deputation to the malecontents ; but it was anſwered with
                    contempt. In ſhort, all things tended to a civil war, when at laſt matters were
                    com-promiſed by the inſtitution of tribunes of the people, who had power to
                    prevent the paſſing of any law that might be prejudicial to the people, and
                    whoſe perſons were declared ſacred, inſomuch that whoever offered the leaſt
                    violence to the perſen of a tribune was declared accurſed, his effects were to
                    be conſecrated to Ceres, and he himſelf might be killed with impunity ; and all
                    the Remans were to engage themſelves, in their own name and that of their
                    poſterity, never to repeal this law <hi rend="sup">r</hi> . The people, after
                    theſe regulations, erected an altar to Jupiter the Terrible, on the top of the
                    bill where their camp had ſtood ; and when they had offer-</p>

                <p>ed ſacrifices to the god, and conſecrated the place of their retreat, they
                    returned to Rome, led by their new magiſtrates and the deputies of the ſenate.</p>
                <p>Thus the Roman conſtitution, which had originally been monarchic, and from
                    thence had paſſed into an ariſtocracy, began now to verge towards a democracy.
                    The tribunes immediately after their election obtained permiſſion from the
                    ſenate to elect two perſons as their miniſters or aſſiſtants, who ſhould eaſe
                    them a little in the great multiplicity of their affairs. Theſe were called <hi

                    ſimply <hi rend="italic">tdiles.</hi></p>
                <p>All oppoſition to the making of regular levies being now at an end, the conſul
                    Cominius led an army againſt the Volſci. He defeated them in battle, and took
                    from them Longula and Poluſca ; after which he beſieged Corioli, a city ſtrongly
                    fortified, and which might be called their capital. He carried this place, and
                    gained a victory over the Antiates, the ſame day ; but Caius Marcius, an eminent
                    patrician, had all the glory of both actions. The troops detached by the conſul
                    to ſcale the walls of Corioli being repulſed in their firſt aſſault, Marcius
                    rallied the runaways, led them on afreſh to the charge, drove back the enemy
                    within their walls, and, entering the city with them, made himſelf maſter of it.
                    This exploit atchieved, he with all expedition put himſelf iιr the foremoſt
                    ranks of the conſul’s main army, that was juſt going to engage with the
                    Antiates, who were come to the relief of the place ; and there he behaved with
                    equal bravery, and had equal ſucceſs.</p>
                <p>The next day the conſul, having erected his tribunal before his tent, called the
                    ſoldiers together. His whole ſpeech to them was little more than a panegyric
                    upon Marcius. He put a crown upon his head ; aſſigned him a tenth part of all
                    the ſpoil ; and, in the name of the republic, made him a preſent of a fine horſe
                    with ſtately furniture, giving him leave at the ſame time to chooſe out any ten
                    of the priſoners for himſelf ; and laſtly, he allotted him as much money as he
                    could carry away. Of all theſe offers Marcius accepted only the horſe, and one
                    captive of the ten, an old friend of his family, that he might give him his
                    liberty. To add to the glory of the brave warrior, the conſul beſtowed on him
                    the ſurname of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> transferring thereby from
                    himſelf to Marcius all the honour of the conqueſt of Corioli. Cominius, at his
                    return to Rome, diffland∙ ed his army ; and war was ſucceeded by works of
                    religion, public games, and treaties of peace. A cenſus and a luſtrum cloſed the
                    events of this memorable con-fulſhip. There appeared to be in Rome at this time
                    no more than 110,000 men fit to bear arms; a number by many thouſands leſs than
                    at the laſt enrollment. Donbt-leſs great numbers had run away to avoid being
                    ſlaves</p>
                <p>to their creditors.</p>
                <p>Under the following adminiſtration of T. Geganius and P. Minucius, Rome was
                    terribly afflicted by a famine, occaſioned chiefly by the neglect of ploughing
                    and ſowing during the late troubles ; for the ſedition had happened after the
                    autumnal equinox, about ſow-ing-time, and the accommodation was not made till
                    juſt before the winter ſolſtice. The ſenate diſpatched agents into Hetruria,
                    Campania, the country of the</p>
                <p>Volſci, and even into Sicily, to buy corn. Thoſe who embarked for Sicily met
                    with a tempeſt which retarded their arrival at Syracuſe ; where they were
                    conſtrained to paſs the winter. At Cumæ, the tyrant Ariſtodemus ſeized the money
                    brought by the commiſſaries ; and they themſelves with difficulty ſaved their
                    lives by flight. The Volſei, far from being diſpoſed to ſuc-cour the Romans,
                    would have marched againſt them, if a ſudden and moſt deſtructive peſtilence had
                    not defeated their purpoſe. In Hetruria alone the Roman commiſſaries met with
                    ſucceſs. They ſent a conſiderable quantity of grain ſrom thence to Rome in barks
                    : but this was in a ſhort time conſumed, and the miſery became exceſſive : the
                    people were reduced to eat any thing they could get ; and nature in ſo great
                    extremity loathed nothing.</p>
                <p>During this diſtreſe a deputation came from Velitræ a Volſcian city, where the
                    Romans had formerly planted a colony, repreſenting that nine parts in ten of its
                    inhabitants had been ſwept away by a plague, and praying the Romans to ſend a
                    new colony to re-people it. The conſcript fathers without much heſitation
                    granted the requeſt, preſſed the departure of the colony, and without delay
                    named three leaders to conduct it.</p>
                <p>The people at firſt were very well pleaſed with the propoſal, as it gave them a
                    proſpect of relief in their hunger : but when they reflected on the terrible
                    havoc the plague had made among the old inhabitants of Velitræ, they began to
                    ſear that the place might be ſtill infected ; and this apprehenſion became ſo
                    univerſal, that not one of them would conſent to go thither. Nevertheleſs the
                    ſenate at length publiſhed a decree that all the citizens ſhould draw lots ; and
                    that thoſe to whoſe lot it ſell to be of the colony ſhould inſtantly march for
                    Velitræ, or ſuffer the ſevereſt puniſhments for their diſobedience : ſear and
                    hunger made the people comply ; and the fathers, a few days after, ſent away a
                    ſecond colony to Norba, a conſiderable city of Latium. But the patricians were
                    diſappointed as to the benefit they expected from theſe meaſures. The plebeians
                    who remained in Rome being more and more preſſed by hunger and want, grew daily
                    more angry with the ſe-nate. At firſſ they aſſembled in ſmall companies to vent
                    their wrath in abuſive complaints ; and at length, in one great body, ruffled
                    all together into the forum, calling out upon their tribunes for ſuccour.</p>
                <p>The tribunes made it their buſineſs to heighten the general diſcontent. Having
                    convened the people, Spu-rius Icilius, chief of the college of tribunes,
                    inveighed moſt bitterly againſt the ſenate ; and when he had end? ed his
                    harangue, exhorted others to ſpeak freely their thoughts ; particularly, and by
                    name, calling upon Brutus and Sicinius, the ringleaders of the former ſedition,
                    and now ædiles. Theſe men, far from attempting to extinguiſh the fire, added
                    freſh fuel to it : And the more to inflame the ſpirits of the multitude, they
                    enumerated all the paſt inſults which the people had ſuffer-ed from the nobles.
                    Brutus concluded his harangue with loudly threatening, that if the plebeians
                    would follow his advice, he would ſoon oblige thoſe men who had cauſed the
                    preſent calamity to find a remedy for it ; after which the aſſembly was
                    diſmiſſed.</p>
                <p>The next day, the conſuls, greatly alarmed at this commotion, and apprehending
                    from the menaces of Brutus ſome very miſehievous event, thought it advi-</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0349" facs="gri_33125011196389_0355.tif"/>
                <p>fable to convene the ſenators, that they might conſider of the beſt means to
                    avert the impending evil. The fathers could not agree in opinion. Some were for
                    employing ſoft words and fair promiſes to quiet and gain over the moſt
                    turbulent. But Appius’s advice prevailed : which was, that the conſuls ſhould
                    call the people together, aſſure them that the patricians had not brought upon
                    them the miſeries they ſuffered, and promiſe, on the part of the ſenate, all
                    poſſible care to provide for their neceſſities ; but at the ſame time ſhould
                    reprove the diſturbers of the public peace, and threaten them with the ſevereſt
                    puniſhments if they did not amend their behaviour.</p>
                <p>When the conſuls, towards the cloſe of the day, having aſtembled the people,
                    would have ſigniſied to them the diſpoſition and intention of the ſenate, they
                    were interrupted by the tribunes. A diſpute enſued, in which no order or decency
                    was obſerved on either ſide. Several ſpeaking at the ſame time, and with great
                    vopiſe-ιation, no one could be well underſtood by the audience. The conſuls
                    judged, that being the ſuperior magiſtrates, their authority extended to all
                    aſſemblies of the citizens. On the other ſide, it was pretended, that the
                    aſſemblies of the people were the province of the tribunes, as the ſenate was
                    that of the conſuls.</p>
                <p>The diſpute grew warm, and both parties were ready to come to blows ; when
                    Brutus having put ſome queſtions to the conſuls, ended it for that time. Next
                    day he propoſed a law which was carried, that no perſon whatever ſhould
                    interrupt a tribune when ſpeaking in an aſſembly of the people ; by which means
                    the influence and power of the popular party was conſiderably increaſed, and the
                    tribunes became formidable opponents to the conſuls and patricians. An
                    opportunity ſoon offered for both parties to try their ſtrength. A great fleet
                    of ſhips laden with com from Sicily, a great part of which was a preſent from
                    Gelon the king of that country to the Romans, and the reſt purchaſed by the
                    ſenate with the public money, raiſed their ſpirits once more.</p>
                <p>But Coriolanus incurred their reſentment, by inſiſt-ing that it ſhould not be
                    diſtributed till the grievances of the ſenate were removed. For this, the
                    tribunes ſum-monei him to a trial before the people, under pretence that he
                    aſpired at the ſovereignty.</p>
                <p>When the appointed day was come, all perſons were filled with the greateſt
                    expectations, and a vaſt con-courſe from the adjacent country aſſembled and
                    filled up the forum. Coriolanus, upon this, preſented himſelf before the people
                    with a degree of intrepidity that merited better fortune. His graceful perſon,
                    his perſuaſive eloquence, the cries of thoſe whom he had ſaved from the enemy,
                    inclined the auditors to relent. But being confounded with a new charge which he
                    did not expect, of having embezzled the plunder of Antium, the tribunes
                    immediately took the votes, and Coriolanus was condemned to perpetual exile.</p>
                <p>This ſentence againſt their braveſt defender ſtruck the whole body of the ſenate
                    with ſorrow, conſternation, and regret. Coriolanus alone, in the midſt of the
                    tumult, ſeemed an unconcerned ſpectator. He returned home, followed by the
                    lamentations of hundreds of the moſt reſpectable ſenators and citizens of Rome,
                    to take a laſting leave of his wife, his children, and his mother Yeturia. Thue
                    recommending his little children to their care, he left the city, without
                    followers or fortune, to take refuge with Tullus Attius, aman of great power
                    among the Volſcians, who took him under his protection, and eſpouſed his
                    quarrel.</p>
                <p>The firſt thing to be done, was to induce the Volſci to break the league which
                    had been made with Rome; and for this purpoſe Tullus ſent many of his citizens
                    thither, in order to ſee ſome games"at that time celebrating ; but at the ſame
                    time gave the ſenate private information, that the ſtrangers had dangerous
                    intentions of burning the city. This had the deſired effect ; the ſenate iſſued
                    an order that all ſtrangers, whoever they were, ſhould depart ſrom Rome before
                    ſun-ſet. This order Tullus repreſented to his countrymen as an infraction of the
                    treaty, and procured an embaſſy to Rome, complaining of the breach, and
                    demanding back all the territories belonging to the Volſcians, of which they had
                    been violently diſpoſſeſſed ; declaring, war in caſe of a refuſal : but this
                    meſſage was treated by the ſenate with contempt.</p>
                <p>War being thus declared on both ſides, Coriolanus and Tullus were made generals
                    of the Volſcians ; and accordingly invaded the Roman territories, ravaging and
                    laying waſte all ſuch lands as belonged to the plebeians, but letting thoſe of
                    the ſenators remain untouched. In the mean time, the levies w <hi rend="sup">τ</hi> ent on very ſlowly at Rome ; the two conſuls, who were re-elected by the
                    people, ſeemed but little ſkilled in war, and even feared to eιaco unter a
                    general whom they knew to be their ſuperior in the field. The allies alſo ſhowed
                    their fears, and ilowly brought in their, ſuccours ; ſo that. Coriolanus
                    continued to take their towns one after the other. Fortune followed him in every
                    expedition ; and he was now ſo famous for his victories, that, the Volſei left
                    their towns, deſenceleſs to follow him into the field. The very ſoldiers of his
                    colleague’s aιmy came over to him, and would acknowledge no other general. Thus
                    finding himſelf unoppoſed in the field, and at the head of a numerous army, he
                    at length inveſted the city of Rome itſelf, fully reſolved to beſiege it. It was
                    then that the ſenate and the people unanimouily agreed to ſend deputies to him,
                    with propoſals of reſtoration, in caſe he ſhould draw off his army. Coriolanus
                    received their propoſals at the head of his principal officers, and, with the
                    ſternneſs of a general that was to give the law, refuſed their offers.</p>
                <p>Another embaſſy was now ſent forth, conjuring him not to exact from, his native
                    city aught but what became Romans to grant. Coriolanus, however, ſtill perſiſted
                    in his former demands, and granted them but three days in which to finiſh their
                    deliberations. In this exigence, all that was left, was another deputation ſtill
                    more ſolemn than either of the former, compoſed of the pontiffs, the prieſts,
                    and the augurs. Theſe, cloathed in their habits of ceremony, and with a grave
                    and mournful deportment, iſſued ſrom the city, and entered the camp of the
                    conqueror : but all in vain, they found him ſevere and inflexible as before.</p>
                <p>When the people ſaw them return ineffectually, they began to give up the
                    commonwealth as loſt. Their temples were filled with old men, with women and
                    children, who, proſtrate at their altars, put up their ardent prayers ſor the
                    preſervation of their country. Nothing was to be heard but anguiſh and
                    lamentation, nothing to be ſeen but ſcenes of affright and diſtreſs, At length</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0350" facs="gri_33125011196389_0356.tif"/>
                <p>it was foggctted to them, 'that what could not be effected by the interceſſion
                    öf the ſenate or the adjuration of the prieſts, might b⅞ brought about by the
                    tears of his wife, or the commands of his mother. This deputation ſeemed to be
                    reliſhed by all ; and even the ſenate itſelf gave it the fonction öf their
                    authority. Vettnfia, the mother of Coriolanus, at firſt made ſome hesitation to
                    undertake ſo pious a work : however, ſhe at laſt undertook the embaſſy, ând ſet
                    forward from the city, accompanied by many of the principal matrons of Rome,
                    with Vol <hi rend="sup">,</hi> umnia his wiſe, and his two children.
                    Coriolanus, who at â diſtance diſcovered this mournful train of females, was
                    reſolved to give them à denial, and called his officers round him to be witneſs
                    of his reſolution ; but, 'when told that his mother and his wiſe were among the
                    number, he inſtantly came down from his tribunal to meet and embrace them. At
                    firſt, the womens tears and embraces took away the power of words ; and the
                    rough ſoldier himſelf, hard as he was, could not refrain from ſharing in their
                    diſtreſs. Coriolanus now ſeemed much agitated by contending paſſions ; while his
                    mother, who ſaw him moved, ſeconded her words by the moſt perſuaſive eloquence,
                    her tears ; his wife and children hung round him, intreating for protection and
                    pity ; while the fair tram, her comp¾-nio'ns, added their lamentations, and
                    deplored their own and their country’s diſtreſs. Coriolanus for a moment wa's
                    filent, feeling the ſtrong conflict between honour and inclination : at length,
                    as if routed from his dream, he flew to take up his mother, who had fallen at
                    his feet, crying out, " O my mother, thou haft ſaved Rome, but loſt thy ſon.” He
                    accordingly gave orders to draw off the army, pretending to the officers that
                    the city was too ſtrong to be taken. Tullus, who had long envied ſhis glory, was
                    not remiſs in aggravating the lenity of ſhis conduct to his countrymen. Upon
                    their return, Coriolanus was ſlain in an inſurrection of the people, arid
                    afterwards honourably buried, With late and ineffectual repentance.</p>
                <p>The year following, the two conſuls of the former year, Manlius and Fabius, were
                    cited by the tribunes to appear before the people. The Agrarian law, which had
                    been propoſed ſome time before, for equally dividing the lands of the
                    commonwealth among the people, was the object invariably purſued, and they were
                    accuſed of having made unjuſtifiable delays inputting it off.</p>
                <p>It ſeems the Agrarian law was a grant the ſenate could not think of giving up to
                    the people. The conſuls, therefore, made many delays and excuſes, till at length
                    they were once more obliged to have recourſe to a dictator ; and they fixed upon
                    Quintus Cincinna-tιιs, a man who had for ſome time given up all views of
                    ambition, and retired to his little farm, where the deputies of the ſenate found
                    him holding the plough, and dreſſed in the mean attire of a labouring
                    huſhandman. Fie appeared but little elevated with the addreſſes of Λ,∙eιemon.y
                    and the pompous habits they Brought him ; and, upon declaring to him the
                    ſenate’s pleaſure, he teſtified rather a concern that his aid ſhould be w <hi
                        rend="sup"> τ</hi> atιted. However, he departed for the city, where both
                    parties were ſtrongly enſlamed againſt each other : but he was reſolved to ſide
                    with neither; only, by a ſtri’ct attention lo the intereſts off his country,
                    inſtead of gaming the confidence of faction, to Obtain lire tſteem of all.</p>
                <p>Thus, by threats and well-timed ſubmiſſion, he pre· vailed upon the tribunes to
                    put off their law for a time, and carried himſelf ſo as to be a terror to the
                    multitude whenever they reſuſed to enliſt ; and their greateſt encourager
                    whenever their ſubmiſſion deſerved it. Thus, having reſtored that tranquillity
                    to the people which he ſo much loved himſelf, he again gave up the lplen-d <hi
                        rend="sup"> ,</hi> ors of ambition, to enjoy it with a greater reliſh in
                    his little farm.</p>
                <p>Cincinnatυs w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> as not long retired from his office when a
                    freſh exigence of the ſtate once more required his aſſiſtance* The Æqui and the
                    Volſei, who, though ſtill worſted, ſtill were for renewing the war, made new
                    inroads into the territories of Rome. Miιmtius, one of the conſuls who ſucceeded
                    Cincinnatus, was ſent to oppoſe them ; but being naturally timid·, and rather
                    more afraid of being conquered than défiions of victory, his army wηs driven
                    into a defile between two mountains, from which, except through the enemy, there
                    was no cgreſs. This, however, the Æqui had the precaution to fortify ; by which
                    the Roman army was ſo hemmed in on every ſide, that nothing remained but
                    ſubmiſſion to the enemy, famine, or immediate death. Some knights, v.ſho found
                    means of getting away privately through the enemy’s camp, were the firſt that
                    brought the account of this diſaſter to Rome. Nothing could exceed the
                    conſternation of all ranks of people when informed of it. The ſenate at firſt
                    thought of the other conſul ; but not having ſufficient experience of his
                    abilities, they unaninouſly turned their eyes upon Cincin-natus, and reſolved to
                    make him dictator. Cincinuatus, the only perſon on whom Rome could now place
                    her whole dependence, was found, as before, by the meſſengers of the ſenate,
                    labouring in his little field with cheerful induſtry. He was at firſt aſtoniſhed
                    at the enſigns of unbounded power with which the deputies* came to inveſt him ;
                    but ſtill more at the approach or the principal of the ſenate, who came out to
                    meet him. A dignity ſo unlooked for, however-, had no effect upon the ſimplicitv
                    or the integrity of his manners : and being how poſſeſſed of abſolute powder,
                    and called upon to nominate his maſter of the horſe, he choſe a poor man named <hi rend="italic">Tarquitius,</hi> one who, like himſelf, deſpiſed riches
                    when they led to diſhonour. Upon entering the city, the dictator pυ'. on a
                    ſerene look, and intreated all thoſe who were able to bear arms to repair before
                    fun-ſet to the Campus Martius (the place where the levies were made) with
                    neceſſary arms, and proviſions for five days. He put himſelf at the head öf
                    theſe ; and, marching all night with great expedition, he arrived before day
                    within fight of the enemy. Upon his approach, he ordered his ſoldiers to raiſe a
                    loud ſhout, to apprize the conſul's army of the relief that w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> as at hand. The Æqui w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> tre not a little amazed
                    when they ſaw themſelves between two enemies ; but ſtill more when they
                    perceived Cincinnatus making the ſtrongeſt entrenchments -beyond them, to
                    prevent their eſcape, and inclofιiιg them as they bad incloſed the conſul. To
                    prevent this, a furious combat enfiιed ; but the Æqui, being attacked on both
                    ſides, and unable <hi rend="italic">to</hi> refill or fly, begged a ceſſation
                    of arms. They offered the dictator his own terms : he gave them their lives ;
                    but obliged them, in token of ſervitude, to paſs under the yoke, which was two
                    ſpears ſet upright-, and another acroſs, in the form of a gallows beneath which</p>

                <p>the vanquiſhed were to march, Theſe captains and generals he made priſoners of
                    war, being reſerved to adorn his triumph. As ſor the plunder of the enemy’s
                    camp, that he gave entirely up to hi$ own ſoldiers, without reſerving any part
                    for himſelf, or permitting thoſe of the delivered army to have a ſhare. Thus,
                    having re-ſe ued a Roman army from inevitable deſtruction, having defeated a
                    powerful enemy, having taken and fortified their city, and, ſtill more, having
                    refuſed any part oſ the ſpoil, he reſigned his dictatorſhip, after having
                    enjoyed it but % days. The ſenate would have enriched him ; but he declined
                    their proffers, chooſing to retire oκce more to his farm and his cottage,
                    content with temperance and ſame.</p>
                <p>But this repoſe from foreign invaſion did not leſſen the tumults of the city
                    within. The clamours ſor the Agrarian law ſtill continued, and ſtill more
                    fiercely, when Sicinius Dentatus, a plebeian, advanced in years, but of an
                    admirable perſon and military deportment, came forward, to enumerate his
                    hardſhips and his merits. This old ſoldier made no ſcruple of extolling the
                    various merits of his youth ; but indeed his atchieve-ments ſupported
                    oſtentation. He had ſerved his country in the wars 40 years; he had been an
                    officer 30, firſt a centurion, and then a tribune : he had ſought 120 battles,
                    in which, by the force of his ſingle arm, he had ſaved a multitude of lives : he
                    had gained 14 civic, three mural, and eight golden crowns, btſides 83 chains, 60
                    bracelets, 18 gilt ſpears, and 23 horſe-trap-pings, whereof nine were for
                    killing the enemy in ſingle combat : moreover, he had received 47 wounds, all
                    before, and none behind. Theſe were his honours : yet, notwithſtanding all this,
                    he had never received any ſhare of thoſe lands which were won from the enemy,
                    but continued to drag on a life of poverty and contempt ; while others were
                    poſſeſſed of thoſe very territories which his valour had won, without any merit
                    to deſerve them, or ever having contributed to the conqueſt. A eaſe of ſo much
                    hardſhip had a ſtrong effect upon the multitude ; they uuanimouſly demanded that
                    the law might be paſſed, and that ſuch merit ſhould not go unrewarded. It was in
                    vain that ſome of the ſenators roſe up to ſpeak againſt it ; their voices were
                    drowned by the cries of the people. When reaſon, therefore, could no longer be
                    heard, paſſion, as uſual, ſucceeded ; and the young patricians, running
                    furiouſly into the throng, broke the balloting runs, and diſperſed the multitude
                    that offered to oppoſe them. For this they were ſome time after fined by the
                    tribunes ; but their reſolution, nevertheleſs, for the preſent, put off the
                    Agrarian law.</p>
                <p>The commonwealth of Rome had now for near 60 years been fluctuating between the
                    contending orders that compoſed it, till at length, each ſide, as if weary, were
                    willing to reſpire a while from the mutual exertions of their claims. The
                    citizens, now, therefore, ef every rank, began to complain of the arbitrary
                    de-eiſions of their magiſtrates, and wiſhed to be guided by a written body of
                    laws, which being known might prevent wrongs as well as puniſh them. In this
                    both the ſenate and the people concurred’, as hoping that ſuch laws would put an
                    end to the commotions that fo long had haraſſed the ſtate. It was thereupon
                    agreed,, that ambaſſadors ſhould be ſent to the Greek cities in Italy, and to
                    Athens, to bring home ſuch laws ſrom</p>
                <p>thence a3 by experience had been found moſt equî-table and uſeful. For thia
                    purpoſe, three ſenators, Poſthumius, Sulpicius, and Manlius, were fixed upon,
                    and galleys aſſigned to convoy them, agreeable to the majeſty of the Roman
                    people. While they were upon this commiſſion abroad, a dreadful plague
                    depopulated the city at home, and ſupplied the interval of their abſence with
                    other anxiety than that of wiſhe-s for their return. In about a year the plague
                    ceaſed, and the ambaſſadors returned, bringing home a body of law&gt;.,
                    collected ſrom the moſt civilized ſtates of Greece and Italy, which being
                    afterwards formed into tçn tables, and two more being added, made that
                    celebrated code called the <hi rend="italic">Laws of the Twelve Tables,</hi> many fragments of which remain to this day.</p>
                <p>The ambaſſadors were no ſooner returned, than the tribunes required that a body
                    of men ſhould be choſen to digeſt their new laws into proper form, and to give
                    weight to the execution of them. After long debates whether this choice ſhould
                    not be partly made fiom the people as well as the patricians, it was at laſt
                    agreed that 10 of the principal ſenators ſhould be elected, whoſe power,
                    continuing for a year, ſhould be equal to that of kings and conſiſts, and that
                    without any appeal. The peιfons choſen were Appius and Genutiu3, who had been
                    elected conſuls for the en-ſuing year ; Poſthumius, Sulpicius, and M¾nlius, the
                    three ambaſſadors ; Sextus and Romulus, former conſuls ; with Julius Veturius,
                    and Horatius, ſenators of the firſt conſideration.</p>
                <p>The decemviri beingnow inveſted with abſolute powgι&gt; agreed to take the
                    reins of government by turns, and that each ſhould diſpenſe juſtice for a day.</p>
                <p>Theſe magiſtrates, ſor the firſt year, wrought with extreme application : and
                    their work being finiſhed, it was expected that they would be contented to give
                    up their offices ; but having known the charms of power, they were now unwilling
                    to reſign it : they therefore pretended that ſome laws were yet wanting to
                    complete their deſign, and intreated the ſenate for a continuance of their
                    offices ; to which that body aſ-ſented.</p>
                <p>But they ſoon threw off the maſk of moderation ; and, regardleſs either ol the
                    approbation of the ſenate or the people, reſolved to continue themſelves,
                    againſt all order, in the decern virat∣e. A conduct ſo notorious produced
                    diſcontents ; and theſe were as ſure to produce freſh acts of tyranny. The city
                    wa3 become al* moſt a deſert, with reſpect to all who had any thing to· loſe ;
                    and the decemvirs rapacity was then only diſcon-tinued, when they wanted freſh
                    objects to ex-ereiſe it upon. In this ſtate of ſlavery, proſcription, and mutual
                    diſtruſt, not one citizen was found to ſtrike for his country’s freedom ; theſe
                    tyrants continued to rule without controul, being conſtantly guarded, not
                    with-their lictors alone, but a numerous crowd of dependents, clients, and even
                    patricians, whom their vices had confederated: round them.</p>
                <p>In this gloomy ſituation of the ſtate, the Æqui and Volſei, thoſe conſtant
                    enemies of the Romans, undertook their incurſions, reſolved to profit by the
                    inteſtine diviſions of the people, and advanced within about io miles of Rome.</p>
                <p>But the decemviri, being put in poſſeſſion of all the. military as weſt as of
                    the civil power, divided their ar-</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0352" facs="gri_33125011196389_0358.tif"/>
                <p>my into three parts ; whereof one continued with Appius in the city, to keep it
                    in awe ; the other two were commanded by his colleagues, and were led, one
                    againſt the Æqui, and the other againſt the Sabines. The Roman ſoldiers had now
                    got into a method of pu-niffιing the generals whom they diſliked, by ſuffering
                    themſelves to be vanquiſhed in the field. They put it in practice upon this
                    occaſion, and ſhamefully abandoned their camp upon the approach of the enemy.
                    Never was the news of a victory more joyfully received at Rome than the tidings
                    of this defeat : the generals, as is always the caſe, were blamed for the
                    treachery of their men : ſome demanded that they ſhould be depoſed ; others
                    cried out for a dictator to lead the trrops to conqueſt : but among the reſt,
                    old Sicinius Dentatus the tribune ſpoke his ſentiments with his uſual openneſs ;
                    and treating the generals with contempt, ſhowed all the faults of their
                    diſcipline in the camp, and of their conduct in the field. Appius, in the mean
                    time, was not remiſs in obſerving the diſpoſition of the people. Dentatus, in
                    particular, was marked out for vengeance, and, under pretence of doing him
                    particular honour, he was appointed legate, and put at the head of the ſupplies
                    which were ſent from Rome to reinforce the army. The office of legate was held
                    ſacred among the Romans, as in it were united the authority of a general, with
                    the reverence due to the prieſthood. Dentatus, no way ſuſpecting his deſign,
                    went to the camp with alacrity, where ſhe was received with all the external
                    marks of reſpect. But the generals ſoon found means of indulging their deſire of
                    revenge. He was appointed at the head of ιoo men to go and examine a more
                    commodious place for encampment, as he had very candidly aſſiired the commanders
                    that their preſent ſituation was wrong. The ſoldiers, however, who were given as
                    his attendants, were aſſaſſins ; wretches who had long been miniſters of the
                    vengeance of the decemviri, and who now engaged to murder him, though with all
                    thoſe apprehenſions which his reputation, as he was called the <hi rend="italic"
                        > Roman A-Mies,</hi> might be ſuppoſed to inſpire. With theſe deſigns, they
                    led him from the way into the hollow boſom of a retired mountain, where they
                    began to ſet upon him from behind. Dentatus, now too late, perceived the
                    treachery of the decemviri, and was reſolved to ſell his liſe as dearly as he
                    could ; he therefore put his back to a rock, and defended himſelf againſt thoſe
                    who preſſed moſt cloſely. Though now grown old, he had ſtill the remains of his
                    former valour, and killed no leſs than 15 of the aſſailants, and wounded 30. The
                    aiſaffins now therefore, terriſted at his amazing bravery, ihower-ed in their
                    javelins upon him at a diſtance ; all which he received in his ſhield with
                    undaunted reſolution. 7 he combat, though ſo unequal in numbers, was managed for
                    ſome time with doubtful ſucceſs, till at length his aſtailants bethought
                    themſelves of aſcending the rock againſt which he ſtood, and thus poured down
                    ſtones upon him from above. This ſucceeded ; the old ſoldier fell beneath their
                    united efforts, after having ſhown by his death that he owed ſt to his
                    fortitude, and not his fortune, that he had come off ſo many times victorious.
                    The decemviri pretended to join in the general ſorrow for ſo brave a man, and
                    decreed him a funeral, with the firſt military honours : but the greatneſs of
                    their apparent diſtreſs, compared with their</p>
                <p>known hatred, only rendered them ſtill more deteſtabltf to the people.</p>
                <p>But a tranſaction ſtill more atrocious than the former ſerved to inſpire the
                    citizens with a reſolution to break all meaſures of obedience, and at laſt to
                    reſtore freedom. Appius, who ſtill remained at Rome, ſitting one day on his
                    tribunal to diſpenſe juſtice, ſaw a maiden of exquiſtte beauty, and aged about
                    15, paſſing to one of the public ſchools, attended by a matron her nurſe.
                    Conceiving a violent paſſion for her, he reſolved to obtain the gratification of
                    his deſire, whatever ſhould be the conſequence, and found means to inform
                    himſelf of her name and family. Her name was <hi rend="italic">Pirginia,</hi> the daughter of Virginius a centurion, then with the army in the field ; and ſhe
                    had been contracted to Icilius, formerly a tribune of the people, who had agreed
                    to marry her at the end of the preſent campaign. Appius, at firſt, reſolved to
                    break this match, and to eſpouſe her himſelf : but the laws of the Twelve Tables
                    had forbidden the patricians to intermarry with the plebeians ; and he could not
                    infringe theſe, as he was the enacter of them. Nothing therefore remained but a
                    criminal enjoyment ; which, as he was long uſed to the indulgence of his
                    paſſions, he reſolved to obtain. After having vainly tried to corrupt the
                    fidelity of her nurſe, he had recourſe to another expedient, ſtill more guilty.
                    He pitched upon one Claudius, who had long been the miniſter of his pleaſures,
                    to aſſert the beautiful maid was his Have, and to refer thé cauſe to his
                    tribunal for deciſion. Claudius behaved exactly according to his inſtructions ;
                    for entering into the ſchool, where Virginia was playing among her female
                    companions, he ſeized upon her as his property, and was going to drag her away
                    by force, but was prevented by the people drawn together by her cries. At
                    length, after the firſt heat of oppoſition was over, he led the weeping virgin
                    to the tribunal of Appius, and there plauſibly expoſed his pretenſions. He
                    aſſerted, that ſhe was born in his houſe, of a female Have, who ſold her to the
                    wife of Virginius, who had been barren. That he had feve-ral credible evidences
                    to prove the truth of what he ſaid ; but that, until they could come together,
                    it was but reaſonable the Have ſhould be delivered into his cuſtody, being her
                    proper maſter. Appius ſeemed to be ſtruck with the juſtice of his claims. He
                    obſerved, that if the reputed father himſelf were preſent, he might indeed be
                    willing to delay the delivery of the maiden for ſome time ; but that it was not
                    lawful for him, in the preſent <hi rend="sup">-</hi> caſe, to detain her from
                    her maſter. He therefore adjudged her to Claudius, as his flave, to be kept by
                    him till Virginius ſhould be able to prove his paternity. This ſentence was
                    received with loud clamours and reproaches by the multitude : the women, in
                    particular, came round Virginia, as if willing to protect her from the judge’s
                    fury ; while Icilius, her lover, boldly oppoſed the decree, and obliged Claudius
                    to take refuge under the tribunal of the decemvir. All things now threatened an
                    open infαrrection ; when Appius, fearing the event, thought proper to ſuſpend
                    his judgment till the arrival of Virginius, who was then about 11 miles from
                    Rome, with the army. The day following was fixed ſor the trial ; and, in the
                    mean time, Appius ſent letters to the generals to coniine Virginius, as his
                    arrival in town might only ſerve to</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0353" facs="gri_33125011196389_0359.tif"/>
                <p>kindle ſedition among the people. Theſe letters, however, were intercepted by
                    the centurion’s friends, who ſent him down a full relation of the deſign laid
                    againſt the liberty and the honour of his only daughter. Virginius, upon this,
                    pretending the death of a near relation, got permiffioH to leave the camp, and
                    flew to 'Rome, inſpired with indignation and revenge. Ac-cordingly, the next day
                    he appeared before the tribune <hi rend="sup">1</hi> ,to the aftoni(hment of
                    Appius, leading his weeping daughter by the hand, both habited in the deepeſt
                    mourning. Claudius, the accuſer, was alſo there, and began by making his demand.
                    Virginius next ſpoke in turn : he repreſented that his wiſe had many children ;
                    that ſhe had been ſeen pregnant by numbers ; that, if he had intentions of
                    adopting a ſuppoſititious child, he would have fixed upon a boy rather than a
                    girl ; that it was notorious to all, that his wiſe had herſelf ſuckled her own
                    child ; and that it was ſurpriſing ſſuch a claim ſhould be now revived, after a
                    15 years diſeontinuance. While the father ſpoke this with a ſtern air, Virginia
                    ſtood trembling by, and, with looks of perſuaſive innocence, added Weight to all
                    his remon-ſtrances. The people ſeemed entirely ſatisfied of the hardſhip of his
                    caſe, till Appius, fearing what he ſaid might have dangerous effects upon the
                    multitude, interrupted him, under a pretence of being ſufficiently inſtructed in
                    the merits of the cauſe, and finally adjudged her to Claudius, ordering the
                    lictors to carry her off. The lictors, in obedience to his command, ſoon drove
                    off the throng that preſſed round the tribunal ; and now they ſeized upon
                    Virginia, and were delivering her up into the hands of Claudius, when Virginius,
                    who found that all was over, ſeemed to acquieſce in the ſentence. He therefore
                    mildly intreated Appius to be permitted to take a laſt farewel of one whom he
                    had long conſidered as his child ; and ſo ſatisfied, he would return to his duty
                    with freſh alacrity. With this the decemvir complied, but upon condition that'
                    their endearments ſhould paſs in his preſence. Virginius, with the moſt poignant
                    anguiſh, took his almoſt expiring' daughter in his arms, for a while ſupported
                    her head upon his breaft, and wiped away the tears that rolled down her lovely
                    viſage ; and happening to be near the ſhops that ſurrounded the forum, he
                    ſnatched up a knife that lay on the ſhambles, and buried the weapon in her
                    breaſt ; then holding it up, reeking with the blood of his daughter, “ Appius
                    (he cried) by this blood of innocence, I devote thy head to the infernal gods.”
                    Thus ſaying, with the bloody knife in his hand, and threatening deſtruction to
                    whomſoever ſhould oppoſe him, he ran through the city, wildly calling upon the
                    people to ſtrike for freedom, and from thence went to the camp, in order to
                    ſpread a like flame through the army.</p>
                <p>He no ſooner arrived at the camp, followed hy a number of his friends, but he
                    informed the army of all that was done, ſtill holding the bloody knife in his
                    hand. He allied their pardon, and the pardon of the gods, for having committed
                    ſo raſh an action, but af-cribed it all to the dreadful neceſſity of the times.
                    The army, already prediſpoſed, immediately with ſhouts echoed their approbation
                    ; and decamping, left their generals behind, to take their ſtation once more
                    upon mount Aventine, whither they had retired about 40</p>
                <p>years before. The other army, which had been to oppoſe the Sabines, ſeemed to
                    feel a like reſentment, and came over in large parties to join them.</p>
                <p>Appius, in the mean time, did all he could to quell the diſturbances in the city
                    ; but finding the tumult incapable of controul, and perceiving that his mortal
                    enemies, Valerius and Horatius, were the moſt active in oppoſition, at firſt
                    attempted to find ſafety by flight; nevertheleſs, being encouraged by Oppius,
                    who waâ one of his colleagus, he ventured to aſſemble the ſenate, and urged the
                    puniſhment of all deſerters. The ſenate, however, were far from giving him the
                    relief he ſought for ; they foreſaw the dangers and miſeries that threatened the
                    ſtate, in caſe of oppoſing the incenſed army ; they therefore diſpatched
                    meſſengers to them, offering to reſtore their former mode of government. To this
                    propoſal all the people joyfully aſſent-ed, and the army gladly obeyed. Appius
                    and Oppius, one of his colleagues, both died by their own hands in priſon. The
                    other eight decemvirs went into voluntary exile ; and Claudius, the pretended
                    maſter of Virginia, was driven out after them.</p>
                <p>The tribunes now grew more turbulent : they propoſed two laws ; one to permit
                    plebeians to intermarry with patricians ; and the other, to permit them to be
                    admitted to the conſulſhip alſo. The ſenators received theſe propoſals with
                    indignation, and ſeemed reſolved to undergo the utmoſt extremities rather than
                    ſubmit to enact them. However, finding their reſiſtance only increaſe the
                    commotions of the ſtate, they at laſt conſented to paſs the law concerning
                    intermarriages, hoping that this conceſſion would ſatisfy thç. people. But they
                    were to be appeaſed but for a very ſhort time : for, returning to their old
                    cuſtom of refu-fing to enliſt upon the approach of an enemy, the conſuls were
                    forced to hold a private conference with the chief of the ſenate ; where, after
                    many debates, Claudius propoſed an expedient as the moſt probable means of
                    ſatisfying the people in the preſent conjuncture. This was, to create fix or
                    eight governors in the room of conſuls, whereof one half at leaſt ſhould be
                    patricians. This project was eagerly embraced by the people ; yet ſo fickle were
                    the multitude, that though many of the plebeians ſtood, the choice wholly fell
                    upon the patricians who offered themſelves as candidates. Theſe new magiſtrates
                    were called <hi rend="italic">military tribunes ;</hi> they were at firſt but
                    three, afterwards they were increaſed to four, and at length to fix. They had
                    the power and enſigns of conſuls ; yet that power being divided among a number,
                    each fingly was of leſs authority. The firſt that were choſen only continued in
                    office about three months, the augurs having found ſomething amiſs in the
                    ceremonies of their election.</p>
                <p>The military tribunes being depoſed, the conſuls once more came into office ;
                    and, in order to lighten the weight of buſineſs which they were obliged to
                    ſuſtain, a new office was erected, namely, that of <hi rend="italic">cenſors,</hi> to be choſen every fifth year. Their buſineſs was to take an eſtimate of
                    the number and eſtates of the people, and to diſtribute them into their proper
                    claſſes; to inſpect into the-lives and manners of their fellow-citizens ; tö
                    degrade ſenators for miſconduct ; to diſmount knights ; and to turn down
                    plebeians fiom their tribes into an inferior, in caſe of miſdemeanour. The two
                    firſt</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0354" facs="gri_33125011196389_0360.tif"/>
                <p>cenſors were Papirius and Sempronius, 'both patricians; ajιd from this order
                    they continued to be elected for near ιoo years.</p>
                <p>This new creation ſerved to reſtore peace for ſome time among the orders ; and
                    the triumph gained over the Volſcians by Geganius the conſul, added to the
                    univerſal ſatisfaction that reigned among the people.</p>
                <p>This calm, however, was but of ſhort continuance : for, ſome time after, a
                    famine preſſing hard upon the poor, the uſual complaints againſt the rich were
                    renewed ; and theſe, as before, proving ineffectual, produced new ſeditious. The
                    conſuls were accuſed of neglect in not having laid in proper quantities of corn
                    : they, however, diſregarded the murmurs of the populace, content with exerting
                    all their care in attempts to ſupply the preſſing neceſſities. But though they
                    did all that could be expected ſrom active magiſtrates, in providing and
                    diſtributing proviſions to the poor ; yet Spurius Mælius, a rich knight, who had
                    bought up all the corn of Tuſcany, by ſar outſhone them in liberality. This
                    demagogue, inflamed with a ſecret deſire of becoming powerful by the contentions
                    in the ſtate, diſtributed corn in great quantities among the poorer fort each
                    day, till his houſe became the aſylum of all ſuch as wiſhed to exchange a liſe
                    of labour for one of lazy dependence. When he had thus gained a ſufficient
                    number of partizans, he procured large quantities of arms to be brought into his
                    houſe by night, and formed a conſpiracy,, by which he was to obtain, the
                    command, while ſome of the tribunes, whom he had found means to corrupt, were to
                    act under him, in ſeizing upon the liberties of his country. Minucius ſoon
                    diſcovered the plot ; and informing the ſenate thereoſ, they immediately formed
                    the reſolution of creating a dictator, who ſhould have the power of quelling the
                    conspiracy, without appealing to the people. Cincin-nat-us, who was now 8o years
                    old, was choſen once more to reſcue his country from impending danger. He began
                    by ſummoning Mælius to appear ; who refiiſed to obey. He next ſent Ahala, the
                    maſter of his horſe, to force him ; who, meeting him in the forum, and preſſing
                    Mælius to follow him to the dictator’s tribunal, upon his refuſal Ahala killed
                    him upon the ſpot. The dictator applauded the reſolution of his officer, and
                    commanded the. conſpiraror’s goods to be fold, and his houſe tobe demoliſhed,
                    diſtributing his ſtores among the people.</p>
                <p>The tribunes of the people were much enraged at the death of Mælius ; and, in
                    order to puniſh the ſenate, at the next election, inſtead of conſuls, inſiſted
                    upon reſtoring their military tribunes. With this the ſenate were obliged to
                    comply. The next year, however, the government returned to its ancient channel,
                    and conſuls were choſen.</p>
                <p>The Veientes had long been the rivals of Rome ; they had ever taken the
                    opportunity of its internal diſtreſſes to ravage its territories, and had even
                    threatened its ambaſſadors, ſent to complain of theſe injuries, with outrage. In
                    war they had been extremely formidable, and had cut off almoſt all the Fabian
                    family ; who, to the number of 306 perſons, had voluntarily undertaken to defend
                    the frontiers againſt their in-•curſions. It ſeemed now therefore determined,
                    that the city of Veii, whatever it ſhould coſt, was to fall; and the Romans
                    accordingly ſat regularly down before it, prepared for a long and painful
                    reſiſtance. The ſtrength of the place, or the unikilſulneſs of the befie-gers,
                    may be inferred from the continuance of the ſiege, which laſted for 10.years;
                    during which time the army continued encamped round it, lying in winter under
                    tents made of the ſkins of beaſts, and in ſummer driving oi) the operations of
                    the attack. Varions was the ſucceſs, and many were the commanders that directed
                    the ſiege : ſiunetimes all the beſiegers works were ſe·-ſtroyed, and many of
                    their men cut off by ſallies fron» the town ; ſometimes they were annoyed by an
                    army of Veians, who attempted to bring aſſiſtance fron» without. A liege ſo
                    bloody ſeemed to threaten depopulation to Rome itſelf, by draining its forces
                    continually away ; ſo that a law w?s obliged to be mad« for all the bachelors to
                    marry the widows of the ſoldiers who were (lain. In order to carry it on with
                    greater vigour, Furius Camillus was created dictator, and to him was intruſted
                    the ſole power of managing the long protracted war. Camillus, who, without
                    intrigue or any ſolicitation, had raiſed himſelf to the firfl eminence in the
                    ſtate, had been made one of the cen-fors ſome time before, and was conſidered as
                    the head of that office ; he was afterwards made a military tribune, and had in
                    this poſt gained ſeveral advantage% over the enemy. It was his great courage and
                    abilities in the above offices that made him thought moſt worthy to ſerve his
                    country on this preſſing occaſion.. Upon his appointment, numbers of the people
                    flocked to his ſtandard, confident of ſucceſs under ſo experienced a commander.
                    Conſcious, however, that he was unable to take the city by ſtorm, he ſecretly
                    wrought a mine into it with vaſt labour, which opened into the midſt of the
                    citadel. Certain thus of ſucceſs, and finding the city incapable of relief, he
                    ſent to the ſenate, deſiring that all who choſe to ſhare in the plunder of Veii
                    ſhould immediately repair to the army. Then giving his men directions how to
                    enter at the breach, the city was inſtantly filled with his legions,, to the
                    amazement and conſternation of the beſieged, who, but a moment before, had
                    reſted in perfect ſecurity. Thus, like a ſecond Troy, was the city of Veii 1
                    taken, after a 10 years liege, and with its ſpoils enriched the conquerors ;
                    while Camillus himſelf, tranſported with the honour of having ſubdued the rival
                    of his native city, triumphed after the manner of the kings of Rome, having his
                    chariot drawn by four milk-white horſes ; a diſtinction which did not fail to
                    diſguſt the majority of the ſpectators, as they conſidered thoſe as ſacred, and
                    more proper for doing honour to their gods than their generals.</p>
                <p>His uſual good fortune attended Camillus in another expedition againſt the
                    Faliſei ; he routed their army, and beſieged their capital city Falerii, which
                    threatened a long and vigorous reſiſtance. Here a ſchoolmaſter, who had the care
                    of the chilſhen belonging to the principal men of the city, having found means
                    to decoy them into the Roman camp, offered to put them, into the hands of
                    Camillus, as the ſureſt means of inducing the citizens to a ſpeedy ſurrender.
                    The general was ſtruck with the treachery of a wretch whoſe duty it was to
                    protect innocence, and not to betray it ; and immediately ordered him to be
                    ſtripped, his hands tied behind him, and in that ignominious manner to be

                <p>Tlu6 generous behaviour in Camillus effected more than big arms could do : the
                    magiſtrates of the town immediately ſubmitted to the ſenate, leaving to Camillus
                    the conditions of their ſurrender ; who only fined them in a ſum of money to
                    ſatisfy his army, and received them under the protection and into the alliance
                    of Rome.</p>
                <p>Notwithſtanding the veneration which the virtues of Camillus had excited abroad,
                    they ſeemed but little adapted to bring over the reſpect of the turbulent
                    tribunes at home, as they raiſed ſome freſh accuſation againſt him every day. To
                    their other charges they added that of his having concealed a part of the
                    plunder of Veii, particularly two brazen gates, for his own uſe ; and appointed
                    him a day on which to appear before the people. Camillus, finding the multitude
                    ex-aſperated againſt him upon many accounts, deteſting their ingratitude,
                    reſolved not to wait the ignominy of a trial ; but, embracing his wiſe and
                    children, prepared to depart from Rome. He had already paſſed as far as one of
                    the gates, unattended on his way, and unlamented. There he could ſuppreſs his
                    indignation no longer ; but, turning his face to the capitol, and lifting up his
                    hands to heaven, intreated all the gods that his country might one day be
                    ſenſible of their injuſtice and ingratitude ; and ſo ſaying, he paſſed forward
                    to take refuge at Ardea, where he afterwards learned that he had been fined 1500
                    aſes by the tribunes at home.</p>
                <p>The Romans indeed ſoon had reaſon to repent their uſage of Camillus ; for now a
                    more formidable enemy than ever they had met with threatened the republic i an
                    inundation of Gauls, leaving their native woods, under the command of one
                    Brennus, waſted every thing with fire and ſword. It is ſaid that one Cceditius,
                    a man of the loweſt rank, pretended to have heard a miraculous voice, which
                    pronounced diſtinctly theſe words: “ Go to the magiſtrates, and tell them that
                    the Gauls draw near.” The meanneſs of the man made his warning deſpiſed ;
                    though, when the event ſhowed the truth of his prediction, Camillus erected a
                    temple to the unknown Deity, and the Romans invented ſor him the name of <hi
                        rend="italic"> Aius Locutius.</hi> Meſſeriger after meſſenger arrived with
                    the news of the progreſs and devaſtations of the Gauls ; but the Romans behaved
                    with as much ſecurity as if it had been impoſſible for them to have felt the
                    effects of their depredations. At laſt envoys arrived at Rome, imploring the
                    aſſiſtance of the republic againſt an army of Gauls, which had made an irruption
                    into Italy, and now beſieged their city. The occaſion of the irruption and ſiege
                    was this: Arunx, one of the chief men of Cluſium in Hetruria, had been guardian
                    to a young lucumo, or lord of a lucumony, and had educated him in his houſe from
                    his infancy. The lu-cumo, as ſoon as he was of an age to feel the force of
                    paſſion, fell in love with his guardian’s wife ; and, upon the firſt diſeovery
                    of their intrigffe, conveyed het away. Arunx endeavoured to obtain reparation
                    for the injury he had received ; but the lucumo, by his intereſt and money,
                    gained over the magiſtrates: ſo that the injured guardian, finding no protectors
                    in Hetruria, reſolved to make his application to the Gauls. The people among all
                    the Celtic nations, to whom he choſe to addreſs himſelf, were the Senones ; and,
                    in order to engage them in his quarrel, he aquaînted them with the great plenty
                    of Italy, and made them taſte of ſome Italian wines. Upon this the Senones
                    reſolved to follow him ; and a numerous army was immediately formed, which
                    paſſing the Alps, under the conduct of their Hetrurian guide, and leaving
                    theCeltæ in Italy unmoleſted, fell upon Umbria, and poſſeſſed themſelves of a’J
                    the country from Ravenna to Pſeenum. They were about ſix years in fettling
                    themſelves in their new acquiſitions, while the Romans were carrying on the
                    ſiege of Veii. At length Arunx brought the Senones before Cluſium, in order to
                    beſiege that place, his wife and her lover having ſhut themſelves up there.</p>
                <p>The ſenate, being, unwilling to engage in an open war with a nation which had
                    never offended them, ſent an embaſſy of three young patricians, all brothers,
                    and of the Fabian family, to bring about an accommodation between the two
                    nations. Theſe ambaſſadors, being arrived at the camp of the Gauls, and
                    conducted into the council, offered the mediation of Rome; and demanded of
                    Brennus, the leader of the Gauls, What injury the Cluſini had done him ; or what
                    pretenſions any people from a remote country could have upon Hetruria ? Brennus
                    anſwered proudly, that his right lay in his ſword, and that all things belonged
                    to the bräve ; but that, without having recourſe to this primitive law of
                    natnre, he had a juſt complaint againſt the Cluſians, who, having more lands
                    than they could cultivate, had refuſed to yield to him thoſe they left untilled
                    : And what other motives had you yourſelves, Romans (ſaid he), to conquer ſo
                    many neighbouring nations ? You have deprived the Sabines, the Albans, the
                    Fidenates, the Æqui, and the Volſei, of the beſt part of their territories. Not
                    that we accuſe you of injuſtice ; but it is evident, that you thought this to be
                    the prime and rrioſt ancient of all laws, to make the weak give way to the
                    ſtrong. Forbear therefore to intereſt yourſelves for the Cluſini, or allow us to
                    take the part of the people you have ſubdued.”</p>
                <p>The Fabii were highly provoked at ſo haughty an anſwer; but, diſſembling their
                    reſentment, deſired leave to gb into the town, under pretence of conferring with
                    the magiſtrates. But they were no ſooner there, than they began to ſtir up the
                    inhabitants to à vigorous defence ; nay, forgetting their character, they put
                    themſelves at the head of the beſieged in a ſally, in which Q. Fabius, the chief
                    of the ambaſſadors, flew with his own hand one of the principal officers of the
                    Gauls. Hereupon Brennus, calling the gods to witneſs the per-fidiouſneſs of the
                    Romans, and their violating the law of nations, immediately broke up the ſiege
                    of Cluſium, and marched leiſurely to Rome, having ſent an herald before him to
                    demand that thoſe ambaſſadors, who had ſo manifeſtly violated the law of
                    nations, ſhould be delivered up to him. The Roman ſenate was. greatly perplexed
                    between their regard for the law of nations and their affection for the Fabii.
                    The wiſeſt of the ſenate thought the demand of the Gauls to be but juſt and
                    reaſonable : however, as it concerned perſons of great conſequence and credit,
                    the conſcript fathers re∙ ferred the affair to the people aſſembled by curiæ. As
                    the Fabian family was very popular, the curiæ were ſo far from coûdemning the
                    three brothers, that, at the next election of military tribunes, they were
                    choſen the</p>

                <p>firſt. Brennus, looking upon the promotion of the Fabii as an high affront on
                    his nation, haſtened his march to Rome.</p>
                <p>As his army was very numerous, the inhabitants of the towns and villages through
                    which he paſſed left their habitations at his approach ; but he flopped nowhere,
                    declaring that his deſign was only to be revenged on the Romans. The ſix
                    military tribunes, to wit, Fabius, Caeſo Fabius, Caius Fabius, Sulpitius, Q <hi
                        rend="smallcaps"> <hi rend="sub">l</hi></hi> Servilius, and Sextus Cornelius, marched out of Rome at the head of 40,000
                    men, without either ſacri-ſicing to the gods or conſulting the auſpices ;
                    eſſential ceremonies among a people that drew their courage and confidence from
                    the propitious ſigns which the augurs declared to them. As moſt of the military
                    tribunes were young, and men of more valour than experience, they advanced
                    boldly againſt the Gauls, whoſe army was 7Q,000 ſtrong. The two armies met near
                    the river Allia, about ſio furlongs from Rome. The Romans, that they might not
                    be ſurrounded by the enemy, extended their wings ſo ſar as to make their centre
                    very thin. T heir beſt troops, to the number of 24,000 men, they poſted between
                    the river and the adjoining hills ; the reſt they placed on the hills. The Gauls
                    firſt attacked the latter, who being ſoon put into confuſion, the forces in the
                    plain were ſtruck with ſuch terror that they fled without drawing their ſwords.
                    In this general diſorder, moſt of the ſoldiers, inſtead of returning to Rome
                    fled to Veii : ſome were drowned as they endeavoured to ſwim acroſs the Tiber ;
                    many fell in the purſuit by the ſword of the conquerors ; and ſome got to Rome,
                    which they filled with terror and conſternation, it being believed there that
                    all the reſt were cutoff. The day after the battle, Brennus marched his troops
                    into the neighbourhood of Rome, and encamped on the banks of the Anio. Thither
                    his ſcouts brought him word, that the gates of the city lay open, and that not
                    one Roman was to be ſeen on the ramparts. This made him apprehenſive of ſome
                    ambuſcade, it being un-reaſonable to ſuppoſe that the Romans would abandon their
                    city to be plundered and ſacked without making any reſiſtance. On this
                    conſideration he advanced ſlowly, which gave the Romans an opportunity to throw
                    into the Capitol all the men who were fit to bear arms. They carried into it all
                    the proviſions they could get ; and, that they might laſt the longer, admitted
                    none into the place but ſuch as were capable of defending it.</p>
                <p>As for the city, they had not ſufficient forces to defend it ; and therefore the
                    old men, women, and children, ſeeing themſelves abandoned, fled to the
                    neighbouring towns. The Veſtals, before they left Rome, took care to hide every
                    thing appropriated to the gods which they could not carry off. The two
                    palladiums, and the ſacred fire, they took with them. When they came to the
                    Janieulus, one Albinius, a plebeian, who was conveying his wife and children in
                    a caιriage to a place of ſafety, ſeeing the ſacred virgins bending under their
                    load, and their ſeet bloody, made his family alight, put the prieſteſſes and
                    their gods into the carriage, and conducted them to Caere, a city of Hetruria,
                    where they met with a favourable reception. The Veſtals remained at Caere, and
                    there continued to perform the uſual rites of religion ; and hence thoſe rites
                    were called <hi rend="italic">ceremonies.</hi> But while the reſt of the
                    citizens at Rome were providing for their ſafety, about 80 of the moſt
                    illuſtrious and venerable old men, rather than fly from their native city, choſe
                    to devote themſelves to death by a vow, which Fabius the high pontiff pronounced
                    in their names. The Romans believed, that, by theſe voluntary devotements to the
                    infernal gods, 'diſorder and confuſion was brought among the enemy. Of theſe
                    brave old men ſome were pontifices, others had been conſuls, and others generals
                    of armies, who had been honoured with triumphs. To complete their ſacriſice with
                    a ſolemnity and pomp becoming the magnanimity and conſtancy of the Romans, they
                    dreſſed themſelves in their pontifical, conſular, and triumphal robes ; and
                    repairing to the forum, ſeated themſelves there in their curule chairs,
                    expecting the enemy and death with the greateſt conſtancy.</p>
                <p>At length Brennus, having ſpent three days in uſeleſs precaution«, entered the
                    city the fourth day after the battle. He found the gates open, the walls without
                    defence, and the houſes without inhabitants. Rome appeared to him like a mere
                    deſart ; and this ſolitude increaſed his anxiety. He could not believe, either
                    that all the Romans were lodged in the Capitol, or that ſo numerous a people
                    ſhould abandon the place of their nativity. On the other hand, he could nowhere
                    ſee any armed men but on the walls of the citadel. However, having firſt ſecured
                    all the avenues to the Capitol with ſtrong bodies of guards, he gave the reſt of
                    his ſoldiers leave to diſperſe themſelves all over the city and plunder it.
                    Brennus himſelf advanced into the forum with the troops under his command, in
                    good order ; and there he was ſtruck with admiration at the unex·. pected fight
                    of the venerable old men who had devoted themſelves to death. Their magnificent
                    habits, the majeſty of their countenances, the ſilence they kept, their modeſty
                    and conſtancy at the approach of his troops, made him take them for ſo many
                    deities : for they continued as motionleſs as ſtatues, and ſaw the enemy advance
                    without ſhowing the leaſt concern. The Gauls kept a great while at an awful
                    diſtance from them, being afraid to come near them. But at length one ſoldier
                    bolder than the reſt, having out of curioſity touched the beard of M. Papirius,
                    the venerable old man, not being uſed to ſuch familiarity, gave him a blow on
                    the head with his ivory ſtaff. The ſoldier in revenge immediately killed him ;
                    and the reſt of the Gauls following’ his example, ilaughtered all thoſe
                    venerable old men without mercy.</p>
                <p>After this the enemy ſet no bounds to their rage and fury. They plundered all
                    places, dragging ſuch of the Romans as had ſhut themſelves up in their houſes
                    into the ſtreets, and there putting them to the ſword without diſtinction of age
                    or ſex. Brennus then inveſted the Capitol ; but being repulſed with great loſs,
                    in order to be revenged of the Romans for their refifl <hi rend="sub">τ</hi> ance, hg reſolved to lay the city in aſhes. Accordingly, by his command, the
                    ſoldiers ſet fire to the houſes, demoliſhed the temples and public edifices, and
                    raſed the walls to the ground. Thus was the famous city of Rome entirely
                    deſtroyed ; nothing was to be ſeen in the place where it ſtood but a few little
                    hills covered with ruins, and a wide waſte, in which the Gauls who inveſted the
                    Çapitol were encamped. Brennus, finding he ſhould never be able to take a place
                    which nature had ſo well fortified otherwiſe than by famine, turned the ſiege
                    into a blockade. But in the mean time, his</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0357" facs="gri_33125011196389_0363.tif"/>
                <p>army being diſtreſſed for want of proviſions, he ſent out parties to pillage the
                    fields, and raiſe contributions in the neighbouring cities. One of theſe parties
                    appeared before Ardea, where the great Camillus had now ſpent two years in a
                    private liſe. Notwithſtanding the affront he had received at Rome, the love he
                    bore his country was not in the leaſt diminiſhed. The ſenate of Ardea being met
                    to deliberate on the meaſures to be taken with relation to the Gauls, Camillus,
                    more afflicted at the calamities of his country than at his own baniſhment,
                    deſired to be admitted into the council, where, with his eloquence, he prevailed
                    upon the Ardeates to arm their youth in their own defence, and refuſe the Gauls
                    admittance into their city.</p>
                <p>Hereupon the Gauls encamped before the city ; and as they deſpiſed the Ardeates
                    alter they had made themſelves maſters of Rome, they preſerved neither order nor
                    diſcipline in the camp, but ſpent whole days in drinking. Hereupon Camillus,
                    having eaſily perſuaded the youth of the city to follow him, marched out of
                    Aιdeaina very dark night, ſurpriſed the Gauls drowned in wine, and made a
                    dreadful ∩aughter of them. Thoſe who made their eſcape under the ſhelter of the
                    night fell next day into the hands of the peaſants, by whom they were maſſacred
                    without mercy. This defeat of the enemy revived the courage of the Romans
                    ſcattered about the country, eſpecially of thoſe who had retired to Veii after
                    the unfortunate battle of Allia. There was not one of them who did not condemn
                    himſelf for the exile of Camillus, as if he had been the author of it ; and
                    looking upon that great man as their laſt reſource, they reſolved to chooſe him
                    for their leader. Accordingly, they ſent without delay ambaſſadors to him,
                    beſetching him to take into his protection the fugitive Romans, and the wrecks
                    of the defeat at Allia. But Camillus would not accept of the command of the
                    troops till the people aſſembled by curiæ had legally conferred it upon him. He
                    thought the public authority was lodged in the hands of thoſe who were ſhut up
                    iu the citadel, and therefore would undertake nothing at the head of the Roman
                    troops till a commiſſion. was brought him from thence.</p>
                <p>To do this was very difficult, the place being inveſted on all ſides by the
                    enemy. However, one Pontius Co-minius, a man of mean birth, but bold, and very
                    ambitious of glory, undertook it. He put on a light habit, and, providing
                    himſelf with cork, to keep the longer above water, threw himſelf into the Tiber
                    above Rome in the beginning of the night, and ſuffered himſelf to be carried
                    down with the ſtream. At length he came to the foot of the capitol, and landed
                    at a ſteep place where the Gauls had not thought it neceſſary to poſt any
                    centinels. There he mounted with great difficulty to the rampart of the citadel
                    ; and having made himſelf known to the guards, he was admitted into the place,
                    and conducted, to the magiſtrates. The ſenate being immediately aſſembled,
                    Pontius gave them an account of Camillus’s victory ; and in the name of all the
                    Romans at Veii demanded that great captain for their general. There was not much
                    time ſpent in debates: the curiæ being called* together, the act of condemnation
                    which had been paſſed on Camillus was abrogated, and he named dictator with one
                    voice. Pontius was immediately diſpatched with the decree ; and the ſame good
                    fortune which had attended him to the capitol accompanied him in his return.
                    Thus was Camillus, ſrom the ſtate of baniſhment, raiſed at once to be ſovereign
                    magiſtrate of his country. His promotion to the command was no ſooner known, but
                    ſoldiers flocked from all parts to his camp ; inſomuch that he ſoon ſaw himſelf
                    at the head of above 40,000 men, partly Romans and partly allies,.who all
                    thought themſelves invincible under ſo great a general.</p>
                <p>While he was taking proper meaſures to raiſe the blockade of the citadel, ſome
                    Gauls rambling round the place, perceived on the ſide of the hill the print of
                    Pontius’s hands and ſeet. They obſerved likewiſe, that the moſs on the rocks was
                    in ſeveral places torn up. From theſe marks they concluded, that ſomebody had
                    lately gone up to and returned from the capitol. The Gauls immediately made
                    their report to Brennus of what they had obſerved ; and that experienced
                    commander laid a deſign, which he imparted to nobody, of ſurpriſing the place by
                    the ſame way that the Roman had aſcended. With this view he choſe out of the
                    army ſuch ſoldiers as had dwelt in mountainous countries, and been accuſtomed
                    from their youth to climb precipices. Theſe he ordered, after he had well
                    examined the nature of the place, to aſcend in the night the ſame way that was
                    marked out ſor them ; climbing two abreaſt, that one might ſupport the other in
                    getting up the ſteep parts of the precipice. By this means they advanced with
                    much difficulty from rock to rock, till they arrived at the foot of the wall.
                    They proceeded with ſuch ſilence, that they were not diſcovered or heard, either
                    by the centinels who were upon guard in the citadel, or even by the dogs, that
                    are uſually awaked and alarmed at the leaſt noiſe. But though they eluded the
                    ſagacity of the dogs, they could not eſcape the vigilance of the geeſe. A flock
                    of theſe birds was kept in a court of the capitol in honour of Juno, and near
                    her temple. Notwithſtanding the want of proviſions in the garriſon, they had
                    been ſpared out of religion ; and as theſe creatures are naturally quick of
                    hearing, they were alarmed at the firſt approach of the Gauls ; ſo that running
                    up and down, with their cackling and beating of their wings, they awaked
                    'Manlius, a gallant ſoldier, who ſome years before had been conſul. He founded
                    an alarm, and was the firſt man who mounted the ram-part, where he found two
                    Gauls already upon the wall. One of theſe offered to diſeharge a blow at him
                    with his battle-ax; but Manlius cut off his right hand at one blow, and gave the
                    other ſuch a puſh with his buckler, that he threw him headlong from the top of
                    the rock to the bottom. He, in his fall, drew many others with him ; and, in the
                    mean time, the Romans crowding to the place, preſſed upon the Gauls, and tumbled
                    them one over another. As the nature of the ground would not ſuffer them to make
                    a regular retreat, or even to fly, moſt of them, to avoid the ſwords of the
                    enemy, threw themſelves down the precipice, ſo that very few &lt;τ <hi
                        rend="sub"> θ</hi> t ſafe back to their camp..</p>
                <p>As it was the cuſtom of the Romans at that time not to ſuffer any commendable
                    action to go unrewarded, the tribune Sulpitius aſſembled his troops the next
                    morning, in order to beſtow the military rewards on thoſe who, the night
                    before,, had deſerved them. Among theie Manlius was firſt named; and, in
                    acknowledgment of the important ſervice he had juſt rendered the ſtate every
                    ſoldier gave him part of the coin which he receil</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0358" facs="gri_33125011196389_0364.tif"/>
                <p>ved ſparingly from the public ſtock, and a little meaſure of wine out of his
                    ſcanty allowance. An inconſiderable preſent indeed in itſelf, but very
                    acceptable at that time to the perſon on whom it was beſtowed. The tribune’s
                    next care was to puniſh the negligent: accordingly the captain of the guard, who
                    ought to have had an eye over the centinels, was condemned to die, and, purſuant
                    to his ſentence, thrown down ſrom the top of the capitol. The Romans extended
                    their puniſhments and rewards even to the animals. Geeſe were ever after had in
                    honour at Rome, and a flock of them always kept at the expence of the public. A
                    golden image of a gooſe was erected in memory of them, and a gooſe every year
                    carried in triumph upon a ſoft litter finely adorned; whilſt dogs were held in
                    abhorrence by the Romans, who every year impaled one of them on a branch of
                    elder.</p>
                <p>The blockade of the Capitol had already laſted ſeven months; ſo that the famine
                    began to be very ſenſibly felt both by the beſieged and beſiegers. Camillus,
                    ſince his nomination to the dictatorſhip, being maſter of the country, had
                    poſted ſtrong guards on all the roads; ſo that the Gauls dared not ſtir out for
                    fear of being cut to pieces. Thus Brennus, who beſieged the Capitol, was
                    beſieged himſelf, and ſuffered the ſame inconveniences which he made the Romans
                    undergo. Beſides, a plague raged in his camp, which was placed in the midſt of
                    the ruins of the demoliſhed city, his men lying confuſedly among the dead
                    carcaſes of the Romans, whom they had ſlain, and not buried. So great a number
                    of them died in one quarter of the city, that it was afterwards called <hi
                        rend="italic"> Buſta Gallica,</hi> or the place where the dead bodies of
                    the Gauls were burnt. But, in the mean time, the Romans in the Capitol were more
                    pinched with want than the Gauls. They were reduced to the laſt extremity, and
                    at the ſame time ignorant both of the lamentable condition to which the enemy’s
                    army was brought, and of the ſteps Camillus was taking to relieve them. That
                    great general only waited for a favourable opportunity to fall upon the enemy;
                    but, in the mean time, ſuffered them to pine away in their infected camp, not
                    knowing the extreme want the Romans endured in the Capitol, where they were ſo
                    deſtitute of all ſorts of proviſions, that they could no longer ſubſiſt. Matters
                    being brought to this ſad paſs on both ſides, the centinels of the Capitol, and
                    thoſe of the enemy’s army, began to talk to one another of an accommodation.
                    Their diſcourſes came at length to the ears of their leaders, who were not
                    averſe to the deſign.</p>
                <p>The ſenate, not knowing what was become of Camillus, and finding themſelves hard
                    pinched by hunger, reſolved to enter upon a negotiation, and empowered
                    Sulpitius, one of the military tribunes, to treat with the Gauls; who made no
                    great difficulty in coming to terms, they being no leſs deſirous than the Romans
                    to put an end to the war. In a conference, therefore, between Brennus and
                    Sulpitius, an agreement was made, and ſworn to. The Romans were to pay to the
                    Gauls 1000 pounds weight of gold, that is, 45, 000l. Sterling; and the latter
                    were to raiſe the ſiege of the Capitol, and quit all the Roman territories. On
                    the day appointed, Sulpitius brought the ſum agreed on, and Brennus the ſcales
                    and weights; for there were no gold or ſilver coins at that time, metals paſſing
                    only by</p>
                <p>weight. We are told, that the weights of the Gauls were falſe, and their ſcales
                    untrue; which Sulpitius complaining of, Brennus, inſtead of redreſſing the
                    injuſtice, threw his ſword and belt into the ſcale where the weights were; and
                    when the tribune aſked him the meaning of ſo extraordinary a behaviour, the only
                    anſwer he gave was, <hi rend="italic">Ve</hi> <hi rend="italic">victis!</hi> “ Wo to the conquered! ” Sulpitius was ſo ſtung
                    with this haughty anſwer, that he was for carrying the gold back into the
                    Capitol, and ſuſtaining the ſiege to the laſt extremity; but others thought it
                    adviſable to put up the affront, ſince they had ſubmitted to a far greater one,
                    which was to pay any thing at all.</p>
                <p>During theſe diſputes of the Roman deputies among themſelves and with the Gauls,
                    Camillus advanced with, his army to the very gates of the city; and being there
                    informed of what was doing, he commanded the main body to follow him ſlowly and
                    in good order, while he, with the choiceſt of his men, haſtened to the place of
                    the parley. The Romans, overjoyed at his unexpected arrival, opened to make room
                    for him as the ſupreme magiſtrate of the republic, gave him an account of the
                    treaty they had made with the Gauls, and complained of the wrong Brennus did
                    them in the execution of it. They had ſcarce done ſpeaking, when Camillus cried
                    out, “ Carry back this gold into the Capitol; and you; Gauls, retire with your
                    ſcales and weights. Rome muſt not be redeemed with gold, but with ſteel. Brennus
                    replied, That he contravened a treaty which was concluded and confirmed with
                    mutual oaths. “ Be it ſo (anſwered Camillus); yet it is of no force, having been
                    made by an inferior magiſtrate, without the privity or conſent of the dictator.
                    I, who am inveſted with the ſupreme authority over the Romans, declare the
                    contract void. ” At theſe words Brennus flew into a rage; and both ſides drawing
                    their ſwords, a confuſed ſcuffle enſued among the ruins of the houſes, and in
                    the narrow lanes. The Gauls, after an inconſiderable loſs, thought fit to retire
                    within their camp; which they abandoned in the night, not caring to engage
                    Camillus’s whole army, and, having marched eight miles, encamped on the Gabinian
                    way. Camillus purſued them as ſoon as it was day, and, coming up with them, gave
                    them a total overthrow. The Gauls, according to Livy, made but a faint
                    reſiſtance, being diſheartened at the loſs they had ſuſtained the day before. It
                    was not, ſays that author, ſo much a battle as a ſlaughter. Many of the Gauls
                    were ſlain in the action, more in the purſuit; but the greater number were cut
                    off, as they wandered up and down in the fields, by the inhabitants of the
                    neighbouring villages. In ſhort, there was not one ſingle Gaul leſt to carry to
                    his countrymen the news of this fatal cataſtrophe. The camp of the barbarians
                    was plundered; and Camillus, loaded with ſpoils, returned in triumph to the
                    city, the ſoldiers in their ſongs ſtyling him, <hi rend="italic">Romulus,
                        Father of his country,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Second founder of Rome.</hi></p>
                <p>As the houſes of Rome were all demoliſhed, and the walls razed, the tribunes of
                    the people renewed, with more warmth than ever, an old project which had
                    occa-ſioned great diſputes. They had formerly propoſed a law ſor dividing the
                    ſenate. and government between the cities of Veii and Rome. Now this law was
                    revived; nay, moſt of the tribunes were for entirely abandoning their old ruined
                    city, and making Veii the ſole</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0359" facs="gri_33125011196389_0365.tif"/>
                <p>ſeat of the empire. The people were inclined to favour the project, Veii
                    offering them a place fortified by art and nature, good houſes ready built, a
                    wholeſome air, and a fruitful territory. On the other hand, they had no
                    materials for rebuilding a whole city, were quite exhauſted by misfortunes, and
                    even their ſlrength was greatly diminiſhed. This gave them a reluctance to ſo
                    great an undertaking, and emboldened the tribunes to utter ſeditious harangues
                    againſt Camillus, as a man too ambitious of being the reſtorer of Rome. They
                    even inſinuated that the name of Romulus, which had been given him, threatened
                    the republic with a new king. But the ſenate took the part of Camillus, and,
                    being deſirous to ſee Rome rebuilt, continued him, contrary to cuſtom, a full
                    year in the office of dictator; during which time he made it his whole buſineſs
                    to ſup-preſs the ſtrong inclination of the people to remove to Veii. Having
                    aſſembled the curiæ, he expoſtulated with them upon the matter; and, by
                    arguments drawn from prudence, religion, and glory, prevailed upon them to lay
                    aſide ail thoughts of leaving Rome. As it was neceſſary to have the reſolution
                    of the people confirmed by the ſenate, the dictator reported it to the conſcript
                    fathers, leaving every one at full liberty to vote as he pleaſed. While L.
                    Lucretius, who was to give his opinion the firſt, was beginning to ſpeak, it
                    happened that a centurion, who with his company had been upon guard, and was
                    then marching by the ſenate-houſe, cried out aloud, “ Plant your colours,
                    enſign; this is the beſt place to, ſtay in. ” Theſe words were conſider-ed as
                    dictated by the gods themſelves; and Lucretius, taking occaſion from them to
                    urge the neceſſity of ſtaying at Rome, “ An happy omen, (cried he); I adore the
                    gods who gave it. ” The whole ſenate applauded, his words; and a decree was
                    paſſed without oppoſition for rebuilding the city.</p>
                <p>Though the tribunes of the people were defeated by Camillus in this point, they
                    reſolved to exerciſe their authority againſt another patrician, who had indeed
                    deſerved puniſhment. This was Q. Fabius, who had violated the law of nations,
                    and thereby provoked the Gauls, and occaſioned the burning of Rome- His crime
                    being notorious, he was ſummoned by C. Martius Rutilus before the aſſembly of
                    the people, to anſwer for his conduct in his embaſſy. The criminal had reaſon to
                    fear the ſevereſt puniſhment: but his relations gave out that he died, ſuddenly;
                    which generally happened when the accuſed perſon had courage enough to prevent
                    his condemnation, and the ſhame of a public puniſhment. On the other hand, the
                    republic gave an houſe ſituated on the Capitol to M. Manlius, as a monument of
                    his valour, and of the gratitude of his follow-citizens. Camillus cloſed this
                    year by laying down his dictatorſhip: whereupon an interregnum enſued, during
                    which he governed the ſtate alternately with P. Cornelius Scipio and it fell to
                    his lot to preſide at the election of new magiſtrates, when L. Valerius
                    Poplicola, L. Virginius Tricoſtus, P. Cornelius Coſſus, A. Manlius Capitolinus,
                    L. Æmilius Mamercinus, and L. Poſthumius Albinus, were choſen. The firſt care of
                    theſe new magiſtrates was to collect all the ancient monuments of the religion
                    and civil laws of Rome which could be found among the ruins of the demoliſhed
                    city. The laws of the twelve tables, and ſome of the laws of the kings, had been
                    written on braſs, and</p>
                <p>fixed up in the forum and the treaties made with ſeveral nations had been
                    engraved on pillars erected in the temples. Pains were therefore taken to gather
                    up the ruins of theſe precious monuments; and what could not be found was
                    ſupplied by memory. The ponti-hees, on their part, took care to re-eſtabliſh the
                    religious ceremonies, and made alſo a liſt of lucky and unlucky days.</p>
                <p>And now the governors of the republic applied themſelves wholly to rebuild the
                    city; Plutarch tells us, that as the workmen were digging among the ruins of the
                    temple of Mars, they found Romulus’s augural ſtaff untouched by the flames; and
                    that this was looked upon as a prodigy, from whence the Romans inferred that
                    their city would continue for ever. The expence of building private houles was
                    partly defrayed out of the public treaſure. The ædiles had the direction of the
                    works; but they had ſo little taſte for order or beauty, that the city, when
                    rebuilt, was even leſs regular than in the time of Romulus. And though in
                    Auguſtus’s time, when Rome became the capital of the known world, the temples,
                    palaces, and private houſes, were built in a, more magnificent manner than
                    before; yet even then theſe new decorations did not rectify the faults of the
                    plan upon, which the city had been built after its firſt demolition.</p>
                <p>Rome was ſcarce reſtored, when her citizens were alarmed by the news that all
                    her neighbours were combining to her deſtruction. The Æqui, the Volſci, the
                    Hetrurians, and even her old friends the Latins and the Hernici, entered into an
                    alliance againſt her, in hopes of opprefling her before, ſhe had recovered her
                    ſtrength. The republic, under this terror, nominated Camillus dictator a third
                    time. This great commander, having appointed Servilius to be his general of
                    horſe, ſummoned the citizens to take arms, without excepting, even the old men.
                    He divided the new levies into three bodies. The firſt, under the command of
                    A-Manlius, he ordered to encamp under the walls of Rome; the ſecond he ſent into
                    the neighbourhood of Veii; and marched himſelf at the head of the third, to
                    relieve the tribunes, who were cloſely beſieged in their camp by the united
                    forces of the Volſci and Latins. Finding the enemy encamped near Lanuvium, on
                    the declivity of the hill Marcius, he poſted himſelf behind it, and, by
                    lighting, fires, gave the diſtreſſed Romans notice of his arrival. The Volſci
                    and Latins, when they underſtood that Camillus was at the head of an army newly
                    arrived, were ſo terrified, that they ſhut themſelves up in their camp, which
                    they fortified with great trees cut down in haſte. The dictator, obſerving that
                    this barrier was of green wood, and that every morning there aroſe a great wind,
                    which blew full upon the enemy’s camp, formed the deſign of taking it by fire.
                    With this view he ordered one part of his army to go by break of day with
                    fire-brands to the windward ſide of the camp, and the other to make a briſk
                    attack on the oppoſite ſide. By this means the enemy were entirely defeated, and
                    their camp taken. Camillus then commanded his men to extinguiſh the</p>
                <p>flames, in order to ſave the booty, with which he rewarded his army. He then
                    left his ſon in the camp, to guard the priſoners; and, entering the country of
                    the Æqui, made himſelf maſter of their capital city Bola. From thence he marched
                    againſt the Volſci;</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0360" facs="gri_33125011196389_0366.tif"/>
                <p>whom he entirely reduced, after they had waged war with the Romans for the ſpace
                    of 107 years. Having ſubdued this untractable people, he penetrated into
                    Hetruria, in order to relieve Sutrium, a town in that country in alliance with
                    Rome, and beſieged by a numerous army of Hetrurians. But, notwithſtanding all
                    the expedition Camillus could uſe, be did not reach the place before it had
                    capitulated. The Sutrini, being greatly diſtreſſed for want of proviſions, and
                    exhauſted with labour, had ſurrendered to the Hetrurians, who had granted them
                    nothing but their lives, and the cloaths on their backs. In this deſtitute
                    condition they had left their own country, and were going in ſearch of new
                    habitations, when they met Camillus leading an-army to their relief.</p>
                <p>The unfortunate multitude no ſooner ſaw the Romans, but they threw themſelves at
                    the dictator’s ſeet, who, moved at this melancholy fight, deſired them to take a
                    little reſt, and refreſh themſelves, adding, that he would ſoon dry up their
                    tears, and transfer their ſorrows from them to their enemies. He imagined, that
                    the Hetrurians would be wholly taken up in plundering the city, without being
                    upon their guard, or obſerving any diſcipline. And herein he was not miſtaken.
                    The Hetrurians did not dream that the dictator could come ſo ſpeedily from ſuch
                    a diſtance to ſurpriſe them ; and therefore were wholly employed in plundering
                    the houſes and carrying off the booty, or feaſting on the proviſions they had
                    found in them. Many of them were put to the ſword, and an incredible number made
                    priſoners ; and the city was reſtored to its ancient inhabitants, who had not
                    waited in vain for the performance of the dictator’s promiſe. And now, after
                    theſe glorious exploits, which were finiſhed in ſo ſhort a time, the great
                    Camillus entered Rome in triumph a third time.</p>
                <p>, Camillus having reſigned his dictatorſhip, the republic choſe. ſix new
                    military tribunes, Q. Quinctius, Q-_ Servius, L. Julius, L. Aquilius, L.
                    Lucretius, and Ser. Sulpitius. During their adminiſtration the country of the
                    Æqui was laid waſte, in order to put it out of their power to revolt anew ; and
                    the two cities of Cortuoſa and Contenebra, in the lucumony of the Tarquinienſes,
                    were taken from the Hetrurians, and entirely demoliſhed. At this time it was
                    thought proper to repair the Capitol, and add new works to that part of the hill
                    where the Gauls had endeavoured to ſcale the citadel. Theſe works were eſteemed
                    very beautiful, as Livy informs us, even in the time of Auguſtus, after the city
                    was embelliſhed with moſt magnificent decorations.</p>
                <p>And now Rome being reinſtated in her former flouriſhing condition, the tribunes
                    of the people, who had been for ſome time quiet, began to renew their ſeditious
                    harangues, and revive the old quarrel about the diviſion of the conquered lands.
                    The patricians had appropriated to themſelves the Pomptin territory lately
                    •taken from the Volſci, and the tribunes laid hold of this opportunity to raiſe
                    new diſturbances. But the citizens being ſo drained of their money that they had
                    not enough left to cultivate new farms and ſtock them with cattle, the
                    declamations of the tribunes made no impreſſion upon their minds ; ſo that the
                    project vaniſhed. As for the military tribunes, they owned that their election
                    had been defective ; and, leſt the irregularities «f the former comitia ſhould
                    be continued in the ſuc</p>
                <p>ceeding ones, they voluntarily laid down their office. So that, after a ſhort
                    interregnum, during which M. Manlius, Ser. Sulpitius, and L. Valerius Potſtus,
                    governed the republic, fix new military tribunes L. Papirius, C. Sergius, L.
                    Æmilius, L. Menenius, L. Vale· rius, and C. Cornelius, were choſen for the
                    enſuing year, which was ſpent in works of peace. A temple, which had been vowed
                    to Mars during the war with the Gauls, was built, and conſecrated by T.
                    Quinctius, who preſided over the affairs of religion. As there had hitherto been
                    but few Roman tribes beyond the Tiber which had a right of ſuffrage in the
                    comitia, four new ones were added, under the. name of the <hi rend="italic">SteHatina, Tra-montina, Sabatιna,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Arntenſis;</hi> ſo that the tribes were now in all 25, which enjoyed the ſame rights and
                    privileges.</p>
                <p>The expectation of an approaching war induced the centuries to chooſe Camillus
                    one of the military tribunes for the next year. His colleagues were Ser.
                    Cornelius, Q. Servilius, L. Quinctius, L. Horatius, and P. Valerius. As all
                    theſe were men of moderation, they-agreed to inveſt Camillus with the ſole
                    management of affairs in time of war ; and accordingly in full ſenate
                    transferred all their power into his hands ; ſo that he » became in effect
                    dictator. It had been already determined in the ſenate to turn the arms of the
                    republic againſt the Hetrurians ; but, upon advice that the Antiates had entered
                    the Pomptin territory, and obliged the Romans who had taken poſſeſſion of it to
                    retire, it was thought neceſſary to humble them before the republic engaged in
                    any other enterpriſe. The xAntiates had joined the Latin.9 and Hernici near
                    Satricum ; ſo that the Romans, being terrified at their prodigious numbers,
                    ſhewed themſelves very backward to engage : which Camillus perceiving, he
                    inſtantly mounted his horſe, and riding through all the ranks of the army,
                    encouraged them by a proper ſpeech ; after which he diſmounted, took the next
                    ſtandard-bearer by the hand, led him towards the enemy, and cried out, <hi
                        rend="italic"> Soldiers, advance.</hi> The ſoldiery were aſhamed not
                    tς&gt; follow a ge</p>
                <p>neral who expoſed himſelſ to the firſt attack ; and therefore, having made a
                    great ſhout, they fell upon the enemy with incredible fory. Camillus, in order
                    to increaſe their eagerneſs ſtill more, commanded a ſtandard to be thrown into
                    the middle of the enemy’s battalions ; which made the ſoldiers, who were
                    fighting in the firſt ranks, exert all the reſolution they could to recover it.
                    The Antiates, not being able any longer to make head againſt the Romans, gave
                    way, and were entirely defeated. The Latins and Hernici ſeparated from the
                    Volſci, and returned home. The Volſci, ſeeing themſelves thus abandoned by their
                    allies, took refuge in the neighbouring'city of Satricum; which'Camillus
                    immediately inveſted, and took by aſſault. The Volſei threw down their arms, and
                    ſurrendered at diſcretion. He then left his army under the command of Valerius ;
                    and returned to Rome to ſolicit the conſent of the ſenate, and to make the
                    neceſſary preparations for undertaking the ſiege of Antium.</p>
                <p>But, while he was propoſtng this affair to the ſenate, deputies arrived from
                    Nepet and Sutrium, two cities in alliance with Rome in the neighbourhood of
                    He-truria, demanding ſuccours againſt the Hetrurians, who threatened to beſiege
                    theſe two cities, which were the keys of Hetruria. Hereupon the expedition
                    againſt</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0361" facs="gri_33125011196389_0367.tif"/>
                <p>Antium was laid aſide, and Camillus commanded to haſten to the relief of the
                    allied cities, with the troops which Servilius had kept in readineſs at Rome in
                    caſe of an emergency. Camillus immediately ſet out for the new war; and, upon
                    his arrival before Sutrium, found that important place not only beſieged, but
                    almoſt taken, the Hetrurians having made themſelves maſters of ſome of the
                    gates, and gained poſſeſſion of all the avenues leading to the city. However,
                    the inhabitants no ſooner heard that Camillus was come to their relief, but they
                    recovered their courage, and, by barricadoes made in the ſtreets, prevented the
                    enemy from making themſelves maſters of the whole city. Camillus in the mean
                    time having divided his army into two bodies, ordered Valerius to march round
                    the walls, as if he deſigned to ſcale them, while he with the other undertook to
                    charge the Hetrurians in the rear, force his way into the city, and ſhut up the
                    enemy between the beſieged and his troops. The Romans no ſooner appeared but the
                    Hetrurians betook themſelves to a diſorderly flight through a gate which was not
                    inveſted, Camillus’s troops made a dreadful ſlaughter of them within the city,
                    while Valerius put great numbers of them to the ſword without the walls. From
                    reconquering Sutrium, Camillus haſtened to the relief of Nepet. But that city
                    being better affected to the Hetrurians than to the Romans, had voluntarily
                    ſubmitted to the former. Wherefore Camillus, having inveſted it with his whole
                    army, look it by aſſault, put all the Hetrurian ſoldiers without diſtinction to
                    the ſword, and condemned the authors of the revolt to die by the axes of the
                    lictors. Thus ended Camillus’s military tribuneſhip, in which he acquired no
                    leſs reputation than he had done in the moſt glorious of his dictatorſhips.</p>
                <p>In the following magiſtracy of ſix military tribunes, a dangerous ſedition is
                    ſaid to have taken place through the ambition of Marcus Manlius, who had ſaved
                    the capitol from the Gauls in the manner already related. Though this man had
                    pride enough to deſpiſe all the other great men in Rome, yet he envied Camillus,
                    and took every opportunity of magnifying his own exploits beyond thoſe of the
                    dictator. But not finding ſuch a favourable reception from the nobility as he
                    deſired, he concerted meaſures with the tribunes of the people, and ſtrove to
                    gain the affections of the multitude. Not content with renewing the propoſal for
                    the diſtribution of conquered lands, he alſo made himſelf an advocate for
                    inſolvent debtors, of whom there was now a great number, as moſt of the lower
                    claſs had been obliged to borrow money in order to rebuild their houſes. The
                    ſenate, alarmed at this oppoſition, created A. Cornelius Coſſus dictator, for
                    which the war with the Volſci afforded them a fair pretence. Manlius, however,
                    ſtill continued to inflame the people againſt the patricians. Beſides the moſt
                    unbounded perſonal generoſity, he held aſſemblies at his own houſe (in the
                    citadel), where he confidently gave out that the ſenators, not content with</p>
                <p>being the poſſeſſors of thoſe lands which ought to have been equally divided
                    among all the citizens, had concealed, with an intent to appropriate it to their
                    own uſe, all the gold which was to have been paid to the Gauls, and which would
                    alone be ſufficient to diſcharge the debts of all the poor plebeians; and he
                    moreover promiſed to ſhow in due time where this treaſure was concealed. For
                    this aſſertion he was brought before the dictator; who commanded him to diſcover
                    where the pretended treaſure was, or to confeſs openly before the whole aſſembly
                    that he had ſlandered the ſenate. — Manlius replied, that the dictator himſelf,
                    and the principal perſons in the ſenate, could only give the proper intelligence
                    of this treaſure, as they had been the moſt active in ſecuring it. Upon this he
                    was committed to priſon; but the people made ſuch diſturbance, that the ſenate
                    were ſoon after fain to releaſe him. By this he was emboldened to continue his
                    former practices; till at laſt the ſenate gave an order to the military tribunes
                    to</p>
                <p>take care that the commonwealth ſuffered no detriment from the pernicious
                    projects of Marcus Manlius, and even gave them authority to aſſaſſinate him, if
                    they found it neceſſary ſo to do. At laſt, however, he was publicly accuſed of
                    aſpiring to be king; however, the people, it is ſaid, were ſo ſtruck with
                    gratitude, on account of his having delivered the capitol from the Gauls, that
                    they could not reſolve to condemn him. But the military tribunes, who, it ſeems,
                    were bent on his deſtruction, having appointed the aſſembly to be held without
                    the city, there obtained their wiſh. Manlius was thrown headlong from the
                    capitol itſelf: it was thenceforth decreed that no patrician ſhould dwell in the
                    capitol or citadel; and the Manlian family reſolved that no member of it ſhould
                    ever afterwards bear the prænomen of <hi rend="italic">Marcus.</hi> No ſooner
                    was Manlius dead, however, than the people lamented his fate; and becauſe a
                    plague broke out ſoon after, they imputed it to the anger of the gods on account
                    of the deſtruction of the hero who had ſaved the ſtate<note anchored="true"

                <p>The Romans, having now triumphed over the Sabines, the Etrurians, the Latins,
                    the Hernici, the Æqui, and the Volſcians, began to look ſor greater conqueſts.
                    They accordingly turned their arms againſt the Samnites, a people about 100
                    miles eaſt from the city, deſcended from the Sabines, and inhabiting a large
                    tract of ſouthern Italy, which at this day makes a conſiderable part of the
                    kingdom of Naples. Valerius Corvus and Cornelius were the two conſuls, to whoſe
                    care it firſt fell to manage this dreadful contention between the rival ſtates.</p>
                <p>Valerius was one of the greateſt commanders of his time; he was ſurnamed Corvus,
                    from a ſtrange cir-cumſtance of being aſſiſted by a crow in a ſingle combat, in
                    which he fought and killed a Gaul of a gigantic ſtature. To his colleague’s care
                    it was conſigned to lead an army to Samnium, the enemy’s capital; while Corvus
                    was ſent to relieve Capua, the capital of the</p>

                <p>Campanians. The Samnites were the braveſt men the Romans had ever yet
                    encountered, and the contention between the two nations was managed on both
                    ſides with the moſt determined reſolution. But the fortune of Rome prevailed;
                    the Samnites at length fled, averring, that they were not able to withſtand the
                    fierce looks and the fire-darting eyes of the Romans. The other conſul, however,
                    was not at firſt ſo fortunate; for having unwarily led his army into a defile,
                    he was in danger of being cut off, had not Decius, a tribune of the army,
                    poſſeſſed himſelf of an hill which commanded the enemy: ſo that the Samnites,
                    being attacked on either ſide, were defeated with great ſlaughter, no leſs than
                    30, 000 of them being left dead upon the field of battle.</p>
                <p>Some time after this victory, the ſoldiers who were ſtationed at Capua
                    mutinying, forced Quintius, an old and eminent ſoldier, who was then reſiding in
                    the country, to be their leader ; and, conducted by their rage more than their
                    general, came within eight miles of the city. So terrible an enemy, almoſt at
                    the gates, not a little alarmed the ſenate ; who immediately created Valerius
                    Corvus dictator, and ſent him forth with another army to oppoſe them. The two
                    armies were now drawn up againſt each other, while fathers and ſons beheld
                    themſelves prepared to engage in oppoſite cauſes ; but Corvus, knowing his
                    influence among the ſoldiery, inſtead of going forward to meet the mutineers in
                    an hoſtile manner, went with the moſt cordial friendſhip to embrace and
                    expoſtulate with his old acquaintances. His conduct had the deſired effect.
                    Quintius, as their ſpeaker, only deſired to have their défection from their duty
                    forgiven ; and as for himſelf, as he was innocent of their conſpiracy, he had no
                    reaſon to ſolicit pardon for his offences.</p>
                <p>A war between the Romans and the Latins followed ſoon after ; but as their
                    habits, arms, and language, were the ſame, the moſt exact diſcipline was
                    neceſſary to prevent confuſion in the engagement. Orders, therefore, were iſſued
                    by Manlius the conſul, that no ſoldier ſhould leave his ranks upon whatever
                    provocation ; and that he ſhould be certainly put to death who ſhould offer do
                    do otherwiſe. With theſe injunctions, both armies were drawn out in array, and
                    ready to begin ; when Metius, the general of the enemy’s cavalry, puſhed forward
                    from his lines, and challenged any knight in the Roman army to ſingle combat.
                    For ferne time there was a general pauſe, no ſoldier offering to diſobey his
                    orders, till Titus Manlius, the conſul’s own ſon, burning with ſhame to ſee the
                    whole body of the Romans intimidated, boldly iallied out againſt his adverſary.
                    The ſoldiers on both ſides for a while ſuſpended the general engagement to be
                    ſpectators of this fierce encounter. Manlius killed his adverſary ; and then
                    deſpoiling him of his armour, returned in triumph to his father’s tent, where he
                    was preparing and giving orders relative to the engagement. Howſoever he might
                    have been applauded by his fellow-ſoldiers, being as yet doubtful of the
                    reception he ſhould find from his father, he came, with heſitation, to lay the
                    enemy’s ſpoils at his feet, and with a modeſt air inſinuated, that what he did
                    was entirely from a ſpirit of hereditary virtue. But he was ſoon dreadfully made
                    ſenſible of his error, when his father, turning away, ordered him to be led
                    publicly forth before the army, and there to</p>
                <p>have his head ſtruck off on account of his diſobeying orders. The whole army was
                    ſtruck with horror at this unnatural mandate : fear for a while kept them in
                    ſuſpenſe ; but when they ſaw their young champion’s head ſtruck off, and his
                    blood ſtreaming upon the ground, they could no longer contain their execrations
                    ' and their groans. His dead body was carried forth without the camp, and being
                    ‘adorned with the ſpoils of the vanquiſhed enemy, was buried with all the pomp
                    of military diſtreſs.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the battle joined with mutual fury ; and as the two armies had
                    oſten fought under the ſame leaders, they combated with all the animo-ſity of a
                    civil war. The Latins chiefly depended on their bodily ſtrength ; the Romans, on
                    their invincible courage and conduct. Forces ſo nearly matched ſeemed only to
                    require the protection of their deities to turn the ſcale of victory ; and, in
                    fact, the augurs had foretold, that whatever part of the Roman army ſhould be
                    diſtreſſed, the commander of that part ſhould devote himſelf for his country,
                    and die as a ſacriſice to the immortal gods. Manlius commanded the right wing,
                    and Decius led on the left. Both ſides fought for ſome time with doubtful
                    ſucceſs, as their courage was equal ; but, after a time, the leſt wing of the
                    Roman army began to give ground. It was then that Decius, who commanded there,
                    reſolved to devote himſelf for his country, and to offer his own life as an
                    atonement to ſave his army. Thus determined, he called out to Manlius With a
                    loud voice, and demanded his inſtructions, as he was the chief pontiff, how to
                    devote himſelf, and the form of the words he ſhould uſe. By his directions,
                    therefore, being clothed in a long robe, his head covered, and his arms
                    ſtretched forward, ſtanding upon a javelin, he devoted himſelf to the celeſtial
                    and infernal gods for the ſafety of Rome. Then arming himſelf, and mounting on
                    horſeback, he drove furiouſly into the midſt of the enemy, carrying terror and
                    conſternation wherever he came, till he ſell covered with wounds. In the mean
                    time, the Roman army conſidered his devoting himſelf in this manner as an
                    aſſurance of ſucceſs ; nor was the ſuperſtition of the Latins leſs powerfully
                    influenced by his reſolution ; a total rout began to enſue : the Romans preſſed
                    them on every ſide ; and ſo great was the carnage, that ſcarce a fourth part of
                    the enemy ſurvived the defeat. This was the laſt battle of any conſequence that
                    the Latins had with the Romans : they were forced to beg a peace upon hard
                    conditions ; and two years after, their ſtrongeſt city, Pædum, being taken, they
                    were brought under an entire ſubmiſſion to the Roman power.</p>
                <p>A ſignal diſgrace which the Romans ſuſtained about this time in their conteſt
                    with the Samnites, made a pauſe in their uſual good fortune, and turned the
                    ſcale for a while in the enemy’s favour. The ſenate having denied the Samnites
                    peace, Pontius their general was reſolved to gain by ſtratagem what he had
                    frequently loſt by force. Accordingly, leading his army into a defile called <hi
                        rend="italic"> Claudium,</hi> and taking poſſeſſion of all its outlets, he
                    ſent 10 of his ſoldiers, habited like ſhepherds, with directions to throw
                    themſelves in the way the Romans were to march. The Roman conſul met them, and
                    taking them for what the) appeared, demanded the route the Samnite army had
                    taken ; they,, with ſeeming indifference, replied, that they were gone to
                    Luceria, a</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0363" facs="gri_33125011196389_0369.tif"/>
                <p>town in Apulia, and were then actually beſieging it. The Roman general, hot
                    ſuſpecting the ſtratagem that was laid againſt him, marched directly by the
                    ſhorteſt road, which lay through the defiles, to relieve the city ; and was not
                    undeceived till he ſaw his army ſurrounded, and blocked up on every ſide.
                    Pontius thus having the Romans entirely in his power, firſt obliged the army to
                    paſs under the yoke, having been previouſly ſtripped of all but their garments ;
                    he then ſtipulated that they ſhould wholly quit the territories of the Samnites,
                    and that they ſhould continue to live upon terms of former confederacy. The
                    Romans were conſtrained to ſubmit to this ignominious treaty, and marched into
                    Capua diſarmed and half naked. When the army arrived at Rome, the whole city was
                    moſt ſurpriſingly afflicted at their ſhameful return ; nothing but grief and
                    reſentment was to be ſeen, and the whole city was put into mourning.</p>
                <p>But this was a tranſitory calamity : the war was carried on as uſual for many
                    years ; the power of the Samnites declining every day, while that of the Romans
                    continually increaſed. Under the conduct of Papirius Curſor, who was at
                    different times conſul and dictator, repeated triumphs were gained. Fabius
                    Maximus alſo had his ſhare in the glory of conquering them ; and Decius, the ſon
                    of that Decius whom we ſaw devoting himſelf for his country about 40 years
                    before, followed the example of his father, and ruſhed into the midſt of the
                    enemy, imagining that he could ſave the lives of his countrymen with the loſs of
                    his own.</p>
                <p>The ſucceſs of the Romans againſt the Samnites alarmed all Italy. The Tarentines
                    in particular, who had long plotted underhand againſt the republic, now Openly
                    declared themſelves ; and invited into Italy Pyrrhus king of Epirus, in hopes of
                    being able by his means to ſubdue the Romans. The offer was readily accepted by
                    that ambitious monarch, who had nothing leſs in view than the conqueſt of all
                    Italy.— Their ambaſſadors carried magnificent preſents for the king, with
                    inſtructions to acquaint him, that they only wanted a general of fame and
                    experience ; and that, as for troops, they could themſelves furniſh a numerous
                    army of 20,000 horſe and 350,000 foot, made up of Lucanians, Meſſapians,
                    Samnites, and Tarentines. As ſoon as the news of this deputation were brought to
                    the Roman camp, Æmilius, who had hitherto made war on the Tarentines but gently,
                    in hopes of adjuſting matters by way of negociation, took other meaſures, and
                    began to commit all ſorts of hoſtilities. He took cities, ſtormed caſtles, and
                    laid the whole country waſte, burning and deſtroying all before him. The
                    Tarentines brought their army into the field ; but Æmilius ſoon obliged them to
                    take refuge within their walls. However, to induce them to lay aſide the deſign
                    of receiving Pyrrhus, he uſed the priſoners he had taken with great moderation,
                    and even ſent them back without ranſom. Theſe highly extolled the generoſity of
                    the conſul, inſomuch that many of the inhabitants were brought over to the Roman
                    party, and they all began to repent of their having rejected a peace and ſent
                    for Pyrrhus.</p>
                <p>But, in the mean time, the Tarentine ambaſſadors arriving in Epirus, purſuant to
                    the powers they had received, made an abſolute treaty with the kirg.j who</p>
                <p>immediately ſent before him the famous Cyneas, with 3000 men, to take poſſeſſion
                    of the citadel of Tarentum. This eloquent miniſter ſoon found means to depoſe
                    Agis, whom the Tarentines had choſen to be their general and the governor of the
                    city, though a fincere friend to the Romans. He likewiſe prevailed upon the
                    Tarentines to deliver up the citadel into his hands ; which he no ſooner got
                    poſſeſſion of, than he diſpatched meſſengers to Pyrrhus, ſoiicſting him to
                    haften his departure for Italy. In the mean time, the conſul Æmilius, finding
                    that he could not attempt anything with ſucceſs againſt the Tarentines this
                    campaign, reſolved to put his troops into winter-quarters in A-pulia, which was
                    not far from the territory of Tarentum, that was ſoon to become the ſeat of the
                    war. As he was obliged to paſs through certain defiles, with the ſea on one ſide
                    and high hills on the other, he was there attacked by the Tarentines and Epirots
                    from great numbers of barks fraught with baliftæ (that is, engines for throwing
                    ſtones of a vaſt weight), and from the hills, on which were poſted a great many
                    archers and flingers. Hereupon Æmilius placed the Tarentine priſoners between
                    him and the enemy ; which the Tarentines perceiving, ſoon left off moleſting the
                    Romans, out of compaſſion to their own countrymen ; ſo that the Romans arrived
                    ſafe in Apulia, and there took up their winter-quarters.</p>
                <p>The next year Æmilius was continued in the command of his own troops, with the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">proconſul;</hi> and was ordered to make war upon
                    the Salentines, who had declared for the Tarentines. The preſent exigence of
                    affairs obliged the Romans to enliſt the proletarii, who were the meaneſt of the
                    people, and therefore by way of contempt called <hi rend="italic">proletarii,</hi> as being thought incapable of doing the ſtate any other ſervice than that
                    of peopling the city, and {locking the republic with ſubjects. Hitherto they had
                    never been ſuffered to bear arms ; but were now, to their great ſatisfaction,
                    enrolled as well as others. In the mean time Pyrrhus arrived at 'Γarentum,
                    having narrowly eſeaped ſhip-wreck ; and being conducted into the city by his
                    faithful Cyneas, was received there with loud acclamations.</p>
                <p>The Tarentines, who were entirely devoted to their pleaſures, expected that he
                    ſhould take all the fatigues of the war on himſelf, and expoſe only his Epirots
                    to danger. And indeed Pyrrhus for ſome days diffembled his deſign, and ſuffered
                    the Tarentines to indulge without reſtraint in their uſual diverſions. But his
                    ſhips, which had been diſperſed all over the Ionian ſea, arriving one after
                    another, and with them the troops which he had put on board at Epirus, he began
                    to reform the diſorders that prevailed in tire city. The theatre was the place
                    to which the idle Tarentines re-ſorted daily in great numbers, and where the
                    incendiaries ſtirred up the people to ſedition with their harangues : he
                    therefore cauſed it to be ſhut up, as he did likewiſe the public gardens,
                    porticoes, and places of exerciſe, where the inhabitants uſed to.entertain
                    themſelves with news, and ſpeak with great freedom of their governors, cenſuring
                    their conduct, and ſettling the government according to their different humours,
                    which occaſioned great diviſions, and rent the city into various factions. As
                    they were a very voluptuous and indolent people, they ſpent whole days aι∙d
                    nights in feaſts, maſquerades, plays, &amp;c. Theſe therefore Pyrrhus ab-</p>

                <p>fotutely prohibited, as no leſs dangerous than the aſſemblies of prating
                    politicians. They were utter ſtran-gers to military exerciſes, and the art of
                    handling arms; but Pyrrhus having cauſed an exact regiſter to be made of all the
                    young men who were fit for war, picked out the ſtrongeſt amongſt them, and
                    incorporated them among his own troops, ſaying, that he would take it upon
                    himſelf to give them courage. He exerciſed them daily for ſeveral hours ; and on
                    that occaſion behaved with an inexorable ſeverity, inflicting exemplary
                    puniſhment on ſuch as did not attend or ſailed in their duty. By theſe wiſe
                    meaſures he prevented ſeditions among the citizens, and inured their youth to
                    military diſcipline ; and becauſe many, who had not been accuſtomed to ſuch
                    ſeverity and rigour, withdrew from their native country, Pyrrhus, by a public
                    proclamation, declared all thoſe capitally guilty who ſhould attempt to abandon
                    their country, or abſent themſelves from the common muſters.</p>
                <p>The Tarentines, being now ſenſible that Pyrrhus was determined to be their
                    maſter, began loudly to complain of his conduct ; but he, being informed of
                    whatever paſſed among them by his ſpies, who inſinuated themſelves into all
                    companies, privately diſpatched the moſt factious, and ſent thoſe whom he
                    ſuipected, under various pretences, to his ſon’s court in Epirus.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, P. Valerius Lævinus, the Roman conſul, entering the country of
                    the Lucanians, who were in alliance with the Tarentines, committed great ravages
                    there ; and having taken and fortified one of their caſtles, waited in that
                    neighbourhood for Pyrrhus. The king, though he had not yet received any ſuccours
                    from the Samnites, Meſſapians, and other allies of the Tarentines, thought it
                    highly diſhonourable to continue ſhut up in a city, while the Romans were
                    ravaging the country of his friends. He therefore took the field with the troops
                    he had brought with him from Epirus, ſome recruits of Tarentum, and a ſmall
                    number of Italians. But before he began hoſtilities, he wrote a letter to
                    Lævinus, commanding him to diſ-band his army ; and on his refuſal, immediately
                    marched towards thoſe parts where Lævinus was waiting for him. The Romans were
                    encamped on the hither ſide of the river Siris ; and Pyrrhus appearing on the
                    oppoſite bank, made it his firſt buſineſs to reconnoitre the enemy’s camp in
                    perſon, and ſee what appearance they made. With this view he croſſed the river,
                    attended by Megacles, one of his officers and chief favourites ; and having
                    obſerved the conſul’s intrenchments, the manner in which he had poſted his
                    advanced guards, and the good order of his camp, he was greatly ſurpriſed ; and
                    addrelſing Megacles, “ Theſe people (ſaid he) are not ſuch barbarians as we take
                    them to be : let us try them before we condemn them.” On his return, he changed
                    his reſolution of attacking them ; and, ſhut· ting himſelf up in his
                    intrenchments, waited for the arrival of the confederate troops. In the mean
                    time, he poſted ſtrong guards along the river, to prevent the enemy from paſſing
                    it, and continually ſent out ſcouts to diſcover the deſigns, and watch the
                    motions of the conſul. Some of theſe being taken by the advanced guards of the
                    Romans, the conſiſt himſelf led them through his camp, and having ſhewed them
                    his army, ſent them back to the king, telling them, that he had many other
                    troops to ſhow them in due time.</p>
                <p>Lævinus being determined to draw the enemy to a battle before Pyrrhus received
                    the reinforcements he expected, having harangued his troops, marched to the
                    banks of the Siris ; and there drawing up his infantry in battalia, ordered the
                    cavalry to ſſte off, and march a great way about, in order to find a paſſage at
                    ſome place not defended by the enerfiy. Accordingly, they paſſed the river
                    without being obſerved ; and lalling upon the guards which Pyrrhus had poſted on
                    the banks over-againſt the conſular army, gave the infantry an opportunity of
                    croſſing the river on bridges which Lævinus had prepared for that purpoſe. But
                    before they got over, Pyrrhus, haſtening from his camp, which was at ſome
                    diſtance from the river, hoped to cut the Roman army in pieces while they were
                    diiordered with the difficulties of paſſing the river, and climbing up the ſteep
                    banks ; but the cavalry covering the infantry, and ſtanding between them and the
                    Epirots, gave them time to form themſelves on the banks of the river. On the
                    other hand, Pyrrhus drew up his men as faſt as they came ſrom the camp, and
                    performed ſuch deeds of valour, that the Romans thought him worthy of the great
                    reputation he had acquired.</p>
                <p>As the cavalry alone had hitherto engaged, Pyrrhus, who confided moſt in his
                    infantry, haſtened back to the camp, in order to bring them to the charge ; but
                    took two precautions before he began the attack : the firſt was, to ride through
                    the ranks, and ſhow himſelf to the whole army ; for his horſe having been killed
                    under him in the firſt onſet, a report had been ſpread that he was ſlain : the
                    ſecond was, to change his habit and helmet with Megacles ; for having been known
                    in the engagement of the horſe by the richneſs of his attire and armour, many of
                    the Romans had aimed at him in particular, ſo that he was with the utmoſt
                    difficulty taken and ſaved, after his horſe had been killed under him. Thus
                    diſguiſed, he led his phalanx againſt the Roman legions, and attacked them with
                    incredible fury. Lævinus ſuſtained the ſhock with great reſolution, ſo that the
                    victory was ſor many hours warmly diſputed. The Romans gave ſeveral times way to
                    the Epirots, and the Epirots to the Romans ; but both parties rallied again, and
                    were brought back to the charge by their commanders. Megacles, in the attire and
                    helmet of Pyrrhus, was in all places, and well ſupported the character he had
                    aſſumed. But his diſguiſe at laſt proved fatal to him : ſor a Roman knight, by
                    name <hi rend="italic">Dexter,</hi> taking him for the king, followed him
                    wherever he went ; and having found an opportunity of ditcharging a blow at him,
                    ſtruck him dead on the ſpot, ſtripped him of his helmet and armour, and carried
                    them in triumph to the conſul, who, by ſhowing to the Epirots the ſpoils of
                    their king, ſo terrified them, that they began to give ground. But Pyrrhus,
                    appearing bare-headed in the firſt files of his phalanx, and riding through all
                    the lines, undeceived his men, and. inſpired them with new courage.</p>
                <p>The advantage ſeemed to be pretty equal on both ſides, when Læyinus ordered his
                    cavalry to advance ; which Pyrrhus obſerving, drew up 20 elephants in the front
                    of his army, with towers on their backs full of bowmen. The very fight of thoſe
                    dreadful animals chilled the bravery of the Romans, who had never before ſeen
                    any. However, they ſtill advanced, till their horſes, not being able to bear the
                    ſmell of them, and</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0365" facs="gri_33125011196389_0371.tif"/>
                <p>frightened at the ſtrange noiſe they made, either threw their riders, or carried
                    them on full ſpeed in ſpite of their utmoſt efforts. In the mean time, the
                    archers, diſeharging ſhowers of darts from the towers, wounded ſeveral of the
                    Romans in that confuſion, while others were trod to death by the elephants.
                    Notwithſtanding the diſorder of the cavalry, the legionaries ſtill kept their
                    ranks, and could not be broken, till Pyrrhus attacked them in perſon at the head
                    of the Theſſalian horſe. The onſet was ſo furious, that they were' forced to
                    yield, and retire in diſorder. The king of Epirus reſtrained the ardour of his
                    troops, and would not ſuffer them to purſeie the enemy ; an elephant, which had
                    been wounded by a Roman ſoldier named <hi rend="italic">Minucius,</hi> having
                    cauſed a great diſorder in his army, this accident favoured the retreat of the
                    Romans, and gave them time to repaſs the river, and take refuge in Apulia. The
                    Epirot remained maſter of the field, and had the pleaſure to ſee the Romans fly
                    before him : but the victory coſt him dear, a great number of his beſt officers
                    and ſoldiers having been ſlain in the battle ; whence he was heard to ſay after
                    the action, that he was both conqueror and conquered, and that if he gained ſuch
                    another victory, lie ſhould be obliged to return to Epirus alone.</p>
                <p>His firſt care after the action was to bury the dead, with which the plain was
                    covered ; and herein he ιn⅜c no diſtinction between the Romans and his own
                    Epirots. In viewing the bodies of the former, he obſerved, that none of them had
                    received diſhonourable wounds ; that they had all fallen in the polls aſſigned
                    them, ſtill held their ſwords in their hands, and ſhowed, even after death, a
                    certain martial air and ſierce-neſs in their faces ; and on this occaſion it was
                    that he uttered thoſe famous words : “ O that Pyrrhus had the Romans for his
                    ſoldiers, or the Romans Pyrrhus ſor their leader ! together, we ſhould ſubdue
                    the whole world.”</p>
                <p>The king of Epirus underſtood the art of war too well not to reap what advantage
                    he could from his victory. He broke into the countries in alliance with the
                    Romans, plundered the lands of the republic, and made incurſions even into the
                    neighbourhood of Rome. Many cities opened their gates to him, and in a ſhort
                    time he made himſelf maſter of the greateſt part of Campania. While he was in
                    that fruitful province, ſubſiſting his troops there at the expence of the
                    Romans, he was joined by the Samnites, Lucanians, and Meſſapians, whom he had ſo
                    long expected. After having reproached them ſor their delay, he gave them a good
                    ſhare of the ſpoils he had taken from the enemy ; and having by this means
                    gained their affections, he marched without loſs of time to lay ſiege to Capua :
                    but Lævinus, having already received a reinforcement of two legions, threw ſome
                    troops into the city ; which obliged Pyrrhus to drop his deſign, and, leaving
                    Capua, to march ſtraight to Naples Lævinus followed him, ha raffing his troops
                    on their march ; and at length, by keeping his army in the neighbourhood, forced
                    him to give over all thoughts of making himſelf maſter of that important city.
                    The king then, all on a ſudden, took his route towards Rome by the Latin way,
                    ſurpriſed Fregellæ, and, marching through the country of the Hernici, ſat down
                    before Piænefte. There, from the top of an hill, he had the pleaſure of ſeeing
                    Rome j and is ſaid to have advanced ſo near the walls, that he drove a cloud of
                    duſt into the city. But he was ſoon forced to retire by the other conſul T.
                    Coruncanius, who, having reduced Hetruria, was juſt then returned with his
                    victorious army to Rome. The king of Epirus, therefore, having no hopes of
                    bringing the Hetrurians into his intereſt, and ſeeing two conſular armies ready
                    to fall upon him, raiſed the ſiege of Præneite, and haſtened back into Campania
                    ; where, to his great ſurpriſe, lie found Lævinus with a more numerous army than
                    that which he had defeated on the banks of the Siris. The conſul went to meet
                    him, with a deſign to try the fate of another battle ; which Pyrrhus being
                    unwilling to decline, drew up his army, and, to ſtrike terror into the Roman
                    legions, ordered his men to beat their bucklers with their lances, and the
                    leaders of the elephants to force them to make a hideous noiſe. But the noiſe
                    was returned with ſuch an univerſal ſhout by the Romans, that Pyrrhus, thinking
                    ſo much alacrity on the part of the vanquiſhed too ſure a prognoſtic of victory,
                    altered his mind ; and, pretending that the auguries were not favourable,
                    retired to Tarentum, and put an end to the campaign.</p>
                <p>While Pyrrhus continued quiet at Tarentum, he had time to reflect on the valour
                    and conduct of the Romans ; which made him conclude, that the war in which he
                    was engaged muſt end in his ruin and diſgrace, if not terminated by an
                    advantageous peace. He was therefore overjoyed when he heard that the ſenate had
                    determined to ſend an honourable embaſſy to him, not doubting but their errand'
                    was to propoſe terms of peace. The ambaſſadors were three men of diſtinguiſhed
                    merit ; to wit, Cornelius Dolabella, who was famous for the ſignal victory he
                    had gained over the Senones, Fabrſeius, and Æmilius Pappus, who had been his
                    colleague in the conſulate two years before. When they were admitted to an
                    audience, the only thing they iſemanded was a ſurrender of the priſoners, either
                    by the way of exchange, or at ſuch a ranſom as ſhould be agreed on ; ſor
                    Pyrrhus, in the late battle, had made 1800 priſoners, moſt of them Roman knights
                    and men of diſtinction in the republic. They had ſought with great bravery, till
                    their horſes, frightened with the roaring of the king’s elephants, had either
                    thrown them, or obliged them to diſmount ; by which unforeſeen accident they had
                    fallen into the enemy’s hands. The ſenate, therefore, pitying the condition of
                    thoſe brave men, had determined, contrary to their cuſtom, to redeem them.
                    Pyrrhus was greatly ſurpriſed and diſappointed when he found that they had no
                    other propoſals to make ; but, concealing his thoughts, he only anſwered, that
                    he would, conſider of it, and let them know his reſolution. Accordingly, he
                    aſſembled his council : but his chief <hi rend="italic">favourites</hi> were
                    divided in their opinions. Milo, who commanded in the citadel of Tarentum, was
                    ſor coming to no compoſition with the Romans ; but Cy-neas, who knew his
                    matter’s inclination, propoſed not only ſending back the priſoners without
                    ranſem, but diipatching an embaſſy to Rome to treat with the ſenate of a laſting
                    peace. His advice was approved, and he himſelf appointed to go on that embaſſy.
                    After theſe reſolutions, the king acquainted the ambaſſadors, that he intended
                    to releaſe the priſoners without ranſom, ſince he had already riches enough, and
                    de-</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0366" facs="gri_33125011196389_0372.tif"/>
                <p>fired nothing of the republic but her friendſhip. Afterwards he had ſeveral
                    conferences with Fabric!us, whoſe virtue he had tried with mighty offers of
                    riches and grandeur ; but finding him proof againſt ail temptations, he reſolved
                    to try whether his intrepidity and courage were equal to his virtue. With this
                    view, he cauſed an elephant to be placed behind a curtain ih the halΓwhere he
                    received the Roman ambaſſador. As Fa-bricius had never ſeen one of thoſe beaſts,
                    the king, taking a turn or two in the hall with him, brought him within the
                    elephant’s reach, and then cauſed the curtain to be drawn all on a ſudden, and
                    that monſtrous animal to make his uſual noiſe, and even lay his trunk on
                    Fabricius’s head. But thé intrepid Roman, without betraying the leaſt fear or
                    concern, “ Does the great king (laid he, with ſurpriſing calmneſs), who could
                    not ſtagger me with his offers, think to frighten me with the braying of a beaſt
                    ?” Pyrrhus, aſtoniſhed at his immoveable conſtancy, invited him to dine with him
                    ; and on this occaſion it was, that the converſation turning upon Epicurean
                    philoſophy, Fabrſeius made that celebrated exclamation, “ O that Pyrrhus, both
                    for Rome’s ſake and his own, had placed his happineſs in the boaſted indolence
                    of Epicurus.”</p>
                <p>Every thing Pyrrhus heard or ſaw of the Romans increaſed his earneſtneſs for
                    peace. He ſent for the three ambaſſadors, releaſed 200 of the priſoners without
                    ranſom, and ſuffered the reſt, on their parole, to return to Rome to celebrate
                    the Saturnalia, or feaſts of Saturn, in their own families. Having by this
                    obliging behaviour gained the good-will of the Roman ambaſſadors, he ſent Cyneas
                    to Rome, almoſt at the ſame time that they left Tarentum. The inſtructions he
                    gave this faithful miniſter, were, to bring the Romans to grant theſe three
                    articles ; 1. That the Tarentines ſhould be included in the treaty made with the
                    king of Epirus. 2. That the Greek cities in Italy ſhould be ſuffered to enjoy
                    their laws and liberties. 3. That the republic ſhould reſtore to the Samnites,
                    Lucanians, and BrUttians, all the places ſhe had taken from them. Upon theſe
                    conditions, Pyrrhus declared himſelf ready to forbear all further hoſtilities,
                    and conclude a laſting peace. With theſe inſtructions Cyneas ſet out for Rome }
                    where, partly by his eloquence, partly by rich preſents to the ſenators and
                    their wives, he ſoon gained a good number of voices. When he was admitted into
                    the ſenate, he made an harangue worthy of a diſciple of the great Demoſt-henes ;
                    after which, he read the conditions Pyrrhus propoſed, and, with a great deal of
                    eloquence, endeavouring to ſhow the reaſonableneſs and moderation of his
                    mailer’s demands, aſhed leave ſor Pyrrhus to come to Rome to conclude and ſign
                    the treaty. The ſenators were generally inclined to agree to Pyrrhus’s terms ;
                    but nevertheleſs, as ſeveral ſenators were abſent, the determination of the
                    affair was poſtponed to the next day ; when Appius Claudius, the greateſt orator
                    and moſt learned civilian in Rome, old and blind as he was, cauſed himſelf to be
                    carried to the ſenate, where he had not appeared for many years ; and there,
                    partly by his eloquence, partly by his authority, ſo prepoſſeſſed the minds of
                    the ſenators againſt the king of Epirus, and the conditions he offered, that,
                    when he had done ſpeaking, the conſcript fathers unanimouſiy paſſed a decree,
                    the ſubſtance of which was, That the war with Pyrrhus ſhould be continued ; that
                    his ambaſtador ſhould be ſent back that very day ; that the king of Epirus
                    ſhould not be permitted to come to Rome ; and that they ſhould acquaint his
                    ambaſſador, that Rome would enter into no treaty of peace with his maſter till
                    lie had left Italy.</p>
                <p>Cyneas, ſurpriſed at the anſwer given him, left Rome the ſaftie day, and
                    returned to Tarentum, to acquaint the king with the final reſolution of the
                    ſenate. Pyrrhus Would have willingly concluded a peace with them upon honourable
                    terms ; but, as the conditions they offered were not by any means conſiſtent
                    with the reputation of his arms, he began, without loſs of time, to make all due
                    preparations for the next campaign. On the other hand, the Romans having raiſed
                    to the conſulate P. Sulpſeius 8averrio, and P. Decius Mus, diſpatched them both
                    into Apulia, where they found Pyrrhus encamped near a little town called <hi
                        rend="italic"> Aſculum.</hi> There the conſuls, joining their armies,
                    fortified themſelves at the foot of the Apennines, having between them and the
                    enemy a large deep ſtream which divided the plain. Both armies continued a great
                    while on the oppoſite banks, before either ventured to paſs over to attack the
                    Other. The Epirots allowed the Romans to croſs the ſtream, and draw up on the
                    plain. On the other hand, Pyrrhus placed his men likewiſe in order of battle in
                    the ſame plain ; and all the ancients do him the juſtice to ſay, that no
                    commander ever underſtood better the art of drawing up an army and directing its
                    motions. In the right wing he placed his Epirots and the Samnites ; in his left
                    the Lucanians, Bruttians and Salentines ; and liis phalanx in the centre. The
                    centre of the Roman army conſiſted of four legions, which were to engage the
                    enemy’s phalanx ; on their wings were poſted the light-armed auxiliaries and the
                    Roman horſe. The conſuls, in order to guard their troops againſt the fury of the
                    elephants had prepared chariots, armed with long points of iron in the ſhape of
                    forks, and filled with ſoldiers carrying firebrands, which they were directed to
                    throw at the elephants, and by that means frighten them, and ſet their wooden
                    towers on fire. Theſe chariots were poſted over-againſt the king’s elephants,
                    and ordered not to ſtir till they entered upon action. To this precaution the
                    Roman generals added another, which was, to direct a body of Apulians to attack
                    Pyrthus’s camp in the heat of the engagement, in order to force it, or at leaſt
                    to draw off part of the enemy’s troops to defend it. At length the attack began,
                    both parties being pretty equal in number ; for each of them conſiſted of about
                    40,000 men. The phalanx ſuſtained, for a long time, the furious onſet of the
                    legions with incredible bravery : but at length being forced to give way,
                    Pyrrhus commanded his elephants to advance, but not on the ſide where the Romans
                    had poſted their chariots ; they marched round, and, falling upon the Roman
                    horſe, ſoon put them into confuſion. Then the phalanx, returning with freſh
                    courage to the charge, made the Roman legions in their turn give ground. On this
                    occaſion Decius was killed, ſo that one conſul only was leſt to command the two
                    Roman armies. But while all things ſeemed to favour Pyrrhus, the body of
                    Apulians which we have mentioned above, falling unexpectedly on the camp of the
                    Epirots, obliged the king to di-ſpatch a ſtrong detachment to defend his
                    intrenchments.</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0367" facs="gri_33125011196389_0373.tif"/>
                <p>Upon the departure of theſe troops, ſome of the Epirots, imagining that the camp
                    was taken, began to loſe courage, and retire ; thoſe who were next to them
                    followed their example, and in a ſhort time the whole army gave way. Pyrrhus
                    having attempted ſeveral times in vain to rally his forces, returned to the
                    charge with a ſmall number of his friends and the moſt courageous of his
                    officers. With theſe he ſuſtained the fury of the victorious legions, and
                    covered the retreat of his own men. But being, after a moſt gallant behaviour,
                    dan-gerouſly wounded, he retired at laſt with his ſmall band in good order,
                    leaving the Romans maſters of the field. As the ſun was near ſetting, the
                    Romans, being extremely fatigued, and a great number of them wounded, the conſul
                    Sulpicius, not thinking it adviſable to purſue the enemy, founded a retreat,
                    repaſſed the ſtream, and brought his troops back to the camp. Sulpicius appeared
                    in the field of battle the next day, with a deſign to bring the Epirots to a
                    ſecond engagement ; but finding they had withdrawn in the night to Tarentum, he
                    likewiſe retired, and put his troops into winter-quarters in Apulia.</p>
                <p>Both armies continued quiet in their quarters during winter ; but early in the
                    ſpring took the field anew.— The Romans were commanded this year by two men of
                    great ſame, whom they had raiſed to the conſulate the ſecond time : theſe were
                    the celebrated C. Fabri-cius and Æmilius Pappus ; who no ſooner arrived in
                    Apulia, than they led their troops into the territory of Tarentum. Pyrrhus, who
                    had received conſiderable reinforcements from Epirus, met them near the
                    frontiers, and encamped at a ſmall diſtance from the Roman army. While the
                    conſuls were waiting here for a favourable opportunity to give battle, a
                    meſſenger from Nicias, the king’s phyſician, delivered a letter to Fabri-cius ;
                    wherein the traitor offered to take off his maſter by poifon, provided the
                    conſul would promiſe him a reward proportionable to the greatneſs of the
                    ſervice. The virtuous Roman, being filled with horror at the bare propoſal of
                    ſuch a crime, immediately communicated the affair to his colleague ; who readily
                    joined with him in writing a letter to Pyrrhus, wherein they warned him, without
                    diſcovering the criminal, to take care of himſelf, and be upon his guard againſt
                    the treacherous deſigns of thoſe about him. Pyrrhus, out of a deep ſenſe of
                    gratitude for ſo great a benefit, releaſed immediately, without ranſom, all the
                    priſoners he had taken. But the Romans, diſdaining to accept either a ſavour
                    from an enemy, or a recompenſe for not committing the blackeſt treachery,
                    declared, that they would not receive their priſoners but by way of exchange ;
                    and accordingly ſent to Pyrrhus an equal number of Samnite and Tarentine
                    priſoners.</p>
                <p>As the king of Epirus grew every day more weary oſa war which he feared would
                    end in his diſgrace, he ſent Cyneas a ſecond time to Rome, to try whether he
                    could, with his artful harangues, prevail upon the con-ſeript fathers to hearken
                    to an accommodation, upon ſuch terras as were conſiſtent with his honour.. But
                    the ambaſſador ſound the ſenators ſteady in their former reſolution, and
                    determined not to enter into- a treaty with his maſter till he had left Italy,
                    and withdrawn from thence all his forces. This gave the king great uneaſineſs ;
                    for he· had already loſt moſt of his veteran troops and. beſt officers, and was
                    ſenſible that he ſhould loſe the reſt if he ventured another engagement. While
                    he was revolving theſe melancholy thoughts in his mind, ambaſſadors arrivçd at
                    his camp from the Syra-cuſians, Agrigentines, and I√eontines, imploring the
                    aſſiſtance of his arms to drive out the Carthaginians, and put an end to the
                    troubles which threatened their respective ſtates with utter deſtruction.
                    Pyrrhus, who wanted only ſome honourable pretence to leave Italy, laid hold of
                    this ; and appointing Milo governor of Tarentum, with a ſtrong garriſon to keep
                    the inhabitants in awe during his abſence, he ſet ſail ſor Sicily with 30,000
                    foot and 2500 horſe, on board a fleet of 200 ſhips. Here he was at firſt
                    attended with great ſucceſs ; but the Sicilians, diſguſted at the reſolution he
                    had taken of paſſing over into Africa, and much more at the enormous exactions
                    and extortions of his miniſters and courtiers, had ſubmitted partly to the
                    Carthaginians and partly to the Mamertines. When Carthage heard of this change,
                    new troops were raiſed all over Africa, and a numerous army ſent into Sicily to
                    recover the cities which Pyrrhus had taken. As the Sicilians daily deſerted from
                    him in crowds, he was no way in a condition, with his Epirots alone, to
                    withſtand ſo powerful an enemy ; and therefore, when deputies came to him from
                    the Tarentines, Samnites, Bruttians, and Lucanians, repreſenting to him the
                    loſſes they had ſuſtained ſince his departure, and remonſtrating, that, without
                    his aſſiſtance, they muſt fall a ſacriſice to the Romans, he laid hold of that
                    opportunity to abandon the iſland, and return to Italy. His fleet was attacked
                    by that of Carthage ; and his army, after their landing, by the Mamertines. But
                    Pyrrhus having, by his heroic bravery, eſeaped all danger, marched along the
                    ſea-ſhore, in order to reach Tarentum that way. As he paſſed through the country
                    of the Locrians, who had not long before maſſacred the troops he had left there,
                    he not only exerciſed all ſorts of cruelty on the inhabitants, but plundered the
                    temple of Proſerpine to ſupply the wants of his army. The immenſe riches which
                    he found there, were, by his order, ſent to Tarentum by ſea ; but the ſhips that
                    carried them being daſhed againſt the rocks by a tempeſt, and the mariners all
                    loſt, this proud prince was convinced, ſays Livy, that the gods were not
                    imaginary beings, and cauſed all the treaſure, which the ſea had thrown upon the
                    ſhore, to be carefully gathered up, and replaced in the temple : nay, to appeaſe
                    the wrath of the angry goddeſs, he put all thoſe to death who had adviſed him to
                    plunder her temple. However, ſuperſtition made the ancients aſeribe to this act
                    of impiety all the misfortunes, which , after» wards befel that unhappy prince.</p>
                <p>Pyrrhus at length arrived at Tarentum ; but of the army he had carried into
                    Sicily, he brought back into Italy only 2000 horſe and not· quite 20,000 foot.
                    He therefore reinforced them w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> ith the beſt troops he
                    could raiſe in the countries of'the Samnites, Lucanians, and Bruttians ; and
                    hearing that the two new conſuls, Cu-rius Dentatus and Cornelius. Lentulus, had
                    divided their forces, the one invading Lucania and the other Samnium, he
                    likewiſe divided his army into two bodies, marching, with the choice of his
                    Epirots againſt Dentatus, in hopes of ſurpriſing him in his camp near
                    Be-neventum. But the conſul having notice, of his approach, went out of his
                    intrenchments with a ſtrong detachment of legionaries to meet him ; repulſed his</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0368" facs="gri_33125011196389_0374.tif"/>
                <p>van-guard, put many of the Epirots to the ſword, and took ſome of their
                    elephants. Curius encouraged with this ſucceſs, marched his army into
                    theTauraſian fields, and drew it up in a plain which was wide enough for his
                    troops, but too narrow for the Epirot phalanx, the phalangites being ſo crowded
                    that they could not handle their arms without difficulty. But the king’s
                    eagerneſs to try his ſtrength and ſkill with ſo renowned a com-’ mander, made
                    him engage at that great diſadvantage. Upon the firſt ſignal the action began ;
                    and one of the king’s wings giving way, the victory ſeemed to incline to the
                    Romans. But that wing where the king fought in perſon repulſed the enemy, and
                    drove them back quite to their intrenchments. This advantage was in great part
                    owing to the elephants ; which Curius perceiving, commanded a corps de reſerve,
                    which he had poſted near the camp, to advance and fall upon the elephants. Theſe
                    carrying burning torches in one hand, and their ſwords in the other, threw the
                    former at the elephants, and with the latter defended themſelves againſt their
                    guides ; by which means they were both forced to give way. The elephants being
                    put to flight broke into the phalanx, cloſe as it was, and there cauſed a
                    general diſorder ; which was increaſed by a remarkable accident: for it is ſaid,
                    that a young elephant being wounded, and thereupon making a dreadful noiſe, the
                    mother quitting her rank, and haſtening to the aſſiſtance of her young one, put
                    thoſe who ſtill kept their ranks into the utmoſt confuſion. But, however that
                    be, it is certain that the Romans obtained at laſt a complete victory. Oroſius
                    and Eutropius tell us that Pyrrhus’s army conſiſted of 80,000 foot and 6ooo
                    horſe, including his Epirots and allies ; whereas the conſular army was ſcarce
                    20,000 ſtrong. Thoſe who exaggerate the king’s loſs ſay, that the number of the
                    ſlain on his ſide amounted to 30,000 men ; but others reduce it to 20,000. All
                    writers agree, that Curius took 1200 priſoners and eight elephants. This
                    victory, which was the moſt deciſive Rome had ever gained, brought all Italy
                    under ſubjection, and paved the way for thoſe vaſt conqueſts which afterwards
                    made the Romans maſters of the whole know <hi rend="sup">r</hi> n world.</p>
                <p>Pyrrhus being no way in a condition, after the great loſs he had ſuſtained, to
                    keep the field, retired to Ta-rentuιh <hi rend="sup">,</hi> , attended only by
                    a ſmall body of horſe, leaving the Romans in full poſſeſſion of his camp ; which
                    they ſo much admired, that they made it ever after a model to form theirs by.
                    And now the king of Epirus reſolved to leave Italy as ſoon as poſſible; but
                    concealed his deſign, and endeavoured to keep up the drooping ſpirits of his
                    allies, by giving them hopes of ſpeedy ſuccours from Greece. Accordingly he
                    diſpatched ambaſſadors into Ætolia, Illyricum, and Macedon, demanding ſupplies
                    of men and money. But the anſwers from thoſe courts not proving ſavourable, he
                    forged ſuch as might pleaſe thoſe whom he was willing to deceive ; and by this
                    means ſupported the courage of his friends, and kept his enemy in play. When he
                    could conceal his departure no longer, he pretended to be on a ſudden in a great
                    paſſion at the dilatorineſs of his friends in ſending him ſuccours ; and
                    acquainted the Tarentines, that he muſt go and bring them over himſelf. However,
                    he leſt behind him a ſtrong garriſon in the citadel of Tarentum, under the
                    command of the ſame Milo who had kept it for him during his ſtay in Sicily. In
                    order to keep this governor in his duty, he is ſaid to have made him a very
                    ſtrange preſent, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> a chair covered with the
                    fl&lt;in of Nicias, the treacherous phyſician, who had offered Fabricius to
                    poiſon his ma-' ſter. After all theſe diſguiſes and precautions, Pyrrhus at laſt
                    ſet ſail for Epirus, and arrived ſafe at Acrocerau-nimn with 8000 foot and 500
                    horſe; after having ſpent to no purpoſe ſix years in Italy and Sicily.</p>
                <p>Though, from the manner in which Pyrrhus took his leave, his Italian allies had
                    little reaſon to expect any further aſſiſtance from him, yet they continued to
                    amuſe themſelves with vain hopes, till certain accounts arrived of his being
                    killed at the ſiege of Argos, as has been related under the article Epirus. This
                    threw the Samnites into deſpair : ſo that they put all to the iſſue of a general
                    battle ; in which they were defeated with fιιch dreadful ſlaughter, that the
                    nation is ſaid to have been almoſt exterminated. This overthrow was ſoon
                    followed by the ſubmiſſion of the Lucanians, Bruttians, Tarentines, Sarcinates,
                    Picentes, and Salentines ; ſo that Rome now became miſtreſs of all the nations
                    from the remoteſt parts of Hetruria to the Ionian ſea, and from the Tyrrhenian
                    ſea to the Adriatic. All theſe nations, however, did not enjoy the ſame
                    privileges. Some were entirely ſubject to the republic, and had no laws but what
                    they received from thence ; others retained their old laws and cuſtoms, but in
                    ſubjection to the republic : ſome were tributary; and others allies, who were
                    obliged to furniſh troops at their own expence when the Romans required. Some
                    had the privilege of Roman citizenſhip, their ſoldiers being incorporated in the
                    legions; while others had a right of ſuffrage in the elections made by the
                    centuries. Theſe different degrees of honour, privileges, and liberty, were
                    founded on the different terms granted to the conquered nations when they
                    ſurrendered, and were afterwards increaſed according to their fidelity and the
                    ſervices they did the republic.</p>
                <p>The Romans now became reſpected by foreign nations, and received ambaſſadors
                    from Ptolemy Philadel-phus king of Egypt, and from Apollonia a city of Macedon.
                    Senſible of their own importance, they now granted protection to whatever nation
                    requeſted it of them ; but this not with a view of ſerving one party, but that
                    they might have an opportunity of ſubjecting both. In this manner they aſſiſted
                    the Mamertines againſt Hiero king of Syracuſe, which brought on the wars with
                    the Carthaginians, which terminated in the total deſtruction of that ancient
                    republic, as has been related under the article Carthage. The interval between
                    the firſt and ſecond Punic wars was by the Romans employed in reducing the Boii
                    and Ligurians, who had revolted. Theſe were Gauliſh nations, who had always been
                    very formidable to the Romans, and now gave one of their conſuls a notable
                    defeat. However, he ſoon after ſufficiently revenged himſelf, and defeated the
                    enemy with great ſlaughter ; though it was not till ſome time after, and with a
                    good deal of difficulty, that they were totally ſubdued. During this interval
                    alſo, the Romans ſeized on the iſlands of Sardinia, Corſica, and Malta ; and in
                    the year 219 B. C. the two former were reduced to the form of a province.
                    Papirius, who had ſubdued Corſica, demanded a triumph ; but not having intereſt
                    enough to obtain it, he took a method entirely new to do himſelf juſtice. He put</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0369" facs="gri_33125011196389_0375.tif"/>
                <p>himſelf at the head of his victorious army, and marched to the temple of Jupiter
                    Latialis, on the hill of Alba, with all the pomp that attended triumphant
                    victors at Rome. He made no other alteration in the ceremony, but that of
                    wearing a crown of myrtle inſtead of a crown of laurel, and this on account of
                    his having defeated the Corſicans in a place where there was a grove of myrtles.
                    The example of Papirius was afterwards followed by a great many generals to whom
                    the ſenate refuſed triumphs.</p>
                <p>The next year, when M. Æmilius Barbula and M. Junius Pera were conſuls, a new
                    war ſprung up in a kingdom out of Italy. <hi rend="italic">Illyricum,</hi> properly ſo called, which bordered upon Macedon and Epirus, was at this time
                    governed by a woman named <hi rend="italic">Teuta,</hi> the widow of king
                    Agron, and guardian to her ſon Pinεeus, who was under age. The ſucceſs of her
                    late huſhand againſt the Ætolians had fluſhed her to ſuch a degree, that,
                    inſtead of ſettling the affairs of her ward in peace, ſhe commanded her ſubjects
                    to cruiſe along the coaſt, ſeize all the ſhips they met, take what places they
                    could, and ſpare no nation. Her pirates had, purſuant to her orders, taken and
                    plundered many ſhips belonging to the Roman merchants ; and her troops were then
                    beſieging the iſland of IfΓa in the Adriatic, though the inhabitants had put
                    themſelves under the protection of the republic. Upon the complaints therefore
                    of the Italian merchants, and to protect the people of Iſſa, the ſenate ſent two
                    ambaſſadors to the Illyrian queen, Lucius and Caius Coruncanus, to demand of her
                    that ſhe would reſtrain her ſubjects from infeſting the ſea with pirates. She
                    anſwered them haughtily, that ſhe could only promiſe that her ſubjects ſhould
                    not for the future attack the Romans in her name, and by public authority : “
                    but as for any thing more, it is not cuſtomary with us (ſaid ſhe) to lay
                    reſtraints on our ſubjects, nor will we forbid them to reap thoſe advantages
                    from the ſea which it offers them.” Your cuſtoms then (replied the young-eſt of
                    the ambaſſadors) are very different from ours. At Rome we make public examples
                    of thoſe ſubjects who injure others, whether at home or abroad. Teuta, we can,
                    by our arms, force you to reform the abuſes of your bad government.” Theſe
                    unſeaſonable threaten-ings provoked Teuta, who was naturally a proud and
                    imperious woman, to ſuch a degree, that, without regard to the right of nations,
                    ſhe cauſed the ambaſſadors to be murdered on their return home.</p>
                <p>When ſo notorious an infraction of the law of na-tions <hi rend="sub">ι</hi> was known at Rome, the people demanded vengeance; and the ſenate having firſt
                    honoured the manes of the ambaſſadors, by erecting, as was uſual in ſuch caſes,
                    ſtatues three feet high to their memory, ordered a fleet to be equipped, and
                    troops raiſed, with all poſſible expedition. But now Teuta, reflecting on the
                    enormity of her proceedings, ſent an embaſſy to Rome, aſſuring the ſenate that
                    ſhe had no hand in the murder of the ambaſſadors, and offering to deliver up to
                    the republic thoſe who had committed that barbarous aſ-ſaſſination. The Romans
                    being at that time threatened with a war from the Gauls, were ready to accept
                    this ſatisfaction : but in the mean time the Illyrian fleet having gained ſome
                    advantage over that of the Achæ-ans, and taken the iſland of Corcyra near
                    Epirus, this ſucceſs made Teuta believe herſelf invincible, and forget the
                    promiſe ſhe had made to the Romans ; nay, ſhe ſent her fleet to ſeize on the
                    iſland of Iſſa, which the Romans had taken under their protection.</p>
                <p>Hereupon the conſuls for the new year, P. Poſthumius Albinus and Cn. Fulvius
                    Centumalus, embarked for Illyricum; Fulvius having the command of the fleet,
                    which conſiſted of ιoo galleys; and Poſthumius of the land forces, which
                    amounted to 20,000 foot, beſides a ſmall body of horſe. Fulvius appeared with
                    his fleet before Corcyra in the Adriatic, and was put in poſſeſſion both of the
                    iſland and city by Demetrius of Pharos, governor of the place for Queen Teuta.
                    Nor was this all ; Demetrius found means to make the inhabitants of Apollonia
                    drive out the Illyrian garriſon, and admit into their city the Roman troops. As
                    Apollonia was one of the keys of Illyricum on the ſide of Macedon» the conſuls,
                    who had hitherto acted jointly, no ſooner ſaw themſelves in poſſeſſion of it
                    than they ſeparated, the fleet cruiſing along the coaſt, and the army
                    penetrating into the heart of the queen’s dominions. The Andyœans, Parthini, and
                    Atintanes, voluntarily ſubmitted to Poſthumius, being induced by the perſuaſions
                    of Demetrius to ſhake off the Illyrian yoke. The conſul being now in poſſeſſion
                    of moſt of the inland towns, returned to the coaſt, where, with the aſſiſtance
                    of the fleet, he took many ſtrong holds, among which was Nutria, a place of
                    great ſtrength, and defended by a numerous garriſon ; ſo that it made a vigorous
                    defence, the Romans having loſt before it a great many private men, ſeveral
                    legionary tribunes, and one quæftor. However, this loſs was repaired by the
                    taking of 40 Illyrian veſſels, which were returning home laden with booty. At
                    length the Roman fleet appeared before Iſſa, which, by Teuta’s order, was ſtill
                    cloſely beſieged, notwithſtanding the loſſes ſhe had ſuſtained. However, upon
                    the approach of the Roman fleet, the Illyrians diſperſed ; but the Pharians, who
                    ſerved among them, followed the example of their countryman Demetrius, and
                    joined the Romans, to whom the Iſſani readily ſubmitted.</p>
                <p>In the mean time Sp. Corvilius and Q. Fabius Maximus being raiſed to the
                    conſulate a ſecond time, Poſthumius w-as recalled from Illyricum, and refuſed a
                    triumph for having been too prodigal of the Roman blood at the ſiege of Nutria.
                    . His colleague Fulvius was appointed to command the land forces in his room, in
                    quality of proconſul. Hereupon Teuta, who had founded great hopes on the change
                    of the conſuls, retired to one of her ſtrong-holds called <hi rend="italic">Rl&gt;ixon,</hi> and from thence early in the ſpring ſent an embaſſy to
                    Rome. The ſenate reſuſed to treat with her ; but granted the young king a peace
                    upon the following conditions : 1. That he ſhould pay an annual tribute to the
                    republic. 2. That he ſhould ſurrender part of his dominions to the Romans. 3.
                    That he ſhould never ſuffer above three of his ſhips of war at a time to ſail
                    beyond Lyſſus, a town on the confines of Macedon and Illyricum. The places he
                    yielded to the Romans in virtue of this treaty, were the iſlands of Corcyra,
                    Iffa, and Pharos, the city of Dyrrhachium, and the country of the Atintanes.
                    Soon after Teuta, either out of ſhame, or compelled by a ſecret article of the
                    treaty, abdicated the regency, and Demetrius ſucceeded her.</p>
                <p>Before this war was ended, the Romans were alarmed by new motions of the Gauls,
                    and the great progreſs which the Carthaginians made in Spain. At this time</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0370" facs="gri_33125011196389_0376.tif"/>
                <p>alſo the fears of the people were excited by a prophecy ſaid to be taken out of
                    the Sybilline books, that the Gauls and Greeks ſhould one day be in poſſeſſion
                    of Rome. This prophecy, however, the ſenate found means to elude, as they
                    pretended, by burying two Gauls and two Greeks alive, and then telling the
                    multitude that the Gauls and Greeks were now in the poſſeſſion of Rome. The
                    difficulties which ſuperſtition had raiſed being thus ſurmounted, the Romans
                    made vaſt preparations againſt the Gauls, whom they ſeem to have dreaded above
                    all other nations. Some ſay that the number of forces raiſed by the Romans on
                    this occaſion amounted to no fewer than 8oo,ooc men. Of this incredible
                    multitude 248,000 foot and 26,000 horſe were Romans or Campanians ;
                    nevertheleſs, the Gauls, with only &lt;fo,ooo foot and 20,000 horſe, forced
                    a paſſage through Hetruria, and took the road towards Rome. Here they had the
                    good fortune at firſt to defeat one of the Roman armies; but being ſoon after
                    met by two others, they were utterly defeated, with the loſs of more than 50,0co
                    of their number. The Romans then entered their country, which they cruelly
                    ravaged ; but a plague breaking out in their army, obliged them to return home.
                    This was followed by a new war, in which thoſe Gauls who inhabited Inſubria and
                    Liguria were totally ſubdued, and their country reduced to a Roman province.
                    Theſe conqueſts were followed by that of Iſtria ; Dimalum, a city of importance
                    in Illyricum ; and Pharos, an iſland in the Adriatic ſea.</p>
                <p>The ſecond Punic war for ſome time retarded the conqueſts of the Romans, and
                    even threatened their ſtate with entire deſtruction ; but Hannibal being at laſt
                    recalled from Italy, and entirely defeated at Zama, they made peace upon ſuch
                    advantageous terms as gave them an entire ſuperiority over that republic, which
                    they not long after entirely ſubverted, as has been related in the hiſtory of <hi rend="smallcaps">Carthage.</hi></p>
                <p>The ſucceſsful iſſue of the ſecond Punic war had greatly increaſed the extent of
                    the Roman empire. They were now maſters of all Sicily, the Mediterranean
                    iſlands, and great part of Spain ; and, through the diſſenſions of the Aſiatic
                    ſtates with the king of Macedon, a pretence was now found for carrying their
                    arms into theſe parts. The Gauls in the mean time, however, continued their
                    incurſions, but now ceaſed to be formidable ; while the kings of Macedon,
                    through miſconduct, were firſt obliged to ſubmit to a disadvantageous peace,
                    and' at laſt totally ſubdued (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Macedon).</hi> The
                    reduction of Macedon was ſoon followed by that of all Greece, either by the name
                    of allies or otherwiſe : while Antiochus the Great, to whom Hannibal fled for
                    protection, by an unſucceſsful war firſt gave the Romans a footing in Aſia (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Syria).</hi> The Spaniards and Gauls continued to be
                    the moſt obſtinate enemies. The former, particularly, were rather exterminated
                    than reduced ; and even this required the ut∙ moſt care and vigilance of Scipio
                    Æmilianus; the conqueror of Garthage, to execute. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Spain</hi> and Nc <hi rend="sup">τ</hi> -MANTIA.</p>
                <p>Thus the Romans attained to a height of power fu-τ&gt;erior to any other
                    nation in the world ; bfιt now a ſedition broke out, which we may ſay was never
                    terminated but with the overthrow of the republic. This had its origin from
                    Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, deſcen-ded from a family which» though plebeian,
                    was as illu^</p>
                <p>ſtrious as any in the commonwealth. His father had been twice raiſed to the
                    conſulate, was a great general, and had been honoured with two triumphs. But he
                    was ſtill more renowned for his domeſtic virtues and pro· bity, than for his
                    birth or valour. He married the daughter of the firſt Africanus, ſaid to be the
                    pattern of her ſex, and the prodigy of her age ; and had by her ſeveral
                    children, of whom three only arrived to maturity of age, Tiberius Gracchus,
                    Caius Gracchus, and a daughter named <hi rend="italic">Sempronia,</hi> who was
                    married to the ſecond Africanus. Tiberius, the eldeſt, was deemed the moſt
                    accompliſhed youth in Rome, with reſpect to the qualities both of body and mind.
                    His extraordina∙ ry talents were heightened by a noble air, an engaging
                    countenance, and all thoſe winning graces of nature which recommend merit. He
                    made his firſt campaigns under his brother-in-law, and diſtinguiſhed himſelf on
                    all occaſions h,y his courage, and by the prudence of his conduct. When he
                    returned to Rome, he applied himſelf to the ſtudy of eloquence ; and at 30 years
                    old was accounted the beſt orator of his age. He married the daughter of Appius
                    Claudius, who had been formerly conſul and cenſor, and was then prince of the
                    ſenate. He continued for ſome time in the ſentiments both of his own and his
                    wife’s family, and ſupported the intereſts of the patricians ; but without
                    openly attacking the popular faction. He was the chief author and negociator of
                    that ſhameful neceſſary peace with the Numantines ; which the ſenate, with the
                    utmoſt injuſtice, diſannulled, and condemned the conſul, the quæftor, and all
                    the officers who had ſigned it, to be delivered up to the Numantines (ſee Nu <hi
                        rend="smallcaps"> manti a).</hi> The people indeed, out of eſteem for
                    Gracchus, would not ſuffer him to be ſacrificed : but, however, he had juſt
                    reaſon to complain, both of the ſenate and people, for paſſing ſo ſcandalous a
                    decree againſt his general and himſelf, and breaking a treaty whereby the lives
                    of ſo many citizens had been ſaved. But as the ſenate</p>
                <p>had chiefly promoted ſuch baſe and iniquitous proceedings, he reſolved in due
                    time to ſhow his refent-ment againſt the party which had contributed moſt to his
                    diſgrace.</p>
                <p>In order to this, he ſtood for the tribuneſhip of the people ; which he no
                    ſooner obtained, than he reſolved to attack the nobility in the moſt tender
                    part. They had uſurped lands unjuſtly ; cultivated them by ſlaves, to the great
                    detriment of the public ; and had lived for about 250 years in open defiance to
                    the Licinian law, by which it was enacted that no citizen ſhould poſſeſs more
                    than 500 acres. This law Tib. Gracchus reſoL ved to revive, and by that means
                    revenge himſelf on the patricians. But it was not revenge alone which prompted
                    him to embark in ſo dangerous an attempt, It is pretended, that his mother
                    Cornelia animated him to undertake ſomething worthy both of his and her family.
                    The reproaches of his mother, the authority of ſome great men, namely of his
                    father-in-law Appius Claudius,, of P. Craſſns the <hi rend="italic">pontifex
                        maximus,</hi> and of Mutius Scævola, the moſt learned civilian in Rome, and
                    his natural thrift after glory, joined with an eager deſire of revenge,
                    conſpired to draw him into this moſt unfortunate ſeheme.</p>
                <p>The law, as he firſt drew it up, was very mild : for it only enacted, that thoſe
                    who poſſeſſed more than çoo acres of land ſhould part with the overplus ; and
                    that</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0371" facs="gri_33125011196389_0377.tif"/>
                <p>the Full value of the ſaid lands ſhould be paid them out of the public treaſury.
                    The lands thus purchaſed by the public were to be divided among the poor
                    oitizens; and cultivated either by themſelves or by freemen, who were upon the
                    ſpot. Tiberius allowed every child of a family to hold 250 acres in his own
                    name, over and above what was allowed to the father. Nothing could be more mild
                    than this new law ; ſince by the Licinian he might have abſolutely deprived the
                    rich of the lands they unjuſtly poſſeſſed, and made them accountable for the
                    profits they had received from them during their long poſſeſſion. But the rich
                    patricians could not ſo much as bear the name of the <hi rend="italic">Licinian
                        law,</hi> though thus qualified. Thoſe chiefly of the ſenatorial and
                    equeſtrian order exclaimed againſt it, and were continually mounting the roſtra
                    one after another, in order to diſe ſuade the people from accepting a law which,
                    they ſaid, would raiſe diſturbances, that might prove more dangerous than the
                    evils which Tiberius pretended to redreſs by the promulgation of it. Thus the
                    zealous tribune was obliged day after day to enter the lifts with freſh
                    adverſaries ; but he ever got the better of them both in point of eloquence and
                    argument.</p>
                <p>The people were charmed to hear him maintain the cauſe of the unfortunate with
                    ſo much ſucceſs, and beſtowed on him the higheſt commendations. The rich
                    therefore had recourſe to violence and calumny, in order to deſtroy, or at leaſt
                    to diſcredit, the tribune. It is ſaid they hired aſſaſſins to diſpatch him ; but
                    they could not put their wicked deſign in execution, Gracchus being always
                    attended to and from the roſtra by a guard of about 4000 men. His adverſaries
                    therefore endeavoured to ruin his reputation by the blackeſt calumnies. They
                    gave out that be aimed at monarchy ; and publiſhed pretended plots laid for
                    crowning him king. But the people, without giving ear to ſuch groundleſs
                    reports, made it their whole buſineſs to encourage their tribune, who was
                    hazarding both his life and reputation for their fakes.</p>
                <p>When the day came on which this law was to be accepted or rejected by the people
                    aſſembled in the co-mitium, Gracchus began with haranguing the mighty croud
                    which an affair of ſuch importance had brought together both from the city and
                    country. In his ſpeech he ſhowed the juſtice of the law with ſo much eloquence,
                    made ſo moving a deſcription of the miſeries of the meaner ſort of people, and
                    at the ſame time ſet forth in ſuch odious colours the uſurpation of the public
                    lands, and the immenſe riches which the avarice and rapaciouſneſs of the great
                    had raked together, that the people, tranſported with fury, demanded with loud
                    cries the billets, that they might give their ſuffrages. Then Gracchus, finding
                    the minds of the citizens in that warmth and emotion which was neceſſary for the
                    ſucceſs of his deſign, ordered the law to be read.</p>
                <p>But unluckily one of the tribunes, by name <hi rend="italic">Marcus 03avius
                        Cacina,</hi> who had always profeſſed a great friendſhip for Gracchus,
                    having been gained over by the patricians, declared againſt the proceedings of
                    his friend and colleague ; and pronounced the word which had been always awful
                    in the mouth of a tribune of the people, <hi rend="italic">Veto,</hi> “ I
                    forbid it.” As Octavius was a man of an unblameable character, and had hitherto
                    been very zealous ſor the publication” of the law, Gracchus waε greatly
                    ſurpriſed at this unexpected oppoſition ſrom Ids friend. However, he kept his
                    temper, and only deſired the people to aſſemble again the next day to hear their
                    two tribunes, one in defence of, the other in oppoſition to, the law propoſed.
                    The people met at the time appointed ; when Gracchus addreſſing himſelf to his
                    colleague, conjured him by the mutual duties of their function, and by the bonds
                    of their ancient friendſhip, not to oppoſe the good of the people, whom they
                    were bound in honour to protect againſt the uſurpation of the great : nay,
                    taking his colleague aſide, he addreſ-ſed him thus, “ Perhaps you are perſonally
                    concerned to oppoſe this law ; if ſo, I mean, if you have more than the five
                    hundred acres, I myſelf, poor as I am, engage to pay you in money what you will
                    loſe in land.” But Octavius, either out of ſhame, or from a principle of honour,
                    continued immoveable in the party he had embraced.</p>
                <p>Gracchus therefore had recourſe to another expedient ; which was to ſuſpend all
                    the magiſtrates in Rome from the execution of their offices. It was lawful for
                    any tribune to take this ſtep, when the paſſing of the law which he propoſed was
                    prevented by mere chicanery. After this, he aſſembled the people anew, and made
                    a ſecond attempt to ſucceed in lus deſign. When all things were got ready for
                    collecting the ſuffrages, the rich privately conveyed away the urns in which the
                    tablets were kept. This kindled the tribune’s indignation, and the rage of the
                    people. The comitium was like to become a field of battle, when two venerable
                    ſenators, Manlius and Fulvius, very ſea-ſonably interpoſed ; and throwing
                    themſelves at the tribune’s feet, prevailed upon him to ſubmit his law to the
                    judgment of the conſcript fathers. This was making the ſenators judges in their
                    own cauſe : but Gracchus thought the law ſo undeniably juſt, that he could not
                    perſuade himſelf that they would reject it ; and if they did, he knew that the
                    incenſed multitude would no longer keep any meaſures with them.</p>
                <p>The ſenate, who wanted nothing but to gain time, affected delays, and came to no
                    reſolution. There were indeed ſome among them, who, out of a principle of
                    equity, were for paying ſome regard to the complaints of the tribune, and for
                    ſacriſicing their own intereſt to the relief of the diſtreſſed. But the far
                    greater part would not hear of any compoſition whatſoever. Hereupon Gracchus
                    brought the affair anewbefore the people, and earneſtly intreated his colleague
                    Octavius to drop his oppoſition, in compaſſion to the many unfortunate people
                    for whom he interceded. He put him in mind of their ancient friendſhip, took him
                    by the hand, and affectionately embraced him. But ſtill Octavius was inflexible.
                    Hereupon Gracchus reſolved to deprive Octavius of his tribuneſhip, ſince he
                    alone obſtinately withſtood the deſires of the whole body of ſo great a people.
                    Having therefore aſſembled the people, he told them, that ſince his colleague
                    and he were divided in opinion, and the republic ſuffered by their diviſion, it
                    was the province of the tribes aſſembled in comitia to re-eſtabliſh concord
                    among their tribunes. “ If the cauſe I maintain (ſaid he) be, in your opinion,
                    unjuſt, I am ready to give up my ſeat in the college. On the contrary, if you
                    judge me worthy of being continued in your fer∙ vice in this ſtation, deprive
                    him of the tribuneſhip who alone obſtructs my wiſhes. As ſoon as you ſhall have</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0372" facs="gri_33125011196389_0378.tif"/>
                <p>nominated one to ſucceed him, the law will paſs without oppoſition.” Having thus
                    ſpoken, he diſmiſſed the aſſembly, after having ſummoned them to meet again the
                    next day.</p>
                <p>And now Gracchus, being ſoured with the oppoſition he had met with from the
                    rich, and from his obſtinate colleague, and being well appriſed that the law
                    would paſs in any form in which he ſhould think fit to propoſe it, reſolved to
                    revive it as it was at firſt paſſed, without abating any thing of its ſeverity.
                    There was no exception in favour of the children in families ; or reimburſement
                    promiled to thoſe who ſhould part with the lands they poſſeſſed above <hi
                        rend="italic"> ξoo</hi> acres. The next day the people being aſſembled in
                    vaſt crowds on this extraordinary occaſion, Gracchus made freſh applications io
                    Octavius, but to no purpoſe; he obſtinately perſiſted in his oppoſition. Then
                    Gracchus turning to the people, “ Judge you, (ſaid he), which of.us deſerves to
                    be deprived of his office.” At theſe words the firſt tribe voted, and declared
                    ſor the depoſition of Octavius. Upon which Gracchus, iulpending the ardour of
                    the tribes, made another effort to bring over his opponent by gentle methods.
                    But all his endeavours proving ineffectual,</p>
                <p>the other tribes went on to vote in their turns, and followed the example of the
                    firſt. Of 35 tribes, 17 had already declared againſt Octavius, and the 18∙th was
                    juſt going to determine the affair, when Gracchus, being willing to try once
                    more whether he could reclaim his colleague, ſuſpended the collecting of the
                    ſuffrages; and addreſſing Octavius in the moſt preſſing terms, conjured him not
                    to expoſe himſelf, by his obſtinacy, to ſo great a diſgrace, nor to give him the
                    grief of having caſt a blennſh upon his colleague and friend, which neither time
                    nor merit would ever wipe off. Octavius, however, continuing obſtinate, was
                    depoſed, and the law paſſed as Gracchus had propoſed it the laſt time. The
                    depoſed tribune was dragged from the roſtra by the incenſed multitude, who would
                    have inſulted him further, had not the ſenators and his friends facilitated his
                    eſcape.</p>
                <p>The Licinian law being thus revived with one conſent both by the city and
                    country tribes, Gracchus cauſed the people to appoint triumvirs, or three
                    com-miſſioners, to haften its execution. In this commiſſion the people gave
                    Gracchus the firſt place ; and he had intereſt enough to get his father-in-law
                    Appius Claudius, and his brother Caius Gracchus, appointed his colleagues. Theſe
                    three ſpent the whole ſummer in - travelling through all the Italian provinces,
                    to examine •what lands were held by any perſon above 500 acres, in order to
                    divide them among the poor citizens. When Gracchus returned from his progreſs,
                    he found, by the death of his chief agent, that his abſence had not abated
                    either the hatred of the rich, or the love of the poor, toward him. As it
                    plainly appeared that the deceaſed had been poiſoned, the tribune took this
                    occaſion to apply himſelf again to his protectors, and implore their aſſiſtance
                    againſt the violence and treachery of his-ene-mies. The populace, more attached
                    after this accident to their hero than ever, declared they would ſtand by him to
                    the laſt drop of their blood ; and this their zeal encouraged him to add a new
                    clauſe to the law, viz. that the commiſſioners ſhould likewiſe inquire what
                    lands had been uſurped from the republic. This was touching the ſenators in a
                    moſt tender point ; for moſt</p>
                <p>of them had appropriated to themſelves lands belonging to the republic. But
                    after all, the tribune, upon a ſtrict inquiry, found that the lands taken from
                    the rich would not be enough to content all the poor citizens. But the following
                    accident eaſed him of this difficulty, and enabled him to ſtop the murmurs of
                    the malcontents , among the people.</p>
                <p>Attalus Philometer, king of Pergamus, having bequeathed his dominions and
                    effects to the Romans, Eudemus the Pergamean brought his treaſures to Rome at
                    this time ; and Gracchus immediately got a new law paſſed, enacting, that this
                    money ſhould be divided among the poor citizens who could not have lands ; and
                    chat the diſpoſal of the revenues of Pergamus ſhould not be in the ſenate, but
                    in the comitia. By theſe ſteps Gracchus moſt effectually humbled the ſenate;
                    who, in order to diſcredit him among the people, gave out that Eudemus, who had
                    brought the king’s will to Rome, had leſt with Gracchus the royal diadem and
                    mantle of Attalus, which the law-making tribune was to uſe wher*he ſhould be
                    proclaimed king of Rome. But theſe reports only ſerved to make Gracchus be more
                    upon his guard, and to inſpire the people with an implacable hatred againſt the
                    rich who were the authors of them. Gracchus being now, by his power-over the
                    minds of the multitude, abſolute mälter of their ſuffrages, formed a deſign of
                    raiſing his father-in-law Appius Claudius to the conſulate next year, of
                    promoting his brother Caius to the tribuneſhip, and getting himſelf continued in
                    the ſame office. The laſt was what moſt nearly concerned him ; his perſon, as
                    long as he was in office; being ſacred and inviolable. As the ſenate was very
                    active in endeavouring to get ſuch only elected into the college of tribunes as
                    were enemies to Gracchus and his faction, the tribune left no ſtone unturned to
                    ſecure his election. He told the people, that the rich had reſolved to
                    aſſaſſinate him as ſoon as he was out of his office ; he appeared in mourning,
                    as was the cuſtom in the greateſt calamities ; and bringing his children, yet
                    young, into the forum, recommended them to the people in ſuch terms, as ſhowed
                    that he deſpaired of his own preſervation. At this fight the populace returned
                    no anſwer, but by outcries and menaces againſt the rich.</p>
                <p>When the day appointed for the election of new tribunes came, the people were
                    ordered to aſſemble in the capitol in the great court before the'temple of
                    Jupiter. The tribes being met, Gracchus produced his petition, intreating the
                    people to continue him one year longer in the office of tribune, in
                    conſideration of the· great danger to which he was expoſed, the rich having
                    vowed his deſtruction as ſoon as his perſon ſhould be no-more ſacred. This was
                    indeed an unuſual requeſt, it having been long cuſtomary not to continue any
                    tribune in his office above a year. However, the tribes began· to vote, and the
                    two firſt declared for Gracchus. Hereupon the rich made great clamours ; which
                    terrified Rubrius Varro, who preſided in the college of tribunes that day, to
                    ſuch a degree, that he reſigned his place to Q. Mummius, who offered to preſide
                    in. his room. But this raiſed a tumult among the tribunes themſelves ; ſo-that
                    Gracchus wiſely diſmiſſed the aſſembly, and order·* ed them to meet again the
                    next day.</p>

                <p>powerful a protector, not only conducted him home, but watched by turns all
                    night at his door. Next morning by break of day, Gracchus having aſſembled his
                    friends, led them from his houſe, and poſted one half oi them in the'comitium,
                    while he went up himſelf with the other to the capitol. As ſoon as he appeared,
                    the people ſaluted him with loud acclamations of joy.- But ſcarce was he placed
                    in his tribunal, when Fulvius Flaccus a ſenator, and friend to Gracchus,
                    breaking through the crowd, came up to him, and gave him notice, that the
                    ſenators, who were aſſembled in the temple of Faith, which almoſt touched that
                    of Jupiter Capitolinus, had conſpired againſt his liſe, and were reſolved to
                    attack him openly on his very tribunal. Hereupon Gracchus tucked up his robe, as
                    it were, to prepare for a battle ; and, after his example, ſome of his party,
                    ſeizing the ſtaves of the apparitors, prepared to defend themſelves, and to
                    repel force by force. Theſe preparations terrified the other tribunes ; who
                    immediately abandoned their places in a cowardly manner, and mixed with the
                    crowd ; while the prieſts ran to ſhut the gates of the temple, for fear of its
                    being profaned. On the other hand, the fi iends of Gracchus, who were diſperſed
                    by parties in different places, cried out, <hi rend="italic">11'e are ready :
                        IVhat mu ft we do ?</hi> Gracchus, whoſe voice could not be heard by all
                    his adherents on account of the tumult, the clamours, and the confuſed cries of
                    the different parties, put his hand to his head ; which was the ſignal agreed on
                    to prepare for battle. But ſome of his enemies, putting a malicious conſtruction
                    upon that geſture, immediately flew to. the ſenate, and told the fathers, that
                    the ſeditious tribune had called for the crown to be put upon his head. Hereupon
                    the ſenators, fancying they already ſaw the king oi Perga-mus’s diadem on the
                    tribune’s head, and the royal mantle on his ſhoulders, reſolved to give the
                    conſul leave to arm his legions, treat the friends of Gracchus as enemies, and
                    turn the comitium into a field of battle.</p>
                <p>But the conſul Mutius Scævola, who was a prudent-and moderate man, refuſed to be
                    the inſtrument of their raſh revenge, and to diſhonour his contulate with the
                    maſſacre of a diſarmed people. As Calpur-r.ius Piſo, the other conſul, was then
                    in Sicily, the moſt turbulent among the ſenators cried out, “ Since one of our
                    conſuls is abſent, and the other betrays the republic, let us do ourſelves
                    juſtice ; let us immediately go and demoliſh with our own bands this idol of the
                    people.” Scipio Naſica, who had been all along ſor violent meaſures, inveighed
                    bitterly againſt the conſul for refuſing to ſuccour the republic in her greateſt
                    diſtreſs. Scipio Naſica was the great grandſon of Cneius Scipio, the uncle of
                    the firſt Africanus, and conſequently couſin to the Gracchi by their mother
                    Cornelia. But nevertheleſs not one of the ſenators betrayed a more
                    irreconcileable hatred againſt the tribune than he. When the prudent conſul
                    refuſed to arm his legions, and put the adherents of Gracchus to death contrary
                    to the uſual forms of juſtice, he ſet no bounds to his fury, but, riſing up from
                    his place, cried out like a madman, “ Since our conſul betrays us, let thoſe who
                    love the republic follow me.” Having uttered theſe words, he immediately walked
                    out of the temple, attended by a great number of ſenators.</p>
                <p>Naſica threw his robe over his ſhoulders, and having covered his head with it,
                    advanced with his followers into the crowd, where he was joined by a company of
                    the clients and friends of the patricians, armed with ſtaves and clubs. Theſe,
                    falling indifferently upon all who ſtood in their way, diſperſed the crowd. Many
                    of Gracchus’s party took to their heels ; and in that tumult all the feats being
                    overturned and broken, Naſica, armed with the leg of a broken bench, knocked
                    down all who oppoſed him, and at length reached Gracchus. One of his party
                    ſeized the tribune by the lappet of his robe : but he, quitting his gown, fled
                    in his tunic ; and as he was in that hurry of ſpirits, which is inſeparabie ſrom
                    ſear, leaping over the broken benches, he had the misfortune to flip and fall.
                    As he was getting up again, he received a blow on the head, which ſtunned him :
                    then his adverſaries ruſhing in upon him, with repeated blows put an end to his
                    life.</p>
                <p>Rome was by his death delivered, according to Cicero, from a domeſtic enemy, who
                    was more formidable to lier than even, that Numantia, which had firſt kindled
                    his reſentments. Perhaps no man was ever born with greater talents, or more
                    capable of aggrandizing himſelf, and doing honour to his country. But his great
                    mind, his manly courage, his lively, eaſy, and powerful eloquence, were, ſays
                    Cicero, like a ſword in the hands of a madman. Gracchus ab uſed them, not in
                    ſupporting an unjuſt cauſe, but in conducting a good one with too much violence.
                    He went ſo far as to make ſome believe that he had really ſomething in view
                    beſides the intereſt of the people whom he pre-· tended to relieve; and
                    therefore ſome hiſtorians have, repreſented him as a tyrant. But the moſt
                    judicious, writers clear him from this imputation, and aſeribe his firſt deſign
                    of reviving, the Licinian law to an eager deſire of being revenged on the
                    ſenators for the affront they had very unjuſtly put upon him, and the conſul
                    Mancinus, as we have hinted above. The law he attempted to revive had an air of
                    juſtice, which gave a fonction to his revenge, without calling any blemiſh on
                    his reputation.</p>
                <p>The death of Gracchus did not pul an end to the tumult. Above 300 of the
                    tribune’s friends loſt their lives in the fray ; and their bodies were thrown,
                    with that of Gracchus, into the Tiber. Nay, the ſenate carried their revenge
                    beyond the fatal day which had ſtained the Capitol with Roman blood. They ſought
                    for all the friends of the late tribune, and without any form of law
                    aſſaſſinated ſome, and forced others into, baniſhment. Caius Billiua, one of the
                    moſt zealous defenders of the people, was ſeized by his enemies, and ſhut up in
                    a caſk with ſnakes and vipers, where he mi-ſerably periſhed. Though the laws
                    prohibited any citizen to take away the life of another before he had been
                    legally condemned, Naſica and his followers were acquitted by the ſenate, who
                    enacted a decree, juſtify-ing all the cruelties committed againſt Gracchus and
                    his adherents.</p>
                <p>Theſe diſturbances were for a ſhort time interrupted by a revolt of the ſlaves
                    in Sicily, occaſioned by the cruelty of their maſters ; but they being ſoon
                    reduced, the conteſts about the <hi rend="italic">Sempronian law,</hi> as it
                    was called, again took place. Both parties were determined not to ) ield ; and
                    therefore the moſt fatal effects enſued» The firſt thing of conſequence was the
                    death of <hi rend="italic">Seit</hi></p>

                <p>pio Africanus the Second, who was privately ſtrangled in his bed by ſome of the
                    partiſans of the plebeian party, about 129 B. Ç. Caius Gracchus, brother to him
                    who had been formerly killed, not only undertook the revival of the Sempronian
                    law, but propoſed anew one, granting the rights of Roman citizens to all the
                    Italian allies, who could receive no ſhare of the lands divided in conſequence
                    of the Sempronian law. The conſequences of this were much worſe than the former
                    ; the flame ſpread through all Italy ; and the nations who had made war with the
                    republic in its infancy again commenced enemies more formidable than before.
                    Fregellæ, a city of the Volſci, revolted : but being ſuddenly attacked, was
                    obliged to ſubmit, and was raſed to the ground ; which quieted matters for the
                    preſent. Gracchus, however, ſtill continued his attempts to humble the ſenate
                    and the reſt of the patrician body : the ultimate conſequence of which was, that
                    a price was ſet on his head, and that of Fulvius his confederate, no leſs than
                    their weight in gold, to any one who ſhould bring them to Opimius the chief of
                    the patrician party. Thus the cuſtom of proſcription was begun by the
                    patricians, of which they themſelves ſoon had enough. Gracchus and Fulvius were
                    ſacrificed, but the diſorders of the republic were not ſo eaſily cured.</p>
                <p>The inundation of the Cimbri and Teutones put a ſtop to the civil diſcords for
                    ſome time longer ; but they being defeated, as related under the articles Ci με
                    tu and Teutones, nothing prevented the troubles from being revived with greater
                    fury than before, except the war with tl⅜e Sicilian ſlaves, which had again
                    commenced with more dangerous circumſtances than ever. But this war being
                    totally ended about 99 B. C. no farther obſtacle remained. Marius, the conqueror
                    of Jugurtha<note anchored="true" place="margin" type="authorial">See
                            Nu<unclear>m</unclear>idia.</note> and the Cimbri, undertook the cauſe
                    of the plebeians againſt the ſenate and patricians. Having aſſociated himſelf
                    with Apuleius and Glaucia, two factious men, they caιτied their proceedings to
                    ſuch a length, that an open rebellion commenced, and Marius himſelf was obliged
                    to act againſt his allies. Peace* however, was for the preſent reſtored by the
                    maſſacre of Apuleius and Glaucia, with a great number of their followers ; upon
                    which Marius thought proper to leave the city.</p>
                <p>While factious men thus endeavoured to tear the republic in pieces, the attempts
                    of well-meaning people to heal thoſe diviſions ſerved only to involve the ſtate
                    in calamities ſtill more grievous. The conſuls obſerved, that many individuals
                    of the Italian allies lived at Rome, and falſely pretended to be Roman citizens.
                    By means of them, it was likewiſe perceived, that the plebeian party had
                    acquired a great deal of its power ; as the votes of theſe pretended citizens
                    were always at the ſervice of the tribunes. The conſuls therefore got a law
                    paſſed, commanding all thoſe pretended citizens to return home. This was ſo much
                    reſented by the Italian ſtates, that an univerſal defection took place. A ſeheme
                    was then formed by M. Livius Druſus, a tribune of the people, to reconcile all
                    orders of men ; but this only made matters worſe, and procured his own
                    aſ-ſaſſination. His death ſeemed a ſignal for war. The Marſi, Peligni, Samnites,
                    Campanians, and Luea-nians, and in ſhort all the provinces from the river Li-ris
                    to the Adriatic, revolted at once, and formed themſelves into a republic, in
                    oppoſition to that of Rome.</p>
                <p>The haughty Romans were now made thoroughly ſenſible that they were not
                    invincible : they were defeated in almoſt every engagement ; and muſt ſoon have
                    yielded, bad they pot fallen upon a method of dividing their enemies. A law was
                    paſſed, enacting, that all the nations in Italy, whoſe alliance with Rome was
                    indiſputable, ſhould enjoy the right of Roman citizens. This drew off ſeveral
                    nations from the alliance ; and at the ſame time, Sylla taking upon him the
                    command of the Roman armies, fortune ſoon declared in favour of the latter.</p>
                <p>The ſucceſs of Rome againſt the allies ſerved only to bring greater miſeries
                    upon herſelf. Marius and Sylla became rivals ; the former adhering to the
                    people, and the latter to the patricians. Marius aſſociated with one ot the
                    tribunes named <hi rend="italic">Sulpitius ;</hi> in conjunction with whom he
                    raiſed ſuch diſturbances, that Sylla was forced to retire ſrom the city. Having
                    thus driven off his rival, Marius got himſelf appointed, general againſt
                        Mithridates<note anchored="true" place="margin" type="authorial">See <hi
                            rend="italic">Pontus.</hi></note> king of Pontus ; but the ſoldiers
                    reſuſed to obey any other than Sylla. A civil war immediately enſued, in which
                    Marius was driven out in his turn, find a price ſet upon his head and that of
                    Sulpitius, with many of their adherents. Sulpitius was ſoon ſeized and killed ;
                    but Marius made his eſcape. In the mean time, however, the cruelties of Sylla
                    rendered him obnoxious both to the ſenate and people ; and Ci-na, a furious
                    partiſan of the Marian faction, being choſen conſul, cited him to give an
                    account of his conduct. Upon this Sylla thought proper to ſet out ſor Aſia :
                    Marius was recalled from Africa, whither he had fled ; and immediately on his
                    landing in Italy, was joined by a great number of ſhepherds, ſlaves, and men of
                    deſperate fortunes ; ſo that he ſoon ſaw himſelf at the head of a conſiderable
                    army.</p>
                <p>Cinna, in the mean time, whom the ſenators had depoſed and driven out of Rome,
                    ſolicited and obtained a powerful army from the allies ; and being joined by
                    Sertorius, a moſt able and experienced general, the two, in conjunction with
                    Marius, advanced towards the capital ; and as their forces daily increaſed, a
                    fourth army was formed under the command of Papirius Carbo. The ſenate raiſed
                    ſome forces to defend the city ; but the troops being vaſtly inferior in number,
                    and likewiſe inclined to the contrary ſide, they were obliged to open their
                    gates to the confederates. Marius entered at the head of a numerous guard,
                    compoſed of ſlaves, whom he called his <hi rend="italic">Barcliceans,</hi> and
                    whom he deſigned to employ in revenging himſelf on his enemies. The firſt order
                    he gave theſe aſſaſſins was, to murder all who came to ſalute him, and were not
                    anſwered with the like civility. As every one was forward to pay his compliments
                    to the new tyrant, this order proved the deſtruction of vaſt numbers. At laſt
                    theſe Bardiæans abandoned themſelves to ſuch exccſſes in every kind of vice,
                    that Cinna and 3ettorius ordered their troops to fall upon them ; which being
                    inſtantly put in execution, they were all cut off to a man.</p>
                <p>By the deſtruction of his guards, Marius was reduced to the neceſſity of taking
                    a method of gratifying his revenge ſomewhat more tedious, though equally
                    effectual. A conference was held between the four chiefs, in which Marius ſeemed
                    quite frantic with rage. Sertorius endeavoured to moderate his fury ; but, besag</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0375" facs="gri_33125011196389_0381.tif"/>
                <p>ever-ruled by Cinna and Carbo, a reſolution was taken to murder without mercy
                    all the ſenators who had oppoſed the popular faction. This was immediately put
                    in execution. A general ſlaughter commenced, which laſted five days, and during
                    which the greateſt: part of the obnoxious ſenators were cut off, their heads
                    Ruck upon poles over-againſt the roſtra, and their bodies dragged with hooks
                    into the forum, where they were left to be devoured by dogs. Sylla’s houſe was
                    demoliſhed, his goods con ſeated, and he himſelf declared an enemy to his
                    country ; however,, his wife and children had the good fortune to make their
                    eſcape.— This maſſacre was not confined to the city of Rome. The ſoldiers, like
                    as many blood-hounds, were diſperſed over the country in ſearch of thoſe who
                    fled. The neighbouring towns, villages, and all the highways, ſwarmed with
                    aſſaſſins ; and on this occaſion Plutarch obſerves with great concern, that the
                    moſt ſacred ties of friendſhip and hoſpitality are not proof againſt treachery,
                    in the day of adverſity, for there were but very few who did not diſcover their
                    friends who had fled to them for ſhelter.</p>
                <p>This ſlaughter being over, Cinna named himſelf and Marius conſuls for the
                    enſuing year ; and theſe tyrants ſeemed reſolved to begin the new year as they
                    had ended the old one : but, while they were preparing to renew their cruelties,
                    Sylla, having proved victorious in the eaſt, ſent a long letter to the ſenate,
                    giving an account of bis many victories, and his reſolution of returning to
                    Rome, not to reſtore peace to his country, but to revenge himſelf of his
                    enemies, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> to deſtroy thoſe whom Marius had ſpared.
                    This letter occaſioned an univerſal terror. Marius, dreading to enter the lifts
                    with ſuch a renowned warrior, gave himſelf up to exceſſive drinking, and died.
                    His ſon was aſſociated with Cinna in the government, though not in the
                    conſulinip, and proved a tyrant no leſs cruel than his father. the ſenate
                    declared one Valerius Flaccus general of the forces in the eaſt, and appointed
                    him a conſiderable army ; but the troops alt to a man deſerted him, and joined
                    Sylla. Soon after, Cinna declared himſelf conſul a third time, and took for his
                    colleague Papirius Carbo ; but the citizens, dreading the tyranny of theſe
                    inhuman monſters, fled in crowds to Sylla, who was now in Greece. To him the
                    ſenate ſent deputies, begging that he would have compaſſion on his country, and
                    not carry his reſentment to ſuch a length as to begin a civil war : but he
                    replied, that he was coming to Rome full of rage and revenge ; 'and that all his
                    enemies, if the Roman people conſented to it, ſhould periſh either by the ſword
                    or the axes of the executioners. Upon this ſeveral very numerous armies were
                    formed againſt him ; but, through the miſconduct of the generals who commanded
                    them, theſe armies were everywhere dé-feated, or went over to the enemy. Pompey,
                    afterwards ſtyled <hi rend="italic">the Great,</hi> ſignalized <hi rend="sup">,</hi> himſelf in this war, and embraced the party of Sylla. The Italian
                    nations took ſome one ſide and ſome another, as their different inclinations led
                    them. Cinna, in the mean time, was killed in a tumult, and young Marius and
                    Carbo ſucceeded him ; but the former having ventured an engagement with Sylla,
                    was by him defeated, and forcedto fly to Præneite, where he was cloſely
                    beſieged..</p>
                <p>Thus was Rome reduced to the loweſt degree of miſery, when one Pontius
                    Teleſinus, a Samnite of great experience in war, projected the total ruin of the
                    'city. He had joined, or pretended to join, the generals of the Marian faction
                    with an army of 40,000 men ; and therefore marched towards Praeneſte, as if he
                    deſigned to relieve Marius. By th13 means he drew Sylla and Pompey away from the
                    capital ; and then, decamping in the night, over reached theſe two generals, and
                    by break of day was within 10 furlongs of the Collatine gate. He then pulled off
                    the maik ; and declaring himſelf as much an enemy to Marius as to Sylla, told
                    his troops, that it was not bis deſign to aſſiſt one Roman againſt another, but
                    to deſtroy the whole race, <hi rend="sup">u</hi> Let fire and ſword (ſaid he)
                    deſtroy all ; let no quarter be given ; mankind can never be free as long as one
                    Roman is left alive.”—Never had this proud metropolis been in greater danger ;
                    nor ever had any city a more narrow eſcape. The Roman youth marched out to
                    oppoſe him, but were driven back with great ſlaughter. Sylla himſelf was
                    defeated, and forced to fly to his camp. Teleſinus advanced with more fury than
                    ever ; but, in the mean time, the other wing of his army having been defeated by
                    M. Craſſus, the victorious general attacked the body where Teleſinus commanded,
                    and by putting· them to flight, ſaved his country from the moſt imminent danger.</p>
                <p>Sylla, having now no enemy to fear, marched firſt to Atemnæ, and thence to Rome.
                    From the former •city he carried 8000 priſoners to Rome, and cauſed them all to
                    be maſſacred at once in the circus. His cruelty next fell upon the Prasneſtines,
                    12,oco of whom were maſſacred without mercy. Young Marius had killed himſelf, in
                    order to avoid falling into the hands of ſuch a cruel enemy. Soon after, the
                    inhabitants of Norba, a city of Campania, finding themſelves unable to reſiſt
                    the forces of the tyrant, ſet fire to their houſes» and all periſhed in the
                    flames. The taking of theſe cities put an end to the civil war, but not to the
                    cruelties ol Sylla. Having aſſembled the people in the co-mitium, he told the·/,
                    that he was reſolved not to ſpare a ſingle perſon who had borne arms againſt
                    him. This cruel reſolution he put in execution with the moſt unrelenting vigour
                    ; and having at laſt cut off all thoſe who n he thought capable of oppoſing him,
                    Sylla cauſed hin ſelf to be declared perpetual dictator, or, in other words,
                    king and abſolute ſovereign of Rome.</p>
                <p>This revolution happened about 80 B. C. and from this time we may date the loſs
                    of the Ro nan liberty. Sylla indeed reſigned his power in two years ; but the
                    citizens of Rone having once ſubmitted, were ever after n ore inclined to ſubmit
                    to a maſter. Though individuals retained the ſame enthuſiaſtic notions of
                    liberty as before, yet the minds of the generality ſeem fro n this time to have
                    inclined towards monarchy«, New maſters were indeed already prepared for the
                    republic. Cæſar and Fompey had eminently diſtinguiſhed the Helves by their
                    martial exploits, and were already rivals. They were, however, for ſo e ti ne
                    prevented froτι raiſing any diſturbances by being kept at a diſtance ſrom each
                    other. Sertorius, one of the generals of the Marian faction, and the only one of
                    them poſſeſſed either of honour or probity, had retired</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0376" facs="gri_33125011196389_0382.tif"/>
                <p>lnto Spain, where he erected a republic independent oſ Ro e. Pompey and
                    Metellus, two of the beſt reputed generals in Ro ∙ e, were ſent againſt hi r ;
                    but inſtead of conquering, they were on all occaſions conquered by him, and
                    obliged to abandon their enterpriſe with diſgrace. At lait Sertorius was
                    treacherouſly murdered ; and the traitors, who after his death uſurped the
                    command, being totally deſſtute of his abilites, were eaſily defeated by Pompey
                    : and thus that general reaped an undeſerved honour from concluding the war with
                    ſucceſs.</p>
                <p>The Spaniſh war was ſcarce ended, when a very dangerous one was excited by
                    Spartacus, a Thracian gladiator. For ſome time this rebel proved very
                    luc-ceſsful ; but at laſt was totally defeated and killed by Craſſus. The
                    fugitives, however, rallied again, to the number of 5000 ; but, being totally
                    defeated by Pompey, the latter took occaſion from thence to claim the glory
                    which was juſtly due to Craſſus. Being thus become extremely popular, and
                    ſetting no bounds to his ambiti <hi rend="sup">z</hi> on, he was choſen conſul
                    along with Craſſus. .Both generals were at the head of powerful armies ; and *
                    conteſt between them immediately began about who ſhould firſt lay down their
                    arms. With difficulty they were in appearance reconciled, and immediately began
                    to oppoſe one another in a new way. Pompey courted the favour of the people, by
                    reinſtating the tribunes in their ancient power, which had been greatly abridged
                    by Sylla. Craſſus. though naturally covetous, entertained the populace with
                    ſurpriſing profuſion at ιc,oco tables, and at the ſame time diſtributed corn
                    ſufficient to maintain their families for three months.— Theſe prodigious
                    expences will ſeem leſs ſurpriſing, when we conſider that Craſſus was the
                    richeſt man in Rome, and that his eſtate amounted to upwards of 70Ö0 talents, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> 1,356,250 1. ſterling. Notwithſtanding his
                    utmoſt efforts, however, Pompey ſtill had the ſuperiority ; and was therefore
                    propoſed as a proper perſon to be employed for clearing the ſeas of pirates. -In
                    this new ſtation a moſt extenſive power was to be granted to him. He was to have
                    an abſolute authority for three years over all the ſeas within the ſtraits or
                    pillars of Hercules, and over all the countries for the ſpace of 400 furlongs
                    from the ſea. He was empowered to raiſe as many ſoldiers and mariners as he
                    thought proper ; to take what ſums o'f money he pleaſed out of the public
                    treaſury without being accountable for them ; and to chooſe out of the ſenate
                    fifteen ſenators to be his lieutenants, and to execute his orders when he
                    himſelf could not be preſent. I he ſenſible part of the people were againſt
                    inveſting one man with ſo much power ; but the unthinking multitude rendered all
                    oppoſition fruitleſs. The tribune Roſeius attempted to ſpeak againſt it, but was
                    prevented by the clamours of the people. He then held up two of lus fingers, to
                    ſhow that he was for dividing that extenſive commiſſion between two perſons :
                    byt on this the aſſembly burſt out into ſuch hideous outcries, that a crow
                    flying accidentally over the comitium, was ſtunned with the noiſe, and ſell down
                    among the rabble. This law being agreed to, Pompey executed his commiſſion ſo
                    much to the public ſatisfaction, that on his return a new law was .propoſed in
                    bis favour. By this he was to be appointed general of all the forces in Aſia ;
                    and as he was ſtill <hi rend="sub">t</hi> o.retain the ſovereignty of the
                    ſeas, he was now in</p>
                <p>fact made ſovereign of all the Roman empire.— This law was ſupported by Cicero
                    and Cæſar, the former aſpiring at the conſulate, and the latter pleaſed to ſee
                    the Romans ſo readily appointing themſelves a maſter. Pompey, however, executed
                    his commiſſion with the utmoſt fidelity and ſucceſs, completing the conqueſt of
                    Pontus, Albania, Iberia, &amp;c. which had been ſucceſsfully begun by Sylla
                    and Lu-∙cullus.</p>
                <p>But while Pompey was thus aggrandiſing himſelf, the republic was on the point of
                    being ſubverted by a conſpiracy formed by Lucius Sergius Catiline. He was
                    deſeended from an illuſtrious family ; but having •quite ruined his eſtate, and
                    rendered himſelf infamous by a ſeries of the moſt deteſtable crimes, he
                    aſſociated with a number of others in circumſtances ſimilar to his own, in order
                    to repair their broken fortunes by ruining their country. Their ſeheme was to
                    murder the conſuls together with the greateſt part of the ſenators, ſet fire to
                    the city in different places, and then ſeize the government. This wicked deſign
                    miſcarried twice'; but was not on that account dropped by the conſpirators.
                    Their party increaſed every day ; and both Cæſar and Craſſus, who ſince the
                    departure of Pompey had ſtudied to gain the affections of the people as far as
                    poſſible, were thought to have been privy to the conſpiracy. At laſt, however,
                    the matter was diſcovered by means of a young knight, who had indiſe creetly
                    revealed the ſecret to his paramour. Catiline then openly took the field, and
                    ſoon raiſed a conſiderable army : but was utterly defeated and killed about 62
                    B. C. ; and thus the republic was freed from the preſent danger.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, Cæſar continued to advance in popularity and in power. Soon
                    after the defeat' of Catiline, he was created pontifex maximus ; and after that
                    was ſent into Spain, where he ſubdued ſeveral nations that had never before been
                    ſubject to Rome.— While he was thus employed, his rival Pompey returned from the
                    eaſt, and was received with the higheſt honours ; but though ſtill as ambitious
                    as ever, he now affected extraordinary modeſty, and declined accepting of the
                    applauſe which was offered him. His aim was to aiſu e a ſovereign authority
                    without ſeeming to deſire it ; but he was ſoon convinced, that, if he deſired to
                    reign over his fellow-citizens, it muſt be by force of 'arms. He therefore
                    renewed his intrigues, and ſpared no pains, however mean and ſcandalous, to
                    increaſe his popularity. Cæſar, on his return from Spain, found the ſovereignty
                    divided between Craſſus and Pompey, each of whom was ineffectually ſtruggling to
                    get the better of the other. Cælar, no leſs ambitious than the other two,
                    propoſed that they ſhould put an end to their differences, and take him for a
                    partner in their power. In ihort, he projected a triumvirate, or aſſociation of
                    three perſons, (Pompey, Craſſus, and himſelf), in which ſhould be lodged the
                    whole power of the ſenate and people ; and, in order to .make their confederacy
                    more laſting, they bound themſelves by mutual oaths and promiſes to ſtand by
                    each other, and ſuffer nothing to be undertaken or carried into execution
                    without the unanimous conſent of all the three.</p>
                <p>Thus was the liberty of the Ro trans taken away a ſecond time, nor did they ever
                    afterwards recover it .; though at preſent none perceived that this was the
                    caſe,</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0377" facs="gri_33125011196389_0383.tif"/>
                <p>except Cato. The aſſociation of the triumvirs was for a long time kept ſecret ;
                    and nothing appeared to the people except the reconciliation of Pompey and
                    Craſſiis, for which the ſtate reckoned itſelf indebted to Cæſar. The firſt
                    conſequence of the triumvirate was the conſulſhip of Julius Cæſar. But though
                    this was obtained by the favour of Pompey and Craſſus, he found himſelſ
                    diſappointed in the colleague hc wanted to aſſociate with him in that office. He
                    had pitched upon one whom he knew he could manage as he pleaſed, and diſtributed
                    large ſums among the people in order to engage them to vote for him. The ſenate,
                    however, and even Cato himſelf, reſolved to defeat the triumvir at his own
                    weapons ; and having therefore ſet up another candidate, diſtributed ſuch
                    immenſe ſums on the oppoſite ſide, that Cæſar, notwithſtanding the vaſt riches
                    he had acquired, was forced to yield. This defeat proved of ſmall conſequence.
                    Cæſar ſet himſelf to engage the affections of the people ; and this he did, by
                    an agrarian law, ſo effectually, that he was in a manner idolized. The law was
                    in itſelf very reaſonable and juſt ; nevertheleſs, the ſenate, perceiving the
                    deſign with which it was propoſed, thought themſelves bound to oppoſe it. Their
                    oppoſition, however, proved fruitleſs : the conſul Bibulus, who ſhewed himſelf
                    moſt active in his endeavours againſt it, was driven out of the aſſembly with
                    the greateſt indignity, and from that day became of no conſideration ; ſo that
                    Cæſar was reckoned the ſole conſul.</p>
                <p>The next ſtep taken by Cæſar was to ſecure the knights, as he had already done
                    the people ; and for this purpoſe he abated a third of the rents which they
                    «annually paid into the treaſury ; after which he governed Rome with an abſolute
                    ſway during the time of his conſulate. The reign of this triumvir, however, was
                    ended by his expedition into Gaul, where his military exploits acquired him the
                    higheſt reputation.— Pompey and Craſſus in the mean time became conſuls, and
                    governed as deſpotically as Cæſar himſelſ had done. On the expiration of their
                    firſt conſulate, the republic fell into a kind of anarchy, entirely owing to the
                    diſor-&lt;]eιs occaſioned by the two late conſuls. At laſt, however, this
                    confuſion was ended by raiſing Craſſus and Pompey to the conſulate a ſecond
                    time. This was no ſooner done, than a new partition of the empire was propoſed.
                    Craſſus was to have Syria and all the eaſtern provinces, Pompey was to govern
                    Africa and Spain, and Cæſar to be continued in Gaul, and all this for the ſpace
                    of five years. This law was paſſed by a great majority ; upon which Craſſus
                    undertook an expedition againſt the Parthians, whom he imagined he ſhould eaſily
                    overcome, and then enrich himſelf with their ſpoils ; Cæſar applied with great
                    aſſiduity to the completing of the conqueſt of Gaul ; and Pompey having nothing
                    to do in his province, ſtaid at Rome to govern the republic alone.</p>
                <p>The affairs of the Romans were now haſtening to a criſis. Craſſus, having
                    oppreſſed all the provinces of the eaſt, was totally defeated and killed by the
                    Parthians * ; after which the two great rivals Cæſar and Pompey were left alone,
                    without any third perſon who could hold the balance between them, or prevent the
                    deadly quarrels which were about to enſue. Matters, however, continued pretty
                    quiet till Gaul was reduced to a Roman province<note anchored="true"
                        place="margin" type="suthorial">See <hi rend="italic">Parthia.</hi></note>.
                    The queſtion then was, whether Cæſar or Pompey ſhould firſt reſign the eommanl
                    of their armies, and return to the rank of private perſons. As both parties
                    ſaw·, that whoever firſt laid down his arms muſt of courſe ſubmit to the other,
                    both refuſed to diſarm themſelves. As Cæſar, however, had a naſſed immenſe
                    riches in Gaul, he was now in a condition not only to maintain an army oapable
                    of vying with Pompey, but even to buy over the leading men in Rome to lſis
                    intereſt. One of the conſuls, named <hi rend="italic">ÆmiHut Paulus,</hi> coſt. him no leſs than ί 500 talents, or 310,62 j 1. ſterling ; but the other,
                    named <hi rend="italic">Marcellus,</hi> could not be gained at any price.
                    Pompey had put at the head of the tribunes one Scribonius Curio, a young
                    patrician of great abilities, but ſo exceedingly debauched and extravagant, that
                    he owed upwards of four millions and a half of our money. Cæſar, by enabling him
                    to ſatisfy his creditors, and ſupplying him with money to purſue his
                    debaucheries, ſecured him in his intereſt ; and Curio, without ſeeming to be in
                    Cæſar’s intereſt, found means to do hi n the moſt eſſential ſervice. He propoſed
                    that both generals ſhould be recalled ; being well aſſured that Pompey would
                    never conſent to part with his army, or lay down the government of Spain with
                    which he had been inveſted, io that Cæſar might draw ſrom Pom-pey’s refuſal a
                    pretence for continuing himſelſ in his province at the head of his troops. This
                    propoſal threw the oppoſite party into great embarraſſments ; and while both
                    profeſſed their pacific intentions, both continued in readineſs for the moſt
                    obſtinate and bloody war.— Cicero took upon himſelf the office of mediator ; but
                    Pompey would hearken to no terms of accommodation. The orator, ſurpriſed to find
                    him ſo obſtinate, at the ſame time that he neglected to ſtrengthen his army,
                    alked him with what forces he deſigned to make head againſt Cæſar? To which the
                    other anſwered, that he needed but ſtamp with his foot, and an army would liait
                    up out of the ground. This confidence he aſſumed becauſe he perſuaded himſelf
                    that Cæſar’s mpn would abandon him if matters came to extremities. Cæſar,
                    however, though he affected great moderation, yet kept himſelf in readineſs for
                    the worſt ; and therefore, when the ſenate palled the fatal decree for a civil
                    war, he was not in the leaſt alarmed. This decree was iſſued in the year 49 B.
                    C. and was expreſſed in the following words: “ Let the conſuls for the year, the
                    proconſul Pompey, the prætors, and all thoſe in or near Rome who have been
                    conſuls, provide lor the public ſafety by the moſt proper means.” This decree
                    was no ſooner paſſed, than the conſul Marcellus went, with his colleague
                    Lentulus, to an houſe at a ſmall diſtance from the town, where Pompey then was ;
                    and preſenting him with a ſword, “ We require you (ſaid he) to take upon you
                    with this the defence of the republic, and the command of her troops.” Pompey
                    obeyed ; and Cæſar was by the fame decree diveſted of his office, and one Lucius
                    Domitius appointed to ſucceed him, the new governor being empowered to raiſe
                    4000 men in order to take poſſeſſion of his province.</p>
                <p>War being thus reſolved on, the ſenate and Pompey began to make the neceſſary
                    preparations for oppoſing Cæſar. The attempt of the latter to withſtand their
                    authority they termed a <hi rend="italic">tumult ;</hi> from which
                    contemptible epithet it appeared that they either did not know, or did not
                    dread, the enemy whom they wert· bringing upon themſelves. However, they ordered
                    30,000 Ro-</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0378" facs="gri_33125011196389_0384.tif"/>
                <p>màn forces to be aſſembled, together with as many foreign troops as Pompey
                    ſhould think proper ; the expence of which armament was defrayed ſrorftthe
                    public treaſury. The governments of provinces, and all public honours, were
                    bellowed upon ſuch as were remarkable for their attachment to Pompey and their
                    enmity to Cæſar. The latter, however, was by no means wanting in what concerned
                    his own intereſt. Three of the tribunes who had been his friends were driven out
                    of Rome, and arrived in his camp diſguiſed like Haves. Cæſar ſhowed them to his
                    army in this ignominious habit ; and, ſetting forth the iniquity of the ſenate
                    and patricians, exhorted his men to ſtand by their general under whom they had
                    ſerved ſo long with ſucceſs ; and finding by their acclamations that he could
                    depend on them, he reſolved to begin hoſtilities immediately.</p>
                <p>The firſt deſign of Cæſar was to make himſelf maſter of Ariminum, a city
                    bordering upon Ciſalpine Gaul, and conſequently a part of his province ; but as
                    this would be looked upon as a declaration of war, he reſolved to keep his
                    deſign as private as poſſible. At that time he himſelf was at Ravenna, from
                    whence he ſent a detachment towards the Rubicon, deſiring the officer who
                    commanded it to wait for him on the banks of that river. The next day he
                    aſſiſted at a ſhow of gladiators, and made a great entertainment. Towards the
                    cloſe of the day he roſe from table, deſiring his gueſts to ſtay till he came
                    back, which he ſaid would be very ſoon ; but, inſtead of returning to the
                    company, he immediately ſet out for the Rubicon, having left orders to ſome of
                    his moſt intimate friends to follow him through different roads, to avoid being
                    obſerved. Having arrived at the Rubicon, which parted Ciſalpine Gaul from Italy,
                    the ſucceeding misfortunes of the empire occurred to his mind, and made him
                    heſitate. Turning then to Aſinius Pollio, “ If I do not croſs the river (ſaid
                    he),</p>
                <p>I am undone ; and if I do croſs it, how many calamities ſhall I by this means
                    bring upon Rome !” Having thus ſpoken, he muſed a few minutes ; and then crying
                    out, ** The die is caſt,” he threw himſelf into the river, and croſſing it,
                    marched with all poſſible ſpeed to Ariminum, which he reached and ſurpriſed
                    before daybreak- From thence, as he had but one legion with him, he diſpatched
                    orders to the formidable army he had left in Gaul to croſs the mountains and
                    join him.</p>
                <p>The activity of Cæſar ſtruck the oppoſite party with the greateſt terror ; and
                    indeed not without reaſon, for they had been extremely negligent in making
                    preparations againſt ſuch a formidable opponent. Pompey himſelf, no leſs alarmed
                    than the reſt, left Rome with a deſicrn to retire to Capua, where he had two
                    legions whom he had formerly draughted out of Cæſar’s army. He communicated his
                    intended flight to the ſenate ; but at the ſame time acquainted them, that if
                    any magiſtrate or ſenator refuſed to follow him, he ſhould be treated as a
                    friend to Cæſar and an enemy to his country. In the mean time Cæſar, having
                    raiſed new troops in Ciſalpine Gaul, ſent Marc Antony with a detachment to ſeize
                    Aretium, and ſome other officers to ſecure Piſaurum and Fanum, while he himſelf
                    marched at the head of the thirteenth legion to Auximum, which opened its gates
                    to him. From Auximum he advanced into Pi-cenum, where he was joined by the
                    twelfth legion ſrom Tranſalpine Gaul. As Picenum readily ſubmitted to him, he
                    led his forces againſt Corfinium, the capital of the Peligni, which Domitus
                    Ahenobarbus defended with thirty cohorts. But Cæſar no ſooner inveſted it, than
                    the garriſon betrayed their commander, and delivered him up with many ſenators,
                    who had taken refuge in the place, to Cæſar, who granted them their lives and
                    liberty. Domitius, fearing the reſentment of the cortqueror, had ordered one of
                    his ſlaves, whom he uſed as a phyſician, to give him a doſe of poiſon. When he
                    came to experience the humanity of the conqueror, he lamented his misfortune,
                    and blamed the haſtineſs of his own reſolution. But his phyſician, who had only
                    given him a ſleeping draught, comforted him, and received his liberty as a
                    reward for his affection.</p>
                <p>Pompey, thinking himſelf no longer ſafe at Capua after the reduction of
                    Corfinium, retired to Brundu-ſium, with a deſign to carry the war into the eaſt,
                    where all the governors were his creatures. Cæſar followed him cloſe ; and
                    arriving with his army before Brunduſium, inveſted the place on the land-ſide,
                    and undertook to ſhut up the port by a ſtaccado of his own invention. But,
                    before the work was completed, the fleet which had conveyed the two conſuls with
                    thirty cohorts to Dyrrhachium being returned, Pompey reſolved to make liis
                    eſcape, which he conducted with all the experience and dexterity of a great
                    officer. He kept his departure very ſecret ; but, at the ſame time, made all
                    neceſſary preparations for the facilitating of it. In the firſt place, he walled
                    up the gates, then dug deep and wide ditches croſs all the ſtreets, except only
                    thoſe two that led to the port ; in the ditches he planted iharp pointed ſtakes,
                    covering them with hurdles and earth. After theſe precautions, he gave expreſs
                    orders that all the citizens ſhould keep within doors, leſt they ſhould betray
                    his deſign to the enemy ; and then, in the ſpace of three days, embarked all his
                    troops, except the light-armed infantry, whom he had placed on the walls ; and
                    theſe likewiſe, on a ſignal given, abandoning their poſts, repaired with great
                    expedition to the ſhips. Cæſar, perceiving the walls unguarded, ordered his men
                    to ſcale them, and make what haſte they could after the enemy. In the heat of
                    the purſuit, they would have fallen into the ditches which Pompey had prepared
                    for them, had not the Brunduſians warned them of the danger, and, by many
                    windings and turnings, led them to the haven, where they ſound all the fleet
                    under ſail, except two veſſels, which had run aground in going out of the
                    harbour. Theſe Cæſar took, made the ſoldiers on board priſoners, and brought
                    them aſhore.</p>
                <p>Cæſar, ſeeing himſelf, by the flight of his rival, mat ter of all Italy from the
                    Alps to the ſea, was deſirous to follow and attack him before he was joined by
                    the ſupplies which he expected from Aſia. But being deſtitute of ſhipping, he
                    reſolved to. go firſt to Rome, and ſettle ſome ſort of government there ; and
                    then paſs in-to Spain, to drive from thence Pompey’s troops, who had taken
                    poſſeſſion of that great continent, Under the command of Afranius and Petreius.
                    Before he left Brunduſium, he ſent Scribonius Curio with three legions into
                    Sicily, and ordered Q <hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="sub"> λ</hi></hi> Valerius, one of his lieutenants, to get together what ſhips he could, and
                    croſs over with one legion into Sardinia. Cato, who commanded in Sicily, upon
                    the firſt news of Curio’s landing there, abandoned the iſland, and retired to
                    the camp of the conſuls at Dyrrhachium ; and Valerius no ſooner appeared with
                    his ſmall fleet off Sardinia,</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0379" facs="gri_33125011196389_0385.tif"/>
                <p>than the Caralitini, now the inhabitants of Cagliari, drove out Aurelius Cotta,
                    who commanded there for the ſenate, and put Cæſar’s lieutenant in poſſeſſion
                    both of their city and iſland.</p>
                <p>In the mean time the general himſelſ advanced towards Rome ; and on his march
                    wrote to all the ſenators then in Italy, deſiring them to repair to the capital,
                    and aſſiſt him with their counſel. Above all, he was deſirous to ſee Cicero ;
                    but could not prevail upon him to return to Rome. As Cæſar drew near the
                    capital, he quartered his troops in the neighbouring mu-nicipia ; and then
                    advancing to the city, out of a pretended reſpect to the ancient cuſtoms, he
                    took up his quarters in the ſuburbs, whether the whole city crowded to ſee the
                    famous conqueror of Gaul, who had been abſent near ten years. And now ſuch of
                    the tribunes of the people as had fled to him for refuge reaſſumed their
                    functions, mounted the roſtra, and endeavoured by their ſpeeches to reconcile
                    the people to the head of their party. Marc Antony particularly, and' Caſſius
                    Longinus, two of Cæſar’s moſt zealous partiſans, moved that the ſenate ſhould
                    meet in the ſuburbs, that the general might give them an account of his conduct.
                    Accordingly, ſuch of the ſenators as were at Rome aſſembled ; when Cæſar made a
                    ſpeech in juſtiſication of all his proceedings, and concluded his harangue with
                    pro-pofing a deputation to Pompey, with offers of an accommodation in an
                    amicable manner. He even deſired the conſcript fathers, to whom in appearance he
                    paid great deference, to nominate ſome of their venerable body to carry
                    propofals of peace to the conſuls, and the general of the conſular'army ; but
                    none of the ſenators would take upon him that commiſſion. He then began to think
                    of providing himſelf with the neceſſary ſums ſor carrying on the war, and had
                    recourſe to the public treaſury. But Metellus, one of the tribunes, oppoſed him
                    ; alleging a law forbidding any one to open the treaſury, but in the preſence
                    and with the conſent of the conſuls. Cæſar, however, without regarding the
                    tribune, went directly to the temple of Saturn, where the public money was kept.
                    But the keys of the treaſury having been carried away by the conſul Lentulus, he
                    ordered the doors to be broken open. This Metellus oppoſed : but Cæſar, in a
                    paſſion, laying his hand on his ſword, threatened to kill him if he gave him any
                    farther diſturbance ; which ſo terrified Metellus, that he withdrew. Cæſar took
                    out of the treaſury, which was ever after at his command, an immenſe ſum ;
                    fς&gt;me ſay, 300,000 pounds weight of gold. With this ſupply of money he
                    raiſed troops all over Italy, and ſent governors into all the provinces ſubject
                    to the republic.</p>
                <p>Cæſar now made Marc Antony commander in chief of the armies in Italy, ſent his
                    brother C. Antonins to govern Illyricum, aſſigned Ciſalpine Gaul to Licinius
                    Craſſus, appointed M. Æmilius Lepidus governor of the capital ; and having got
                    together ſome ſhips to cruiſe in the Adriatic and Mediterranean ſeas, he gave
                    the command of one of his fleets to P. Cornelius Dolabella, and of the other to
                    young Hortenſins, the ſon of the famous orator. As Pompey had ſent governors
                    into the ſame provinces, by this means a general war was kindled in almoſt all
                    the parts of the known world. However, Cæſar would not truſt any of his
                    lieutenants with the conduct of the war in Spain, which was Pompey’s favourite
                    province, but took it upon himſelf ; and having ſettled his affairs in great
                    haſte at Rome, returned to Ariminum, aſſembled his legions there, and paſſing
                    the Alps, entered Tranſalpine Gaul. There he was informed that the inhabitants
                    of Marſeilles had reſolved to refuſe him entrance into their city ; and that L.
                    Domitius Ahenobarbus, whom he had generouſly pardoned and ſet at liberty after
                    the reduction of Corfinium, had ſet ſail for Marſeilles with ſeven galleys,
                    having on board a great number of his clients and ſlaves, with a deſign to raiſe
                    the city in favour of Pompey. Cæſar, thinking it dangerous to let the enemy take
                    poſſeſſion of ſuch an important place, ſent for the 15 chief magiſtrates of the
                    city, and adviſed them not to begin a war with him, but rather follow the
                    example of Italy, and ſubmit. The magiſtrates returned to the city, and ſoon
                    after informed him that they were to ſtand neuter ; but in the mean time
                    Domitius arriving with his ſmall ſquadron, was received into the city, and
                    declared general of all their forces. Hereupon Cæſar immediately inveſted the
                    town with three legions, and ordered twelve galleys to be built at Arelas, now <hi rend="italic">Arles,</hi> in order to block up the port. But as the
                    ſiege was like to detain him too long, he left C. Trebonius to carry it on, and
                    D. Brutus to command the fleet, while he continued his march into Spain, where
                    he began the war with all the valour, ability, and ſucceſs of a great general.
                    Pompey had three generals in this continent, which was divided into two Roman
                    provinces. V;ſrro commanded in Farther Spain ; and Petreius and Afranius, with
                    equal power, and two conſiderable armies, in Hither Spain. Cæſar, while he was
                    yet at,Marſeilles, ſent Q. Fabius, one of his lieutenants, with three legions,
                    to take poſſeſſion of the paſſes of the Pyrenees, which Afranius had ſeized.
                    Fabius executed his commiſſion with great bravery, entered Spain, and left the
                    way open for Cæſar, who quickly followed him. As ſoon as he had croſſed the
                    mountains, he ſent out ſcouts to obſerve the ſituation of the enemy ; by whom he
                    was informed, that Afranius and Petreius having joined their forces, conſiſting
                    of five legions, 20 cohorts of the natives, and 5000 horſe, were advantageouſly
                    poſted on an hill of a¾ eaſy aſcent in the neighbourhood of Ilerda, now <hi
                        rend="italic"> Lerida <hi rend="sub">t</hi></hi> in Catalonia. Upon this advice Cæſar advanced within light of the enemy,
                    and encamped in a plain between the Sicoris and Cinga, now the <hi rend="italic"
                        > Sεgro</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cincα.</hi> Between the eminence on
                    which Afranius had poſted himſelf, and the city of Ilerda, was a ſmall plain,
                    and in the middle of it a riſing ground, which Cæſfar attempted to ſeize, in
                    order to cut off by that means the communication between the enemy’s camp and
                    the city, from whence they had all their proviſions. This occaſioned a iharp
                    diſpute between three of Cæſar’s legions and an equal number of the enemy, which
                    laſted five hours with equal ſucceſs, both parties claiming the victory. But
                    after all, Afranius’s men, who had firſt ſeized the poſt, maintained themſelves
                    in poſſeſſion of it in ſpite of Cæſar’s utmoſt efforts. Two days after this
                    battle, continual rains, with the melting of the ſnow on the mountains, ſo
                    ſwelled the two rivers between which Cæſar was encamped, that they overflowed,
                    broke down his bridges, and laid under water the neighbouring country to a great
                    diſtance. ſhis cut off the communication between his camp and the cities tlrat
                    had declared for him ; and reduced him to ſuch ſtraits, that his army was ready

                    the ſtream rendering all his endeavours fruitleſs.</p>
                <p>Upon the news of Cæſar’s diſtreſs, Pompey’s party at Rome began to .take
                    courage. Several perſons of diſtinction went to congratulate Afranius’s wiſe on
                    the ſucceſs of her huſhand’s arms in Spain. Many of the ſenators who had
                    hitherto ſtood neuter, haſtened to Pompey’s camp, taking it for granted that
                    Cæſar was reduced to the laſt extremity, and all hopes of his party loſt. Of
                    this number was Cicero ; who, without any regard to the remonſlrances of
                    Atticus, or the letters Cæſar himſelf wrote to him, deſiring him to join neither
                    party, he leſt Italy, and landed at Dyrrhachium, where Pompey received him with
                    great marks of joy and friendſhip. -But. the joy of pompey’s party was not
                    long-lived. For Cæſar, after having attempted ſeveral times in vain to rebuild
                    his bridges, cauſed boats to be made with all poſſible expedition ; and while
                    the enemy were diverted by endeavouring to intercept the ſuccours that were ſent
                    him from Gaul, he laid hold of that opportunity to convey his boats in the night
                    on carriages 22 miles from his camp ; where with wonderful quickneſs a great
                    detachment paſſed the Sicoris, and encamping on the oppoſite bank unknown to the
                    enemy, built a bridge in two days, opened a communication with the neighbouring
                    country, received the ſupplies ſrom Gaul, and relieved the wants of his
                    ſoldiers. Cæſar being thus delivered from danger, purſued the armies of Afranius
                    and Petreius with inch ſuperior addreſs and conduct, that he forced them to
                    ſub-mſt without coming to a battle, and by that means became maſter of all
                    Hither Spain. The two generals diſhanded their troops, ſent them out of the
                    province, and returned to Italy, after having ſolemnly promiſed never to
                    aſſemble forces again, or make war upon Cæſar. Upon the news of the reduction of
                    Hither Spain, the Spaniards in Farther Spain, and one Roman legion, deſerted
                    from Varro, Pompey’s governor in that province, which obliged him to ſurrender
                    his other legion and all his,.money.</p>
                <p>Cæſar having thus reduced all Spain in a few months, appointed Caſſius Longinus
                    to govern the two provinces with four legions, and then returned to Marſeilles ;
                    which city was juſt upon the point of ſurrendering after a moſt vigorous
                    reſiſtance. Though the inhabitants had by their late treachery deſerved a ſevere
                    puniſhment, yet he granted them their lives and liberty ; but ſtripped their
                    arſenals of arms, and obliged them to deliver up «11 their ſhips.. From
                    Marſeilles Cæſar marched into Ciſalpine Gaul ; and from thence haſtened to Rome,
                    where he laid the foundation of his future grandeur. He found the city in a very
                    different ſtate from that in which he had left it. Moſt of the ſenators and
                    magiſtrates were fled to Pompey at Dyrrhachiυm. However, there were ſtill
                    prætors there ; and among them M. Æmilius Lepidus, who was afterwards one of the
                    triumvirs with Octavius and Marc Antony. The præ-tor, to ingratiate himſelf with
                    Cæſar, nominated him dictator of his own authority, and againſt the inclination
                    of the ſenate. Cæſar accepted the new dignity but neither abuſed his power, as
                    Sylla had done, nor retained it ſo long. During the 11 days of his dictate!
                    ſhip, he governed with great moderation, and gained the affections both of the
                    people and tlrt patricians. He recalled the exiles, granted the rights and
                    privileges of Roman citizens to all the Gauls beyond the Po, and, as pontifex
                    maximus, filled up the vacancies of the ſa, cerdotal colleges with his own
                    friends. Though it was expected that he would have abſolutely cancelled all
                    debts contracted ſince the beginning of the troubles, he only reduced the
                    intereſt to one-fourth. But the chief uſe he made of his dictatorſhip was to
                    preſide at the election of conſuls for the next year, when he got himſelf, and
                    Servilius Iſauricus, one of his moſt zealous par-tilans, promoted to that
                    dignity.</p>
                <p>And now being reſolved to follow Pompey, and carry the war into the eaſt, he ſet
                    out for Brunduſium, whither he had ordered 12 leg∙ons to repair with all
                    poſſible expedition. But on his arrival he found only five there. The reſt,
                    being afraid of the dangers of the ſea, and unwilling to engage in a new war,
                    had marched leiſurely, complaining of their general for allowing them no
                    reſpite, but hurrying them continually from one country to another. However,
                    Cæſar did not wait for them, but ſet ſail with only five legions and 600 horſe
                    iu the beginning of January. While the reſt were waiting at Brunduſium for ſhips
                    to tranſport them over into E-pirus, Cæſar arrived ſafe with his five legions in
                    Chao-nia, the northern part of Epirus, near the Ceraunian mountains. There he
                    landed his troops, and ſent the ſhips back to Brunduſium to bring over the
                    legions that were left behind. The war he was now entering upon was the moſt
                    difficult he had yet undertaken. Pompey had for a whole year been aſſembling
                    troops from all the eaſtern countries. When he left Italy, he had only live
                    legions ; but ſince his arrival at Dyrrhachium he had been reinforced with one
                    from Sicily, another ſrom Crete, and two from Syria. Three thouſand archers, ſix
                    cohorts of flingers, and ſeven thouſand horſe, had been ſent him by princes in
                    alliance with Rome. All the free cities of Alia had reinforced his army with
                    their beſt troops ; nay, if we give credit to an hiſtorical poet, ſuccours were
                    brought him from the Indus and the Ganges to the eaſt, and from Arabia and
                    Ethiopia to the ſouth ; at leaſt it is certain, that Greece, Aſia Minor, Syria,
                    Paleſtine, Egypt, and all the nations ſrom the Mediterranean to the Euphrates,
                    took up aι ms in his favour. He had almoſt all the Roman knights, that is, the
                    flower of the young nobility, in his lqua∙ drons, and his legions conſiſted
                    moſtly of veterans inured to dangers and the toils of war. Pompey himſelf was a
                    general of great experience and addreſs ; and had under him ſome of the beſt
                    commanders of the republic, who had formerly conducted armies themſelves. As for
                    his navy, he had above 500 ſhips of war, beſides a far greater number of ſmall
                    veſtels, which were continually cruiſing on the coaſts, and intercepted ſuch
                    ſhips as carried arms or proviſions to the enemy. He had likewiſe with him above
                    2c0 ſenators, who formed a more numerous ſenate than that at Rome. Cornelius
                    Lentulus and Claudius Marcellus, the laſt year’s conſuls, preſided in it ; but
                    under the direction of Pompey their protector, who ordered them to aſſemble at
                    Theſ-ſalonica, where he built a ſtately hall for that purpoſe. There, in one of
                    their aſſemblies, ,at the motion of Cato, it was decreed, that no Roman citizen
                    ſhould be put to death but in battle, and that no city ſubject to the republic
                    ſhould be lacked.. At the ſame tune the</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0381" facs="gri_33125011196389_0387.tif"/>
                <p>eqnſeript fathers aſſembled at Theſſalonſea decreed, that they alone repreſented
                    the Roman ſenate, and that thoſe who reſided at Rome were encouragers of
                    tyranny, and friends to the tyrant. And indeed, as the flower of the nobility
                    was with Pompey, and the moſt virtuous men in the republic had taken refuge in
                    his camp, he was generally looked upon as the only hope and ſupport of the
                    public liberty. Hence many perſons- of eminent probity, who had hitherto ſtood
                    neuter, flocked to him from all parts. Anlong theſe were young Brutus, who
                    afterwards conſpired againſt Cæſar, Tidius Sextius, and Labienus. Brutus, whoſe
                    father had been put to death in Galatia by Pompey’s order, had never ſpoken to
                    him, or ſo much as ſaluted him ſince that time : but as he now looked upon him
                    as the defender of the public liberty, he joined him, ſacriſicing therein his
                    private reſentment to the intereſt of the public. Pompey received him with great
                    joy, and was willing to confer upon him ſome command ; but he declined the
                    offer. Tidius Sextius, though extremely old and lame, yet left Rome, and went as
                    far as Macedonia to join Pompey there. Labienus likewiſe forſook his old
                    benefactor, under whom he had ſerved during the whole courſe of the Gauliſh war,
                    and went over to his rival, though Cæſar had appointed him commander in chief of
                    all the forces on the other ſide the Alps. Tn ſhort, Pompey’s partv grew into
                    ſuch reputation, that his cauſe was generally called the <hi rend="italic">good
                        envle,</hi> while Cæſar’s adherents were looked upon as enemies to their
                    country, and abettors of tyranny.</p>
                <p>As ſoon as Cæſar landed, he marched directly .to Oricurn, the neareſt city in
                    Epirus, which was taken without oppoſition, The like ſucceſs attended him at
                    Apollonia, which was in no condition to ſtanda ſiege ; and theſe two conqueſts
                    opened a way to Dyrrhachium, where Pompey had his magazines of arms and
                    proviſions. This ſucceſs, however, was interrupted by the news that the fleet
                    which he had ſent back to Brunduſium to tranſport the reſt of his troops had
                    been attacked by Bibulus, one of Pompey’s admirals, who had taken 30, and
                    inhumanly burnt them with the ſeamen on board. This gave Cæſar great uneaſineſs,
                    eſpecially as he heard that Bibulus, with 1 10 ſhips of war, had taken
                    poſſeſſion of all the harbours between Salonium and Oricurn ; ſo that the
                    legions at Brunduſium could not venture to croſs the ſea without great danger of
                    falling into the enemy’s hands. By this Cæſar was ſo much embarraſſed, that he
                    made propoſals of accommodation upon very moderate terms ; being no other than
                    that both Pompey and he ſhould diſhand their armies within three days, renew
                    their former friendſhip with ſolemn oaths, and return together to Italy. Theſe
                    propoſals were ſent by Vibullius Rufus, an intimate ſriend of Pompey, whom Cæſar
                    had twice taken priſoner. Pompey, however, probably elated with his late good
                    fortune, anſwered that he would not hearken to any terms, leſt it ſhould be ſaid
                    that he owed his liſe and return to Italy to Cæſar’s ſavour. However, the latter
                    again ſent one Vatinius to confer with Pompey about a treaty of peace. Labienus
                    was appointed to receive the propoſals ; but while they were conferring
                    together, a party of Pompey’s men coming up to them, diſeharged their darts at
                    Vatinius and thoſe who attended him. Some of the guards were wounded, and
                    Vatinius narrowly eſeaped with his life«·</p>
                <p>In the jnean time Cæſar advanced towards Dyrrhachium, in hopes of ſurpriſing
                    that important place ; but Pompey unexpectedly appearing, he halted on the other
                    ſide of the river Aρ.us, where he intrenched himſelf, as having but a ſmall
                    number of troops in com· pariſon of the formidable army which attended Pompey.
                    The Utter, however, notwithſtanding his ſuperiority, durſt not croſs the river
                    in Cæſar s light; ſo that the two armies continued for ſome time quiet in their
                    reſpective camps. Cæſar wrote letter after letter to· Marc Antony, who commanded
                    the legions he had left in Italy, to come to his aſſiſtance; but receiving no
                    anſwer, Cæſar diſguiſed himſelf in the habit of a ſlave, and with all imaginable
                    ſecrecy went on board a ſiſher-man’s bark, with a deſign to go over to
                    Brunduſium, though the enemy’s fleet was cruiſing on the coaſts both of Greece
                    and Italy. This deſign, however, miſcarried, by reaſon of the boat being put
                    back by contrary winds; and thus Cæſar was reſtored to his ſoldiers, who had
                    been very uneaſy at his abſence. He was no ſooner landed than he diſpatched
                    Poſthumius, one of his lieutenants, with moſt preſſing orders to Marc Antony,
                    Gabinius, and Calenus, to bring the troops to him at all adventures. Gabinius,
                    unwilling to expoſe all the hopes of his general to the hazards of the ſea,
                    thought it ſafer to march a great way about by Illyricum, and therefore engaged
                    all the legionaries he could to follow him by land. But the Illyrians, who had,
                    unknown to him, declared for Pompey, fell unexpectedly upon him and killed him
                    and his men, not one eſcaping. Marc Antony and Calenus, who went by ſea, were in
                    the greateſt danger from one of Pompey's∙ admirals ; but had the good luck to
                    bring their troops ſafe to ſhore at Nyphæum, in the neighbourhood of Apollonia.
                    As loon as it was known that Antony was landed, Po n-pey marched to prevent his
                    joining Cæſar. On the other hand, Cæſar inſtantly de&lt;,kimped, and
                    haſtening to the relief of his lieutenant, joined him before Pompey came up.
                    Then Pompey,, not caring to engage them when united, retired to an advantageous
                    poſt in the neighbourhood of Dyrrhachium, known by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                        > Aſparagium</hi> , and there encamped. Cæſar having thus at length got all
                    his troops together, reſolved to finiſh the war by one general action, and
                    determine the fate of the world, either by his own death or by that of his
                    rival. To this end he offered Pompey battle, and kept his army a great while
                    drawn up in light of the enemy. But Pompey declining an engagement, he decamped,
                    and turned towards Dyrrhachium, as if he deſigned to ſur</p>
                <p>priſe it, hoping by this means to draw Pompey into the plain. But Pompey,
                    looking upon the taking of Dyrrhachium as a chimerical project, followed Cæſar
                    at ſome diſtance, and letting him draw near to the city, encamped on a hill
                    called <hi rend="italic">Petra,</hi> which commanded the ſea, whence he could
                    be ſupplied with proviſions ſrom Greece and Aſia, while Cæſar was forced to
                    bring corn by land from Epirus, at a vaſt expence, and· through many dangers.</p>
                <p>This inconvenience put Cæſar upon a new deſign, which was to ſurround an army
                    far more numerous than his own, and, by {hutting them up within a narrow tract
                    of ground, diſtreſs them as much ſor want of forage as his troops were
                    diſtreſſed for want of corn. Pu-ſuant to this deſign, be drew a line of
                    circιιmvalla-tion from the ſea quite round Pompey’s camp, and kept</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0382" facs="gri_33125011196389_0388.tif"/>
                <p>him ſo cloſely blocked up, that though his men were plentifully ſupplied with
                    proviſions by ſea, yet the horſes of his army began ſoon to die in great numbers
                    for want of forage. Cæſar’s men, though in the utmoſt diſtreſs for want of corn,
                    yet bore all with’ incredible cheerfulneſs ; proteſting, that they would rather
                    live upon the bark of trees than ſuffer Pompey to eſcape, now they had him in
                    their power. Cæſar tells us, that in this extremity ſuch of the army as had been
                    in Sardinia ſound out the way of making bread of a certain root called <hi
                        rend="italic"> citera,</hi> which they ſteeped in milk ; and that when the
                    enemy inſulted them on account of the ſtar-ving condition which they were in,
                    they threw ſeveral of theſe loaves among them, to put them out of all hopes of
                    ſubduing them by famine. “ So long as the earth produces ſuch roots (ſaid they),
                    we will not let Pompey eſcape.” At length Pompey, alarmed at the diſtempers
                    which began to prevail in his army, made ſeveral attempts to break through the
                    barriers that incloſed him, but was always repulſed with loſs. At length, being
                    reduced to the utmoſt extremity for want of forage, he reſolved at all events to
                    force the enemy’s lines and eſcape. With the aſſiſtance, therefore, and by the
                    advice of two deſerters, he embarked his archers, ſlingers, and light-armed
                    infantry, and marching himſelf by land at the head of 60 cohorts, went to attack
                    that part of Cæſar’s lines which was next to the ſea, and not yet quite
                    finiſhed. He ſet out from his camp in the dead of the night, and arriving at the
                    poſt he deſigned to force by break of day, he began the attack by ſea and land
                    at the ſame time. The ninth legion, which defended that part of the lines, made
                    for ſome time a vigorous reſiſtance ; but being attacked in the rear by Pompey’s
                    men, who came by ſea, and landed between Cæſar’s two lines, they fled with ſuch
                    precipitation, that the ſuccours Marcellinus ſent them ſrom a neighbouring poſt
                    could not ſtop them. The enſign who carried the eagle at the head -of the routed
                    legion was mortally wounded ; but nevertheleſs, before he died, had preſence of
                    mind enough to conſign the eagle to the cavalry of the party, deſiring them to
                    deliver it to Cæſar. Pompey’s men purſued the fugitives, and made ſuch a
                    ſlaughter of them, that all the centurions of the firſt cohort were cut off
                    except one. And now Pompey’s army broke in like a torrent upon the poſts Cæſar
                    had fortified, and were advancing to attack Mar-cellinus, who guarded a
                    neighbouring fort ; but Marc Antony coming very ſeaſonably to his relief with 12
                    cohorts, they thought it adviſable to retire.</p>
                <p>Soon after Cæſar himſelf arrived with a ſtrong reinforcement, and poſted himſelf
                    on the ſhore, in order to prevent ſuch attempts ſor the future. From this poſt
                    he obſerved an old camp which he had made within the place where Pompey was
                    incloſed, but afterwards abandoned. Upon his quitting <hi rend="italic">it,</hi> Pompey had taken poſſeſſion of it, and left a legion to guard it. This
                    poſt Cæſar reſolved to reduce, hoping to repair the loſs he had ſuſtained on
                    this unfortunate day, by taking the legion which Pompey had poſted there.
                    Accordingly, lie advanced ſecretly at the head of 33 cohorts in two lines : and
                    arriving at the old camp before Pompey could have notice of his march, attacked
                    it with great vigour, forced the firſt intrenchment, notwithſtanding the brave
                    reſiſtance of Titus Pulcio, and penetrated to the ſecond, whither the legion had
                    retired. But here</p>
                <p>his fortune changed on a ſudden. His right wing, in looking for an entrance into
                    the camp, marched along the outſide of a trench which Cæſar had formerly carried
                    on from the left angle of his camp, about 400 paces, to a neighbouring river.
                    This trench they miſ-toök for the rampart of the camp ; and being led away by
                    that miſtake from their leſt wing, they were ſoon after prevented from rejoining
                    it by the arrival of Pompey, who came up at the head of a legion and a large
                    body of horſe. Then the legion which Cæſar had attacked taking courage, made a
                    briſk ſally, drove his men back to the firſt intrenchment which they had ſeized,
                    and there put them in gιeat diſorder while they were attempting to paſs the
                    ditch. Pompey, in the mean time, falling upon them with his cavalry in flank,
                    completed their defeat ; and then flying to the enemy’s right wing, which had
                    paſſed the trench mentioned above, and was ſhut up between that and the ramparts
                    of the old camp, made a moſt dreadful ſlaughter of them. The trench was filled
                    with dead bodies, many falling into it in that diſorder, and others paſſing over
                    them and preſſing them to death.</p>
                <p>In this diſtreſs, Cæſar did all he could to ſtop the flight of his legionaries,
                    but to no purpoſe: the ſtan-dard-bearers themſelves threw down the Roman eagles
                    when Cæſar endeavoured to ſtop them, and left them in the hands of the enemy,
                    who on this occaſion took 32 ſtandards ; a diſgrace which Cæſar had never
                    ſuffered before. He was himſelf in no ſmall danger of faffing by the hand of one
                    of his own men, whom he took hold of when flying, bidding him ſtand and face
                    about ; but the man, apprehenfιve of the danger he was in, drew his ſword, and
                    would have killed him, had not one of his guards prevented the blow by cutting
                    oſſhifi arm. Cæſar loſt on this occafιon 960 of his foot, 400 of his horſe, 5
                    tribunes, and 32 centurions.</p>
                <p>This loſs and diſgrace greatly mortified Cæſar, but did not diſcourage him.
                    After he had by his lenity and eloquent ſpeeches recovered the ſpirit of his
                    troops, he decamped, and retired in good order to Apollonia, where he paid the
                    army, and left his ſick and wounded. From thence he marched into Macedon, where
                    Scipio Metellus, Pompey’s father-in-law, was encamped. He hoped either to draw
                    his rival into ſome plain, or to overpower Scipio <hi rend="italic">if</hi> not aſſiſted. Pie met with great difficulties on his march, the countries
                    through which he paſſed refuſing to ſupply his army with proviſions ; to ſuch a
                    degree was his reputation ſunk ſince his lait defeat ! On his entering Theſſaly
                    he was met by Domitius, one of his lieutenants, whom he had ſent with three
                    legions to reduce Epirus. Having now got all his forces together, he marched
                    directly to Gomphi, the firſt town of Theſſaly, which had been formerly in his
                    intereſt, but now declared againſt him. Whereupon he attacked it with ſo much
                    vigour, that though the garriſon was very numerous, and the waffs were of an
                    uncommon height, he made himſelf maſter of it in a few hours. From hence he
                    matched to Metropolis, another conſiderable town of Theſſaly, which immediately
                    ſurrendered ; as did all the other cities of the country, except Lai iſſa, of
                    which Scipio had made himſelf maſter.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, Pompey being continually importuned by the ſenators and
                    officers of his army, left his camp at Dyrrhachium, anti followed Cæſar, firmly</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0383" facs="gri_33125011196389_0389.tif"/>
                <p>reſolved not to give him battle, but rather to diſtreſs him by keeping cloſe at
                    his heels, ſtraitening his quarters, and cutting off his convoys. As he had
                    frequent opportunities of coming to an engagement, but always declined it, his
                    friends and ſubalterna began to put ill conſtructions on his dilatorineſs to his
                    face.</p>
                <p>Theſe, together with the complaints of his ſoldiers, made him at length reſolve
                    to venture a general action. With this deſign he marched into a large plain near
                    the cities of Pharſalia and Thebes ; which latter was alſo called <hi
                        rend="italic"> Philippi,</hi> from Philip king of Macedon, and the father
                    of Perſes, who, having reduced the Thebans, placed a colony of Macedonians in
                    their city. This plain was watered by the Enipeus, and ſurrounded on all ſides
                    by high mountains ; and Pompey, who was ſtill averſe from venturing an
                    engagement, pitched his camp on the declivity of a ſteep mountain, in a place
                    altogether inacceſſible. There he was joined by Scipio his father-in-law, at the
                    head of the legions which he had brought with him from Syria and Cilicia. But
                    notwithſtanding this reinforcement, he continued irre-ſolute, and unwilling to
                    put all to the iſſue of a ſingle action ; being ſtill convinced of the wiſdom of
                    his maxim, that it was better to deſtroy the enemy by fatigues and want, than to
                    engage an army of brave veterans, who were in a manner reduced to deſpair. As he
                    put off from day to day, under various pretences, deſcending into the plain
                    where Cæſar was encamped, his officers forced him to call a council of war, when
                    all to a man. were for venturing a general action the very next day. Thus was
                    Pompey obliged to ſacriſice his own judgment to the blind ardour of the
                    multitude ; and the neceſſary meaſures were taken for a general engagement.</p>
                <p>The event of this battle was in the higheſt degree fortunate for Cæſar j- ; who
                    reſolved to purſue his advantage, and follow Pompey to whatever country he
                    ſhould retire. Hearing, therefore, of his being at Am-phipolis, he ſent off his
                    troops before him, and then embarked on board a little frigate in order to croſs
                    the Helleſpont ; but in the middle of the ſtrait, he ſell in with one of
                    Pompey’s commanders, at the head of ten ſhips of war. Cæſar, noway terrified at
                    the ſuperiority of his force, bore up to him, and commanded him to ſubmit. The
                    other inſtantly obeyed, awed by the terror of Cæſar’s name, and ſurrendered
                    himſelf and his fleet at diſcretion.</p>
                <p>From thence he continued his voyage to Epheſus, then to Rhodes ; and being
                    informed that Pompey had been there before him, he made no doubt but that he was
                    fled to Egypt ; wherefore,, lofing no time, he ſet ſail for that kingdom, and
                    arrived at Alexandria with about 4000 men ; a very inconſiderable force to keep
                    ſuch a powerful kingdom under ſubjection. But he was now grown ſo ſecure in his
                    good fortune, that he expected to find obedience everywhere. Upon his landing,
                    the firſt accounts he received were of Pompey’s miſerable end, who had been
                    aſſaſſinated by orders of the treacherous king as ſoon as he went on ſhore ; and
                    ſoon after one of the murderers came with his head and ring as a moſt grateful
                    preſent to the conqueror. But Cæſar turned away from it with horror, and ſhortly
                    after ordered a magnificent tomb to be built to his memory on The ſpot where he
                    was murdered ; and a temple near the place, to Nemeſis, who was the goddeſs</p>
                <p>that puniſhed thoſe that were cruel to men in adverſity.</p>
                <p>It ſhould ſeem that the Egyptians by this time had ſome hopes of breaking off
                    all alliance with the Ro·» naans ; which they conſidered, as in fact it was, but
                    a ſpecious ſubjection. They firſt began to take offence at Cæſar’s carrying the
                    enſigns of Roman power before him as he entered the city. Photinus, the eunuch,
                    alſo treated him with diſreſpect, and even attempted his liſe. Cæſar, however,
                    concealed his reſentment till he had a force ſufficient to puniſh his treachery
                    ; and ſending privately for the legions which had been formerly enrolled for
                    Pompey’s ſervice, as being the neareſſ to E-gypt, he in the mean time pretended
                    to repoſe an entire conſidence in the king’s minifter. However, he ſoon changed
                    his manner when he found himſelf in no danger from his attempts ; and declared,
                    that, as being a Roman conſul, it was his duty to ſettle the ſucceſſion to the
                    Egyptian crown.</p>
                <p>There were at that time two pretenders to the crown of Egypt : Ptolemy, the
                    acknowledged king ; and the celebrated Cleopatra his ſiſſer ; who, by the cuftom
                    of the country, was alſo his wiſe, and, by their father’s will, ſliared jointly
                    in the ſucceſſion. However, not being contented with a bare participation of
                    power, ſhe aimed at governing alone ; but being oppoſed in her views by the
                    Roman ſenate, who confirmed her brother’s title to the crown, ſhe was banif∩ed
                    into Syria with Ar-ſinoe her younger ſiſter.</p>
                <p>Cæſar, however, gave her new hopes of obtaining the kingdom, and ſent both for
                    her and her brother to plead their cauſe before him. Photinus, the young king’s
                    guardian, who had long borne the moſt inveterate hatred as well to Cæſar as to
                    Cleopatra; diſdained this propoſal, and backed his refuſal by ſending an army of
                    20,000 men to beſiege him in Alexandria. Cæſar bravely repulſed the enemy for
                    ſome time ; but finding the city of too great extent to be defended by
                    ſe&gt; ſmall an army as he then had with him, he retired to the palace,
                    which commanded the harbour, where he purpo-ſed to make a ſtand. Achillas, who
                    commanded the Egyptians, attacked him there with great vigour, and ſtill aimed
                    at making himſelf maſter of the fleet that lay before the palace. Cæſar,
                    however, too well knew the importance of thoſe ſhips in the hands of an enemy ;
                    and therefore burnt them all in ſpite of every effort to prevent it. He next
                    poſſeſſed himſelf of the iſte of Pharos, which was the key to the Alexandrian
                    port, by which he was enabled to receive the ſup. plies ſent him from all ſides
                    ; and in this ſituation he determined to withſtand the united force of all the
                    Egyptians-</p>
                <p>In the mean time, Cleopatra having heard of the preſent turn in her favour,
                    reſolved to depend rather on Cæſar’s favour for gaining the government than her
                    own forces. She had, in fact, aſſembled an army in Syria to ſupport her claims-;
                    but now judged it the wiſeſt way to rely entirely on the deciſion of her
                    ſelf-elected judge. But no arts, as ſhe juſtly conceived, were ſo likely to
                    influence Cæſar, as the charms of her perſon. The difficulty was how to get at
                    Cæſar, as her enemies were in poſſeſſion of all the avenues that led to the
                    palace. For this purpoſe, ſhe went on board a ſmall veſſel, and in the evening
                    landed near the palace j where, being wrapped up in a coverlet, ſhe wa&gt;</p>

                <p>carried by one Aſpolodorus into the very chamber of Cæſar. Her addreſs at firſt
                    pleaſed him ; but her calefies, which were carried beyond the bounds of
                    innocence, entirely brought him over to ſecond her claims.</p>
                <p>While Cleopatra was thus employed in forwarding her own views, her ſiſter Arſmoe
                    was alſo ſtrenuouſly engaged in the, camp in purſuing a ſeparate intereſt. Sire
                    had found means, by the aſſiſtance of one Ganymede her confident, to make a
                    large diviſion in the Egyptian army in her favour ; and ſoon after cauſed
                    Achillas to be murdered, and Ganymede to take the command in his ſtead, and to
                    carry on the ſiege with greater vigour than before. Ganymede’s principal effort
                    was by letting in the ſea upon thoſe canals which ſup-plied the palace with
                    ſreſli water; but this inconvenience Cæſar remedied by digging a great number of
                    wells. His next endeavour was to prevent the junction of Cæſar’s 24th legion,
                    which he twice attempted in vain. He ſoon after made himſelf maſter of a bridge
                    which joined the iſle of Pharos to the continent, from which poſt Cæſar was
                    reſolved to diſlodge him. In the heat of action, ſome mariners came and joined
                    the combatants ; but being ſeized with a panic, inſtantly fled, and ſpread a
                    general terror through the army. All Cæſar’s endeavours to rally his forces were
                    in vain, the confuſion was paſt remedy, and numbers were drowned or put to the
                    ſword in attempting to eſcape; on which, ſeeing the irremediable diſorder of his
                    troops, he retired to a ſhip in order to get to the palace that was juſt
                    oppoſite. However, he was no ſooner on board than great crowds entered at the
                    ſame time with him ; upon which, apprehenſive of the ſhip’s finking, he jumped
                    into the ſea, and ſwam 200 paces to the fleet that lay before the palace.</p>
                <p>The Alexandrians, finding their efforts to take the. palace ineffectual,
                    endeavoured at leaſt to get their king out of Cæſar’s power, as he had ſeized
                    upon his perſen in the beginning of their diſputes. For this purpoſe they made
                    uſe of their cuſtomary arts of diſſimulation, profeſſing the utmoſt deſire for
                    peace, and only wanting the preſence of their lawful prince to give a fonction
                    to the treaty. Cæſar, who was ſenſible of their perfidy, nevertheleſs concealed
                    his ſuſpicions, and gave them their king, as he was under no apprehenſions from
                    the abilities of a boy. Ptolemy, however, the inſtant he was ſet at liberty,
                    inſtead of promoting peace, made every effort to give vigour to hoſtilities.</p>
                <p>In this manner Cæſar was hemmed in ſor ſome time: but he was at laſt relieved
                    from this mortifying ſituation by Mithridates Pergamenus, one of his moſt
                    faithful partizans ; who, collecting a numerous army in Syria, marched into
                    Egypt, took the city of Peluſium, repulſed the Egyptian army with loſs, and at
                    laſt, joining with Cæſar, attacked their camp, and made a great ſtaughter of the
                    Egyptians. Ptolemy himſelf, attempting to eſcape on board a veſſel that was
                    foiling down the river, was drowned by the ſhip’s ſinking ; and Cæſar thus
                    became maſter of all Egypt without any further oppoſition. He therefore
                    appointed, that Cleopatra, with her younger brother, who was then but an infant,
                    ſhould jointly govern, according to the intent of their father’s will ; and
                    drove out Arſinoe with Ganymede into baniſhment.</p>
                <p>Cæſar now for a while ſeemed to relax ſrom the «foal activity of his conduct,
                    captivated with the charms</p>
                <p>of Cleopatra. Inſtead of quitting Egypt to go and quell the remains of Pompey’s
                    party, he abandoned himſelf to, his pleaſures, palling whole nights in feaſts
                    with the young queen. He even reſolved to attend her up the Nile into Ethiopia ;
                    but the brave veterans, who had long followed his fortune, boldly reprehended
                    his conduct, and refuſed to be partners in ſe infomous an expedition. Thus, at
                    length, rouzed from his lethargy, he left Cleopatra, by whom he had a ſon who
                    was afterwards named <hi rend="italic">Ceeſario,</hi> in order to oppoſe
                    Pharnaces the king of Pontus, who had now made ſome inroads upon the dominions
                    of Rome. Here he was attended with the greateſt ſucceſs, as we have related
                    under the article Pontus ; and having ſettled affairs in this part of the
                    empire, as well as time would permit, he embarked for Italy, where he arrived
                    ſooner than his enemies could expect, but not before his affairs there
                    abſolutely required his preſence. He had been, during his abſence, created
                    conſul for five years, dictator for one year, and tribune of the people for
                    life. But Antony, who in the mean time governed in Rome for him, had filled the
                    city with riot and debauchery, and many commotions enſued, which nothing but the
                    arrival of Cæſar could appeaſe. However, by his moderation and humanity, he ſoon
                    reſtored tranquillity to the city, ſcarce making any diſtinction between thoſe
                    of his own and the oppoſite party. Thus having, by gentle means, reſtored his
                    authority at home, he prepared to march into Africa, where Pompey’s party had
                    found time to rally under Scipio and Cato, aſſiſted by Juba king of Mauritania.
                    But the vigour of his proceedings had like to have been retarded by a mutiny in
                    his own ar. my. Thoſe veteran legions, who had hitherto conquered all that came
                    before them, began to murmur for not having received the rewards which they had
                    expected for their paſt ſervices, and now inſiſted upon their diſcharge.
                    However, Cæſar found means to quell the mutiny ; and then, according to his
                    uſual diligence, landed with a ſmall party in Africa, the reſt of the army
                    following ſoon after. After many movements and ikirmiſhes, he reſolved at laſt,
                    to come to a deciſive battle. For this purpoſe he inveſted the city of Tap-ſus,
                    ſuppoſing that Scipio would attempt its relief, which turned out according to
                    his expectation. Scipio, joining with the young kingof Mauritania, advanced
                    with, his army, and encamping near Cæſar, they ſoon came to a general battle.
                    Cæſar’s ſucceſs was as uſual ; the enemy received a complete and final
                    overthrow, with little loſs on his ſide. Juba, and Petreius his general, killed
                    each other in deſpair ; Scipio, attempting to eſcape by ſea into Spain, ſell in
                    among the enemy, and was ſlain ; ſo that, of all the generals of that undone
                    party, Cato was now alone remaining.</p>
                <p>This extraordinary man, havinq retired into Africa after the battle of
                    Pharſalia, had led the wretched remains of that defeat through burning deſerts
                    and tracts inſeſted with ſerpents of various malignity, and was now in the city
                    of Utica, which he had been left to deſeud. Still, however, in love with even
                    the ſhow of Roman government, he had formed the principal citizens into a
                    ſenate, and conceived a reſolution of holding out the town. He accordingly
                    aſſembled his ſenators upon this occaſion, and exhorted them to ſtand a ſiege;
                    but finding his admonitions ineffectual, lie ſtabbed himſelf with his ſword j∙.
                    Upon his death,</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0385" facs="gri_33125011196389_0391.tif"/>
                <p>the war in Africa being completed, Cæſar returned in triumph to Rome ; and, as
                    if he had abridged all his former triumphs only to increaſe the ſplendor of
                    this, the citizens were aſtoniſhed at the magnificence of the proceſſion, and
                    the number of the countries he had fub-dued. It laſted four days : the firſt was
                    for Gaul, the ſecond for Egypt, the third for his victories in Aſia, and the
                    fourth for that over Juba in Africa. To every one of his ſoldiers he gave a ſum
                    equivalent to about 1501. of our money, double that ſum to the centurions, and
                    four times as much to the ſuperior officers. The citizens alſo ſhared his bounty
                    ; to every one of whom he diſtributed 10 buſhels of corn, 10 pounds of oil, and
                    a ſum of money equal to about two pounds Sterling of ours. He, after this,
                    entertained the people at about 20,000 tables, treated them with the combat of
                    gladiators, and filled Rome with a concourir of ſpectators from every part of
                    Italy.</p>
                <p>The people now ſeemed eager only to find out new modes of homage and unuſual
                    methods of adulation for their great enſlaver. He was created, by a new title, <hi rend="italic">Magιfler Morum,</hi> or Maſter of the Morals of the
                    People ; he received the title of <hi rend="italic">Emperor, Father of his
                        country ;</hi> his perſon was declared ſacred ; and, in ſhort, up.on him
                    alone were devolved for life all the <hi rend="sup">1</hi> great dignities of
                    the ſtate. It muſt be owned, however, that no ſovereign could make a better uſe
                    of his power. He immediately began his empire by f eprefling vice and
                    encouraging virtue. He communicated the power of judicature to the ſenators and
                    the knights alone, and by many ſumptuary laws reſtrained the ſcandalous luxuries
                    of the rich. He propoſed rewards to all ſuch as had many children 5 and took the
                    moſt prudent methods of repeopling the city, that had been exhauſted in the late
                    -commotions ; and beſides his other works, he greatly reformed the kalendar. ∙</p>
                <p>Having thus reſtored proſperity once more to Rome, he again found himſelf under
                    a neceſſity of going into Spain, to oppoſe an army which had been raiſed there
                    under the two ſons of Pompey and Labienus his former general. He proceeded in
                    this expedition with his uſual celerity, and arrived in Spain before the enemy
                    thought him yet departed from Rome. Cneius and Sextus, Pompey’s ſons, profiting
                    by their unhappy father’s example, reſolved as much as poſſible to protract the
                    war ; ſo that the firſt operations of the two armies were ſpent in ſieges and
                    fruitleſs attempts to ſurpriſe each other. At length Cæſar, after taking many
                    cities from the enemy, and purſuing young Pompey with unwearied perſeverance,
                    compelled him to come to a battle upon the plains of Munda.</p>
                <p>After a moſt obſtinate engagement, Cæſar gained a complete victory (ſee Munda) ;
                    and having now ſubdued all his enemies, he returned to Rome for the laſt time to
                    receive new dignities and honours, and to enjoy an accumulation of all the great
                    offices of the ſtate. Still, however, he pretended to a moderation in the
                    enjoyment of his power ; he left the conſuls to be named by the people ; but as
                    he poſſeſſed all the authority of the office, it from this time began to fink
                    into contempt. He enlarged the number of ſenators alſo ; but as he had
                    previouſly deſtroyed their power, their new honours were but empty titles. He
                    took care to pardon all who had been in arms againſt him, but not till he had
                    deprived them of the power</p>
                <p>of reſiſtance. He even ſet up once more the ſtatues of Pompey ; which, however,
                    as Cicero obſerved, he only did to ſecure his own. The reſt of this
                    extraordinary man’s life was employed for the advantage of the ſtate. He adorned
                    the city with magnificent buildings ; he rebuilt Carthage and Corinth, ſending
                    colonies to both cities ; he undertook to level ſeveral mountains in Italy, to
                    drain the Pontine marſhes near Rome, and deſigned to cut through the Iſthmus
                    oſPeloponne-ſus. - Thus he formed mighty projects and deſigns beyond the limits
                    of the longeſt life ; but the greateſt of all was his intended expedition
                    againſt the Parthians, by which he deſigned to revenge the death of Craſſus ;
                    then to paſs through Hyrcania, and enter Scythia along the banks of the Caſpian
                    ſea ; from thence to open himſelf a way through the immeaſurable ſoreſts of
                    Germany into Gaul, and ſo return to Rome. Theſe were the aims of ambition : but
                    the jealouſy of a few individuals put an end to them all.</p>
                <p>The ſenate, with an adulation which marked the degeneracy of the times,
                    continued to load Cæſar with freſh honours, and he continued with equal vanity
                    to receive them. They called one of the months of the year after his name ; they
                    Ramped money with his image ; they ordered his ſtatue to be ſet up in all the
                    cities of the empire ; they inſtituted public ſacrifices on his birth-day ; and
                    talked, even in his life-time, of enrolling him in the number of their gods.
                    Antony, at one of their public feſtivals, fooliſhly ventured to offer him a
                    diadem ; but he put it back again, re-fuſtng it ſeveral times, and receiving at
                    every refuſal loud acclamations from the people. One day, when the ſenate
                    ordered him ſome particular honours, he neglected to riſe ſrom his ſeat ; and
                    from that moment is ſaid to have been marked for deſtruction. It began to be
                    rumoured that he intended to make himſelf king ; for though in fact he already
                    was ſo, the people, who had an utter averſton to the name, could not bear his
                    affirming the title. Whether he really deſigned to aſſume that empty honour muſt
                    now for ever remain a ſecret ; but certain it is, that the unſuſpecting openneſs
                    of his conduct marked ſomething like a conſidence in the innocence of his
                    intentions. When informed by thoſe about him of the jealouſies of many perſons
                    who envied his power, he was heard to ſay, That he had rather die once by
                    treaſon, than to live continually in the apprehenſion of it : and to convince
                    the world how little he had to apprehend from his enemies, he diſhanded his
                    company of Spaniſh guards, which facilitated the enterpriſe againſt his liſe.</p>
                <p>A deep-laid conſpiracy was formed againſt him, compoſed of no leſs than 60
                    ſenators. At the head of this conſpiracy was Brutus, whoſe life Cæſar had ſpared
                    after the battle of Pharſalia, and Caſſius, who had been pardoned ſoon after,
                    both prætors for the preſent year. Brutus made it his chief glory to have been
                    deſeended from that Brutus who firſt gave liberty to Rome ; and from a deſire of
                    following his example, broke all the ties of private friendſhip, and entered
                    into a conſpiracy which was to deſtroy his benefactor. Caſſius, on the other
                    hand, was impetuous and proud, and hated Cæſar’s perſon ſtill more than his
                    cauſe. He had often ſought an opportunity of gratifying his revenge by
                    aſſaſſination, which took riſe rather from private than public motives.</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0386" facs="gri_33125011196389_0392.tif"/>
                <p>The conſpirators, to give a colour of juſtice to their proceedings, remitted the
                    execution of this deſign to the ides of March, the day on which it was reported
                    that Cæſar was to be offered the crown. The augurs had foretold that this day
                    would be fatal to him ; and the night preceding, he heard his wife Calphurnia
                    lamenting in her ſleep, and being awakened, ihe con-feſſed to him that the
                    dreamt of his being aiΓaffιnated in her arms. Theſe omens, in ſome meaſure,
                    began to change his intentions of going to the ſenate, as he had reſolved, that
                    day ; but one of the conſpirators coming in, prevailed upon him to keep his
                    reſolution, telling him of the reproach which would attend his Haying at home
                    till his wife had lucky dreams,, and of the preparations that were made for his
                    appearance. As he went along to the ſenate, a ſlave, who haſtened to him with
                    information of the conſpiracy, attempted to come near him, but could not lor the
                    crowd. Arte-rnidorus, a Greek philoſopher, who had diſcovered the whole plot,
                    delivered to him a memorial, containing the heads of lſis information ; but
                    Cæſar gave it, with other papers, to one of his ſecretaries without reading, as
                    was uſual in things of this nature. As ſoon as he had taken his place in the
                    ſenate, the conſpirators came near him, under a pretence of ſaluting him ; and
                    Cimber, who was one of them, approached in a ſup-pliant poſture, pretending to
                    ſue for his brother’s pardon, who was baniſhed by his order. All the
                    conſpirators ſeconded him with great tenderneſs ; and Cim-ber, ſeeming to ſue
                    with ſtill greater ſubmiſſion, took hold of the bottom of his robe, holding him
                    ſo as to prevent his riſing. TTιis was the ſignal agreed on. Caſca, who was
                    behind, ſtabbed him, though flightly, in the ihoulder. Cæſar inſtantly turned
                    round, and with the ſtyle of lſis tablet wounded him in the arm. However, all
                    the conſpirators were now alarmed ; and incloſing him round, he received a
                    ſecond ſtah from an unknown hand in the breaſt, while Caffius wounded him in the
                    face. He ſtill defended himſelf with great vigour, ruihing among them, and
                    throwing down ſuch as oppoſed him, till he ſaw Brutus among the conſpira-tors,
                    who, coming up, ſtruck his dagger in his thigh. From that moment Cæſar thought
                    no more of defending himſelf, but looking upon this conſpirator, cried out, **
                    And you too, Brutus !” Then covering his head, and ſpreading his robe before him
                    in order to fall with greater decency, he ſunk down at the baſe of Pompey’s
                    ſtatue, after receiving three and twenty wounds, in the 56th year of his age,
                    and 4th of his reign.</p>
                <p>As ſoon as the conſpirators had diſpatched Cæſar, they began to addreſs
                    themſelves to the ſenate, in order to vindicate the motives of their enterpriſe,
                    and to excite them to join in procuring their country’s freedom; but all the
                    ſenators who were not accomplices fled with ſuch precipitation, that the lives
                    of ſome of them were endangered in the throng. The people alſo being now
                    alarmed, left their uſual occupations, and ran tumul-tuouily through «the city ;
                    ſome actuated by their fears, and ſtill more by a deſire of plunder. In this
                    ſtate of confuſion, the conſpirators all retired to the capitol, and guarded its
                    acceiſes by a body of gladiators which Brutus had in pay.. It was in vain <hi
                        rend="sub"> 1</hi> they alleged they only ſtruck for freedom, and that they
                    killed a tyrant who uſurped the rights of mankind : the people, accuſtom-ed te
                    luxury and eaſe, little regarded their profeſ-</p>
                <p>ſions, dreading more the dangers of poverty than e&gt;* ſubjection.</p>
                <p>The friends of the late dictator now began to find that this was the time for
                    coming into greater power than before, and for ſatisfying their ambition under
                    the veil of promoting juſtice. Of this number was Antony, whom we have already
                    ſeen acting as a lieutenant under Cæſar. He was a man of moderate abilities and
                    exceſſive vices ; ambitious of power, but ſkilled in war, to which be had been
                    trained from his youth. He was conſul for this year ; and reſolved, with
                    Lepidus, who was fond of commotions like himſelf, to ſeize this opportunity of
                    aſſuming the ſovereign power. Lepidus, therefore, took poſſeſſion of the forum
                    with a band of ſoldiers at his devotion ; and Antony, being conſul, was
                    permitted to command them. Their firſt ſtep was to poſſeſs themſelves of all
                    Cæſar’s papers and money ; and the next to convene the ſenate, in order to
                    determine whether Cæſar had been a legal magiſtrate or a tyrannical uſurper, and
                    whether thoſe who killed him merited rewards or puniſhments. There were many of
                    theſe who had received their promotions ſrom Cæſar, and had acquired large
                    fortunes in conſequence of his appointments : to vote him an
                    uſurper,'»therefore, would be to endanger their property ; and yet to vote him
                    innocent, might endanger the ſtate. In this dilemma they ſeemed willing to
                    reconcile extremes ; wherefore they approved all the acts of Cæſar, and yet
                    granted a general pardon to all the conſpirators.</p>
                <p>This decree was very far from giving Antony ſatisſaction, as it granted ſecurity
                    to a number of men who were the avowed enemies of tyranny, and who would be
                    foremoſt in oppoſing his ſchemes of reſtoring abſolute power. As therefore the
                    ſenate had ratified all Cæſar’s acts without diſtinction, he formed a ſeheme
                    upon tlſis of making him rule when dead as imperiouſ-ly as he had done when
                    living. Being, as was ſaid, poſſeſſed of Cæſar’s books of accounts, he ſo ſar
                    gained upon his ſecretary as to make him inſert whatever he thought proper. By
                    theſe means, great ſums of money, which Cæſar never would have beſtowed, were
                    here diſtributed among the people ; and every man who was averſe to republican
                    principles was here ſure of finding a gratuity. He then demanded that Cæſar’s
                    funeral obſequies ſhould be performed ; which the ſenate now could not decently
                    forbid, as they had never declared him a tyrant. Accordingly, the body was
                    brought forth into the forum with the utmoſt ſolem-nity ; and Antony began his
                    operations upon the paſſions of the people, by the prevailing motives of private
                    intereſt. He firſt read Cæſar’s will, in which he had left Octavius, his
                    fiſter’s grandſon, his heir, permitting him to take the name of <hi
                        rend="italic"> Cæſar ;</hi> and three parts of his private fortune Brutus
                    was to inherit in caſe of his death. The Roman people were left the gardens
                    which he had on the other ſide the Tiber ; and every citizen, in particular, was
                    to receive 300 ſeſter-ces. This laſt bequeſt not a little contributed to
                    increaſe the people’s affection for their late dictator ; they now began to
                    conſider Cæſar as a father, who, not ſa-tisfied with doing them the greateſt
                    good while living, thought of benefiting them even after his death. As Antony,
                    continued reading, the multitude began to be moved, and fighs and lamentations
                    were heard from every quarter. Antony, ſeeing the audience fa-</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0387" facs="gri_33125011196389_0393.tif"/>
                <p>vcurable to his deſigns, now began to addreſs the aſ-ſembly in a more pathetic
                    ſtrain : he preſented before them Cæſar's bloody robe, and, as he unfolded it,
                    took care they ſhould obſerve the number of ſtabs in it : he then diſplayed an
                    image, which to them appeared the body of Cæſar, all covered with wounds. The
                    people could now no longer contain their indignation ; they unanimouſiy cried
                    out for revenge ; all the old ſoldiers who had fought under him, burnt, with his
                    body, their coronets, and other marks of conqueſt with which he had honoured
                    them. A great number of the firſt matrons in the city threw in their ornaments
                    alſo ; till at length, rage ſucceeding to ſorrow, the multitude ran with flaming
                    brands from the pile to ſet fire to the conſpirators houſes. In this rage of
                    reſentment, meeting with one C'irma, whom they miſtook for another of the ſame
                    name who was in the conſpiracy, they tore him in pieces, The conſpirators
                    themſelves, however, being well guarded, repulſed the multitude with no great
                    trouble ; but perceiving the rage of the people, they thought it ſafeſt to
                    retire from the city. Divine honours were then granted him ; and an altar was
                    erected on the place where his body was burnt, where afterwards was erected a
                    column inſcribed, <hi rend="italic">To the father of his country.</hi></p>
                <p>In the mean time, Antony, who had excited this flame, reſolved to make the beſt
                    of the occaſion. Having gained the people by his zeal in Cæſar’s cauſe, he next
                    endeavoured to bring over the ſenate, by a ſee.ring concern for the freedom of
                    the ſtate. He therefore propoſed to recal Sextus, Pompey’s only remaining ſon,
                    who had concealed himſelf in .Spain ſince the death of his father : and to grant
                    him the command of all the fleets of the empire. His next ſtep to their
                    confidence, was the quelling a ſedition of the people, who roſe to revenge the
                    death of Cæſar, and putting their leader Amathus to death, who pretended to be
                    the ſon of Marius. He after thi3 pretended to dread the reſentment of the
                    multitude, and demanded a, guard for the ſecurity of his perſon. The ſenate
                    granted his requeſt; and, under this pretext, he drew round him a body of 6000
                    reſolute men, attached to his intereſt, and ready to execute liis commands. Thus
                    be continued every day making rapid ſtrides to abſolute power ; all the
                    authority of government was lodged in his hands and thoſe of his two brothers
                    alone, who ſhared among them the conſular, tribunitian, and pras-torian power.
                    His vows to revenge Cæſar’s death ſeemed either poſtponed, or totally forgotten
                    ; and his only aim ſeemed to be to confirm himſelf in that power which he had
                    thus artfully acquired. But an obſtacle to his ambition ſeemed to ariſe from a
                    quarter on which he leaſt expected it. This was from Octavius, or Oc-tavianus
                    Cæſar, afterwards called <hi rend="italic">Auguſtus,</hi> who was the
                    grand-nephew, and adopted ſon of Cæſar, and was at Apollonia when his kinſman
                    was ſlain. He was then about 18 years old, and had been ſent to that city to
                    improve himſelf in the ſtudy of Grecian literature·. Upon the news of Cæſar’s
                    death, notwithſtanding the earneſt diſſuaſions of all his friends, he reſolved
                    to return to Rome, to claim the inheritance, and revenge the death of his uncle.
                    From the former profeſſions of Antony, he expected to find him a warm aſſiſtant
                    to his afrits ; and he doubted not, by his concurrence, to take ſignal vengeance
                    on all who had a hand in the con</p>
                <p>ſpiracy. However, he was greatly diſappointed. Antony, whoſe projects were all
                    to aggrandize himſelf, gave him but a very cold reception, and, inſtead of
                    granting him the fortune left him by the will, delayed the payment of it upon
                    various pretences, hoping to check his ambition by limiting his circumſtances.
                    But Octavianus, inſtead of abating his claims, even ſold hie own patrimonial
                    eſtate, to pay ſuch legacies as Cæſar had left, and particularly that to the
                    people. By theſe means he gained a degree of popularity, which his enemies
                    vainly laboured to diminiſh, and which in fact he had many other methods to
                    procure. His converſation was elegant and inſinuating, his face comely and
                    graceful, and his affection to the late dictator ſo ſincere, that every perſon
                    was charmed either with his piety or his addreſs. But what added ſtill more to
                    his intereſt was the name of Cæſar, which he had aſſumed, and, in conſequencc of
                    which, the former followers of his uncle now flocked in great numbers to him.
                    All theſe he managed with ſuch art, that Antony now began to conceive a violent
                    jealouſy for the talents of his young opponent, and ſecretly laboured to
                    counteract all his deſigns. In fact, he did not want reaſon ; for the army near
                    Rome, that had long wiſhed to ſee the conſpirators puniſhed, began to turn from
                    him to his rival, whom they ſaw more ſincerely bent on gratifying their deſires.
                    Antony having procured alſo the government of Hither Gaul from the people, two
                    of his legions that he had brought home from his former government of Macedonia,
                    went over to Octavianus, notwithſtanding all his remonſtrances to detain them.
                    This produced, as uſual, interviews, complaints, recriminations, and pretended
                    reconciliations, which only tended to widen the difference ; ſo that, at length,
                    both ſides prepared for war. Ί hus the ſtate was divided into three diſtinct
                    factious ; that of Octavianus, who aimed at procuring Cæſar’s inheritance, and
                    revenging his death ; that of Antony, whoſe ſole view was to obtain abſolute
                    power ; and that of the conſpirators, who endeavoured to reſtore the ſenate to
                    its former authority.</p>
                <p>Antony being raiſed by the people to his new government of Ciſalpine Gaul,
                    contrary to the inclinations of the ſenate, reſolved to enter upon his province
                    immediately, and oppoſe Brutus, who commanded a ſmall body of troops there,
                    while his army was yet entire. He accordingly left Rome, and marching thither,
                    commanded Brutus to depart. Brutus, being unable to oppoſe him, retired with his
                    forces ; but being purſued by Antony, he was at laſt beſieged in the city of
                    Mutina, of which he ſent word to the ſenate.</p>
                <p>In the mean while, Octavianus, who by this time had raiſed a body of 10,'00 men,
                    returned to Rome; and being reſolved, before he attempted to take vengeance on
                    the conſpirators, if poſſible to diminiſh the power of Antony, began by bringing
                    over the ſenate to ſecond his deſigns. In this he ſucceeded by the credit of
                    Cicero, who had long hated Antony becauſe he thought him the enemy of the ſtate.
                    Accordingly, by means of his eloquence, a decree was paſſed, ordering Antony to
                    raiſe the ſiege of Mutina, to evacuate Ciſalpine Gaul, and to await the further
                    orders of the ſenate upon the banks of the Rubicon. Antony treated the order
                    wish contempt ; and inſtead of</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0388" facs="gri_33125011196389_0394.tif"/>
                <p>obeying, began to ſhow his diſpleaſure at being hi-' therto ſo ſubmiſſive.
                    Nothing now therefore remained for the ſenate but to declare him an enemy to the
                    ſtate, and to ſend Octavianus, with the army he had raiſed, to curb his
                    inſolence. The latter was very ready to offer his army for this expedition, in
                    order to revenge his own private injuries, before he undertook thoſe of the
                    public. The two conſuls, Hirtius and Panſa, joined all their forces ; and thus
                    combined, they marched at the head of a numerous army, againſt Antony, into</p>
                <p>Ciſalpine Gaul. After one or two ineffectual conflicts, both armies came to a
                    general engagement ; in which Antony was defeated, and compelled to fly to
                    Lepidus, who commanded a body of forces in Further Gaul. This victory', however,
                    which promiſed the ſenate ſo much ſucceſs, produced effects very different from
                    their expectations. The two conſuls were mortally wounded ; but Panſa, previous
                    to his death, called Octavianus to his bed-ſide, and adviſed him to join with
                    Antony, telling him, that the ſenate only deſired to de-preſs both, by oppoſing
                    them to each other. The advice of the dying conſul ſunk deep on his ſpirits ; ſo
                    that from that time he only ſought a pretext to break with them. Their giving
                    the command of a party of his army to Decimus Brutus, and their denying him a
                    triumph ſoon after, ſerved to alienate his mind entirely from the ſenate, and
                    made him reſolve to join Antony and Lepidus. He was willing, however, to try the
                    ſenate thoroughly, before he came to an open rupture ; wherefore he ſent to
                    demand the conſulſhip, which was refuſed him. He then thought himſelf obliged to
                    keep no meaſures with that aſſembly, but privately ſent to ſound the
                    inclinations of Antony and Lepidus, concerning a junction of forces, and found
                    them as eager to aſſiſt as the ſenate was to oppoſe him. Antony was, in fact,
                    the general of both armies, and Lepidus was only nominally ſo, his ſoldiers
                    refuſing to obey him upon the approach of the former. Wherefore, upon being
                    aſſured of the aſſiſtance of Octavianus upon their arrival in Italy, they ſoon
                    croſſed the Alps with an army of 17 legions, breathing revenge againſt all wh∂ <hi rend="sup">,</hi> had oppoſed their deſigns.</p>
                <p>The ſenate now began, too late, to perceive their error in diſobliging
                    Octavianus ; and therefore gave him the conſulſhip which they had ſo lately
                    refuſed, and, to prevent his joining with Antony, flattered him with new
                    honours, giving him a power ſuperior to all law. The firſt uſe Octavianus made
                    of his new authority was to procure a law ſor the condemnation of Brutus and
                    Caſſius ; after which, he joined his forces with thoſe of Antony and Lepidus.</p>
                <p>The meeting of theſe three uſurpers of their country’s freedom was near Mutina,
                    upon a little iſland of the river Panarus. Their mutual ſuſpicions were the
                    cauſe of their meeting in this place. Lepidus firſt entered, and, finding all
                    things ſafe, made the ſignal for the other two to approach. Octavianus began the
                    conference, by thanking Antony for his zeal in putting Decimus Brutus to death ;
                    who, being abandoned by his army, was. taken as he was deſigning to eſcape into
                    Macedonia, and beheaded by Antony’s command. Their conference laſted for three
                    days ; and the reſult of it was, that the ſupreme authority ſhould be lodged in
                    their hands, under the title of the <hi rend="italic">triumvirate,</hi> for
                    the ſpace of five years; that Antony ſhould have</p>
                <p>Gaul ; Lepidus, Spain ; and Octavianus, Africa, and the Mediterranean iſlands.
                    As for Italy, and the eaſtern provinces, they were to remain in common, until
                    their general enemy was entirely ſubdued. But the laſt article of their union
                    was a dreadful one. It was agreed that all their enemies ſhould be deſtroyed ;
                    of which each preſented a liſt. In theſe were compriſed not only the enemies,
                    but the friends of the triumvi-</p>
                <p>-rate, ſince the partiſans of the one were often found among the oppoſers of the
                    others. Thus Lepidus gave up his brother Paulus to the vengeance of his
                    colleague ; Antony permitted the proſcription of his uncle Lucius ; and
                    Octavianus delivered up the great Cicero.</p>
                <p>The moſt ſacred rights of nature were violated ; 30« ſenators, and above 2000
                    knights, were included ia this terrible proſcription ; their fortunes were
                    confiſ-cated, and their murderers enriched with the ſpoil. Rome ſoon felt the
                    effects of this infernal union, and the horrid cruelties of Marius and Sylla
                    were renewed.</p>
                <p>As many as could eſcape the cruelty of the triumvirs, fled thither into
                    Macedonia to Brutus, or found refuge with young Pompey, who was now in Sicily,
                    and co» vered the Mediterranean with his numerous navy. Their cruelties were not
                    aimed at the men alone ; but the ſofter ſex were in danger of being marked as
                    objects either of avarice or reſentment. They made out ” a liſt of 1400 women of
                    the beſt quality, and the richeſt in the city, who were ordered to give in an
                    account of their fortunes, to be taxed in proportion. But this ſeemed ſo
                    unpopular a meaſure, and was ſo firmly oppoſed by Hortenfia, who ſpoke againſt
                    it, that, inſtead of 1400 women, they were content to tax only 400. However,
                    they made up the deficiency, by extending the tax upon men ; near 100,000, as
                    well citizens as ſtrangers, were compelled to furniſh ſupplies to the ſubverſion
                    of their country’s freedom. At laſt, both the avarice and vengeance of the
                    triumviri ſeemed fully ſatisfied, and they went into the ſenate to declare that
                    the proſcription was at an end ; and thus having deluged th,e city with blood,
                    Octavianus and Antony, leaving Lepidus to defend Rome in their abſence, marched
                    with their army to oppoſe the conſpirators, who were now at the head of a
                    formidable army in Aſia.</p>
                <p>Brutus and Caſſius, the principal of theſe, upon the death of Cæſar, being
                    compelled to quit Rome, went into Greece, where they perſuaded the Roman
                    ſtudents at Athens to declare in the cauſe of freedom ; then parting, the former
                    raiſed a powerful army in Macedonia and the adjacent countries, while the latter
                    went into Syria, where he ſoon became maſter of 12 legions, and reduced his
                    opponent Dolabella to ſuch ſtraits as to kill himſelf. Both armies ſoon after
                    joining at Smyrna, the fight of ſuch a formidable force began to -revive the
                    declining ſpirits of the party, and to re-unite the two generals ſtill more

                    one ſingle ſoldier or one town that owned their command, they now found
                    themſelves at the head of a flouriſhing army, furniſhed -with all the
                    neceſſaries for carrying on the war, and in a condition to ſuppprt a conteſt
                    where the empire of the world depended on the event. This ſucceſs in raiſing
                    levies was entirely owing to the juſtice, mœ</p>

                <p>deration, and great humanity of Brutus, who in every inſtance ſeemed ſtudious of
                    the happineſs of his country.</p>
                <p>It was in this flouriſhing ſtate of their affairs that the conſpirators had
                    formed a reſolution of going againſt Cleopatra, who, on her ſide, had made great
                    preparations to aſſiſt their opponents. However, they were diverted from this
                    purpoſe by an information that Octavianus and Antony were now upon their march,
                    with 40 legions to oppoſe them. Brutus now, therefore, moved to have their army
                    paſs over into Greece and Macedonia, and there meet the enemy <hi rend="italic">γ</hi> but Caſſius ſo far prevailed as to have the Rhodians and Lycians
                    firſt reduced, who had refuſed their uſual contribution. This expe&lt;Jtion
                    was immediately put in execution, and extraordinary contributions were raiſed by
                    that means, the Rhodians having ſcarce any thing leſt but their lives *. The
                    Lycians ſuffered ſtill more ſeverely ; for having ſhut themſelves up in the city
                    of Xanthus, they defended the place againſt Brutus with ſuch fury, that neither
                    his art nor intreaties could prevail upon them to ſurrender. At length, the town
                    being ſet on fire, by their attempting to burn the works of the Romans, Brutus,
                    inſtead of laying hold on this opportunity to ſtorm the place, made every effort
                    to preſerve it, intreating his ſoldiers to try all means of extinguiſhing the
                    fire : but the deſperate phrenzy of the citizens was not to be mollified. Far
                    from thinking themſelves obliged to their generous enemy for the efforts which
                    were made to ſave them, they reſolved to periſh in the flames. Wherefore,
                    inſtead of extinguiſhing, they did all in their power to augment the fire, by
                    throwing in wood, dry reeds, and all kinds of fuel. Nothing could exceed the
                    diſtreſs of Brutus upon ſeeing the townſmea, thus reſolutely bent on deſtroying
                    themſelves : he rede about the fortifications, ſtretching out his hands to the
                    Xanthians, and conjuring them to have pity on therm· ſelves and their city ;
                    but, inſenſible to his expoſtula-tions, they ruſhed into the flames with
                    deſperate obſtinacy, and the whole ſoon became an heap of« undi-ſtinguiſhable
                    ruin. At this horrid ſpectacle, Brutus offered a reward to every ſoldier who
                    would bring him a Lycian alive. The number of thoſe whom it was poſſible to ſave
                    from their own fury amounted to no more than 150.</p>
                <p>Brutus and Caſſius met once more at Sardis, where, after the uiual ceremonies
                    were paſſed between them, they reſolved to have a private conference together,
                    when, after much altercation, they were at laſt perfectly reconciled. After
                    which, night coming on, Caſſius invited Brutus and his friends to an
                    entertainment. Upon retiring home, it was that Brutus, as Plutarch tells the
                    ſtory, ſaw a ſpectre in his tent. It was in the dead of the night, when the
                    whole camp was per* ſectly quiet, that Brutus was employed in reading by a lamp
                    that was juſt expiring. On a ſudden he thought he heard a noiſe as if ſomebody
                    entered ;. and looking towards the door, he perceived it open. A gigantic
                    figure, with a frightful aſpect, ſtood before him, and &lt; continued to
                    gaze upon him with filent ſeverity. At <hi rend="sup">,</hi> laſt Brutus had
                    courage to ſpeak to it : “ Art thou a daemon or a mortal man? and why comeſt
                    thou to me?”</p>
                <p>“ Brutus,” replied the phantom, “ I am thy evil genius, thou ſhalt ſee me again
                    at Philippi.” “ Well then,” anſwered Brutus, without being diſcompoſed,</p>
                <p>“ we ſhall meet again.” Upon which the phantom vaniſhed ; and Brutus calling to
                    his ſervants, allied if they had ſeen any thing ; to which replying in the
                    negative, he again reſumed his ſtudies. But as he was ſtruck with ſo ſtrange an
                    occurrence, he mentioned it the next day to Caſſius, who, being an Epicurean,
                    aſeribed it to the effect of imagination too much exerciſed by vigilance and
                    anxiety. Brutus appeared ſatisfied with this ſolution of his late terrors ; and,
                    as Antony and Octavianus were now advanced into Macedonia, they ſoon after
                    paſſed over into Thrace, and advanced to the city of Philippi, near which the
                    forces of the triumvirs were poſted.</p>
                <p>A battle ſoon enſued ; in which the republicans were defeated, and Caſſius
                    killed, as is related in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Philippi.</hi></p>
                <p>The firſt care of Brutus, when he became the ſole general, was to aſſemble the
                    diſperſed troops of Caſſius, and animate them with freſh hopes of victory. As
                    they had loſt all they poſſeſſed by the plundering of their camp, he promiſed
                    them 2000 denarii each man to make up their lofles. This once more inſpired them
                    with new ardour ; they admired the liberality of their general, and with loud
                    ſhouts proclaimed his former intrepidity. Still, however, he had not confidence
                    ſufficient to face the adverſary, who offered him battle the enſuing day. His
                    aim was to ſtarve his enemies, who were in extreme want of proviſions, their
                    fleet having been lately defeated. But his ſingle opinion was over-ruled by the
                    reſt of his army, who now grew every day more confident of their ſtrength, and
                    more arrogant to their new general. He was, therefore, at laft, after a reſpite
                    of 20 days, obliged to comply with their ſolicitations to try the fate of the
                    battle. Both armies being drawn out, they remained a long while oppoſite to each
                    other without offering to engage. It is ſaid that he himſelſ had loſt much of
                    his natural ardour by having again ſeen the ſpectre the night preceding :
                    however, he encouraged his men as much as poſſible, and gave the ſignal for
                    battle within three hours of fun-ſet. Fortune again declared againſt him; and
                    the two triumviri expreſsly ordered by no means to ſuffer the general to eſcape,
                    for fear he ſhould renew the war. Thus the whole body of the enemy ſeemed
                    chiefly intent on Brutus alone, and his capture ſeemed inevitable. In this
                    deplorable exigence, Lucilius his friend reſolved, by his own death, to effect
                    the general’s delivery., Upon perceiving a body of Thracian horſe cloſely
                    purſuing Brutus, and juſt upon the point of taking him, he boldly threw himſelf
                    in their way, telling them that he was. Brutus. The Thracians, overjoyed with ſo
                    great a prize, immediately diſpatched ſome of their companions, with the news of
                    their ſucceſs, to the army. Upon which, the ardour of the purſuit now abating,
                    Antony marched out to meet his priſoner ; ſome ſilently deploring the fate of ſo
                    virtuous a man ; others reproaching that mean deſire of life for which he
                    conſented to undergo captivity. Antony now feeing the Thracians approach, began
                    to prepare ~ himſelf for the interview ; but the faithful Lucilius, advancing
                    with a cheerful air, owned· the deceit that he had put upon him : on which the
                    triumvir, ſtruck with ſo much fidelity, pardoned him upon the ſpot; and from -,
                    that time forward loaded him with benefits, and hαfo∙ noured him. with his
                    friendſhip..</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0390" facs="gri_33125011196389_0396.tif"/>
                <p>In the mean time Brutus, with a ſmall number of friends, paſſed over a rivulet,
                    and, night coming on, ſat down under a rock which concealed him from the purſuit
                    of the enemy. After taking breath for a little time, he ſent out one Statilius
                    to give him ſome information of thoſe that remained; but he never returned,
                    being killed by a party of the enemy’s horſe. Brutus judging very rightly of his
                    fate, now reſolved to die likewiſe, and ſpoke to thoſe who ſtood round him to
                    lend him their laſt ſad aſſiſtance. None of them, however, would render him ſo
                    melancholy a piece of ſervice. At laſt one Strato, averting his head, preſented
                    the ſword’s point to Brutus; who threw himſelf upon it, and immediately expired.</p>
                <p>From the moment of Brutus’s death the triumviri began to act as ſovereigns, and
                    to divide the Roman dominions between them, as theirs by right of conqueſt.
                    However, though there were apparently three who thus participated all the power,
                    yet, in fact, only two were actually poſſeſſed of it; ſince Lepidus was at firſt
                    admitted merely to curb the mutual jealouſy of Antony and Octavianus, and was
                    poſſeſſed neither of intereſt in the army nor authority among the people. Their
                    firſt care was to puniſh thoſe whom they had formerly marked for vengeance. The
                    head of Brutus was ſent to Rome to be thrown at the foot of Cæſar’s ſtatue. His
                    aſhes, however, were ſent to his wife Porcia, Cato’s daughter, who afterwards
                    killed herſelf by ſwallowing burning coals. It is obſerved, that of all thoſe
                    who had a hand in the death of Cæſar, not one died a natural death.</p>
                <p>The power of the triumviri being thus eſtabliſhed upon the ruins of the
                    commonwealth, Antony went into Greece, and ſpent ſome time at Athens, converſing
                    among the philoſophers, and aſſiſting at their diſputes in perſon. From thence
                    he paſſed over into Aſia, where all the monarchs of the eaſt, who acknowledged
                    the Roman power, came to pay him their obedience. In this manner he proceeded
                    from kingdom to kingdom, attended by a crowd of ſovereigns, exacting
                    contributions, diſtributing favours, and giving away crowns with capricious
                    inſolence. He preſented the kingdom of Cappadocia to Syſenes, in prejudice of
                    Ariarathes, only becauſe he found pleaſure in the beauty of Glaphyra, the mother
                    of the former. He ſettled Herod in the kingdom of Judea, and ſupported him
                    againſt every oppoſer. But among all the ſovereigns of the eaſt who ſhared his
                    favours, none had ſo large a part as Cleo patra, the celebrated queen of Egypt.</p>
                <p>It happened that Serapion, her governor in the iſland of Cyprus, had formerly
                    furniſhed ſome ſuccours to the conſpirators; and it was thought proper that ſhe
                    ſhould anſwer for his conduct on that occaſion. Accordingly, having received
                    orders from Antony to come and clear herſelf of this imputation of infidelity,
                    ſhe readily complied, equally conſcious of the goodneſs of her cauſe and the
                    power of her beauty. She had already experienced the force of her charms upon
                    Cæſar and Pompey’s eldeſt ſon; and the addition of a few years ſince that time
                    had not impaired their luſtre. Antony was now in Tarſus, a city of Cilicia, when
                    Cleopatra reſolved to attend his court in perſon. She ſailed down the river
                    Cydnus, at the mouth of which the city ſtood, with the moſt ſumptuous pageantry.
                    Her galley was covered with gold; the ſails were of purple, large, and floating
                    in the wind. The oars of</p>
                <p>ſilver kept tune to the ſound of flutes and cymbals. She herſelf lay reclined on
                    a couch ſpangled with ſtars of gold, and with ſuch ornaments as poets and
                    painters had uſually aſcribed to Venus. On each ſide were boys like Cupids, who
                    fanned her by turns; while the moſt beautiful nymphs, dreſſed like Nereids and
                    Graces, were placed at proper diſtances around her. Upon the banks of the river
                    were kept burning the moſt exquiſite perfumes, while an infinite number of
                    people gazed upon the fight. Antony was captivated with her beauty; and, leaving
                    all his buſineſs to ſatisfy his paſſion, ſhortly after followed her into Egypt.</p>
                <p>While he thus remained idle, Octavianus, who took upon him to lead back the
                    veteran troops and ſettle them in Italy, was aſſiduouſly employed in providing
                    for their ſubliſtence. He had promiſed them lands at home, as a recompenſe for
                    their paſt ſervices; but they could not receive new grants, without turning out
                    the former inhabitants. In conſequence of this, multitudes of women, with
                    children in their arms, whoſe tender years and innocence excited univerſal
                    compaſſion, daily filled the temples and the ſtreets with their diſtreſſes.
                    Numbers of huſbandmen and ſhepherds came to deprecate the conqueror’s intention,
                    or to obtain an habitation in ſome other part of the world. Amongſt this number
                    was Virgil the poet, who in an humble manner begged permiſſion to retain his
                    patrimonial farm: Virgil obtained his requeſt; but the reſt of his countrymen,
                    of Mantua and Cremona, were turned out without mercy.</p>
                <p>Italy and Rome now felt the moſt extreme miſeries; the inſolent ſoldiers
                    plundered at will; while Sextus Pompey, being maſter of the ſea, cut off all
                    foreign communication, and prevented the people’s receiving their uſual ſupplies
                    of corn. To theſe miſchiefs were added the commencement of another civil war.
                    Fulvia, the wife of Antony, who had been left behind him at Rome, had felt ſor
                    ſome time all the rage of jealouſy, and reſolved to try every method of bringing
                    back her huſhand from the arms of Cleopatra. She conſidered a breach with
                    Octavianus as the only probable means of rouſing him from his lethargy; and
                    accordingly, with the aſſiſtance of Lucius her brother-in-law, who was then
                    conſul, and entirely devoted to her intereſt, ſhe began to ſow the ſeeds of
                    diſſenſion. The pretext was, that Antony ſhould have a ſhare in the diſtribution
                    of lands as well as Octavianus. This produced ſome negociations between them;
                    Octavianus offered to make the veterans themſelves umpires in the diſpute.
                    Lucius refuſed to acquieſce; and being at the head of more than ſix legions,
                    moſtly compoſed of ſuch as had been diſ-poſſeſſed of their lands, he reſolved to
                    compel Octavianus to accept of whatever terms he ſhould offer. Thus a new war
                    was excited between Octavianus and Antony; or, at leaſt, the generals of the
                    latter aſſumed the function of his name. Octavianus, however, proved victorious:
                    Lucius was hemmed in between two armies, and conſtrained to retreat to Reruſia,
                    a city of Etruria, where he was cloſely beſieged by the oppoſite party. He made
                    many deſperate ſallies, and Fulvia did all in her power to relieve him, but
                    without ſucceſs. He was at laſt, therefore, reduced to ſuch extremity by famine,
                    that he came out in perſon and delivered himſelf up to the mercy of the
                    conqueror. Octavianus received him very honourably, and generouſly pardoned him
                    and all his followers. Thus having con-</p>

                <p>cluded the war in a few months, he returned in triumph to Rome.</p>
                <p>Antony, who, during this interval, was revelling in all the ſtudied luxuries
                    procured him by his inſidious miſtreſs, having heard of his brother’s overthrow,
                    and his wife’s being compelled to leave Italy, was reſolved to oppoſe Octavianus
                    without delay. He accordingly ſailed at the head of a conſiderable fleet from
                    Alexandria to Tyre, from thence to Cyprus and Rhodes, and had an interview with
                    Fulvia his wife at Athens. He much blamed her for occaſioning the late
                    diſorders, teſtified the utmoſt contempt for her perſon, and, leaving her upon
                    her death-bed at Sycion, haſtened into Italy to fight Octavianus. They both met
                    at Brunduſium; and it was now thought that the flames of a civil war were going
                    to blaze out once more. The forces of Antony were numerous, but moſtly newly
                    raiſed; however, he was aſſiſted by Sextus Pompeius, who in theſe oppoſitions of
                    intereſts was daily coming into power. Octavianus was at the head of thoſe
                    veterans who had always been irreſiſtible, but who ſeemed no way diſpoſed to
                    fight againſt Antony their former general. A negociation was therefore propoſed;
                    and a reconciliation was effected. All offences and affronts were mutually
                    forgiven; and to cement the union, a marriage was concluded between Antony and</p>
                <p>Octavia, the ſiſter of Octavianus. A new diviſion of the Roman empire was made
                    between them; Octavianus was to have the command of the weſt, Antony of the
                    eaſt, while Lepidus was obliged to content himſelf with the provinces in Africa.
                    As for Sextus Pompeius, he was permitted to retain all the iſlands he had
                    already poſſeſſed, together with Peloponneſus: he was alſo granted the privilege
                    of demanding the conſulſhip in his abſence, and of diſcharging that office by
                    any of his friends. It was likewiſe ſtipulated to leave the ſea open, and pay
                    the people what corn was due out of Sicily. Thus a general peace was concluded,
                    to the great ſatisfaction of the people, who now expected a ceſſation from all
                    their calamities.</p>
                <p>This calm ſeemed to continue for ſome time: Antony led his forces againſt the
                    Parthians, over whom his lieutenant, Ventidius, had gained great advantages.
                    Octavianus drew the greateſt part of his army into Gaul, where there were ſome
                    diſturbances; and Pom-pcy went to ſecure his newly ceded province to his
                    intereſt. It was on this quarter that freſh motives were given for renewing the
                    war. Antony, who was obliged by treaty to quit Peloponneſus, refuſed to evacuate
                    it till Pompey had ſatisfied him for ſuch debts as were due to him from the
                    inhabitants. This Pompey would by no means comply with; but immediately fitted
                    out a new fleet, and renewed his former enterpriſes, by cutting off ſuch corn
                    and proviſions as were conſigned to Italy. Thus the grievances of the poor were
                    again renewed; and the people began to complain, that inſtead of three tyrants
                    they were now oppreſſed by four.</p>
                <p>In this exigence, Octavianus, who had long meditated the beſt means of
                    diminiſhing the number, reſolved to begin by getting rid of Pompey, who kept the
                    ſtate in continual alarms. He was maſter of two fleets; one of which he had
                    cauſed to be built at Ravenna; and another which Menodorus, who revolted from
                    Pompey, brought to his aid. His firſt attempt was to invadeSicily; but being
                    overpowered in his paſſage by</p>
                <p>Pompey, and afterwards ſhattered in a ſtorm, he was obliged to defer his deſigns
                    to the enſuing year. During this interval he was reinforced by a fleet of 120
                    ſhips, given him by Antony, with which he reſolved once more to invade Sicily on
                    three ſeveral quarters. But fortune ſeemed ſtill determined to oppoſe him. He
                    was a ſecond time diſabled and ſhattered by a ſtorm: which ſo raiſed the vanity
                    of Pompey, that he began to ſtyle himſelf the <hi rend="italic">ſon of Neptune.</hi> However, Octavianus was not to be intimidated by any diſgraces; for having
                    ſhortly refitted his navy, and recruited his forces, he gave the command ef both
                    to Agrippa, his faithful friend and aſſociate in war. Agrippa proved himſelf
                    worthy of the truſt repoſed in him: he began his operations by a victory over
                    Pompey; and, though he was ſhortly after worſted himſelf, he ſoon after gave his
                    adverſary a complete and final overthrow. Thus undone, Pompey reſolved to fly to
                    Antony, ſrom whom he expected refuge, as he had formerly obliged that triumvir
                    by giving protection to his mother. However, he tried once more, at the head of
                    a ſmall body of men, to make himſelf independent, and even ſurpriſed Antony’s
                    officers who had been ſent to accept of his ſubmiſſions. Nevertheleſs, he was at
                    laſt abandoned by his ſoldiers, and delivered up to Titus, Antony’s lieutenant,
                    who ſhortly after cauſed him to be ſlain.</p>
                <p>The death of this general removed one very powerful obſtacle to the ambition of
                    Octavianus, and he reſolved to take the earlieſt opportunity to get rid of the
                    reſt of his aſſociates. An offence was ſoon furniſhed by Lepidus, that ſerved as
                    a ſufficient pretext for depriving him of his ſhare in the triumvirate. Being
                    now at the head of 22 legions, with a ſtrong body of cavalry, he idly ſuppoſed
                    that his preſent power was more than an equivalent to the popularity of
                    Octavianus. He therefore reſolved upon adding Sicily, where he then was, to his
                    province; pretending a right, as having firſt invaded it. His colleague ſent to
                    expoſtulate upon theſe proceedings; but Lepidus fiercely replied, ‘ that he was
                    determined to have his ſhare in the adminiſtration, and would no longer ſubmit
                    to let one alone poſ-ſeſs all the authority. ’ Octavianus was previouſly
                    informed of the diſpoſition of Lepidus’s ſoldiers; for he had, by his ſecret
                    intrigues and largeſſes, entirely attached them to himſelf. Wherefore, without
                    further delay, he with great boldneſs went alone to the camp ef Lepidus, and
                    with no other aſſiſtance than his private bounties, and the authority he had
                    gained by his former victories, he reſolved to depoſe his rival. The ſoldiers
                    thronged round him with the moſt dutiful alacrity, while Lepidus haſtened to
                    prevent their defection. But Octavianus, though he received a wound from one of
                    the centurions, went with great preſence of mind to the place where the military
                    enſigns were planted, and, flouriſhing one of them in the air, all the legionary
                    ſoldiers ran in crowds and ſaluted him as their general. Lepidus being thus
                    abandoned by his men, diveſted himſelf of all the marks of his authority, which
                    he could no longer keep, and ſuhmiſſively threw himſelf at the feet of
                    Octavianus. This general ſpared his life, notwithſtanding the remonſtrances of
                    his army; but deprived him of all his former authority, and baniſhed him to
                    Circæum.</p>
                <p>Octavianus was received upon his return to Rome with univerſal joy; the ſenators
                    met him at the gates,</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0392" facs="gri_33125011196389_0398.tif"/>
                <p>and conducted him to the capitol; the people followed, crowned with garlands of
                    flowers; and after having returned thanks to the gods, waited upon him to his
                    palace. There remained now but one obſtacle to his ambition, which was Antony,
                    whom lie reſolved to remove, and for that purpoſe began to render his character
                    as contemptible as he poſſibly could at Rome. In fact, Antony’s conduct did not
                    a little contribute to promote the endeavours of his ambitions partner in the
                    ſtate. He had marched againſt the Parthians with a prodigious army; but was
                    forced to return with the loſs of the fourth part of his forces, and all his
                        baggage<note anchored="true" place="margin" type="suthorial">See <hi
                            rend="italic">Parthia.</hi></note>. This extremely diminiſhed his
                    reputation; but his making a triumphal entry into Alexandria ſoon after,
                    entirely diſguſted the citizens of Rome. However, Antony ſeemed quite regardleſs
                    of their reſentment: totally diſregarding the buſineſs of the ſtate, he ſpent
                    whole days and nights in the company of Cleopatra, who ſtudied every art to
                    increaſe his paſſion, and vary his entertainments. Not contented with ſharing in
                    her company all the delights which Egypt could afford, Antony was reſolved to
                    enlarge his ſphere of luxury, by granting her many of thoſe kingdoms which
                    belonged to the Roman empire. He gave her all Phoenicia, Celo-Syria, and Cyprus;
                    with a great part of Cilicia, Arabia, and Judea; gifts which he had no</p>
                <p>-right to beſtow, but which he pretended to grant in imitation of Hercules. This
                    complication of vice and ſolly at length totally exaſperated the Romans ; and
                    Octavianus, willing to take advantage of their reſentment, took care to
                    exaggerate aſt his defects. At 'length, when he found the people fuſſiciently
                    irritated againſt him, he reſolved to ſend Octavia, who was then at Rome, to
                    Antony, as if with a view of reclaiming Tier huſhand; but, in fact, to furniſh a
                    ſufficient pretext of declaring war againſt him, a8 he knew ſhe would be
                    diſmiſſed with contempt.</p>
                <p>Antony was now in the city of Leucopolis, revelling with his inſidious paramour,
                    when he heard that Octavia was at Athens, upon her journey to viſit him. This
                    •was very unwelcome news to him as well as to Cleopatra ; who, fearing the
                    charms of her rival, endeavoured , to convince Antony of the ſtrength of her
                    paſſion. He frequently caught her in tears, which ſhe ſeemed as if willing to
                    hide; and often intreated her to tell him the cauſe, which ſhe ſeemed willing to
                    ſuppreſs. Theſe artifices, together with the ceaſeleſs flattery and importunity
                    of her creatures, prevailed ſo much upon Antony’s weakneſs, that he commanded
                    Octavia to return home without ſeeing her, and attached himſelf ſtill more
                    cloſely to Cleopatra than before. His ridiculous paſſion now began to have no
                    bounds. He reſolved to own her ſor his wiſe, and entirely to repudiate Octavia.
                    He accordingly aſſembled the people of Alexandria in the public theatre, where
                    was raiſed an alcove of ſilver, under which were placed two thrones of gold, one
                    for himſelſ and the other for Cleopatra. There he ſeated himſelf, dreſſed like
                    Bacchus, while .Cleopatra ſat beſide him clothed in the ornaments and attributes
                    of lſis, the principal deity of the Egyptians. On that occaſion he declared her
                    queen of all the countries which hc had already beſtowed uponher; while he
                    aſſociated Gæfa-rio, her ſon by Cæſar, as her partner in the government. To the
                    two children which he had by her himſelf he gave the title of <hi rend="italic">king of kings,</hi> with very extenſive do</p>
                <p>minions ; and, to crown his abſurdities, he ſent a ml· nute account of his
                    proceedings to the two conſuls at Rome. It was now neceſſary to act up to his
                    imaginary dignity ; new Luxuries and pageantries were now therefore ſtudied, and
                    new marks of profuſion found out : not leſs than 6o&gt;oool.∙of our money
                    were laviſhed upon one ſingle entertainment; it is ſaid, upon this occaſion,
                    that Cleopatra diſſolved a pearl of great value in •vinegar, and drank it off.
                    But wo are told of one circumſtance that might well repreſs their delights, and
                    teach mankind to reliſh the beverage of virtue, however ſimple, above their
                    greateſt luxuries. He was ſuſpicious of being poiſoned in every meal ; he feared
                    Gleopatra, whom he ſo much loved, and would eat nothing without having it
                    previouſly taſted by one of his attendants.</p>
                <p>In the mean time Octavianus had now a ſufficient pretext for declaring war; and
                    informed the ſenate of his intentions. However, he deferred the execution of his
                    deſign for a while, being then employed in quelling an inſurrection of the
                    Illyrians. The following year was chiefly taken up in preparations againſt
                    Antony, who, perceiving his deſign, remonſtrated to the ſenate, that he had many
                    cauſes of complaint againſt his colleague, who had ſeized upon Sicily without
                    offering him a ſhare ; alleging that he had alſo diſpoſſeſſed Lepidus, and kept
                    to himſelf the province he had commanded ; and that he had divided all Italy
                    among his own ſoldiers, leaving nothing to recompenſe thoſe in Aſia. To this
                    complaint Octavianus was contented to make a ſar-caſtic anſwer ; implying, that
                    it was abſurd to complain of his diſtribution of a few trifling diſtricts in
                    Italy, when Antony having conquered Parthia, he might now reward his ſoldiers
                    with cities and provinces. The ſar-caſm upon Antony’s misfortunes in Parthia ſo
                    provoked him, that he ordered Canidius, who commanded his army, to march without
                    intermiſſion into Europe ; while he and Cleopatra followed to Samos, in order to
                    prepare for carrying on the war with vigour. When arrived there, it was
                    ridiculous enough to behold the odd mixture of preparations for pleaſure and for
                    war. Gn one ſide all the kings and princes from Europe to the Euxine ſea had
                    orders to ſend him thither ſupplies both of men, proviſions, and arms ; on the
                    other lide, all the comedians, dancers, buffoons, and muſicians of Greece, were
                    ordered to attend him. Thus, frequently, when a ſhip was thought to arrive laden
                    with ſoldiers, arms, and ammunition, it was found only filled with players and
                    theatrical machinery. When news was expected of the approach of an army,
                    meſſengers only arrived with tidings of a freſh quantity of veniſon. The kings
                    who attended him endeavoured to gain hie favour more by their entertainments
                    than their warlike preparations ; the provinces ſtrove rather to pleaſe him by
                    ſacriſicing to his divinity, than by their alacrity in his defence ; ſo that
                    ſome were heard to ſay, “ What rejoicings would not this man make for a victory,
                    when he thus triumphs at the eve of a dangerous war!” In ſhort, his beſt friends
                    now began to forſake his intereſts.</p>
                <p>His delay at Samos, and afterwards at Athens, where he carried Cleopatra to
                    receive new honours, was extremely favourable to the arms of Octavianus. This
                    general was at firſt ſcarcely in a diſpoſition to oppoſe him, had he gone into
                    Italy ; but hc ſoon found time</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0393" facs="gri_33125011196389_0399.tif"/>
                <p>to put himſelf in a condition for carrying on the war, and ſhortly after
                    declared it againſt hi n in form. All Antony’s followers were invited over to
                    join him, with great promiſes of rewards : but they were not declared enemies,
                    partly to prevent their growing deſperate, and partly to give a ſhow of
                    moderation to his own party. At length both found themſelves in readineſs to
                    begin the war, and their armies were anſwerable to the empire they contended
                    for. The one was followed by all the forces of the eaſt ; the other drew all the
                    ſtrength of the weſt to ſupport his pretenſions. Antony’s force compoſed a body
                    of ιoo,coo foot and 12,000 horſe ; while his fleet amounted to 500 ſhips of war.
                    The army of Octavianus muſtered but 80,000 foot, but equalled his adverſary’s in
                    his number of cavalry : his fleet was but half as numerous as Antony’s ;
                    however, his ſhips were better built, and manned with better ſoldiers.</p>
                <p>The great deciſive engagement, which was a naval one, was fought near Actium, a
                    city of Epirus, at the entrance of the gulph of Ambracia. Antony ranged his
                    ſhips before the mouth of the gulph ; and Octavianus drew up his fleet in
                    oppoſition. Neither general aſſumed any fixed ſtation to command in ; but went
                    about from ſhip to ſhip wherever his preſence was neceſſary. In the mean time,
                    the two land armies, on oppoſite ſides of the gulph, were drawn up, only as
                    ſpectators of the engagement ; and encouraged the fleets by their ſhouts to
                    engage. The battle began on both ſides with great ardour, and after a manner not
                    practiſed upon former occaſions. The prows of their veſſels were armed with
                    brazen points ; and with theſe they drove furiouſly againſt each other. In this
                    conflict the ſhips of Antony came with greater force, but thoſe of Octavianus
                    avoided the ſhock with greater dexterity. On Antony’s ſide, the Items of the
                    ſhips were raiſed in form of a tower; ſrom whence they threw arrows from
                    machines for that purpoſe. Thoſe of Octavianus made uſe of long poles hooked
                    with iron, and fire-pots. They fought in this manner for ſome time with equal
                    animoſity ; nor was there any advantage on either ſide, except a ſmall
                    appearance of diſorder in the centre of Antony’s fleet. But all of a ſudden
                    Cleopatra determined the fortune of the day. She was ſeen flying from the
                    engagement attended by 60 ſail; ſtruck, perhaps, with the terrors natural to her
                    ſex : but what increaſed the general amazement was, to behold Antony himſelf
                    following ſoon after, and leaving his fleet at the mercy of the conquerers. The
                    engagement, notwithſtanding, continued with great obſtinacy till five in the
                    evening ; when Antony 's forces, partly conſtrained by the conduct of Agrippa,
                    and partly perſuaded 'by the promiſes of Octavianus, ſubmitted to the-conqueror.
                    The land-forces ſoon after followed the example of the navy ; and all yielded to
                    the conqueι or without ſtriking a blow the fourth day after the battle.</p>
                <p>λVhen Cleopatra fled, Antony purſued her in a five-oared galley ; and coming
                    alongside of her ſhip entered, without ſeeing ör being ſeen by -her. She was in
                    the ſtern, and he went to the prow, where he remained for ſome time ſilent,
                    holding his head between his hands. In this manner he continued three whole days
                    ; during which, either through indignation or ſhame, he neither ſaw nor ſpoke to
                    Cleopatra. At laſt, when they were arrived at the promqntory of Tenants, the
                    queen’s female attendants reconciled them, and everything went on as before.
                    Still, however, he had the conſolation to ſuppoſe his army continued faithful to
                    him ; and accordingly diſpatched orders to his lieutenant Canidius to conduct <hi rend="italic">it</hi> into Aſia. However, he was ſoon undeceived when
                    he arrived in Africa, where he was informed of their ſubmiſſion to his rival.
                    This account ſo tranſported him with rage, that he was hardly prevented from
                    killing himſelf; but at length, at the entreaty of his friends, he returned to
                    Alexandria, in a very different ſituation from that in which Ke had left it ſome
                    time before. Cleopatra, however, ſeemed to retain that fortitude in her
                    misfortunes which had utterly abandoned her admirer. Having amaſſed conſiderable
                    riches by means of confiſcation and other acts of violence, ſhe formed a very
                    Angular and unheard of project ; this was to convey her whole fleet over the
                    iſthmus of Suez into the Red Sea, and thereby ſave herſelf in another region
                    beyond the reach of Rome, with all her treaſures. Some of her veſſels were
                    actually tranſported thither, purſuant to her orders ; but the Arabians having
                    burnt them, and Antony diſſuading her from the deſign, ſhe abandoned it for the
                    more improbable ſeheme of defending Egypt againſt the conqueror.— She omitted
                    nothing in her power to put his advice in practice, and made all kinds of
                    preparations for war ; at leaſt hoping thereby to obtain better terms from
                    Octavianus. In fact, ſhe had always loved Antony’s fortunes rather than his
                    perſon ; and if ſhe could have fallen upon any method of ſaving herſelf, though
                    even at his expence, there is no doubt but ſhe would have embraced it with
                    gladneſs. She even ſtill had ſome hopes from the power of her charms, though ſhe
                    was arrived almoſt at the age of 40 ; and was deſirous of trying upon Octavianus
                    thoſe arts which had been ſo ſucceſsful with the greateſt men of Rome. Thus, in
                    three embaſſies which were ſent one after another from Antony to his rival in
                    Aſia, the queen had always her ſecret agents, charged with particular propoſals
                    in her name. Antony deſired no more than that his liſe might be ſpared, and to
                    have the liberty of paſſing the remainder of his days in ob-ſcurity. To theſe
                    propoſals Octavianus made no reply. Cleopatra ſent him alſo public propoſals in
                    favour of her children ; but at the ſame time privately reſigned him her crown,
                    with all the enſigns of royalty. To the queen’s public propoſal no anſwer was
                    given j to her private offer he replied, by giving her aſſurances of his ſavour
                    in caſe, ſhe ſent away Antony or put him to death. Theſe negociations were not
                    ſo private but they came to the knowledge of Antony, whoſe jealouſy and rage was
                    now heightened by every concurrence. He built a ſmall folitary houſe upon a mole
                    in the ſea ; and there he paſſed his time, ſhunning all commerce with mankind,
                    and profeſſing to imitate Timon the rran-hater. However, his furious jealouſy
                    drove him even from this retreat into ſociety; for hearing that Cleopatra had
                    many ſecret conferences with one Thyrſus, an emiſſary from Octavianus, he ſeized
                    upon him, and having ordered him to be cruelly ſcourged, he ſent him back to his
                    patron. At the ſame time he ſent letters by him, importing, that he had
                    chaſtiſed Thyrſus for inſulting a man in his misfortunes ; but withal he gave
                    his rival permiſſion to avenge himſelf, by ſcourging Hiparchus, Antony’s
                    freedman, in the fame manner. The revenge, in this caſe, would have</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0394" facs="gri_33125011196389_0400.tif"/>
                <p>been highly pleaſing to Antony, as Hiparchus had left him to join the fortunes
                    of his more ſucceſsful rival.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the operations of the war were carried vigorouſly forward, and Egypt
                    was once more the theatre of the contending armies of Rome. Gallus, the
                    lieutenant of Oéfavianus, took Paretonium, which opened the whole country to his
                    incurſions. On the other ſide, Antony, who had ſtill conſiderable forces by ſea
                    and land, wanted to take that important place from the enemy. He therefore
                    marched towards it, flattering himſelf, that as ſoon as he ſhould ſhow himſelf
                    to the legions which he had once commanded, their affection for their ancient
                    general would revive. He approached, therefore, and exhorted them to remember
                    their former vows of fidelity. Gallus, however, ordered all the trumpets to
                    ſound, in order to hinder Antony from being heard, ſo that he was obliged to
                    retire.</p>
                <p>Octavianus himſelf was in the mean time advancing with another army before
                    Peluſium, which, by its ſtrong ſituation, might have retarded his progreſs for
                    ſo ne time. But the governor of the city, either wanting courage to defend it,
                    or previouſly inſtructed by Cleopatra to give it up, permitted him to take
                    poſſeſſion of the place ; ſo that Octavianus had now no obſtacle in his way to
                    Alexandria, whither he marched with all expedition. Antony, upon his arrival,
                    ſallied out to oppoſe him, fighting with great deſperation, and putting the
                    enemy’s cavalry to flight. This flight advantage once more revived his declining
                    hopes ; and, being naturally vain, he re-entered Alexandria in triumph. Then
                    going, all armed as he was, to the palace, he embraced Cleopatra, and preſented
                    her a ſoldier who had diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the late engagement. The queen
                    rewarded him very magnificently ; preſenting him with an head-piece and
                    breaft~plate of gold. With theſe, however, the ſoldier went off the next night
                    to the other army. /Antony could not bear this defection without freſh
                    indignation ; he reſolved, therefore, to make a bold expiring effort by ſea and
                    land, but previouſly offered to ſight his adverſary in ſingle combat. Octavianus
                    too well knew the inequality of their ſituations to comply with this forlorn
                    offer ; he only <hi rend="sub">r</hi> therefore, coolly replied, that Antony
                    had ways enough to die beſides ſingle combat.</p>
                <p>The evening before the day appointed for the laſt deſperate attempt, he ordered
                    a grand entertainment to be prepared. At day-break he poſted the few troops he
                    had remaining upon a riſing ground near the city : from whence he ſent orders to
                    his galleys to engage the enemy. There he waited to be a ſpectator of the combat
                    ; and, at firſt, he had the ſatisfaction to ſee them advance in good order ; but
                    his approbation was ſoon turned into rage, when he ſaw his ſhips only ſaluting
                    thoſe of Octavianus, and both fleets uniting together, and foiling back into the
                    harbour. At the very ſame time his cavalry deſerted him. He tried, however, to
                    lead on his infantry ; which were eaſily vanquiſhed, and he himſelf compelled to
                    return into the town. His anger was now ungovernable ; he could not help crying
                    out aloud as he paſſed, that he was betrayed by Cleopatra, and delivered by her
                    to thoſe who, for her ſake alone, were his enemies. In theſe ſuſpicions he was
                    not deceived ; for it was by ſecret orders from the queen that the fleet had
                    paſſed over to the enemy.</p>
                <p>Cleopatra had, ſor a long while, dreaded the effects of Antony’s jealouſy ; and
                    had, ſome time before, prepared a method of obviating any ſudden follies it
                    might produce. Near the temple of lſis ſhe had erected a building, which was
                    ſeemingly deſigned for a ſepulchre. Hither ſhe removed all her treaſure and moſt
                    valuable effects, covering them over with torches, faggots, and other
                    combuſtible matter. This ſepulchre ſhe deſigned to anſwer a double purpoſe ; as
                    well to ſcreen her from the ſudden reſentments of Antony, as to make Octavianus
                    believe that ſhe would burn all her treaſures in caſe he refuſed her proper
                    terms of capitulation. Here, therefore, ſhe retired from Antony’s preſent fury ;
                    (hutting the gates, which were fortified with bolts and bars of iron : but in
                    the mean time gave orders that a report ſhould be ſpread of her death.— This
                    news, which ſoon reached Antony, recalled all his former love and tenderneſs. He
                    now lamented her death with the ſame violence he had but a few minutes before
                    ſeemed to deſire it ; and called one of his freed-men, named <hi rend="italic">Eros,</hi> whom he had engaged by oath to kill him whenever fortune ſhould
                    drive him to this laſt reſource. Eros being now commanded to perform his
                    promiſe, this faithful follower drew the ſword, as if going to execute hie
                    orders ; but turning his face, plunged it into his own boſom, and died at his
                    maſter’s feet. Antony for a while hung over his faithful ſer-vant, and,
                    commending his fidelity, took up the ſword, with which ſtabbing himſelf in the
                    belly, he fell backward upon a little couch. Though the wound was mortal, yet
                    the blood ſtopping he recovered his ſpirits, and earneſtly conjured thoſe who
                    were come into the room to put an end to his life ; but they all fled, being
                    ſeized with fright and horror. He therefore continued in agonies for ſome time ;
                    till he was informed by one of the queen’s ſecretaries that his miſtreſs was
                    ſtill alive. He then earneſtly deſired to be carried to the place where ſhe was.
                    They accordingly brought him to the gate of the ſepulchre ; but Cleopatra, who
                    would not permit it to be opened, appeared at the window, and threw down cords
                    in order to pull him up. In this manner, aſſiſted by her two female attendants,
                    ſhe raiſed him all bloody from the ground ; and while yet fuſpended in the air,
                    he continued ſtretching out his-hands to encourage her. Cleopotra and her maids
                    had only juſt ſtrength ſufficient to raiſe him ; and at laſt, with much
                    ſtraining, they effected their purpoſe, and carried him to a couch, on which
                    they gently laid him. Here ſhe gave way to her ſorrow, tearing her clothes,
                    beating her breaſt, and kiſſing the wound of which he was dying. She called upon
                    him as her lord, her huſhand, her emperor, and ſeemed to have forgot her own
                    diſtreſſes in the greatneſs of his ſufferings, Antony entreated her to moderate
                    the tranſports of her grief, and allied for ſome wine. After he had drank, he
                    entreated Cleopatra to endeavour to preſerve her life, if ſhe could do it with
                    honour ; and recommended Proculus, a friend of Octavianus, as one ſhe might rely
                    on to be her interceſſor. Juſt as he had done ſpeaking, he expired ; and
                    Proculus made his appearance by command of Octavianus, who had been informed of
                    Antony’s deſperate conduct. He was ſent to try all means of getting Cleopatra
                    into his power ; his maſter having a double motive for his ſolicitude on this
                    occaſion ; one, to prevent her deſtroying the treaſures ſhe had taken with her
                    into the tomb j the other,</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0395" facs="gri_33125011196389_0401.tif"/>
                <p>to preſerve her perſon as an ornament to grace his tri* umph. Cleopatra,
                    however, was upon her guard, and wouid not confer with Proculus, except through
                    the gate, which was well ſecured. In the mean time, while he deſignedly drew out
                    the conference to ſome length, and had given Gallus,one of his fellow-ſoldiers,
                    directions to carry on the converſation in his abſence, he entered with two more
                    by the window at which Antony had been drawn up. As ſoon as he was entered, he
                    ran down to the gate ; and one of the women crying out, that they were taken
                    alive, Cleopatra, perceiving what had happened, drew a poniard, and attempted to
                    ftab herſelf ; but Proculus prevented the blow, and gently remonſtrated that ſhe
                    was cruel in refuſing ſo good a prince as his maſter was the pleaſure of
                    diſplaying his clemency. He then forced the poniard out of her hand, and
                    examined her clothes to be certain ſhe had no poiſon about her. Thus leaving
                    every thing ſecured, he went to acquaint his maſter with his proceedings.</p>
                <p>Octavianus was extremely pleaſed at finding her in his power : he ſent
                    Epaphroditus to bring her to his palace, and to watch her with the utmoſt
                    circumſpec-tion. He was likewiſe ordered to uſe her, in every reſpect, with that
                    deference and ſubmiſſion which were due to her rank, and to do every thing in
                    his power to render her captivity agreeable. She was permitted to have the
                    honour of granting Antony the rites of burial, and furniſhed with every thing
                    ſhe deſired, that was becoming his dignity to receive, or her love to offer. Yet
                    ſtill ſhe languiſhed under her new confinement. Her exceſſive ſorrow, her many
                    loſſes, and the blows ſhe had given her boſom, produced a fever which ſhe ſeemed
                    willing to increaſe. She reſolved to abſtain from taking any nouriſhment, under
                    the pretence of a regimen neceſſary for her diſorder ; but Octavianus being made
                    acquainted with the real motive by her phyſician, began to threaten her with
                    regard to her children, in caſe ſhe perſiſted. This was the only puniſhment that
                    could now affect her ; ſhe allowed herſelf to be treated as they thought proper,
                    and received whatever was preſcribed for her recovery.</p>
                <p>In the mean time Octavianus made his entry into Alexandria ; taking care to
                    mitigate the fears of the inhabitants, by converſing familiarly as he went along
                    with Areus, a philoſopher, and a native of the place. The citizens, however,
                    trembled at his approach ; and when he placed himſelf upon the tribunal, they
                    pro-ſtrated themſelves, with they· faces to the ground, before him, like
                    criminals who waited the ſentence of their execution. Octavianus preſently
                    ordered them to riſe; telling them, that three motives induced him to pardon
                    them : His reſpect for Alexander, who was the founder of their city ; his
                    admiration of its beauty ; and his friendſhip for Areus, their fellow-citizen.
                    Two only of particular note were put to death upon this occaſion ; Antony’s
                    eldeſt ſon Antyllus, and Cæſario, the ſon of Julius Cæſar ; both betrayed into
                    his hands by their respective tutors, who themſelves ſuffered for their perfidy
                    ſhortly after. As for the reſt of Cleopatra’s children, he treated them with
                    great gentleneſs, leaving them to the care of thoſe who were entruſted with
                    their education, who had orders to provide them with every thing ſuitable to
                    their birth. When ſhe was recovered from her late indiſpoſition, he came to
                    viſit her in perſon.— Cleopatra had been preparing for this interview, and</p>
                <p>made uſe of every method ſhe could think, of to propi-' tiate the conqueror, and
                    to gain his affection ; but in vain. However, at his departure, Octavianus
                    imagined that he had reconciled her to life, and to the indignity of being ſhown
                    in the intended triumph, which he was preparing for on his return to Rome: but
                    in this he was deceived, Cleopatra, all this time, had kept a correſpondence
                    with Dolabella, a young Roman of high birth, in the camp of Octavianus ; who,
                    perhaps, from compaſſion, or ſtronger motives, was intereſted in the misfortunes
                    of that princeſs. From him ſhe learnt the intentions of Octavianus, and that he
                    was determined to ſend her off in three days, together with her children, to
                    Rome. She now therefore determined upon dying; but previouſly intreated
                    permiſſion to pay her oblations at Antony’s tomb. This requeſt being granted
                    her, ſhe was carried with her two female attendants to the ſtately monument
                    where he was laid. There ſhe threw herſelf upon his coffin, bewailed her
                    captivity, and renewed her proteſtations not to ſurvive him. She then crowned
                    the tomb with garlands of flowers ; and having kiſſed the coffin a thouſand
                    times, ſhe returned home to execute her fatal reſolution. Having bathed, and
                    ordered a ſumptuous banquet, ſhe attired herſelf in the moſt ſplendid manner.
                    She then feaſted as uſual ; and ſoon after ordered all but her two attendants,
                    Charmi-on and Iras, to leave the room. Then, having previouſly ordered an aſp to
                    be ſecretly conveyed to her in a bafl&lt;et of fruit, ſhe ſent a letter to
                    Octavianus, informing him of her fatal purpoſe, and deſiring to be buried in the
                    ſame tomb with Antony. Octavianus, upon receiving this letter, inſtantly
                    diſpatched meſſengers to prevent her, but they arrived too late. Upon entering
                    the chamber, they beheld Cleopatra lying dead upon a gilded couch, arrayed in
                    her royal robes. Near her,</p>
                <p>Iras, one of her faithful attendants, was ſtretched liſeleſs at the ſeet of her
                    miſtreſs : and Charmion herſelf, almoſt expiring, was ſettling the diadem upon
                    Cleopatra’s head. She died at the age of thirty-nine, after having-reigned
                    twenty-two years. Her death put an end to the monarchy in Egypt, which had
                    flouriſhed there from time immemorial.</p>
                <p>Octavianus ſeemed much troubled at Cleopatra’s death, as it deprived him of a
                    principal ornament in his intended triumph. However, the manner of it a good
                    deal exalted her character among the Romans, with whom ſuicide was conſidered as
                    a virtue. Her dying requeſt was complied with, her body being laid by Antony’s,
                    and a magnificent funeral prepared for her and her two faithful attendants.</p>
                <p>After having ſettled the affairs of Egypt, he leſt Alexandria in the beginning
                    of September, in the year of Rome 720, with a deſign to return through Syria,
                    Aſia Minor, and Greece, to Italy. On his arrival at Antioch, he found there
                    Tiridates, who had been raiſed to the throne of Parthia in oppoſition to
                    Phrahates, and likewiſe ambaſſadors from Phrahates, who were all come on the
                    ſame errand ; to wit, to ſolicit the aſſiſtance of the Romans againſt each
                    other. Octavianus gave a friendly anſwer both to Tiridates and the ambaſſadors
                    of Phrahates, without intending to help either ; but rather with a deſign to
                    animate the one againſt the other, and by that means to weaken both, ſo far as
                    to render the Parthian name no longer formidable to Rome. After this, having
                    appointed Meſſala</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0396" facs="gri_33125011196389_0402.tif"/>
                <p>Corvinus governor of Syria, he marched into the province of Aſia, properly ſo
                    called, and there took up his winter·quarters. He ſpent the whole winter in
                    ſettling the affairs of the ſeveral provinces of Aſia Minor and the adjacent
                    iſlands ; and early in the ſpring paſſed into Greece, whence he ſet out for
                    Rome, which he entered in the month Sextilis, afterwards called <hi
                        rend="italic"> Augufl,</hi> in three triumphs, which were celebrated ſor
                    three days together.</p>
                <p>And now Octavianus was at the height of his wiſhes, ſole ſovereign, ſole maſter,
                    of the whole Roman empire. But, on the other hand, the many dangers which attend
                    an uſurped powder, appearing to him in a ſtronger light than ever, filled his
                    mind with a thouſand perplexing thoughts. The natural aversion of the Romans to
                    a kingly government, their love of liberty, and the ides of March, when his
                    father Julius was murdered in full ſenate by thoſe very men whom he thought the
                    moſt devoted to his perſon, made him ſear there might ariſe another Brutus, who,
                    to reſtore liberty to his country, might aſſaſſinate him on his very throne.
                    This he knew had happened to Julius Cæſar; whereas Sylla, after having laid down
                    the authority he had uſurped, died peaceably in his bed in the midſt of his
                    enemies. The paſſion of ſear outweighed in his ſoul the charms of a diadem, and
                    inclined him to follow the example of Sylla. He was indeed very unwilling to
                    part with his authority ; but ſear began to get the better of his ambition.
                    However, before he came to any reſolution, he thought it adviſable to conſult
                    his two moſt intimate and truſty friends, Agrippa ând Mæcenas ; the former no
                    leſs famous for his probity than his valour ; and the latter a man of great
                    penetration, and generally eſteemed the moſt reſined politician of his age.
                    Agrippa enlarged on the" many and almoſt inevitable dangers which attend
                    monarchy, inſupportable to a free people, and to men educated in a commonwealth.
                    He did not forget the examples of'Sylla and Cæſar; and cloſed his ſpeech with
                    exhorting Octavianus to convince the world, by reſtoring liberty to his country,
                    that the only motive for his taking up arms was to revenge his father’s death.</p>
                <p>Mæcenas, on the other hand, remonſtrated to him, that he had done too much to go
                    back ; that, after ſo much bloodſhed, there could be no ſafety for him but on
                    the throne ; that, if he diveſted himſelf of the ſovereign power, he would be
                    immediately proſecuted by the children and friends of the many illuſtrious
                    perſons whom the misfortunes of the times had forced him to ſacriſice to his
                    ſafety ; that it was abſolutely neceſſary for the welfare and tranquillity of
                    the republic, that the ſovereign power ſhould be lodged in one perſon, not
                    divided among many, &amp;c. Octavianus thanked them both for their friendly
                    advice, but ſhowed himſelf inclined to follow the opinion of Mæcenas ; whereupon
                    that able miniſter gave him many wiſe inſtructions and rules of government,
                    which are related at length by Dio Caſſius, and will ever be looked upon as a
                    maſterpiece in politics. Among other things he told him, That he could not fail
                    of being ſucceſsful in all his undertakings, happy in his lifetimc, and famous
                    in hiſtory after his death, if he never deviated from this rule ; to wit, To
                    govern ethers as he would wiſh to be governed himſelf, had he been born to obey
                    and not to command. He added,</p>
                <p>That if, in taking upon him the ſovereign power, he dreaded the name of king, a
                    name ſo odious in a commonwealth, he might content himſelf with the title of <hi
                        rend="italic"> Caſar</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Imperator,</hi> and under
                    that name, which was well known to the Romans, enjoy all the authority of a
                    king.</p>
                <p>This advice Octavianus followed, and from that time laid aſide all thoughts of
                    abdicating the ſovereign power; but, to deceive the people into a belief that
                    they ſtill enjoyed their ancient government, he continued the old magiſtrates,
                    with the ſame name, pomp, and ornaments, but with juſt as much power as hc
                    thought fit to leave them. They were to have no military power, but only their
                    old juriſdiction of deciding finally all cauſes, except ſuch as were capital ;
                    and though ſome of theſe laſt were left to the governor of Rome, yet the chief
                    he reſerved for himſelf. He paid great court to the people : the very name that
                    covered his uſurpation was a compliment to them ; for he affected to call it the
                    power of the tribuneſhip, though he acted as abſolutely by it as if he had
                    called it the dictatorial power. He likewiſe won the hearts of the populace by
                    cheapneſs of proviſions and plentiful markets ; he frequently entertained them
                    with ſhows and ſports; and by theſe means-kept them in good-humour, and made
                    them forget uſurpation, ſlavery, and every public evil ; people in eaſe and
                    plenty being under no temptation of inquiring into the title of their prince, or
                    reſenting acts of power which they do not immediately feel.</p>
                <p>As for the ſenate, he filled it with his own creatures, raiſing the number of
                    the conſcript fathers to iooo. He ſupplied ſeveral poor ſenators with money out
                    of the treaſury to diſcharge the public offices, and on all occaſions affected
                    an high regard for that venerable body ; but at the ſame time diveſted them of
                    all power, and reduced them to mere cyphers. To prevent them from raiſing new’
                    diſturbances in the diſtant provinces, he iſſued an edict, forbidding any
                    ſenator to travel out of Italy without leave, except ſuch as had lands in
                    Sicily, or Narbonne Gaul, which at that time comprehended Languedoc, Provence,
                    and Dauphiny. To theſe provinces, which were near Italy, and in a perfect ſtate
                    of tranquillity, they had full liberty to retire when they pleaſed, and live
                    there upon their eſtates. Before he ended his ſixth conſulſhip, he took a cenſus
                    of the people, which was 41 years after the laſt ; and in this the number of the
                    men fit to bear arms amounted to 463,000, the greateſt that had ever been found
                    before. He likewiſe celebrated the games which had been decreed by the ſenate
                    for his victory at Actium ; and it was ordered, that they ſhould be celebrated
                    every fifth year, four colleges of prieſts being appointed to take care of them
                    ; to wit, the pontifices, the augurs, the ſeptemvirs, and quindecimvirs. The
                    more to gain the affections of the people, he annulled, by one edict, the many
                    ſevere and unjuſt laws which had been enacted during the triumvirate. He raiſed
                    many public buildings, repaired the old ones, and added many ſtately ornaments
                    to the city, which at this time was, if we may give credit to ſome ancient
                    writers, about 50 miles in compaſs, and contained near four millions of fouls,
                    reckoning men, women, children, and ſlaves. He attended buſineſs, reformed
                    abuſes, ſhowed great regard for the Roman name, procured public abundance,
                    pleaſure, and jollity,</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0397" facs="gri_33125011196389_0403.tif"/>
                <p>often appearing in perſon at the public diverſions, and in all things ſtudying
                    to render himſelſ dear to the populace.</p>
                <p>And now Octavianus, entering upon his ſeventh conſulſhip with M. Agrippa, the
                    third time conſiſt, and finding all things ripe for his deſign, the people being
                    highly pleaſed with his mild government, and the ſenate filled with his
                    creatures, whoſe fortunes depended upon his holding the power he had uſurped,
                    went by the advice of Agrippa and Mæcenas to the ſenate-houſe ; and there, in a
                    ſtudied ſpeech, offered to reſign his authority, and put all again into the
                    hands of the people upon the old foundation of the commonwealth ; being well
                    appriſed, that the greater part of the conſcript fathers, whoſe intereſts were
                    interwoven with his, would unanimouſiy preſs him to the contrary : Which
                    happened accordingly ; for they not only interrupted him while he was ſpeaking,
                    but, after he had done, unanimouſiy beſought him to take upon himſelf alone the
                    whole government of the Roman empire. He, with a ſeeming reluctance, yielded at
                    laſt to their requeſt, as if he had been compelled to accept of the ſovereignt.
                    By this artifice he compaſſed his deſign, which was, to get the power and
                    authority, which he had uſurped, confiιmed to him by the ſenate and people for
                    the ſpace of io years : for he would not accept of it for a longer term,
                    pretending he ſhould in that time be able to ſettle all things in ſuch peace and
                    order that there would be no further need of his authority ; but that he might
                    then eaſe himſelf of the burden, and put the government again into the hands of
                    the ſenate and people. This method he took to render the yoke leſs heavy ; but
                    with a deſign to renew his leaſe, if we may be allowed the expreſſion, as ſoon
                    as the ten years were expired ; which he did accordingly from ten years to ten
                    years as long as he lived, all the while governing the whole Roman empire with
                    an abſolute and uncontrouled power. With this new authority the ſenate reſolved
                    to diſtinguiſh him with a new name. Some of the conſcript fathers propoſed the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Romulus,</hi> thereby to import that he was another
                    founder of Rome; others offered other titles ; but the venerable name of <hi
                        rend="italic"> Auguſtus,</hi> propoſed by Manutius Plancus, ſeemed
                    preferable to all the reſt, as it expreſſed more dignity and reverence than
                    authority, the moſt ſacred things, ſuch as temples, and places conſecrated by
                    augurs, being termed by the Romans <hi rend="italic">Auguſta.</hi> Octavianus
                    himſell was inclined to aſſume the name of <hi rend="italic">Romulus ;</hi> but, ſearing he ſhould be ſuſpected of affecting the kingdom, he declined it,
                    and took that of <hi rend="italic">Auguſtus,</hi> by which we ſhall henceforth
                    diſtinguiſh him.</p>
                <p>Though the whole power of the ſenate and people was now veſted in Auguſtus, yet,
                    that he might ſeem to ſhare it with the conſcript fathers, he reſuſed to govern
                    all the provinces ; aſſigning to the ſenate ſuch as were quiet and peaceable;
                    and keeping to himſelf thoſe which, bordering upon barbarous nations, were moſt
                    expoſed to troubles and wars, ſaying, He deſired the fathers might enjoy their
                    power with eaſe and ſafety, while he underwent all the dangers and labours :
                    but, by this politic conduct, he ſecured all the military power to himſelf ; the
                    troops lying in the provinces he had choſen ; and the others, which were
                    governed by the ſenate, being quite deſtitute of ſc.rces. The latter were called <hi rend="italic">ſenatorial,</hi> and the former <hi rend="italic">imperial,</hi> provinces. O∙ ver the provinces of both ſorts were ſet men
                    of diſtinction, to wit, ſuch as had been conſuls or prætors, with the titles of <hi rend="italic">proconſul</hi> and <hi rend="italic">proprietor ;</hi> but the government of Egypt was committed to a private knight, Auguſtus ſearing
                    left a perſon of rank, depending upon the wealth and ſituation of that country,
                    might raiſe new diſturbances in the empire. All theſe governors held their
                    employment only for a year, and were upon the arrival of their ſucceſſors to
                    depart their provinces immediately, and not fail to be at Rome within three
                    months at the fartheſt. This diviſion of the provinces was made, according to
                    Ovid, on the ides of January ; whereas he was veſted by the ſenate and people
                    with the ſovereign power on the ſeventh of the ides of the ſame month, as is
                    manifeſt from the Narbonne marbles ; and ſrom that time many writers date the
                    years of his empire. Thus ended the greateſt commonwealth, and at the ſame time
                    began the greateſt monarchy, that had ever been known ; a monarchy which
                    infinitely excelled in power, riches, extent; and continuance, all the empires
                    which had preceded it..</p>
                <p>It comprehended the greateſt and by ſar the beſt part of Europe, Aſia, and
                    Aſrica, being near 4000 miles in length, and about half as much fin breadth. As
                    to the yearly revenues of the empire, they have by a moderate computation been
                    reckoned to amount to forty millions of our money. But the Romans themſelves now
                    ran hodlong into all manner of luxury and effeminacy. The people were become a
                    mere mob ; thoſe who w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> ere wont to direct mighty wars,
                    to raiſe and depoſe great kings, to beſtow or take away potent empires, were ſe
                    ſunk and debauched, that, if they had but bread and ſhows, their ambition went
                    no higher. The nobility were indeed more polite than in former ages; but at the
                    ſame time idle, venal, vicious, inſenſible of private virtue, utter .ſtrangers
                    to public glory or diſgrace, void of zeal for the welfare of their country, and
                    ſolely intent on gaining the favour of the emperor, as knowing that certain
                    wealth and preferment were the rewards of ready ſubmiſſion, acquieſcence, and
                    flattery. No wonder, therefore, that they loſt their liberty, without being ever
                    again able to retrieve it.</p>
                <p>Auguſtus, now abſolute maſter of the Roman empire, took all methods to
                    ingratiate himſelf with his ſoldiers, by whoſe means he had attained ſuch a
                    height of power. With this view, he diſperſed them through different parts of
                    Iζaly in 32 colonies, that he might the more eaſily reaſſemble them on proper
                    occaſions. He kept 25 legions conſtantly on foot, 17 of which were in Europe ;
                    viz. eight on the Rhine, four on the Danube, three in Spain, and two in
                    Dalmatia. The other eight were ſent into Aſia and Africa ; four of them being
                    quartered in the neighbourhood of the Euphrates, two in Egypt, and two in Africa
                    Propria, that is, the ancient dominions of Carthage. All theſe forces, amounting
                    to 170,650 men, were conſtantly kept on foot by the Roman emperors for ſeveral
                    ages. In the neighbourhood of Rome were always quartered 12 co-· horts, that is,
                    about 10,∞0 men ; nine of which were called <hi rend="italic">prœtorian cohorts
                        ;</hi> the other three, <hi rend="italic">city cohorts.</hi> Theſe were
                    eſtabliſhed as a guard to the emperor, and. to maintain peace and tranquillity
                    in the city, but had· oſten a great ſhail* in the diſturbances which took place
                    throughout the empire. Beſides theſe, Auguſtus con-,· fiant ly kept at ſea two
                    powerful navies ; the one riding.</p>

                <p>nt anchor near Ravenna in the Adriatic ſea, to command Dalmatia, Greece, Cyprus,
                    and the reſt of the eaſtern provinces ; the other at Miſenum in the
                    Mediterranean, to keep in awe the weſtern parts of the empire. They were
                    likewiſe to keep the ſeas clear of pirates, to convoy the veſſels which brought
                    to Rome the annual tributes ſrom the provinces beyond ſea, and to tranſport corn
                    and other proviſions neceſſary for the relief and ſeibſiſtence of the city. As
                    to the civil government, Auguſtus enacted ſeveral new laws, and reformed ſome of
                    the old ones : however, he affected to do nothing without the advice of the
                    ſenate ; who were ſo well pleaſed with the complaiſance ſhowed them on all
                    oc-caſtons, that to the reſt of his titles they added that of <hi rend="italic">Pater Patrice,</hi> or “ Father of his Country.”</p>
                <p>And now Auguſtus having ſettled all things with regard to the civil and military
                    eſtabliſhments. of the empire, turned his arms againſt the Spaniſh nations
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Cantabrians</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aſturians,</hi> who had never been fully ſubdued. The war, however,
                    terminated as uſual, in ſavour of the Romans ; and theſe brave nations were
                    forced to receive the yoke, though not without the moſt violent reſiſtance on
                    their part, and the utmoſt difficulty on that of the Romans (SeeAsturia). By
                    this and his other conqueſts the name of <hi rend="italic">A</hi> uguſtus
                    became ſo celebrated, that his friendſhip was courted by the moſt diſtant
                    monarchs. Phrahates king of Parthia conſented to a treaty with him upon his own
                    terms, and gave him four of his own ſons with theſe wives and children as
                    hoſtages for the performance of the articles ; and as a ſurther inſtance of his
                    reſpect, he delivered up the Roman eagles and other enſigns which had been taken
                    from Craflus at the battle of Carrhæ. He received alſo an embaſſy from the king
                    of India, with a letter written in the Greek tongue, in which the Indian monarch
                    informed him, that “ though he reigned over 6oc kings, he had ſo great a value
                    for the friendſhip of A uguſtus, that he had ſent this embaſſy on ſo long a
                    journey on purpoſe to deſire it of him ; that he was ready to meet him at
                    whatſoever place he pleaſed to appoint ; and that, upon the firſt notice, he was
                    ready to afliſt him in whatever was right.” This letter he ſubſeribed by the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Poms king of India.</hi> Of the ambaſſadors who ſet
                    out from India, three only reached the preſence of Auguſtus, who was at that
                    time in the iſland of Samos, the others dying by the way, Of the three
                    ſiirvivors one was names <hi rend="italic">Zarτnar,</hi> a gymnoſophſſi, who
                    followed the emperor to Athens, and there burnt himſelf in his preſence ; it
                    being cuftemary for the gymnoſophifts to put an end to their lives in this
                    manner, when they thought they had lived long enough, or apprehended ſome
                    misfortune. Soon alter this the Roman dominions were extended ſouthward over the
                    Garamantes, a people whoſe country reached as far as the river Niger. All this
                    time the emperor continued to make new regulations for the good of the ſtate ;
                    and among other things cauſed the Sibylline oracles to be reviewed. Many of
                    theſe he rejected ; but ſuch as were reckoned authentic, he cauſed to be copied
                    by the pontifices themſelves, and lodged them in golden cabinets, which he
                    placed in the temple of Apollo, built by him in his palace.</p>
                <p>The Roman empire had now extAded itſelf ſo far, that it ſeemed to have arrived
                    at the limits preſcribed to it by nature ; and as ſoon as this was the caſe, it
                    began to be attacked by thoſe nations which in proceſs of time were to overthrow
                    it. The Germans, by which name the Romans confounded a great number of nations
                    dwelling in the northern parts of Europe, began to make incurſions into Gaul.
                    Their firſl attempt happened in the year 17 B. C. when they at firſl gained an
                    inconfιderable advantage, but were ſoon driven back with great loſs. Soon after
                    this the Rhae-ti, who ſeem to have inhabited the country bordering on the lake
                    of Confiance, invaded Italy, where they committed dreadful devaſtations, putting
                    all the males to the ſw ord without diſtinction of rank or age ; nay, we are
                    told, that, when women with child happened to fall into their hands, they
                    conſulted their augurs whether the child was male or female ; and if they
                    pronounced it a male, the mother was immediately maſſacred. Againſt theſe
                    barbarians Auguftιιs ſent Druſus the ſecond ſon of the empreſs Livia ; who,
                    though very young, found means to gain a complete victory with very little loſs
                    on his part. Thoſe who eſeaped took the road to Gaul, being joined by the
                    Vindelici, another nation in the neighbourhood ; but Tiberius, the elder brother
                    of Druſus, marched againſt them, and overthrew them ſo completely, that the
                    Rhse-ti, Vindelici, and Norici, three of the moſt barbarous nations in thoſe
                    parts, were fain to ſubmit to the pleaſure of the emperor. To keep their country
                    in awe, Tiberius planted tw <hi rend="sup">,</hi> o colonies in Vindelicia,
                    opening a road from thence into Noricum and Rhsetia. One of the cities which he
                    built for the defence of his colonies was called <hi rend="italic">Dryfomagus ;</hi> the other, <hi rend="italic">Auguſta Pindelico-rum ;</hi> both of which
                    are now known by the names of <hi rend="italic">Niminghen</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic"> Augjburg.</hi></p>
                <p>Auguſtus, who had long ſince obtained all the temporal honours which could well
                    be conferred upon him, now began to aſſume thoſe of the ſpiritual kind alſo ;
                    being in the year 13 B. C. created Pontifex Maximus : an office which he
                    continued to hold till his death ; as did alſo his ſucceſſors till the time of
                    The-odofius. By virtue of this office he corrected a very groſs miſſake in the
                    Roman kalendar ; for the pontifices having, for the ſpace of 36 years, that is,
                    ever ſince the reformation by Julius Caeſar, made every third year a leap year,
                    inſtead of every fourth, twelve days had been inſerted inſtead of nine, ſo that
                    the Roman year conſiſted of three days more than it ought to have done. Theſe
                    three ſuperfluous days having been thrown out, the form of the year has“ ever
                    ſince been regularly obſerved, and is ſtill known by the name of the <hi
                        rend="italic"> old ſtyle</hi> in uſe among us. On this occaſion he gave his
                    own name to the month of Auguſt, as Julius Cæſar had formerly done to the month
                    of July.</p>
                <p>In the year 11 B. C. Agrippa died, and was ſucceeded in his high employment of
                    governor of Rome by Tiberius ; but, before inveſting him with this ample power,
                    the emperor cauſed him to divorce his wife A-grippina (who had already brought
                    him a ſon, and w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> as then big with child), in order to
                    marry Julia the widow of Agrippa and daughter of the emperor. Julia was a
                    princeſs of an infamous character, as was known to almoſt every body excepting
                    Auguſtus himſelf; however, Tiberius made no heſitation, through ſear of
                    disobliging the emperor.</p>
                <p>The emperor now ſent his two ſons Tiberius and Druſus againſt the northern
                    nations. Tiberius redu-</p>

                <p>ced the Pannom’ans, who had attempted to ſhake off the yoke after the death of
                    Agrippa. Druſus performed great exploits in Germany ; but while he was
                    conſidering whether he ſhould penetrate further into theſe northern countries,
                    he was ſeized with a violent fever, which carried him off in a few days. He was
                    ſucceeded in his command by Tiberius, who is reported to have done great things,
                    but certainly made no permanent conqueſts in Germany. However, he w <hi
                        rend="sup"> ,</hi> as honoured with a triumph, and had the tribunitial
                    power for five years conferred upon him; which was no ſooner done, than, to the
                    great ſurpriſe of Auguſtus and the whole city, he deſired leave to quit Rome and
                    retire to Rhodes. Various reaſens have been aſſigned for this extraordinary
                    reſolution : ſome are of opinion that it was in order to avoid being an
                    eye-witneſs of the debaucheries of his wiſe Julia, who ſet no bounds to her
                    lewdneſs ; though others imagine that he was offended at the honours which
                    Auguſtus had conferred on his grandchildren, eſpecially at his ſtyling them <hi
                        rend="italic"> princes of the Roman youth ;</hi> which left him no hopes of
                    enjoying the ſovereign power. However, Auguſtus poſitiveiy refuſed to comply
                    with his requeſt, and ſes mother Livia uſed her utmoſt endeavours to diſſuade
                    him from his reſolution : but Tiberius continued obſtinate ; and finding all
                    other means ineffectual, at laſt ſhut himſelf up in his houſe, where he
                    abſtained four whole days from nouriſhment. Auguſtus, perceiving that he could
                    not get the better of his obſtinate and inflexible temper, at laſt complied with
                    his requeſt. Tiberius ſoon 'grew weary of his retirement, and, giving out that
                    he had left Rome only to avoid giving umbrage to the emperor’s two
                    grandchildren, deſired leave to return ; but Auguſtus was ſo much diſpleaſed
                    with his having obſtinately inſiſted on leaving Rome, that he obliged him to
                    remain at Rhodes ſor ſeven years longer. His mother,, with much ado got him
                    declared the emperor’s lieutenant in thoſe parts ; but Tiberius, dreading the
                    reſentment of his father-in-law’, continued to act as a private perſon during
                    the whole time of his ſtay there..</p>
                <p>A profound peace now reigned throughout the whole empire ; and in conſequence of
                    this the temple of Janus 'was ſhut, which had never before happened ſince the
                    time of Numa Pompilius. During this pacific interval, the Saviour of mankind was
                    born in Judaea, as is recorded in the ſacred hiſtory, 748 years after the
                    foundation of Rome by Romulus. Three years after, Tiberius returned to the city,
                    by permiſſion of Auguſtus, who yet would not allow him to bear any public office
                    ; but in a ſhort time, Lucius Cæſar, one of the emperor’s grandchildren, died,
                    not without ſuſpicions of his being poiſoned by Livia. Tiberius ſhow-ed ſuch
                    great concern for his death, that the affection of Auguſtus for him returned ;
                    and it is ſaid that he w <hi rend="sup">r</hi> ould at that time have adopted
                    Tiberius, had it not been for giving umbrage to his other grandſon Caius Cæſar.
                    This obſtacle, however, was ſoon after removed ; Caius being taken off alſo, not
                    without great ſuſpicions of Livia, as well as in the former caſe. Auguſtus w <hi
                        rend="sup"> ,</hi> as exceedingly concerned at his death,, and immediately
                    adopted Tiberius as his ſon; but adopted alſo Agrippa Poſthumius, the third ſon
                    of the famous Agrippa ; and obliged Tiberius to adopt Germanicus the ſon of his
                    brother Druſus, though he had a ſon of his own named <hi rend="italic">Drujus ;</hi> which was a great mortification to hint, As to Agrippa, however, who might
                    have been an occafιon of jealouſy, Tiberius was ſoon freed from him, by his
                    diſgrace and baniſhment, which very ſoon took place, but on what account is not
                    known.</p>
                <p>The northern nations now began to turn formidable : and though it is pretended
                    that Tiberius was always ſucceſsful againſt them, yet about this time they gave
                    the Romans a moſt terrible overthrow ; three legions and fix cohorts, under
                    Quintilius Varus, being almoſt entirely cut in pieces. Auguſtus ſet nσ bounds to
                    his grief on this fatal occaſion. For ſome months he let his hair and beard
                    grow, frequently tearing his garments, knocking his head againſt the wall, and
                    crying out like a diffracted perſon, “ Reſtore the legions, Varus!” Tiberius,
                    however, was ſoon after ſent into Germany ; and for his exploits there he was
                    honoured with.a triumph. Auguſtus now took him. for his colleague in the
                    ſovereignty ; after which he ſent Germanicus againſt the northern barbarians,
                    and Tiberius into Illyricum. This was the laſt of his public acts ; for having
                    accompanied Tiberius for part of his journey, he died at Nola in Campania, in
                    the 76th year of his age, and 56th of his reign. Livia was ſuſpected ef having
                    haſtened his death by giving him. poiſoned figs. . Her reaſon for this was, that
                    ſhe feared a reconciliation between him and his grandſon Agrippa whom he had
                    baniſhed, as we have already related. Some months before, the emperor had paid a
                    viſit to Agrippa, unknown to Livia, Tiberius, or any other perſon, excepting one
                    Fabius Maximus.. This man, on his return home, diſcovered the ſecret to his
                    wife, and ſhe to the empreſs. Auguſtus then perceiving that Fabius had betrayed
                    him, was ſo provoked, that he baniſhed him from his preſence for ever ; upon
                    which the unfortunate Fabius, unable to ſurvive his diſgrace, laid violent hands
                    on himſelſe</p>
                <p>Tiberius, who ſucceeded to the empire, reſolved to ſecure himſelf on the throne
                    by the murder of Agrippa; whom accordingly he cauſed to be put to death by a
                    military tribune. Though this might have been a ſuf-ficient evidence of what the
                    Romans had to expect, the death of Auguſtus was no ſooner known, than the
                    conſuls, ſenators, and knights, to uſe the expreſſion of Tacitus, ran headlong
                    into ſlavery. The two conſuls firſt took an oath of fidelity to the emperor, and
                    then adminiſtered it to the ſenate, the people, and the ſoldiery. Tiberius
                    behaved in a dark myſterious manner, taking care to rule with an abſolute ſway,
                    but at the ſame time ſeeming to heſitate whether he ſhould accept the ſovereign
                    power or not ; inſomuch that one of the ſenators took the liberty to tell him,
                    that other men <hi rend="sup">v</hi> were flow in performing what they had
                    promiſed, but he was flow in promiſing what he had already per-formed. At laſt,
                    however, his modeſty was overcome, and he declared his acceptance of the
                    ſovereignty in the following words: “ Laccept the empire, and will hold it, till
                    ſuch time as you, conſcript fathers, in your great prudence, ſhall think proper
                    to give repoſe to my old age.”</p>
                <p>Tiberius had ſcarce taken poſſeſſion of the throne, when news were brought him
                    that the armies in Pan-nonia and Germany had mutinied. In Pannonia, three
                    legions having been allowed ſome days of relaxation from their uſual duties,
                    either to mourn for the death of χ∖uguſtus, or to rejoice for the acceſſion of
                    Tiberius, grew turbulent and ſeditious. The Pannonian muti-</p>

                <p>rteers were headed by one PercenιuuS, a common ſoldier ; who, before he ſerved
                    in the army, had made it his whole buſineſs to form parties in the theatres and
                    play houſes to hiſs or applaud ſuch actors as he liked or diſliked. Inflamed by
                    the ſpeeches of this man, they openly revolted ; and though Tiberius himſelf
                    wrote to them, and lent his ſon Druſus to endeavour to quell the tumult, they
                    maſſacred ſome of their officers, and inſulted others, till at laſt, being
                    frightened by an eclipſe of the moon, they began to ſhow ſome ſigns of
                    repentance. Of this favourable diſpofιtion Druſus took advantage ; and even got
                    the ringleaders of the revolt condemned and executed. Immediately after this
                    they were again terrified by ſuch violent ſtorms and dreadful rains, that they
                    quietly ſubmitted, and every thing in that quarter was reſtored to tranquillity.</p>
                <p>The revolt of the German legions threatened much more danger, as they were more
                    numerous than thoſe of Pannonia. They proceeded nearly in the ſame way as the
                    Pannonian legions, falling upon their officers, eſpecially the centurions, and
                    beating them till they almoſt expired, drove them out of the camp, and ſome of
                    them were even thrown into the Rhine. Germanicus, who was at that time in Gaul,
                    haſtened to the camp on the firſt news of the diſturbance ; but being unable to
                    prevail on them to return to their duty, he was obliged to feign letters from
                    Tiberius, granting all their demands. Theſe werc, That all thoſe who had ſerved
                    20 years ſhould be diſeharged 5 that ſuch as had ſerved 16 ſhould be deemed
                    veterans; and that ſome legacies which had been left them by Auguſtus ſhoiild
                    not only be paid immediately, but doubled. This laſt article he was obliged to
                    diſcharge without delay out of the money which he and hi3 friends had brought to
                    defray the expences of their journey ; and on receiving it, the troops quietly
                    retired to their winter-quarters. But, in the mean time, ſome deputies ſent
                    either by Tiberius or the ſenate, probably to quell the ſedition, occaſioned
                    freſh diſturbances ; for the legionaries, taking it into their heads that theſe
                    deputies were come to revoke the conceſſions which Germanicus had made, were
                    with difficulty prevented from tearing them in pieces ; and, notwithſtanding the
                    utmoſt endeavours of Germanicus, behaved in ſuch an outrageous manner, that the
                    general thought proper to ſend off his wiſe Agrippina, with her infant ſon
                    Claudius, ſhe herſelf at the ſame being big with child. As ihe was attended by
                    many women of diſtinction, wives of the chief officers in the camp, their tears
                    and lamentations in parting with their huſhands occaſioned a great uproar, and
                    drew together the ſoldiers from all quarters. A new ſcene enſued, which made an
                    impreſſion even upon the moſt obſtinate. They could not behold, without ſhame
                    and compaſſion, ſo many women of rank travelling thus forlorn, without a
                    centurion to attend them, or a ſoldier to guard them ; and their general’s wiſe
                    among the teſt, carrying her infant child in her arms, and preparing to fly ſor
                    ſhelter againſt the treachery of the Roman legions. This made ſuch a deep
                    impreſſion on the minds of many of them, that ſome ran to ſtop her, while the
                    reſt recurred to Germanicus, earneſtly intreating him to recall his wiſe, and to
                    prevent her from being obliged to ſeek a ſanctuary among foreigners. The general
                    improved this favourable diſpoſition, and in a ſhort time they of their own
                    accord ſeized and maſſacred the ringleaders of the revolt. Still, however, two
                    of the legions continued in their difobedi-ence. Againſt them therefore
                    Germanicus determined to lead thoſe who had returned to their duty. With this
                    view he prepared veſſels ; but before he embarked his troops, he wrote a letter
                    to Cagcina who commanded them, acquainting him that he approached with a
                    powerful army, reſolved to put them all to the ſword without diſtinction, if
                    they did not prevent him by taking vengeance on the guilty themſelves. This
                    letter Caecina communicated only to the chief officers and ſuch of the ſoldiets
                    as had all along diſapproved of the revolt, exhorting them at the fame time to
                    enter into an aſſociation againſt the ſeditious, and put to the ſword ſuch as
                    had involved them in the preſent ignominy and guilt. This propoſal was approved
                    of, and a cruel maſſacre immediately took place ; inſomuch that when Germanicus
                    came to the camp, he found the greateſt part of the legions deſtroyed. This
                    greatly affected the humane Germanicus, who cauſed the bodies of the ſlain to be
                    burnt, and celebrated their obſequies with the uſual ſolemnities ; however, the
                    ſedition was thus effectually quelled, after which he led his army into Germany.
                    There he performed many great exploits<note anchored="true" place="margin"
                        type="suthorial">See <hi rend="italic">Germany.</hi></note>; but ſtill all
                    that he could perform was far from freeing the empire from ſo dangerous and
                    trouble-ſome an enemy. In the year 19, he died, of poiſon, as was ſuppoſed,
                    given by Piſo, his partner in the government of Syria, to which Germanicus had
                    been promoted after his return from the north.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, Tiberius, though he affected to court the favour of the people
                    by various methods, yet ſhowed himſelf in general ſuch a cruel and blood-thirſty
                    tyrant, that he became the object of univerſal abhorrence. Though he had hated
                    Germanicus in his heart, he puniſhed Piſo with death ; but in about a year after
                    the death of Germanicus, having now no object of jealouſy to keep him in awe,
                    he" began to pull off the'maſli, and appear more in his natural character than
                    before. He took upon himſelf the interpretation of all political meaſures, and
                    began daily to diminiſh the authority of the ſenate ; which deſign was much
                    facilitated, by their own aptitude to ſlavery ; ſo that he deſpiſed their
                    meanneſs, while he enjoyed its effects. A law at that time ſubliſted, which made
                    it treaſon to form any injurious attempt againſt the ,majefty of the people.
                    Tiberius aſſumed to himſelf the interpretation and enforcement of this law ; and
                    extended it not only to the caſes which really affected the ſafety of the ſtate,
                    but to every conjuncture that could poſſibly be favourable to his hatred or
                    ſuſpicions. All freedom was now therefore baniſhed from convivial meetings, and
                    diffidence reigned amongſt the deareſt relations. The law of offended majeſty
                    being revived, many perſons of diſtinction fell a ſacriſice to it.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of theſe cruelties, Tiberius took into his confidence Sejanus,
                    a Roman knight, but by birth a Volſcian, who found out the method of gaining his
                    confidence, by the moſt refined degree of diſſimulation, being an over-match for
                    his maſter in his own arts. He was made by tſhe emperor captain of the Prætotian
                    guards, one of the moſt confidential truſts in the ſtate, and extolled in the
                    ſenate as a worthy aſſociate in his labours. The ſervile ſenators, with</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0401" facs="gri_33125011196389_0407.tif"/>
                <p>ready adulation, ſet up the ſtatues of the favourite be-ſide thoſe of Tiberius,
                    and ſeemed eager to pay him ſimilar honours. It is not well known whether he was
                    the adviſer of all the cruelties that enſued ſoon after ; but certain it is,
                    that, from the beginning of his miniſtry, Tiberius ſeemed to become more fatally
                    ſu-ſpicious.</p>
                <p>It was ſrom ſuch humble beginnings that this miniſter even ventured to aſpire at
                    the throne, and was reſolved to make the emperor’s fooliſh conſidence one of the
                    firſt ſteps to his ruin. However, he conſidered that cutting off Tiberius alone
                    would rather retard than promote his deſigns while his ſon Druſus and the
                    children of Germanicus were yet remaining. He therefore began by corrupting
                    Livia, the wiſe of Druſus ; whom, after having debauched her, he prevailed upon
                    to poiſon her huſhand. This was effected by means of a flow poifon (as we are
                    told), which gave his death the appearance of a caſual diſtemper. Tiberius, in
                    the mean time, either naturally phlegmatic, or at leaſt not much regarding his
                    ſon, bore his death with great tranquillity. He was even heard to jell upon the
                    occaſion; for when the ambaſſadors from Troy came ſomewhat late with their
                    compliments of condolence, he anſwered their pretended diſtreſſes, by condoling
                    with them alſo upon the loſs of Hector.</p>
                <p>Sejanus having ſucceeded in this, was reſolved to make his next attempt upon the
                    children of Germanicus, who were undoubted ſucceffors to the empire. However, be
                    was fruſtrated in his deſigns, both with regard to the fidelity of their
                    governors, and the chaſ-tity of Agrippina their mother. Whereupon he reſolved
                    upon changing his aims, and removing Tiberius out of the city ; by which means
                    he expected more frequent opportunities of putting his deſigns into execution.
                    He therefore uſed all his addreſs to perſuade Tiberius to retire to ſome
                    agreeable retreat, remote from Rome. By this he expected many advantages, ſince
                    there could be no acceſs to the emperor but by him. Thus all letters being
                    conveyed to the prince by ſoldiers at his own devotion, they would paſs through
                    his hands ; by which means he muſt in time become the ſole governor of the
                    empire, and at laſt be in a capacity of removing all obſtacles to his ambition.
                    He now therefore began to inſinuate to Tiberius the great and numerous
                    inconveniences of the city, the fatigues of attending the ſenate, and the
                    ſeditious temper of the inferior citizens of Rome. Tiberius, either prevailed
                    upon by his perſuaſions, or purſuing the natural turn of his temper, which led
                    to indolence and debauchery, in the twelfth year of his reign left Rome, and
                    went into Campania, under pretence of dedicating temples to Jupiter and
                    Auguſtus. After this, though he removed to ſeveral places, he never returned to
                    Rome ; but ſpent the greateſt part of his time in the iſland of Caprea, a place
                    which was rendered as infamous by his pleaſures as deteſtable by bis cruelties,
                    which were ſhoeking to human nature. Buried in this retreat, he gave himſelf up
                    to his pleaſures, quite regardleſs of the miſeries of his ſubjects. Thus an
                    inſurrection of the Jews, upon placing his ſtatue in Jeruſalem, under the
                    government of Pontius Pilate, gave him no ſort of uneaſineſs. The falling of an
                    amphitheatre at Fidenæ, in which ço,ooo perſons were either killed or wounded,
                    no way affected his repoſe. He was only employed in ſtudying how</p>
                <p>to vary his odious pleaſures, and forcing his feeble frame, ſhattered by age and
                    former debaucheries, into the enjoyment of them. Nothing can preſent a more
                    horrid picture than the retreat of this impure old man <hi rend="sub">r</hi> attended by all the miniſters of his perverted appetites. He was at this time 67
                    years old ; his perſon was moſt diſpleaſing ; and ſome ſay the diſagreeableneſs
                    of it, in a great meaſure, drove him into retirement. He. was quite bald before
                    ; his face was all broke out into ulcers, and covered over with plaſters ; his
                    body was bowed forward, while its extreme height and leanneſs increaſed its
                    deformity. With ſuch a perſon, and a mind ſtill more hideous, being gloomy,
                    ſuſpicious, and cruel, he ſat down with a view rather of forcing his appetites
                    than ſatisfying them. He ſpent whole nights in debaucheries at the table ; and
                    he appointed Pomponius Flaccus and Lucius Piſo to the firſt poſts of the empire,
                    for no other merit than that of having ſat up with him two days and two nights
                    without interruption. Theſe he called his friends of all hours. He made one
                    Novelius Torgnatus a praetor for being able to drink off five bottles of wine at
                    a draught. His luxuries of another kind were ſtill more deteſtable, and ſeemed
                    to increaſe with his drunkenneſs and gluttony. He made the moſt eminent women of
                    Rome ſubſervient to his lulls ; and all his inventions only ſeemed calculated
                    how to make his vices more extravagant and abominable. Tſe numberleſs obſcene
                    medals dug up in that iſiand at this day bear witneſs at once to his ſhame, and
                    the veracity of the hiſtorians who have deſcribed his debaucheries. In ſhort, in
                    this retreat, which was ſurrounded with rocks on every ſide, he quite gave up
                    the buſineſs of the empire ; or, if he was ever .active, it was only to do
                    miſchief. But, ſrom the time of his retreat, he became more cruel, and Sejanus
                    always endeavoured to increaſe his diſtruſts. Secret ſpies and informers were
                    placed in all parts of the city, who converted the moſt harmleſs actions into
                    ſubjects of offence. If any perſon of merit teſtiſied any concern for the glory
                    of the empire, it was immediately con-ſtrued into a deſign to obtain it. If
                    another ſpoke with regret of former liberty, he was ſuppofed to aim at
                    re-eſtabliſhing the commonwealth. Every action became liable to forced
                    interpretations ; joy expreſſed an hope of the prince’s death ; melancholy, an
                    envying of his proſperity. Sejanus found his ai n every day ſucceeding ; the
                    wretched emperor’s terrors were an inſtrument that he wrought upon at his
                    pleaſure, and by which he levelled every obſtacle to his deſigns. But the chief
                    objects of his jealouſy were the children of Germanicus, whom he reſolved to put
                    out of the way. He therefore continued to render them obnoxious to the emperor,
                    to alarm him with falſe reports of their ambition, and to terrify them with
                    alarms of his intended cruelty. By theſe means, he ſo contrived to widen the
                    breach, that he actually produced on both ſides thoſe diſpoſitions which he
                    pretended to obviate ; till at length, the two princes Nero and Druſus were
                    declared enemies to the ſtate, and afterwards ſtarved to death in priſon ; while
                    Agrippina their mother was ſent into baniſhment.</p>
                <p>In this manner Sejanus proceeded, removing all who ſtood between him and the
                    empire, and every day increaſing in conſidence with Tiberius, and power with the
                    ſenate. The number of his ſtatues exceeded even</p>

                <p>thoſe of the emperor ; people ſwore by his fortune, in the ſame manner as they
                    would have done had he been actually upon the throne, and he was more dreaded
                    than even the tyrant who actually enjoyed the empire. But the rapidity of his
                    riſe ſeemed only preparatory to the greatneſs of his downfall. All we know of
                    his firſt diſgrace with the emperor is, that Satrius Sec un dus was the man who
                    had the boldneſs to accuſe him. Antonia, the mother of Germanicus, ſeconded the
                    accuſation. What were the particulars of his crimes, we cannot learn ; but
                    certain it is, that he attempted to uſurp the empire, by aiming at the life of
                    Tiberius. He was very near diſpatching hi n, when his practices were diſcovered,
                    and his ow <hi rend="sup">,</hi> n life was ſubſtituted ſor that againſt which
                    he aimed. Tiberius, ſenſible of the traitor’s power, proceeded with his uſual
                    diſſimulation in having him apprehended. He granted hin new honours at the very
                    time he reſolved his death, and took him as his colleague in the conſulſhip. The
                    emperor’s letter to the ſenate began only with flight complaints againſt his
                    ſriend, but ended with an order for putting him in priſon. He intreated the
                    ſenators to protect a poor old &gt;an, as he was, abandoned by all; and, in
                    the ιrean ti ce, prepared ſhips ſor his flight, and ordered ſoldiers ſor his
                    ſecurity. The ſenate, who had long been jealous of the favourite’s power, and
                    dreaded his cruelty, immediately took this ορροί tunity of going beyond their
                    orders. Inſtead of ſentencing him to impriſonment, they directed his execution.
                    A ſtrange revolution now appeared in the city ; of thoſe numbers that but a
                    moment before were preſſing into the preſence of Sejanus, with offers of ſervice
                    and adulation, not one was found that would ſeem to be of his acquaintance : he
                    was deſerted by all ; and thoſe who had formerly received the greateſt benefits
                    ſrom him, ſeemed now converted into his moſt inveterate enemies. As he was
                    conducting to execution,· the people loaded him with inſult and execration. He
                    attempted to hide his face with his hands ; but even this was denied him, and
                    his hands were ſecured. Nor did the rage of his enemies ſub-ſide with his death
                    ; his body was ignominiouſly dragged about the ſtreets, and his whole family
                    executed with him.</p>
                <p>His death only lighted up the emperor’s rage for further executions. The priſons
                    were crowded with pretended accomplices in the conſpiracy of Sejanus. Tiberius
                    began to grow weary of particular executions ; he therefore gave orders that all
                    the accuſed ſhould be put to death together without further examination. Of 20
                    ſenators, whom he choſe for his council, he put 16 to death. “ Let them hate me
                    (cried he) ſo long as they obey me.” He then averred, that Priam was an happy
                    man, who outlived all his poſterity. In this manner there was not a day without
                    ſome barbarous execution, in which the ſufferers were obliged to undergo the
                    moſt ſhameftil indignities and exquiſite torments. When one Camillus had killed
                    himſelf to avoid the torture “ Ah (cried Tiberius), how that man has been able
                    to eſeape me!” When a priſoner earneſtly intreated that he would not defer his
                    death : “ No (cried the tyrant), I am not ſufficiently your friend, to ſharten
                    your torment.” He often ſatisfied his eyes with the tortures of the wretches
                    that were put to death before him ; and in the days of Suetonius the rock was to
                    be ſeen, from which he ordered ſuch as had diſpleaſed him to be thrown headlong.
                    As he was one day examining ſome perſons upon the rack, he was told that an old
                    friend of his was come from Rhodes to ſee him. Tiberius ſuppofing him brought
                    for the purpoſe of information, immediately ordered him to the torture ; and
                    when he was convinced of his miſtake, he ordered him to be put to death, to
                    prevent farther diſeovery.</p>
                <p>In this manner did the tyrant continue to torment others, although hc was
                    himſelf ſtill more tortured by h is own ſuſpicions ; ſo that in one of his
                    letters to the ſenate, he conſeſſed that the gods and goddeſſe3 had ſo afflicted
                    and confounded him, that he knew not what or how to write. In the mean time, the
                    frontier provinces were invaded with impunity by the barbarians. Mæfia was
                    ſeized on by the Dacians and Sar-matians ; Gaul was waſted by the Germans, and
                    Armenia conquered by the king of Parthia. Tiberius, however, was ſo much a Have
                    to his brutal appetites, that he left his provinces wholly to the care of his
                    lieutenants, and they were intent rather on the accumulation of private fortune
                    than the ſafety of the ſtate. Such a total diſorder in the empire produced ſuch
                    a degree of anxiety in him who governed it, that he was heard to wiſh, that
                    heaven and earth might periſh when he died. At length, however, in the 22d year
                    of his reign, he began to feel the approaches of his diſſolution, and all his
                    appetites totally to forſake him. He now, therefore, found it was time to think
                    of a ſucceſſor, and heſitated for a long while, whether he ſhould chooſe
                    Caligula, whoſe vices were too apparent to eſcape his obſervation. He had been
                    often heard to ſay, that this youth had all the faults of Sylla, without his
                    virtues ; that he w <hi rend="sup">τ</hi> as a ſerpent that would ſting the
                    empire, and a Phaeton that would ſet the world in a flame. However,
                    notwithſtanding all his w’ell-grounded apprehenſions, he named him for his
                    ſucceſſor ; willing, perhaps, by the enormity of Caligula’s conduct to cover the
                    memory of his own.</p>
                <p>But though he thought fit to chooſe a ſucceſſor, he concealed his approaching
                    decline with the utmoſt care, as if he was willing at once to hide it from the
                    world and himſelf. He long had a contempt for phyfic, and refuſed the advice of
                    ſuch as attended him : he even ſeemed to take a pleaſure in being preſent at the
                    ſports of the ſoldiers, and ventured himſelf to throw a javelin at a boar that
                    was let looſe before him. The effort which he made upon this occaſion cauſed a
                    pain in his ſide, which haſtened the approaches of death : ſtill, however, he
                    ſeemed willing to avoid his end ; and ſtrove, by change of place, to put off the
                    inquietude of his ow <hi rend="sup">,</hi> n reflections. He left his
                    favourite iſland, and went upon the continent, where he at laſt fixed at the
                    promontory of Miſenum. It was here that Charicles, his phyſician, pretending to
                    kiſs his hand, felt the failure of his pulſe ; and appriſed Macro, the emperor’s
                    preſent favourite, that he had not above two days to live. Tiberius, on the
                    contrary, who had perceived the art of Charicles, did all in his power to
                    impreis his attendants with an opinion of his health : he continued at table
                    till the evening ; he ſaluted all his gueſts as they left the room, and read the
                    acts of the ſenate, in which they had abſolved ſome perſons he had written
                    againſt, with great indignation. He</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0403" facs="gri_33125011196389_0409.tif"/>
                <p>reſolved to take ſignal vengeance of their diſobedience, and meditated new
                    ſchemes of cruelty, when he ſell into ſuch faintings, as all believed were
                    fatal. It was in this ſituation, that, by Macro’s advice, Caligula prepared to
                    ſecure the ſucceſſion. He received the congratulations of the whole court,
                    cauſed himſelf to be acknowledged by the Praetorian ſoldiers, and went forth
                    from the emperor’s apartment amidſt the applauſes of the multitude ; when all of
                    a ſudden hc was informed that the emperor was recovered, that he had besann to
                    ſpeak, and deſired to eat. This unexpected account filled the whole court with
                    terror and alarm : every one who had before been earneft in teſtifying their
                    jov, now re-ailumed their pretended ſorrow, and left the new emperor, through a
                    feigned ſolicitude ſor the ſate of the old. Caligula himſelf ſeemed
                    thunder-ſtruck ; he preſerved a gloomy ſilence, expecting nothing but death,
                    inſtead of the empire at which he had aſpired. Macro, however, who was hardened
                    in crimes, ordered that the dying emperor ſhould be diſpatched, by ſmothering
                    him with pillows, or, as others will have it, by poiſon. In this manner Tiberius
                    died, in the 78th year of his age, after reigning 22.</p>
                <p>The Romans were, at this time, arrived at their higheſt pitch of effeminacy and
                    vice. The wealth of almoſt every nation of the empire, having, for ſome time,
                    circulated through the city, brought with it the luxuries peculiar to each
                    country ; ſo that Rome preſented a deteſtable picture of various pollution. In
                    this reign lived Aρicius, ſo well khow <hi rend="sup">,</hi> n for having
                    reduced gluttony into a ſyſtem ; ſome of the moſt notorious in this way, thought
                    it no ſhame to give near ιco pounds for a ſingle fiſh, and exhauſt a fortune of
                    50,000 pounds in one entertainment. Debaucheries of every other kind kept pace
                    with this ; while the deteſtable folly of the times thought it was refining upon
                    pleaſure to make it unnatural. There were at Rome men called <hi rend="italic">ſpintriæ, w</hi> hoſe ſole trade it was to ſtudy new modes of pleaſure ;
                    and theſe were univerſally favourites of the great. The ſenators were long
                    fallen from their authority, and were no leſs eſtranged from their integrity and
                    honour. Their whole ſtudy ſeemed to be, how to invent new ways of flattering the
                    emperor, and various methods of tormenting his ſuppoſed enemies. The people were
                    ſtill more corrupt : they had, for ſome years, been accuſtomed to live in
                    idleneſs, upon the donations of the emperor ; and, being ſatisfied with
                    ſeibſiſtence, entirely gave up their freedom. Too effeminate and cowardly to go
                    to war, they only railed againſt their governors ; ſo that they were bad
                    ſoldiers and ſeditious citizens. In the 18th year of this monarch’s reign,
                    ∙Chrift was crucified. Shortly after his death, Pilate is ſaid to have written
                    to Tiberius an account of his paſſion, reſurrection, and miracles ; upon which
                    the emperor made a report of the whole to the ſenate, deſiring that Chriſt might
                    be accounted a god by the Romans. But the ſenate being diſpleaſed that the
                    propoſal had not come firſt from themſelves, reſuſed to allow of his apotheoſiS
                    ; alleging an ancient law, which gave them the ſuperintendance in all matters of
                    religion. They even went ſo far, as by an edict to command that all Chriſtians
                    ſhould leave the city : but Tiberius, by another edict, threatened death to all
                    ſuch as ſhould accuſe them ; by which means they continued unmoleſted during the
                    reſt of his reign.</p>
                <p>No monarch ever came to the throne with more advantages than Caligula. He was
                    the ſon of Germanicus, who had been the darling of the army and the people. He
                    was bred among the ſoldiers, from whom he received the name of <hi rend="italic"
                        > Caligula,</hi> from the ſhort buſ-kin, called <hi rend="italic">cαligα,</hi> that was worn by the common centinels, and which was alſo uſually worn by
                    him. As hc approached Romç, the principal men of the ſtate went out in crowds to
                    meet him. He received the congratulations of the people on every ſide, all
                    equally pleaſed in being fee from the cruelties of Tiberius, and in hoping new
                    advantages from the virtues of his ſucceffor.</p>
                <p>Caligula ſeemed to take every precaution to impreſs them with the opinion of an
                    happy change. Amidſt the rejoicings of the multitude, he advanced mourning, with
                    the dead body of Tiberius, which the ſoldiers brought to be burnt at Rome,
                    according to the cuſtom of that time. Upon his entrance into the city, he was
                    received with new titles of honour by the ſenate, whoſe chief employτnent ſeemed
                    now to be, the art of increaſing their emperor’s vanity. He was left co-heir
                    with Gemellus, grandſon to Tiberius ; but they ſet aſide the nomination, and
                    declared Caligula ſole ſucceffor to the empire. The joy for this election was
                    not confined to the narrow bounds of Italy ; it ſpread through the whole empire,
                    and victims without number were ſacrificed upon the occaſion. Some of the
                    people, Upon his going into the iſland of Campania, made vows for his return;
                    and ſhortly after, when he fell ſick, the multitudes crowded whole nights round
                    his palace, and ſome even devoted themſelves to death in caſe he recovered,
                    ſetting up bills of their reſolutions in the ſtreets. In this affection of the
                    citizens, ſtrangers themſelves ſeemed ambitious of ſharing. Artabanus, king of
                    Parthia, ſought the emperor’s alliance with aſſiduity. He came to a perſonal
                    conference with one of his legates ; paſſed the Euphrates, adored the Roman
                    eagles, and kiſſed the emperor’s images ; ſo that the whole wOrld ſeemed
                    combined to praiſe him for virtues which they ſuppoſed him to poſſeſs.</p>
                <p>I hc new emperor at firſt ſeemed extremely careful of the public favour ; and
                    having performed the funeral ſolemnities of Tiberius, he haſtened to the iſlands
                    of Pandataria and Pontia, to remove the aſhes of his mother and brothers,
                    expofing himſelf to the dangers of tempeſtuous weather, to give a luſtre to his
                    piety. Having brought them to Rome, he inſtituted annual ſolemnities in their
                    honour, and ordered the month of September to be called <hi rend="italic">Germαηi</hi> ∣ <hi rend="italic">us,</hi> in memory of his father. Theſe
                    ceremonies being over, he conferred the ſame honours upon his grandmother
                    Antonia, which had before been given to Livia ; and ordered all informations to
                    be burnt', that any ways expoſed the enemies of his family. He even refuſed a
                    paper that was offered him, tending to the diſcovery of a conſpiracy againſt
                    him; alleging, That he was conſeious of nothſhg to defetve any man’s hatred, and
                    therefore had no fears from their machinations. He cauſed the inſtitutions of
                    Auguſtus, which had been diſetſed in the reign of Tiberius, to be revived ;
                    undertook to reform many abuſes in the ſtate, and ſeverely puniſhed corrupt
                    governors. Among others, he baniſhed Pontius Pilate into Gaul, where firs unjuſt
                    magiſtrate afterwards put an· end to his Uſe by ſuicide. He baniſhed the

                <p>or inventors of abominable recreations, from Rome ; attempted to reſtore the
                    ancient manner of electing magiſtrates by the ſuffrages of the people ; and gave
                    them a free juriſdiction, without any appeal to himſelf. Although the will of
                    Tiberius was annulled by the ſenate, and that of Livia ſuppreſſed by Tiberius,
                    yet he cauſed all their legacies to be punctually paid; and in order to make
                    Gemellus amends for miffing the crown, he cauſed him to be elected Princeps
                    Juventutis, or principal of the youth. He reſtored ſome kings to their dominions
                    who had been unjuſtly uilpoſſefſed by Tiberius, and gave them the arrears of
                    their revenues. And, that he might appear an encourager of every virtue, he
                    ordered a female ſlave a large ſum of money for enduring the moſt exquiſite
                    torments without diſcovering the ſecrets of her maſter. So many conceſſions, and

                    ſinging in praiſe of the emperor’s virtues. It was likewiſe ordained, that the
                    day on which he was appointed to the empire ſhould be called <hi rend="italic">Publia ;</hi> implying, that when he came to govern, the city received a
                    new foundation.</p>
                <p>In leſs than eight months all this ſhew of moderation and clemency vaniſhed ;
                    while furious paſſions, un-exampled avarice, and capricious cruelty, began to
                    take their turn in his mind. As moſt of the cruelties of Tiberius aroſe from
                    ſuſpicion, ſo moſt of thoſe committed by Caligula took riſe from prodigality.
                    Some indeed aſſert, that a diſorder which happened ſoon after his acceſſion to
                    the empire, entirely diſcompoſed his underſtanding. However this may be, madneſs
                    itſelf could ſcarce dictate cruelties more extravagant, or in-conſiſtencies more
                    ridiculous, than are imputed to him ; ſome of them appear almoſt beyond belief,
                    as they ſeem entirely without any motive to incite ſuch barbarities.</p>
                <p>The firſt object of his cruelty was a perſon named <hi rend="italic">Ρυlitus,</hi> who had devoted himſelf to death, in caſe the emperor, who was then ſick,
                    ſhould recover. When Caligula’s health was re-eſtabliſhed, he was informed of
                    the zeal of Politus, and/ actually compelled him to complete his vow. This
                    ridiculous devotee was therefore led round the city, by children, adorned with
                    chaplets, and then put to death, being thrown headlong from the ramparts.
                    Another, named <hi rend="italic">Secundus <hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi> had vowed to fight in the amphitheatre upon the ſame occaſion. To this he
                    was alſo compelled, the emperor himſelf chooſing to be a ſpectator of the
                    combat. However, he was more fortunate than the former, being ſo ſucceſsful as
                    to kill his adverſary, by which he obtained a releaſe from his vow. Gemellus was
                    the next who ſuffered from the tyrant’s inhumanity. The pretence againſſ him
                    was, that he had wiſhed the emperor might not recover, and that he had taken a
                    counter-poiſon to ſecure him from any ſecret attempts againſt his life. Caligula
                    ordered him to kill himſelf; but as the unfortunate youth was ignorant of the
                    manner of doing it, the emperor’s meſſengers ſoon inſtructed him in the fatal
                    leſſon. Silenus, the emperor’s father-in-law, was the next that was put to death
                    upon flight ſuſpicions·; and Gercinus, a ſenator of noted integrity, refuſing to
                    witneſs falſely againſt him, ſhared his fate. After theſe followed a crowd of
                    victims to the emperor’s avarice or ſuſpicion. The pretext againſt them was
                    their enmity to his family ; and in proof of his accuſations he produced thoſe
                    very memorials which but a while before he pretended to have burnt. Among the
                    number of thoſe who were ſacriſiced to his jealouſy, was Macro, the late
                    favourite of Tiberius, and the perſon to whom Caligula owed his empire. He was
                    accuſed of many crimes, ſome of which were common to the emperor as well as to
                    him, and his death brought on the ruin of his whole family.</p>
                <p>Theſe cruelties, however, only ſeemed the firſt fruits of a mind naturally timid
                    and ſul'picious: his vanity and profuſion ſoon gave riſe to others which were
                    more atrocious, as they ſprung from leſs powerful motives. His pride firſt began
                    by aſſuming to himſelf the title of <hi rend="italic">ruler,</hi> which was
                    uſually granted only to kings. He would alſo have taken the crown and diadem,
                    had he not been adviſed that he was already ſuperior to all the monarchs of the
                    world. Not long afttr, he aſſumed divine honours, and gave himſelf the names of
                    ſuch divinities as he thought moſt agreeable to his nature. For this purpoſe he
                    cauſed the heads of the ſtatues of Jupiter and ſome other gods to be ſtruck off,
                    and his own to be put in their places. He frequently ſeated himſelf between
                    Caſtor and Pollux, and ordered all who came to their temple to worſhip, ſhould
                    pay their adorations only to him ; nay, at laſt he altered their temple to the
                    form of a portico, which he joined to his palace, that the very gods, as he
                    ſaid, might ſerve him in the quality of porters.</p>
                <p>He was not leſs notorious for the depravation of hi» appetites than for his
                    ridiculous preſumptions. Neither perſon, place, nor ſex, were obſtacles to the
                    indulgence of his unnatural lulls. There was ſcarce a lady of any quality in
                    Rome that eſeaped his lewdneſs;. and, indeed, ſuch was the degeneracy of the
                    times, that there were few ladies who did not think this diſgrace an honour. He
                    committed inceſt with his three fitters, and at public feaſts they lay with
                    their heads upon his boſom by turns. Of theſe he proſtituted Livia and
                    A-grippina to his vile companions, and then baniſhed them as adnltereſſes and
                    conſpirators againſt his perſen. As for Druſilla, he took her from her huſhand
                    Longinus, and kept her as his wife. Her he loved ſo affectionately, that, being
                    ſick, he appointed her as heireſs of his empire and fortune ; and ſhe happening
                    to die before him, he made her a goddeſs. Nor did her example when living,
                    appear more dangerous to the people than her divinity when dead. To mourn for
                    her death was a crime, as ſhe was become a goddeſs ; and to rejoice for her
                    divinity was capital, becauſe ſhe was dead. Nay, even ſilence itſelf was an
                    unpardonable inſenſibili-ty, either of the emperor’s loſs or his fitter’s
                    advancement. Thus he made his ſiſter ſubſervient to his profit, as before he had
                    done to his pleaſure ; raiſing vaſt ſums of money by granting pardons to ſome,
                    and by conſiſeating the goods of others. As to his marriages, whether he
                    contracted them with greater levity, or diſſolved them with greater injuſtice,
                    is not eaſy to determine. Being preſent at the nuptials of Livia Oreſtilla with
                    Piſo, as ſoon as the ſolemnity was over, he commanded her to be brought to him
                    as his own wiſe, and then diſmiſſed her in a few days. He ſoon after baniſhed
                    her upon ſuſpicion of cohabiting with her huſ-band after ſhe was parted ſrom
                    him. He was enamoured of Lollia Paulina, upon a bare relation of her grand?</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0405" facs="gri_33125011196389_0411.tif"/>
                <p>mother’s beauty ; and thereupon took her ſrom her huſ-band, who. commanded in
                    Macedonia : notwithſtanding which, he repudiated her as he had done the former,
                    and likewiſe forbad her future marrying with any other. The wife who caught moſt
                    firmly upon his affections was Milonia Cæfonia, whoſe chief merit lay in her
                    perfect acquaintance with all the alluring arts of her ſex, for ſhe was
                    otherwiſe poſſeſſed neither of youth nor beauty. She continued with him during
                    his reign ; and he loved her ſo ridiculouſly, that he ſometimes ſhowed her to
                    his ſoldiers dreſſed in armour, and ſometimes to his companions ſtark naked.</p>
                <p>But of all his vices, his prodigality was the moſt remarkable, and that which in
                    ſome meaſure gave riſe to the reſt. The luxuries of former emperors were
                    ſimplicity itſelf, when compared to thoſe which he practiſed. He contrived new
                    ways of bathing, where the richeſt oils and moſt precious perfumes were
                    exhauſted with the utmoſt profuſion. He found out diſhes of immenſe value; and
                    had even jewels, as we are told, diſſolved among his ſauces. He ſometimes had
                    ſervices of pure gold preſented before his gueſts inſtead of meat ; obſerving,
                    that a man ſhould be an ceconomiſt or an emperor.</p>
                <p>For ſeveral days together he flung conſiderable ſums of money among the people.
                    He ordered ſhips of a prodigious bulk to be built of cedar, the Items of ivory
                    inlaid with gold and jewels, the fails and tackling of various ſilks, while the
                    decks were planted with the choiceſt fruit tιees, under the ſhade of which he
                    often dined. Here, attended by all the miniſters of his pleaſures, the moſt
                    exquiſite fingers, and the moſt beautiful youths, he coaſted along the ſhore of
                    Campania with great ſplendor. All his buildings ſeemed rather calculated to
                    raiſe aſtoniſhment, than to anſwer the purpoſes of utility. But the moſt
                    notorious inſtance of his fruitleſs profuſion was the vaſt bridge at Puteoli,
                    which he undertook in the third year of his reigu. To ſatisfy his deſire of
                    being maſter as well of the ocean as the land, he cauſed an infinite number of
                    ſhips to be faſtened to each other, ſo as to make a floating bridge from Baiæ to
                    Puteoli, acroſs an arm of the ſea three miles and an half broad. The ſhips being
                    placed in two rows, in form of a creſeent, were ſecured to each other with
                    anchors, chains, and cables. Over theſe were laid vaſt quantities of timber, and
                    upon that earth, ſo as to make the whole reſemble one of the ſtreets of Rome. He
                    next cauſed ſeveral houſes to be built upon his new bridge, for the reception of
                    himſelf and his attendants, into which freſh water was conveyed by pipes from
                    land. He then repaired thither with all his court, attended by prodigious
                    throngs of people, who came from all parts to be ſpectators of ſuch an expenſive
                    pageant. It was there that Caligula, adorned with all the magnificence of
                    eaſtern royalty, ſitting on horſeback with a civic crown and Alexander’s
                    breaſt-plate, attended by the great officers of the army, and all the nobility
                    of Rome, entered at one end of the bridge, and with ridiculous importance rode
                    to the other. At night, the number of torches and other illuminations with which
                    this expenſive ſtructure was adorned, caſt ſuch a gleam as illuminated the whole
                    bay, and all the neighbouring mountains. This - ſeemed to give the weak emperor
                    new cauſe for exultation ; boaſting that he had turned night into day, as well
                    as ſea into land.</p>
                <p>The next morning he again rode over in a triumphant chariot, followed by a
                    numerous train of charioteers, and all his ſoldiers in glittering armour. He
                    then aſcended a roſtrum erected for the occaſion, where he made a ſolemn oration
                    in praiſe of the greatneſs of his enterpriſe, and the aſſiduity of his w <hi
                        rend="sup"> ,</hi> orkmen and his army. He then diſtributed rewards among
                    his men, and a ſplendid feaſt ſucceeded. In the midſt of the entertainment many
                    of his attendants were thrown into the ſea ; ſeveral ſhips filled with
                    ſpectators were attacked and ſunk in an hoſtile manner ; and although the
                    majority eſeaped through the calmneſs of the weather, yet many were drowned ;
                    and ſome who endeavoured to ſave themſelves by climbing to the bridge, were
                    ſtruck down again by the emperor’s command. The calmneſs of the ſea during this
                    pageant, which continued ſor two days, furniſhed Caligula with freſh
                    opportunities for boaſting ; being heard to ſay, “ that Neptune took care to
                    keep the ſea ſmooth and ſerene, merely out of reverence to him.”</p>
                <p>Expences like theſe, it may be naturally ſuppoſed, muſt have exhauſted the moſt
                    unbounded wealth : in fact, after reigning about a year, Caligula found his
                    revenues totally exhauſted ; and a fortune of about x 8,ooo,ooo of our money,
                    which Tiberius had amaſſed together, entirely ſpent in extravagance and folly.
                    Now, therefore, his prodigality put him upon new methods of ſupplying the
                    exchequer ; and as before his profuſion, ſo now his rapacity became boundleſs.
                    He put in practice all kinds of rapine and extortion ; while his principal ſtudy
                    ſeemed to be the inventing new im-poſts and illicit confiſcations. Every thing
                    was taxed, to the very wages of the meaneſt tradesman. He cauſed freemen to
                    purchaſe their freedom a ſecond time ; and poiſoned many who had named him for
                    their heir, to have the immediate poſſeſſion of their fortunes. He ſet up a
                    brothel in his own palace, by which he gained conſiderable ſums by all the
                    methods of proſtitution. He alſo kept a gaming-houſe, in which he himſelf
                    preſided, lcrupling none of the meaneſt tricks in order to advance his gains. On
                    a certain occaſion having had a run of ill luck, he faw two rich knights paſſing
                    through his court; upon which he ſuddenly roſe up, and cauſing both to be
                    apprehended, conſiſcated their eſtates, and then joining his former companions,
                    boaſted that he never had a better throw in his life. Another time, wanting
                    money for a ſtake, he went down and cauſed ſeveral noblemen to be put to death ;
                    and then returning, told the company that they ſat playing for trifles while he
                    had won 60,000 ſeſterces at a caſt.</p>
                <p>Suςh inſupportable and capricious cruelties produced many ſecret conſpiracies
                    againſt him ; but theſe were ſor a while deferred, upon account of his intended
                    expedition againſt the Germans and Britons, which he undertook in the third year
                    of his reign. For this purpoſe, he cauſed numerous levies to be made in all
                    parts of the empire ; and talked with ſo much reſolution, that it was
                    univerſally believed he would conquer all before him. His march perfectly
                    indicated the inequality of his temper : ſometimes it was ſo rapid, that the
                    cohorts were obliged to leave their ſtandards behind them ; at other times it
                    was ſo flow, that it more reſembled a pompous proceſſion than a military expe»
                    dition. In this diſpoſition he would cauſe himſelſ to be carried on eight mens
                    ſhoulders, and order all the</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0406" facs="gri_33125011196389_0412.tif"/>
                <p>neighbouring cities to have their ſtreets well ſwept and watered to defend him
                    from the dull. However, all theſe mighty preparations ended in nothing. Inſtead
                    of conquering Britain, he only gave refuge to one of its baniſhed prinςes ; and
                    this he deſcribed in a letter to the ſenate, a∙3 taking poſſeſſion of the whole
                    iſland. Inſtead of conquering Germany, he only led his army to the ſea ſhore in
                    Batavia. There· diſpoſing his engines and warlike machines with great ſolemnity,
                    and drawing up his men in order of battle,, he went on <hi rend="sup">ι</hi> board his galley, with which coaſting along, he commanded his trumpets to ſound
                    and the ſignal to be given as if for an engagement ; upon which, his men having
                    had previous orders, immediately fell to gathering the ſhells that lay upon the
                    ſhore into their helmets, terming them the <hi rend="italic">ſpoils of the
                        conquered ocean worthy of the palace and the capitol.</hi> After this
                    doughty expedition, calling his army together as a general after victory, he -
                    harangued them in a pompous manner, and highly extolled their atchievements ;
                    and then diſtributing money among them, diſmiſſed them with orders to be joyful,
                    and congratulated them upon their riches. But that ſuch exploits ſhould not paſs
                    without a memorial, he cauſed a loſty tower to be erected by the ſea-ſide ; and
                    ordered the galleys in which he had put to ſea to be conveyed to Rome in a great
                    meaſure by land.</p>
                <p>After numberleſs inſtances of ſolly and cruelty in this expedition, among which
                    he had intentions of deſtroying the whole army that had formerly mutinied under
                    his father Germanicus, he began to think of a triumph. The ſenate, who had long
                    been the timid miniſters of his pride and cruelty, immediately ſet about
                    conſulting how to ſatisfy his expectations. They conſidered that a triumph
                    would, even to himſelſ, appear as a burleſque upon his expedition : they
                    therefore decreed him only an ovation. Having come to this reſolution, they ſent
                    him a deputation, informing him of the honours granted him, and the decree,
                    which was drawn up in terms of the moſt extravagant adulation. However, their
                    flattery was far from ſatisfying his pride. He conſidered their conduct rather
                    as a diminution of his power, than an addition to his glory. He therefore
                    ordered them, on pain of death, not to concern themſelves with his honours; and
                    being met by their meſſengers on the way, who invited him to come and partake of
                    the preparations which the ſenate had decreed, he informed them that he would
                    came ; and then laying his hand upon his ſword, added, that he would bring that
                    alſo with him. In this m inner, either quite omitting his triumph, or deferring
                    it to another time, he entered the city with only an ovation ; while the ſenate
                    paſſed the whole day in acclamations in his praiſe, and ſpeeches filled with the
                    moſt exceſſive flattery. This conduct in ſome meaſure ſerved to reconcile him,
                    and ſoon after their exceſſive zeal in his cauſe entirely gained his favour. For
                    it happened that Protogenes, who was one of the moſt intimate and the moſt cruel
                    of his favourites, coming into the houſe, was fawned upon by the whole body of
                    the ſenate, and particularly by Proculus. Whereupon Protogenes with a fierce
                    look, alked how one who was ſuch an enemy to the emperor could be ſuch a friend
                    to him ? There needed no more to excite the ſenate againſt Proculus. They
                    inſtantly ſeized upon him, and violently tore him</p>
                <p>in pieces ; plainly ſhowitg by their conduct, that tyranny in a prince produces
                    cruelty in thoſe whom lie governs.—It was after returning from this extravagant
                    expedition, that he was waited upon by a deputation of the Jews of Alexandria,
                    who came to deprecate his anger ſor not worſhipping his divinity as other
                    nations had done. The emperor gave them a very ungracious reception, and would
                    probably have deſtroyed their countrymen if he had not ſoon alter been cut off.</p>
                <p>This affair of the ∖Jews remained undecided during h’s reign ; but it was at
                    laſt ſettled by his ſucceſſor to their ſatisfaction. It was upon this occaſion
                    that Philo made the following remarkable anſwer to his aſſociates, who w <hi
                        rend="sup"> ,</hi> ere terrified with apprehenſions of the emperor’s
                    indignation ; “ Fear nothing (cried he to them), Caligula, by declaring againſt
                    us, puts God on our ſide.”</p>
                <p>The continuation of this horrid reign ſeemed to threaten univerſal calamity :
                    however, it was but ſhort. There had already been ſeveral conſpiracies formed to
                    deſtroy the tyrant, but without ſucceſs. That which at laſt ſucceeded in
                    delivering the world of this monſter, was concerted under the influence of
                    Caſſius Che-rea, tribune of the prætorian bands. This was a man of experienced
                    courage, an ardent admirer of freedom, and conſequently an enemy to tyrants.
                    Beſides the motives which he had in common with other men, he had received
                    repeated inſults from Caligula, who took all occaſions of turning him into
                    ridicule, and impeaching him of cowardice, merely becauſe he had an effeminate
                    voice. Whenever Cherea came to demand the watch-word from the emperor, according
                    to cuſtom, he always gave him either Venus, Adonis, or ſome ſuch, implying
                    effeminacy and ſoftneſs. He therefore ſecretly imparted his deſigns to ſeveral
                    ſenators and knights whom he knew to have received perſonal injuries from
                    Caligula, or to be apprehenſive of thoſe to come. Among theſe was Valerius
                    Aſiaticus, whoſe wife the emperor had debauched. Annius Vincianus, who was
                    ſuſpected of having been in a former conſpiracy, was now deſirous of really
                    engaging in the firſt deſign that offered Beſides theſe, were Clemens the
                    preſect ; and Caliſtus, whoſe riches made him obnoxious to the: tyrant’s
                    reſentment.</p>
                <p>While theſe were deliberating upon the moſt certain and ſpeedy method of
                    deſtroying the tyrant, an unexpected incident gave new’ ſtrength to the
                    conſpiracy. Pompedius, a ſenator of diſtinction, having been accuſed before the
                    errφeror, of having ſpoken of him with diſreſpect, the informer cited one
                    Quintilia, an actreſs, to con ,rm his accuſation. Quintilia, however, was
                    poſſeſſed of a degree of fortitude not eaſily found. She denied the fact with
                    obſtinacy ; and being put to the torture at the informer’s requeſt, ſhe bore the
                    ſevereſt torments of the rack with unſhaken conſtancy. But what is moſt
                    remarkable of her reſolution is, that ſhe was acquainted with all the
                    particulars of the conſpiracy ; and although Cherea was appointed to preſide at
                    her torture ſhe revealed nothing : on the contrary, when ſhe was led to the
                    rack, ſhe trod upon the toe of one of the conſpirators, intimating at once her
                    knowledge of the confederacy, and her own reſolution not to divulge it. In this
                    manner ſhe ſuffered until all her limbs were diſlocated ; and in that deplorable
                    ſtate was preſented to the emperor, who ordered her a gratuity for what ſhe had
                    ſuffered. Cherea could now no Ion-</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0407" facs="gri_33125011196389_0413.tif"/>
                <p>ger contain his indignation at being thus made the inſtrument of a tyrant’s
                    cruelty. He therefore propoſed to the conſpirators to attack him as he went to
                    offer ſacrifices in the Capitol, or while he was employed in the ſecret
                    pleaſures of the palace. The reſt, however, were of opinion, that it was beſt to
                    fall upon him when he ſhould be unattended ; by which means they would be more
                    certain of ſucceſs. After ſeveral deliberations, it was at laſt reſolved to
                    attack him during the continuance of the Palatine games, which laſted ſour days;
                    and to ſtrike the blow when his guards ſhould have the leaſt opportunity to
                    defend hi u. In conſequence of this, the three firſt days of the games paſted
                    without affording that opportunity which was ſo ardently deſired. Cherea now,
                    therefore, began to apprehend, that deferring the time of the conſpiracy might
                    be a mean to divulge it : he even began to dread, that the honour of killing the
                    tyrant might fall to the lot of ſome other perſon more bold than himſelf.
                    Wherefore, he at laſt reſolved to defer the execution of his plot only to the
                    day following, when Caligula ſhould paſs through a private gallery, to ſome
                    baths not far diſtant from the palace.</p>
                <p>The laſt day of the games was more ſplendid than the reſt ; and Caligula ſeemed
                    more ſprightly and con-deſcending than uſhal. He took great amuſement in ſeeing
                    the people ſeramble for the fruits and other rarities thrown by his order among
                    them ; and ſeemed no way apprehenſive of the plot for r,ed ſor his deſtruction.
                    In the mean time, thé conſpiracy began to tran-ſpire; and had he poſſeſſed any
                    friends, it could not have failed of being diſcovered. The conſpirators waited a
                    great part of the day with the moſt extreme anxiety ; and at one time Caligula
                    ſeemed reſolved to ſpend the whole day without any refreſhment. This unexpected
                    delay entirely exaſperated Cherea; and had he not been reſtrained, he would have
                    gone and perpetrated his deſign in the midſt of all the people. Juſt at that
                    inſtant, while he was yet hefιtating what he ſhould do, Aſprenas, one of the
                    conſpirators, perfuadcd Caligula to go to the bath and take ſome flight
                    refreſhment, in order to enjoy the reſt of the entertainment with greater
                    reliſh. The emperor therefore riling up, the conſpirators uſed every precaution
                    to keep off the throng, and to ſurround him, under pretence of greater
                    affι-duity. Upon entering into the little vaulted gallery that led to the bath,
                    he was met by a band of Grecian children who had been inſtructed in ſinging, and
                    were come to perform in his preſence. He was once more therefore going to return
                    into the theatre with them, had not the leader of the band excuſed himſelf, as
                    having a cold» This was the moment that Cherea ſeized to ſtrike him to the
                    ground ; crying out, “ Tyrant, think upon this.” Immediately after, the other
                    conſpirators ruſhed in; and while the- emperctr continued to refiſt, crying out,
                    that he was not yet dead, they diſpatched hi u with 30 wounds, in the 29th year
                    of his age, after a ſhort reign of three years ten months and eight, days. With
                    him, his wiſe and infant daughter alſo periſhed , the one being ſtabbed by a
                    centurion, the other having its brains daſhed out againſt the walk His coin was
                    alſo melted down by a decree of the ſenate ; and ſuch precautions were taken,
                    that all ſeemed willing, that neither his features nor his name might be
                    tranſmitted to poſterity.</p>
                <p>As ſoon as the death Caligula was made public, it produced the greateſt
                    confuſion in all parts of the city. The conſpirators, who only aimed at
                    deſtroying a tyrant without attending to a ſucceffor, had all ſought ſafety by
                    retiring to private places. Some thought the report of the emperor’s death was
                    only an artifice of his own, to ſee how his enemies would behave. Others averred
                    that he was ſtill alive, and actually in a fair way to recover. In this interval
                    of ſuſpenſe, the German guards finding it a convenient time to pillage, gave a
                    looſe to their licentiouſneſs, under a pretence of revenging the emperor’s
                    death. All the conſpiratora and ſenators that ſell in their way received no
                    mercy ; Aſprenas, Norbanus, and Anteius, were cut in pieces. However, they grew
                    calm hy degrees, and the ſenate was permitted to aſſemble, in order to
                    deliberate upon what w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> as neceſſary to be done in the
                    preſent emergency.</p>
                <p>In this deliberation, Saturninus, who was then con-ſtil, inſiſted much upon the
                    benefits of liberty ; and talked in raptures of Cherea’s fortitude, alleging
                    that it deſerved the higheſt reward. This was a language highly pleaſing to the
                    ſenate. Liberty now became the favourite topic ; and they even ventured to talk
                    of extinguiſhing the very name of Cæſar. Impreſſed with this reſolution, they
                    brought over ſome cohorts of the city to their ſide, and boldly ſeized upon the
                    Capitol. But it was now too late for Rome to regain her priſtine freedom ; the
                    populace and the army oppoſing their endeavours. The former were ſtill mindful
                    of their ancient hatred to the ſenate ; and remembered the donations and public
                    ſpectacles of the emperors with regret. <hi rend="sup">r</hi> Γhe latter were
                    ſenſible they could have no power but in a monarchy ; and had ſome hopes that
                    the election of the emperor would fall to their determination. In this
                    oppoſition of intereſts, and variety of opinions, chance ſeemed at laſt to
                    decide the fate of the empire. Some ſoldiers happening to run about the palace,
                    diſcovered Claudius, Caligula’s uncle, lurking in a ſecret place, where he had
                    hid himſelf through ſear. Of this perſonage, who had hitherto been deſpiſed for
                    his imbecillity, they reſolved to make an emperor : and accordingly carried him
                    upon their ſhoulders to the camp, where they proclaimed him at a time he
                    expected nothing but death.</p>
                <p>The ſenate now, therefore, perceiving that force alone was likely to ſettle the
                    ſucceiſion, were reſolved to fubmit, ſince they had no power to oppoſe. Claudius
                    was the perſon moſt nearly allied to the late emperor, then living ; being the
                    nephew of Tiberius, and the uncle of Caligula. The ſenate therefore paſſed a
                    decree, confirming him in the empire ; and went ſoon after in a body, to render
                    him their compullive homage. Cherea vyas the firſt who fell a ſacriſice to the
                    jealoufy of this new monarch. He met death with all the fortitude of an ancient
                    Roman ; deſiring to die by the ſame ſword with which* he had killed Caligula.
                    Lupus, his friend, was put to death with him ; and Sa-binus, one. of the
                    conſpirators, laid violent hands on himſelf.</p>
                <p>Claudius was 50 years old when he began to reign. The complicated diſeaſes of
                    his infancy had in ſome teeaſure affected all the faculties both of his body and
                    mind. He was continued in a ſtate of pupillage much longer than w <hi rend="sup"
                        > τ</hi> as uſual at that time; and ſeemed, in</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0408" facs="gri_33125011196389_0414.tif"/>
                <p>every part of his life incapable of conducting himſelf. Not that he was entirely
                    deſtitute of underſtanding, ſince he had made a tolerable proficiency in the
                    Greek and Latin languages, and even wrote an hiſtory of his own time ; which,
                    however deſtitute of other merit, was not contemptible in point of ſtyle.
                    Nevertheleſs, with this ſhare of erudition, he was unable to advance himſelf in
                    the ſtate, and ſeemed utterly neglected until he was placed all at once at the
                    head of affairs. The commencement of his reign gave the moſt promiſing hopes oi
                    an happy continuance. He began by paſſing an act of oblivion for all former
                    words and actions, and diſannulled all the cruel edicts of Caligula. He forbade
                    all perſons, upon ſevere penalties, to ſacriſice to him as they had done to
                    Caligula ; was arduous in hearing and examining complaints ; and frequently
                    adminiſtered juſtice in perſon ; tempering by his mildneſs the ſeverity of the
                    law. We are told of his bringing a woman to acknowledge her ſon, by ad judging
                    her to marry him. The tribunes of the people coming one day to attend hh when he
                    was on his tribunal. he courteouſly excuſed himſelſ for not having room for them
                    to fit down. By this deportment he ſo much gained the affections of the people,
                    that upon a vague report of his being ſlain by ſurpriſe, they ran about the
                    ſtreets in the utmoſt rage and conſternation, with horrid imprecations againſt
                    all ſuch as were ac-ceſſary to his death ; nor could they be appeaſed, until
                    they were aſſured, with certainty, of his ſafety. He •took a more than ordinary
                    care that Ro"me ſhould be continually ſupplied with corn and proviſions,
                    ſecuring the merchants againſt pirates. He was not leſs affi-duous in his
                    buildings, in which he excelled almoſt all that went before him. He conſtructed
                    a wonderful aquæduct, called after his own name, much ſurpafling any other in
                    Rome, either for w <hi rend="sup">r</hi> orkroanffιip or plentiful ſupply.
                    It-brought water from 40 miles diſtance, through great mountains, and over deep
                    valleys ; being built on ſtately arches, and furniſhing the higheſt parts of the
                    city. He made alſo an haven at Oſtia ; a work of ſuch immenſe expence, that his
                    ſucceffors were unable to maintain it. But his greateſt work of all was the
                    draining of the lake Fucinus, which was the largeſt in Italy, and bringing its
                    water into the Tiber, in order to ſtrengthen the current of that river. For
                    effecting this, among other vaſt difficulties, he mined through a mountain of
                    ſtone three miles broad, and kept 30,000 men eu∣ployed for 11 years together.</p>
                <p>To this ſolicitude for-the internal advantages of the ſtate, he added that of a
                    watchful guardianſhip over the provinces. He reſtored Judea to Herod Agrippa,
                    which Caligula had taken from Herod Antipas, his uncle, the man who had put John
                    the Baptiſt to death, and who was baniſhed by order of the preſent emperor.
                    Claudius alſo reſtored ſuch princes to their kingdoms as had been unjuſtly
                    diſpoſſeſſed by his predeceſſors ; but deprived the Lycians and Rhodians of
                    their liberty, for having promoted inſurrections, and crucified ſome citizens of
                    Rome.</p>
                <p>He even undertook to gratify the people by foreign conqueſt. The Britons, who
                    had, for near too years, been left in ſole pofſeſfion of their own iſland, began
                    to ſeek the mediation of Rome, to quell their inteſtine commotions. The
                    principal man who deſired to ſubject his native country to the Roman dominion,
                    was</p>
                <p>one Bericus, who, by many arguments, perſuaded the emperor to make a deſcent
                    upon the iſland, m.ιgnify-ing the advantages that would attend the conqneſt of
                    it. In purſuance of his advice, therefore, Plautius the praetor was ordered to
                    paſs over into Gaul, and make preparations for this great expedition. At firſt,
                    indeed, his ſoldiers ſeemed backward to embark ; declaring, that they were
                    unwilling to make war beyond the limits of the w <hi rend="sup">r</hi> orld,
                    for ſo they judged Britain to be. However, they were at laſt perſuaded to go ;
                    and the Britons, under the conduct of their king Cynobelinus, were ſeveral times
                    overthrown. And theſe ſucceſſes ſoon after induced Claudius to go into Britain
                    in perſon, upon pretence that the natives were ſtill ſeditious, and had not
                    delivered up ſome Roman fugitives who had taken ſhelter among them ; but for a
                    particular account of the exploits of the Romans in this iſland, ſee the article
                    England.</p>
                <p>But though Claudius gave in the beginning of his reign the higheſt hopes of an
                    happy continuance, he ſoon be fan to leſſen his care for the public, and to
                    commit to his favourites all the concerns of the empire. This weak prince was
                    unable to act but under the direction of others. The chief of his directors was
                    his wiſe Meſſalina : whoſe name is almoſt become a common appellation to women
                    of abandoned characters. However, ſhe was not leſs remarkable for her cruelties
                    than her luſts ; as by her intrigues ſhe deſtroyed many of the moſt illuſtrious
                    families of Rome. Subordinate to her were the emperor’s'ſreedmen ; Pallas, the
                    trea-ſurer ; Narciſſus, the ſecretary of ſtate ; and Calliſtus, the maſter of
                    the requeſts. Theſe entirely governed Claudius; ſo that he was only left
                    the.fatigues of ceremony, while they were poſſeſſed of all the power of the
                    ſtate.</p>
                <p>It would be tedious to enumerate the various cruelties which theſe inſidious
                    adviſers obliged the feeble emperor to commit : thoſe againſt his own family
                    will ſuſfice. Appius Silanus, a perſon of great merit, who had been married to
                    the emperor’s mother-in-law, was put to death upon the ſuggeſtions of Meſſalina.
                    After him lie flew both his ſons-in-law, Silanus and Pompey, and his two nieces
                    the Livias, one the daughter of Druſus, the other of Germanicus ; and all
                    without permitting them to plead in their defence, or even without affigning any
                    cauſe for his diſpleaſure. Great numbers of others fell a ſacriſice to the
                    jealouſy of Meſ-ſalina and her minions ; who bore ſo great a ſway in the ſtate,
                    that all offices, dignities, and governments, were entirely at their diſpoſal.
                    Every thing was put to ſale : they took money for pardons and penalties ; and
                    accumulated, by theſe means, ſuch vaſt ſums, that the wealth of Crœfus was
                    conſidered as nothing in compariſon. One day, the emperor complaining that his
                    exchequer was exhauſted, he was ludicrouſly told, that it might be ſufficiently
                    repleniſlied if his two ſreedmen would take him into partnerſhip. Still,
                    however, during ſuch corruption, he regarded his favourites with the higheſt
                    eſteem, and even ſolicited the ſenate to grant them peculiar marks of their
                    approbation. Theſe diſorders in the miniſters of government did not fail to
                    produce conſpiracies againſt the emperor. Statius Corvinus and Gallus Affinius
                    formed a conſpiracy againſt him Two knights, whoſe names are not told us,
                    privately combined to aſſaſſinate him. But the revolt</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0409" facs="gri_33125011196389_0415.tif"/>
                <p>which gave him the greateſt uneaſinefe, and which was puniſhed with the moſt
                    unrelenting ſeverity, was that of Camillus, his lieutenant-general in Dalmatia.
                    This general, incited by many of the principal men of Rome, openly rebelled
                    againſt him, and aſſumed the title of <hi rend="italic">emperor.</hi> Nothing
                    could exceed the terrors of Claudius, upon being informed of this revolt : his
                    nature and his crimes had diſpoſed him to be more cowardly than the reſt of
                    mankind ; ſo that when Camillus commanded him by letters to relinquiſh the
                    empire, and retire to a private ſtation, he ſeemed inclined to obey. However,
                    his fears upon this occaſion were ſoon removed : for the legions which had
                    declared for Camillus being terrified by ſome prodigies, ſhortly after abandoned
                    him ; ſo that the man whom but five days before they bad acknowledged as
                    emperor, they now thought it no infamy to deſtroy. The cruelty of Meſſalina and
                    her minions upon this occaſion ſeemed to have no bounds. They ſo wrought upon
                    the emperor’s fears and ſuſpicions, that numbers were executed without trial or
                    proof; and ſcarce any, even of thoſe who were but ſuſpected, eſeaped, unleſs by
                    ranſoming their lives with their fortunes.</p>
                <p>By ſuch cruelfie9 as theſe, the favourites of the emperor endeavoured to
                    eſtabliſh his and their own authority : but in order to increaſe the neceſſity
                    of their aſſiſtance, they laboured to augment the greatneſs of his terrors. He
                    now became a prey to jealouſy and diſ-quietude. Being one day in the temple, and
                    finding a ſword that was left there by accident, he convened the ſenate in a
                    fright, and informed them of his danger. After this he never ventured to go to
                    any feaſt without being ſurrounded by his guards, nor would he ſuffer any man to
                    approach him without a previous ſearch. Thus wholly employed by hist anxiety for
                    ſelf-preſervation, he entirely left the care of the ſtate to his favourites, who
                    by degrees gave him a reliſh ſor daughter. From this time he ſeemed delighted
                    with inflicting tortures ; and on a certain occaſion continued ä whole day at
                    the city Tibur, waiting for an hangman from Rome, that he might feaſt his eyes
                    with an execution in the manner of the ancients. Nor was he leſs regardleſs of
                    the perſons he condemned, than cruel in the infliction of their puniſhment. Such
                    was his extreme ſtupidſty, that he would frequently invite thoſe to ſupper whom
                    he had put to death but the day before ; and often denied the having given
                    orders for an execution, but a few hours after pronouncing ſentence. Suetonius
                    aſſures us, that there were no leſs than 35 ſenators, and above 300 knights,
                    executed in his reign ; and that ſuch was hie unconcern in the midſt of
                    ſlaughter, that one of the tribunes bringing him an account of a certain ſenator
                    who was executed, he quite forgot his offence, but calmly acquieſced in his
                    puniſhment.</p>
                <p>In this manner was Claudius urged on by Meſſalina to commit cruelties, which he
                    conſidered only as wholeſome ſeverities ; while, in the mean time, ſhe put no
                    bounds to her enormities. The impunity of her paſt vices only increaſing her
                    confidence to commit new, her debaucheries became every day more notorious, and
                    her lewdneſs exceeded what had ever been ſeen at Rome. She cauſed ſome women of
                    the firſt quality to commit adultery in the pr eſence of their huſhands, and
                    deſtroyed ſuch as refuſed to comply. After appearing for</p>
                <p>ſome years inſatiable in her deſires, ſhe at length fixed her affections upon
                    Caius Silius, the moſt beautiful youth in Rome. Her love for the young Roman
                    ſeemed to amount even to madneſs. She obliged him to divorce his wiſe Junia
                    Syllana, that ſhe might entirely poſſeſs him herſelf. She obliged him to accept
                    of immenſe treaſures and valuable preſents ; cohabiting with him in the moſt
                    open manner, and treating hi n with the moſt ſhameleſs familiarity. The very
                    imperial ornaments were transferred to his houſe ; and the emperor’s ſlaves and
                    attendants had orders to wait upon the adulterer. Nothing was wanting to
                    complete the inſolence of their conduct, but their being married together ; and
                    this was ſoon after effected. They relied upon the emperor’s imbecility for
                    their ſecurity, and only waited till he retired to Oſtia to put their ill-judged
                    project in execution. In his abſence, they celebrated their nuptials with all
                    the ceremonies and ſplendor which attend the moſt confident ſecurity. Meſſalina
                    gave a looſe to her paſſion, and appeared as a Bacchanalian with a thyrſus in
                    her hand ; while Silius aſſumed the character of Bacchus, his body being adorned
                    with robes imitating ivy, and his legs covered with buſhins. A troop of fingers
                    and dancers attend, ed, who heightened thg revel with the moſt laſcivious ſongs
                    and the moſt indecent attitudes. In the midſt of this riot, one Valens, a
                    buffoon, is ſaid to have climbed a tree ; and being demanded what he ſaw,
                    anſwered that he perceived a dreadſul ſtorm coming from Oſtia. What this fellow
                    ſpoke at random was actually at that time in preparation. It ſeems that ſome
                    time before there had been a quarrel between Meſſalina and Narciſſus, the
                    emperor’s firſt freedman. This ſubtle miniſter therefore deſired nothing more
                    than an opportunity of ruining the empreſs, and he judged this to be a moſt
                    favourable occaſion. He firſt made the diſcovery by means of two concubines who
                    attended the emperor, who were inſtructed to inform him of Meſſa-lina’s marriage
                    as the news of the day, while Narciſſus himſelf ſtepped in to confirm their
                    information. Finding it operated upon the emperor’s fears as he could wiſh, he
                    reſolved to alarm him ſtill more by a diſcovery of all Meſſalina’s projects and
                    attempts. He aggravated the danger, and urged the expediency of ſpeed sly
                    puniſlimg the delinquents. Claudius, quite terrified at ſo unexpected a
                    relation, ſuppoſed the enemy were already at his gates ; and frequently
                    interrupted his freedman, by aſking if he was ſtill maſter of the empire. Being
                    aſſured that he yet had it in his power to continue ſo, he reſolved to go and
                    puniſh the affront offered to his dignity without delay. Nothing could exceed
                    the conſternation of Meſſalina and her thought-leſs companions, upon being
                    informed that the emperor was coming to diſturb tſheir feſtivity. Every one
                    retired in the utmoſt confuſion. Silius was taken. Meſſalina took ſhelter in
                    ſome gardens which ſhe had lately ſeized upon, having expelled Aſiaticus the
                    true owner, and put him to death. From thence ſhe ſent Britannicus, her only ſon
                    by the emperor, with Octavia her daughter, to intercede for her, and implore his
                    mercy. She ſoon after followed them herſelf ; but Narciſſus had ſo fortified the
                    emperor againſt her arts, and contrived ſuch methods of diverting his attention
                    from her defence, that ſhe was obliged to return in deſpair. Narciſſus being
                    thus far ſucceſsſul, led Claudius</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0410" facs="gri_33125011196389_0416.tif"/>
                <p>to the houſe of the adulterer, there ſhowing him the apartments adorned with the
                    ſpoils of his own palace ; and then conducting him to the prætorian camp,
                    revived his courage by giving him aſſurances of the readineſs of the ſoldiers to
                    defend h.im. Having thus artfully wrought upon his fears and reſentment, the
                    wretched Silius was commanded to appear ; who, making no defence, was inſtantly
                    put to death in the emperor’s preſence. Several others ſhared the ſame fate ;
                    but Meſſalina ſtill flattered herſelf with hopes of pardon. She reſolved to
                    leave neither prayers nor tears .unattempted to appeaſe the emperor. She
                    ſometimes even gave a looſe to her reſentment, and threatened her ac-cuſers with
                    vengeance. Nor did ſhe want ground for entertaining the moſt favourable
                    expectations. Claudius having returned from the execution of her paramour, and
                    having allayed his reſentment in a banquet, began to relent. He now therefore
                    commanded his attendants to appriſe that miſerable creature, meaning Meſſalina,
                    of his reſolution to hear her accuſation the next day, and ordered her to be in
                    readineſs with her defence. The permiſſion to defend herſelf would have been
                    fatal to Narciſſus ; wherefore he ruſhed out, and ordered the tribunes and
                    centurions who were in readineſs to execute her immediately by the emperor’s
                    Command. Claudius was informed of her death in the midſt of his banquet ; but
                    this inſenſible idiot ſhowed not the leaſt appearance of emotion. He continued
                    at table with his uſual tranquillity ; and the day following, while he was
                    ſitting at dinner, he aſhed why Meſſalina was abſent, as if he had totally
                    forgotten her crimes and her puniſhment. «</p>
                <p>Claudius being now a widower, declared publicly, that as he had hitherto been
                    unfortunate in his marriages, he would remain ſingle for the future, and that he
                    would be contented to forfeit his life in caſe he broke his reſolution. However,
                    the reſolutions of Claudius were but of ſhort continuance. Having been
                    accuſtomed to live under the controul of women, his preſent freedom was become
                    irkſome to him, and he was entirely unable to live without a director. His
                    freedmen therefore perceiving his inclinations, reſolved to procure him another
                    wiſe ; and, after ſome deliberation, they fixed upon Agrippina, the daughter of
                    his brother Germanicus. This woman was more practiſed in vice than even the
                    former empreſs. Her cruelties were more dangerous, as they were directed with
                    greater caution : ſhe had poiſoned her former huſhand, to be at liberty to
                    attend the calls of ambition ; and, perfectly acquainted with all the
                    infirmities of Claudius, only made uſe of his power to advance her own. However,
                    as the late declaration of Claudius ſeemed to be an obſtacle to his marrying
                    again, perſons were ſuborned to move in the ſenate, that he ſhould be compelled
                    to take a wiſe, as a matter of great importance to the commonwealth ; and ſome
                    more determined flatterers than the reſt left the houſe, as with a thorough
                    reſolution, that inſtant, to conſtrain him. When this decree paſſed in the
                    ſenate, Claudius had ſcarce patience to contain himſelf a day before the
                    celebration of his nuptials. However, ſuch was the deteſtation in which the
                    people in general held theſe inceſtuous matches, that though they were made
                    lawful, yet only one of his tribunes, and one of his freedmen, followed his
                    example.</p>
                <p>Claudius having now received a new director, ſub*</p>
                <p>mitted with more implicit obedience than in any former part of his reign.
                    Agrippina’s chief aims were to gain the ſucceſſion in favour of her own ſon
                    Nero, and to ſet aſide the claims of young Britannicus, ſon to the emperor and
                    Meſſalina. For this purpoſe ſhe married Nero to the emperor’s daughter Octavia,
                    a few days after her own marriage, Not long after this, ſhe urged the emperor to
                    ſtrengthen the ſucceſſion, in imitation of his predeceſſors, by making a new
                    adoption ; and cauſed him take in her ſon Nero, in ſome meaſure to divide the
                    fatigues of government. Her next care was to increaſe her ſon’s popularity, by
                    giving him Seneca for a tutor. This excellent man, by birth a Spaniard, had been
                    baniſhed by Claudius, upon the falſe teſtimony of Meſſalina, who had accuſed him
                    of adultery with Julia the emperor’s niece. The people loved and admired him ſor
                    his genius, but ſtill more for his ſtrict morality ; and a part of his
                    reputation neceſſarily devolved to his pupil. This ſubtle woman was not leſs
                    aſſiduous in pretending the utmoſt affection for Britannicus ; whom, however,
                    ſhe reſolved in a proper time to deſtroy : but her jealouſy was not confined to
                    this child only ; ſhe, ſhortly after her acceſſion, procured the deaths of
                    ſeveral ladies who had been her rival in the emperor’s affections. She diſplaced
                    the captains of the guard, and appointed Burrhus to that command; a perſon of
                    great military knowledge, and ſtrongly attached to her intereſts. From that time
                    ſhe took left pains to diſguiſe her power, and frequently entered the Capitol in
                    a chariot ; a privilege which none before were allowed, except of the ſacerdotal
                    order.</p>
                <p>In the 12th year of this monarch’s reign, ſhe perſuaded him to reſtore liberty
                    to the Rhodians, of which he had deprived them ſome years before ; and to remit
                    the taxes of the city Ilium, as having been the progenitors of Rome. Her deſign
                    in this was to increaſe the popularity of Nero, who pleaded the cauſe of both
                    cities with great approbation. Thus did this ambitious woman take every ſtep to
                    aggrandize her ſon, and was even contented to become hateful herſelf to the
                    public, merely to increaſe his popularity.</p>
                <p>Such a very immoderate abuſe of her power ſerved at laſt to awaken the emperor’s
                    ſuſpicions. Agrippina’s imperious temper began to grow inſupportable to him ;
                    and he was heard to declare, when heated with wine, that it was his fate to
                    ſuffer the diſorders of his wives, and to be their executioner. This expreſſion
                    ſunk deep on her mind, and engaged all her faculties to prevent the blow. Her
                    firſt care was to remove Narciſſus, whom ſhe hated upon many accounts, but
                    particularly for his attachment to Claudius. This minifter, for ſome time,
                    oppoſed her deſigns ; but at length thought fit to retire, by a voluntary exile,
                    into Campania. The unhappy emperor, thus expoſed to all the machinations of his
                    inſidious confort, ſeemed entirely regardleſs of the dangers that threatened his
                    deſtruction. His affection ſor Britannicus was perceived every day to increaſe,
                    which ſerved alſo to increaſe the vigilance and jealouſy of Agrippina. She now,
                    therefore, reſolved not to defer a crime which ſhe had meditated a long while
                    before ; namely, that of poiſoning her huſhand. She for ſome time, however,
                    debated with herſelf in what manner ſhe ſhould adminiſter the poiſon ; as file
                    feared too ſtrong a doſe would diſcover her treachery, and one too weak might
                    fail of its effect</p>

                <p>At length ſhe determined upon a poiſoii of Angular efficacy to deſtroy his
                    intellects, and yet not ſuddenly to terminate his life. As ſhe had been long
                    conversant in this horrid practice, ſhe applied to a woman called <hi
                        rend="italic"> Locuſta,</hi> notorious for aſſiſting on ſuch occaſions.
                    ∙*Γhe poiſon was given to the emperor among muſhrooms, a diſh he was
                    particularly fond of. Shortly after having eaten, he dropped down inſenſible ;
                    but this cauſed no alarm, as it was uſual with him to fit eating till he had
                    ſtupified all his faculties, and was obliged to be carried off to his bed from
                    the table. However, his conſtitution ſeemed to overcome the effects of the
                    potion, when Agrippina reſolved to make ſure of him : wherefore ſhe directed a
                    wretched phyſician, who was her creature, to thruſt a poiſoned feather down his
                    throat, under pretence of making him vomit ; and this diſpatched him.</p>
                <p>The reign of the emperor, feeble and impotent as he was, produced no great
                    calamities in the ſtate, ſince his cruelties were chiefly levelled at thoſe
                    about his perſon. The liſt of the inhabitants of Rome at this time amounted to
                    ſix millions eight hundred and forty-four thouſand ſouls ; a number little
                    inferior to all the people of England at this day. The general character of the
                    times was that of corruption and luxury : but the military ſpirit of Rome,
                    though much relaxed ſrom its former ſeverity, ſtill continued to awe mankind ;
                    and though during this reign, the empire might be juſtly ſaid to be without a
                    head, yet the terror of the Roman name alone kept the nations in obedience.</p>
                <p>Claudius being deſtroyed, Agrippina took every precaution to conceal h13 death
                    from the public, until ſhe had ſettled her meaſures for ſecuring the ſucceſſion.
                    A ſtrong guard was placed at all the avenues of the palace, while ſhe amuſed the
                    people with various reports ; at one time giving out that he was ſtill alive ;
                    at another, that he was recovering. In the meanwhile, ſhe made ſure of the
                    perſon of young Britannicus, under a pretence of affection for him. Like one
                    overcome with the extremity of her grief, ſhe held the child in her arms,
                    calling him the dear image of his ſather, and thus preventing his eſcape. She
                    uſed the ſame precautions with regard to his fiffer3, Octavia and Antonia ; and
                    even ordered an entertainment in the palace, as if to amuſe the emperor. At
                    laſt, when all things were adjuſted, the palace-gates were thrown open, and
                    Nero, accompanied by Burrhus, prefect of the Prætorian guards, iſſued to receive
                    the congratulations of the people and the army. The cohorts then attending,
                    proclaimed him with the loudeſt acclamations, though not without making ſome
                    inquiries after Britannicus. He was carried in a chariot to the reſt of the army
                    ; wherein having made a ſpeech proper to the occaſion, and promiſing them a
                    donation, in the manner of his predeceſſors, he was declared emperor by the
                    army, the ſenate, and the people.</p>
                <p>Nero’s firſl care was, to ſhow all poſſible reſpect to the deceaſed emperor, in
                    order to cover the guilt of his death. His obſequies were performed with a pomp
                    equal to that of Auguſtus : the young emperor pronounced his- funeral oration,
                    and he was -canonized among the gods. The funeral oration, though ſpoken by
                    Nero, was drawn up by Seneca ; and it was remarked, that this was the firſt time
                    a Roman emperor needed the aſſiſtance of another’s eloquence.</p>
                <p>Nero, though but ï 7 years of age, began his reign with the general approbation
                    of mankind. As he owed the empire to Agrippina, ſo in the beginning he ſubmitted
                    to her directions with the moſt implicit obedience. On her part, ſhe ſeemed
                    reſolved on governing with her natural ferocity, and conſidered her private
                    animoſities as the only rule to guide her in public juſtice. Immediately after
                    the death of Claudius, ſhe cauſed Silanus, the pro-conſul of Aſia, to be
                    aſſaſſinated upon very flight ſuſpicions, and without ever acquainting the
                    emperor with her deſign. The next object of her reſentment was Narciſſus, the
                    late emperor’s favourite ; a man equally notorious for the greatneſs of his
                    wealth and the number of his crimes. He was obliged to put an end to his life by
                    Agrippina’s order, though Nero refuſed his conſent.</p>
                <p>This bloody onſet would have been followed by many ſeverities of the ſame
                    nature, had not Seneca and Burrhus, the emperor’s tutor and general, oppoſed.
                    Theſe worthy men, although they owed their riſe to the empreſs, were above being
                    the inſtruments of her cruelty. They, therefore, combined together in an
                    oppoſition ; and gaining the young emperor on their ſide, formed a plan of
                    power, at once the moſt merciful and wiſe. The beginning of this monarch’s
                    reign, while he continued to act by their counſels, has always been conſidered
                    as a model for ſucceeding princes to govern by. The famous emperor Trajan uſed
                    to ſay, “ That for the firſt five years of this prince all other governments
                    came ſhort of his.” In fact, the young monarch knew ſo well how to conceal hrs
                    innate depravity, that his neareſt friends could ſcarce perceive his virtues to
                    be but aſſumed. He appeared juſt, liberal, and humane. when a warrant for the
                    execution of a criminal was brought to him to be ſigned, he was heard to cry
                    out, with ſeeming concern, “ Would to Heaven that I had never learned to write
                    !” The ſenate, upon a certain occaſion, giving him their applauſe ſor the
                    regularity and juſtice of his adminiſtration ; he replied with lingular modeſty,
                    « That they ſhould defer their thanks till he had deſerved them.” His
                    condeſcenſion and affability were not leſs than his other virtues ; ſo that the
                    Romans began to think, that the clemency of this prince would compenſate for the
                    tyranny of his predeceſſors.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, Agrippina, who was excluded from any ſhare in government,
                    attempted, by every poſſible method, to maintain her declining power. Perceiving
                    that her ſon had fallen in love with a freed-woman, named <hi rend="italic">A8e,</hi> and dreading the influence of a concubine, ſhe tried every art to
                    prevent his growing paſſion. However, in ſo corrupt a court, it was no difficult
                    matter for the emperor to find other -confidents ready to aſſiſt him in his
                    wiſhes. The gratification of his paſſion, therefore, in this inſtance, only
                    ſerved to increaſe his hatred for the empreſs. Nor was it long before he gave
                    evident marks of his diſobedience, by diſplacing Pallas her chief favourite. It
                    was upon this occaſion that ſhe firſt perceived the total declenſion of her
                    authority ; which threw her into the moſt ungovernable fury. In order to give
                    terror to her rage, ſhe proclaimed that Britannicus, the real heir to the
                    throne, was ſtill living, and in a condition ’ to receive his father’s empire,
                    which was now poſſeſſed by an uſurper. She threatened to go to the camp, and</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0412" facs="gri_33125011196389_0418.tif"/>
                <p>there expoſe his baſeneſs and her own, invoking all the furies to her
                    aſſiſtance. Theſe menaces ſerved to alarm the ſuſpicions of Nero ; who, though
                    apparently guided by his governors, yet had begun to give way to his natural
                    depravity. He, therefore, determined upon the death of Britannicus, and
                    contrived lo have him poiſoned at a public banquet. Agrippina, however, ſtill
                    retained her natural ferocity : ſhe took every opportunity of obliging and
                    flattering the tribunes and centurions ; ſhe heaped up treaſures with a rapacity
                    beyond her natural avarice ; all her actions ſeemed calculated to raiſe a
                    faction, and make herſelf formidable to the emperor. Whereupon Nero commanded
                    her German guard to be taken ſrom her, and obliged her to lodge out of the
                    palace. He alſo forbid particular perſons to viſit her, and went himſelf but
                    rarely and ceremo-niouſly to pay her his reſpects. She now, therefore, began to
                    find, that, with the emperor’s favour, ſhe had loſt the aſſiduity of her
                    friends. She was even accuſed by Silana of conſpiring againſt her ſon, and of
                    deſigning to marry Plautius, a perſon deſeended from Auguſtus, and of making him
                    emperor. A ſhort time aſter, Pallas, her favourite, together with Burrhus, were
                    arralgned for a ſimilar offence, and intending to ſet up Cornelius Sylla. Theſe
                    informations being proved void of any foundation, the informers were baniſhed ;
                    a puniſhment which was conſidered as very inadequate to the greatneſs of the
                    offence.</p>
                <p>As Nero increaſed in years, his crimes ſeemed to increaſe in equal proportion.
                    He now began to find a pleaſure in running about the city by night, diſguiſed
                    like a ſlave. In this vile habit he entered taverns and brothels, attended' by
                    the lewd miniſters of his pleaſure,«, attempting the lives of ſuch as oppoſed
                    him, and frequently endangering his own. In imitation of the emperor’s example,
                    numbers of profligate young jr en inſeſted the ſtreets likewiſe ; ſo that every
                    night the city was filled with tumult and diſorder. However, the people bore all
                    theſe levities, which they aſ-cribed to the emperor’s youth, with patience,
                    having occaſion every day to experience his liberality, and having alſo been
                    gratified by the abolition of many of their taxes. The provinces alſo were no
                    way affected by theſe riots ; for except diſturbances on the ſide of the
                    Parthians, which were ſoon ſuppreſſed, they enjoyed the moſt perfect
                    tranquillity.</p>
                <p>But thoſe ſenſualitie», which, ſor the firſt four years of his reign, produced
                    but tew diſorders, in the fifth became alarming. He firſt began to tranſgreſs
                    the bounds of decency, by publicly abandoning Octavia, his preſent wife, and
                    then by taking Poppea, the wiſe of his favourite Otho, a woman more celebrated
                    ſor her beauty than her virtues. This was another grating circumſtance to
                    Agrippina, who vainly uſed all her intereſt to diſgrace Poppea, and reinſtate
                    herſelf in her ſon’s loſt favour. Hiſtorians aſſert, that ſhe even offered to
                    ſatisfy his paſſion herſelf, by an inceſtuous compliance and that, had not
                    Seneca interpoſed, the ſon would have joined in the mother’s crime. This,
                    however, does not ſeem probable, ſince we find Poppea vic-torious, ſoon after,
                    in the contention of intereſts ;· and at laſt impelling Nero to parricide, to
                    ſatisfy her revenge. She began her aits by urging him to divorce his preſent
                    wife, and marry herſelf : ſhe reproached him a; <hi rend="italic">ύ</hi> pupil, who wanted not only power over others, but.</p>
                <p>liberty to direct himſelf. She inſinuated the danger0u3 deſigns of Agrippina ;
                    and, by degrees, accuſtomed his mind to reflect on parricide without horror, H13
                    cruelties againſt his mother began rather by various circumſtances of petty
                    malice than by any downright in. jury. He encouraged ſeveral perlons to teaſe
                    her with litigious ſuits; and employed ſome of the meaneſt of the people to ling
                    ſatirical ſongs againſt her, under her windows : but, at laſt, finding theſe
                    ineffectual in breaking her ſpirit, he reſolved on putting her to death. His
                    firſt attempt was by poiſon ; but this, though twice repeated, proved
                    ineffectual, as ſhe had fortified her conſtitution againſt it by antidotes. This
                    failing, a ſhip was contrived in ſo artificial a manner as to fall 10 pieces in
                    the water ; on board of which ſhe was invited to ſail to the coaſts of Calabria.
                    However, this plot was as ineffectual as the former : the mariners, not being
                    ap-priſed of the ſecret, diſturbed each other’s operations ; ſo that the ſhip
                    not finking as readily as was expected, Agrippina found means to continue
                    ſwimming, till ſhe was taken up by ſome trading veſſels paſſing that way. Nero
                    finding all his machinations were diſcovered, reſolved to throw off the maſk,
                    and put her openly to death, without further delay. He therefore cauſed a report
                    to be ſpread, that ſhe had conſpired againſt him, and that a poniard was dropped
                    at his ſeet by one who pretended a command from Agrippina to aſſaſſinate him. In
                    conſequence of this, he applied to his governors Seneca and Burrhus, for their
                    advice how to act, and their aſſiſtance in ridding him of his fears. Things were
                    now come to ſuch a criſis, that no middle way could bε taken ; and either Nero
                    or Agrippina was to fall. Seneca, therefore, kept a profound ſilence ; while
                    Burt hus, with more reſolution, refuſed to be perpetrator of ſo great a crime ;
                    alleging, that the army was entirely devoted to all the deicendants of Cæſar,
                    and would never be brought to imbrue their hands in the blood of any of his
                    family. In this embarraſſment, Anicetus, the contriver of the ſhip
                    above-mentioned, offered his ſervices ; which Nero accepted with the greateſt
                    joy, crying out, “ That then was the firſt moment he ever found himſelſ an
                    emperor.” This freedman, therefore, taking with him a body of ſoldiers,
                    ſurrounded the houſe of Agrippina, and then forced open the doors. The
                    executioners having diſpatched her with ſeveral wounds, left her dead on the
                    couch, and went to inform Nero of what they had done. Some hiſtorians ſay, that
                    Nero came immediately to view the body ; that he continued to gaze upon it with
                    pleaſure, and ended his horrid ſurvey, by coolly obſerving, that he never
                    thought his mother had been ſo handſome»— However this be, he vindicated his
                    conduct, next day to the ſenate ; who not only excuſed, but applauded his
                    impiety.</p>
                <p>AH the bounds of virtue being thus broken down,. Nero now gave a looſe to his
                    appetites* that were not only fordid but inhuman. There ſeemed an odd cop-traſt
                    in his diſpoſition ; for while he practiſed cruelties which were ſufficient to
                    make the mind ſhudder with horror, he was fond of thoſe amuſing arts that ſoften
                    and refine the heart. He was particularly addicted, even, from childhood, to
                    muſic, and not totally ignorant of poetry. But chariot-driving was his favourite
                    purſuit. He never miſſed the circus, when chariot-races were to be exhibited
                    there ; appearing at firſt privately, and</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0413" facs="gri_33125011196389_0419.tif"/>
                <p>ſoon after publicly ; till at laſt, hie paſſion increaſing by indulgence, he vas
                    riot content with being merely a ſpectator, but reſolved to become one of the
                    principal performers. His governors, however, did all in their power to reſtrain
                    this perverted ambition ; but finding him reſolute, they incloſed a ſpace of
                    ground in the valley of the Vatican, where he firſt exhibited only to ſome
                    choſen ſpectators, but ſhortly after invited the whole town. The praiſes of his
                    flattering ſubjects only ſlimulated him ſtill more to theſe unbecoming pur-ſuits
                    ; ſo that he now reſolved to allume a new character, and to appear as a finger
                    upon the ſtage.</p>
                <p>His paſſion for muſic, as was obſerved, was no leſs natural to him than the
                    former ; but as it was leſs man-lv, ſo he endeavoured to defend it by the
                    example of Tome of the moſt celebrated men, who practiſed it with the ſame
                    fondneſs. He had been inſtructed in the the principles of this art from his
                    childhood ; and upon his advancement to the empire, hc had put himſelf under the
                    moſt celebrated maſters. He patiently ſubmitted to their inſtructions, and uſed
                    ail thoſe methods which fingers practice, either to mend the voice, or improve
                    its volubility. Yet, notwithſtanding all his aſſiduity, his voice was but a
                    wretched one, being both feeble and unpltaſant. However, he was reſolved to
                    produce it to the public, ſuch as it was ; for flattery, he knew, would ſupply
                    every deficiency. His firſt public appearance was at games of his own
                    inſtitution, called <hi rend="italic">juveniles</hi> ; where he advanced upon
                    the ſtage, tuning his inſtrument to his voice with great appearance of ſkill. A
                    group of tribunes and centurions attended behind him ; when his old governor Bun
                    hus ſtood by his hopeful pupil, with indignation in his countenance, and praiſes
                    on his lips.</p>
                <p>He was deſirous alſo of becoming a poet : hut he was unwilling to undergo the
                    pain of ſtudy, which a proficiency in that art requires ; he was délirons of
                    being a poet ready made. For this purpoſe, he got together ſeveral perſons, who
                    were conſidered as great wits at court, though but very little known as ſuch to
                    the public. Theſe attended him with verſes which they had compoſed at home, or
                    which they blabbed out ex-temporaneouſly ; and the whole of their compoſitions
                    being tacked together, by his direction, was called a <hi rend="italic">poem.</hi> Nor was he without his philoſophers alſo ; he took a pleaſure in hearing
                    their debates after ſupper, but he heard them merely for his amuſement.</p>
                <p>Furniſhed with ſuch talents as theſe for giving pleaſure, he was reſolved to
                    make the tour of his empire, and. give the moſt public diſplay of his abilities
                    wherever he came. The place of his firſt exhibition, upon leaving Rome, was
                    Naples. The crowds there were ſo great, and the curioſity of the people ſo
                    earned in hearing him, that they did not perceive an earthquake that happened
                    while he was ſinging. His deſire of gaining the ſuperiority over the other
                    actors was truly ridiculous : he made intereſt with his judges, reviled his
                    competitors, formed private factions to ſupport him, all in imitation of thoſe
                    who got their livelihood upon the ſtage. While he continued to perform,, no man
                    was permitted to depart from the theatre, upon any pretence whatſoever. Some
                    were ſo· fatigued with hearing him, that they leaped privately from the walls,
                    or pretended to fall into fainting fits, in order to be.</p>
                <p>carried out. Nay, it is ſaid, that ſeveral women were delivered in the theatre.
                    Syldiers were placed in ſeveral parts to obſerve the looks and geſtures of the
                    ſpectators, either to direct them where to point their applauſe, or reſtrain
                    their diſpleaſure. An old ſenator, named <hi rend="italic">Pef-paſian,</hi> afterwards emperor, happening to-fall aſleep upon one of theſe occaſions, very
                    narrowly eſeaped with his li'ſe. <hi rend="sub">i</hi></p>
                <p>After bring fatigued with the praiſes of his coun. trymen, Nero reſolved upon
                    going over into Greece, to receive new theatrical honours. The occaſion was
                    this. The cities of Greece had made a law to ſend him the crowns from all the
                    games ; and deputies were accordingly diſpatched with this (to him) important
                    embaſſy. As he one day entertained them at his table in the moſt ſumptuou»
                    manner, and converged with them with the utmoſt familiarity, they intreated to
                    hear him fing. Upon his complying, the artſul Greeks teſtified all the marks of
                    ecſtafy and rapture. Applauſes ſo warm were peculiarly pleaſing to Nero : he
                    could not refrain from crying out, That the Greeks alone were worthy to hear him
                    ; and accordingly prepared without delay to go into Greece, where he ſpent the
                    whole year· enſuing. In this journey, his retinue reſembled an army in number ;
                    but it was only, compoſed of fingers, dancers, taylors, and other attendants
                    upon the theatre, ht paſſed over all Greece, and exhibited at all their games,
                    which he ordered to be celebrated in one year. At the 'Olympic games he reſolved
                    to ſhow the people ſomething extraordinary ; wherefore, he drove a chariot with
                    io horſes ; but being unable to ſuſtain the violence of the motion, he was
                    driven ſrom his ſeat. The ſpectators, however, gave their unanimous applauſe,
                    and,, he was crowned as conqueror. In this manner he obtained the prize at the
                    Ifthmian, Pythian, ana Nemean games. The Greeks were not ſparing of their
                    crowns; he obtained 1800 of them. An unfortunate finger happened to oppoſe him
                    on one of theſe occaſions, and exerted all the powers of his art, which, it
                    appears,, were prodigious. But he ſeems to have been a better finger than a
                    politician ; for Nero ordered him to be killed on the ſpot. Upon his return ſrom
                    Greece, he entered Naples, through a breach in the walla of the city, as was
                    cuſtomary with thoſe who were conquerors in the Olympic games. But all the
                    ſplendor of his return was reſerved for his entry into Rome. There he appeared
                    ſeated in the chariot of Auguſtus, dreſſed in robes of purple, and crowned with
                    wild olive, which was the Olympic garland. He bore in his hand the Pythian
                    crown, and had I loo more carried before him.— Befide him ſat one Diodorus, a
                    muſician; and behind him followed a band of fingers, as numerous as a legion,
                    who ſung in honour of his victories. The ſenate, the knights, and the people,
                    attended this puerile pageant, filling the air with their acclamations. The
                    whole city was illuminated, every ſtreet ſmoked with incenſe;. wherever he
                    paſted, victims were ſiain ; the pavement was ſtrewed with ſaſt’ron, while
                    garlands of flowers,, ribbons, fowls, and paſties, (for ſo we are told), were
                    ſhowered down upon him from the window’s as he pall-ed along. So many honours
                    only inflamed his deſires of acquiring new; he at laſt began to take leſtons in
                    wreſtling; willing to imitate Hercules in ſtrength, as he had rivalled
                    Ag&lt;≈&gt;llo in activity. He alſo cauſed a.</p>

                <p>lion of paſteboard to be made with great art, againſt which he undauntedly
                    appeared in the theatre, and ſtruck it down with a blow of his club.</p>
                <p>But his cruelties even outdid all his other extravagancies, a complete liſt of
                    which would exceed the limits of the preſent article. He was often heard to
                    obſerve, that he had rather be hated than loved. When one happened to ſay in his
                    preſence, That the world might be burned when he was dead: Nay,” replied</p>
                <p>Nero, " let it be burnt while I am alive.” In fact, a great part of the city of
                    Rome was conſumed by fire ſhortly after. This remarkable conflagration took
                    place in the nth year of Nero’s reign. The fire began among certain ſhops, in
                    which were kept ſuch goods as were proper to feed it ; and ſpread every way with
                    ſuch amazing rapidity, that its havock was felt in diſtant ſtreets, before any
                    meaſures to flop it could be tried. Beſides an infinite number of common houſes,
                    all the noble monuments of antiquity, all the ſtately palaces, temples,
                    porticoes, with goods, riches, furniture, and merchandize, to an immenſe value,
                    were devoured by the flames, which raged firſt in the low regions of the city,
                    and then mounted to the higher with ſuch terrible violence and impetuoſity, as
                    to fruſtrate all relief. The ſhrieks of the women, the various efforts of ſome
                    endeavouring to ſave the young and tender, of others attempting to aſſiſt the
                    aged and infirm, and the hurry of ſuch as ſtrove only to provide for themſelves,
                    occaſioned a mutual interruption and univerſal confuſion. Many, while they
                    chiefly regarded the danger that purſued them from behind, found themſelves
                    ſuddenly involved in the flames before and on every ſide. If they eſcaped into
                    the quarters adjoining, or into the parts quite remote, there too they met with
                    the devouring flames. At laſt, not knowing whither to fly, nor where to ſeek
                    ſanctuary, they abandoned the city, and repaired to the open fields. Some, out
                    of deſpair for the loſs of their whole ſubſtance, others, through tenderneſs for
                    their children and relations, whom they had not been able to ſnatch from the
                    flames, ſuffered themſelves to periſh in them, though they might eaſily have
                    found means to eſcape. No man dared to ſtop the progreſs of the fire, there
                    being many who had no other buſineſs hut to prevent with repeated menaces all
                    attempts of that nature ; nay, ſome were, in the face of the public, ſeen to
                    throw lighted fire-brands into the houſes, loudly declaring that they were
                    authoriſed ſo to do ; but whether this was only a device to plunder more freely,
                    or in reality they had ſuch orders, was never certainly known.</p>
                <p>Nero, who was then at Antium, did not offer to return to the city, till he heard
                    that the flames were advancing to his palace, which, after his arrival, was, in
                    ſpite of all oppoſition, burnt down to the ground, with all the houſes adjoining
                    to it. However, Nero, affecting compaſſion for the multitude, thus vagabond and
                    bereft of their dwellings, laid open the field of Mars, and all the great
                    edifices erected there by Agrippa, and even his own gardens. He likewiſe cauſed
                    tabernacles to be reared in haſte for the reception of the forlorn populace ;
                    from Oſtia, too, and the neighbouring cities, were brought, by his orders, all
                    ſorts of furniture and neceſſaries, and the price of corn was conſiderably
                    leſſened. But theſe bounties, however generous and popular, were beſtowed in
                    vain, becauſe a report &gt;as ſpread abroad, that, during the time of this
                    gent.</p>
                <p>ral conflagration, he mounted his domeſtſe ſtage, and ſung the deſtruction of
                    Troy, comparing the preſent deſolation to the celebrated calamities of
                    antiquity. At length, on the ſixth day, the fury of the flames was flopped at
                    the foot of mount Eſquiline, by levelling with the ground an infinite number of
                    buildings ; ſo that the fire found nothing to encounter but the open fields and
                    empty air.</p>
                <p>But ſcarce had the late alarm ceaſed, when the fire broke out anew with freſh
                    rage, but in places more wide and ſpacious ; whence fewer perſons were
                    deſtroyed, but more temples and public porticoes were overthrown. As this ſecond
                    conflagration broke out incertain buildings belonging to Tigellinus, they were
                    both generally aſcribed to Nero ; and it was conjectured, that, by deſtroying
                    the old city, he aimed at the glory of building a new one, and calling it by his
                    name. Of the fourteen quarters into which Rome was divided, four remained
                    entire, three were laid in aſhes, and, in the ſeven others, there remained here
                    and there a few houſes, miſerably ſhattered, and half conſumed. Among the many
                    ancient and ſtately edifices, which the rage of the flames utterly conſumed,
                    Tacitus reckons the temple dedicated by Servius Tullius to the Moon ; the temple
                    and great altar conſecrated by Evander to Hercules ; the chapel vowed by Romulus
                    to Jupiter Stator ; the court of Numa, with the temple of Veſta, and in it the
                    tutelar gods peculiar to the Romans. In the ſame fate were involved the
                    ineſtimable treaſures acquired by ſo many victories, the wonderful works of the
                    beſt painters and ſculptors of Greece, and, what is ſtill more to be lamented,
                    the ancient writings of celebrated authors, till then preſerved perfectly
                    entire. It was obſerved, that the fire began the ſame day on which the Gauls,
                    having formerly taken the city, burnt it to the ground.</p>
                <p>Upon the ruins of the demoliſhed city, Nero founded a palace, which he called
                    his <hi rend="italic">golden houſe ;</hi> though it was not ſo much admired on
                    account of an immenſe profuſion of gold, precious ſtones, and other ineſtimable
                    ornaments, as for its vaſt extent, containing ſpacious fields, -large
                    wilderneſſes, artificial lakes, thick woods, orchards, vineyards, hills, groves,
                    &amp;c. The entrance of this ſtately edifice was wide enough to receive a
                    coloſſus, repreſenting Nero, 120 feet high : the galleries, which conſiſted of
                    three rows of tall pillars, were each a full mile in length ; the lakes were
                    encom∙ paſſed with magnificent buildings, in the manner of cities ; and the
                    woods flocked with ail manner of wild beaſts. The houſe itſelf was tiled with
                    gold : the walls were covered with the ſame metal, and richly adorned with
                    precious ſtones and mother-of-pearl, which in thoſe days was valued above gold :
                    the timber-work and ceilings of the rooms were inlaid with gold and ivory : the
                    roof of one of the banqueting-rooms reſembled the firmament both in its figure
                    and motion, turning inceſſantly about night and day, and ſhowering all ſorts of
                    ſweet waters. When this magnificent ſtructure was finiſhed, Nero approved of it
                    only ſo far as to ſay, that <hi rend="italic">at length he began to lodge like
                        a man.</hi> Pliny tells us, that this palace extended quite round the city.
                    Nero, it ſeems, did not finiſh it ; for the firſt order Otho ſigned was, as we
                    read in Suetonius, for fifty millions of ſeſterces to be employed in perfecting
                    the golden palace which Nero had begun.</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0415" facs="gri_33125011196389_0421.tif"/>
                <p>The projectors of the plan were Severua and Celer; two bold and enterpriſing
                    men, who ſoon after put the emperor upon a ſtill more expenſive and arduous
                    undertaking, namely, that of cutting a canal through hard rocks and ſteep
                    mountains, from the lake Avernus tσ the mouth of the Tiber, ι6□ miles in length,
                    and of ſuch breadth that two galleys of five ranks of oars might eaſily paſs
                    abreaſt. His view in this was to open a communication between Rome and Campania,
                    free from the troubles and dangers of the ſea ; for, this very year, a great
                    number of veſſels laden with corn were ſhip-wrecked at Miſenum, the pilots
                    chooſing rather to venture out in a violent ſtorm, than not to arrive at the
                    time they were expected by Nero. For the executing of this great undertaking,
                    the emperor ordered the priſoners from all parts to be tranſported into Italy ;
                    and ſuch as were convicted, whatever their ’Crimes were, to be condemned only to
                    his works. Nero, who undertook nothing with more ardour and readineſs than what
                    was deemed impoſſible, expended incredible ſums in this raſh undertaking, and
                    exerted all his might to cut through the mountains adjoining to the lake Avernus
                    ; but, not being able to remove by art the obſtacles of nature, he was in the
                    end obliged to drop the enterpriſe.</p>
                <p>The ground that was not taken up by the foundations of Nero’s own palace, he
                    aſſigned for houſes, which were not placed, as after the burning of the city by
                    the Gauls, at random, and without order ; but the ſtreets were laid out
                    regularly, ſpacious and ſtraight ; the edifices reſtrained to a certain height,
                    perhaps of 70 feet, according to the plan of Auguſtus ; the courts were widened
                    ; and to all the great houſes which ſtood by themſelves, and were called <hi
                        rend="italic"> ifles,</hi> large porticoes were added, which Nero engaged
                    to raiſe at his own expence, and to deliver to each proprietor the ſquares about
                    them clear from all rubbiſh. He likewiſe promiſed rewards according to every
                    man’s rank and ſub-ſtance ; and fixed a day for the performance of his promiſe,
                    on condition that againſt that day their ſeveral houſes and palaces were
                    finiſhed. He moreover made the following wiſe regulations to obviate ſuch a
                    dreadful calamity for the future ; to wit, That the new buildings ſhould be
                    raiſed to a certain height without timber ; that they ſhould be arched with
                    ſtone from the quarries of Gabii and Alba, which were proof againſt fire ; that
                    over the common ſprings, which were diverted by private men for their own uſes,
                    overſeeers ſhould be placed to prevent that abuſe ; that every citizen ſhould
                    have ready in his houſe ſome machine proper to extinguiſh the fire ; that no
                    wall ſhould be common to two houſes, but every houſe be incloſed within its own
                    peculiar walls, &amp;c. Thus the city in a ſhort time roſe out of its aſhes
                    with new luſtre, and more beautiful than ever. However, ſome believed, that the
                    ancient form was more conducing to health, the rays of the ſun being hardly felt
                    on account of the narrowneſs of the ſtreets, and the height of the buildings,
                    whereas now there was no ſhelter againſt the ſcorching heat. We are told, that
                    Nero deſigned to extend the walls to Oſtia, and to bring from thence by a canal
                    the ſea into the city.</p>
                <p>The emperor uſed every art to throw the odium of this conflagration upon the
                    Chriſtians, who were at that time gaining ground in Rome, Nothing could</p>
                <p>be more dreadful than the perſecution raiſed againſt them upon this falſe
                    accuſation, of which an account is given under the article <hi rend="italic">EccLfiaſlical HιsτoBr.</hi> Hitherto, ho v-ever, the citizens of Rome
                    ſeemed comparatively exempted from his cruelties, which chiefly fell upon
                    ſtrangers and his neareſt connections ; but a conſpiracy formed againſt him by
                    Pifσ, a man of great power and integrity, which was prematurely diſcovered,
                    opened a new train of ſuſpicions that deſtroyed many of the principal families
                    in Rome. This conſpiracy, in which ſeveral of the chief men of the city were
                    concerned, was firſt diſcovered by the indiſcreet zeal of a woman named <hi
                        rend="italic"> Epicharis,</hi> who, by ſome means now unknown, had been let
                    into the plot, which ſhe revealed to Voluſius, a tribune, in order to prevail
                    upon him to be an accomplice. Voluſius, inſtead of coming into her deſign, went
                    and diſcovered what he had learned to Nero, who immedi-ately put Epicharis in
                    priſon. Soon after, a freedman belonging to Scænius, one of the accomplices,
                    made a farther diſeovery. The conſpirators were examined apart ; and as their
                    teſtimonies differed, they were put to the torture. Natalis was the firſt who
                    made a con-feſſion of his own guilt and that of many others. Scae-nius gave a
                    liſt of the conſpirators ſtill more ample. Lucan, the poet, was amongſt the
                    number ; and he, like the reſt, in order to ſave himſelf, ſtill farther enlarged
                    the catalogue, naming, among others, Attilia, his own mother. Epicharis was now,
                    therefore, again called upon and put to the torture ; but her fortitude was
                    -proof againſt all the tyrant’s cruelty ; neither ſcourging nor burning, nor all
                    the malicious methods uſed by the executioners, could extort the ſmalleſt
                    conſeſſion. She was therefore remanded to priſon, with orders to have her
                    tortures renewed the day following. In the meantime, ſhe found an opportunity of
                    ſti angling herſelf with her handkerchief, by hanging it againſt the back of her
                    chair. On the diſeoveries already made, Piſo, Lateranus, Fennius Rufus, Subrius
                    Flavius; Sulpicius Aſper, Veſtinus the conſul, and numberleſs others, were all
                    executed without mercy. But the two moſt remarkable perſonages who fell on this
                    occaſion were Seneca the philoſopher, and Lucan the poet, who was his nephew. It
                    is not certainly known whether Seneca was really concerned in this conſpiracy or
                    not.—-This-great man had for ſome time perceived the outrageous conduct of his
                    pupil ; and, finding himſelf incapable of controuling his ſavage diſpoſition,
                    had retired from court into ſolitude and privacy. However, his retreat did not
                    now protect him ; for Nero, either having real teſtimony againſt him, or elſe
                    hating him' for his virtues, ſent a tribune to inform him that he was ſuſpected
                    as an accomplice, and ſoon after ſent him an order to put himſelf to death, with
                    which he complied.</p>
                <p>In this manner was the whole city filled with ſlaLighter, and frightful
                    inſtances of treachery. No maſter was ſecure from the vengeance of his ſlaves,
                    nor even parents from the baſer attempts of their children. Not· only throughout
                    Rome, ſhut the whole country round, bodies of ſoldiers were ſeen in purſuit of
                    the ſuſpected and the guilty. Whole crowds of wretches loaded with chains were
                    led every day to the gates of the palace, to wait their ſentence from the
                    tyrant’s own lips. He airways j&gt;refided at the torture in perſen,

                <p>gellinus, captain of the guard, who, from being the moſt abandoned man in Rome,
                    was now become his principal miniſter and favourite.</p>
                <p>Nor were the Roman provinces in a better ſituation than the capital city. The
                    example of the tyrant ſeemed to influence his governors, who gave inſtances not
                    only of their rapacity, but of their cruelty, in every part of the empire. In
                    the ſeventh year of his reign, the Britons revolted, under the conduct of their
                    queen Boadicea<note anchored="true" place="margin" type="suthorial">See <hi
                            rend="italic">England.</hi></note>; but were at laſt ſo completely
                    defeated, that ever after, during the continuance of the Romans among them, they
                    loſt not only all hopes, but even all deſire of freedom.</p>
                <p>A war alſo was carried on againſt the Parthians for the greateſt part of this
                    reign, conducted by Corbulo ; who, after many ſucceſſes, had diſpoſſeſſed
                    Tiridates, and ſettled Tigranes in Armenia in his room. Tiridates, however, was
                    ſoon after reſtored by an invaſion of the Parthians into that country ; but
                    being once more oppoſed by Corbulo, the Romans and Parthians came to an
                    agreement, that Tiridates ſhould continue to govern Armenia, upon condition that
                    he ſhould lay down his crown at the ſeet of the emperor’s ſtatue, and receive it
                    as coming from him ; all which he ſhortly after performed. A ceremony, however,
                    which Nero deſired to have repeated to his perſon ; wherefore by letters and
                    promiſes he invited Tiridates to Rome, granting him the moſt magnificent
                    ſupplies ſor his journey. Nero attended liis arrival with very ſumptuous
                    preparations. He received him ſeated on a throne, accompanied by the ſenate
                    ſtanding round him, and the whole army drawn out with all imaginable ſplendor.—
                    Tiridates aſcended the throne with great reverence ; and approaching the emperor
                    ſell down at his ſeet, and in the moſt abject terms acknowledged himſelf his
                    ſlave. Nero raiſed him up, telling him with equal arrogance, that he did well,
                    and that by his ſubmiflion he had gained a kingdom which his anceſtors could
                    never acquire by their arms. He then placed the crown on his head, and, after
                    the moſt coſtly ceremonies and entertainments, he was ſent back bo Armenia, with
                    incredible ſums of money to defray the expences of his return.</p>
                <p>In the X2th year of this emperor’s reign, the Jews alſo revolted, having been
                    ſeverely oppreſſed by the Roman governor. It is ſaid that Florus, in particular,
                    was arrived at that degree of tyranny, that by public proclamation he gave
                    permiſſion to plunder the country, provided he received half the ſpoil. Theſe
                    oppreſſions drew ſuch a train of calamities after them, that the ſufferings of
                    all other nations were flight in compariſon to what this devoted people
                    afterwards endured, as is related under the article Jews. In the mean time, Nero
                    proceeded in his cruelties at Rome with unabated ſeverity.</p>
                <p>The valiant Corbulo, who had gained ſo many victories over the Parthians, could
                    not eſcape his fury. Nor did the empreſs Poppæa herſelſ eſcape ; whom, in a fit
                    of anger, he kicked when ſhe was pregnant, by which ſhe miſcarried and died. At
                    laſt the Romans began to grow weary of ſuch a monſter, and there appeared a
                    general revolution in all the provinces.</p>
                <p>The firſt appeared in Gaul, under Julius Vindex, who commanded the legions
                    there, and publicly proteſted againſt the tyrannical government of Nero. He
                    appeared to have no other motive for tlſis revolt than that of freeing the world
                    from an oppreffor ; for when it was told him that Nero had ſet a reward upon his
                    head of I o, ooo,ooo of ſeſterces, he made this gallant anſwer, “ Whoever brings
                    me Nero’s head, ſhall, if he pleaſes, have mine.” But ſtill more to ſhow that he
                    was not actuated by motives of private ambition, he proclaimed Sergius Galba
                    empepor, and invited him to join in the revolt. Galba, who was at that time
                    governor of Spain, was equally remarkable for his wiſdom in peace and his
                    courage in war. But as all talents under corrupt princes are dangerous, he for
                    ſome years had ſeemed willing to court obſcurity, giving himſelf up to an
                    inactive liſe, and avoiding all opportunities of ſig-nalizing his valour. He now
                    therefore, either through the caution attending old age, or from a total want of
                    ambition, appeared little inclined to join with Vindex, and continued for ſome
                    time to deliberate with his friends on the part he ſhould take.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, Nero, who had been appriſed of the proceedings againſt him in
                    Gaul, appeared totally regardleſs of the danger, privately flattering himſelf
                    that the ſupprefiion of this revolt would give him an opportunity of freſh
                    confiſcations. But the actual revolt of Galba, the news of which arrived ſoon
                    after, affected him in a very different manner. The reputation of that general
                    was ſuch, that from the moment he declared againſt him, Nero conſidered himſelf
                    as undone. He received the account as he was at ſupper ; and inſtantly, ſtruck
                    with terror, overturned the table with his foot, breaking two cryſtal vaſes of
                    immenſe value. He then ſell into a ſwoon ; from which when he recovered he tore
                    his clothes, and ſtruck his head, crying out, “ that he was utterly undone.” He
                    then began to meditate ſlaughters moιe extenſive than he yet had committed. He
                    reſolved to maſſacre all the governors of provinces, to deſtroy all exiles, and
                    to murder all the Gauls in Rome, as a puniſhment for the treachery of their
                    countrymen. In ſhort, in the wildneſs of his rage, he thought of poiſoning the
                    whole ſenate, of burning the city, and turning the lions kept for the purpoſes
                    of the theatre out upon the people. »· Theſe deſigns being impracticable, he
                    reſolved at laſt to face the danger in perſon. But his very preparations ſerved
                    to mark the infatuation of his mind. His principal care was, to provide waggons
                    for the convenient carriage of his mu-ſical inſtruments ; and to dreſs out his
                    concubines like. Amazons, with whom he intended to face the enemy. He alſo made
                    a reſolution, that if he came off with ſafe-ty and empire, he would appear again
                    upon the theatre with the lute, and would equip himſelf as a pantomime.</p>
                <p>While Nero was thus frivolouſly employed, the revolt became general. Not only
                    the armies in Spain and Gaul, but alſo the legions in Germany, Africa, and
                    Luſitania, declared againſt him. Virginius Rufus alone, who commanded an army on
                    the Upper Rhine, for a while continued in ſuſpenſe ; during which his forces,
                    without his permiſſion, falling upon the Gauls, routed them with great
                    ſtaughter, and Vindex flew himſelf. But this ill ſucceſs no way advanced the
                    intereſts of Nero ; he was ſo deteſted by the whole empire, that he could find
                    none of the armies faithful to him, however they might diſagree with each other.
                    He therefore called for Locuſta to furniſh him with poiſon ; and, thus, prepared
                    for the worſt, he retired to the Servilian gar-</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0417" facs="gri_33125011196389_0423.tif"/>
                <p>all-fours, and took a ſhort repoſe upon a wretched pallet, that had been
                    prepared for his reception. Being preſſed by hunger, he demanded ſomewhat to eat
                    : they brought him a piece of brown bread, which he refuſed; but he, drank a
                    little water. During this interval, the ſenate finding the prætorian guards had
                    taken part with Galba, declared him emperor, and condemned Nero to die <hi
                        rend="italic"> more majorum ;</hi> that is, “ according to the rigour of
                    the ancient laws,” Theſe dreadful tidings were quickly brought by one of Phaon’s
                    ſlaves from the city, while Nero yet continued lingering between his hopes and
                    his fears. When he was told of the reſolution of the ſenate againſt him, he
                    aſhed the meſſenger what he meant by being puniſhed “ according to the rigour of
                    the ancient laws ?” To this he was anſwered, that the criminal was to be
                    ſtripped naked, his head was to be fixed in a pillory, and in that poſture he
                    was to be ſcourged to death. Nero was ſo terrified at this, that he ſeized two
                    poniards which he had brought with him, and examining their points, returned
                    them to their ſheaths, ſaying, that the fatal moment was not yet arrived.
                    However, he had little time to ſpare ; for the ſoldiers who had been ſent in
                    purſuit of him were juſt then approaching the houſe : wherefore hearing the
                    ſound of the horſe’s feet, he ſet a dagger to his throat, with which, by the
                    aſſiſtance of Epaphroditus, his freedman and ſecretary, he gave himſelf a mortal
                    wound. He was dot quite dead when one of the centurions entering the room, and
                    pretending he came to his relief, attempted to ſtop the blood with his cloak.
                    But Nero, regarding him with a ſtern countenance, ſaid, “ It is now too late. Is
                    this your fidelity?”—∙ Upon which, with his eyes fixed, and frightfully ſtaring,
                    he expired, in the 32d year of his age, and the 14th of his reign.</p>
                <p>Galba was.72 years old when he was' declared emperor, and was then in Spain with
                    his legions. However, he ſoon ſound that his being raiſed to the throne was but
                    an inlet to ne* <hi rend="sup">,</hi> disquietudes. His firſt embarraſſment
                    aroſe from a diſorder in his own army ; for upon his approaching the camp, one
                    of the wings of horſe repenting of their choice, prepared to revolt, and he
                    found it no eaſy matter to reconcile them to their duty, h e alſo narrowly
                    eſcaped aſſaſſination from ſome ſlaves, who were preſented to him by one of
                    Nero’s freedmen with that intent. The death of Vindex alſo ſerved to add not a
                    little to his diſquietudes ; ſo that, upon his very entrance into the empire, he
                    had ſome thoughts of putting an end to his own liſe. But hearing from Rome that
                    Nero was dead, and the empire transferred to him, he immediately aſſumed the
                    title and enſigns of command. In his journey towards Rome he was met by Rufus
                    Virginius, who, finding the ſenate had decreed him the government, came to yield
                    him obedience. This general had more than once refuſed the empire himſelf, which
                    was offered him by his ſoldiers ; alleging, that the ſenate alone had the
                    diſpoſal of it, and from them only he would accept the honour.</p>
                <p>Galba having been brought to the empire by means of his army, was at the ſame
                    time willing to ſuppreſs their power to commit any future diſturbance. His firſt
                    approach to Rome was attended with one of thoſe rigorous ſtrokes of juſtice
                    which ought rather to be denominated <hi rend="italic">cruelty</hi> than any
                    thing elſe. A body of ma-</p>
                <p>dens, with a reſolution of flying into Egypt. He accordingly diſpatched the
                    freedmen, in which he had the moſt confidence, to prepare a fleet at Oſtia ; and
                    in the meanwhile founded, in perſon, the tribunes and centurions of the guard,
                    to know if they were willing to ſhare his fortunes. But they all excuſed
                    themſelves, under divers pretexts. One of them had the boldneſs to anſwer him by
                    part of a line from Virgil : <hi rend="italic">Ulque αdeone miſerum eft mori ?</hi> “ Is death then ſuch a misfortune ?” Thus deſtitute of every reſource, all
                    the expedients that cowardice, revenge, or terror could produce, took place in
                    his mind by turns. He at one time reſolved to take refuge among the Parthians ;
                    at another, to deliver himſelf up to the mercy of the inſurgents : one while, he
                    determined to mount the roſtrum, to aik pardon for what was paſt, and to
                    conclude with promiſes of amendment for the future. With theſe gloomy
                    deliberations he went to bed ; but waking about midnight, he was ſurpriſed to
                    find his guards had left him. The prætorian ſoldiers, in fact, having been
                    corrupted by their commander, had retired to their camp, and proclaimed Galba
                    emperor. Nero immediately ſent for his friends to deliberate upon his preſent
                    exigence ; but his friends alſo forſeok him. He went in perſon from houſe to
                    houſe ; but all the doors were ſhut againſt him, and none were found to anſwer
                    his inquiries. While he was purſuing this inquiry, his very domeſtics followed
                    the general defection ; and having plundered his apartment, eſeaped different
                    ways. Being now reduced to deſperation, he defιred that one of his favourite
                    gladiators might come and diſpatch him : but even in this requeſt there was none
                    found to obey. “ Alas! (cried he) have I neither friend nor enemy ?” And then
                    running deſperately forth, he ſeemed reſolved to plunge headlong into the Tiber.
                    But juſt then his courage beginning to fail him, he made a ſudden ſtop, as if
                    willing to recollect his reaſon ; and aſked for ſome ſecret place, where he
                    might re-aſſume his courage, and meet death with becoming fortitude. In this
                    diſtreſs, Phaon, one of his freedmen, offered him his country-houſe, at about
                    four miles diſtant, where he might for ſome time remain concealed. Nero accepted
                    his offer ; and, half-dreſſed as he was, with his head covered, and hiding his
                    face with an handkerchief, he mounted on horſeback, attended by four of his
                    domeſtics, of whom the wretched Sporus was one. His journey, though quite ſhort,
                    was crowded with adventures. Round him he heard nothing but confuſed noiſes from
                    the camp, and the cries of the ſoldiers, imprecating a thouſand evils upon his
                    head. A paffenger, meeting him on the way, cried, * <hi rend="sup">i</hi> There go men in purſuit of Nero.” Another alked him, if there was any news of
                    Nero in the city ? His horſe taking fright at a dead body that lay near the
                    road, he dropped his handkerchief ; and a ſoldier that was near, addreſſed him
                    by name. He now therefore quitted his horſe, and forſaking the highway, entered
                    a thicket that led towards the back part of Phaon’s houſe, through which he
                    crept, making the beſt of his way among the reeds and brambles, with which the
                    place was overgrown. When he was arrived at the back part of the houſe, while he
                    was waiting till there ſhould be a breach made in the wall, he took up ſome
                    water in the hollow of his hands from a pool to drink ; ſaying, " To this liquor
                    is Nero reduced.” When the hole Was made large enough to admit him, he crept in
                    upon</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0418" facs="gri_33125011196389_0424.tif"/>
                <p>rmers, whom Nero had taken from the oar and enliſted among the legions, went to
                    meet Galba, three miles from the city, and with loud importunities demanded a
                    confirmation of what his predeceſſor had done in their favour. Galba, who was
                    rigidly attached to the ancient diſcipline, deferred their requeſt to another
                    time. But they, conſidering this delay as equivalent to an abſolute denial,
                    infilled in a very difreſpectful manner ; and ſome of them even had recourſe to
                    arms : whereupon Galba ordered a body of horſe attending him to ride in among
                    them, and thus killed 7000 of them ; but not content with this puniſhment, he
                    afterwards ordered them to be decimated. Their inſolence demanded correction ;
                    but ſuch extenſive puniſhments deviated into cruelty. His next ſtep to curb the
                    inſolence of the ſoldiers, was his diſeharging the German cohort, which had been
                    eſtabliſhed by the former emperors as a guard to their perſons. Thoſe he ſent
                    home to their own country unrewarded, pretending they were diſaffected to his
                    perſon. He ſeemed to have two other objects alſo in view ; namely, to puniſh
                    thoſe vices which had come to an enormous height in the laſt reign, with the
                    ſtricteſt ſeverity ; and to repleniſh the exchequer, which had been quite
                    drained by the prodigality of his predeceſſors. But theſe attempts only brought
                    on him the imputation of ſeverity and avarice ; for the ſtate was too much
                    corrupted to admit of ſuch an immediate tranſition from vice to virtue. The
                    people had long been maintained in ſloth and luxury by the prodigality of the
                    former emperors, and could not think of being obliged to ſeek for new means of
                    ſubfiftence, and to retrench their ſu-perfluities. They began, therefore, to
                    ſatirize the old man, and turn the ſimplicity of his manners into ridicule.
                    Among the marks of avarice recorded of him, he is ſaid to have groaned upon
                    having an expenſive ſoup ſerved up to his table ; he is ſaid to have preſented
                    to his ſteward, for his fidelity, a plate of beans ; a famous player upon the
                    flute, named <hi rend="italic">Canus,</hi> having greatly delighted him, it is
                    reported, that he drew out his purſe, and gave him five-pence, telling him, that
                    it was private and not public money. By ſuch ill-judged frugalities, at ſuch a
                    time, Galba began to loſe his popularity ; and he, who before his acceſſion was
                    eſteemed by all, being become emperor, √was conſidered with ridicule and
                    contempt. But there*are ſome circumſtances alleged againſt him, leſs equivocal
                    than thoſe trifling ones, already mentioned. Shortly after his coming to Rome,
                    the people were preſented with a moſt grateful ſpectacle, which was that of
                    Locuſta, Eli us, Policletus, Petro-nius, and Petinus, all the bloody miniſters
                    of Nero’s cruelty, drawn in fetters through the city, and publicly executed. But
                    Tigellinus, who had been more active than all the reſt, was not there. The
                    crafty villain had taken care for his own ſafety, by the largeneſs of his bribes
                    ; and though the people cried out for vengeance againſt him at the theatre and
                    at the circus, yet the emperor granted him his life and pardon. Helotus the
                    eunuch, alſo, who had been the inſtrument of poiſoning Claudius, eſcaped, and
                    owed his ſafety to the proper application of his wealth. Thus, by the inequality
                    of his conduct, he became deſpicable to his ſubjects. At one time ſhe wing
                    himſelf ſevere, and frugal, at another remiſs and prodigal ; condemning ſorne
                    illuſtrious perſons without any hearing, and pardoning others though guilty in
                    ſhort, nothing was done but</p>
                <p>by the mediation of his favourites ; all offices were venal, and all puniſhments
                    redeemable by money.</p>
                <p>Affairs were in this unſettled poſture at Rome, when the provinces were yet in
                    a· worſe condition. The ſucceſs of the army in Spain in chooſing an emperor
                    induced the legions in the other parts to wiſh for a ſimi-lar opportunity.
                    Accordingly, many ſeditions were kindled, and ſeveral factions promoted in
                    different parts of the empire, but particularly in Germany. There were then in
                    that province two Roman armies ; the one which had lately attempted to make
                    Rufus Virginius emperor, as has been already mentioned, and which was commanded
                    by his lieutenant ; the other commanded by Vitellius, who long had an ambition
                    to obtain the empire for himſelf. The former of theſe armies deſpiſing their
                    preſent general, and conſidering themſelves as ſuſpected by the emperor for
                    having been the laſt to acknowledge his title, reſolved now to be foremoſt in
                    denying it. Accordingly, when they were ſummoned to take the oaths of homage and
                    fidelity, they refuſed to acknowledge any other commands but thoſe of the
                    ſenate. This- refuſal they backed by a meſſage of the prætorian bands,
                    importing, that they were reſolved not to acquieſce in the election of an
                    emperor created in Spain, and deſiring that the ſenate ſhould proceed to a new
                    choice.</p>
                <p>Galba being informed of this commotion, was ſenſible, that, beſides his age, he
                    was leſs reſpected for want of an heir. He reſolved therefore to put what he had
                    formerly deſigned in execution, and to adopt-ſome perſon whoſe virtues might
                    deſerve ſuch advancement, and protect his declining age from danger. His
                    favourites underſtanding his determination, inſtantly reſolved to give him an
                    heir of their own chooſing ; ſo that there aroſe a great contention among them
                    upon this occaſion. Otho made warm application for himſelf ; alleging the great
                    ſervices he had done the emperor, as being the firſt man of note who came to his
                    aſſiſtance when he had declared againſt Nero, However, Galba, being fully
                    reſolved to conſult the public good alone, rejected his fuit ; and on a day
                    appointed ordered Piſo Lucinianus to attend him. The character given by
                    hiſtorians of Piſo is, that he was every way worthy of the honour deſigned him.
                    He was noway related to Galba ; and had no other intereſt but merit to recommend
                    him to his favour. Taking this youth therefore by the hand, in the preſence of
                    his friends, he adopted him to ſucceed in the empire* giving him the moſt
                    wholeſome leffons for guiding his future conduct. Pifo’s conduct ſhowed that he
                    was highly deſerving this diſtinction : in all his deportment there appeared
                    ſuch modeſty, firmneſs, and equality of mind, as beſpoke him rather capable of
                    diſeharging, than ambitious of obtaining, his preſent dignity. But the army and
                    the ſenate did not ſeem equally difιnte-reſted upon this occaſion ; they had
                    been ſo long uſed to bribery and corruption, that they could now bear no emperor
                    who was not in a capacity of ſatisfying their avarice. The adoption, therefore
                    of Piſo was but coldly received ; for his virtues were no recommendation in a
                    nation of univerſal depravity.</p>
                <p>Otho now finding his hopes of adoption wholly fruſtrated, and ſtill further
                    ſtimulated by the immenſe load of debt which he had contracted by his riotous
                    way of living, reſolved upon obtaining the empire by force,</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0419" facs="gri_33125011196389_0425.tif"/>
                <p>ſince he could not by peaceable ſucceſſion. In fact, his circumſtances were ſo
                    very deſperate, that he was heard to ſay, that it was equal to him whether he
                    fell by his enemies in the field or by his creditors in the city. He therefore
                    raiſed a moderate ſum of money, by felling his intereſt to a perſen who wanted a
                    place ; and with this bribed two ſubaltern officers in the prætorian bands,
                    ſupplying the deficiency of largeſſes by promiſes and plauſible pretences.
                    Having in this manlier, in leſs than eight days, corrupted the fidelity of "the
                    ſoldiers, he ſtole ſecretly from the emperor while he was ſacriſicing ; and
                    aſſembling the ſoldiers, in a ſhort ſpeech urged the cruelties and avarice of
                    Galba. Finding theſe his invectives received with univerſal ſhouts by the whole
                    army, he entirely threw off the maſk, and avowed his intentions of dethroning
                    him. The ſoldiers being ripe for ſedition, immediately ſeconded his views:
                    taking Otho upon their ſhoulders, they inſtantly proclaimed him emperor ; and,
                    to ſtrike the citizens with terror, carried him with their ſwords drawn into the
                    camp.</p>
                <p>Galba, in the mean time, being informed of the revolt of the army, ſeemed
                    utterly confounded, and in want of ſufficſent reſolution to face an event which
                    he ſhould have long foreſeen. In this manner the poor old man continued wavering
                    and doubtful ; till at laſt, being deluded by a falſe report of Otho’s being
                    ſlain, he rode into the forum in complete armour, attended by many of his
                    followers. Juſt at the ſame inſtant a body of horſe ſent ſrom the camp to
                    deſtroy him entered on the oppoſite ſide, and each party prepared for the
                    encounter. For ſome time hoſtilities were ſuſpended on each ſide ; Galba,
                    conſuſed and irreſolute, and his antagoniſts ſtruck with horror at the baſeneſs
                    of their enterpriſe. At length, however, finding the emperor in ſome meaſure
                    deſerted by his adherents, they ruſhed in upon him, trampling under foot the
                    crowds of people that then filled the forum. Galba ſeeing them approach, ſeemed
                    to recollect all his former fortitude ; and bending his head forward, bid the
                    aſſaſſins ſtrike it off if it were for the good of the people. This was quickly
                    performed ; and his head being ſet upon the point of a lance, was preſented to
                    Otho, who ordered it to be contemptuouſly carried round the camp ; his body
                    remaining expoſed in the ſtreets till it was buried by one of his ſlaves. He
                    died in the 73d year of his age, after a ſhort reign of ſeven months.</p>
                <p>No ſooner was Galba thus murdered, than the ſenate and people ran in crowds to
                    the camp, contending who ſhould be foremoſt in extolling the virtues of the new
                    emperor, and depreſſing the character of him they had ſo unjuſtly deſtroyed.
                    Each laboured to excel the reſt in his inſtances of homage ; and the leſs his
                    affections were for him, the more did he indulge all the vehemence of
                    exaggerated praiſe. Otho finding himſelſ ſurrounded by congratulating
                    multitudes, immediately repaired to the ſenate, where he received the titles
                    uſually given to the emperors ; and from thence returned to the palace,
                    ſeemingly reſolved to reform his liſe, and aſſume manners becoming the greatneſs
                    of his ſtation.</p>
                <p>He began his reign by a ſignal inſtance of clemency, in pardoning Marius Celſus,
                    who had been highly favoured by Galba ; and not contented with barely forgiving,
                    he advanced him to the higheſt honours ; aſ-ſerting, that " fidelity deſerved
                    every reward.” Thia act of clemency was followed by another of juſtice, equally
                    agreeable to the people. Tigellinus, Nero’s favourite, he who had been the
                    promoter of all his cruelties, was now put to death ; and all ſuch as had been
                    unjuſtly baniſhed, or ſtripped, at his inſtigation, during Nero’s reign, were
                    reſtored to their country and fortunes.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the legions in Lower Germany having been purchaſed by the
                    large gifts and ſpecious promiſes of Vitellius their general, were at length
                    induced to proclaim him emperor ; and regardleſs of the ſenate, declared that
                    they had an equal right to appoint to that high ſtation with the cohorts at
                    Rome. The news of this conduct in the army ſoon ſpread conſternation throughout
                    Rome ; but Otho was particularly ſtruck with the account, as being apprehenſive
                    that nothing but the blood of his countrymen could decide a conteſt of which his
                    own ambition only was the cauſe. He now therefore ſought to come to ail
                    agreement with Vitellius; but this not ſucceeding, both ſides began their
                    preparations for war. News being received that Vitellius was upon his march to
                    Italy, Otho departed from Rome with a vaſt army to oppoſe him. But though he was
                    very powerful with regard to numbers, his men, being little uſed to war, could
                    not be relied on. He ſeemed by his behaviour ſenſible of the diſproportion of
                    his forces ; and he is ſaid to have been tortured with frightful dreams and the
                    moſt uneaſy apprehenſions. It is alſo reported by ſome, that one night fetching
                    many profound ſighs in his ſleep, his ſervants ran haſtily to his bed-ſide, and
                    found him ſtretched on the ground. He alleged he had ſeen the gſhoſt of Galba,
                    which had, in a threatening manner, beat and puſhed him from the bed ; and he
                    afterwards uſed many expiations to appeaſe it. However this be, he proceeded
                    with a great ſhow of courage till he arrived at the city of Bιfixellum, on the
                    river Po, where he remained, ſending his forces before him under the conduct of
                    his generals Suetonius and Celfus, who made what haſte they could to give the
                    enemy battle. The army of Vitellius, which conſiſted of 70,000 men, was
                    commanded by his generals Valens and Cecina, he himſelf remaining in Gaul in
                    order to bring up the reſt of his forces. Thus both ſide# haſtened to meet each
                    other with ſo much animoſity and precipitation, that three conſiderable battles
                    were fought in the ſpace of three days. One near Placentia, another near
                    Cremona, and a third at a place called <hi rend="italic">Caſtor ;</hi> in all
                    which Otho had the advantage. But theſe ſucceſſes were but of ſhort-lived
                    continuance ; for Valens and Cecina, who had hitherto acted ſeparately, joining
                    their forces, and reinforcing their armies with freſh ſupplies, reſolved to come
                    to a general engagement. Otho, who by this time had joined his army at a little
                    village called <hi rend="italic">Bedtàacum,</hi> finding the enemy,
                    notwithſtanding their late loſſes, inclined to come to a battle, reſolved to
                    call a council of war to determine upon the proper meaſures to be taken. His
                    generals were of opinion to protract the war ; but others, whoſe inexperience
                    had given them conſidence, declared, that nothing but a battle could relieve the
                    miſeries of the ſtate ; proteſting, that Fortune, and all the gods, with the
                    divinity of the emperor himſelf, favoured the deſign, and would undoubtedly
                    proſper the enterpriſe.</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0420" facs="gri_33125011196389_0426.tif"/>
                <p>Tn this advice Otho acquieſced : he had been for ſome time ſo uneaſy under the
                    war, that he ſeemed willing to exchange ſuſpenſe ſor danger. However, he was fo
                    ſurrounded with flatterers, that he was prohibited from being perſonally preſent
                    in the engagement, but prevailed upon to reſerve himſelf ſor the fortune of the
                    empire, and wait the event at Brixellum. The affairs of both armies being thus
                    adjuſted, they came to an engagement at Bedriacum ; where, in the beginning,
                    thoſe on the ſide of Otho ſeemed to have the advantage. At length, the ſuperior
                    discipline of the legions of Vitellius turned the ſcale of victory. Otho’s army
                    fled in great confuſion towards Bedriacum, being purſued with a miſerable
                    ſlaughter all the way.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, Otho waited for the news of the battle with great impatience,
                    and ſeemed to tax his meſſengers with delay. The firſt account of his defeat was
                    brought him by a common ſoldier, who had eſcaped from the field of battle.
                    However, Otho, who was ſtill ſurrounded by flatterers, was deſired to give no
                    credit to a baſe fugitive, who was guilty of falſehood only to cover his own
                    cowardice. The ſoldier, however, ſtill perſiſted in the veracity of his report ;
                    and, finding none inclined to believe him, immediately ſell upon his ſword, and
                    expired at the emperor’s feet. Otho was ſo much ſtruck with the death of this
                    man, that he cried out, that he would cauſe the ruin of no more ſuch valiant and
                    worthy ſoldiers, but would end the conteſt the ſhorteſt way ; and therefore
                    having exhorted his followers to ſubmit to’Vitellius, he put an end to his own
                    liſe.</p>
                <p>It was no ſooner known that Otho had killed himſelf, than all the ſoldiers
                    repaired to Virginius, the commander of the German legions, earneſtly intreating
                    him to take upon him the reins of government ; or at leaſt, intredting his
                    mediation with the generals of Vitellius in their favour. Upon his declining
                    their requeſt, Rubrius Gallus, a perſon of conſiderable note, undertook their
                    embaſſy to the generals of the conquering army ; and ſoon after obtained a
                    pardon for all the adherents of Otho.</p>
                <p>Vitellius was immediately after declared emperor by the ſenate ; and received
                    the marks of diſtinction which were now accuſtomed to follow the appointment of
                    the ſtrongeſt ſide. At the ſame time, Italy was ſeverely diſtreſſed by the
                    ſoldiers, who committed ſuch outrages as exceeded all the oppreſſions of the
                    moſt calamitous war. Vitellius, who was yet in Gaul, reſolved, before hc ſet out
                    for Rome, to puniſh the prætorian cohorts, who had been the inſtruments of all
                    the late diſturbances in the ſtate. He therefore cauſed them to be diſarmed, and
                    deprived of the name and honour of ſoldiers. He alſo ordered 150 of thoſe who
                    were moſt guilty to be put to death.</p>
                <p>As he approached towards Rome, he paſſed through the towns with all imaginable
                    ſplendor ; his paſſage by water was in painted galleys, adorned with garlands of
                    flowers, and profuſely furniſhed with the greateſt delicacies. In his journey
                    there was neither order nor diſcipline among his ſoldiers; they plundered
                    wherever they came with impunity ; and he ſeemed no way diſpleaſed with the
                    licentiouſneſs of their behaviour.</p>
                <p>Upon his arrival at Rome, he entered the city, not as a place he came to govern
                    with juſtice, but as a town that became his own by the laws of conqueſt. He</p>
                <p>marched through the ſtreets mounted on horſeback, all in armour ; the ſenate and
                    people going before him, as if the captives of his late victory. He the next day
                    made the ſenate a ſpeech, in which he magnified his own actions, and promiſed
                    them extraordinary advantages from his adminiſtration. He then harangued the
                    people, who, being now long accuſtomed to flatter all in authority, highly
                    applauded and bleſſed their new emperor.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, his ſoldiers being permitted to ſa-tiate themſelves in the
                    debaucheries of the city, grew totally unfit for war. The principal affairs of
                    the ſtate were managed by the loweſt wretches. Vitellius, more abandoned than
                    they, gave himſelf up to all kinds of luxury and profiiſeneſs : but gluttony was
                    his favourite vice, ſo that he brought himſelf to a habit of vomiting, in order
                    to renew his meals at pleaſure. His entertainments, though ſeldom at his own
                    coſt, were prodigiouſly expenſive ; he frequently invited himſelf to the tables
                    of his ſubjects, breakfaſting with one, dining with another, and ſupping with a
                    third, all in the ſame day. The moſt memorable of theſe entertainments was that
                    made for him by his brother on his arrival at Rome. In this were ſerved up 2000
                    ſeveral diſhes of ſiſh, and 70cc of fowl, of the moſt valuable kinds. But in one
                    particular diſh he ſeemed to have outdone all the former profuſion of the moſt
                    luxurious Romans. This diſh, which was of ſuch magnitude as to be called, the <hi rend="italic">jldeld of Minerva,</hi> was filled with an olio made
                    ſrom the founds of the fiſh called <hi rend="italic">ſcarri,</hi> the brains
                    of phea-ſants and woodcocks, the tongues of the moſt coſtly birds, and the ſpawn
                    of lampreys brought from the Carpathian ſea. In order to cook this diſh
                    properly, a furnace was built in the fields, as it was too large for any kitchen
                    to contain it.</p>
                <p>In this manner did Vitellius proceed ; ſo that Joſe-phus tells us, if he had
                    reigned long, the whole empire would not have been ſufficient to have maintained
                    his gluttony. All the attendants of his court ſought to raiſe themſelves, not by
                    their virtues and abilities, but the ſumptuouſneſs of their entertainments. This
                    prodigality produced its attendant, want; and that, in turn,, gave riſe to
                    cruelty.</p>
                <p>Thoſe who had formerly been his aſſociates were now deſtroyed without mercy.
                    Going to viſit one of them in a violent fever, he mingled poiſon with his water,
                    and delivered it to him with his own hands. He never pardoned thoſe
                    money-lenders who came to demand payment of his former debts. One of the number
                    coming to ſalute him, he immediately ordered him to be carried off to execution
                    ; but ſhortly after, commanding him to be brought back, when all his
                    attend--ants thought it was to pardon the unhappy creditor, Vitellius gave them
                    ſoon to underſtood that it was merely to have the pleaſure of feeding his eyes
                    with: his torments. Having condemned another to death,, he executed his two ſons
                    with him, only for their preſuming to intercede for their father. A Roman knight
                    being dragged away to execution, and crying out that he had made the emperor his
                    heir, Vitellius demanded to ſee the will, where finding himſelf joint heir with
                    another, he ordered both to be executed, that he might enjoy the legacy without
                    a partner.</p>
                <p>By the continuance of ſuch vices and cruelties as theſe he became odious to all
                    mankind, and the aſtro∙</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0421" facs="gri_33125011196389_0427.tif"/>
                <p>togers began to prognoſticate his ruin. A writing was ſet up in the forum to
                    this effect : “ We, in the name of the ancient Chaldeans, give Vitellius warning
                    to depart this life by the kalends of October.” Vitellius, on his part, received
                    this information with terror, and ordered all the aſtrologers to be baniſhed
                    from Rome. An old woman having foretold, that if he ſurvived his mother, he
                    ſhould reign many years in happineſs and ſecurity, this gave him a deſire of
                    putting her to death ; which he did, by refuſing her ſuſtenance, under the
                    pretence of its being prejudicial to her health. But he ſoon ſaw the futility of
                    relying upon ſuch vain prognoſtications ; for his ſoldiers, by their cruelty and
                    rapine, having become inſupportable to the inhabitants of Rome, the legions of
                    the Eaſt, who had at firſt acquieſced in his dominion, began to revolt, and
                    ſhortly after unanimouſiy reſolved to make Veſpalian emperor.</p>
                <p>Veſpaſian, who was appointed commander againſt the rebellious Jews, had reduced
                    moſt of their country, except Jeruſalem, to ſubjection. The death of Nero,
                    however, had at firſt interrupted the progreſs of his arms, and the ſucceſſion
                    of Galba gave a temporary check to his conqueſts, as he was obliged to ſend his
                    ſon Titus to Rome, to receive that emperor’s commands. Titus, however, was ſo
                    long detained by contrary winds, that he received news of Galba’s death before
                    he ſet ſail. He then reſolved to continue neuter during the civil wars between
                    Otho and Vitellius ; and when the latter prevailed, he gave him his homage with
                    reluctance. But being deſirous of acquiring reputation, though he diſliked the
                    government, he determined to lay liege to Jeruſalem, and actually made
                    preparations for that great undertaking, when he was given to underſtand that
                    Vitellius was deteſted by all ranks in the empire. Theſe murmurings increaſed
                    every day, while Veſpaſian ſecretly endeavoured to advance the diſcontents of
                    the army. By theſe means they began at length to fix their eyes upon him as the
                    perſon the moſt capable and willing to terminate the miſeries of his country,
                    and put a period to. the injuries it ſuffered. Not only the legions under his
                    command, but thoſe in Mæfia and Pannonia, came to the ſame reſolution, ſo that
                    they declared themſelves for Veſpaſian. He was alſo without his own conſent
                    proclaimed emperor at Alexandria, the army there confirming it with
                    extraordinary applauſe, and paying their accuſtomed homage. Still, however,
                    Veſpaſian ſeemed to decline the honour done him ; till at length his ſoldiers
                    compelled him, with their threats of immediate death, to accept a title which,
                    in all probability, he wiſhed to enjoy. He now, therefore, called a council of
                    war : where it was reſolved, that his ſon Titus ſhould carry on the war againſt
                    the Jews ; and that Mutianus, one of his generals, ſhould, with the greateſt
                    part of his legions, enter Italy ; while Veſpaſian himſelf ſhould levy forces in
                    all parts of the eaſt, in order to reinforce them in caſe of neceſſity.</p>
                <p>During theſe preparations, Vitelliu3, though buried in ſloth and luxury, was
                    reſolved to make an effort to defend the empire ; wherefore his chief
                    commanders, Valens and Cecina, were ordered to make all poſſible preparations to
                    reſiſt the invaders. The firſt army that entered Italy with an hoſtile intention
                    was under the command of Antonius Primus, who was met by Ce-cina near Cremona. A
                    battle was expected to enſue j but a negociation taking place, Cecina was
                    prevailed upon to change ſides, and declare for Veſpaſian. His army, however,
                    quickly repented of what they had done ; and' impriſoning their general,
                    attacked Antonius, though without a leader. The engagement con-’ tinued during
                    the whole night : in the morning, after <hi rend="italic">a <hi rend="sup">,</hi></hi> ſhort repaſt, both armies engaged a ſecond time ; when the ſoldiers of
                    Antonius ſaluting the riſing ſun, according to cuſtom, the Vitellians ſuppoſing
                    that they had received new reinforcements, betook themſelves to flight, with the
                    loſs of 30,0c0 men. Shortly after, freeing their general Cecina from priſon,
                    they prevailed upon him to intercede with the conquerors for pardon ; which they
                    obtained, though not without the moſt horrid barbarities committed upon Cremona,
                    the city to which they had retired for ſhelter.</p>
                <p>When Vitellius was informed of the defeat of his army, his former inſolence was
                    converted into an extreme of timidity and irreſolution. At length he commanded
                    Julius Priſcus and Alphenus Varus, with ſome forces that were in readineſs, to
                    guard the paſſes of the Apennines, to prevent the enemy’s march to Rome ;
                    reſerving the principal body of his army to ſecure the city, under the command
                    of his brother Lucius. But being perfoaded to repair to his army in perſon, his
                    preſence only ſerved to increaſe the contempt of his ſoldiers. He there appeared
                    irreſolute* and ſtill luxurious, without counſel or conduct, ignorant of war,
                    and demanding from others thoſe iιi-ſtructions which ſt was his duty to give.
                    After a ſhort continuance in the camp, and' underſtanding the revolt of his
                    fleet, he returned once more to Rome : but every day only ſerved to render his
                    affairs ſtill more deſperate ; till at laſt he made offers to Veſpaſian of
                    reſigning the empire, provided his life were granted, and a ſufficient revenue
                    for his ſnpport. In order to enforce his requeſt, he iſſued from his palace in
                    deep mourning, with all his domeſtics weeping round him. He then went to offer
                    the ſword of juſtice to Cecilius,, the conſul which he refuſing, the abject
                    emperor prepared to lay down the enſigns of the empire in the temple of Concord.
                    But being interrrupted by ſome, who cried out, That he himſelf was Concord <hi
                        rend="sub"> r</hi> he reſolved, upon ſo weak an encouragement, ſtill to
                    maintain his power, and immediately prepared for his defence.</p>
                <p>During this fluctuation of counſels, one Sabinus, who had adviſed Vitellius to
                    reſign, perceiving his deſperate ſituation, reſolved, by a bold ſtep, to oblige
                    Veſpaſian, and accordingly ſeized upon the Capitol. But he was premature in his
                    attempt ; for the ſoldiers of Vitellius attacked him with great fury, and,
                    prevailing by their numbers, ſoon laid that beautiful building in aſhes. During
                    this dreadful conflagration, Vitellius was feaſting in the palace of Tiberius,
                    and beholding all the horrors of the aſſault with great ſatisfaction. Sabinus
                    was taken priſoner, and ſhortly after executed by the emperor’s command. Young
                    Domitian,, his nephew, who was afterwards emperor, eſcaped by flight, in the
                    habit of a prieſt ; and all the reſt who ſurvived the fire were put to the
                    ſword.</p>
                <p>But this ſucceſs ſerved little to improve the affairs of Vitellius. He vainly
                    lent meſſenger after meſſenger to. bring Veſpaiian’s general, Antonius, to a
                    compoſition»,</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0422" facs="gri_33125011196389_0428.tif"/>
                <p>This commander gave no anſwer to his requeſts, but ſtill continued his march
                    towards Rome. Being arrived before the walls of thé city, the forces of
                    Vitellius were reſolved upon defending it to the utmoſt extremity. It was
                    attacked on three ſides with the utmoſt fury ; while the army within, ſally ing
                    upon the beſiegers, defended it with equal obſtinacy. The battle laſted a whole
                    day, till at laſt the beſieged were driven into the city, and a dreadful
                    ſtaughter made of them in all the ſtreets, which they vainly attempted to
                    defend. In the mean time, the citizens ſtood by, looking on as 'both ſides
                    fought ; and, as if they had been in a theatre, clapped their hands ; at one
                    time encouraging one party, and again the other. As either turned their backs,
                    the citizens would then fall upon them in their places of refuge, and ſo kill
                    and plunder them without mercy. But what was ſtill more remarkable, during theſe
                    dreadful ſlaughters both within and without the city, the people would not be
                    prevented from celebrating one of their riotous feaſts, called the <hi
                        rend="italic"> Saturnalia ;</hi> ſo that at one time might have been ſeen a
                    ſtrange mixture of mirth and miſery, of cruelty and lewdneſs ; in one place,
                    buryings and ſlaughters ; in another, drunkenneſs and feaſting ; in a word, all
                    the horrors of a civil war, and all the licentiouſneſs of the moſt abandoned
                    ſecurity !</p>
                <p>During this complicated ſcene of miſery, Vitellius retired privately to his
                    wife’s houſe, upon mount Aventine, deſigning that night to fly to the army
                    commanded by his brother at Tarracina. But, quite incapable, through fear, of
                    forming any reſolution, he changed his mind, and returned again to his palace,
                    now void and deſolate ; all his ſlaves forſaking him in his diſtreſs, and
                    purpoſely avoiding his preſence. There, after wandering for ſome time quite
                    diſconſolate, and fearing the face of every creature he met, he hid himſelf in
                    an obſcure corner, from whence he was ſoon taken by a party of the conquering
                    ſoldiers. Still, however, wailing to add a few hours more to his miſerable life,
                    he begged to be kept in priſon till the arrival of •Ve.ſpaſian at Rome,
                    pretending that he had ſecrets of importance to diſcover. But his intreaties
                    were vain : the ſoldiers binding his hands behind him, and throwing an halter
                    round his neck, led him along, half naked, into the public forum, upbraiding
                    him, as they proceeded, with all thoſe bitter reproaches their malice could
                    ſuggeſt, or his own cruelties deſerve. They jallb tied his hair backwards, as
                    was uſual with the moſt infamous malefactors, and held the point of a ſword
                    under his chin, to prevent his hiding his face from the public. Some caſt dirt
                    and filth upon him as he paſſed, others ſtruck him with their hands ; ſome
                    ridiculed the defects of his perſon, his red fiery face, and the e-mormous
                    greatneſs of his belly. At length, being come to the place of puniſhment, they
                    killed him with many blows ; and then dragging the dead body through the ſtreets
                    with an hook, they threw it, with all poſſible ignominy, into the river Tiber.
                    Such was the miſerable</p>
                <p>end of this emperor, in the 57th year of his age, after a ſhort reign of eight
                    months and five days.</p>
                <p>Vitellius being dead, the conquering army purſued their enemies throughout the
                    city, while neither houſes nor temples afforded refuge to the fugitives. The
                    ſtieets and public places were all ſtrewed with dead, each man lying ſlain where
                    it was his misfortune to be</p>
                <p>overtaken by his unmerciful purſuers. But not only the enemy ſuffered in this
                    manner, but many of the citizens, who were obnoxious to the ſoldiers, were
                    dragged from their houſes, and killed without any form of trial. The heat of
                    their reſentment being ſomewhat abated, they next began to ſeek for plunder ;
                    and under pretence of ſearching ſor the enemy, left no place without marks of
                    their rage or rapacity. Beſides the ſoldiers, the lower rabble joined in theſe
                    deteſtable outrages ; ſome ſlaves came and diſcovered the riches of their
                    maſters ; ſome were detected by their neareſt friends ; the whole city was
                    filled with outcry and lamentation ; inſomuch, that the former ravages of Otho
                    and Vitellius were now conſidered as flight evils in compariſon.</p>
                <p>At length, however, upon the arrival of Mutianus, general to Veſpaſian, theſe
                    ſlaughters ceaſed, and the ſtate began to wear the appearance of former
                    tranquillity. Veſpaſian was declared emperor by the unanimous conſent both of
                    the ſenate and the army ; and dignified with all thoſe titles, which now
                    followed rather the power than the merit of thoſe who were appointed to govern.
                    Meſſengers were diſpatched to him into Egypt, deſiring his return, and
                    teſtifying the utmoſt deſire for his government. However, the winter being
                    dangerous for failing, he deferred his voyage to a more convenient ſeaſon.
                    Perhaps, alſo, the diſſenſions in other parts of the empire retarded his return
                    to Rome ; for one Claudius Civilis, in Lower Germany, excited his countrymen to
                    revolt, and deſtroyed the Roman garriſons, which were placed in different parts
                    of that province. But, to give his rebellion an air of juſtice, he cauſed his
                    army to ſwear allegiance to Veſpaſian, until he found himſelf in a condition to
                    throw off the maik. When he thought himſelf ſufficiently powerſul, he diſclaimed
                    all ſubmiſſion to the Roman government ; and having overcome one or two of the
                    lieutenants of the empire, and being joined by ſuch of the Romans as refuſed
                    obedience to the new emperor, he boldly advanced to give Cerealis, Veſpaſi-an’s
                    general, battle. In the beginning of this engagement, he ſeemed ſucceſsful,
                    breaking the Roman legions, and putting their cavalry to flight. But at length
                    Cerealis by his conduct turned the fate of the day, and not only routed the
                    enemy, but took and deſtroyed their camp. This engagement, however, was not
                    deciſive ; ſeveral others enſued with doubtful ſucceſs. An accommodation at
                    length took place. Civilis obtained peace for his countιymen, and pardon for
                    himſelf ; for the Roman empire was, at this time, ſo torn by its own diviſions,
                    that the barbarous nations around made incurſions with impunity, and were ſure
                    of obtaining peace whenever they thought proper to demand it.</p>
                <p>During the time of theſe commotions in Germany, the Sarmatians, a barbarous
                    nation in the north-eaſt of the empire, ſuddenly paſſed the river Iſer, and
                    marched into the Roman dominions with ſuch celerity and fury, as to deſtroy
                    ſeveral garriſons, and an army under the command of Eonteius Agrippa. However,
                    they were driven back by Rubrius Gallus, Veſpaſian’s lieutenant, into their
                    native ſoreſts; where ſeveral -attempts were made to confine them by garriſons
                    and forts, placed along the confines of their country. But theſe hardy nations,
                    having once found the way into the empire,</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0423" facs="gri_33125011196389_0429.tif"/>
                <p>never after deſiſted from invading it upon every opportunity, till at length
                    they over-ran and deſtroyed it entirely.</p>
                <p>Veſpaſian continued ſome months at Alexandria in Egypt, where it is ſaid he
                    cured a blind and a lame man by touching them. Before he ſet out for Rome, he
                    gave his ſon Titus the command of the army that was to lay ſiege to Jeruſalem ;
                    while he himſelſ went forward, and was met many miles from Rome by all the
                    ſenate, and near half the inhabitants, who gave the ſincereſt teſtimonies of
                    their joy, in having an emperor of ſuch great and experienced virtues. Nor did
                    he in the leaſt diſappoint their expectations; being equally aſſiduous in
                    rewarding merit, and pardoning his adverſaries ; in reforming the manners of the
                    citizens, and ſetting them the beſt example in his own.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, Titus carried on the war againſt the Jews with vigour, which
                    ended in the terrible deſtruction of the city, mentioned under the article Jews.
                    After which his ſoldiers would have crowned Titus as conqueror ; but he refuſed
                    the honour, alleging that he was only an inſtrument in the hand of Heaven, that
                    manifeſtly declared its wrath againſt the Jews. At Rome, however, all mouths
                    were filled with the praiſes of the conqueror, who had not only ſhowed himſelf
                    an excellent general, but a courageous combatant : his return, therefore,, in
                    triumph, which he did with his father, was marked with all the magnificence and
                    joy that was in the power of men to expreſs. All things that were eſteemed
                    valuable or beautiful among men were brought to adorn this great occaſion. Among
                    the rich ſpoils were expoſed vaſt quantities of gold taken out of the temple ;
                    but the book of their law was not the feaſt remarkable amongſt the magnificent
                    profuſion. A triumphal arch was erected upon this occaſion, on which were
                    deſcribed all the victories of Titus over the Jews, which remains almoſt entire
                    to this very day. Veſpaſian likewiſe built a temple to Peace, wherein were
                    depoſited moſt of the Jewiſh ſpoils ; and having now calmed all the commotions
                    in every part of the empire, he ſhut up the temple of Janus, which had been open
                    about five or ſix years.</p>
                <p>Veſpaſian having thus given ſecurity and peace to the empire, reſolved to
                    correct numberleſs abuſes which had grown up under the tyranny of his
                    predeceſtbrs. To effect this with greater eaſe, he joined Titus with him in the
                    conſulſhip and tribunitial power, and in ſome meaſure admitted him a partner in
                    all the higheſt offices of the ſtate. He began with reſtraining the
                    licentiouſneſs of the army, and forcing them back to their priſtine diſcipline.
                    He abridged the proceſſes that had been carried to an unreaſonable length in the
                    courts of juſtice. He took care to rebuild ſuch parts of the city as had
                    ſuffered in the late commotions ; particularly the Capitol, which had been
                    lately burnt ; and which he now reſtored to more than former magnificence. He
                    likewiſe built a famous amphitheatre, the ruins of which are to this day an
                    evidence of its ancient grandeur. The other ruinous cities of the empire alſo
                    ſhared his paternal care ; he improved ſuch as were declining, adorned others,
                    and built many anew. In ſuch acts as theſe he paſſed a long reign of clemency
                    and moderation ; ſo that it is ſaid, no man ſuffered by an unjuſt or a ſevere
                    decree during his adminiſtration.</p>
                <p>Julius Sabinus ſeem§ to be the only perſon who was treated with greater rigour
                    than was uſual with this emperor, &gt;Sabinus was commander of a ſmall army
                    in Gaul, and had declared himſelf emperor upon the death of Vitellius. However,
                    his army was ſhortly after overcome by Veſpaſian’s general, and he himſelf
                    compelled to ſeek ſafety by flight. He for ſome time wandered through the Roman
                    provinces, without being diſcovered: but finding the purſuit every day become
                    cloſer, he was obliged to hide himſelf in a cave ; in which hs remained
                    concealed for no leſs than nine years, attended all the time by his ſaithful
                    wife Empona, who provided proviſions for hi.a by day, and repaired to him by
                    night. However, ſhe was at laſt diſcovered in the performance of this
                    pious.office, and Sabinus was taken priſoner and carried to Rome. Great
                    interceſſion was made to the emperor in his behalf : Empona herſelf appearing
                    with her two children, and imploring her huſ-band’s pardon. However, neither her
                    tears nor intrea-ties could prevail ; Sabinus had been too dangerous a rival for
                    mercy ſo that, though ſhe and her children were ſpared, her huſhand ſuffered by
                    the executioner.</p>
                <p>But this ſeems to be the only inſtance in which he reſented paſt offences. He
                    cauſed the daughter of Vitellius, his avowed enemy, to be married into a noble
                    family, and he himſelf provided her a ſuitable fortune. One of Nero’s ſervants
                    coming to beg ſor pardon for having once rudely thruſt him out of the palace,
                    and inſulted him when in office, Veſpaſian only took his revenge by ſerving him
                    juſt in the ſame manner. When any plots or conſpiracies were formed againſt him,
                    he diſdained to puniſh the guilty, ſaying, That they de-ferved rather his
                    contempt for their ignorance, than his reſentment ; as they ſeemed to envy him a
                    dignity of which he daily experienced the uneaſineſs. His liberality towards the
                    encouragement of arts and learning, was not leſs than his clemency. He ſettled a
                    conſtant ſalary of 100,000 ſeſterces upon the teachers of rhetoric. He was
                    particularly favourable to Joſephus, the Jewiſh hiſtorian. Quintilian the
                    orator, and Pliny the naturaliſt, flouriſhed in his reign, and were highly
                    eſteemed by him. He was no leſs an encourager of all other excellencies in art ;
                    and invited the greateſt maſters and artificers from all parts of the world,
                    making them conſiderable preſents, as he found occaſion.</p>
                <p>Yet all his numerous acts of generoſity and magnificence could not preſerve his
                    character from the imputation of rapacity and avarice. He revived many obſo-lete
                    methods of taxation ; and even bought and ſold commodities himſelf, in order to
                    increaſe his fortune» He is charged with advancing the moſt avaricious governors
                    to the provinces, in order to ſhare their plunder on their return to Rome. He
                    deſeended to ſome very unuſual and diſhonourable impoſts, even to the laying a
                    tax upon urine. When his ſon Titus remonſtrated againſt the meanneſs of ſuch a
                    tax, Veſpaſian taking a piece of money, demanded if the ſmell offended him ; and
                    then added, that this very money was produced by urine. Butin excuſe for. this,
                    we muſt obſerve, that the exchequer, when Veſpaſian came to the throne,, was ſo
                    much exhauſted, that he informed the ſenate that it would require a ſupply of
                    three hundred millions (of our money) to re-eſtabliſh the commonwealth» This
                    neceſſity muſt naturally produce more numerous and heavy taxations than the
                    empire had hitherto expe* rienced ; but while the provinces were thus obliged to</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0424" facs="gri_33125011196389_0430.tif"/>
                <p>contribute to the ſupport of his power, he took every precaution to provide for
                    their ſafety ; ſo that we find but two inſurrections in this reign.—In the
                    fourth year of his reign, Antiochus king of Comagena, holding a private
                    correſpondence with the Parthians. the declared enemies of Rome, was taken
                    priſoner in Cilicia, by Pyrrhus the governor, and font bound to Rome. But
                    Veſpaſian generouſly prevented all ill treatment, by giving him a reſidence at
                    Lacedæmon, and allowing him a revenue ſuitable to his dignity. About the ſame
                    time alſo, the Alani, a barbarous people inhabiting along the river Tanais,
                    abandoned their barren wilds, and invaded the kingdom of Media. From thence
                    paſſing into Armenia, after great ravages, they overthrew Tiridates, the king of
                    that country, with prodigious ſlaughter. Titus was at length ſeitt to chaſtiſe
                    their inſolence : but the barbarians retired at the approach of the Roman army,
                    loaded with plunder ; being compelled to wait a more favourable opportunity of
                    renewing their irruptions. Theſe incurſions, however, were but a tranſient
                    ſtorm, the effects of which were ſoon repaired by the emperor’s moderation and
                    aſſiduity. We are told, that he now formed and eſtabliſhed a thouſand nations,
                    which had ſcarcely before amounted to <hi rend="italic">too.</hi> No provinces
                    in the</p>
                <p>empire lay out of his view and protection» He had, during his whole reign, a
                    particular regard to Britain ; his generals, Petilius Cerealis, and Julius
                    Frontinus, brought the greateſt part of the iſland into ſubjection ; and
                    Agricola, who ſucceeded ſoon after, completed what they had begun. See England.</p>
                <p>In this manner, having reigned io years, loved by his ſubjects, and deſerving
                    their affection, he was ſurpriſed by an indiſpoſition at Campania, which he at
                    once declared would be fatal, crying out, in the ſpirit of Paganiſm, “ Methinks
                    I am going to be a god.” Removing from thence to the city, and afterwards to a
                    country-ſeat near Reate, he was there taken with a flux, which brought him to
                    the laſt extremity. However, perceiving his end approach, and juſt going to
                    expire, he cried out, that an emperor ought to die ſtanding ; •wherefore,
                    raiſing himſelf upon his feet, he expired in the hands of thoſe that ſuſtained
                    him.</p>
                <p>Titus being joyfully received as emperor, notwithſtanding a flight oppoſition
                    from his brother Domitian, who maintained that he himſelf was appointed, and
                    that Titus had falſified the will, began his reign with every virtue that became
                    an emperor and a man. During the liſe of his ſather there had been many
                    imputations againſt him ; but upon his exaltation to the throne he ſeemed
                    entirely to take leave of his former vices, and became an.example of the
                    greateſt moderation and humanity. He had long loved Berenice, ſiſter to Agrippa
                    king of Judea, a woman of the greateſt beauty and allurements. But knowing that
                    the connection with her was entirely diſagreeable to the people of Rome, he ſent
                    her away, notwithſtanding their mutual paſſion and the many arts ſhe uſed to
                    induce him to change his reſolutions. He next diſcarded all thoſe who had been
                    the former miniſters of his pleaſures, and forbore to coιa <hi rend="sup">ι</hi> tenance the companions of his looſer recreations, though he had formerly
                    taken great pains in the ſelec-tion. This moderation, added to his juſtice and
                    gene-τofity, procured him tne love of all good men, and the appellation of the <hi rend="italic">delight of mankind,</hi> which all his ac</p>
                <p>tions ſeemed calculated to enſure. As he came to the throne with all the
                    advantages of his father’s popularity, he was reſolved to uſe every method to
                    increaſe it. He therefore took particular care to puniſh all informers, falſe
                    witneſſes, and promoters of diſſenſion, condemning them to be ſcourged in the
                    moſt public ſtreets, next to be dragged through the theatre, and then to be
                    baniſhed to the uninhabited parts of the empire, and ſold as ſlaves. His
                    courteſy and readineſs to do good have been celebrated even by Chriſtian writers
                    ; his principal rule being, never to ſend any petitioner diſſatisſied away. One
                    night, recollecting that he had done nothing beneficial to mankind the day
                    preceding, he cried out among his friends, “ I have loſt a day.” A ſentence too
                    remarkable not to be univerſally known.</p>
                <p>In this reign, an eruption of mount Vefuvius did conſiderable damage,
                    overwhelming many towns, and ſending its aſhes into countries more than 100
                    miles diſtant. Upon this memorable occaſion, Pliny the naturaliſt loſt his life
                    ; for, being impelled by too eager a curioſity to obſerve the eruption, he was
                    ſuffocated in the flames<note anchored="true" place="margin" type="suthorial"
                        >See <hi rend="italic">Vesuvias.</hi></note>. There happened alſo about this
                    time a fire at Rome, which continued three days and nights ſucceſſively, which
                    was followed by a plague, in which 10,0 O men were buried in a day. The emperor,
                    how· ever, did all that lay in his power to repair the damage ſuſtained by the
                    public ; and, with reſpect to the city, declared that he would take the whole
                    loſs of it upon himſelf. Theſe diſaſters were in ſome meaſure counterbalanced by
                    the ſucceſſes in Britain, under Agricola. This excellent general having been
                    ſent into that country towards the latter end of Veſpaſian’s reign, ſhowed
                    himſelf equally expert in quelling the refractory, and civilizing thoſe who had
                    formerly ſubmitted to the Roman power. The Ordovices, or inhabitants of North
                    Wales, were the firſt that were ſubdued. He then made a deſcent upon Mona, or
                    the iſland of Angleſea ; which ſurrendered at diſcretion. Having thus rendered
                    himſelf maſter of the whole country, he took every method to reſtore diſcipline
                    to his own army, and to introduce ſome ſhare of politeneſs among thoſe whom he
                    had conquered. He exhorted them, both by advice and example, to build temples,
                    theatres, and ſtately houſes. He cauſed the ſons of their nobility to be
                    inſtructed in the liberal arts ; he had them taught the Latin language, and
                    induced them to imitate the Roman modes of dreſſing and living. Thus, by
                    degrees, this barbarous people began to aſſume the luxurious manners of their
                    conquerors, and in time even outdid them in all the refinements of ſenſual
                    pleaſure. For the ſucceſs in Britain, Titus was ſaluted emperor the j 5th time ;
                    but he did not long ſurvive his honours, being ſeized with a violent fever at a
                    little diſtance from Rome. Perceiving his death to approach, he declared, that
                    during the whole courſe of his liſe he knew but of one action which he repented
                    of ; but that action he did not think proper to expreſs. Shortly after, he died
                    (not without ſuſpicion of treachery from his brother Domitian, who had long
                    wiſhed to govern) in the 41 ſt year of his age, having reigned two years two
                    months and twenty days.</p>
                <p>The love which ail ranks of people bore to Tituà, facilitated the election of
                    his brother Domitian, notwithſtanding the ill opinion many had already conceived
                    of him. Hie ambition was already but too well</p>

                <p>known, and his pride ſoon appeared ιipon hiâ coming to the throne ; having been
                    heard to declare, that he had given the empire to his father ànd brother, and
                    now received it again as his due.</p>
                <p>The begirtnirtg of his reign wàs univerſally acceptable to the people, as he
                    appeared equally remarkable far his clemency, liberality, and juſtice. He
                    carried his abhorrence of cruelty ſo far, as at one time to forbid the
                    ſacriſicing of exert. His liberality was ſuch, •that he would not accept of the
                    legacies that were left ſhim by ſuch as had children of their own. His juſtice
                    was ſuch, that he would fit whole days and reverſe the partial ſentertces of the
                    ordinary judges. He appeared very carefrtl artd liberal in repairing the
                    libraries which had been burnt, and recovering copies of ſuch books as had been
                    loſt, ſending on purpoſe to Alexandria to tranſcribe them. But he ſoon began to
                    ſhow the natural deformity of his mind. Inſtead of cultivating literature, as
                    his father and brother had done, he neglected ail kinds of ſtudy, addicting
                    himſelf wholly to the meaner purfuits,-particularly archery and gaming. No
                    emperor before him entertained the people with ſuch various and expenſive ſhows.
                    During theſe diverſions he diſtributed great rewards ; ſitting as preſident
                    himſelf, adorned with a purple robe and crown, with the prieſts of Jupiter and
                    the college of Flavian prieſts about him. The meanneſs of his occupations in
                    ſolitude were a juſt contraſt to his exhibitions in public oſtentation. He
                    uſually ſpent his hours of retirement in catching flies, and flicking them
                    through with a bodkin ; ſo that one of his ſervants being aſked if the emperor
                    was alone, he anſwered, that he had not ſo much as a fly to bear him company.
                    His vices ſeemed every day to increaſe with the duration of his reign ; and as
                    he thus became more odious to his people, all their murmurs only ſerved to add
                    ſtrength to his ſuſpicions, and malice to his cruelty. His ungrateful treatment
                    of Agricola ſeemed</p>
                <p>the firſt ſymptom of his natural malevolence. Domitian . was always particularly
                    fond of obtaining a military reputation, and therefore jealous of it in others.
                    He had marched ſome time before into Gaul, upon a pretended expedition againſt
                    the Catti, a people of Germany ; and, without ever ſeeing the enemy, reſolved to
                    have the honour of a triumph upon his return to Rome. For that purpoſe he
                    purchaſed a number of ſlaves, whom he dreſſed in German habits ; and at the head
                    of this miſerable proceſſion entered the city, amidſt the apparent acclamations
                    and concealed contempt of all his ſubjects. The ſucceſſes, therefore, of
                    Agricola in Britain affected him with an extreme degree of envy. This admirable
                    general, who is ſcarce mentioned by any writer except Tacitus, purſued the
                    advantages which he had already obtained. He routed the Caledonians ; overcame
                    Galgacus, the Britiſh chief, at the head of 30,000 men ; and afterwards ſending
                    out a fleet to ſcour the coaſt, firſt diſcovered Great Britain tobe an
                        iſland<note anchored="true" place="margin" type="suthorial">See <hi
                            rend="italic">Scotland.</hi></note>. He likewiſe diſcovered and ſubdued
                    the Orkneys, and thus reduced the whole into a civilized province of the Roman
                    empire. When the account of theſe ſucceſſes was brought to Domitian, he received
                    it with a ſeeming pleaſure, but real uneaſineſs. He thought Agricola’s -riling
                    reputation a reproach upon his own inactivity ; and, inſtead of attempting to
                    emulate, he reſolved to ſuppreſs the merit of his ſervices. He ordered him,
                    therefore, the external marks of his approbation, and took care that triumphant
                    ornaments, ſtatues, and other honours, ſhould be decreed him ; but at the ſame
                    time he removed him from his command, under a pretence of appointing him to the
                    government of Syria. By theſe means, Agricola ſurrendered up his government to
                    Saluſtius Lucullus, but ſoon found that Syria was other* wiſe diſpoſed of. Upon
                    his return to Rome, which was privately and by night, he was coolly received by
                    the emperor ; and dying ſome time after in retirement, it was ſuppoſed by ſome
                    that his end was haſtened by Domitian’s direction.</p>
                <p>Domitian ſoon after found the want of ſo experienced a commander in the many
                    irruptions of the barbarous nations that ſurrounded the empire. The Sarmatians
                    in Europe, joined with thoſe in Aſia, made a formidable invaſion ; at once
                    deſtroying a whole legion, and a general of the Romans. The Dacians, under the
                    conduct of Decebalus their king, made an irruption, and overthrew the Romans in
                    ſeveral engagements. Loſſes were followed by loſſes, ſo that every ſeaſon became
                    memorable for ſome remarkable overthrow. At laſt, however, the ſtate making a
                    vigorous exertion of its internal power, the barbarians were repelled, partly by
                    force and partly by the aſſiſtance of money, which only ſerved to enable them to
                    make future invaſions to greater advantage. But in whatever manner the enemy
                    might have been repelled, Domitian was reſolved not to loſe the honour of a
                    triumph. He returned in great ſplendor to Rome ; and not contented with thus
                    triumphing twice without a victory, he reſolved to take the ſurname of <hi
                        rend="italic"> Germanicus,</hi> for his conqueſt over a people with whom he
                    never contended.</p>
                <p>In proportion as the ridicule increaſed againſt him, his pride ſeemed every day
                    to demand greater homage. He would permit his ſtatues to be made only of gold
                    and ſilver ; aſſumed to himſelf divine honours ; and ordered that all men ſhould
                    treat him with the ſame a□-pellations which they gave to the divinity. His
                    cruelty was not behind his arrogance ; he cauſed numbers of the moſt illuſtrious
                    ſenators and others to. be put to death upon the moſt trifling pretences.
                    Saluſtius Lucullus, his lieutenant in Britain, was deſtroyed only for-having
                    given his own name to a new ſort of lances of his own invention. Junius Ruſticus
                    died for publiſhing-a book, in which he commended Thraſea and Priſcus, two
                    philoſophers who oppoſed Veſpaſian’e coming to the throne.</p>
                <p>Such cruelties as theſe, that ſeem almoſt without a motive, may naturally be
                    ſuppoſed to have produced rebellion. Lucius Antonius, governor in Upper Germany,
                    knowing how much the emperor was deteſted at home, affιιmed the enſigns of
                    imperial dignity. As he was at the head of a formidable army, Ins ſucceſe
                    remained long doubtful ; but a ſudden overflowing of the Rhine dividing his
                    army, he was ſet upon at that juncture by Normandus, the emperor’s general, and
                    totally routed. The news of this victory, we are told, was brought to Rome by
                    ſupernatund means, on the ſame day that the ſhatfle was ſought. Domitian’s
                    ſeverity was greatly increaſed by this ſucceſs, of ſhort duration. In order to
                    diſcover thoſe who were accomplices with· the adverſe party, he invented new
                    tortures, ſometimes cutting off the hands, at other times thruſting fire into
                    the privities, of the people whom he ſuſpected of being ſhis enemies. During-
                    theſe cruelties, he aggravated</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0426" facs="gri_33125011196389_0432.tif"/>
                <p>their guilt by hypocriſy, never pronouncing ſentence without a preamble full of
                    gentleneſs and mercy. He was particularly terrible to the ſenate and nobility,
                    the whole body of whom he frequently threatened entirely to extirpate. At one
                    time, he ſurrounded the ſenate-houſe with his troops, to the great conſternation
                    ol the ſenators. At another, he reſolved to amuſe himſelſ with their terrors in
                    a different manner. Having invited them to a public entertainment, he received
                    them all very formally at the entrance of his palace, and con&gt; ducted
                    them into a ſpacious hall, hung round with black, and illuminated by a few
                    melancholy lamps, that dif-fuſed light only ſufficient to ſhow the horrors of
                    the place, All around were to be ſeen nothing but coffins, with the names of
                    each of the ſenators written upon them, together with other objects of terror,
                    and inſtruments of execution. While the company beheld all the preparations with
                    ſilent agony, ſeveral men, having their bodies blackened, each with a drawn
                    ſword in one hand and a flaming torch in the other, entered the hall, and danced
                    round them. After ſome time, when the gueſts expected nothing leſs than inſtant
                    death, well knowing Domitian’s capricious cruelty, the doors were ſet open, and
                    one of the ſervants came to inform them, that the emperor gave all the company
                    leave to withdraw.</p>
                <p>Theſe cruelties were rendered ſtill more odious by his luſt and avarice.
                    Frequently after preſiding at an execution, he would retire with the lewdeſt
                    proſtitutes, and uſe the ſame baths which they did. His avarice, which was the
                    conſequence of his profuſion, knew no bounds. He ſeized upon the eſtates of all
                    againſt whom he could find the ſmalleſt pretenſions ; the moſt trifling action
                    or word againſt the majeſty of the prince was ſufficient to ruin the poſſeſſor.
                    He particularly exacted large ſums from the rich Jews ; who even then began to
                    practiſe the art of peculation, for which they are at preſent ſo remarkable He
                    was excited againſt them, not only by avarice, but by jealouſy. À prophecy had
                    been long current in the eaſt, that a perſon from the line of David ſhould rule
                    the world. Whereupon, this ſuſpicious tyrant, willing to evade the prediction,
                    commanded all the Jews of the lineage of David to be diligently ſought out, and
                    put to death. 'Γwo Chriſtians, grandſons of St Jude the apoſtle, of that line,
                    were brought before him; but finding them poor, and uo way ambitious of temporal
                    power, he diſmiſſed them, conſidering them as objects too mean for his jealouſy.
                    However, his perſecution of the Chriſtians was more ſevere than that of any of
                    his predeceſſors. By his letters and edicts they were baniſhed in ſeveral parts
                    of the empire, and put to death with all the tortures of ingenious cruelty. The
                    predictions of Chaldeans and aſtrologers alſo, concerning his death, gave him
                    moſt violent apprehenſions, and kept him in the moſt tormenting diſquietude. As
                    he approached towards the end of his reign, he would permit no criminal, or
                    priſoner, to be brought into his preſence, till they were bound in ſuch a manner
                    as to be incapable of injuring him ; and he generally ſecured their chains in
                    his own hands. His jealouſies increaſed to that degree, that he ordered the
                    gallery in which he walked to be ſet round with a pellucid ſtone, which ſerved
                    as a mirror to reflect the perſons of all ſuch as approached him from behind.
                    Every omen and prodigy gave him freſh anxiety.</p>
                <p>But a period was ſoon to be put to this monſter’s</p>
                <p>cruelty. Among the number of thoſe whom he at ouce careſſed and ſuſpected, was
                    his wiſe Domitia, whom he had taken from Ælius Lama, her former huſhand. This
                    woman, however, was become obnoxious to him, for having placed her affections
                    upon one. Paris, a player ; and he reſolved lo diſpatch her, with ſeveral others
                    that he either hated or ſuipected. It was the tyrant’s method to put down the
                    names of all ſeich as lie intended to deſtroy in his tablets, which he kept
                    about him with great circumſpection. Domitia, fortunately happening to get a
                    fight of them, was ſtruck at finding her own name in the catalogue of thoſe
                    fated to deſtruction. She ſhowed the fatal liſt to Norbanus· and Pe-tronius,
                    præfects of the praetorian bands, who found, themſelves ſet down ; as likewiſe
                    to Stephanus, the comptroller of the houſehold, who came into the conſpiracy
                    with alacrity. Parthenius alſo, the chief chamberlain, was of the number. Theſe,
                    after many con· ſultations, determined on the firſt opportunity to put their
                    deſign in execution ; and at length fixed on the 18th day of September for the
                    completion of their attempt. Domitian, whoſe death was every day fore' told by
                    the aſtrologers, who, of conſequence, muſt at laſt be right in their
                    predictions, was in ſome meaſure apprehenſive σf that day ; and as he had been
                    ever timorous, ſo he was now more particularly upon his guard. He had ſome time
                    before ſecluded himſelf in the moſt ſecret receſſes of his palace ; and at
                    midnight was ſo affrighted as to leap out of his bed, inquiring oſhis attendants
                    what hour of the night it was. Upon their falſely aſſuring him that it was an
                    hour later than that which he was taught to apprehend, quite tranſported, as if
                    all danger was paſt, he prepared to go to the bath. Juſt then, Parthenius his
                    chamberlain came to inform him that Stephanus the comptroller of his houſehold
                    deſired to ſpeak to him upon an affair of the utmoſt importance. The emperor
                    having given orders that his attendants ſhould retire, Stephanus entered with
                    his hand in a ſcarf, which he had worn thus for ſome days, the better to conceal
                    a dagger, as none were permitted to approach the emperor except unarmed.— He
                    began by giving information of a pretended conſpiracy, and exhibited a paper in
                    which the particulars were ſpeciſied. While Domitian was reading the contents
                    with an eager curioſity, Stephanus drew his dagger, and ſtruck him in the groin.
                    The wound not being mortal, Domitian caught hold of the aſſaſſin, and threw him
                    upon the ground, calling out for aſſiſtance. He demanded alſo his ſword, that
                    was uſually placed under his pillow ; and a boy who attended in the apartment
                    running to fetch it, found only the ſcabbard, for Parthenius had previouſly
                    removed the blade. The ſtruggle with Stephanus ſtill continued : Domitian ſtill
                    kept him under, and at one time attempted to wreſt the dagger from his hand, at
                    another to tear out his eyes with his fingers. But Parthenius, with his
                    freedman, a gladiator, and two ſubaltern officers, now coming in, ran all
                    furiouſly upon the emperor, and diſpatched him with many wounds. In the mean
                    time, ſome of the officers of the guard being alarmed, came to his aſſiſtance,
                    but too late to ſave him ; however, they flew Stephanus on the ſpot.</p>
                <p>When it was publicly known that Domitian was ſlain, the joy of the ſenate was ſo
                    great, that being aſſembled with the utmoſt haſte, they began to load his</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0427" facs="gri_33125011196389_0433.tif"/>
                <p>memory with every reproach. H's ſtatues were commanded to be taken down ; and a
                    decree was made, that all his inſeriptions ſhould be eraſed, his name ſtruck out
                    of the regiſters of fame, and his funeral omitted. The people, who now took
                    little part in the affairs of government, looked on his death with indifference
                    ; the ſoldiers alone, whom he had loaded with favours, and enriched by
                    largeſſes, ſincerely regretted their benefactor. The ſenate, therefore, reſolved
                    to provide a ſucceſſor before the army could have an opportunity of taking the
                    appointment upon themſelves ; and Cocceius Nerva was choſen to the empire the
                    very day on which the tyrant was ſlain.</p>
                <p>Nerva was of an illuſtrious family, as moſt ſay, by birth a Spaniard, and above
                    65 years old when he was called to the throne. He was, at that time, the moſt
                    remarkable man in Rome, for his virtues, moderation, and reſpect to the laws ;
                    and he owed his exaltation to the blameleſs conduct of his former life. When the
                    ſenate went to pay him their ſubmiſſions, he received them with his accuſtomed
                    humility ; while Arius Antonius, his moſt intimate friend, having embraced him
                    with great familiarity, congratulated him on his acceſſion to the empire : and
                    indeed no emperor had ever ſhewn himſelf more worthy of the throne than Nerva ;
                    his only fault being that he was too indulgent, and often made a prey by his
                    inſidious courtiers.</p>
                <p>However, an exceſs of indulgence and humanity were faults that Rome could eaſily
                    pardon, after the cruelties of ſuch an emperor as Domitian. Being long
                    accuſtomed to tyranny, they regarded Nerva’s gentle reign with rapture, and even
                    gave his imbecility the name of benevolence. Upon coming to the throne, he
                    ſolemnly ſwore that no ſenator of Rome ſhould be put to death by his command,
                    during his reign, though they gave ever ſo juſt a cauſe. He conferred great
                    favours, and beſtowed large gifts, upon his particular friends. His liberality
                    was ſo extenſive, that, upon his firſt promotion to the empire, he was
                    conſtrained to ſell his gold and ſilver plate, with his other rich moveables, to
                    enable him to continue his liberalities. He releaſed the cities of the empire
                    from many ſevere impoſitions, which had been laid upon them by Veſpaſian ; took
                    off a rigorous tribute, which had been laid upon carriages; and reſtored thoſe
                    to their property who had been unjuſtly diſpoſſeſſed by Domitian.</p>
                <p>During his ſhort reign he made ſeveral good laws. He particularly prohibited the
                    caſtration of male children ; which had been likewiſe condemned by his
                    predeceſſor, but not wholly removed. He put all thoſe ſlaves to death who had,
                    during the laſt reign, informed againſt their maſters. He permitted no ſtatues
                    to be erected to honour him, and converted into money ſuch of Domitian’s as had
                    been ſpared by the ſenate. He ſold many rich robes, and much of the ſplendid
                    furniture of the palace, and retrenched ſeveral unrea-fonable expences at court.
                    At the ſame time, he had ſo little regard for money, that when Herodes Atticus,
                    one of his ſubjects, had found a large treaſure, and wrote to the emperor how to
                    diſpoſe of it, he received for anſwer, that he might <hi rend="italic">uſe it ;</hi> but tire finder ſtill informing the emperor that it was a fortune too
                    large for a private perſon, Nerva, admiring his honeſty, wrote him word, that
                    then he might <hi rend="italic">abuſe it.</hi></p>
                <p>A hſe of ſuch generoſity and mildneſs was not,</p>
                <p>however, without its enemies. Calpurnius Craſſiis, with ſome others, formed a
                    dangerous conſpiracy to deſtroy him ; but Nerva would uſe no ſeverity : he
                    reſted ſatisfied with baniſhing thoſe who were culpable, though the ſenate were
                    for inflicting more rigorous puniſhments. But the moſt dangerous inſurrection
                    againſt his intereſts was from the prætorian bands ; who, headed by Caſpa-rius
                    Olianus, inſiſted upon revenging the late emperor’s death, whoſe memory was
                    ſtill dear to them from his frequent liberalities. Nerva, whoſe kindneſs to good
                    men rendered him ſtill more obnoxious to the vicious, did all in his power to
                    ſtop the progreſs of this inſurrection ; he preſented himſelf to the mutinous
                    ſoldiers, and, opening his boſom, deſired them to ſtrike there, rather than be
                    guilty of ſo much injuſtice. The ſoldiers, however, paid no regard to his
                    remonſtrances ; but, ſeizing upon Petronius and Parthenius, flew the n in the
                    moſt ignominious manner. Not content with this, they even compelled the emperor
                    to approve of their ſedition, and to make a ſpeech to-the people, in which he
                    thanked the cohorts ſor their fidelity. So diſagreeable a conſtraint upon the
                    emperor’s inclinations was, in the end, attended with the moſt happy effects, as
                    it cauſed the adoption of Trajan to ſucceed him in the empire. Nerva perceived
                    that in the preſent turbulent diſpoſition of the times, he ſtood in need of an
                    aſſiſtant in the empire, who might ſhare the fatigues of government, and
                    contribute to keep the licentious in awe. For this purpoſe, ſetting aſide all
                    his own relations, he fixed upon Ulpius Trajan, an utter ſtranger to his family,
                    who was then governor in Upper Germany, to ſucceed him. Having put his
                    determination in execution, and performed the accuſtomed ſolemnities, he
                    inſtantly ſent off ambaſſadors to Cologne, where Trajan then reſided, intreating
                    his aſſiſtance in puniſhing thoſe from whom he had received ſuch an inſult The
                    adoption of this admirable man, proved ſo great a curb to the licentiouſneſs of
                    the ſoldiery, that they continued in perfect obedience during the reſt of this
                    reign ; and Caſparius being ſent to him, was, by his command, either baniſhed or
                    put to death.</p>
                <p>The adopting Trajan was the laſt public act of Nerva. In about three months
                    after, having put him· ſelf in a violent paſſion with one Regulus a ſenator, he
                    was ſeized with a fever, of which he ſhortly after died, after a ſhort reign of
                    one year four months and nine days. He was the firſt foreign emperor who reigned
                    in Rome, and juſtly reputed a prince of great generoſity and moderation. He is
                    alſo celebrated for his wiſdom, though with leſs reaſon, the greateſt inſtance
                    he gave of it, during his reign, being in the choice of his ſucceſſor.</p>
                <p>Trajan’s family was originally ſrom Italy, but he himſelf was born in Seville in
                    Spain. He very early accompanied his father, who was a general of the Romans, in
                    his expeditions along the Euphrates and the Rhine ; and while yet very young,
                    acquired a conſiderable reputation for military accompliſhments. He enured his
                    body to fatigue ; he made long marches on foot ; and laboured to acquire all
                    that ſkill in war which was neceſſary for a commander. When he was made general
                    of the army in Lower Germany, which was one of the moſt conſiderable employments
                    in the empire, it made no alteration in his manners or way of living ; and the
                    commander was ſeen noway differing from the private tribune, except in his
                    ſuperior wiſdom and vir-</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0428" facs="gri_33125011196389_0434.tif"/>
                <p>tues. The great qualities of liis trind were accompanied with all the advantages
                    of perſon. His body was majeſtic and vigorous ; he was at that middle time of
                    life which is happily tempered with the warmth of youth and the caution of age,
                    being 42 years old. To theſe qualities were added, a modeſty that ſeemed
                    peculiar to himſelf alone ; ſo that mankind found a pleaſure in praiſing thoſe
                    accompliſhments of which the pofleiΓor ſeemed no way conſcious. Upon the whole,
                    Trajan is diſtinguiſhed as the greateſt and the beſt emperor of Rome. Others
                    might have equalled him in war, and ſome might have been his rivals in clemency
                    and goodneſs ; but he ſeems the only prince who. united theſe talents in the
                    greateſt perfection, and who appears equally to engage our admiration and our
                    regard. Upon being informed of the death of Nerva, he prepared to return to
                    Rome, whither he was invited by the united intreaties of the ſtate. He therefore
                    began his march with a diſcipline that was for a long time unknown in the armies
                    of the empire. The countries through which he paſſed were neither ravaged nor
                    taxed, and he entered the city, not in a triumphant manner, though he had
                    deſerved it often, but on foot, attended by the civil officers of the ſtate, and
                    followed by his ſoldiers, who marched ſilently forward with modeſty and reſpect.
                    It would be tedious and unneceſſary to enter into a detail of this good
                    monarch’s labours for the ſtate. Hisapplication to buſineſs, his moderation to
                    his enemies, his modeſty in exaltation, his liberality to the deſerving,and
                    hisfrugality in his own expences ; theſe have all been the ſubject of panegyric
                    among his contemporaries, and they continue to be the admiration of poſterity.
                    Upon giving the prefect of the pretorian band the ſword, according to cuſtom, he
                    made uſe of this remarkable expreſſion,</p>
                <p>Take this ſword, and uſe it, if I have merit, for me ; if otherwiſe, againſt
                    me.” After which he added, That he who gave laws was the firſt who was bound to
                    obſerve them. His failings were his love of women, which, however, never hurried
                    him beyond the bounds of decency ; and his immoderate paſſion for war, to which
                    he had been bred up from his childhood. The firſt war he was engaged in after
                    his coming to the throne was with the Dacians, who, during the reign of
                    Domitian, had committed numberleſs ravages upon rhe provinces of the empire. He
                    therefore raiſed a powerful army, and with great expedition marched into thoſe
                    barbarous countries, where he was vigorouſly oppoſed by Decebalus, the Dacian
                    king, who ſor a long time withſtood his boldeſt efforts ; but was at laſt
                    entirely reduced, and his kingdom made a Roman province, See Dacia. At his
                    return to Rome, he entered the city in triumph ; and the rejoicings for his
                    victories laſted for the ſpace of 120 days.</p>
                <p>Having thus given peace and proſperity to the empire, Trajan continued his
                    reign, loved, honoured, and almoſt adored, by his ſubjects. He adorned the city
                    with public buildings ; he freed it from ſuch men as lived by their vices ; he
                    entertained perſons of merit with the utmoſt familiarity ; and ſo little feared
                    his enemies, that he could ſearcely be induced to ſuppoſe that he had any.</p>
                <p>It had been happy for this great prince’s memory', if he had ſhown equal
                    clemency to all his ſubjects; but, about the ninth year of his reign, he was
                    perfuadcd to</p>
                <p>look upon the Chriſtians with a ſuſpictous eye. The extreme veneration which he
                    profeſſed for the religion of the empire, ſet him ſedulouſly to oppoſe every
                    innovation, and the progreſs of Chriſtianity ſeemed to alarm him. A law had for
                    ſome time before beed paſſed, in which all Heteriæ, or ſocieties diſſenting from
                    the eſtabliſhed religion, were conſidered as illegal, being reputed nurſeries of
                    impoſture and ſedition. Under the fonction of this law, the Chriſtians were
                    perſecuted in all parts of the empire. Great numbers of them were put to death,
                    as well by popular tumults as by edicts and judicial proceedings. However, the
                    perſecution ceaſed after ſome time ; for the emperor having advice from Pliny,
                    the pro-conſul in Bithynia, of the innocence and ſimplicity of the Chriſtians,
                    and of their inoffenlive and moral way of living, he ſuſpended their
                    puniſhments. But a total ſtop was put to them upon Tiberianus the governor of
                    Paleſtine’s ſending him word, That he was wearied out with executing the laws
                    againſt the. Galileans, who crouded to execution in ſuch multitudes; that he was
                    at a loſs how to proceed. Upon this iιu formation, the emperor gave orders, that
                    the Chriſtians ſhould not be ſought after ; but if any offered themſelves, that
                    they ſhould ſuffer. In this manner the rage of perſecution ceaſed, and the
                    emperor found leiſure to., turn the force of his arms againſt the Armenians and
                    Parthians, who now began to throw off all ſubmiſſion to Rome.</p>
                <p>While he was employed in theſe wars, there was a dreadful inſurrection of the
                    Jews in all parts of the empire. This wretched people, ſtill infatuated, and
                    ever expecting ſome ſignal deliverer, took the advantage of Trajan’s abſence in
                    the eaſt to maſſacre all the Greeks and Romans whom they got into their power,
                    without reluctance or mercy. This rebellion firſt began in Cy-rene, a Roman
                    province in Africa ; from thence the flame extended to Egypt, and next to the
                    iſland of Cyprus. Theſe places they in a manner diſpeopled with ungovernable
                    fury. Their barbarities were ſuch, that they eat the fleſh of their enemies,
                    wore their ſkins, fowed them aſunder, caſt them to wild beaſts, made them kill
                    each other, and ſtudied new torments by which to deſtroy them. However, theſe
                    cruelties were of no long duration: the governors of the reſpective provinces
                    making head againſt their tumultuous fury, ſoon treated them with a retaliation
                    of cruelty, and put them to death, not as human beings, but as outrageous peſt3
                    to ſociety. As the Jews had practiſed their cruelties in Cyprus particularly, a
                    law was publicly enacted, by which it was made capital for any Jew to ſet foot
                    on the iſland.</p>
                <p>During theſe bloody tranſactions, Trajan was proſecuting his ſucceſſes in the
                    eaſt. His firſt march was into Armenia, the king of which country had diſclaimed
                    all alliance with Rome, and received the enſigns of royalty and dominion from
                    the monarch of Parthia. How» ever, upon the news of Trajan’s expedition, his
                    fears were ſo great, that he abandoned his country to the invaders ; while the
                    greateſt part of his governors and nobility came ſubmiſſively to the emperor,
                    acknowledging themſelves his ſubjects, and making him the moſt coſtly preſents.
                    Having in this manner taken poſſeſſion of the whole country, and gotten the king
                    into his power, he marched into the dominions of the</p>

                <p>king of Parthia. There entering the opulent kingdom of Mefoρυtamia, he reduced
                    it into the form of a Roman province. From thence he went againſt the Pap∙
                    thians, marching on foot at the head of his army ; in this manner croſſing the
                    rivers, and conforming to all the ſeverities of diſcipline which were impoſed on
                    the meaneſt ſoldier. His ſucceſſes againſt the Parthians were great and
                    numerous. He conquered Syria and Chaldea, and took the famous city of Babylon.
                    Here, attempting to crois the Euphrates, he was oppoſed by the enemy, who were
                    reſolved to ſtop his paſſage : but he ſecretly cauſed boats to be made upon the
                    adjoining mountains; and bringing them to the water ſide, paſſed his army with
                    great expedition, not, however, without great ſlaughter on both ſides. From
                    thence he tra-verſed tracts of country which had never before been invaded by a
                    Roman army, and ſeemed to take a pleaſure in purſuing the ſame march which
                    Alexander the Great had formerly marked out for him. Having paſſed the rapid
                    ſtreams of the Tigris, he advanced to the city Cteſiphon, which he took, and
                    opened himſelf a paſſage into Perlia, where he made many conqueſts, that were
                    rather ſplendid than ſerviceable. After ſubduing all the country bordering on
                    the Tigris, he marched ſouthward to the Perſian gulph, where he ſubdued a
                    monarch who poſſeſſed a conſiderable iſland made by the divided ſtreams of that
                    river. Here, winter coming on, he was in danger of loſing the greateſt part of
                    his army by the inclemency of the climate and the inundations of the river. He
                    therefore with indefatigable pains fitted out a fleet, and ſailing down the
                    Perſian gulph, entered the Indian ocean, conquering, even to the Indies, and
                    ſubduing a part of them to the</p>
                <p>Roman empire. He was prevented from purſuing further conqueſts in this diſtant
                    country, both by the revolt of many of the provinces he had already ſubdued, and
                    by the ſcarcity of proviſions, which ſeemed to contradict the reports of the
                    fertility of the countries he was induced to invade. The inconveniences of
                    increaſing age alſo contributed to damp the ardour of this enterpriſe, which at
                    one time he intended to purſue to the confines of the earth. Returning,
                    therefore, along the Perſian gulph, and ſending the ſenate a particular account
                    of all the nations he had conquered, the names of which alone compoſed a long
                    catalogue, he prepared to puniſh thoſe countries which had revolted from him. He
                    began by laying the famous city of Edeſſa, in Me-ſopotamia, in allies ; and in a
                    ſhort ſpace of time, not only retook all thoſe places which had before
                    acknowledged ſubjection, but conquered many other provinces, ſo as to make
                    himſelf maſter of the moſt fertile kingdoms of all Aſia. In this train of
                    ſucceſſes he ſcarce met with a repulſe, except before the city Atra, in the
                    deſerts of Arabia. Wherefore judging that this was a proper time for bounding
                    his conqueſts, he reſolved to give a maſter to the countries he had ſubdued.
                    With this reſolution he repaired to the city Cteſiphon, in. Rerſia ; and there,
                    with great ceremony, crowned Par-thamaſpates king of Parthia, to the great joy
                    of all his ſubjects. Fie eſtabliſhed another king alſo over the kingdom of
                    Albania, near the Caſpian ſea. Then placing governors and lieutenants in other
                    provinces, he reſolved to return to his capital in a more magnificent manner
                    than any of his predeceſſors had done before him. He accordingly leſt Adrian
                    general of ail</p>
                <p>his forces in the eaſt ; and continued his journey towards Rome, where the moſt
                    magnificent preparations were made for his arrival. However, he had not got
                    farther than the province of Cilicia, when he found himſelf too weak to proceed
                    in his uſual manner. He therefore cauſed himſelf to be carried on ſhip-board to
                    the city of Seleucia, where he died of the apoplexy, having been attacked by
                    that diſorder once before. During the time of his indiſpoſition, his wife
                    Plotina conſtantly attended near him ; and, knowing the emperor’s diſlike to
                    Adrian, it is thought forged the will, by which, he was adopted to ſucceed.</p>
                <p>Trajan died in the 63d year of his age, after a reign of nineteen years ſix
                    months and fifteen days. How highly he was eſteemed by his ſubjects appears by
                    their manner of bleſſing his ſucceſſors, always wiſhing them the fortune of
                    Auguſtus, and the goodneſs of Trajan. His military virtues, however, upon which
                    he chiefly valued himſelf, produced no real advantages to his country ; and all
                    his conqueſts diſappeared, when the power was withdrawn that enforced them.</p>
                <p>Adrian was by deſcent a Spaniard, and his anceſtors were of the ſame city where
                    Trajan was born. He was nephew to Trajan, and married to Sabina∣his grand-niece.
                    When Trajan was adopted to the empire, Adrian was a tribune of the army in
                    Maeſia, and was ſent by the troops to congratulate the emperor on his
                    advancement. However, his brother-in-law, who deſired to have an opportunity of
                    congratulating Trajan himſelf, ſupplied Adrian with a carriage that broke down
                    on the way. But Adrian w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> as reſolved to loſe no time,
                    and performed the reſt of the journey on foot. This aſſiduity was very pleaſing
                    to the emperor ; but he diſliked Adrian from ſeveral more prevailing motives.
                    His kinſman was expenſive, and involved in debt. He was, beſides, inconſtant,
                    capricious, and apt to envy another’s reputation. Theſe were faults, that, in
                    Trajan’s opinion, could not be compenſated either by his learning or his
                    talents. His great ſkill in the Greek and Latin languages, his intimate
                    acquaintance with the laws of lſis country and the philoſophy of the times, were
                    no inducement to Trajan, who, being bred himſelf a ſoldier, deſired to have a
                    military man to ſucceed him. For this reaſon it was that the dying emperor would
                    by no means appoint a ſucceſſor ; fearful, perhaps, of injuring his great
                    reputation, by adopting a perſon that was unworthy. His death, therefore, was
                    concealed for ſome time by Plotina his wiſe, till Adrian had founded the
                    inclinations of the army, and found them firm in his intereſts. 'Γhey then
                    produced a forged inſtrument, importing that Adrian was adopted to ſucceed in
                    the empire. By this artifice he was elected by-all orders of the ſtate, though
                    then abſent from Rome, being left at Antioch as general of the forces in the
                    eaſt.</p>
                <p>Upon Adrian’s election, his firſt care was to write the ſenate, excuſing himſelf
                    for aſſuming the empire without their previous approbation ; imputing it to the
                    haſty zeal of the army, who rightly judged that the ſenate ought not long to
                    remain without a head. He then began to purſeie a courſe quite oppoſite to that
                    of his predeceſſor, taking every method of declining war, and promoting the arts
                    of peace. He was quite ſatisfied with preſerving the ancient limits of the
                    empire, and ſeemed no way ambitious of extenſive conqueſt.</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0430" facs="gri_33125011196389_0436.tif"/>
                <p>For this reaſon he abandoned all the conqueſts which Trajan had made, judging
                    them to be rather an inconvenience than an advantage to the empire; and made ;
                    the river Euphrates the boundary of the empire, placing the legions along its
                    banks to prevent the incurſions of the enemy.</p>
                <p>Having thus ſettled the affairs of the eaſt, and leaving Severus governor of
                    Syria, he took his journey by land to Rome, ſending the aſhes of Trajan thither
                    by ſea. Upon his approach to the city, he was informed of a magnificent triumph
                    that was preparing for him; but this he modeſtly declined, deſiring that thoſe
                    honours might be paid to Trajan’s memory which they had deſigned for him. In
                    conſequence of this command, a moſt ſuperb triumph was decreed, in which
                    Trajan’s ſtatue was carried as a principal figure in the proceſſion, it being
                    remarked that he was the only man that ever triumphed after he was dead. Not
                    content with paying him theſe extraordinary honours, his aſhes were placed in a
                    golden urn, upon the top of a column 140 feet high. On this were engraven the
                    particulars of all his exploits in baſſo relievo; a work of great labour, and
                    which is ſtill remaining. Theſe teſtimonies of reſpect to the memory of his
                    predeceſſor did great honour to the heart of Adrian. His virtues, however, were
                    contraſted by a ſtrange mixture of vices; or to ſay the truth, he wanted
                    ſtrength of mind to preſerve his general rectitude of character without
                    deviation. As an emperor, however, his conduct was moſt admirable, as all his
                    public tranſactions appear dictated by the ſoundeſt policy and the moſt
                    diſin-tereſted wiſdom. But theſe being already enumerated under the article
                    Adrian, it would be ſuperfluous to repeat them in this place. He was ſucceeded
                    by Marcus Antoninus, afterwards ſurnamed the <hi rend="italic">Pious,</hi> whom he had adopted ſome time before his death. See <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps"> Antoninus Pius.</hi></hi> From the beginning of the reign of Antoninus Pius, we may date the decline
                    of the Roman empire. From the time of Cæſar to that of Trajan, ſcarce any of the
                    emperors had either abilities or inclination to extend the limits of the empire,
                    or even to defend it againſt the barbarous nations who ſurrounded it. During all
                    this ſpace, only ſome inconſiderable provinces to the northward of Italy, and
                    part of the iſland of Britain, had Keen ſubjugated. However, as yet, nothing was
                    loſt; but the degeneracy and corruption of the people had ſown thoſe ſeeds of
                    diſſolution which the empire quickly began to feel. The diſorders were grown to
                    ſuch an height, that even Trajan himſelſ could not cure them. Indeed his eaſtern
                    conqueſts could ſcarce have been preſerved though the republic had been exiſting
                    in all its glory; and therefore they were quietly reſigned by his ſucceſſor
                    Adrian, as too diſtant, diſaffected, and ready to be over-run by the barbarous
                    nations. The province of Dacia, being nearer to the centre of government, was
                    more eaſily preſerved; and of conſequence remained for a long time ſubject to
                    Rome. During the 23 years of the reign of Antoninus, few remarkable events
                    happened. The hiſtorians of thoſe times are exceſſive in their praiſes of his
                    juſtice, generoſity, and other virtues, both public and private. He put a ſtop
                    to the perſecution of the Chriſtians, which raged in the time of Trajan and
                    Adrian, and reduced the Brigantes, a tribe of Britons, who had revolted.
                    However, during his reign, ſeveral calamities befel the empire. The Tiber,
                    overflowing its banks, laid the lower part of Rome under water. The inundation
                    was followed by a fire, and this by a famine, which ſwept off great numbers,
                    though the emperor took the utmoſt care to ſupply the city from the moſt diſtant
                    provinces. At the ſame time the cities of Narbonne in Gaul, and Antioch in
                    Syria, together with the great ſquare in Garthage, were deſtroyed by fire;
                    however, the emperor ſoon reſtored them to their former condition. He died in
                    the year 163, univerſally lamented by his ſubjects, and was ſucceeded by Marcus
                    Aurelius, ſurnamed the <hi rend="italic">Philoſopher,</hi> whom he had adopted
                    towards the latter end of his reign.</p>
                <p>The tranſactions of this emperor the reader will find related under the article <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps"> Antoninus Philoſophus </hi></hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="2">
                        <p>As, after the death of Marcus Aurelius, the Roman empire declined very
                            faſt, it may not be amiſs here to give ſome account of the military and
                            other eſtabliſhments of the Roman emperors. Mr Gibbon obſerves, that, in
                            the times of the commonwealth, the uſe of arms was confined to thoſe who
                            had ſome property to defend, and an intereſt in maintaining the laws
                            which were propoſed to be enacted. But, as the public freedom declined,
                            and war became degraded into a trade, thoſe who had the property of the
                            country choſe rather to hire others than to expoſe their own perſons, as
                            is the caſe with our modern armies. Yet, even after all conſideration of
                            property had been laid aſide among the common ſoldiers, the officers
                            continued to be choſen from among thoſe who had a liberal education,
                            together with a good ſhare of property. However, as the common ſoldiers,
                            in which the ſtrength of an army conſiſts, had now no more of that
                            virtue called <hi rend="italic">patriotiſm,</hi> the legions which were
                            formerly almoſt invincible, no longer fought with the ſame ardour as
                            before. In former times, the profeſſion of a ſoldier was more honourable
                            than any other; but, when the ſoldiers came to be looked upon as hire-,
                            lings, the honour of the profeſſion funk of courſe, and, by this means,
                            one of the ſtrongeſt motives which the ſoldiers had to ſubmit to their
                            ſevere diſcipline, and exert themſelves againſt their enemies, was
                            removed. On the very firſt entrance of a ſoldier into the Roman ſervice,
                            a ſolemn oath was adminiſtered to him, by which he engaged never to
                            deſert his ſtandard; to ſubmit his own will to that of his leaders, and
                            to ſacriſice his life for the ſafety of the emperor and the empire. The
                            attachment which the Romans had to their ſtandards was indeed
                            aſtoniſhing. The golden eagle, which appeared in the front of the
                            legion, was almoſt an object of adoration with them; and it was eſteemed
                            impious, as well as ignominious, to abandon that ſacred enſign in the
                            time of danger. The centurions had a right to puniſh with blows, the
                            generals with death; and it was an inflexible maxim of the Roman
                            diſcipline, that a good ſoldier ſhould dread his officers much more than
                            the enemy.</p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding all this, ſo ſenſible were the Romans of the
                            inſufficiency of mere valour without ſkill, that <pb/> military
                            exerciſes were the unremitted object of their diſcipline. The recruits
                            and young ſoldiers were conſtantly trained both in the morning and
                            evening; and even the veterans were not excuſed from the daily
                            repetition of their exerciſe. Large ſheds were erected in the
                            winter-quarters of the troops, that theſe uſeful laboura might not be
                            interrupted by tempeſtuous weather, and the weapons uſed in theſe
                            imitations of war were always twice as heavy as thoſe made uſe of in
                            real action. The ſoldiers were diligently inſtructed to march, to run,
                            leap, ſwim, carry heavy burdens, and handle every ſpecies of weapon
                            either for offence or defence; to form a variety of evolutions; and to
                            move to the ſound of flutes in the pyrrhic or martial dance. It was the
                            policy of the ableſt generals, and even of the emperors themſelves, to
                            encourage theſe military ſtudies by their preſence and example; and we
                            are informed that Adrian, as well as Trajan, frequently condeſcended to
                            inſtruct the unexperienced ſoldiers, to reward the diligent, and
                            ſometimes to diſpute with them the prize of ſuperior ſtrength and
                            dexterity. Under the reigns of thoſe princes, the ſcience of tactics was
                            cultivated with ſucceſs; and, as long as the empire retained any vigour,
                            their military inſtructions were reſpected as the moſt perfect model of
                            Roman diſcipline.</p>
                        <p>From the foundation of the city, as the Romans had in a manner been
                            continually engaged in war, many alterations had taken place in the
                            conſtitution of the legions. In the time of the emperors, the
                            heavy-armed infantry, which compoſed its principal ſtrength, was divided
                            into 10 cohorts and 55 companies, under the orders of a correſpondent
                            number of tribunes and centurions. The firſt cohort, which always
                            claimed the poſt of honour and the cuſtody of the eagle, was formed of
                            1105 ſoldiers, the moſt approved for valour and fidelity. The remaining
                            nine cohorts conſiſted each of 555; and the whole body of legionary
                            infantry conſiſted of 6100 men. Their arms were uniform, and excellently
                            adapted to the nature of their ſervice; an open helmet with a lofty
                            creſt; a breaſt-plate or coat of mail; greaves on their legs, and a
                            large buckler on their left arm. Their buckler was of an oblong and
                            concave figure, four ſeet in length, and two and an half in breadth;
                            framed of a light wood, covered with a bull’s hide, and ſtrongly guarded
                            with braſs plates. Beſides a lighter ſpear, the legionary carried the
                            pilum, a ponderous javelin about ſix feet long, and terminated by a
                            maſſy triangular point of ſteel 18 inches in length. This weapon could
                            do execution at the diſtance of 10 or 12 paces; but its ſtroke was ſo
                            powerful, that no cavalry durſt venture within its reach, and ſcarce any
                            armour could be formed proof againſt it. As ſoon as the Roman had darted
                            his pilum, he drew his ſword, and ruſhed forward to cloſe with the
                            enemy. It was a ſhort well-tempered Spaniſh blade with a double edge,
                            and equally calculated for the purpoſes of puſhing and ſtriking; but the
                            ſoldier was always inſtructed to prefer the former uſe of his own
                            weapon, as his body remained thereby the leſs expoſed, while at the ſame
                            time he inflicted a more dangerous wound on his adverſary.</p>
                        <p>The legion was uſually drawn up eight deep; and the regular diſtance of
                            three feet was left between the files and ranks. Thus the ſoldier
                            poſſeſſed a free ſpace for his arms and motions; and ſufficient
                            intervals were allowed, through which ſeaſonable reinforcements might be
                            introduced to the relief of the combatants. The cavalry, without which
                            the force of the legion remained imperfect, was divided into ten troops
                            or ſquadrons: the firſt, as the companion of the firſt cohort, conſiſted
                            of 132 men; whilſt each of the other nine amounted only to 66. The
                            entire eſtabliſhment formed a body of 726 horſe, naturally connected
                            with its reſpective legion; but occaſionally acting in the line, and
                            compoſing a part of the wings of the army. The cavalry of the ancient
                            republic was compoſed of the nobleſt youths of Rome and Italy, who, by
                            performing their military ſervice on horſeback, prepared themſelves for
                            the offices of ſenator and conſul; but after the alteration of manners
                            and government which took place at the end of the commonwealth, the moſt
                            wealthy of the equeſtrian order were engaged in the adminiſtration of
                            juſtice and of the revenue; and, whenever they embraced the profeſſion
                            of arms, they were immediately entruſted with a troop of horſe or a
                            cohort of foot, and the cavalry, as well as the infantry, were recruited
                            from the provinces. The horſes were bred for the moſt part in Spain, or
                            in Cappadocia. The Roman troopers deſpiſed the complete armour which
                            encumbered the cavalry of the eaſt. Inſtead of this, their arms
                            conſiſted only of an helmet, an oblong ſhield, light boots, and a coat
                            of mail. A javelin and a long broad ſword were their principal offenſive
                            weapons. They ſeem to have borrowed the uſe of lances and iron maces
                            from the barbarians.</p>
                        <p>Beſides the legionaries, the Romans, eſpecially in the times of the
                            emperors, began to take auxiliaries into their pay. Conſiderable levies
                            were regularly made among thoſe provincials who had not yet attained to
                            the rank of Roman citizens. Many dependent princes and communities,
                            diſperſed round the frontiers, were permitted, for a while, to hold
                            their freedom and ſecurity by the tenure of military ſervice. Even
                            ſelect troops of barbarians were compelled to enter into the ſervice;
                            which was afterwards found to be a moſt deſtructive expedient, not only
                            as it carried the Roman military ſkill among barbarians who were
                            otherwiſe unacquainted with it, but it gave theſe auxiliaries themſelves
                            frequent opportunities of revolting, and at laſt of dethroning the
                            emperors at pleaſure, and even of overturning the empire itſelf. The
                            number of auxiliaries was ſeldom inferior to that of the legionaries
                            themſelves. The braveſt and moſt faithful bands among them were placed
                            under the command of prefects and centurions, and ſeverely trained in
                            the arts of Roman diſcipline; but the far greater part retained thoſe
                            arms which they had uſed in their native country. By this inſtitution,
                            each legion, to whom a certain number of auxiliaries was allotted,
                            contained within itſelf every ſpecies of lighter troops, and of miſſile
                            weapons; <pb/>and was capable of encountering every nation with the
                            advantages of its reſpective arms and diſcipline. Nor was the legion
                            deſtitute of what, in modern language, would be ſtyled a train of
                            artillery. This conſiſted of 10 military engines of the largeſt ſize,
                            and 56 ſmaller ones; but all of them, either in an oblique or horizontal
                            manner, diſcharged ſtones and darts with irreſiſtible violence.</p>
                        <p>The camp of a Roman legion preſented the appearance of a fortified city.
                            As ſoon as the ſpace was marked out, the pioneers carefully levelled the
                            ground, and removed every impediment that might interrupt its perfect
                            regularity, its form was an exact quadrangle; and it may be computed
                            that a ſquare of 700 yards was ſufficient for the encampment of 20, 000
                            Romans, though a ſimilar number of modern troops would expoſe to the
                            enemy a front of more than treble that extent. In the midſt of the camp,
                            the prætorium, or general’s tent, aroſe above the others; and the
                            cavalry, infantry, and auxiliaries, had each their reſpective ſtations
                            appointed them. The ſtreets were broad, and perfectly ſtraight; and a
                            vacant ſpace of 200 ſeet was left on all ſides between the tents and
                            rampart. The rampart itſelf was 12 feet high, armed with a line of
                            ſtrong and intricate paliſades, and defended by a ditch 12 feet deep and
                            as much broad. This labour was performed by the legions themſelves, to
                            whom the uſe of the ſpade and the pick-ax was no leſs familiar than that
                            of the ſword or piluin. Whenever the trumpet gave the ſignal of
                            departure, the camp was almoſt inſtantly broke up, and the troops fell
                            into their ranks without delay or confuſion. Beſides their arms, which
                            the ſoldiers ſcarcely conſidered as an incumbrance, they were laden with
                            their kitchen-furniture, the inſtruments of fortification, and
                            proviſions for many days. Under this weight, which would oppreſs a
                            modern ſoldier, they were taught to advance by a regular ſtep, near 20
                            miles in ſix hours. On the appearance of an enemy, they threw aſide
                            their baggage, and, by eaſy and rapid evolutions, converted the column
                            of march into an order of battle. The ſlingers and archers ſkirmiſhed in
                            the front; the auxiliaries formed the firſt line, and were ſeconded or
                            ſuſtained by the legions. The cavalry covered the flanks, and the
                            military engines were placed in the rear.</p>
                        <p>The numbers of the Roman armies are not eaſily calculated with any
                            tolerable accuracy. We may compute, however, that the legion, which
                            conſiſted of 6831 Romans, might, with its attendant auxiliaries, amount
                            to 12, 500 men. The peace eſtabliſhment of Adrian and his ſucceſſors was
                            compoſed of no fewer than 30 of theſe formidable brigades; and moſt
                            probably formed an army of 370, 000 men. Inſtead of being confined
                            within the walls of fortified cities, which the Romans conſidered as the
                            refuge of weakneſs or puſillanimity, the legions were encamped on the
                            banks of the great rivers, and along the frontiers of the barbarians.
                            Three legions were ſuffi-cient for Britain. The principal ſtrength lay
                            upon the Rhine and Danube, and conſiſted of 16 legions, diſpoſed in the
                            following proportions: two in the Lower, and three in the Upper Germany;
                            one in Rhætia; one in Noricum; four in Pannonia; three in Mæſia; and two
                            in Dacia. The defence of the Euphrates was intruſted to eight legions,
                            ſix of whom were placed in Syria, and the other two in Cappadocia. With
                            regard to Egypt, Africa, and Spain, as they were far removed from any
                            important ſcene of war, a ſingle legion maintained the domeſtic
                            tranquillity of each of thoſe great provinces. Italy was defended by the
                            city cohorts and prætorian guards formerly mentioned. Theſe differed
                            nothing from the legions in their arms and inſtitutions, except in a
                            more ſplendid appearance, and a leſs rigid diſcipline.</p>
                        <p>The Roman navy, though ſufficient for every uſeful purpoſe of
                            government, never ſeemed adequate to the greatneſs of the empire. The
                            policy of the emperors was directed only to preſerve the peaceful
                            dominion of the Mediterranean ſea, which was included within their
                            dominions, and to protect the commerce of their ſubjects. Two permanent
                            fleets were ſtationed by Auguſtus, one at Ravenna on the Adriatic, and
                            the other at Miſenum in the bay of Naples. A very conſiderable force was
                            alſo ſtationed at Frejus in Provence; and the Euxine was guarded by 40
                            ſhips and 3000 ſoldiers. To all theſe we may add the fleet which
                            preſerved the communication between Gaul and Britain, and a great number
                            of veſſels conſtantly maintained on the Rhine and Danube to ha-raſs the
                            enemy, or intercept the paſſage of the barbarians. The whole military
                            eſtabliſhment by ſea and land amounted to about 450, 000 men.</p>
                        <p>It was not, however, to this formidable power alone that the empire owed
                            its greatneſs. The policy of the laws contributed as much to its ſupport
                            as the martial eſtabliſhment itſelf. According to Mr Gibbon, though the
                            provinces might occaſionally ſuffer from the partial abuſe of delegated
                            authority, the general principle of government was wiſe, ſimple, and
                            beneficent. Among theſe beneficent principles he reckons that of
                            univerſal toleration; but to this there were ſeveral exceptions: for the
                            Britiſh Druids were perſecuted and deſtroyed by the Romans on account of
                            their religion; the Egyptians and Jews were ſometimes perſecuted; and
                            the Chriſtians were frequently ſo, and that even under the very beſt
                            emperors, Trajan and Marcus Aurelius. However, as a very general
                            toleration of religious ſentiments did take place under the heathen
                            emperors of Rome, we muſt certainly look upon this as one of the cauſes
                            of the proſperity of the empire.</p>
                        <p>Another thing which greatly contributed to the ſtrength and proſperity
                            of the empire, was the extending of the freedom of Rome to ſo many
                            people, " The narrow policy (ſays Mr Gibbon) of preſerving, without any
                            foreign mixture, the pure blood of the ancient citizens, had checked the
                            fortune and haſtened the ruin of Athens and Sparta. During the moſt
                            flouriſhing era of the Athenian commonwealth, the number of citizens
                            decreaſed gradually from about 30, 000 to 21, 000. If, on the contrary,
                            we ſtudy the growth of the Roman republic, we <pb/>may diſcover, that
                            notwithſtanding the inceſſant demands of wars and colonies, the
                            citizens, who, in the time of Servius Tullius, amounted to no more than
                            83, 000, were multiplied, before the end of the ſocial war, to the
                            number of 463, 000 men able to bear arms in the ſervice of their
                            country. When the allies of Rome claimed an equal ſhare of honours and
                            privileges, the ſenate preferred the chance of war to a conceſſion;
                            however, at laſt, all the Italian ſtates, except the Samnites and
                            Lucanians, were admitted into the boſom of the republic, and ſoon
                            contributed to the ruin of public freedom. When the popular aſſemblies
                            had been ſuppreſſed by the adminiſtration of the emperors, the
                            conquerors were diſtinguiſhed from the vanquiſhed nations only as the
                            firſt and moſt honourable order of ſubjects; and their increaſe, however
                            rapid·, was no longer expoſed to the ſame dangers. Yet the princes who
                            adopted the maxims of Auguſtus, guarded with the ſtricteſt care the
                            dignity of the Roman name, and diffuſed the freedom of the city with a
                            prudent liberality.</p>
                        <p>“ Till the privileges of the Romans had been progreſſively extended to
                            all the inhabitants of the empire, an important diſtinction was
                            preſerved between Italy and the provinces. The eſtates of the Italians
                            were exempted from taxes, and their perſons from the arbitrary
                            juriſdiction of governors. From the foot of the Alps to the extremity of
                            Calabria, all the natives of Italy were born citizens of Rome. The
                            provinces of the empire were deſtitute of any public force or
                            conſtitutional freedom. The free ſtates and cities, which had embraced
                            the cauſe of Rome, were inſenſibly ſunk into real ſervitude. The public
                            authority was everywhere engroſſed by the mi-niſters of the ſenate and
                            of the emperors, and that authority was abſolute. But the ſame ſalutary
                            maxims of government which had ſecured the peace and obedience of Italy,
                            were extended to the moſt diſtant conqueſts. A nation of Romans was
                            gradually formed in the provinces, by the double expedient of
                            introducing colonies, and of admitting the moſt faithful and deſerving
                            provincials to the freedom of Rome.</p>
                        <p>“ So ſenſible were the Romans of the influence of language over national
                            manners, that it was their moſt ſe-rious care to extend, with the
                            progreſs of their arms, the uſe of the Latin tongue. The eaſtern
                            provinces, however, were leſs docile in this reſpect than the weſtern
                            ones; and this, obvious difference made a diſtinction between the two
                            portions of the empire, which became very remarkable when it began to
                            decline. Nor was the influence of the Greek language and ſentiments
                            confined to the narrow limits of that once celebrated country. Their
                            em-pire, by the progreſs of colonies and conqueſt, had been diffuſed
                            from the Adriatic to the Euphrates and Nile. Aſia was covered with Greek
                            cities, and the long reign of the Macedonian kings had introduced a
                            ſilent revolution into Syria and Egypt. In their pompous courts, thoſe
                            princes united the elegance of Athens with the luxury of the eaſt; and
                            the example of the court was imitated, at an humble diſtance, by the
                            higher ranks of their ſubjects. Such was the general diviſion of the
                            Roman empire into the Latin and Greek languages; to which we may add a
                            third diſtinction for the body of the natives in Syria, and eſpecially
                            in Egypt. The uſe of their ancient dialects, by ſecluding them from the
                            commerce of mankind, checked the improvements of theſe barbarians. The
                            ſlothful effeminacy of the former expoſed them to the contempt, the
                            fullen ferociouſneſs of the latter excited the averſion, of the Roman
                            conquerors. They ſeldom deſired or deſerved the freedom of the city; and
                            it is remarked, that more than 230 years elapſed after the ruin of the
                            Ptolemies, before a native Egyptian was admitted into the ſenate of
                            Rome.</p>
                        <p>“ The number of ſubjects who acknowledged the laws of Rome, of citizens,
                            of provincials, and of ſlaves, cannot now- be fixed with ſuch accuracy
                            as the importance of the object would deſerve. We are informed, that
                            when the emperor Claudius exerciſed the office of cenfor, he took an
                            account of 6, 945, 000 Roman citizens; who, with the proportion of women
                            and children, muſt have amounted to about 20, 000, 000 of ſouls. The
                            multitude of ſubjects of an inferior rank was uncertain and fluctuating:
                            but after weighing with attention every circumſtance which could
                            influence the balance, it ſeems probable that there exiſted, in the time
                            of Claudius, about twice as many provincials as there were Roman
                            citizens, of either ſex, and of every age; and that the ſlaves were at
                            leaſt equal in number to the free inhabitants of the Roman world. The
                            total amount of this imperfect calculation would riſe to about 120
                            millions of perſons; a degree of population which poſſibly exceeds that
                            of modern Europe, and forms the moſt numerous ſociety that has ever been
                            united under the ſame ſyſtem of government.</p>
                        <p>“ Domeſtic peace and union were the natural conſequences of the moderate
                            and comprehenſive policy embraced by the Romans. The vanquiſhed nations,
                            blended into one great people, reſigned the hope, nay even the wiſh, of
                            reſuming their independence, and ſcarcely conſidered their own exiſtence
                            as diſtinct from the exiſtence of Rome. The eſtabliſhed authority of the
                            emperors pervaded, without an effort, the wide extent of their
                            dominions, and was exerciſed with the ſame facility on the banks of the
                            Thames, or of the Nile, as on thoſe of the Tiber. The legions were
                            deſtined to ſerve againſt the public enemy, and the civil magiſtrate
                            ſeldom required the aid of a military force.</p>
                        <p>“ It was ſcarcely poſſible that the eyes of contemporaries ſhould
                            diſcover in the public felicity the latent cauſes of decay and
                            corruption. This long peace, and the uniform government of the Romans,
                            introduced a flow and ſecret poiſon into the vitals of the empire. The
                            minds of men were gradually reduced to the ſame level; the fire of
                            genius was extinguiſhed, and even the military ſpirit evaporated. The
                            natives of Europe were brave and robuſt. Spain, Gaul, Britain, and
                            Illyricum, ſupplied the legions with excellent ſoldiers, and conftituted
                            the <pb/> real ſtrength of the monarchy. Their perſonal valour remained;
                            but they no longer poſſeſſed that public courage which is nouriſhed by
                            the love of independence, the ſenſe of national honour, the preſence of
                            danger, and the habit of command. They received laws and governors from
                            the will of their ſovereign, and truſted for their defence to a
                            mercenary army. The poſterity of their boldeſt leaders were contented
                            with the rank of citizens and ſubjects. The moſt aſpiring ſpirits
                            reſorted to the court or ſtandard of the emperors; and the deſerted
                            provinces, deprived of political ſtrength or union, inſenſibly ſunk into
                            the languid indifference of private life.</p>
                        <p>“ The love of letters, almoſt inſeparable from peace and refinement, was
                            faſhionable among the ſubjects of Adrian and the Antonines; who were
                            themſelves men of learning and curioſity. It was diſſuſed over the whole
                            extent of their empire; the moſt northern tribes of Britons had acquired
                            a taſte for rhetoric; Homer as well as Virgil were tranſcribed and
                            ſtudied on the banks of the Rhine and Danube; and the moſt liberal
                            rewards ſought out the fainteſt glimmerings of literary merit. The
                            ſciences of phyſic and aſtronomy were cultivated with ſome degree of
                            reputation; but, if we except Lucian, an age of indolence paſſed away
                            without producing a ſingle writer of genius who deſerved the attention
                            of poſterity. The authority of Plato, of Ariſtotle, of Zeno, and
                            Epicurus, ſtill reigned in the ſchools; and their ſyſtems, tranſmitted
                            with blind deference from one generation of dif-ciples to another,
                            precluded every generous attempt to correct the erroιs or enlarge the
                            bounds of the human mind. The beauties of the poets and orators, inſtead
                            of kindling a fire like their own, produced only ſervile imitations; or,
                            if any ventured to deviate from theſe models, they deviated at the ſame
                            time ſrom good ſenſe and propriety. The provincials of Rome, trained by
                            an uniform artificial education, were engaged in a very unequal
                            competition with thoſe bold ancients, who, by expreſſing their genuine
                            feelings in their native tongue, had already occupied every place of
                            honour. The name of <hi rend="italic">poet</hi> was almoſt forgotten;
                            that of <hi rend="italic">orator</hi> was uſurped by the ſophiſts. A
                            cloud of critics, of compilers, of commentators, darkened the face of
                            learning, and the decline of genius was ſoon followed by the corruption
                            of taſte.</p>
                        <p>“ Longinus obſerves and laments the degeneracy of his contemporaries,
                            which debaſed their ſentiments, enervated their courage, and depreſſed
                            their talents; comparing them to pigmies, whoſe ſtature has been
                            diminiſhed by conſtant preſſure on their limbs. This diminutive ſtature
                            of mankind was conſtantly ſinking below the old ſtandard, and the Roman
                            world was indeed peopled by a race of pigmies; when the fierce giants of
                            the north broke in and mended the puny breed. They reſtored a manly
                            freedom; and, after the revolution of ten centuries, freedom became the
                            happy parent of taſte and ſcience. ”</p>

                <p>After the death of Marcus Aurelius, his ſon Commodus ſucceeded to the imperial

                    ſo prone to vice, that he was generally believed to have been the ſon, not of
                    Marcus Aurelius, but of a celebrated gladiator, with whom the empreſs</p>

                <p>Fairſtina was ſuppoſed to be intimate. According to Mr Gibbon, however, Commodus
                    was not, as has been repreſented, a tiger born with an inſatiate thirſt of human
                    blood, and capable from his infancy of the moſt inhuman actions. Nature had
                    formed him of a weak, rather than a wicked diſpofition. His ſimplicity and</p>

                <p>timidity rendered him the ſlave of his attendants, who gradually corrupted his
                    mind. His cruelty, which at firſt obeyed the dictates of others, degenerated
                    into habit, and at length became the ruling paſſion of his ſoul. ” But, however
                    this may be, it is certain that the actions of this emperor were flagitious
                    almoſt beyond</p>

                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0434" facs="gri_33125011196389_0440.tif"/>
                <p>a parallel. Many very ſtrange inſtances of his cruelty are related by the
                    ancients He is ſaid to have cut aſunder a corpulent man whom he ſaw walking
                    along the ſtreet; partly, to try his own ſtrength, in which he greatly excelled;
                    and partly, as he himſelf owned, out of curioſity, to ſee his entrails drop out
                    at once. He took pleaſure in cutting off the feet, and putting out the eyes, of
                    ſuch as he met in his rambles through the city; telling the former, after he had
                    thus maimed them, that now they belonged to the nation of <hi rend="italic">Monopodii;</hi> and the latter, that they were now become <hi rend="italic"
                        > Luſcinii,</hi> alluding to the word <hi rend="italic">luſcus, "</hi> one-eyed. ” Some he murdered becauſe they were negligently dreſſed; others,
                    becauſe they ſeemed to be trimmed with too much nicety. He pretended to great
                    ſkill in ſurgery, eſpecially at letting blood: but ſometimes, inſtead of eaſing
                    by that means thoſe whom he viſited, or who were prevailed upon to recur to him,
                    he cut off, by way of diverſion, their ears and noſes. His lewdneſs and
                    debaucheries were equally remarkable, and equally infamous. However, he is ſaid
                    to have been exceedingly well ſkilled in archery, and to have performed
                    incredible feats in that way. He excelled all men in ſtrength; and is ſaid to
                    have run an elephant through with his ſpear, and to have killed in the
                    amphitheatre too lions, one after another, and each of them at one blow.
                    Forgetful of his dignity, he entered the lilts with the common gladiators, and
                    came off conqueror 735 times; whence he often ſubſcribed himſelf in his letters, <hi rend="italic">the conqueror of</hi> 1000 <hi rend="italic">gladiators.</hi></p>
                <p>The public tranſactions of this reign were but very few. Soon after his father’s
                    death, Commodus concluded a peace with the Marcommanni, Quadi, &amp;c. on the
                    following conditions. 1. That they ſhould not ſettle within five miles of the
                    Danube. 2. That they ſhould deliver up their arms, and ſupply the. Romans with a
                    certain number of troops when required. 3. That they ſhould aſſemble but once a
                    month, in one place only, and that in preſence of a Roman centurion. 4. That
                    they ſhould not make war upon the Ja-zyges, Buri, or Vandals, without the
                    conſent of the people of Rome. On the other hand, Commodus promiſed to abandon,
                    which accordingly he did, all the caſtles and fortreſſes held by the Romans in
                    their country, excepting ſuch as were within five miles of the Danube. With the
                    other German nations, whom his father had almoſt entirely reduced, he concluded
                    a very diſhonourable peace; nay, of ſome he purchaſed it with large ſums of

                <p>Soon after the return of the emperor to Rome, his ſiſter Lucilla, perceiving
                    that he was univerſally abhorred on account of his cruelty, formed a conſpiracy
                    againſt his life. Among the conſpirators were many ſenators of diſtinction. It
                    was agreed among them that they ſhould fall upon the emperor while he was going
                    to the amphitheatre through a narrow and dark paſſage; and that Olaudius
                    Pompeianus, to whom Lucilla had betrothed her daughter, ſhould give the firſt
                    blow. But he, inſtead of ſtriking at once, ſhowed him the naked dagger, and
                    cried out, “ This preſent the ſenate ſends you ſo that the guards had time to
                    reſcue the emperor, and to ſeize the conſpirators, who were ſoon after put to
                    death. The emperor baniſhed his ſiſter to the iſland of Capreæ, where he ſoon

                <p>rennis; who in oppreſſion and cruelty ſeems to have been nothing inferior to
                    thoſe of the moſt tyrannical emperors. During the firſt part of the reign of
                    Commodus, he ruled with an abſolute ſway; but at laſt was torn in pieces by the
                    enraged ſoldiery, whom he had offended by his too great ſeverity. He was
                    ſucceeded in his place by a freedman named <hi rend="italic">Cleander;</hi> for the emperor himſelf was ſo much taken up with his plea-lures, that he could
                    not beſtow even a moment on the affairs of ſtate. The new miniſter abuſed his
                    power in a more flagrant manner than even his predeceſſor lutd done. By him all
                    things were openly ſet to ſale; offices, provinces, public revenues, juſtice,
                    and the lives of men both innocent and guilty. The miniſter, who ruled the
                    emperor without controul, infuſed ſuch terrors into his timorous mind, that he
                    changed the captains of his guards almoſt continually. One Niger enjoyed the
                    dignity only fix hours; another only five days; and ſeveral others a ſtill
                    ſhorter ſpace. Moſt of thoſe officers loſt their lives along with their
                    employments; being accuſed of treaſon by Cleander, who continually ſolicited,
                    and at laſt obtained, that important poſt for himſelf.</p>
                <p>In the year 187 happened a remarkable revolt. One Maternus, a common ſoldier,
                    having fled from his colours, and being joined by many others guilty of the ſame
                    crime, grew in a ſhort time ſo powerful, the banditti flocking to him from all
                    parts, that he over-ran and plundered great part of Gaul and Spain ; ſtormed the
                    ſtrongeſt cities ; and ſtruck the emperor and people of Rome with ſuch terror,
                    that troops were raiſed, and armies diſpatched againſt him. Peſcennius Niger was
                    ſent to make head againſt him in Gaul, where he became very intimate with
                    Severus, who was then governor of Lyons, and who wrote a letter to the emperor,
                    commending the prudent and gallant behaviour of Niger in purſuing the rebels.
                    Maternus, finding himſelf reduced to great ſtraits, divided his men into ſeveral
                    ſmall bands, and marched privately with them by different ways into Italy ;
                    having nothing leſs in view than to murder the emperor during the ſolemnity
                    which was kept annually in honour of the mother of the gods, and on his death to
                    ſeize upon the empire for himſelf. They all arrived at Rome undiſcovered ; and
                    ſeveral of his men had already mixed themſelves with the emperor’s guards, when
                    others of his own party betrayed him. He was immediately ſeized and executed ;
                    and his death put an end to the diſturbances which ſome of his followers had
                    begun to raiſe in other provinces. In the ſame year broke out the moſt dreadful
                    plague, ſays Dio Caſſius, that had been known. It laſted two or three years ;
                    and raged with the greateſt violence at Rome, where it frequently earned off
                    2000 perſons a-day. The following year a dreadſul fire, which conſumed a great
                    part of the city, was kindled by lightning ; and at the ſame time the people
                    were afflicted with a dreadſul famine, occaſioned, according to ſome authors, by
                    Cleander, who, having now in view nothing leſs than the ſovereignty itſelf,
                    bought up underhand all the corn, in order to raiſe the price of it, and gain
                    tire affections of the ſoldiery and people by diſtributing it among them. Others
                    tell us, however, that Papirius Dionyſius, whoſe province it was to ſupply the
                    city with profilions, 'contributed towards the famine, in order to make the
                    people riſe againſt Cleander. Be this as it will, the populace aſcribed all
                    their calamities to this hated miniſter; and one day, while the people were
                    celebrating the Circaſſian games, a troop of children, having at their head a
                    young woman of an extraordinary ſtature and fierce aſpect, entering the circus,
                    began to utter aloud many bitter invectives and dreadful curſes againſt Cleander
                    ; which being for ſome time anſwered by the people with other invectives and
                    curſes, the whole multitude roſe all of a ſudden, and flew to the place where
                    Cleander at that time reſided with the emperor. There, renewing their
                    invectives, they demanded the head of the miniſter who had been the occaſion of
                    ſo many calamities. Hereupon Cleander ordered the prætorian cavalry to charge
                    the multitude ; which they did accordingly, driving them with great ſlaughter
                    into the city. But the populace diſeharging ſhowers of ſtones, bricks, and
                    tiles, lrom the tops of the houſes and from the windows, and the city-guards at
                    the ſame time taking part with the people, the prætorian horſe were ſoon obliged
                    to ſave themſelves by flight : nor was the ſlaughter ended till the emperor,
                    appriſed of the tumult, cauſed the head of Cleander to be ſtruck off and thrown
                    out to the enraged populace. The emperor himſelf did not long ſurvive Cleander ;
                    being cut off' by a conſpiracy of Marcia his favourite concubine, Lætus captain
                    of the guards, and Eclectus his chamberlain..</p>
                <p>No ſooner was the death of Commodus known, than the ſenate aſſembled, and
                    declared him a public enemy, loading him with curſes, ordering his ſtatues to be
                    broken to pieces, and his name to be raſed out of all public inſeriptions ; and
                    demanded his body, that it might be dragged through the ſlreets, and thrown into
                    the Tiber. But Helvius Pertinax, whom the conſpirators had previouſly deſigned
                    for the empire, and who had already aſſumed it, prevented ſuch an outrage, by
                    letting the ſenators know that Commodus was already buried. This extraordinary
                    perſonage had paſſed through many changes of fortune. He was originally the ſon
                    of an enfranchiſed ſlave, called <hi rend="italic">Ælius,</hi> who only gave
                    him ſo much learning as to qualify him for keeping a little ſhop in the city. He
                    then became a ſchoolmaſter, afterwards ſtudied the law, and after that became a
                    ſoldier; in which ſtation his behaviour was ſuch as cauſed him to be ſoon made
                    Captain of a cohort againſt the Parthians. Being thus introduced to arms he went
                    through the uſual gradation of military preferment in Britain and Mæfia, until
                    he became the commander of a legion under Aurelius. In this ſtation he performed
                    ſuch excellent ſervices againſt the barbarians, that he was made conſul, and
                    ſucceſe ſively governor of Dacia, Syria, and Aſia Minor. In the reign of
                    Commodus he was baniſhed; but ſoon after recalled, and font into Britain to
                    reform the abuſes in the army. In this employment his uſual extraordinary
                    fortune attended him : he was oppoſed by a ſedition among the legions, and left
                    for dead among many others that were ſlain. However, he got over this danger,
                    ſeverely puniſhed the mutineers, and eſtabliſhed regularity and diſcipline among
                    the troops he was ſent to command. From thence he was removed into Africa, where
                    the ſedition of the ſoldiers had like to have been as fatal to him as in his
                    former government. Removing from Africa, and fatigued with an active liſe, he
                    betook himſelf to retirement : but Commodus,</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0436" facs="gri_33125011196389_0442.tif"/>
                <p>willing to keep him ſtill in view, made him prefect of the city ; which
                    employment he filled, when the conſpirators fixed upon him as the propereſt
                    perſon to ſucceed to the empire.</p>
                <p>His being advanced by Commodus only ſerved to increaſe his fears of falling as
                    an object of his ſuſpi-eions ; when therefore the conſpirators repaired to his
                    houſe by night, he conſidered their arrival as a command from the emperor for
                    his death. Upon Lætus entering his apartment, Pertinax, without any ſhow of
                    fear, cried out, That for many days he had expected to end his liſe in that
                    manner, wondering that the emperor had deferred it ſo long. However, he was not
                    a little ſurpriſed when informed of the real cauſe oſ their viſit ; and being
                    ſtrongly urged to accept of the empire, he at laſt complied with their offer.</p>
                <p>Being carried to the camp, Pertinax was proclaimed emperor : ſoon after the
                    citizens and ſenate conſented ; the joy for the election of a new ſovereign
                    being ſcarce equal to that for the death of the former. The provinces quickly
                    followed the example of Rome ; ſo that he began his reign with univerſal
                    ſatisſaction to the whole empire, in the 68th year of his age.</p>
                <p>Nothing could exceed the wiſdom and juſtice of this monarch’s reign the ſhort
                    time it continued. He puniſhed all thoſe who had ſerved to corrupt the late
                    emperor, and diſpoſed of his ill-got poſſeſſions to public uſes. He attempted to
                    reſtrain the licentiouſneſs of the prætorian bands, and put a ſtop to the
                    injuries and inſolences they committed againſt the people. He ſold moſt of the
                    buffoons and jeſters of Commodus as ſlaves; particularly ſuch as had obſcene
                    names. He continually frequented the ſenate as often as it ſat, and never
                    refuſed an audience even to the meaneſt of the people. His ſucceſs in foreign
                    affairs was equal to his internal policy. When the barbarous nations abroad had
                    certain intelligence that he was emperor, they immediately laid down their arms,
                    well knowing the oppoſition they were to expect from ſo experienced a commander.
                    His great error was avarice ; and that, in ſome meaſure, ſerved to haften his
                    ruin.</p>
                <p>The prætorian ſoldiers, whoſe manners he had attempted to reform, having been
                    long corrupted by the indulgence and profuſion of their former monarchs, began
                    to hate him for the parſimony and diſcipline he had introduced among them. They
                    therefore reſolved to dethrone him ; and for that purpoſe declared Maternus, an
                    ancient ſenator, emperor, and endeavoured to carry him to the camp to proclaim
                    him. Maternus, however, was too juſt to the merits of Pertinax, and too faithful
                    a ſubject, to concur in their ſeditious designs ; wherefore eſcaping out of
                    their hands, he fled, firſt to the emperor, and then out of the city. They then
                    nominated one Falco, another ſenator ; whom the ſenate would have ordered for
                    execution, had not Pertinax interpoſed, who declared that daring his reign no
                    ſenator ſhould ſuffer death.</p>
                <p>'1 he prætorian ſoldiers then reſolved unanimouſly not to uſe any ſecret
                    conſpiracies, or private contrivances, but boldly to ſeize upon the emperor and
                    empire at once. They accordingly, in a tumultuous manner, marched through the
                    ſtreets of Rome, and entered the palace without oppoſition. Such was the terror
                    at their approach, that the greateſt part of the emperor ’s attendants forſook
                    hiift <hi rend="italic">j</hi> while theſe who remaiaed earnçit-</p>
                <p>ly intreated him to fly to the body of the people, and intereſt them in his
                    defence. However, he rejected their advice ; declaring, that it was unworthy his
                    imperial dignity, and all his paſt actions, to ſave himſelf by flight. Having
                    thus reſolved to face the rebels, he had ſome hopes that his preſence alone
                    would terrify and confound them. But what could his former virtues, or the
                    dignity of command, avail againſt a tumultuous rabble, nurſed up in vice, and
                    miniſters of former tyranny ? One Thauſius, a Tuagrian, ſtruck him with his
                    lance on the breaſt, crying out, “ The ſoldiers ſend you this.” Pertinax finding
                    all was over, covered his head with his robe, and ſunk down, mangled with a
                    multitude of wounds, which he received from various aſſaſſins. Eclectus, and
                    ſome more of his attendants, who attempted to defend him, were alſo ſlain : his
                    ſon and daughter only eſcaped, who happened to be lodged out of the palace.
                    Thus, after a reign of three mouths, Pertinax ſell a ſacriſice to the licentious
                    ſury of the prætorian army. From the number of his adventures, he was called the <hi rend="italic">tennis-ball of Fortune ;</hi> and certainly no man ever
                    experienced ſuch a variety of ſituations with ſo blameleſs a character.</p>
                <p>The ſoldiers having committed this outrage, retired with great precipitation ;
                    and getting out of the city to the reſt of their companions, expeditiouſly
                    fortified their camp, expecting to be attacked by the citizens. Two days having
                    paſſed without any attempt of this kind, they became more inſolent ; and willing
                    to make uſe of the power of which they found themſelves poſſeſſed, made
                    proclamation, that they would ſell the empire to whoever would purchaſe it at
                    the higheſt price, In conſequence of this proclamation, ſo odious and unjuſt,
                    only two bidders were found ; namely, Sulpicia-nus and Didius Julianus: The
                    former, a conſular perſon, prefect of the city, and ſon-in-law to the late
                    emperor Pertinax ; the latter, a Conſular perſon likewile <hi rend="sub">s</hi> a great lawyer, and the wealthieſt man in the city. He was ſitting with
                    ſome ſriends at dinner when the proclamation was publiſhed ; and being charmed
                    with the proſpect of unbounded power, immediately roſe ſrom tahle and haſtened
                    to the camp. Sulpicianus was got there before him ; but as he had rather
                    promiſes than treafore to beſtow, the offers of Didius, who produced immenſe
                    ſums of ready money, prevailed» He was received into the camp by a ladder, and
                    they inſtantly ſwore to obey him as emperor. From the camp he was attended by
                    his new electors into the city ; tire whole body of his guards, which conſiſted
                    of 10,000 men, ranged around him in ſuch order as if they had prepared for
                    battle, and not for a peaceful ceremony. The citizens, however, refuſed to
                    confirm his election ; but rather curſed him as he paſſed. Up-» on being
                    conducted to the ſenate-houſe, he addreſſed the few ſenators that were preſent
                    in a very laconic ſpeech : “ Fathers, you want an emperor ; and I am the ſitteft
                    perſon you can chooſe.” But even this, ihort as it ſeems, was unneceſſary, ſince
                    the ſenate had it not in their power to refuſe their approbation. His ſpeech
                    being backed by the army, to whom lie had given, about a million of our money,
                    ſucceeded. The choice of the ſoldiers was confirmed by the ſenate, and Didius
                    wag acknowledged emperor, now in the 57 th year of his. age.</p>
                <p>it ſhould ſeem by this weak monarch’s conduct when</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0437" facs="gri_33125011196389_0443.tif"/>
                <p>ſeated on the throne, that he thought the government of an empire rather a
                    pleaſure than a toil. Inſtead of attempting to gain the hearts of his ſubjects,
                    he gave himſelf up to eaſe and inactivity, utterly regardleſs oſ the duties of
                    his ſtation. He was mild and gentle indeed ; neither injuring any nor expecting
                    to be injured. But that avarice, by which he became opulent, ſtill followed him
                    in his exaltation ; ſo that the very ſoldiers who elected him, ſoon began to
                    deteſt him ſor thoſe qualities, ſo very oppoſite to a military character. The
                    people alſo, againſt whoſe conſent he was choſen, were no leſs inimical.
                    Whenever he iſſued from his palace, they openly poured forth their imprecations
                    againſt him ; crying out, that he was a thief, and had ſtolen the empire.
                    Didius, however, in the true ſpirit of a trader, patiently bore it all ;
                    ſometimes beckoning them with ſmiles to approach him, and teſtifying his regard
                    by every kind oi ſubmiflion.</p>
                <p>While Didius was thus contemptuouſly treated at home, two valiant generals, in
                    different parts of the empire, diſclaimed his authority, and boldly reſolved to
                    attempt the throne for themſelves. Theſe were, Peſe cenniιιs Niger, governor of
                    Syria ; and Septimius Severus, commander of the German legions. Niger was
                    beloved by the people for his clemency and valour; and the report of his
                    propoſing Pertinax for his model, and reſolving to revenge his death, gained him
                    univerſal eſteem among the people. Being thus appriſed of their inclinations, he
                    eaſily induced his army in Syria to proclaim him emperor ; and his title was,
                    ſhortly after, acknowledged by all the kings and potentates in Aſia, who ſent
                    their ambaſſadors to him as their lawful prince. The pleaſure of being thus
                    treated as a monarch, in ſome meaſure retarded his endeavours to ſecure his
                    title. Entirely ſatisfied with the homage of thoſe about him, he neglected the
                    opportunities of ſuppreffing his rivals ; and gave himſelf up to luxury and
                    feaſting at Antioch. The conduct of Severus, an African by birth, was very
                    different. Being proclaimed by his army, he began by promiſing to revenge the
                    death of Pertinax, and took upon him his name. He next ſecured the fidelity of
                    all the ſtrong places in his province ; and then reſolved, with the utmoſt
                    expedition, to march with his whole force directly to Rome.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, Didius, who diſregarded the attempts of Niger, was greatly
                    alarmed at thoſe of Severus. He firſt, with many ſolicitations, procured the
                    ſenate to proclaim him a traitor. He then applied himſelf to make the neceſſary
                    proviſions to oppoſe him, in which lie found nothing but diſappointment. The
                    cohorts that elected him were enervated by vice and luxury; the people deteſted
                    his cauſe; and the citie3 of Italy had long been difofed to the arts of war.
                    Some adviſed him to march forward, and meet Severus as he was croſſing the Alps
                    ; others were for ſending the generals upon that expedition. The unfortunate
                    Didius, unequal to the talk of empire, and quite confouneled with the
                    multiplicity of counſels, could take no other ιefolutio∙n but that of awaiting
                    his rival’s coming at Rome. Accordingly, ſoon after being informed of his
                    approach, he obtained the conſent of the ſenate to fend Ids, ambaſſadors,
                    offering to make him a partner of the empire. But Severus rejected this offer,
                    conſcious of his own ſtrength, and of the weakneſs of the propoſer. The ſenate
                    ſoon appeared of the ſarae ſentiments ; and</p>
                <p>perceiving the timidity and weakneſs of their preſent maſter, began to abandon
                    him, alleging, that he who could not defend the empire was not worthy to govern
                    it. Didins vainly endeavoured to reduce them to their duty, firſt by intreaties,
                    and then by threats; but theſe only ſerved to halfen his deſtruction. The ſenate
                    being called together, as was formerly practiſed in the times of the
                    commonwealth by the conſuls, they unanimouſly decreed, That Didius ſhould be
                    deprived of the empire, and that Severus ſhould be proclaimed in his ſtead. They
                    then commanded Didius to be ſlain ; and ſent meſſengers for this purpoſe to the
                    palace,· where they found him diſarmed, and weeping among a lew friends that
                    ſtill adhered to his intereſt. When· the executioners began to prepare for their
                    fatal errand, he expoſtulated with them, demanding what crime he had committed ?
                    He could not be perſuaded to think, that paying his money, and receiving an
                    empire in exchange, deſerved ſo ſevere a puniſhment. Ί he executioners, however,
                    were neither able nor willing to enter into the merits of the cauſe; they
                    preſently led him into the ſecret baths of the palace, and obliging him to
                    ſtretch his neck forwards, after the manner of condemned criminals, ſtruck off
                    his head, and placed it up in thoſe courts where he had formerly pleaded with
                    great ſucceſs.</p>
                <p>The ſenate having thus diſpatched Didius, ſent ambaſſadors to Severus, yielding
                    him obedience, granting him the enſigns and the uſual titles of empire, and
                    informing him of the death of Didius. Severus, who was now about 47 years of
                    age, received them with all proper reſpect ; and entertaining them honourably
                    continued his march towards Rome. As he came near the city, his firſt exertion
                    of power was, to have all the ρrastorian ſoldiers who had lately fold the empire
                    come forth unarmed to meet him. Tlieſe, though ſenſible of their danger, had no
                    other reſource left but compliance ; and accordingly came forward with branches
                    of « laurel, as if to welcome his approach. Severus, however, ſoon ſhowed how
                    little capable their preſent ſubmiſſion was to atone for their paſt offences :
                    after upbraiding them, in a ſhort ſpeech, with all their crimes, he commanded
                    them to be inſtantly ſtripped of their military habits, deprived of the name and
                    honour of ſoldiers, and baniſhed 100 miles from Rome. He then entered the city
                    in a military manner, took poſſeſſion of the palace, and promiſed the ſenate to
                    conduct himſelf with clemency and juſtice. However, though he united great
                    vigour with the moſt refined policy, yet his African cunning was conſidered as a
                    particular defect in him. He is celebrated for his wit, learning, and prudence ;
                    but equally blamed for infidelity and cruelty. In ſhort, he ſeemed alike
                    diſpoſed to the. peιformance of the gieateſt acts of virtue and the moſt bloody
                    ſeverities. He began his command, by ſeizing ail the children of ſuch as had
                    employments or authority in the eaſt, and detained them as pledges for their
                    fathers loy <hi rend="sup">r</hi> aky. He next ſupplied the city with corn j
                    and then with all poſſible expedition marched againſt. Niger, who was ſtill
                    conſidered and honoured as emperor of the eaſt.</p>
                <p>One of the chief obſtacles to his march was, the leaving behind him Clodius
                    Albinus, commander of the legions in Britain, whom he by all means wiſhed to
                    ſecure in his intereſts, Tor this end, he endeavoured to</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0438" facs="gri_33125011196389_0444.tif"/>
                <p>prevail upon him, by giving him hopes of ſucceeding to the empire ; inſinuating,
                    that he himſelf was declining, and his children were as yet but infants. To
                    deceive him ſtill farther, he wrote in the ſame ſtyle to the ſenate, gave him
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">Caſar.,</hi> and ordered money to be coined
                    with his image. Theſe artifices ſerving to lull Albimιs into falſe ſecurity,
                    Severus marched againſt Niger with all his forces. After ſome undeciſive
                    conflicts, the laſt great battle that was fought between theſe extraordinary men
                    was upon the plains of Iſſus, on the very ſpot where Alexander had formerly
                    conquered Darius. Beſides the two great armies drawn up on the plain, the
                    neighbouring mountains were covered with infinite numbers of people, who were
                    merely led by curioſity to become ſpectators of an engagement that was to
                    determine the empire of the world. Severus was conqueror ; and Niger’s head
                    being ſtruck off by ſome ſoldiers of the conquering army, was inſultingly
                    carried through the camp on the point of a lance.</p>
                <p>This victory ſecured Severus in the poſſeſſion of the throne. However, the
                    Parthians, Perſians, and ſome other neighbouring nations, took up arms, under a
                    pretence of vindicating Niger’s cauſe. The emperor marched againſt them in
                    perſon, had many engagements with them, and obtained ſuch ſignal victories over
                    them, as enlarged the empire, and eſtabliſhed peace in the eaſt.</p>
                <p>Niger being no more, Severus now turned his views againſt Albinus, whom he
                    reſolved by every means to deſtroy. For this purpoſe he ſent aſſaſſins into
                    Britain, under a pretence of bringing him letters, but in reality to diſpatch
                    him. Albinus being appriſed of their deſigns, prevented their attempt by
                    recurring to open force and proclaiming himſelf emperor. Nor was he without a
                    powerful army to ſupport his pretenſions ; of which Severus being ſenſible, bent
                    his whole force to oppoſe him. From the eaſt he continued his courſe acroſs the
                    ſtraits of Byzantium, into the moſt weſtern parts of Europe, without
                    intermiſſion. Albinus being informed of his approach, went over to meet him with
                    his forces into Gaul ; ſo that the campaign on both ſides was carried on with
                    great vigour. Fortune ſeemed for a while variable ; but at laſt a deciſive
                    engagement came on, which was one of the moſt deſperate recorded in the Roman
                    hiſtory. It laſted front morning till night, without any ſeeming advantage on
                    either ſide ; at length the troops of Severus began to fly, and he himſelf
                    happening to fall from his horſe, the army of Albinus cried out, Victory. But
                    the engagement was ſoon renewed with vigour by Lætus, one of Seve-rus’s
                    commanders, who came up with a body of reſerve, deſigning to deſtroy both
                    parties and make himſelf emperor. This attempt, though deſigned againſt both,
                    turned out entirely to the advantage of Severus. He therefore again charged with
                    fιich fury and exactneſs, that he ſoon plucked the victory from thoſe who but a
                    ſhort time before ſeemed conquerors ; and purſuing them into the city of Lyons,
                    took Albinus priſoner, and cut off his head ; treating his dead body with
                    inſults that could only flow from a mean and revengeſul temper. All the ſenators
                    who were ſlain in battle he ordered to be quartered, and ſuch as were taken
                    alive were immediately executed.</p>
                <p>Having thus ſecured himſelf in poſſeſſion of the empire, upon his return to Rome
                    he loaded his ſoldiers with rewards and honours ; giving them ſuch privileges as
                    ſtrengthened his own power, while they deſtroyed that of the ſtate. For the
                    ſoldiers, who had hitherto ſhowed the ſtrongeſt inclination to an abuſe of
                    power, were now made arbiters of the ſate of emperors ; and we ſhall
                    henceforward behold them ſetting them up, and dethroning them, at pleaſure.</p>
                <p>Being thus ſecure of his army, he reſolved to give way to his natural turn for
                    conqueſt, and to oppoſe his arms againſt the Parthians, who were then invading
                    the frontiers of the empire. Having therefore previouſly given the government of
                    domeſtic policy to one Plautianus, a particular favourite of his, to whoſe
                    daughter he married his ſon Caracalla, he ſet out for the eaſt, and proſecuted
                    the war with his uſual expedition and ſucceſs. He forced ſubmiſſion ſrom the
                    king of Armenia, deſtroyed ſeveral cities in Arabia Felix, landed on the
                    Parthian coaſts, took and plundered the famous city Cteſiphon, marched back
                    through Paleſtine and Egypt, and at length returned to Rome in triumph.</p>
                <p>During this interval, Plautianus, who was leſt to direct the affairs of Rome,
                    began to think of aſpiring to the empire himſelf. Upon the emperor’s return, he
                    employed a tribune of the prætorian cohorts, of which he was the commander, to
                    aſſaſſinate him, as likewiſe his ſon Caracalla. The tribune ſeemed cheerfully to
                    undertake this dangerous office ; but inſtead <hi rend="italic">of</hi> going
                    through with it, informed Severus of his favourite’s treachery. He at firſt
                    received it as an improbable ſtory, and as the artifice of ſome one who envied
                    his favourite’s fortune. However, he was at laſt perſuaded to permit the tribune
                    to conduct Plautianus to the emperor’s apartments. With this intent, the tribune
                    went and amuſed him with a pretended account of his killing the emperor and his
                    ſon, deſiring him, if he thought it lit to ſee them dead, to come with him to
                    the palace. As Plautianus ardently deſired their deaths, he readily gave credit
                    to this relation ; and following the tribune, he was conducted at midnight into
                    the innermoſt receſſes of the palace. But what miiſt have been his
                    diſappointment, when, inſtead of finding the emperor lying dead, as he expected,
                    he beheld the room lighted up with torches, and Severus, ſurrounded by his
                    friends, prepared in array to receive him. Being aſhed by the emperor, with a
                    ſtern countenance, what had brought him there at that unſeaſonable time ? he was
                    at firſt utterly confounded ; wherefore, not knowing what excuſe to make, he
                    ingenuouſly conſeſſed the whole, intreating forgiveneſs for what he had
                    intended. The emperor ſeemed in the beginning inclined to pardon ; but Caracalla
                    his ſon, who from the earlieſt age ſhowed a diſpoſition to cruelty, ſpurned him
                    away in the midſt of his ſupplications, and with his ſword ran him through the
                    body.</p>
                <p>Severus having eſcaped this danger, ſpent a conſiderable time in viliting ſome
                    cities in Italy, permitting none of his officers to ſell places of truſt or
                    dignity, and diſtributing juſtice with the ſtricteſt impartiality. He took ſuch
                    an exact order in managing his exchequer, that, notwithſtanding his great
                    expences, he left more money behind him than any of his predeceſſors. His armies
                    alſo were kept upon the moſt reſpectable footing ; ſo that he feared no
                    invaſion. Being equally attentive to the preſervation of all parts of the
                    empire, he reſolved to make his laſt expedition into Britain,</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0439" facs="gri_33125011196389_0445.tif"/>
                <p>where the Romans were in danger of being deſtroyed, or compelled to fly the
                    province. Wherefore, after appointing liis two ſons Caracalla and Geta joint
                    ſucceſſors in the empire, and taking them with him, he land’ ed in Britain, to
                    the great terror of ſuch as had drawn down his reſentment. Upon his progreſs
                    into the country, he left his ſon Geta in the ſouthern part of the province,
                    which had continued in obedience, and marched with his ſon Caracalla againſt the
                    Caledonians. In this expedition, his army ſuffered prodigious hardſhips in
                    purſuing the enemy ; they were obliged to hew their way through intricate
                    ſoreſts, to drain extenſive marſhes, and form bridges over rapid rivers ; ſo
                    that he loſt 50,000 men by fatigue and ſickneſs. However, he ſupported all theſe
                    inconveniences with the greateſt bravery ; and is ſaid to have proſecuted his
                    ſucceſſes with ſuch vigour, that he compelled the enemy to ſue for peace ; which
                    they obtained, not without the fur-render of a conſiderable part of their
                    country. We muſt here obſerve, however, that the Picts and Caledonians are ſo
                    often confounded together by hiſtorians, that many miſtakes have thence ariſen
                    concerning the progreſs and conqueſts of the Romans in the north of Britain. But
                    from the boundary formed by the famous wall of Severus (ſee <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps"> Sekfrus’s Wall),</hi></hi> we muſt con-lude, that no part of Caledonia, properly ſo called, had been
                    either on this or any other occaſion ceded to him.; and there is reaſon to
                    believe, that he rather received checks ſrom the people of that territory, than
                    was ever able to make any conſiderable impreſſion upon them. Be this, however,
                    as it may, after having made peace, and built his wall, he retired to York ;
                    where, partly through age and fatigue, and partly through grief at the
                    irreclaimable life of Caracalla, he found himſelf daily declining, having
                    already loſt the uſe of his ſeet. To add to the diſtreſs of his ſituation, he
                    was informed that the ſoldiers had revolted, and declared his ſon emperor. In
                    this exigence, he ſeemed once more to recal his natural vigour ; he got himſelf
                    immediately put into his litter, and commanded the new emperor, with the
                    tribunes and centurions, to be brought before him. Though all were willing to
                    court the favour of the young emperor, ſuch was the authority of Severus, that
                    none dared tα diſobey. They appeared before him confounded and trembling, and
                    implored pardon upon their knees. Upon which, putting his hand to his head, he
                    cried out, “ Know, that it is the head that governs, and not the feet.” However,
                    ſoon perceiving his diſorder to increaſe, and knowing that he could not outlive
                    it, he called for poiſon ; which being reſuſed him, he loaded his ſtomach with
                    food ; which not being able to digeſt, it ſoon brought him to his end, in the
                    56th year oſhis age, after an active though cruel reign of about 18 years.</p>
                <p>Caracalla and Geta being acknowledged as emperors by the army, began to ſhow a
                    mutual hatred to each other even before their arrival at Rome. Their only
                    agreement was, in reſolving to deify Severus their father ; but ſoon after, each
                    ſought to attach the ſenate and army to. bis own particular intereſt. They were
                    of very oppoſite diſpoſitions : Caracalla was fierce and cruel to an extreme
                    degree ; Geta was mild and. merciful; ſo that the city ſoon found the dangerous
                    effects of being governed by two princes of equal power and contrary
                    inclinations.</p>
                <p>But this oppoſition was of no long continuance; for . Caracalla being reſolved
                    to govern alone, furiouſly entered Gcta’s apartment, and, followed by ruffians,
                    (lew him in his mother’s arms. Having committed this deteſtable murder, he
                    iſſued with great haſte from the palace, crying out, That his brother would have
                    ſlain him ; and that he was obliged, in ſelf-deſence, to retaliate the intended
                    injury. He then took refuge among the prætorian cohorts, and in a pathetic tone
                    began to implore their aſſiſtance, ſtill making the ſame excuſe for his conduct.
                    To this he added a much more prevailing argument, promiſing to beſtow upon them
                    the largeſſes uſually given upon the election of new emperors, and diſtributing
                    among them almoſt all the treaſures which had been amaſſed by his father. By
                    ſuch perſuaſives the ſoldiers did not heſitate to proclaim him ſole emperor, and
                    to ſtigmatize the memory of his brother Geta as a traitor and an enemy to the
                    commonwealth. The ſenators were ſoon after induced, either through favour or
                    fear, to approve what had been done by the army : Caracalla wept for the death
                    of his brother whom he had ſlain ; and, to carry his hypocriſy to the utmoſt
                    extreme, ordered him to be adored as a god.</p>
                <p>Being now emperor, he went on to mark his courſe with blood. Whatever was done
                    by Domitian or Nero ſell ſhort of this monſter’s barbarities. Lætus, who firſt
                    adviſed him to murder his brother, was the firſt who fell a ſacriſice to his
                    jealouſy. His own wife Plau-tina followed. Papinian, the renowned civilian, was
                    beheaded for refuſing to write in vindication of his cruelty ; anſwering the
                    emperor’s requeſt, by obſerving, That it was much eaſier to commit a. parricide
                    than to defend it. He commanded all governors to be ſlain that his brother had
                    appointed ; and deſtroyed not leſs than 2000 perſons who had adhered to his
                    party. Whole nights were ſpent in the execution of his bloody decrees ; and the
                    dead bodies of people of all ranks were carried out of the city in carts, where
                    they were burnt in heaps, without any of the ceremonies of a funeral. Upon a
                    certain occaſion, he ordered his ſoldiers to ſet upon a crowded audience in the
                    theatre, only for diſcountenancing a charioteer whom ha happened to favour.
                    Perceiving himſelf hated by the people, he publicly ſaid, that he could inſure
                    his own ſafety though not their love; ſo that he neither valued their reproaches
                    nor feared their hatred.</p>
                <p>This ſafety which he ſo much built upon was placed in the protection of his
                    ſoldiers. He had exhauſted the treaſury, drained the provinces, and committed a
                    thouſand acts of rapacity, merely to keep them ſtedfaſt in his intereſts ; and
                    being diſpoſed to truſt himſelf with them particularly, he reſolved to lead them
                    upon a viſit through all the provinces of the empire. He firſt went into Germany
                    ; where, to oblige the natives, he dreſſed himſelf in the habit of their
                    country. From thence he travelled into Macedonia, where he pretended to be a
                    great admirer of Alexander the Great ; and among other extravagancies cauſed a
                    ſtatue of that monarch to be made with two faces; one of which reſembled
                    Alexander and the other himſelf. He was ſo corrupted by flattery, that he called
                    himſelf <hi rend="italic">Alexander-;</hi> walked as he was told that monarch
                    had walked ; and, like him, bent his head to one ſhoulder. Shortly after,
                    arriving at Leſſer Aſia and the ruins of Troy, as he</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0440" facs="gri_33125011196389_0446.tif"/>
                <p>was viewing the tomb of Achilles, he took it into his head to reſemble that
                    hero; and one of his ſreedmen happening to die at that time, he uſed the ſame
                    ceremonies that were performed at the tomb of Patroclus. Paſſing thence into
                    Egypt, he maſſacred in the moſt terrible manner the inhabitants of Alexandria,
                    on account of the ſatires they compoſed on him, as is related under the article
                    Alexandria</p>
                <p>Going from thence into Syria, he invited Artabanus king of Parthia to a
                    conference; deſiring his daughter in marriage, and promiſing him the moſt
                    honourable protection. In conſequence of this, that king met him on a ſpacious
                    plain, unarmed, and only attended with a vaſt concourſe of his nobles. This was
                    what Caracalla deſired. Regardleſs of his promiſe, or the law of nations, he
                    inſtantly ſurrounded him with armed troops, let in wild beaſts among his
                    attendants, and made a moſt terrible ſlaughter among them; Artabanus himſelſ
                    eſcaping with the utmoſt difficulty. For this vile treachery he obtained ſrom
                    the ſenate the ſurname of <hi rend="italic">Parthicus.</hi></p>
                <p>Upon his return towards Rome, it would ſeem as if his vices were inexhauſtible;
                    ſor having been guilty of parricide, he now reſolved to marry the mother of Geta
                    whom he had ſlain. It happened that one day ſeeing her drop her veil, which
                    diſcloſed her naked boſom, which was extremely beautiful, he told her, that he
                    would poſſeſs thoſe charms he beheld, if it were lawful. To this unnatural
                    requeſt ſhe heſitated not to anſwer, that he might enjoy all things who
                    poſſeſſed all. Whereupon, ſetting aſide all duty and reſpect for his deceaſed
                    ſather, he celebrated his nuptials with her in public, to tally diſregarding the
                    cenſures and the ſarcaſms of mankind.</p>
                <p>However, though he diſregarded ſhame, he was not inſenſible to fear. He was ever
                    uneaſy in the conſci-ouſneſs of being univerſally hated; and was continually
                    conſulting aſtrologers concerning what death he ſhould die. Among others, he
                    ſent one of his confidants, named <hi rend="italic">Maternianus,</hi> with
                    orders to conſult all the aſtrolo-gers in the city concerning his end.
                    Maternianus conſidered this as a proper time to get rid of Macrinus, the
                    emperor’s principal commander in Meſopotamia; a man who was daily ſupplanting
                    him in his maſter’s favour. He therefore informed him by letter, as if from the
                    aſtrologers, that Macrinus had a deſign againſt his liſe; and they conſequently
                    adviſed him to put the conſpirator to death. This letter was ſent ſealed, and
                    made up, amongſt many others, to be conveyed with the greater ſecrecy, and
                    delivered to the emperor as he was preparing for a chariot race. However, as it
                    never was his cuſtom to interrupt his pleaſures for his buſineſs, he gave the
                    packet to Macrinus to read over, and to inform him of the contents when more at
                    leiſure. In peruſing theſe letters, when Macrinus came to that which regarded
                    himſelf, he was unable to contain his ſurpriſe and terror. His firſt care was,
                    to reſerve the fetter in queſtion to himſelf, and to acquaint the emperor only
                    with the ſubſtance of the reſt. He then ſet about the moſt probable means of
                    compaſſing his death, by which alone he could expect any ſafety. At length he
                    determined to apply to one Martialis, a man ofgreat ſtrength, and a centurion of
                    the guards, who hated the emperor from various motives; particularly for the
                    death of a brother, whom Caracalla had ordered to be ſlain. Him therefore
                    Macrinus exhorted to revenge his brother’s death, by killing the tyrant, which
                    he might eaſily effect, as being always ſo near his perſon Martialis readily
                    undertook the dangerous taſk; being willing to meet death himſelf, ſo he might
                    obtain his deſire of ſeeing the tyrant expire before him. Accordingly, as the
                    emperor was riding out one day near a little city called <hi rend="italic">Carra,</hi> he happened to withdraw himſelf privately, upon a natural
                    occaſion, with only one page to hold his horſe. This was the opportunity
                    Martialis had ſo long and ardently deſired; wherefore running to him as if he
                    had been called, he ſtabbed the emperor in the back, ſo that he died
                    immediately. Martialis unconcernedly returned to his troop; but retiring by
                    inſenſible degrees, he endeavoured to ſecure himſelf by flight. But his
                    companions ſoon miſſing him, and the page giving information of what had been
                    done, he was purſued by the German horſe and cut in pieces.</p>
                <p>During the reign of this execrable tyrant, which continued ſix years, the empire
                    was every day declining; the ſoldiers were entirely maſters of every election;
                    and as there were various armies in different parts, ſo there were as many
                    intereſts all oppoſite to each other. Caracalla, by ſatisfying their moſt
                    unreaſonable appetites, deſtroyed all diſcipline among them, and all
                    ſubordination in the ſtate.</p>
                <p>The ſoldiers, now without an emperor, after a ſuſpenſe of two days, fixed upon
                    Macrinus, who took all poſſible methods to conceal his being privy to
                    Caracalla’s murder. The ſenate confirmed their choice ſhortly after; and
                    likewiſe that of his ſon Diadumenus, whom he took as a partner in the empire.
                    Macrinus was 53 years old when he entered upon the government of the empire. He
                    was of obſcure parentage; ſome ſay by birth a Moor, who by the mere rotation of
                    office, being firſt made prefect of the prætorian bands, was now, by treaſon and
                    accident, called to fill the throne. We are told but little of this emperor,
                    except his engaging in a bloody though undecided battle with Artabanus king of
                    Parthia, who came to take vengeance for the injury he had ſuſtained in the late
                    reign: however, this monarch finding his real enemy dead, was content to make
                    peace, and returned into Parthia. Something is alſo ſaid of the ſeverity of this
                    emperor’s diſcipline; ſor to ſuch a pitch of licentiouſneſs was the Roman army
                    now arrived, that the moſt ſevere puniſhments were unable to reſtrain the
                    ſoldiers; and yet the moſt gentle inflictions were looked upon as ſeverity. It
                    was this rigorous diſcipline, together with the artifices of Mæſa, grandmother
                    to Heliogabalus the natural ſon of Caracalla, that cauſed the emperor’s ruin.
                    Heliogabalus was prieſt of a temple dedicated to the Sun, in Emeſa, a city of
                    Phoenicia; and though but 14 years old was greatly loved by the army for the
                    beauty of his perſon, and the memory of his father, whom they ſtill conſidered
                    as their greateſt benefactor. This was ſoon perceived by the grandmother 5 who
                    being very rich in gold and jewels, gave liberal preſents among them, while they
                    frequently repaired to the temple, both from the garriſon in the city and the
                    camp of Macrinus. This intercourſe growing every day more frequent, the
                    ſoldiers, being diſguſted with the ſeverities of their preſent emperor, began to
                    think of placing Heliogabalus in his ſtead. Accordingly, ſending for him</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0441" facs="gri_33125011196389_0447.tif"/>
                <p>to their camp, he was immediately proclaimed; and ſuch were the hopes of his
                    virtues, that all men began to affect his intereſts.</p>
                <p>Macrinus, who at this time was purſuing his pleaſures at Antioch, gave but
                    little attention to the firſt report ; only ſending his lieutenant Julian, with
                    ſome legions, to quell the inſurrection. However, theſe, like the reſt, ſoon
                    declared for Heliogabalus, and flew their general. It was then that Macrinus
                    found he had treated the rebellion too ſlightly ; he therefore reſolved, with
                    his ſon, to march directly againſt the ſeditious legions, and force them to
                    their duty. Both parties met on the confines of Syria : the battle was for ſome
                    time furious and obſtinate ; but at laſt Macrinus was overthrown, and obliged to
                    ſeek ſafety by flight. His principal aim was to get to Rome, where he knew his
                    preſence was deſired ; wherefore he travelled through the provinces of Aſia
                    Minor with the utmoſt expedition and privacy, but unfortunately ſell ſick at the
                    city of Chalcedon. There thoſe who were ſent in purſuit, overtook and put him to
                    death, together with his ſon Diadumenus, after a ſhort reign of one year and two
                    months.</p>
                <p>The ſenate and citizens of Rome being obliged to ſubmit to the appointment of
                    the army as uſual, Heliogabalus aſcended the throne at the age of 14. One at ſo
                    early an age, inveſted with unlimited power, and fur-rounded with flatterers,
                    could be expected to act only as they thought proper to direct. This young
                    emperor was entirely led by them ; and being ſenſible that it was in his power
                    to indulge all his appetites, he ſtudied only their gratification. As he is
                    deſcribed by hiſtorians, he appears a monſter of ſenſuality. His ſhort liſe
                    therefore is but a tiſſue of effeminacy, luſt, and extravagance. He married, in
                    the ſmall ſpace of four years, ſix wives, and divorced them all. He built a
                    temple to the ſun ; and willing that his god ſhould have a wife as well as
                    himſelf, he married him to Pallas, and ſhortly after to the moon. His palace was
                    a place of rendezvous for all the proſtitutes of Rome, whom he frequently met
                    naked, calling them <hi rend="italic">his fellow ſoldiers, and companions in
                        the field.</hi> He was ſo fond of the ſex, that he carried his mother with
                    him to the ſenate-houſe, and demanded that ſhe ſhould always be preſent when
                    matters of importance were debated. He even went ſo far as to build a
                    ſenate-houſe for women, with ſuitable orders, habits, and diſtinctions, of which
                    his mother was made preſident. They met ſeveral times ; all their debates
                    turning upon the faſhions of the day, and the different formalities to be uſed
                    in giving and receiving viſits. To theſe follies, he added great cruelty and
                    boundleſs prodigality ; ſo that he was heard to ſay, that ſuch diſhes as were
                    cheaply obtained were ſcarce worth eating. His ſuppers therefore generally coſt
                    6000 crowns, and oſten 60,000. He was always dreſſed in cloth of gold and
                    purple, enriched with precious ſtones, and yet never wore the ſame habit twice.
                    His palace, his chambers, and his beds, were all furniſhed of the richeſt
                    ſtuffs, covered with gold and jewels. Whenever he took horſe, all the way
                    between his apartment and the place of mounting was covered with gold and ſilver
                    duſt ſtrewn at his approach.</p>
                <p>Theſe exceſſes were ſoon perceived by his grandmother Mæfa , whoſe intrigues had
                    firſt raiſed him to the throne ; ſo that ſhe thought to leſſen his power by di-</p>
                <p>viding it. Tor this purpoſe, under a pretence of freeing him from the cares of
                    public buſineſs, ſhe perſuaded him to adopt his couſin-german, Alexander, as his
                    ſucceffor ; and likewiſe to make him his partner in the conſulſhip.
                    Heliogabalus, having thus raiſed his couſin, had ſcarce given him his power,
                    when he wiſhed again to take it away ; but the virtues of this young prince had
                    ſo greatly endeared the people and the army to him, that the attempt had like to
                    have been fatal to the tyrant himſelf. The prætorian ſoldiers mutinying,
                    attempted to kill him as he was walking in his gardens; but he eſcaped, by
                    hiding himſelf from their fury. However, upon returning to their camp, they
                    continued the ſedition ; requiring that the emperor ſhould remove ſuch perſons
                    from about him as oppreſſed the ſubject, and contributed to contaminate him.
                    They required alſo the being permitted to guard the young prince themſelves, and
                    that none of the emperor’s favourites or familiars ſhould ever be permitted to
                    con-verſe with him. Heliogabalus was reluctantly obliged to comply ; and
                    conſcious of the danger he was in, made preparations for death, when it ſhould
                    arrive, in a manner truly whimſical and peculiar. He built a lofty tower with
                    ſteps of gold and pearl, from whence to throw himſelf headlong in caſe of
                    neceſſity. He alſe prepared cords of purple ſilk and gold to ſtrangle himſelf
                    with ; he provided golden ſwords and daggers te ſtab himſelf with ; and poiſon
                    to be kept in boxes of emerald, in order to obtain what death he choſe beſt Thus
                    ſearing all things, but particularly ſuſpſeious of the deſigns of the ſenate, he
                    baniſhed them all out of the city : he next attempted to poiſon Alexander, and
                    ſpread a report of his death ; but perceiving the ſoldiers begin to mutiny, he
                    immediately took him in his chariot to the canrp, where he experienced a freſh
                    mortification, by finding all the acclamations of the army directed only to his
                    ſucceſſor. This not a little raiſed his indignation, and excited his deſire of
                    revenge. He returned towards the city, threatening the moſt ſevere puniſhments
                    againſt thoſe who had diſpleaſed him, and meditating freſh cruelties. However,
                    the ſoldiers were unwilling to give him time to put his deſigns in execution :
                    they followed him directly to his palace, purſued him from apartment to
                    apartment, and at laſt found him concealed in a privy ; a ſituation very
                    different from that in which he expected to die. Having dragged him from thence
                    through the ſtreets, with the moſt bitter invectives, and having diſpatched him,
                    they attempted once more to ſqueeze his pampered body into a privy; but not
                    eaſily effecting this, they threw it into the Tiber, with heavy weights, that
                    none might afterwards find or give it burial. This was the miſerable and
                    ignominious death of Heliogabalus, in the 18th year of his agc, after a
                    deteſtable reign of four years. His mother alſo was ſlain at the ſame time by
                    the ſoldiers ; as were alſo many of the opprobrious aſſociates of his criminal
                    pleaſures.</p>
                <p>Alexander being, without oppoſition, declared emperor, the ſenate, in their
                    uſual method of adulation, were for conferring new titles upon him ; but he
                    modeſtly declined them all, alleging, that titles were only honourable when
                    given to virtue, not to ſtation. This outſet was an happy omen of his future
                    virtues ; and few princes in hiſtory have been more commended by his
                    contemporaries, or indeed more deſerved commenda-</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0442" facs="gri_33125011196389_0448.tif"/>
                <p>tion. To the moſt rigid juſtice he added the greateſt humanity. He loved the
                    good, and was a ſevere reprover of the lewd and infamous. His accompliſhments
                    were equal to his virtues. He was an excellent mathematician, geometrician, and
                    muſician ; he was equally ſhilled in painting and ſculpture; and in poetry few
                    of his time could equal him. In ſhort, ſuch were his talents, and ſuch the
                    ſolidity of his judgment, that though but 16 years of age, he was conſidered as
                    a wiſe old man.</p>
                <p>The firſt part of his reign was ſpent in a reformation of the abuſes of his
                    predeceſſor. He reſtored the ſenators to their rank ; nothing being undertaken
                    without the moſt ſage adviſers, and moſt mature deliberation. Among the number
                    of his adviſers was his mother Mammæa ; a woman eminent for her virtues and
                    accompliſhments, and who made uſe of her power as well to ſecure her ſon the
                    affections of his ſubjects, as to procure them the moſt juſt adminiſtration. He
                    was a rigid puniſher of ſuch magiſtrates as took bribes, ſaying, That it was not
                    enough to deprive ſuch of their places j for their truſts being great, their
                    lives, in moſt caſes, ought to pay for a breach of them. On the contrary, he
                    thought he could never ſufficiently reward ſuch as had been remarkable for their
                    juſtice and inte-' g <hi rend="sup">rit</hi> y&gt; keeping a regiſter of
                    their names, and ſometimes aſhing ſuch of them as appeared modeſt and unwilling
                    to approach him, why they were ſo backward in demanding their reward, and why
                    they ſuffered him to be in their debt ? His clemency extended even to the
                    Chriſtians, who had been puniſhed in the former reigns with unrelenting
                    barbarity. Upon a conteſt between them and a company of cooks and vintners,
                    about a .piece of public ground, which the one claimed as a place ſor public
                    worſhip, and the other for exerciſing their reſpective trades, he decided the
                    point by his re-icript, in theſe words : “ It is better that God be wor-ſhipped
                    there in any manner, than that the place ſhould</p>
                <p>be put to uſes of drunkenneſs and debauchery.”</p>
                <p>His abilities in -war were not inferior to his aſſiduity in peace. The empire,
                    which from the remiſſneſs and debauchery of the preceding reigns now began to be
                    attacked on every ſide, wanted a perſon of vigour and conduct to defend it.
                    Alexander faced the enemy wherever the invaſion was moſt formidable, and for a
                    ſhort time deferred its *uirι. His firſt expedition, in the tenth year of his
                    reign, was againſt the Parthians and Perſians, whom he oppoſed with a powerſul
                    army.—∙ The Perſians were routed in a deciſive engagement with great ſlaughter ;
                    the cities of Cteſiphon and Babylon were once more taken, and the Roman empire
                    was re-ftored to its former limits. Upon his return to Antioch, his mother
                    Mammæa ſent for the famous Origen, to be inſtructed by him in the principles of
                    Chriſe tianity ; and after diſcourſing with him for ſome time upon the ſubject,
                    diſmiſſed him, with a proper ſafe-guard, to his ſiative city of Alexandria.
                    About the ſame time that Alexander was victorious in the Eaſt, Furius Celſus,
                    his general, obtained a ſignal victory over the Mauritanians in Africa. Varius
                    Macrinus was ſucceſsful in Germany, and Junius Palmatus returned with conqueſt
                    from Armenia. However, the number of theſe victories only haſtened the decline
                    of the empire, which was waſted by the exertion of its own</p>
                <p>ſtrength, and was now becoming little more than a ſplendid ruin.</p>
                <p>About the 13th year of his reign, the Upper Germans, and other northern nations,
                    began to pour down immenſe ſwarms of people upon the more ſouthern parts of the
                    empire. They paſſed the Rhine and the Danube with ſuch fury, that all Italy was
                    thrown into the moſt extreme conſternation. The emperor, ever ready to expoſe
                    himſelf for the ſafety of his people, made what levies he could, and went in
                    perſon to ſtern the torrent ; which he ſpeedily effected. It was in the courſe
                    of his ſucceſſes againſt the enemy, that he was cut off by a mutiny among his
                    ſoldiers. The legions encamped about Moguntia, having been abominably corrupted
                    during the reign of Heliogabalus, and trained up in all kinds of rapine and
                    diſobedience, required the moſt ſtrict command. Alexander could neither endure
                    their tumultuary obedience, nor they his regular diſcipline. His own faults, and
                    thoſe of his mother Mammæa, were objected againſt him. They openly exclaimed,
                    That they were governed by an avaricious woman, and a mean-ſpirited boy ; and
                    reſolved upon electing an emperor capable of ruling alone. In this general
                    revolt, Maximinus, an old and experienced commander, held frequent conferences
                    with the ſoldiers, and enſlamed the ſedition. At length, being determined to
                    diſpatch their preſent emperor, they ſent an executioner into his tent ; who
                    immediately ſtruck off his head, and, ſhortly after, that of his mother. He died
                    in the 29th year of his age, after a proſperous reign of thirteen years and nine
                    days.</p>
                <p>The tumults occaſioned by the death of Alexander being appeaſed, Maximinus, who
                    had been the chief promoter of the ſedition, was choſen emperor. This
                    extraordinar y man, whoſe character deſerves particular attention, was born of
                    very obſcure parentage, being the ſon of a poor herdſman of Thrace. In the
                    beginning he followed his father’s profeſſion, and only exerciſed his perſonal
                    courage againſt the robbers who inſeſted the part of the country in which he
                    lived. Soon after, his ambition increaſing, he leſt his poor employment, and
                    enliſted in the Roman army ; where he ſoon became remarkable for his great
                    ſtrength, diſcipline, and courage. This gigantic man was no leſs than eight feet
                    and a half high ; he had a body and ſtrength correſponding to his ſize, being
                    not leſs remarkable for the magnitude than the ſymmetry of his perſon. His
                    wife’s bracelet uſually ſerved him for a thumb-ring ; and his ſtrength was ſo
                    great, that he was able'to draw a carriage which two oxen could not move. He
                    could ſtrike out an horſe’s teeth with a blow of his fiſt, and break its thigh
                    with a kick. His diet was as extraordinary as the reſt of his endowments ; he
                    generally eat 40 pounds weight of fleſh every day, and drank ſix gallons of
                    wine, without committing any debauch in either. With a frame ſo athletic, he was
                    poſſeſſed of a mind undaunted in danger, and neither fearing nor regarding any
                    man. The firſt time he was made known to the emperor Severus, was upon his
                    celebrating games on the birth-day of his ſon Geta. Maximinus was then a rude
                    countryman, and requeſted the emperor to be permitted to contend for the prizes
                    which were diſtributed to the beſt runners, wreſtlers, and boxers, of the army.
                    Severus, unwilling to infringe the military diſcipline,</p>

                <p>would not permit him at firſt to combat, except with ſlaves, againſt whom his
                    ſtrength appeared aſtoniſhing. He overcame 16 in running, one after the other :
                    he then kept up with the emperor on horſeback ; and having fatigued him in the
                    courſe, he was oppoſed to ſeven of the moſt active ſoldiers, and overcame them
                    with the greateſt eaſe. From that time he was particularly noticed, and taken
                    into the emperor’s body-guards, in which his aſſiduity and prompt obedience were
                    particularly remarkable. In the reign of Caracalla, he was made a centurion, and
                    diſtinguiſhed himſelf in this ſtation by his ſtrict attention to the morals and
                    diſcipline of thoſe he commanded. When made a tribune, he ſtill retained the
                    hard ſimplicity of his life ; eat as the meaneſt centinel ; ſpent whole days in
                    exerciſing his troops ; and would now and then himſelf wreſtle with eight or ten
                    of the ſtrongeſt men in the army, whom he threw with ſcarce any effort. Being
                    thus become one of the moſt remarkable men in the empire, both for courage,
                    diſcipline, and perſonal activity, he gave, ſhoit-ly after, a very high inſtance
                    of his unſhaken fidelity : for when Macrinus was made emperor, he refuſed to
                    ſerve under a prince that had betrayed his ſovereign ; and retired to Thrace,
                    his native country, where he followed commerce, and purchaſed ſome lands,
                    content with privacy rather; than a guilty dependence. Upon the acceſſion of
                    Heliogabalus to the throne, this bold veteran once more returned to the army ;
                    but was, in the very beginning, diſguſted at the baſe effeminacy of the emperor;
                    who, hearing amazing inſtances of his ſtrength, aſhed him, if he were equally
                    capable in combats of another nature ? This lewd demand was ſo little ſuitable
                    to the temper of Maximimrs, that he inſtantly left the court. Upon the death of
                    Heliogabalus, he again returned to Rome, and was received with great kindneſs by
                    Alexander, who particularly recommended him to the ſenate, and made him
                    commander of the fourth legion, which conſiſted of new-raiſed ſoldiers.
                    Maximinus gladly accepted of this charge, and performed his duty with great
                    exactneſs and ſucceſs, ſetting an example of virtue and diſcipline to all the
                    commanders of the army. Nor was his valour leſs apparent againſt the Germans,
                    whither he was ſent with his legion ; ſo that he was unanimouſly conſidered as
                    the boldeſt, braveſt, moſt valiant, and moſt virtuous ſoldier in the whole
                    empire. He ſoon, however, forfeited all theſe juſtly merited titles, when he was
                    raiſed to the throne ; and, from being the moſt loved commander in the army, he
                    became the moſt cruel tyrant upon earth. Yet in fact, his former virtues were
                    all of the ſevere and rigid kind, which, without any education, might very
                    eaſily degenerate into tyranny ; ſo that he might have miſtaken his ſucceeding
                    cruelty for diſcipline, and his ſeverity for juſtice. However this he, Maximinus
                    is conſidered as one of the greateſt monſters of cruelty that ever diſgraced
                    power ; and, fearful of nothing himſelf, he ſeemed to ſport with the terrors of
                    all mankind.</p>
                <p>He began his reign, by endeavouring to force obedience from every rank of
                    people, and by vindicating his authority by violence. The ſenate and people of
                    Rome were the firſt that incurred his reſentment. They utterly refuſing to
                    confirm the election of the army, he was the firſt emperor who reigned without
                    their concurrence or approbation. However, he ſeem</p>
                <p>ed regardleſs of their oppoſition, proceeding to ſecure his election by putting
                    all ſuch to death as had been raiſed by his predeceſſor. The Chriſtians alſo,
                    having found favour in the former reign, felt the weight of his reſentment ; and
                    were perſecuted in ſeveral parts of the empire, particularly in thoſe where he
                    himſelf reſided. His cruelty likewiſe extended to the rich, whoſe lives and
                    eſtates became a frequent ſacriſice to avarice and ſuſpicion. But what appears
                    ſtill a more extraordinary inſtance of his cruelty, being aſhamed of the
                    meanneſs of his extraction, he commanded all ſuch as were beſt acquainted with
                    him and his parentage to be ſlain, although there were ſome among the number
                    that had relieved him in his low condition.</p>
                <p>However, his cruelties did not retard his military operations, which were
                    carried on with a ſpirit becoming a better monarch. He overthrew the Germans in
                    ſeveral battles, waſted all their country with fire and ſword for 400 miſeo
                    together, and ſet a reſolution of ſubduing all the northern nations as far as
                    the ocean. In theſe expeditions, in order to attach the ſoldiers more firmly to
                    him, he increaſed their pay ; and in every duty of the camp, he himſelſ took as
                    much pains as the meaneſt centinel in his army, ſhowing incredible courage and
                    aſſiduity. In every engagement, where the conflict was hotteſt, Maximinus was
                    always ſeen fighting there in perſon, and deſtroying all before him : ſor, being
                    bred a barbarian, he conſidered it as his duty to combat as a common ſoldier,
                    while he commanded as a general.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, his cruelties had ſo alienated the minds of his ſubjects, that
                    ſeveral conſpiracies were ſecretly aimed againſt him. Magnus, a conſular perſon,
                    and ſome others, had plotted to break down a wooden bridge, as ſoon as the
                    emperor had paſſed it, and thus to abandon him to the enemy. But this being
                    diſcovered, gave Maximinus an opportunity of indulging his natural ſeverity,
                    upon this pretext alone cauſing above 4000 to be ſlain. Shortly after, ſome of
                    Alexander’s old ſoldiers withdrawing themſelves from the camp, proclaimed one
                    Quarcianus as emperor, who had been lately diſguſted at Maximinus for being
                    diſmiſſed from employment. The ſoldiers, in fact, conſtrained him to accept of
                    the dangerous ſuperiority to which he was expoſed : and ſhortly after, in the
                    ſpirit of the times, the perſon who had been the promoter of his advancement,
                    murdered him in his bed, and carried his head to Maximinus ; who received him
                    kindly at firſt, but ſoon put him to a cruel death, for his complicated guilt of
                    treaſon and treachery.</p>
                <p>Theſe partial inſurrections were ſoon after followed by a ſpirit of general
                    diſcontent throughout all the empire. The provinces of Africa were the firſt
                    that ſhowed their deteſtation of the tyrant, whoſe extortions and cruelties
                    among them were become inſupportable. They firſt flew his procurator ; and
                    afterwards conſidering how dangerous a crime they had committed, they reſolved
                    to throw off all expectations of pardon, and create a new emperor. Gordien was
                    then , proconſul of Africa, a perſon of great ſame for his virtues, and highly
                    reverenced for a blameleſs life of near 80. Him, therefore, they determined to
                    elect ; and accordingly the ſoldiers and natives aſſembling together,
                    tumultuouſly entered his houſe, reſolved to put. their deſign in execution.

                <p>they were come to kill him, being made ſenſible of their intentions, utterly
                    refuſed their offer, alleging his extreme age, and Maximinus’s power. But all
                    his oppoſition was vain : they conſtrained him to accept of the proffered
                    dignity ; and he, with his fon Gordian, who was 46 years of age, were declared
                    emperors. Being thus raiſed contrary to his inclination, the old man immediately
                    wrote to the ſenate, declaring that he had unwillingly accepted of the empire,
                    and would only keep his authority till he had freed it from the tyranny of its
                    preſent oppreffor. The ſenate very joyfully confirmed his electron, adjudging
                    Maximinus as an enemy and traitor to the ſtate. The citizens alſo ſhowed an
                    equal zeal in the cauſe : they flew upon ſuch as were the reputed friends of
                    Maximinus, and tore them in pieces ; even ſome who were innocent ſalling a
                    ſacriſice to the multitude’s blind rage. So great an alteration being made in
                    the city againſt the intereſts of Maximinus, the ſenate were reſolved to drive
                    the oppoſition to the extreme ; and accordingly made all neceſſary preparations
                    for their ſecurity, ordering Maximinus’s governors to be diſplaced, and
                    commanding all the provinces to acknowledge Gordian ſor emperor. This order was
                    differently received in different parts, as people were affected to one or the
                    other party : in ſome provinces the governors were ſlain ; in others, the
                    rael-ſengers of the ſenate ; ſo that all parts of the empire felt the
                    conſequences of the civil war.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, when Maximinus was informed of theſe charges againſt him, his
                    rage appeared ungovernable. He roared like a ſavage beaſt, and violently ſtruck
                    his head againſt the wall, ſhowing every inſtance of ungovernable diffraction.
                    At length his ſury being ſomewhat ſubiided, he called his whole army together ;
                    and, in a ſet ſpeech, exhorted them to revenge his cauſe, giving them the
                    ſtrongeſt aſſurances that they ſhould poſſeſs the eſtates of all ſuch as had
                    offended. The ſoldiers uuanimouſly promiſed to be faithful ; they received his
                    harangue with their uſual acclamations ; and, thus encouraged, he led them
                    towards Rome, breathing nothing but ſlaughter and revenge. However, he found
                    many obſtacles to his impetuoſity ; and, though he deſired nothing ſo much as
                    diſpatch, his marches were incommodious and flow. The tumultuous and diſobedient
                    armies of the empire were at preſent very different from the legions that were
                    led on by Sylla or Cæſar ; they were loaded with baggage, and followed by ſlaves
                    and women, rather reſembling an eaſtern caravan, than a military battalion. To
                    theſe inconveniences alſo was added the hatred of the cities through which he
                    paſſed, the inhabitants all abandoning their houſes upon his approach, and
                    ſecuring their proviſions in proper hiding-places. However, in this complication
                    of inconveniences and misfortunes, his affairs began to wear a favourable
                    appearance in Africa : for Capelianus, the governor of Numidia, raiſed a body of
                    troops in his favour, and marched againſt Gordian, towards Carthage ; where he
                    fought the younger Gordian, flew him, and deſtroyed his army. The father,
                    hearing of the death of his ſon, together with the loſs of the battle, ſtrangled
                    himſelf in his own girdle. Capelia-nus purſuing his victory, entered Carthage ;
                    where he gave a looſe to pillage and ſlaughter, under a pretence of revenging
                    the cauſe of Maximinus. The news of theſe ſucceſſes was ſoon brought to the
                    emperor, who now increaſed his diligence, and flattered himſelf with a ſpeedy
                    opportunity of revenge. He led on his large army by haſty journeys into Italy,
                    threatening deſtruction to all his oppoſers, and ardently wiſhing for freſh
                    opportunities of ſlaughter.</p>
                <p>Nothing could exceed the conſternation of the ſenate upon the news of this
                    defeat. They now ſaw themſelves not only deprived of the aſſiſtance of Gordian
                    and his ſon, on whom they greatly relied ; but alſo oppoſed by two formidable
                    tyrants, each commanding a victorious army, directly marching towards Rome, aud
                    meditating nothing but vengeance. In this afflicting exigence, they, with great
                    ſolemnity, met at the temple of Jupiter, and after the moſt mature
                    deliberations, choſe Pupienus and Balbinus emperors conjointly, Theſe were men
                    who had acquired the eſteem of the public both in war and peace, having
                    commanded armies, and governed provinces, with great- reputation ; and being now
                    appointed to oppoſe Maximinus, they made what levies they could, both in Rome
                    and the country. With theſe, Pupienus marched to ſtop the progreſs of the
                    invaders, leaving the city to a freſh and unlooked for calamity. This was
                    occaſioned by two of Maximinus’s ſoldiers, who, entering the ſenate-houſe, were
                    ſlain by two ſenators. This quickly gave offence to the body of the piætorian
                    ſoldiers, who inſtantly reſolved to take revenge, but were oppoſed by the
                    citizens ; ſo that nothing was ſeen throughout Rome, but tumult, ſlaughter, and
                    cruelty. In this univerſal confuſion, the calamity was increaſed by the ſoldiers
                    ſetting the city on fire, while the wretched inhabitants were combating each
                    other in the midſt of the flames.</p>
                <p>Nevertheleſs, Maximinus himſelf, in whoſe favour theſe ſeditions were promoted,
                    did not ſeem to be more fortunate. Upon being informed of the new election of
                    emperors, his fury was again renewed, and he paſſed the Alps, expecting, upon
                    entering Italy, to refreſh his fatigued and famiſhed army in that fertile part
                    of the country. But in this he was entirely diſappointed ; the ſenate had taken
                    ſuch care to remove all kinds of ſuſtenance to fortified places, that he ſtill
                    found himſelf reduced to his former neceſſities, while his army began to murmur
                    for want. To this another diſappointment was added ſhortly after : for
                    approaching the city of Aquileia, which he expected to enter without any
                    difficulty, he was aſtoniſhed to find ſt prepared for the moſt obſtinate
                    reſiſtance, and reſolved to hold out a regular ſiege. This city was well
                    fortified and populous, and the inhabitants greatly averſe to Maximinus’s
                    government ; but what added ſtill more to its ſtrength, it was commanded by two
                    excellent generals, Criſpinus and Menophilis, who had ſo well furniſhed it with
                    men and ammunition, that Maximinus found no ſmall reſiſtance, even in inveſting
                    the place. His firſt attempt was, to take the city by ſtorm ; but the beſieged
                    threw down ſuch quantities of ſcalding pitch and ſulphur upon his ſoldiers, that
                    they were unable to continue the aſſault. He then determined upon a blockade ;
                    but the inhabitants were ſo reſolute, that even the old men and children were
                    ſeen combating upon the walls, while the women cuf off their hair to furniſh the
                    ſoldiers with bow-ſtrings. Maχiminus <hi rend="sup">,</hi> 3 rage at this
                    unexpected oppoſition was&gt;</p>

                <p>now ungovernable : having no enemy to wreck his reſentment upon, he turned it
                    againſt his own commanders. He put many of his generals to death, as if the city
                    had held out through their neglect or incapacity, while famine made great
                    depredations upon the reſt of his army. Nothing now appeared on either ſide to
                    terminate the conteſt, except the total deſtruction of either. But a mutiny in
                    Maximinus’s own army a while reſcued the declining empire from deſtruction, and
                    ſaved the lives of thouſands. The ſoldiers being long haraſſed by famine and
                    fatigue, and hearing of revolts on every ſide, reſolved to terminate their
                    calamities by the tyrant’s death. His great ſtrength, and his being always
                    armed, w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> ere, at firſt, the principal motives to deter
                    any from aſſaſſinating him ; but at length having made his guards accomplices in
                    their deſign, they ſet upon him, while he ſlept at noon in his tent, and (lew
                    both him and his ſon, whom he had made his partner in the empire, without any
                    oppoſition, after an uſurpation of about three years, and in the 65th year of
                    his age.</p>
                <p>The tyrant being dead, and his body thrown to the dogs and birds of prey,
                    Pupienus and Balbinus continued for ſome time emperors without oppoſition. But
                    the prætorian ſoldiers, who had long been notorious for mutiny and treaſon, ſoon
                    reſolved on further change. Nor did the diſſenſions between the new made
                    emperors themſelves a little contribute to their downfall : for though both were
                    remarkable for wiſdom and age, yet they could not reſtrain the mutual jealouſy
                    of each other’s power. Pupienus claimed the ſuperiority from his great
                    experience ; while Balbinus was equally aſpiring upon account of his family and
                    fortune.</p>
                <p>In this ill-judged conteſt, the prætorian ſoldiers, who were enemies to both,
                    ſet upon them in their palace, at a time their guards were amuſed with ſeeing
                    the Capitoline games. Pupienus perceiving their tumultuous approach, ſent with
                    the utmoſt ſpeed for aſſiſtance from his colleague ; but he, out of a culpable
                    ſuſpicion that ſomething was deſigned only againſt himſelf, refuſed to ſend ſuch
                    of the German guards as were next his perſon. Thus the ſeditious ſoldiers found
                    an eaſy acceſs to both the emperors apartments ; and dragging them from the
                    palace towards the camp, flew them both, leaving their dead bodies in the
                    ſtreets, as a dreadful inſtance of their ſedition.</p>
                <p>In the midſt of this ſedition, as the mutineers were proceeding along, they by
                    accident met Gordian, the grandſon of him who was ſlain in Africa, and declared
                    him emperor on the ſpot. The ſenate and people had been loug reduced to the
                    neceſſity of ſuffering their emperors to be nominated by the army ; ſo that all
                    they could do in the preſent inſtance was to confirm their choice. This prince
                    was but 16 years old when he began his reign, but his virtues ſeemed to
                    compenſate for his want of experience. His principal aims were, to unite the
                    oppoſing members of the government, and to reconcile the ſoldiers and citizens
                    to each other. His learning is ſaid to have been equal to Lis virtues ; and we
                    are aſſured that he had 62,000 books in his library. His reſpect for Mifithæus,
                    his governor and inſtructor, was ſuch, that he married his daughter, and
                    profited by his co-unſels in all the critical circumſtances of his reign.</p>
                <p>The firſt four years of this emperor’s reign were attended with the utmoſt
                    proſperity ; but in the fifth he was alarmed with accounts from the eaſt, that
                    Sapor, king of Perſia, had furiouſly invaded the confines of the Roman empire,
                    and having taken Antioch, had pillaged Syria and all the adjacent provinces.
                    Beſides the Perſians, the Goths alſo invaded the empire ou their ſide, pouring
                    down like an inundation from the north, and attempting to fix their reſidence in
                    the kingdom of 1 hrace. To oppoſe both theſe invaſions, Gordian prepared an army
                    ; and having gained ſome victories over the Goths, whom he obliged to retire, he
                    turned his arms againſt the Perſians, whom he defeated upon ſeveral occaſions,
                    and forced to return home with diſgrace. In gaining theſe advantages, Mifithæus,
                    whom he had made prætorian prefect, had the principal ſhare ; but he dying ſoon
                    after (as it is ſuppoſed being poiſoned by Philip an Arabian, who was appointed
                    his ſucceſſor), the fortunes of Gordian ſeemed to die with him. The army began
                    to be no longer ſupplied with proviſions as uſual ; murmurs were heard to
                    prevail, and theſe were artfully fomented by Philip. Things thus proceeding from
                    bad to worſe, Philip was at firſt made his equal in the command of the empire ;
                    ſhortly after, inveſted with the ſole power ; and, at length, finding himſelf
                    capable of perpetrating his long meditated cruelty, Gordian was, by his order,
                    ſlain, in the 22d year of his age, after a ſucceſsful reign of near ſix years.</p>
                <p>Philip having thus murdered his benefactor, was fo fortunate as to be
                    immediately acknowledged emperor by the army. The ſenate alſo, though they
                    ſeemed at firſt to oppoſe his power, confirmed his election, and gave him, as
                    uſual, the tide of <hi rend="italic">Auguſtus.</hi> Philip was about 40 years
                    old when he came to the throne ; being the ſon of an obſcure Arabian, who had
                    been captain of a band of robbers. Upon his exaltation, he aſſo-ciattd his ſon,
                    a boy of fix years of age, as his partner in the empire ; and, in order to
                    ſecure his power at home, made peace with the Perſians, and marched his army
                    towards Rome. On his way, having conceived· a deſire to viſit his native country
                    of Arabia, he built there a city called <hi rend="italic">Philippopolis ;</hi> and from thence returning to Rome, he was received as emperor, and treated with
                    all the marks of ſubmiſſion, though not of joy. To put the people in good
                    humour, he cauſed the ſecular games to be celebrated, with a magnificence
                    ſuperior to any of his predeceſſors, it being, juſt 1000 years after the
                    building of the city. Upon occaſion of theſe games, we are told that both Philip
                    and his ſorr were converted to Chriſtianity. However this be, a murderer and an
                    ungrateful uſurper does no great honour to whatever opinion he may happen to
                    embrace. We have little account of the latter part of his reign in the wretched
                    and mutilated hiſtories of the times ; we only learn, that the Goths having
                    invaded the empire, Marinus, Philip’s lieutenant, who was ſent againſt them,
                    revolted, and cauſed himſelf to be declared emperor. This revolt, however, was
                    but of ſhort duration ; for the army which had raiſed him repented of their
                    raſhneſs, depoſed him with equal levity, and put him to death. Decius was the
                    perſon whom Philip, appointed to command in the room of the revolting general»
                    The chief merit of Decius with the emperor</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0446" facs="gri_33125011196389_0452.tif"/>
                <p>was, that when Marinus had rebelled, he averred in the ſenate, That the
                    traitor’s preſumption would be very ſhortly his ruin ; which, when it happened
                    accordingly, Philip appointed him to ſucceed in the command of the rebellious
                    army. Decius, who was a man of great ſubtlety, being thus entruſted with ſo much
                    power, upon arriving at the army found that the ſoldiers were reſolved on
                    inveſting him with the ſupreme authority. He therefore ſeemed to ſuffer -their
                    importunities, as if through conſtraint ; and, in the mean time, ſent Philip
                    word, that he had unwillingly aſſumed the title of emperor, the better to ſecure
                    it for the rightful poſſeſſor ; adding, that he only looked for a convenient
                    opportunity of giving up his pretenſions and title together. Philip knew mankind
                    too well, to rely upon ſuch profeſſions: he therefore got together what forces
                    he could ſrom the ſeveral provinces, and led them forward towards the confines
                    of Italy. However, the army was ſcarce arrived at Verona, when it revolted in
                    favour of Decius, and ſetting violently upon Philip, a centinel, with one blow,
                    cut off his head, or rather cleaved it afunder, ſeparating the under jaw from
                    the upper. Such was the deſerved death of Philip, in the 45th year of his age,
                    after a reign of about five years ; Decius being univerſally acknowledged as his
                    ſucceſſor, A. D. 248.</p>
                <p>The activity and wiſdom of Decius in ſome meaſure flopped the haſtening decline
                    of the Roman empire. The ſenate ſeemed to think ſo highly of his merits, that
                    they voted him not inferior to Trajan ; and indeed he ſeemed in evety inſtance
                    to conſult their dignity in particular, and the welfare of all inferior ranks of
                    people. He permitted them to chooſe a cenſor, as was the cuſtom in the
                    flouriſhing times of Rome ; and Valerian, his general, a man of ſuch ſtrict
                    morals, that bis liſe was ſaid to be a continual cenſorſhip, was choſen to that
                    dignity.—But no virtues could now prevent the approaching downfall of the ſtate
                    : the obſtinate diſputes between the Pagans and the Chriſtians within the
                    empire, and the unceaſing irruptions of barbarous nations from without,
                    enfeebled it beyond the power of a remedy. To ſtop theſe, a perſecution of the
                    Chri-ftians, who were now grown the moſt numerous body of the people, was
                    impolitically, not to ſay unjuſtly, begun ; in which thouſands were put to
                    death, and all the arts of cruelty tried in vain to leſſen their growing number.
                    This perſecution was ſucceeded by dreadful devaſtations from the Goths,
                    particularly in Thrace and Mæfia, where they had been moſt ſucceſsful. Theſe
                    irruptions Decius went to oppoſe in perſon ; and coming to an engagement with
                    them, flew 30,000 of the barbarians in one battle. However, being reſolved to
                    purſue his victory, he was, by the treachery of Gallus his own general, led into
                    a defile, where the king of the Goths had ſecret information to attack him. In
                    this diſadvantageous ſituation, Decius firſt ſaw his ſon killed with an arrow,
                    and ſoon after his whole army put to the rout. Wherefore, reſolving not to
                    ſurvive his loſs, he put ſpurs to his horſe, and inſtantly plunging into a
                    quagmire, was ſwallowed up, and his body could never be found after. He died in
                    the 5 <hi rend="sup">,</hi> oth year of his age, after a ſhort reign of two
                    years and ſix months ; leaving the character of an excellent prince, and one
                    capable of averting the de</p>
                <p>ſtruction of the empire, if human means could have effected it.</p>
                <p>Gallus, who had thus betrayed the Roman army, had'addreſs enough to get himſelf
                    declared emperor by that part of it which ſurvived the defeat ; he was 45 years
                    old when he began to reign, and was deſeended from an honourable family in Rome.
                    He bought a diſhonourable peace from the enemies of the ſtate, agreeing to pay a
                    conſiderable annual tribute to the Goths, whom it was his duty to repreſs.
                    Having thus purchaſed a ſhort remiſſion from war, by the diſgrace of his
                    country, he returned to Rome, to give a looſe to his pleaſures, regardleſs of
                    the wretched ſituation of the empire.</p>
                <p>Nothing can be more deplorable than the ſtate of the Roman provinces at this
                    time. The Goths and other barbarous nations, not ſatisfied with their late
                    bribes to continue in peace, broke in upon the eaſtern parts of Europe. On the
                    other ſide, the Perſians and Scythians committed unheard of ravages in
                    Meſope-tamia and Syria. The emperor, regardleſs of every national calamity, was
                    loſt in debauch and ſenſuality at home ; and the Pagans were allowed a power of
                    perſecuting the Chriſtians through all parts of the ſtate ; theſe calamities
                    were ſucceeded by a peſtilence, that ſeemed to have in general ſpread over every
                    part of the earth, and which continued raging for ſeveral years in an unheard of
                    manner ; and all theſe by a civil war, which followed ſhortly after, between
                    Gallus and his general Æmilianus, who having gained a victory over the Goths,
                    was proclaimed emperor by his conquering army. Gallus hearing this, was ſoon
                    rouſed from the intoxications of pleaſure, and prepared to oppoſe his dangerous
                    rival. Both armies met in Mœ-ſia, and a battle, enſued, in which Æmilianus was
                    victorious, and Gallus, with his ſon, were ſlain. His death was merited, and his
                    vices were ſuch as to deſerve the deteſtation of poſterity. He died in the 47th
                    year of his age, alter an unhappy reign of two years and four months, in which
                    the empire ſuffered inex-preſſible calamities. Æmilianus, after his victory over
                    Gallus, expected to be acknowledged emperor ; but he ſoon found himſelf
                    miſerably diſappointed., the ſenate refuſed to acknowledge his claims ; and an
                    army that was ſtationed near the Alps choſe Valerian, their own commander, to
                    ſucceed to the throne. In conſequence of this, Æmilianus’s ſoldiers began to
                    confi-der their general as an obſtacle to the univerſal tranquillity, and flew
                    him in order to avoid the miſchiefs of a civil war.</p>
                <p>Valerian being thus univerſally acknowledged as emperor, although arrived at the
                    age of 70, ſet about reforming the ſtate with a ſpirit that ſeemed to mark a
                    good mind and unabated vigour. But reformation was then grown almoſt
                    impracticable. The diſputes between the Pagans and Chriſtians divided the empire
                    as before ; and a dreadful persecution of the latter enſued. The northern
                    nations over-ran the Roman dominions in a more formidable manner than ever ; and
                    the empire began to be uſurped by a multitude of petty leaders, each of whom,
                    neglecting the general ſtate, ſet up ſor himſelf. To add to theſe calamities,
                    the Perſians, under their king Sapor, invaded Syria ; and coming into
                    Meſopotamia, took the unfortunate Valerian pr,i-</p>

                <p>ſoner, as he was making preparations to oppoſe them. Nothing can exceed the
                    indignities, as well as the cruelties, which were practiſed upon this unhappy
                    monarch, thus fallen into the hands of his enemies. Sapor, we are told, always
                    uſed him as a footſtool ſor mounting his horſe ; he added the bitterneſs of
                    ridicule to his inſults, and uſually obſerved, That an attitude like that to
                    which Valerian was reduced, was the beſt ſtatue that could be erected in honour
                    of his victory. This horrid liſe of inſult and ſufferance continued for ſeven
                    years, and was at length terminated by the cruel Perſian’s commanding his
                    priſoner’s eyes to be plucked out, and afterwards cauſing him to be ſtead alive.</p>
                <p>The news of the defeat of the Roman army by the Perſians, and the captivity of
                    Valerian, no ſooner reached the barbarous nations at war with Rome, than they
                    poured on all ſides into the Roman territories in incredible multitudes,
                    threatening the empire, and Rome itſelf, with utter deſtruction. The Goths and
                    Scythians ravaged Pontus and Aſia, committing every where dreadful devaſtations
                    ; the Alemanni and Franks having over-run Rhætia, advanced as far as Ravenna;
                    putting all to fire and ſword ; the Quadi and Sarmatians ſeized on great part of
                    Dacia and Pannonia ; while other barbarous nations, invading Spain, made
                    themſelves maſters of Tarraco and other important places in that province. In
                    the mean time Gallienus, the ſon of Valerian, having promiſed to revenge his
                    father’s captivity, and repreſs the barbarians, was choſen emperor without any
                    oppoſition. He was at that time in Gaul ; but haſtened into Italy, from whence
                    he drove out the barbarians, either by the terror of his approach, or by
                    overcoming them in battle.— In Dacia and Pannonia, alſo, the barbarians were
                    driven back by Regillianus, who commanded there, and who is ſaid to have gained
                    ſeveral victories in one day.</p>
                <p>But in the mean time, one Ingenuus, a man of great reputation in war, and
                    univerſally beloved both by the people and ſoldiery, cauſed himſelf to be
                    proclaimed emperor in Pannonia, where he was generally acknowledged as well as
                    in Mæſia. Gallienus no ſooner heard of his revolt, than he marched from the
                    neighbourhood of Ravenna, where he then was, into Illyricum, engaged Ingenuus,
                    and put him to flight. Some authors tell us, that Ingenuus was killed after the
                    battle by his own ſoldiers ; while others affirm, that he put an end to his own
                    life to avoid falling into the hands of Gallienus, who uſed his victory with a
                    cruelty hardly to be parallelled. The following letter to Verianus Celer, one of
                    his officers, will ſhow the diſpoſition of this emperor ; “ I ſhall not be
                    ſatisfied (ſays he) with your putting to death only ſuch as have borne arms
                    againſt me, and might have fallen in the field : you muſt in every city deſtroy
                    all the males, old and young ; ſpare none who have wiſhed ill to me ; none who
                    have ſpoken ill of me the ſon of Valerian, the father and brother of princes.
                    Ingenuus emperor 1. Tear, kill, cut in pieces without mercy : you underſtand me
                    ; do then as you know I would do, who have written to you with my own hand.” In
                    conſequence of theſe cruel orders, a moſt dreadful havock was made among that
                    unhappy people ; .and, in ſeveral cities, not one male child was left alive. The
                    troops who had formerly ſerved under Ingenuus, and the inhabitants of Mæſia who
                    had eſcaped the general</p>
                <p>ſlaughter, provoked by theſe cruelties, proclaimed Re* gillianus emperor. He was
                    a Dacian by birth, deſeended, as was ſaid, ſrom the celebrated king Decebalus
                    whom Trajan had conquered ; and had, by ſeveral gallant actions, gained
                    reputation in the Roman armies. After he was proclaimed emperor, he gained great
                    advantages over the Sarmatians ; but was ſoon after, murdered by his own
                    ſoldiers. Theſe revolts were quickly followed by many others. Indeed it is not
                    ſurpriſing, at a time when the reins of government were held with ſo looſe an
                    hand, that a crowd of uſurpers ſhould ſtart up in every province of the empire.
                    The great number of uſurpers who pretended to the empire about this time have
                    been diſtinguiſhed by the name of the <hi rend="italic">thirty tyrants.</hi> However, there were only 19 ; viz. Cyriades, Macrianus, Baliſta, Udenatus, and
                    Zenobia in the eaſt : in Gaul, and the weſtern provinces, Poſt-humus, Lollianns,
                    Victorinus and his mother Victoria, Marius, and Tetricus ; in Illyricum, and on
                    the confines of the Danube, Ingenuus, Regillianus, and Au-reolus ; in Pontus,
                    Saturninus ; in Iſſuria, Trebellianus ; in Theſſaly, Piſo ; in Achaia, Valens ;
                    in. Egypt, -Æmilianus ; and in Africa, Celſus. Several of theſe pretenders to
                    the empire, however, though branded with the opprobrious appellation of tyrants,
                    were eminent examples of virtue, and almoſt all of them were poſſeſſed of a
                    conſiderable ſhare of vigour and ability. The principal reaſon aſſigned for
                    their revolt was, the infamous character of Gallienus, whom neither officers nor
                    ſoldiers could bear to ſerve. Many of them, how« ever, were forced by the
                    ſoldiers to affirme the imperial dignity much againſt their will. “ You have
                    loſt,” ſaid Saturninus to his ſoldiers when they inveſted him with the purple, “
                    a very uſeſui commander, and have made a very wretched emperor.” The
                    apprehenſions of Saturninus were juſtified by the event. Of the 19 uſurpers
                    already mentioned, not one died a natural death ; and in Italy and Rome
                    Gallienus alone continued to be acknowledged emperor. That prince indeed
                    honoured Odenatus prince of Palmyra with the title of <hi rend="italic">Augujlus <hi rend="sub">y</hi></hi> who continued to poſſeſs an independent ſovereignty in the eaſt all his
                    liſetime, and on his death tranſmitted it to his wife Zenobia. See Palmyra/</p>
                <p>The conſequences of theſe numerous uſurpations were the moſt fatal that can be
                    conceived. The elections of theſe precarious emperors, their life and death,
                    were equally deſtructive to their ſubjects and adherents. The price of their
                    elevation was inſtantly paid to the troops by an immenſe donative drawn from the
                    exhauſted people. However virtuous their character, and however pure their
                    intentions might be, they found themſelves reduced to the neceſſity of
                    ſupporting their uſurpation by frequent acts of rapine and cruelty. When they
                    fell, they involved armies and provinces in their fall, as appears from the
                    letter of Gallienus ah ready quoted. Whilſt-the forces of the ſtate were
                    diſperſed in private quarrels, the defenceleſs provinces lay expoſed· to every
                    invader. The braveſt uſurpers were compelled, by the perplexity of their
                    ſituation, to conclude diſhonourable treaties with the barbarians, and even to
                    ſubmit to ſhameful tributes, and - introduce ſuch numbers of barbarians into the
                    Roman ſervice as ſeemed ſufficient at once to overthrow the empire.</p>

                <p>But when the empire ſeemed thus ready to ſink at once, it ſuddenly revived on
                    the death of Gallienus, who was murdered by Martian, one of his own generals,
                    while he beſieged Aureolus, one of the tyrants, in Milan. His death gave general
                    ſatisſaction to all, except his ſoldiers, who hoped to reap the reward of their
                    treachery by the plunder of Milan. But being fruſtrated in theſe expectations,
                    and in ſome meaſure kept within bounds by the largeſſes of Martian, Flavius
                    Claudius was nominated to ſucceed, and joyfully accepted by all orders of the
                    ſtate, and his title confirmed by the ſenate and the people.</p>
                <p>We are not ſufficiently aſſured of this emperor’s lineage and country. Some
                    affirm that he was born in Dalmatia, and deſeended from an ancient family there
                    ; others aſſert that he was a Trojan ; and others, that he was ſon to the
                    emperor Gordian. But, whatever might have been his deſcent, his merits were by
                    no means doubtful. He was a man of great valour and conduct, having performed
                    the moſt eminent ſervices againſt the Goths, who had long continued to make
                    irruptions into the empire. He was now about 55 years old, equally remarkable
                    ſor the ſtrength of his body and the vigour of his mind ; he was chaſte and
                    temperate, a rewarder of the good, and a ſevere puniſher of ſuch as tranſgreſſed
                    the laws. Thus endowed, therefore, he in ſome meaſure put a ſtop to the
                    precipitate decline of the empire, and once more ſeemed to reſtore the glory of
                    Rome.</p>
                <p>His firſt ſucceſs, upon being made emperor, was againſt Aureolus, whom he
                    defeated near Milan. His next expedition was to oppoſe the Goths, againſt whom
                    he led a very numerous army. Theſe barbarians had made their principal and moſt
                    ſucceſsful irruptions into Thrace and Macedonia, ſwarmed over all Greece, and
                    had pillaged the famous city of Athens, which had long been the ſchool of all
                    the polite arts to the Romans. The Goths, however, had no veneration for thoſe
                    em-belliſhments that tend to ſoften and humanize the mind, but deſtroyed all
                    monuments of taſte and learning with the moſt ſavage alacrity. It was upon one
                    of theſe occaſions, that, having heaped together a large pile of books in order
                    to burn them, one of the commanders diſſuaded them from the deſign, alleging,
                    that the time which the Grecians ſhould waſte on books would only render them
                    more unqualified ſor war. But the empire ſeemed to tremble, not only on that
                    ſide, but almoſt on every quarter. At the ſame time, above 300,000 of theſe
                    barbarians (the Heruli, the Trutangi, the Virtur-gi, and many nameleſs and
                    uncivilized nations) came down the river Danube, with 2000 ſhips, fraught with
                    men and ammunition, ſpreading terror and devaſtation on every ſide.</p>
                <p>In this ſtate of univerſal diſmay, Claudius alone ſeem-ed to continue unſhaken.
                    He marched hie diſpropor-tioned army againſt the ſavage invaders ; and though
                    but ill prepared for ſuch an engagement, as the forces Of the empire were then
                    employed in different parts of the world, he came off victorious, and made an
                    incredible ſlaughter of the enemy. The whole of their great army was cither cut
                    to pieces or taken priſoners : houſes were filled with their arms ; and ſcarce a
                    province of the empire, that was not furniſhed with ſlaves from thoſe that
                    ſurvived the defeat. Theſe ſucceſſes were followed by many others in different
                    parts of the empire; fothat</p>
                <p>the Goths, ſor a conſiderable time aſtcr, made but a ſeeble oppoſition. He ſome
                    time after marched againſt the revolted Germans, and overthrew them with
                    conſiderable ſlaughter. His laſt expedition was to oppoſe Tetricus and Zenobia,
                    his two pniſſant rivals in the empire. But on his march, as he approached near
                    Sirmium, in Pannonia, he was ſeized with a peſtilential fever, of which he died
                    in a ſew days, to the great regret of his ſubjects, and the irreparable loſs of
                    the Roman empire. His reign, which was not quite two years continuance, was
                    active and ſucceſsful ; and ſuch is the character given of him by hiſtorians,
                    that he is ſaid to have united in himſelf the moderation of Auguſtus, the valour
                    of Trajan, and the piety of Anto∙∙ ninus.</p>
                <p>Immediately after the death of Claudius, the army made unanimous choice of
                    Aurelian, who was at that time maſter of the horſe, and eſteemed the moſt
                    valiant commander of his time. However, his promotion was not without oppoſition
                    on the part of the ſenate, as Quintilius, the brother of the deceaſed emperor,
                    put in his claim, and was ſor a while acknowledged at Rome. But his authority
                    was of very ſhort duration ; for find· ing himſelf abandoned by thoſe who at
                    firſt inſtigated him to declare for the throne, he choſe to prevent the ſeverity
                    of his rival by a voluntary death, and cauſing his veins to be opened, expired,
                    after having reigned but 17 days.</p>
                <p>Aurelian being thus univerſally acknowledged by all the ſtates of the empire,
                    aſſumed the command, with a greater ſhow of power than his predeceſſors had
                    enjoyed for ſome time before. This active monarch was born of mean and obſcure
                    parentage in Dacia, and was about 55 years old at the time of his coming to the
                    throne. He had ſpent the earjy part of his life in the army, and had riſen
                    through all the gradations of military duty. He was of unſhaken courage and
                    amazing ſtrength ; he in one engagement killed 40 of the enemy with his own
                    hand, and above 900 at ſeveral different times. In ſhort, hie valour and
                    expedition were ſuch, that he was compared to Julius Cæſar ; and, in fact, only
                    wanted mildneſs and clemency to be every way his equal.</p>
                <p>The whole of this monarch’s reign was ſpent in repreſſing the irruptions of the
                    northern nations, in humbling every other pretender to the empire, and puniſhing
                    the monſtrous irregularities of his own ſubjects. He defeated the Marcαmanni,
                    that had invaded Italy, in three ſeveral engagements, and at length totally
                    deſtroyed their army. He was not leſs ſucceſsful againſt Zenobia, the queen of
                    the Eaſt, a woman of the moſt heroic qualifications, who had long diſclaimed the
                    Roman power, and eſtabliſhed an empire of her own, as is related under the
                    article Palmyra.</p>
                <p>Aurelian having thus brought back peace to the empire, endeavoured, by the
                    rigours of juſtice, to bring back virtue alſo. He was very ſtrict in puniſhing
                    the crimes of the ſoldiery : in his orders to his lieutenants, he inſiſted that
                    the peaſants ſhould not be plundered upon any pretences ; that not even a grape,
                    a grain of ſalt, or a drop of oil, ſhould be exacted unjuſtly. He cauſed a
                    ſoldier, who had committed adultery with his hoſteſs, to have his ſeet tied to
                    the tops of two trees, forcibly bent at top to meet each other ; which being let
                    looſe, and ſuddenly recoiling, tore the</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0449" facs="gri_33125011196389_0455.tif"/>
                <p>criminal in two. This was a ſeverity that might take the name of cruelty ; but
                    the vices of the age, in ſome meaſure, required it. In theſe puniſhments
                    inflicted on the guilty, the Chriſtians, who had all along been growing more
                    numerous, were ſharers. Againſt theſe he drew up ſeveral letters and edicts,
                    which ſhowed that he intended a very ſevere perſecution ; but if we may believe
                    the credulous hiſtorians of the times, he was diverted juſt as he was going
                    tv&gt; ſign them by a thunderbolt, which fell ſo near his perſon, that all
                    the people judged him to be deſtroyed.</p>
                <p>But, however Heaven might have interpoſed on this occaſion, ſt is certain that
                    his ſeverities at laſt were the cauſe of his deſtruction. Meneſthus, his
                    principal ſecretary, having been threatened by him for ſome fault which he had
                    committed, began to c <hi rend="sup">1</hi> θnfider how he might prevent the
                    meditated blow. For this purpoſe, he forged a roll of the names of ſeveral
                    perſons, whom he pretended the emperor had marked out for death, adding his own
                    to ſtrengthen him in the conſidence of the party. The ſcroll thus contrived was
                    ſhown with an air of the utmoſt ſecrecy to ſome of the perſons concerned ; and
                    they, to procure their ſafety, immediately agreed with him to deſtroy the
                    emperor. This reſolution was ſoon put in execution ; for, as the emperor paſſed
                    with a ſmall guard from Uraclea, in Thrace, towards Byzantium, the conſpirators
                    ſet upon him at once, and flew him with very ſmall reſiſtance. He was ſlain in
                    the 6oth, or, as ſome ſay, in the 6 id year of his age, after a very active
                    reign of almoſt five years.</p>
                <p>The number of pretenders to the throne, which had formerly inſeſted the empire,
                    were, by the laſt monarch’s activity, ſo entirely removed, that there now ſeemed
                    to be none that would venture to declare himſelf a candidate. The army referred
                    the choice to the ſenate ; and, on the other ſide, the ſenate declined it ; ſo
                    that a ſpace of near eight months elapſed in theſe negociations. At length,
                    however, the ſenate made choice of Tacitus, a man of great merit, and noway
                    ambitious of the honours that were offered him. Upon being ſolicited to accept
                    the empire, he at firſt refuſed, and retired to his country-houſe in Campania,
                    to avoid their importunities ; but being at length prevailed upon, he accepted
                    the reins of government, being at that time yy years old.</p>
                <p>One of the firſt acts of his government was the puniſhment of thoſe who had
                    conſpired againſt the late emperor. Meneſthus was impaled alive, his body being
                    thrown to be devoured by wild beaſts ; his eſtate alſo was conſiſcated to the
                    exchequer ; and his ready money, which was very conſiderable, applied towards
                    paying the army. During this ſhort reign, the ſenate ſeemed to have a large
                    ſhare of authority, and the hiſtorians of the times are liberal of their praiſes
                    to ſuch emperors as were thus willing to divide their power.— Upon endeavouring
                    to obtain the conſulſhip for his brother Probus, he was refuſed it by the ſenate
                    ; at which he ſeemed no way moved, but calmly remarked that the ſenate beſt knew
                    whom to chooſe. This moderation prevailed in all the reſt of his conduct ; hc
                    was extremely temperate ; his table was plain, and furniſhed with nothing
                    expenſive ; he even prohibited his empreſs from wearing jewels, and forbad the
                    uſe of gold and embroidery. He was Fond of learning, and the •memory of ſuch men
                    as had deſerved well of theif country. He particularly eſteemed the works of his
                    nameſake Tacitus the hiſtorian ; commanding that they ſhould be placed in every
                    public library throughout the empire, and that many copies of them ſhould be
                    tran-ſcribed at the public charge. A reign begun with ſuch moderation and
                    juſtice, only wanted continuance to have made the empire happy ; but after
                    enjoying the empire about ſix months, hc died of a fever in his march to oppoſe
                    the Perſians and Scythians, who had invaded the eaſtern parts of the empire.</p>
                <p>Upon the death of Tacitus the army ſeemed divided in the choice of an emperor ;
                    one part of it choſe Flo-rianus, brother to the deceaſed ; but the majority were
                    for ſome time undetermined. They alleged amongſt each other the neceſſity of
                    chooſing one eminent for valour, honour, piety, clemency, and probity ; but the
                    laſt virtue being that chiefly inſiſted upon, the whole army, as if by common
                    conſent, cried out that Probus ſhould be emperor. He was accordingly confirmed
                    in this dignity with the uſual ſolemnities : and Florianus finding himſelſ
                    deſerted, even by thoſe legions who had promiſed to ſtand up in his ſupport,
                    opened his arteries and bled himſelf to death.</p>
                <p>Probus was 44 years old when he aſcended the throne, being born of noble
                    parentage at Sirmium in Pannonia, and bred up a ſoldier ſrom his youth. He began
                    early to diſtinguiſh himſelf for his diſcipline and valour ; being ſrequently
                    the firſt man who in beſieging towns ſealed the walls, or that burſt into the
                    enemy’s camp. He was no leſs remarkable for ſingle combats, and ſaving the lives
                    of many eminent citizens. Nor was his activity and courage, when elected to the
                    empire, leſs apparent, than in his private ſtation. He firſt repreſſed the
                    Germans in Gaul, of whom he flew 400,000. He then marched into Dalmatia, to
                    oppoſe and ſubdue the Sarmatians. From thence he led his forces into Thrace, and
                    forced the Goths to ſuc for peace. He after that turned his arms towards Aſia ;
                    ſubdued the province of Iſauria ; and marching onward, conquered a people called
                    the <hi rend="italic">Blemyes ;</hi> who, leaving their native ſoreſts of
                    Ethiopia, had poſſeſſed themſelves of Arabia and Judea, and had continued in a
                    ſtate of rebellion ſince the reign of Gallienus. Nar-ſis alſo, the king of
                    Perſia, ſubmitted at his approach : and upon his return into Europe, he divided
                    the depopulated parts of Thrace among its barbarous invaders : a circumſtance
                    that afterwards produced great calamities to the empire.</p>
                <p>His diligence was not leſs conſpicuous in ſuppreffing inteſtine commotions.
                    Saturninus, being compelled by the Egyptians to declare himſelf emperor, was
                    defeated and ſlain. Proculus alſo (a perſon remarkable only for his great
                    attachment to women, and who boaſted in a letter, that, having taken 100
                    Sarmatian virgins priſoners, he deprived ten of that name in one night, and all
                    the reſt within a fortnight) ſet up againſt the emperor ; but was compelled to
                    fly, and at length delivered up by the Germans. At the ſame time Conoſus (who
                    was a remarkable votary to Bacchus, being able to drink as much wine as ten
                    could do, without being difordered <hi rend="sub">4</hi> ) rebelled, and being
                    overcome hanged himſelf in deſpair. Probus, when he ſaw him immediately after
                    his death, could not avoid pointing to him, and ſaying, <hi rend="sup">w</hi> There hangs not a man but a caſk.” Still, however, not-withſtauding every effort
                    to give quiet to the empire,</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0450" facs="gri_33125011196389_0456.tif"/>
                <p>the barbarians who ſurrounded it kept it in continual alarms. They were
                    frequently repulſed'into their native wilds, but they as certainly returned with
                    freſh rage and increaſed ferocity. The Goths and Vandals, finding the emperor
                    engaged in quelling domeſtic diſputes, renewed their accuſtomed inroads, and
                    once more felt the puniſhment of their preſumptions. They were conquered in
                    ſeveral engagements ; and Probus returned in triumph to Rome. His active temper,
                    however, would not ſuffer him to continue at reſt whilſt a ſingle enemy was left
                    to conquer. In his laſt expedition he led his ſoldiers againſt the Perſians ;
                    and going through Sirmium, the place of his nativity, he there employed ſeveral
                    thouſands of his ſoldiers in draining a fen that was incommodious to the
                    inhabitants. The fatigues of this undertaking, and the great reſtraint that was
                    laid upon the ſoldiers licentious manners, produced a conſpiracy, which ended in
                    his ruin : for taking the opportunity as he was marching into Greece, they ſet
                    upon and flew him after he had reigned ſix years and four months with general
                    approbation.</p>
                <p>Carus, who was prætorian prefect to the deceaſed emperor, was choſen by the army
                    to ſucceed him; and he, to ſtrengthen his authority, named his two ſons Carinus
                    and Numerianus with him in command ; the former of whom was as much ſullied by
                    his vices, as the youngeſt was virtuous, modeſt, and courageous. The new emperor
                    had ſcarce time to puniſh the murderers of the late monarch, when he was alarmed
                    by a freſh irruption of the Sarmatians ; over whom he gained a ſignal victory.
                    The Perſian monarch alſo made ſome attempts upon the empire ; but Carus aſſured
                    his ambaſſadors, that if their maſter perſiſted in his obſtinacy, all his fields
                    ſhould ſhortly be as bare as his own bald head, which he ſhowed them. In
                    conſequence of this threat, he n,arched to the very walls of Cteſiphon, and a
                    dreadful battle enſuing, he once more gained a complete victory. What the reſult
                    of this ſucceſs might have been, is not known ; for he was ſhortly after ſtruck
                    dead by lightning in his tent, with many .others that were round him.
                    Numerianus, the youngeſt ſon, who accompanied his father in this expedition, was
                    inconſolable for his death; and brought ſuch a diſorder upon his eyes with
                    weeping, that he was obliged to be carried along with the army, ſhut up in a
                    cloſe litter. The peculiarity of his ſituation, after ſome time, excited the
                    ambition of Aper, his father-in-law, who ſuppoſed that he could now, without any
                    great danger, aim at the empire himſelf. He therefore hired a mercenary villain
                    to murder the emperor in his litter ; and the better to conceal the fact, gave
                    out that he was ſtill alive, but unable to endure the light. In this manner was
                    the dead body carried about for ſome days, Aper continuing to attend it with the
                    utmoſt appearance of reſpect, and to take orders as uſual. The offenſiveneſs,
                    however, of its ſmell at length diſcovered the treachery, and excited an
                    univerſal uproar throughout the army. In the midſt of this tumult, Diocleſian,
                    one of the moſt noted commanders of his time, was choſen emperor, 3nd with his
                    own hand flew Aper ; having thus, as it is ſaid, fulfilled a prophecy, which had
                    ſaid, that Dio-eleſian ſhould be emperor after he had ſlain*a boar ; alluding to
                    the name of his rival, which ſigniſies· a boar. Garinus, the remaining ſon, did
                    not long ſurvive hie fa,ther and. brother j for giving himſelf up" to his vices,
                    and yet at the ſame time oppoſing the new-made emperor, the competitors led
                    their forces into Mæfia ; where Diocleſian being victorious, Carinus was ſlain
                    by a tribune of his own army, whoſe wife he had formerly abuſed.</p>
                <p>Diocleſian was a perſon of mean birth ; being accounted, according to ſome, the
                    ſon of a ſcrivener ; and of a ſlave, according to others. He received his name
                    from Dioclea, H.e town in which he was born ; and was about 40 years old when he
                    was elected to the empire. He pardoned all who had joined Carinus, without
                    injuring either their fortunes or honours. Conſcious alſo that the weight of
                    empire was too heavy for one alone to ſuſtain, he took in Maximian, his general,
                    as a partner in the fatigues of duty, making him his equal and companion on the
                    throne. Thus mutually aſſiſting each other, theſe two continued to live in
                    ſtrict friendſhip ; and though ſomewhat differing in temper (as Maximian was
                    rather.aman of vicious inclinations), yet they concurred in promoting the
                    general good, and humbling their enemies- And it muſt be obſerved, that there
                    never was a period in which there were more numerous or formidable enemies to
                    oppoſe.</p>
                <p>The peafants and labourers in Gaul made a dangerous inſurrection, under the
                    conduct of Amandus and Helianus, but were ſubdued by Maximian. Achilleus, who
                    commanded in Egypt, proclaimed himſelf emperor ; and it was not without many
                    bloody engagements that he was overcome, and condemned by Diocleſian to be
                    devoured by lions. In Africa, the Roτ man legions, in like manner, joined with
                    many of the natives, ſeized upon the public revenues, and plundered thoſe who
                    continued in their duty. Theſe were alſo ſubdued by Maximian ; and, after a long
                    dubious war <hi rend="sub">r</hi> conſtrained to ſue for peace. About the ſame
                    time, a. principal commander in Britain, named <hi rend="italic">Carattjius,</hi> proclaimed himſelf emperor, and poſſeſſed himſelf of the iſland. To oppoſe
                    this general’s claims, Maximianmade choice of Conſtantius Chlorus, whom he
                    created: Cæſar, and married to Theodora his daughter-in-law. He, upon his
                    arrival in Britain, finding Carauſius very ſtrong, and continually reinforced
                    from Germany,, thought proper to come to an accommodation ; io that this uſurper
                    continued for ſeven years in quiet poſſeſſion of the whole iſland, till he was
                    ſlain by Alectus, his friend and intimate. About this time alſo, Narſes, king of
                    Perſia, began a dangerous war upon the empire, and invaded Meſopotamia. To ſtop
                    the progreſs of the enemy upon this quarter, Diocleſian made choice of Ga-lerius
                    (ſurnamed <hi rend="italic">Armentarius,</hi> from the report of his being
                    born of a cow-herd in Dacia) ; and he likewiſe was created Cæſar. His ſucceſs
                    alſo, though very, doubtful in the beginning, was in the end terminated
                    according to his wiſhes. The Perſians were overcome in a deciſive engagement,
                    their camp plundered and ta, ken, and their king’s wives and children made
                    priſoners of war. There only remained, of all the enemies of the Roman empire,
                    thoſe who lay to the northward un? ſubdued. Theſe were utterly unconquerable, as
                    well upon account of their ſavage fierceneſs, as the inholpi-table ſeverity of
                    the climate and ſoil ſrom whence they iſſued. Ever at war with the Romans, they
                    iſſued forth, when the armies that were to repreſs their inva-fions were called
                    away ; and upon their return, they as ſuddenly withdrew into cαld <hi rend="sub"
                        > i</hi> barren, and inacceſſible</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0451" facs="gri_33125011196389_0457.tif"/>
                <p>places, which only themſelves could endure. In this manner the Goths,
                    Sarmatians, Alani. Quadi, &amp;c. poured down in incredible numbers ; while
                    every defeat ſeemed but to increaſe their ſtrength and perſeverance. Of theſe,
                    multitudes were taken priſoners, and ſent to people the more ſouthern parts of
                    the empire ; ſtill greater numbers were deſtroyed ; and though the reſt were
                    driven back to their native foreſts, yet they continued ever mindful of then·
                    inveterate enmity, and, like a ſavage beaſt, only continued inactive, till they
                    had licked their wounds for â new encounter.</p>
                <p>During this interval, as if the external miſeries of the empire were not
                    ſufficient, the tenth and laſt great perſecution was renewed againſt the
                    Chriſtians. This is ſaid to have exceeded all the former in ſeverity : and ſuch
                    was the zeal with which it was purſued, that, in an ancient inſcription, we are
                    unformed that they had effaced the name and ſuperſtition of the Chriſtians, and
                    had reſtored and propagated the worſhip of the gods. Their attempts, however,
                    were but the malicious efforts of an expiring party ; for Chriſtianity ſhortly
                    after was eſtabliſhed by law, and triumphed over the malice of all its enemies.
                    In the midſt of the troubles raiſed by this perſecution, and of the conteſts
                    that ſtruck at the internal parts of the ſtate, Diocleſian and Maximian
                    ſurpriſed the world by reſigning their dignities on the ſame day, and both
                    retiring into private ſtations. Hiſtorians are much divided concerning the
                    motives that thus induced them to give up thoſe honours which they had purchaſed
                    with ſo much danger. Some aſeribe it to the philoſophical turn of Diocleſian ;
                    and others, to his being diſguſted with the obſtinacy of his Chriſtian ſubjects
                    : but Lactantius aſſerts, that he was compelled to it, together with his
                    partner, by Galerius, who coming to Nicomedia, upon the emperor’s recovery ſrom
                    a great ſickneſs, threatened him with a civil war in caſe he refuſed to reſign.
                    However, of this we are well aſſured, that he ſtill preſerved a dignity of
                    ſentiment in his retirement, that might induce us to believe he had no other
                    motive for reſignation than the love of quiet, and the conſciouſneſs of his
                    inability to diſeharge on a ſick-bed the duties of a ſovereign. Having retired
                    to his birth-place, he ſpent his time in cultivating his garden, aſſuring his
                    viſitors that then only he began to enjoy the world, when he was thought by the
                    reſt of mankind to forſake it. When alſo ſome attempted to per-fuade him to
                    reſume the empire, he replied, That if they knew his preſent happineſs, they
                    would rather endeavour to imitate than diſturb it. In this contented manner he
                    lived ſome time, and at laſt died either by poiſon of madneſs, it is uncertain
                    which. His reign, which continued 20 years, was active and uſeful ; and his
                    authority, tinctured with ſeverity, was well adapted to the depraved ſtate of
                    morals at that time.</p>
                <p>Maximian, his partner in the empire and in reſignation, was by no means ſo
                    contented with his ſituation. He longed once more for power, and diſturbed the
                    two ſucceeding reigns with various efforts to reſume it ; attempting to engage
                    Diocleſian in the ſame deſign. Being obliged to leave Rome, where he had bred
                    great confuſion, he went over into Gaul, where he was kindly received by
                    Conſtantine, the then acknowledged emperor of the weſt. But here alſo continuing
                    his intrigues, and endeavouring to force his own daughter and deſtroy her
                    huſband, he was detected, and condemn</p>
                <p>ed to die by whatever death he ſhould think proper *</p>
                <p>and Lactantius tells us that he choſe hanging.</p>
                <p>Upon the reſignation of the two emperors, the two Cæſars whom they had formerly
                    choſen were univerſally acknowledged as their ſucceſſors. Conſtantius. Chlorus,
                    who was ſo called from the plainneſs of his complexion, was virtuous, valiant,
                    and merciful. Ga-lerius, on the other hand, was brave, but brutal, incontinent,
                    and cruel. As there was ſuch a diſparity in their tempers, they readily agreed,
                    upon coming into full power, to divide the empire ; Conſtantius being appointed
                    to govern the weſtern parts; namely, Italy, Sicily, the greateſt part of Africa,
                    together with Spain, Gaul, Britain, and Germany : Galerius had the eaſtern parte
                    allotted to his ſhare ; to wit, Illyricum, Pannonia, Thrace, Macedonia, all the
                    provinces of Greece, and the Leſſer Aſia, together with Egypt, Syria, Judea, and
                    all the countries eaſtward. The greatneſs of the diviſion, however, ſoon induced
                    the emperors to take in two partners more, Severus and Maximin, who were made
                    Cæſars, and aſſiſted in the conducting of affairs ; ſo that the empire now was
                    under the guidance of four perſons, all inveſted with ſupreme authority.</p>
                <p>We are informed but of few particulars of the reign of Conſtantius, except a
                    detail of his character, which appears in every light moſt amiable. He was
                    frugal, chaſte, and temperate. His mercy and juſtice were equally conſpicuous in
                    his treatment of the Chriſtians, whom he would not ſuffer to be injured ; and
                    when at length perſuaded to diſplace all the Chriſtian officers of his houſehold
                    that would not change their religion, when ſome of them complied he ſent them
                    away in diſgrace ; alleging, that thoſe who were not true to their God, would
                    never be faithful to their prince.</p>
                <p>In the ſecond year of his reign he went over into Britain ; and leaving his ſon
                    Conſtantine as a kind of hoſtage in the court of his partner in the empire, took
                    up his reſidence at York. He there continued in the practice of his uſual
                    virtues ; till falling ſick, he began to think of appointing his ſon for his
                    ſucceſſor. He accordingly ſent for him with all ſpeed ; but he was paſt recovery
                    before his arrival : notwithſtanding, he received him with marks of the utmoſt
                    affection, and raiſing himſelf in his bed, gave him ſeveral uſeful inſtructions,
                    particularly recommending the Chriſtians to his protection. He then bequeathed
                    the empire to his care ; and crying out, that none but the pious Conſtantine
                    ſhould ſucceed him, he expired in his arms.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, Galerius, his partner in the empire, being informed of
                    Conſtantine’s advancement, teſtified the moſt ungovernable rage, and was even
                    going to condemn the meſſenger who brought him the account : but being
                    diſſuadect, he ſeemed to acquieſce in what he could not prevent, and ſent him
                    the marks of royalty j but at the fame time declared Severus emperor, in op.
                    poſition to his intereſts. Juſt about this time alſo, another pretender to the
                    empire ſtarted up. This was Maxentius, a perſon of mean extraction; but very
                    much favoured by the ſoldiers, whom he permitted to pillage at diſcretion. In
                    order to oppoſe Maxentius, Severus led a numerous army towards the gates of Rome
                    ; but his ſoldiers conſidering againſt whom they were to fight, immediately
                    abandoned him ; and ſhortly after he put an end to his own liſe, by opening his
                    veins. To revenge his death, Galerius marched into Italy, re-</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0452" facs="gri_33125011196389_0458.tif"/>
                <p>Solving to ruin the inhabitants, and to deſtroy the. whole ſenate. His ſoldiers,
                    however, upon approaching the capital began to waver in their reſolutions :
                    wherefore he was obliged to have recourſe to intreaties, imploring them not to
                    abandon him ; and, retiring by the ſame route by which he had advanced, made
                    Licinius, who was originally the ſon of a poor labourer in Dacia, Cæſar, in the
                    room of Severus who was ſlain. This ſeemed to be the laſt act of his power ; for
                    ſhortly after he was ſeized with a very extraordinary diſorder in his privities,
                    which baffled all the ſkill of his phyſicians, and carried him off, after he had
                    languiſhed in torments for near the ſpace of a year. His cruelty to the
                    Chri-ſtians was one of the many crimes alleged againſt him ; and their
                    hiſtorians have not failed to aggravate the circumſtances of his death as a
                    judgment from Heaven for his former impiety. However this be, he abated much of
                    his ſeverities againſt them on his deathbed ; and revoked thoſe edicts which he
                    had formerly publiſhed, tending to their perſecution, a little before his death.</p>
                <p>Conſtantine being thus delivered from his greateſt opponent, might now be
                    conſidered as poſſeſſing more power than any of his rivals who were yet
                    remaining. The empire was at that time divided between him and three others :
                    Maxentius, who governed in Rome, a perſon of a cruel diſpoſition, and a ſtedfaſt
                    ſupporter of paganiſm ; Licinius, who was adopted by Galerius, and commanded in
                    the eaſt ; and likewiſe Maximin, who had formerly been declared Cæſar with
                    Severus, and who alſo governed ſome of the eaſtern provinces.</p>
                <p>For ſome time all things ſeemed to wear a peaceful appearance ; till at length,
                    either ambition, or the tyrannical conduct of Maxentius, induced Conſtantine to
                    engage in an expedition to expel that commander from Rome, and to make the
                    proper preparations for marching into Italy. It was upon this occaſion that he
                    formed a reſolution which produced a mighty change in the politics as well as
                    the morals of mankind, and gave a new turn to the councils of the wife, and the
                    purſuſts ambition. One evening, as we are told by Euſebius, the army being upon
                    its march toward Rome, Conſtantine was taken up with various conſiderations upon
                    the fate of ſublunary things, and the dangers of his approaching expedition :
                    ſenſible of his own incapacity to ſucceed without divine aſſiſtance, he employed
                    his meditations upon the opinions that then were chiefly agitated among mankind,
                    and ſent up his ejaculations to Heaven to inſpire him with wiſdom to chooſe the
                    path he ought to purſue. It was then, as the ſun was declining, that there
                    ſuddenly appeared a pillar of light in the heavens, in the faſhion of a croſs,
                    with this inſcription, τoττn νίκη “ In this overcome.” So extraordinary an
                    appearance did not fail to create aſtoniſhment both in the emperor and his whole
                    army, who conſidered it as their dilpoſitions led them to believe. Thoſe who
                    were attached to paganiſm, prompted by their auſpices, pronounced it a moſt
                    inauſpicious omen, portending the moſt unfortunate events. But it made a
                    different impreſſion on the emperor’s mind ; who, as the account goes, was
                    farther encouraged by viſions the ſime night. He therefore, the day following,
                    cauſed a royal ſtandard to be made, like that which he had ſeen in the heavens ;
                    and commanded it to be carried before him in his wars, as an enſign of victory
                    and celeſtial protection. After this, he conſulted with ſeveral of the principal
                    teachers of Chriſtianity, and made a public avowal of that ſacred perſuafion.</p>
                <p>Conſtantine having thus attached his ſoldiers to his intereſt, who were moſtly
                    of the Chriſtian perſuafion, loſt no time in entering Italy with 90,000 foot and
                    8000 horſe ; and ſoon advanced to the very gates of Rome. The unfortunate
                    Maxentius, who had long given himſelf up to eaſe and debauchery, now began to <hi rend="sub">t</hi> make preparations when it was too late. He ſirlh put
                    in practice all the ſupeiſtitious rites which paganiſm_ taught to be neceſſary;
                    and then conſulted the Sibylline books ; from whence he was informed, that on
                    that great day the enemy of Rome ſhould periſh. This prediction, which was
                    equivocal, he applied to Conſtantine ; -wherefore, leaving all things in the
                    beſt poſture, he advanced from the city with an army of 100,000 foot and 18,000
                    horſe. The engagement was for ſome time fierce and bloody, till his cavalry
                    being routed, victory declared upon the ſide of his opponent, and be himſelf was
                    drowned in his flight by the breaking down of a bridge as he attempted to croſs
                    the river Tiber.</p>
                <p>Conſtantine, in conſequence of this victory, entering the city, diſclaimed all
                    praiſes which the ſenate and people were ready to offer ; alcribiug his ſucceſs
                    to a ſuperior power. He even cauſed the croſs, which he was ſaid to have ſeen in
                    the heavens, to be placed at the right of all his ſtatues, with this inſcription
                    : “That under the influence of that victorious croſs, Conſtantine had delivered
                    the city from the yoke of tyrannical power, and had reſtored the ſenate and
                    people of Rome to their ancient authority.” He afterwards ordained, that no
                    criminal ſhould for the future ſuffer death by the croſs ; which had formerly
                    been the moſt uſual way of puniſhing ſlaves convicted of capital offences.
                    Edicts were ſoon after iſſued, declaring that the Chriſtians ſhould be eaſed
                    from all their grievances, and received into places of truſt and authority. Thus
                    the new religion was ſeen at once to prevail over the whole Roman empire; and as
                    that enormous fabric had been built and guided upon pagan principles, it loſt a
                    great deal of it» ſtrength and coherence when thoſe principles were thus at once
                    ſubverted.</p>
                <p>Things continued in this ſtate for ſome time, Conſtantine all the while
                    contributing what was in his power to the intereſt of religion, and the revival
                    of learning, which had long been upon the decline, and was almoſt wholly extinct
                    in the empire. But in the midſt of theſe aſſiduities, the peace of the empire
                    was again diſturbed by the preparations of Maximin, who governed in the eaſt,
                    and who, deſirous of a full participation of power,, marched againſt Licinius
                    with a very numerous army. In conſequence of this ſtep, after many conflicts, a
                    general engagement enſued, in which Maximin ſuffered a total deteat ; many of
                    his troops were cut to pieces, and thoſe that ſurvived ſubmitted to the
                    conqueror. Maximin, however, having eſcaped the general carnage, once more put
                    himſelſ at the head of another army, reſolving to try the fortune of the field ;
                    but death prevented his deſign. As he died by-a very extraordinary kind of
                    madneſs, the Chriſtians, of whom he was the declared enemy, did not fail to
                    aſeribe his end to a judgment from heaven ; but this was the age in which falſe
                    judgments and falſe miracles made up the bulk of their uninſtructive hiſtory'.</p>

                <p>Conſtantine and Licinius thus remaining undiſputed poſſeſſors and partners in
                    the empire, all things promiſed a peaceable continuance of friendſhip and power.
                    However, it was ſoon found, that the fame ambition that aimed after a part,
                    would be content with nothing leſs than the whole. Ragan writers aſeribe the
                    ruptuιe between theſe two potentates to Conſtantine ; while the Chriſtians, on
                    the other hand, impute it wholly to Licinius. Both, perhaps, might have
                    concurred : lor Licinius is convicted of having perſecuted Chriſtianity, which
                    was ſo highly favoured by his rival ; and Conſtantine is known to have been the
                    firſt to begin the preparations far an open rupture. Both ſides exerted all
                    their power to make oppoſition ; and at the head of very formidable armies, came
                    to an engagement near Cybalis, in Pannonia. Conſtantine, previous to the battle,
                    in the midſt of his Chriſtian biſhops, begged the aſſiſtance of Heaven ; while
                    Licinius, with equal zeal, called upon the pagan prieſts, to intercede with the
                    gods in his favour. Conſtantine, after an obſtinate reſiſtance from the enemy,
                    became victorious ; took their camp ; and, after ſome time, compelled Licinius
                    to ſue ſor a truce, which was agreed upon. But this was of no long continuance;
                    ſor loon after, the war breaking out afreſh, and the rivals coming once more to
                    a general engagement, it proved deciſive. Licinius was entirely defeated, and
                    purſued by Conſtantine into Nicomedia, where he ſurrendered himſelf up to the
                    victor ; having firſt obtained an oath that his life ſhould be ſpared, and that
                    he ſhould be permitted to paſs the remainder of his days in retirement. This,
                    however, Conſtantine ſhortly after broke ; ſor either fearing his deſigns, or
                    finding him actually engaged in freſh conſpiracies, he commanded him to be put
                    to death, together with Martian his general, who ſome time before had been
                    created Cæſar.</p>
                <p>Conſtantine being now ſole monarch of the empire, without a rival to divide his
                    power, or any perſon ſrom whoſe claims he could have the leaſt apprehenſions,
                    reſolved to eſtabliſh Chriſtianity on ſo ſure a baſis, that no new regulations
                    ſhould ſhake it. He commanded that in all the provinces of the empire the orders
                    of the biſhops ſhould be exactly obeyed ; a privilege of which, in ſucceeding
                    times, theſe fathers made but a very indifferent uſe. He called alſo a general
                    council of theſe, to meet at Nicea, in order to repreſs the hereſies that had
                    already crept into the church, particularly that of Arius. To this place
                    repaired about 3 (8 biſhops, beſides a multitude of preſhyters and deacons,
                    together with the emperor himſelf ; who all, to about 17, concurred in
                    condemning the tenets of Arius ; who, with his aſſociates, was baniſhed into a
                    remote part of the empire.</p>
                <p>Having thus reſtored univerſal tranquillity to. the empire, he was not able to
                    ward off the calamities of a more domeſtic nature. As the hiſtories of that
                    period are entirely at variance with each other, it is not eaſy to. tell the
                    motives which induced him to put his wife Fauſta and his ſon Criſpus to death.
                    The moſt plauſible account is this : Fauſta the empreſs, who was a woman of
                    great beauty, but of extravagant deſires, had long, though ſecretly, loved
                    Criſpus, Conſtantine’s ſon by a former wiſe. She had tried every art to inſpire
                    this youth with a mutual paſſion; but, finding her more diſtant efforts
                    ineffectual, had even the conſidence to make him an open conſeſſion of her
                    deſires. This pro</p>
                <p>duced an explanation, which was fatal to both. Crif-pus received her addreſſes
                    with deteſtation ; and ſhe, to be revenged, accuſed him to the emperor.
                    Conſtantine, fired at once with jealoufy and rage, ordered him to die without a
                    hearing ; nor did his innocence appear till it was too late for redreſs. The
                    only reparation therefore that remained, was the putting Fauſta, the wicked
                    inſtrument of his former cruelty, to death ; which was accordingly executed upon
                    her, together with ſome others who had been accomplices in her falſehood and
                    treachery.</p>
                <p>But the private misfortunes of a few were not to be weighed againſt evils of a
                    more general nature, which the Roman empire ſhortly after experienced. Theſe
                    aroſe from a meaſure which this emperor conceived and executed, of transferring
                    the ſeat of the empire from Rome to Byzantium, or <hi rend="italic">Con</hi> <hi rend="italic">ſt</hi> <hi rend="italic">antinople,</hi> as it was afterwards called. Whatever might
                    have been the reaſons which induced him to this undertaking ; whether it was
                    becauſe he was offended at ſome affronts he received at Rome, or that he
                    ſuppoſed Conſtantinople more in the centre of the empire, or that he thought the
                    eaſtern parts more required his preſence, experience has ſhown that they were
                    weak and groundleſs. The empire had long before been in the moſt declining ſtate
                    ; but this in a great meaſure gave precipitation to its downfall. After this it
                    never reſumed its former ſplendor, but languiſhed.</p>
                <p>His firſt deſign was to build a city which he might make the capital of the
                    world ; and for this purpoſes he made choice of a ſituation at Chalcedon in Aſia
                    Minor ; but we are told, that in laying out the ground-plan, an eagle caught up
                    the line and flew with it over to Byzantium, a city which lay upon the oppoſite
                    ſide of the Boſphorus. Here, therefore, it was thought expedient to ſix the ſeat
                    of the empire and indeed nature ſeems to have formed it with all the
                    conveniences and all the beauties rvhich might induce power to make&lt;it
                    the ſeat of reſidence. It was ſituated on a plain that roſe gently from the
                    water ; it commanded that ſtrait which unites the Mediterranean with the Euxine
                    ſea, and was furniſhed with all the advantages which the moſt indulgent climate
                    could beſtow. This city,, therefore, he beautified with the moſt magniſicent
                    edifices ;. he divided it into 14 regions ; built a capitol, an amphitheatre,
                    many churches, and other public works ; and having thus rendered it equal to the
                    magnificence of his idea, he dedicated it in a very ſolemn manner to the God of
                    martyrs ; in about two years after, repairing thither with his.whole court.</p>
                <p>This removal produced no immediate alteration in the government of the empire ;
                    the inhabitants of Rome, tho’ with reluctance, ſubmitted to the change ; nor was
                    there for two or three years any diſturbance in the ſtate, until at length the
                    Goths, finding that the Romans had withdrawn all their garriſons along the
                    Danube, renewed their inroads, and. ravaged the country with unheard-of cruelty.
                    Conſtantine, however,, ſoon repreſſed their incurſions,- and ſo ſtraitened them,
                    that near 100,000 of their number periſhed by cold and hunger. Theſe and ſome
                    other inſurrections being happily ſuppreſſed, the government of the empire was
                    divided as follows. Conſtantine, the emperor’s, eldeſt ſon, commanded in Gaul
                    and the weſtern provinces ; Conſtantius governed Africa and Illyricum ; and</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0454" facs="gri_33125011196389_0460.tif"/>
                <p>Conſtans ruled in Italy. Dalmatius, the emperor’s brother, was ſent to defend
                    thoſe parts that bordered upon the Goths ; and Annibalianus, his nephew, had the
                    charge of Cappadocia and Armenia Minor. This dι-vilion of the empire ſtiſl
                    farther contributed to its downfall: for the united ſtrength of the ſtate being
                    no longer brought to repreſs invaſions, the barbarians fought with ſuperior
                    numbers ; and conquered at laſt, though often defeated. Conſtantine, however,
                    did not live to feel theſe calamities. The latter part of hie reign was peaceful
                    and ſplendid ; ambaſſadors from the remoteſt Indies came to acknowledge his
                    authority ; the Perſians, who were ready for freſh inroads, upon finding him
                    prepared to oppoſe, ſent humbly to deſire his friendſhip and forgivenneſs. He
                    was above 60 years old, and had reigned above 30 years, when he found bis health
                    began to -decline. To obviate the effects of bis diſorder, which was an
                    intermitting fever, he made uſe of the warm baths of the city ; but receiving no
                    benefit from thence, he removed for change of air to Helenopolis, a city which
                    he had built to the memory of his mother. His diſorder increaſing, he changed
                    again to Nicomedia ; where finding himſelf without hopes of recovery, he cauſed
                    himſelf to be Baptized ; and having ſoon after received the fâcrament, he
                    expired, after a memorable and active reign of 32 years. This monarch’s
                    character is repreſented to us in very different lights : the Chriſtian writers
                    of that time adorning it with every ſtrain of panegyric ; the heathens, on the
                    contrary, loading it with all the virulence of invective. He eſtabliſhed a
                    religion that continues the bleſſing of mankind ; but purſued a ſeheme of
                    politics that deſtroyed the empire.</p>
                <p>From the time of Conſtantine to the diviſion of the empire between Valentiniaa
                    and his brother Valens, the hiſtory of Rome is related under the article
                    Constantinople, where alſo that of the eaſtern part is carried down to the final
                    deſtruction of that city by the Turks. In the beginning of the reign of
                    Valentinian, the province of Libya Tripolitana was grievouſly oppreſſed by the
                    barbarians of the deſert, and almoſt equally ſo by Ro-manus its own governor.
                    His conduct was ſo exceedingly oppreſſive, that the inhabitants ſent a
                    deputation to Valentinian, complaining of their unhappy ſituation, and deſiring
                    redreſs. Palladius was accordingly ſent to inquire into the ſtate of the
                    province ; but being gained over by Romanus, he made a falſe report to the
                    emperor ; and thus the unhappy province was leſt a prey to the mercileſs
                    invaders and rapacious governor. During the reſt of this reign the barbarians
                    continued their inroads into the empire ; and among others, we find the Saxons
                    now putting in for a ſhare of the ſpoils of the ruined empire : however, their
                    army was at this time entirely cut off. At laſt Valentinian himſelf took the
                    field againſt theſe northern barbarians ; and entering the country of the Quadi,
                    deſtroyed all with fire and ſword. The barbarians on this were fain to ſue for
                    peace in a very humble manner ; but Valentinian, falling into a great paſſion
                    while ſpeaking to them, threatened to extirpate the whole nation at once. His
                    fury on this occaſion produced an apoplexy, or ſome ocher mortal diſorder ; for
                    he ſuddenly ſell down, and being conveyed by his attendants into his chamber, he
                    was ſeized with violent convulſive fits and contortions of all his limbs, in the
                    agonies of which he expired,</p>
                <p>in the year 375, the 55‘th of his age, and 12th of his reign.</p>
                <p>After the death of Valentinian, his ſon Gratian took upon him the imperial
                    dignity ; ſoon after becoming maſter of the whole empire by the death of Valens.
                    The tranſactions of his reign, and thoſe of his partner Ttieodoſius, are related
                    under the article Constantinople, n <hi rend="sup">0</hi> 77—89. The death of
                    Theodoſius gave the finiſhing ſtroke to the Roman affairs ; his ſon Ho-norius,
                    to whom he left the weſtern empire, being poſſeſſed of no abilities whatever,
                    and indeed ſeeming to have been but very little removed from an idiot. The
                    barbarians appear to have been abundantly ſenſible of the advantages offered
                    them by the death of Theodofius. He expired in the month of January ; and before
                    the acceſſion of ſpring, the Goths were in arms. The barbarian auxiliaries alſo
                    now declared their independency ; and along with their countrymen, furiouſly
                    aſſailed the declining empire. The Goths were now headed by an experienced
                    commander, their celebrated king Alaric ; who would have proved formidable even
                    in better times of the empire. He firſt over-ran Greece, which he accompliſhed
                    without oppoſition, through the treachery of the governor, who commanded the
                    troops that defended the paſs at Thermopylæ to retire at the approach of the
                    enemy. Athens, Corinth, Argos, Sparta, yielded without reſiſtance ; and the
                    whole country was ravaged and deſtroyed by the blood-thirſty barbarians. At
                    laſt, in the year 397, he was oppoſed by Stilicho, the general of Honorius, a
                    man of great valour and experience in war. The Goths were defeated with great
                    loſs, and afterwards beſieged in their camp ; but through miſtake or negligence
                    in the Roman commander, they were ſuffered to eſcape, and make themſelves
                    maſters of the province of Epirus. Alaric then, having found means to conclude a
                    treaty with the miniſters of Conſtantinople, Stilicho was obliged to retire.</p>
                <p>Not long after this, Alaric invaded Italy itſelf. The emperor, ſtruck with
                    terror, would have abandoned the country and fled into Gaul : but this
                    diſgracefui and pernicious meaſure was oppoſed by Stilicho ; who propoſed to the
                    court of Honorius, at that time at Milan, that if they would maintain their
                    ground during his abſence, he would ſoon return with an army capable of oppoſing
                    the barbarians. This being agreed to, Stilicho immediately ſet out for Rhætia,
                    where the •moſt conſiderable body of the Roman forces at that time was, and
                    collected his troops with the utmoſt diligence. But in the mean time Honorius
                    was in the greateſt danger ; having been obliged to take refuge in the town of
                    Aſta in Piedmont. To this place the Goths inſtantly laid ſiege, and a
                    capitulation had been propoſed, when the drooping ſpirits of Honorius were at
                    once revived by the arrival of Stilicho, whom he had ſo long expected. The Goths
                    were now beſieged in their turn, and obliged to come to a deciſive battle at
                    Pollentia. The engagement laſted the whole day ; but at laſt the Goths were
                    compelled to retreat. Their camp was inſtantly inveſted ; their entrenchments
                    forced with great ſlaughter; the wife of Alaric was taken, with all the wealth
                    which had been amaſſed in plundering Greece ; while many thouſands of Roman
                    priſoners were releaſed from the moſt deplorable ſlavery. The victory, however,
                    was not ſo deciſive but that A ;</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0455" facs="gri_33125011196389_0461.tif"/>
                <p>laric continued ſtill extremely formidable ; and Stilicho choſe rather to
                    conclude a treaty with him, and allow him an annual penſion, than to continue
                    the war with vigour. Alaric, who was not very ſcrupulous in his obſervance of
                    this treaty, in his retreat attempted to make himſelf maſter of the city of
                    Verona : but Stilicho coming up with him near that place, gave him a terrible
                    defeat, in which the loſs was little leſs than it had been at Pollentia ; after
                    which he effected a retreat out of Italy, but not without the greateſt
                    difficulty and danger.</p>
                <p>Italy being thus happily delivered, Honorius entered Rome in triumph, having
                    Stilicho along with him in the triumphal chariot., On his entry into the city,
                    he aboliſhed the ſhows of gladiators ; which, though forbidden by Conſtantine,
                    had been tolerated by his ſucceſſors, and even by Ttieodoſius himſelf, out of
                    complaiſance to the people, who were beyond meaſure fond of that inhuman
                    diverſion. However, ſoon after, the emperor was obliged to leave the metropolis
                    and retire to Ravenna, in order to ſecure himſelf from the barbarians, who now
                    broke in upon the empire on all ſides. Such multitudes now made their
                    appearance, that it is not a little difficult to account for their ſudden
                    emigration. Mr Gibbon accounts for it from a ſuppoſed revolution in the
                    north-eaſtem parts of China. “ The Chineſe annals (ſays he), as they have been
                    interpreted by the learned induſtry of the preſent age, may be uſefully applied
                    to reveal the ſecret and remote cauſes of the fall of the Roman empire. The
                    extenſive territory to the north of the great wall was poſſeſſed, after the
                    flight of the Huns, by the victorious Sienpi ; who were ſometimes broken into
                    independent tribes, and ſometimes re-united under a ſupreme chief ; till at
                    length ſtyling themſelves <hi rend="italic">Topa,</hi> or “ maſters of the
                    earth,” they acquired a more ſolid conſiſtence, and a more formidable power. The
                    Topa ſoon compelled the paſtoral nations of the eaſtern deſert to acknowledge
                    the ſuperiority of their arms ; they invaded China in a period of weakneſs and
                    inteſtine diſcord ; and theſe fortunate Tartars, adopting the laws and manners
                    of the vanquiſhed people, founded an imperial dy-naſty, which reigned near 160
                    years over the northern provinces of the monarchy. Some generations before they
                    aſcended the throne of China, one of the Topa princes had enlifted in his
                    cavalry a ſlave of the name of <hi rend="italic">Moko,</hi> renowned for his
                    valour ; but who was tempted, by the ſear of puniſhment, to deſert his ſtandard,
                    and to range the deſert at the head of ιoo followers. This gang of robbers and
                    outlaws ſwelled into a camp, a tribe, a numerous people, diſtinguiſhed by the
                    appellation of <hi rend="italic">Geougerι ;</hi> and their hereditary
                    chieftains, the poſterity of Mokυ the ſlave, aſſumed their rank among the
                    Scythian monarchs. The youth Tυulun, the greateſt of his deſcendants, was
                    exerciſed by thoſe misfortunes which are the ſchool of heroes. He bravely
                    ſtruggled with adverſity, broke the imperious yoke of the Topa, and became the
                    legiſlator of his nation, and the conqueror of Tartary. His troops were
                    diſtributed into regular bands of ιoo and of iqoo men ; cowards were ſtoned to
                    death ; the moſt ſplendid honours were propoſed as the reward of valour ; and
                    Toulun, who had knowledge enough to deſpiſe the learning of China, adopted only
                    ſuch arts and inſtitutions as were favourable to the military ſpirit of his
                    government. His tents, which he removed in the winter ſeaſon to a more ſouthern
                    latitude, were pitched during the ſummer on the fruitful banks of the Selinga,
                    His conqueſts ſtretched from the Corea far beyond the river Irtiſh. He
                    vanquiſhed, in the country to the north of the Caf-pian ſea, the nation of the
                    Huns ; and the new title of <hi rend="italic">Khan,</hi> on <hi rend="italic">Gagan,</hi> expreſſed the ſame and power which he derived from this
                    memorable victory.</p>
                <p>“ The chain of events is interrupted, or rather is concealed, as it paſſes from
                    the Volga to the Viſtula, through the dark interval which ſeparates the extreme
                    limits of the Chineſe and of the Roman geography. Yet the temper of the
                    barbarians, and the experience of ſucceſſive emigrations, ſufficiently declare,
                    that the Huns, who were oppreſſed by the arms of the Geougen <hi rend="sub">t</hi> ſoon withdrew from the preſence of an inſulting victor. The countries
                    towards the Euxine were already occupied by their kindred tribes ; and their
                    haſty flight, which they ſoon converted into a bold attack, would more naturally
                    be directed towards the rich and level plains through which the Viſtula gently
                    flows into the Baltic ſea. The north muſt again have been alarmed and agitated
                    by the invaſion of the Huns ; and the nations- who retreated before them muſt
                    have preſſed with incumbent weight on the confines of Germany. The inhabitants
                    of thoſe regions which the ancients have aſſigned to the Suevi, the Vandals, and
                    the Burgundians, might embrace the resolution of abandoning to the fugitives of
                    Sarmatia their woods and moraſſes ; or at leaſt of diſeharging their ſuperfluous
                    numbers on the provinces of the Roman empire. About ſour years after the
                    victorious Tυulun had aſſumed the title of <hi rend="italic">khan of the
                        Geougen,</hi> another barbarian, the haughty Rho-dogaſt, or Radagaiſus,
                    marched from the northern extremities of Germany almoſt to the gates of Rome,
                    and left the remains of his army to atchieve the deſtruction of the weſt. The
                    Vandals, the Suevi, and the Burgundians, formed the ſtrength of this mighty hoſt
                    : but the Alani, who had found an hoſpitable reception in their new feats, added
                    their active cavalry to the heavy infantry of the Germans ; and the Gothic
                    adventurers crowded ſo eagerly to the ſtandard of Radagaiſus, that by ſome
                    hiſtorians he has been ſtyled the <hi rend="italic">king of the Goths.</hi> Twelve thouſand warriors, diſtinguiſhed above the vulgar by their noble birth or
                    their valiant deeds, glittered in the van ; and the whole multitude, which was
                    not leſs than 20c,000 fighting men, might be increaſed by the acceſſion of
                    women, of children, and of ſlaves, to the amount of 400,∞0 perſons. This
                    formidable emigration iſſued from the ſame coaſt of the Baltic which had poured
                    forth the myriads of the Cimbri and Teutones to aſſault Rome and Italy in the
                    vigour of the republic. After the departure of thoſe barbarians, their native
                    country, which was marked by the veſtiges of their greatneſs, long ramparts, and
                    gigantic moles, remained during ſome ages a vaſt and dreary ſolitude ; till the
                    human ſpecies was renewed by the powers of generation, and the vacancy was
                    filled. up by the influx of new inhabitants. The nations who now uſurp an
                    extent, of land which they are unable to cultivate, would ſoon be aſſiſted by
                    the indu» ſtrious poverty of their neighbours, if the government of Europe did
                    not protect the claims of dominion and property.</p>
                <p>“ The correſpondence of nations was in that age ſo</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0456" facs="gri_33125011196389_0462.tif"/>
                <p>imperfect and precarious, that the revolutions of the north might eſeape the
                    knowledge of the court of Ravenna ; till the dark cloud which was collected
                    along the coaſt of the Baltic burſt in thunder upon the banks of the Upper
                    Danube. The emperor of the weft, if his miniſters diſturbed his amuſements by
                    the news of the impending danger, was ſatisfied,with being the occaſion and the
                    ſpectator of the war. The ſafety of Rome was intruſted to the counſels and the
                    ſword of Stilicho ; but ſuch was the feeble and exhauſted ſtatc of the empire,
                    that it was impoſſible to reſtore the fortifications of the Danube, or to
                    prevent, by a vigorous effort, the invaſion of the Germans. The hopes of the
                    vigilant miniſter of Honorius were confined to the defence of Italy. He once
                    more abandoned the provinces; recalled the troops ; preſſed the new levies,
                    which were rigorouſly exacted, and puſillanimouſly eluded ; employed the moſt
                    efficacious means to arreſt or allure the deſerters ; and offered the gift of
                    freedom, and of two pieces of gold, to all the ſlaves who would enliſt. By theſe
                    efforts he painfully collected from the ſubjects of a great empire an army of
                    30,000 or 40,000 men ; which, in the days of Scipio or Camillus, would have been
                    inſtantly furniſhed by the free citizens of the territory of Rome. The 30
                    legions of Stilicho were reinforced by a large body of barbarian auxiliaries ;
                    the faithful Alani were perſonally attached to his ſervice ; and the troops of
                    Huns and of Goths, who inarched under the banners of their native princes Hulden
                    and Sarus, were animated by intereſt and reſentment to oppoſe the ambition of
                    Radagaiſus. The king of the confederate Germans paſſed, without reſiſtance, the
                    Alps, the Po, and the Appenine : leaving on one hand the inacceſſible palace of
                    Honorius, ſe-curely buried among the marſhes of Ravenna; and on the*other, the
                    camp of Stilicho, who had fixed his head-quarters at Ticinum, or Pavia, but who
                    ſeems to have avoided a deciſive battle till he had aſſembled his diſtant
                    forces. Many cities of Italy were pillaged, or deſtroyed ; and the ſiege of
                    Florence by Radagaiſus is one of the earlieſt events in the hiſtory of that
                    celebrated republic, whoſe firmneſs checked and delayed the unlkilful fury of
                    the barbarians. The ſenate and people trembled at their approach within 180
                    miles of</p>
                <p>Rome ; and anxiouſly compared the danger which they had eſcaped with the new
                    perils to which they were expoſed. Alaric was a Chriſtian and a ſoldier, the
                    leader of a diſciplined army ; who underſtood the laws of war, who reſpected the
                    ſanctity of treaties, and who had familiarly converſed with the fubjects of the
                    empire in the ſame camps and the ſame churches. The ſavage Radagaiſus was a
                    ſtranger to the manners, the religion, and even the language, of the civilized
                    nations of the fouth. The fierceneſs of his temper was exaſperated by cruel
                    ſuperſtition ; and it was univerſally believed, that he had bound himſelf by a
                    ſolemn vow to reduce the city into a heap of ſtones and aſhes, and to ſacriſice
                    the moſt illuſtrious of the Roman ſenators on the altars of thoſe gods who were
                    appeaſed by human blood. The public danger, which ſhould have reconciled all
                    domeſtic animoſities, diſplayed the incurable madneſs of religious faction. The
                    oppreſſed votaries of Jupiter and Mercury reſpected, in the implacable enemy of
                    Rome, the character of a devout pagan ; loudly declared, that they were more
                    apprehenſive of the ſacrifices than of the arms of Radagai</p>
                <p>ſus ; and fect <hi rend="sup">,</hi> etly rejoiced in the calamities of their
                    country, which condemned the faith of their Chriſtian adverfaries.</p>
                <p>“ Florence was reduced to the laſt extremity ; and the fainting courage of the
                    citizens was ſupported only by the authority of St Ambroſe, who had communicated
                    in a dream the promiſe of a ſpeedy deliverance. On a ſudden they beheld from
                    their walls the banners of Stilicho, who advanced with his united force to the
                    relief of the faithful city-, and who ſoon marked that fatal ſpot ſor the grave
                    of the barbarian hoſt. The apparent contradictions of thoſe writers who
                    variouſly relate the defeat of Radagaiſus, may be reconciled without offering
                    much violence to their reſpective teſtimonies. Oroſius and Auguſtin, who were
                    intimately connected by friendſhip and religion, aſeribe this miraculous victory
                    to the providence of God rather than to the valour of man. They ſtrictly exclude
                    every idea of chance, or even of bloodſhed ; and poſitively affirm, that the
                    Romans, whoſe camp was the ſcene of plenty and idleneſs, enjoyed the diſtreſs of
                    the barbarians, ſlowly expiring on the ſharp and barren ridge of the hills of
                    Fæfulæ, which riſe above the city of Florence. Their extravagant aſſertion, that
                    not a ſingle ſoldier of the Chriſtian army was killed, or even wounded, may be
                    diſmiſſed with ſilent contempt ; but the reſt of the narrative of Auguſtin and
                    Oroſius is conſiſtent with the ſtate of the war and the character of Stilicho.
                    Conſcious that he commanded the laſt army of the republic, his prudence would
                    not expoſe it in the open field to the headſtrong fury of the Germans. The
                    method of ſurrounding the enemy with ſtrong lines of circumvallation, which he
                    had twice employed againſt the Gothic king, was repeated on a larger ſcale, and
                    with more conſiderable effect. The examples of Cæſar muſt have been familiar to
                    the moſt illiterate of the Roman warriors ; and the fortifications of
                    Dyrrhachium, which connected 24 caſtles by a perpetual ditch and rampart of 15
                    miles, afforded the model of an intrenchment which might confine and ſtarve the
                    moſt numerous hoſt of barbarians. The Roman troops had leſs degenerated from the
                    induſtry than from the valour of their anceſtors ; and if the ſervile and
                    laborious work offended the pride of the ſoldiers, Tuſcany could ſupply many
                    thouſand peaſants, who would labour, though perhaps they would</p>
                <p>not fight, for the ſalvation of their native country.— The impriſoned multitude
                    of horſes and men was gradually deſtroyed by famine, rather than by the ſword ;
                    but the Romans were expoſed, during the progreſs of ſuch an extenſive work, to
                    the frequent attacks of an impatient enemy. The deſpair of the hungry barbarians
                    would precipitate them againſt the fortifications of Stilicho ; the general
                    might ſometimes indulge the ardour of his brave auxiliaries, who eagerly preſſed
                    to aſſault the camp of the Germans ; and theſe various incidents might produce
                    the ſharp and bloody conflicts which dignify the narrative of Zoſimus, and the
                    Chronicles of Proſper and Marcellinus. A ſeaſonable ſupply ot men and proviſions
                    had been introduced into the walls of Florence ; and the famiſhed hoſt of
                    Radagaiſus was in its turn beſieged. The proud monarch of ſo many warlike
                    nations, after the loſs of his braveſt warriors, was reduced to confide either
                    in the faith of a capitulation, or in the clemency of Stilicho. But the death of
                    the royal captive, who was ignominiouſly beheaded, diſgraced the triumph of Rome
                    and of Chriſtianity ; and</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0457" facs="gri_33125011196389_0463.tif"/>
                <p>the ſhort delay of his execution was ſufficient to brand the conqueror with the
                    guilt of cool and deliberate cruelty. The famiſhed Germans who eſcaped the fury
                    of the auxiliaries were ſold as ſlaves, at the contemptible price of as many
                    ſingle pieces of gold : but the difference of food and climate ſwept away great
                    numbers of thoſe unhappy ſtrangers; and it was obſerved, that the inhuman
                    purchaſers, inſtead of reaping the fruit of their labour, were ſoon obliged to
                    add to it the expence of interring them. Stilicho informed the emperor and the
                    ſenate of his ſucceſs ; and deſerved a ſecond time the glorious title of <hi
                        rend="italic"> Deliverer of Italy.</hi></p>
                <p>“ The fame of the victory, and more eſpecially of the miracle, has encouraged a
                    vain perſuafion, that the whole army, or rather nation, of Germans, who migrated
                    from the ſhores of the Baltic, miſerably periſhed under the walls of Florence.
                    Such indeed was the fate of Radagaiſus himſelf, of his brave and faithful
                    companions, and of more than one-third of the various multitude of Sueves and
                    Vandals, of Alani and Burgundians, who adhered to the ſtandard of their general.
                    The union of ſuch an army might excite our ſurpriſe, but the cauſes of
                    ſeparation are obvious and forcible ; they were the pride of birth, the
                    inſolence of valour, the jealouſy of command, the impatience of ſubordination,
                    and the obſtinate conflict of opinions, of intereſts, and of paf-ſions, among ſo
                    many kings and warriors, who were untaught to yield or to obey. Alter the defeat
                    of Radagaiſus, two parts of the German hoſt, which muſt have exceeded the number
                    of 100,000 men, ſtill remained in arms between the Apennine and the Alps, or
                    between the Alps and the Danube. It is uncertain whether they attempted to
                    revenge the death of their general : but their irregular fury was ſoon diverted
                    by the prudence and firmneſs of Stilicho, who oppoſed their march, and
                    facilitated their retreat ; who conſidered the ſafety of Rome and Italy as the
                    great object of his care, and who ſacriſiced with too much indifference the
                    wealth and tranquillity of the diſtant provinces. The barbarians acquired, ſrom
                    the junction of ſome Pannonian deſerters, the knowledge of the country and of
                    the roads ; and the invaſion of Gaul, which Alaric had deſigned, was executed by
                    the remains of the great army of Radagaiſus.</p>
                <p>“ Yet if they expected to derive any aſſiſtance ſrom ihe tribes of Germany who
                    inhabited-the banks of the Rhine, their hopes were diſappointed. The Alemanni
                    preſerved a ſtate of inactive neutrality ; and the Franks diſtinguiſhed their
                    zeal and courage in the defence of the empire. In the rapid progreſs down the
                    Rhine, which was the firſt act of the adminiſtration of Stilicho, he had applied
                    himſelf with peculiar attention to ſecure the alliance of the warlike Franks,
                    and to remove the irreconcileable enemies of peace and of the republic.
                    Marcomir, one of their kings, was publicly convicted before the tribunal of the
                    Roman magiſtrate of violating the faith of treaties. He was ſentenced to a mild,
                    but diſtant exile, in the province of Tuſcany ; and this degradation of the
                    regal dignity was ſo far from exciting the reſentment of his ſubjects, that they
                    puniſhed with death the turbulent Sunno, who attempted to revenge his brother,
                    and maintained a dutiful allegiance to the princes who were eſtabliſhed on the
                    throne by the choice of Stilicho. When the limits of Gaul and Germany were
                    ſhaken by the northern emigration, the Franks</p>
                <p>bravely encountered the ſingle force of the Vandals ; who, regardleſs of the
                    leffons of adverſity, had again ſeparated their troops from the ſtandard of
                    their barbarian allies. They paid the penalty of their raſhneſs ; and 20,000
                    Vandals, with their king Godigiſclus, were ſlain in the field of battle. The
                    whole people muſt have been extirpated, if the ſquadrons of the Alani, advancing
                    to their relief, had not trampled down the infantry of the Franks ; who, after
                    an honourable reſiſtance, were compelled to relinquiſh the unequal conteſt. The
                    victorious confederates purfued their march ; and on the laſt day of the year,
                    in a ſeaſon when the waters of the Rhine w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> ere moſt
                    probably frozen, they entered without oppoſition the defenceleſs provinces of
                    Gaul. This memorable paſſage of the Suevi, the Vandals, the Alani, and the
                    Burgundians, who never afterwards retreated, may be conſidered as the fail of
                    the Roman empire in the countries beyond the Alps ; and the barriers, which had
                    ſo long ſeparated the ſavage and the civilized nations of the earth, w <hi
                        rend="sup"> ,</hi> ere ſrom that fatal moment levelled with the ground.</p>
                <p>“ While the peace of Germany was ſecured by the attachment of the Franks and the
                    neutrality of the Alemanni, the ſubjects of Rome, unconſeious of their
                    approaching calamities, enjoyed a ſtate of quiet and proſperity, which had
                    ſeldom bleſſed the frontiers of Gaul. Their flocks and herds were permitted to
                    graze in the paſtures of the barbarians ; their huntſmen penetrated, without
                    fear or danger, into the darkeſt receſſes of the Hercynian wood. The banks of
                    the Rhine were crowned, like thoſe of the Tiber, with elegant houſes and weſt
                    cultivated farms ; and if a poet deſcend-ed the river, he might expreſs his
                    doubt on which ſide was ſituated the territory of the Romans. This ſcene of
                    peace and plenty was ſuddenly changed into a deſert, and the proſpect of the
                    ſmoking ruins could alone diſtinguiſh the ſolitude of nature from the deſolation
                    of man. The flouriſhing city of Mentz was ſurpriſed and deſtroyed ; and many
                    thouſand Chriſtians were inhumanly maſſacred in the church. Worms periſhed after
                    a long and obſtinate ſiege : Straſhurg, Spires, Rheims, Tournay, Aras, Amiens,
                    experienced the cruel oppreſſion of the German yoke ; and the conſuming flames
                    of war ſpread from the banks of the Rhine over the greateſt part of the 17
                    provinces of Gaul. That rich and extenſive country, as far as the Ocean, the
                    Alps, and the Pyrenees, was delivered to the barbarians, who drove before them,
                    in a promiſeuous crowd, the biſhop, the ſenator, and the virgin, laden with the
                    ſpoils of their houſes and altars.”</p>
                <p>In the midſt of theſe calamities a revolt happened in Britain, where one
                    Conſtantine, a common ſoldier, was raiſed to the imperial throne, merely for the
                    ſake of his name. However, he ſeems to have been a man of conſiderable
                    abilities, and by no means unfit for the high dignity to which he was raiſed. He
                    governed Britain with great proſperity ; paſſed over into Gaul and Spain, the
                    inhabitants of which ſubmitted without oppoſition, being glad of any protector
                    whatever from the barbarians. Honorius, incapable of defending the empire, or
                    repreſſing the revolt, was obliged to acknowledge him for his partner in the
                    empire. In the mean time, Alaric, with his Goths, threatened a new invaſion
                    unleſs he was paid a certain ſum of money. Stilicho is ſaid to have occaſioned
                    this demand, and to have inſiſt-</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0458" facs="gri_33125011196389_0464.tif"/>
                <p>cd upon ſending him the money he demanded ; and this was th« cauſe of his
                    diſgrace and death, which happened ſoon after, with the extirpation of his
                    family and ſriends. Nay, ſuch was the general hatred of this unfortunate
                    miniſter, that the ſoldiers quartered in the cities of Italy no ſooner heard of
                    his death, than they murdered the wives and children of the barbarians whom
                    Stilicho had taken into the ſervice of Honorius. The enraged huſhands went over
                    to Alaric, who made a new demand of money ; which not being readily ſent, he
                    laid ſiege to Rome, and would have taken it, had not the emperor complied with
                    his demand. The ranſom of the city was 5000 pounds of gold, 30,000 of ſilver,
                    40c. o ſilk garments, 3000 ſhins dyed purple, and 3000 pounds of pepper. On this
                    occaſion the heathen temples were ſtripped of their remaining ornaments, and
                    among others of the ſtatue of Valour ; which the pagans did not fail to
                    interpret as a preſage of the ſpeedy ruin of the ſtate.</p>
                <p>Alaric having received this treaſure, departed ſor a ſhort time : but ſoon after
                    he again blocked up the city with a numerous army ; and again an accommodation
                    with Honorius was ſet on foot. However, for ſome reaſons which do not clearly
                    appear, the treaty was broken off, Rome was a third time beſieged, and at laſt
                    taken and plundered. Alaric, when upqn the point of breaking into the city,
                    addreſſing his ſoldiers, told them, that all the wealth in it was theirs, and
                    therefore he gave them full liberty to ſeize it ; but at the ſame time he
                    ſtrictly enjoined them to ſhed the blood of none but ſuch as they ſhould find in
                    arms ; and above all, to ſpare thoſe 5vh0 ſhould take ſanctuary in the holy
                    places, eſpecially in the churches of the apoſtles St Peter and St Paul ; which
                    he named, becauſe they w <hi rend="sup">τ</hi> ere moſt ſpacious, and
                    conſequently capable of affording an aſylum to great numbers of people. Having
                    given theſe orders, he abandoned the city to his Goths, who treated it no
                    better, according to St Jerome, than the Greeks are ſaid to have treated ancient
                    Troy ; for after having plundered it for the ſpace of three, or, as others will
                    have it, of ſix days, they ſet fire to it in ſeveral places ; ſo that the
                    ſtately palace of Salluſt, and many other magnificent buildings, were reduced to
                    aſhes ; nay, Procopius writes, that there was not in the whole city one houſe
                    left entire ; and both St Jerome and Philoſtorgius aſſert, that the great
                    metropolis of the empire was reduced to an heap of aſhes and ruins. Though many
                    of the Goths, purſuant to the orders of their general, refrained from ſhedding
                    the blood of ſuch as made no reſiſtance ; yet others, more cruel and
                    blood-thirſty, maſſacred all they met : ſo that the ſtreets in ſome quarters of
                    the city were ſeen covered with dead bodies, and ſwimming. in blood. However,
                    not the leaſt injury was offered to thoſe who fled to the churches ; nay, the
                    Goths themſelves conveyed thither, as to places of ſafety, ſuch as they were
                    deſirous ſhould be ſpared. Many of the ſtatues of the gods that had been leſt
                    entire by</p>
                <p>the emperors is excellent pieces of art, were on this occaſion deſtroyed, either
                    by the Goths, who, though moſtly Arians, were zealous Chriſtians, or by a
                    dreadful ſtorm of thunder and lightning which fell at the ſame time upon the
                    city, as if it had been ſent on purpoſe to complete with them the deſtruction of
                    idolatry, and aboliſh the ſmall remains of pagan ſuperſtition. However,
                    notwithſtanding theſe accountε, ſome affirm that</p>
                <p>the city ſuffered very little at this time, not ſo much as when it was taken by
                    Charles V.</p>
                <p>Alaric did not long ſurvive the taking of Rome, being cut off by a violent fit
                    of ſickneſs in the neighbourhood of Rhegium. After his death the affairs of
                    Honorius ſeemed a little to revive by the defeat and death of Conſtantine and
                    ſome other uſurpers ; but the provinces of Gaul, Britain, and Spain, were now <hi rend="sup">r</hi> almoſt entirely occupied by barbarians ; in which
                    ſtate they continued till the death of Honorius, which happened in the year 423,
                    after an unfortunate reign of 28 years.</p>
                <p>After ſome uſurpations which took place on the death of Honorius, his nephew
                    Valentinian III. was declared emperor of the weſt, and his mother Placidia
                    regent during his minority. He was ſcarce ſeated on the throne, when the empire
                    was attacked by the Huns under the celebrated Attila. The Romans, however,
                    wretched and degenerate as they were, had they been unanimous, would even yet
                    have been ſuperior to their enemies. The empreſs then had two celebrated
                    generals, Bonifacius and Aetius ; who by their union might have ſaved the empire
                    : but unhappily, through the treachery of Aetius, Bonifacius was obliged to
                    revolt ; and a civil war enſued, in which he loſt his life. Aetius, however,
                    notwithſtanding his treachery, was pardoned, and put at the head of the forces
                    of the empire. He defended it againſt Attila with great ſpirit and ſucceſs,
                    notwithſtanding the deplorable ſituation of affairs, till he was murdered by
                    Valentinian with his own hand, on a ſuſpicion that he aſpired to the empire. But
                    in the mean time the provinces, except Italy itſelf, were totally over·run by
                    the barbarians. Genſeric king of the Vandals ravaged Africa and Sicily ; the
                    Goths, Suevians, Burgundians, &amp;c. had taken poſſeſſion of Gaul and Spain
                    ; and the Britons were oppreſſed by the Scots and Pict⅞, ſo that they were
                    obliged to call in the Saxons to their aſſiſtance, as is related under the
                    article England. In the year 455, Valentinian was murdered by one Maximus, whoſe
                    wife he had raviſhed. Maximus immediately aſſumed the empire ; but felt ſuch
                    violent anxieties, that he deſigned to reſign it and fly out of Italy, in order
                    to enjoy the quiet of a private liſe. However, being diſſuaded from this by his
                    friends, and his own wife dying ſoon after, he forced the empreſs Eudoxia to
                    marry him. Eudoxia, who had tenderly loved Valentinian, provoked beyond meaſure
                    at being married to his murderer, invited Genſeric king of the Vandals into
                    Italy. This proved a moſt fatal ſeheme : for Genſeric immediately appeared
                    before Rome ; a violent tumult enſued, in which Maximus loſt his liſe ; and the
                    city was taken and plundered by Genſeric, who carried off what had been left by
                    the Goths. A veſſel was loaded with coſtly ſtatues ; half the covering of the
                    capitol, which was of braſs plated over with gold ; ſacred veſſels enriched with
                    precious ſtones ; and thoſe which had been taken by Titus out of the temple of
                    Jeruſalem ; all of which were loſt with</p>
                <p>the veſſel in its paſſage to Africa.</p>
                <p>Nothing could now be more deplorable than the ſtate</p>
                <p>of the Roman affairs : nevertheleſs, the empire continued to exiſt for ſome
                    years longer ; and even ſeemed to revive for a little under Marjoriar&gt;us,
                    who was declared emperor in 458. He was a man of great courage, and poſſeſſed of
                    many other excellent qualities. He</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r02-0459" facs="gri_33125011196389_0465.tif"/>
                <p>defeated the Vandals, and drove them out of Italy. With great labour he fitted
                    out a fleet, of which the Romans had been long deſtitute. With this he deſigned
                    to paſs over into Africa ; but, it being ſurpriſed and burnt by the enemy, he
                    himſelf was ſoon after murdered by one Ricimer a Goth, who had long governed
                    every thing with an abſolute ſway. After the death of Marjorianus, one Anthemius
                    was raiſed to the empire : but beginning to counteract Ricimer, the latter
                    openly revolted, beſieged and took Rome ; where he committed innumerable
                    cruelties, among the reſt putting to death the unhappy emperor Anthemius, and
                    raiſing one Olybius to the empire. The tranſactions of his reign were very few,
                    as he died ſoon after his acceſſion. On his death, one Glycerius uſurped the
                    empire. He was depoſed in 474, and one Julius Nepos had the name of <hi
                        rend="italic"> emperor.</hi> He was driven out the next year by his general
                    Oreſtes, who cauſed his ſon Auguſtus or Auguſtulus to be proclaimed emperor. But
                    the following year, 476, the barbarians who ſerved in the Roman armies, and were
                    diſtinguiſhed with the title of allies, demanded, as a reward for their
                    ſervices, the third part of the lands in Italy ; pretending, that the whole
                    country, which they had ſo often defended, belonged of right to them. As Oreſtes
                    refuſed to comply with this inſolent demand, they reſolved to do themſelves
                    juſtice, as they called it ; and, openly revolting, choſe one Odoacer for their
                    leader. Odoacer was, according to Ennodius, meanly born, and only a private, man
                    in the guards of the emperor Auguſtulus, when the barbarians revolting, choſe
                    him for their leader. However, he is ſaid to have been a man of uncommon parts,
                    equally capable of commanding an army and governing a ſtate. Having left his own
                    country when he was yet very young, to ſerve in Italy, as he was of</p>
                <p>a ſtature remarkably tall, he was admitted among the emperor’s guards, and
                    continued in that ſtation till the preſent year ; when, putting himſelf at the
                    head of the barbarians in the Roman pay, who, though of different nations, had,
                    with one conſent, choſen him for their leader, he marched againſt Oreſtes and
                    his ſon Auguſtulus, who ſtill refuſed to give them any ſhare of the lands in
                    Italy.</p>
                <p>As the Roman troops were inferior, both in number and valour, to the barbarians,
                    Oreſtes took refuge in Pavia, at that time one of the beſt fortified cities in
                    Italy : but Odoacer, inveſting the place without loſs of time, took it ſoon
                    after by aſſault, gave ſt up to be plundered by the ſoldiers, and then ſet fire
                    to it; which reduced moſt of the houſes, and two churches, to aſhes. Oreſtes was
                    taken priſoner, and brought to Odoacer, who carried him to Placentia, and there
                    cauſed him to be put to death, on the 28th of Auguſt, the day on which he had
                    driven Nepos out of Ravenna, and obliged him to abandon the empire. From
                    Placentia, Odoacer marched ſtraight to Ravenha, where he found Paul, the brother
                    of Oreſtes, and the young emperor Auguſtulus. The former he immediately put to
                    death ; but ſparing Auguſtulus, in conſideration of his youth, he ſtripped him
                    of the enſigns of the imperial dignity, and confined him to Lucullanum, a caſtle
                    in Campania ; where he was, by Odoacer’« orders, treated with great humanity,
                    and allowed an handſome maintenance to ſupport himſelf and his relations. Rome
                    readily ſubmitted to the conqueror, who immediately cauſed</p>
                <p>himſelſ to be proclaimed king of Italy, but would not aſſume the purple, or any
                    other mark of the imperial dignity. Thus failed the very name of an empire in
                    the Weſt. Britain had been long ſince abandoned by the Romans ; Spain was held
                    by the Goths and Sue-vans ; Africa, by the Vandals ; the Burgundians, Goths,
                    Franks, and Alans, had erected ſeveral te-trarchies in Gaul ; at length Italy
                    itſelf, with its proud metropolis, which for ſo many ages had given law to the
                    reſt of the world, was enilaved by a contemptible barbarian, whoſe family,
                    country, and nation, are not well known to this day.</p>
                <p>From this time, Rome has ceaſed to be the capital of an empire ; the territories
                    of the pope, to whom the city is now ſubject, being inconſiderable. The origin
                    of the pope’s temporal power, and the revolutions of Italy,are related under the

                <p>It is thought that the walls of modern Rome take in nearly the ſame extent of
                    ground as the ancient ; but the difference between the number of buildings on
                    this ſpot is very great, one half of modern Rome lying waſte, or occupied with
                    gardens, fields, meadows, and vineyards. One may walk quite round the city in
                    three or ſour hours at moſt, the circumference being reckoned about 13 Italian
                    miles. With regard to the number of the inhabitants, modern Rome is alſo greatly
                    inferior to the ancient : for, in 1709, the whole of theſe amounted only to
                    138,568 ; among which were 40 biſhops, 2686 prieſts, 3559 monks, 1814 nuns, 393
                    courteſans, about 8000 or 9000 Jews, and 14 Moors. In 1714, the number was
                    increaſed to 143,cco. In external ſplendor, and the beauty of its temples and
                    palaces, modern Rome is thought by the moſt judicious travellers to excel the
                    ancient. There was nothing in ancient Rome to be compared with St Peter’s church
                    in the modern. That Rome was able to recover itſelf after ſo many calamities and
                    devaſtations, will not be matter of ſurpriſe, if we conſider the prodigious ſums
                    that it has ſo long annually drawn from all countries of the Popiſh perſuafion.
                    Theſe ſums, though ſtill conſiderable, have been continually decreaſing ſince
                    the Reformation. The ſurface of the ground on which Rome was originally founded
                    is ſurpriſingly altered. At preſent it is difficult to diſtinguiſh the ſeven
                    hills on which it was firſt built, the low grounds being almoſt filled up with
                    the ruins of the ancient ſtreets and houſes, and the great quantities of earth
                    waſhed down from the hills by the violence of the rains. Anciently the ſuburbs
                    extended a vaſt way on all ſides, and made the city appear almoſt boundleſs ;
                    but it is quite otherwiſe now, the country about Rome being almbſt a deſert. To
                    this and other cauſes it is owing, that the air is none of the moſt wholeſome,
                    eſpecially during the ſummer heats, when few go abroad in the day-time. No city
                    at preſent in the world ſurpaſſes, or indeed equals, Rome, ſor the multiplicity
                    of fine fountains, noble edifices, antiquities, curioſities, paintings, ſtatues,
                    and ſculptures. The city ſtands on the Tiber, 10 miles from the Tuſcan ſea, 380
                    from Vienna, 560 from Paris, 740 from Amſterdam, 810 from London, and 900 from
                    Madrid. The Tiber is ſubject to fre-</p>

                <p>quent ’ inundations, by which it often does great damage. A ſmall part of the
                    city is ſeparated ſrom the other by the river, and is therefore called <hi
                        rend="italic"> Traveftere,</hi> or beyond the Tiber. There are ſeveral
                    bridges over the river, a great number of towers on the walls, and 20 gates. The
                    remains of Rome’s ancient grandeur conſiſt of ſtatues, coloffuſes, temples,
                    palaces, theatres, naumachias, triumphal arches, circuſes, columns, obeliſhs,
                    fountains, aqueducts, mauſoleums, thermae or hot-baths, and other ſtructures. Of
                    modern buildings, the ſplendid churches and palaces are the moſt remarkable. Mr
                    Addiſon ſays, it is almoſt impoſſible for a man to form in his imagination ſuch
                    beautiful and glorious ſcenes as are to be met with in ſeveral of the Roman
                    churches and chapels. This gentleman tells us alſo, that no part of the
                    antiquities of Rome pleaſed him ſo much as the ancient ſtatues, of which there
                    is ſtill an incredible variety. Next to the ſtatues, he ſays, there is nothing
                    more lurpriſing than the amazing variety of ancient pillars of ſo many kinds of
                    marble. Rome is ſaid to be well paved ; but not well lighted, nor kept very
                    clean, Two-thirds of the houſes are the property of the churches, convents, and
                    alms houſes. Proteſtants are not obliged to kneel at the elevation of the hoſt,
                    or at meeting the euchariſt in the ſtreets ; and they may have ſteſh-meat always
                    at the inns, even during Lent. Here are many academies for promoting arts and
                    ſciences, beſides the univerſity. The carnival here is only during the eight
                    days before Lent, and there are no ſuch ſcenes of riot as at Venice :
                    proſtitutes, however, are publicly tolerated. To maintain good order, there is a
                    body of 300 Sbirri, or Halberdeers, under their barigella, or colonel. There is
                    little or no trade carried on in Rome, but a vaſt deal of money is ſpent by
                    travellers and other ſtrangers. The principal modern ſtructures are the church
                    of St Peter, and the other churches ; the aqueducts and fountains ; the Vatican,
                    and the other palaces ; the Campidolio, where the Roman ſenate refides,
                    &amp;c. 1 he principal remains of antiquity are the</p>
                <p>pila miliaria of fine marble ; the equeſtrian braſs ſtatue of Marcus Aurelius
                    Antoninus ; the marble monument of the emperor Alexander Severus ; marble buſts
                    of the emperors and their conforts ; three brick arches of the temple of Peace,
                    built by the emperor Veſpaſian ; the triumphal arch of Septimus Severus and of
                    Gallienus ; the circus of Antoninus Caracalla ; ſome parts of the cloaca-maxima
                    ; the columna Antonina, repreſenting the principal actions of Marcus Aurelius ;
                    the columna Trajani, or Trajan’s pillar ; ſome fragments of the curia, or palace
                    of Antoninus Pius, and of Nerva’s forum ; the mauſolseum of Auguſtus, in the
                    Strada Pontifici ; the remains of the emperor Severus’s tomb without St John’s
                    gate ; the pyramid of Caius Ceſtus near St Paul’s gate ; the porphy ry coffin of
                    St Helen, and the original ſtatue of Conſtantine the Great, in the church of St
                    John of Lateran: a font of oriental granite, in the chapel of St Giovanni in
                    fonte, ſajd to have been erected by Conſtantine the Great ; an Egyptian obeliſlc
                    near the church of St Maria Maggiore ; the ſtately remains of Dioclefian’s baths
                    ; the celebrated Pantheon ; the obeliſks of Se-ſoſtris and Auguſtus by the
                    Clementine college ; the church of St Paul fuori della Mura, ſaid to have been
                    built by Conſtantine the Great ; the Farneſe Hercu.</p>
                <p>les, in white marble, of a Coloſſian ſize and exquiſite workmänihip, in a court
                    of the Farneſe palace, and an admirable group cut out of one block of marble, in
                    another court of the ſame palace. Beſides theſe there are a great many more,
                    which our bounds will not allow us to take any further notice of. Here is a
                    great number of rich and well-regulated hoſpitals. Near the church of St
                    Sebaſtiano alle Catacombe, are the moſt ſpacious of the catacombs, where the
                    Chriſtians, who never burned their dead, and ſuch of the Pagan Romans as could
                    not afford the expence of burning, were buried. Along the Via Appia, without St
                    Sehaſtian’s gate, were the tombs of the principal families of Rome, which at
                    preſent are uſed for cellars and ſtore-houſes by the gardeners and
                    vine-dreſſers.
