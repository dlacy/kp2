<p><span class="font1">of the use of a favourite device in later fiction, by which fairies are introduced who bestow special gifts at the birth of a hero ; and&nbsp;amongst its chief personages is the misshapen dwarf Tronc, afterwards named Aubron—that is, Oberon—and made beautiful. He&nbsp;was adopted from the old French story of Huon de Bordeaux, just&nbsp;as the Oberon of the latter had his origin in the Elberich of the&nbsp;Heldenhuch. The original composition of Pereeforest has been&nbsp;assigned without reason to the 13th century, and it is possible that&nbsp;some insignificant portion of the romance may have been written&nbsp;in the 14th ; but the probability is that David Aubert was the real&nbsp;author of the extant work, and that he wrote it at the court of&nbsp;Burgundy about 1450. It would be difficult to imagine a work&nbsp;more absurd, heterogeneous, and wearying in its immensity than&nbsp;this. The very “variety” for which Dunlop praises it merely&nbsp;indicates the mass of multifarious and incongruous incidents, unconnected and uninteresting, of which it is full. Antiquaries, however, find it useful for the history of those knightly sports called&nbsp;tournaments, immense numbers of which are described in minute&nbsp;detail. Arthur of Little Britain must have been considered a very&nbsp;interesting romance when Lord Berners translated it into English,&nbsp;but we cannot discover its attractiveness. It is a dull inartistic&nbsp;composition, with scarcely any distinctiveness in the drawing of&nbsp;its personages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A great number of poetic and prose compositions, beginning with chansons and fabliaux in the 12th and 13th centuries, form&nbsp;a large portion of the literature of Arthurian romance ; but in most&nbsp;instances they deal only with episodes, and are better described in&nbsp;the articles relating to the literature to which they belong than they&nbsp;could be, or ought to be, here. Some of them may, however, be&nbsp;mentioned briefly in chronological succession. In the 12th century&nbsp;—that is, between 1170 and 1200—Arnaud Daniel the troubadour&nbsp;wrote a poem, now quite lost, on Lancelot and Guinevere ; Chrestien&nbsp;de Troyes the trouvère wrote one entitled the Charrette, i.e., in reference to Lancelot’s unknightly mode upon one occasion of hurrying&nbsp;to the rescue of Guinevere in a cart for want of a horse ; this story&nbsp;was continued by Godefroi de Leigni. Chrestien wrote another&nbsp;poem on (Peredur) Perceval, which was continued by three other&nbsp;hands, in which Perceval remains the achiever of the Grail-quest.&nbsp;He also wrote Eree et Enide, a poem which contains the same&nbsp;substance as the Welsh story of Geraint in the Mabinogion, and&nbsp;which never appeared in any of the Arthurian romances ; and the&nbsp;Chevalier au Lyon, which is similarly identical with the Lady of&nbsp;the Fountain in the Mabinogion. Owen or Ywain, the Chevalier&nbsp;au Lyon, is a prominent Round Table knight in the romances,&nbsp;but his story is not incorporated in them. Hartmann von der&nbsp;Aue translated Chrestien’s poem into German verse before 1200 ;&nbsp;in English it appeared as Twain and Gawain in the 14th century ;&nbsp;another English poem, ∕S⅛'r Gawaine and the Green Knight, was&nbsp;written about 1360, as well as a Scottish Golagrus and Gawaine,&nbsp;in the 14th century. A poem, dated 1212, containing Le Roman&nbsp;de Joseph JA∣imathix, has been published by Francisque Michel,&nbsp;and is supposed by many to be Robert de Borron’s original work.&nbsp;Its substance is the same as the first part of the prose Petit Graal,&nbsp;which Hucher has published as Borron’s real original. About the&nbsp;same time, or a few years earlier, Ulrich von Zatzikhoven translated&nbsp;Arnaud Daniel’s Lancelot into German verse ; the lost Perceval in&nbsp;verse of Guyot de Provins and Wolfram von Eschenbach’s metrical&nbsp;German version of it (in which he miscalls the trouvère “ Kiot der&nbsp;Provenzal ”) have already been mentioned. There is an early&nbsp;German poem called Wigalois, composed by Wirnt of Grafenberg&nbsp;(i.c., Gui, son of Gawain), evidently derived soon after 1200 from&nbsp;a French original, Gui Galeis or Giglan, which is lost. On Gawain&nbsp;himself there are two French poems by Raoul and Renault or&nbsp;Raoul de Beaujeu, of the 13th century ; and one of Chrestien de&nbsp;Troyes’s chansons (before 1200) celebrates Cliges, a nephew of&nbsp;Gawain. A French poem on Merlin dates from about 1300.&nbsp;There is a Petit Tristan or Brun de la Montagne, written in verse&nbsp;in the 14th century. The French poems of Marie de France,&nbsp;written in England early in the 13th century, contain lays of&nbsp;Lanνal and of Chevrc-feuille (on Tristan), which are professedly&nbsp;Arthurian subjects. Of the English works on the Round Table&nbsp;romances the chief are the metrical History of the Grail, translated early in the 15th century by Henry Lonelich, and published&nbsp;from a MS. by ’the Roxburghe Club, and Sir Thomas Malory’s&nbsp;Morte Arthur. An English prose romance of Merlin was written&nbsp;about 1450, and a metrical Arthour and Merlin is probably fifty&nbsp;or sixty years older. A further Life of Arthur in English verse&nbsp;is supposed to have been composed about 1428. There is a metrical version of Renault de Beaujeu’s Giglan, probably of the latter&nbsp;part of the 14th century. Two poems both entitled Morte Arthur&nbsp;exist, one written about 1390, which especially treats of King&nbsp;Arthur, and another belonging to the middle of the 15th century,&nbsp;of which the story of Lancelot is the subject-matter ; and there&nbsp;is a Scottish Lancelot of the Laik in verse, which was composed&nbsp;late in that century. A romance of the Seint Graal, in verse,&nbsp;written about 1350, was probably a translation of Robert de Borron’s&nbsp;Joseph d'Arirnathix. Between 1838 and 1849 Lady Charlotte</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Guest printed and translated the Mabinogion (Children’s Stories) from the Welsh MS. known as the Llyfr Coeh o Hergest, transcribed late in the 14th century, and now preserved at Oxford, in&nbsp;the library of Jesus College. At first it was believed that these&nbsp;stories, so far as they agreed with the narratives of the printed&nbsp;French romances, were copies of the original legends used by&nbsp;Walter Map and the Borrons ; but there can be little doubt that&nbsp;only those portions which are not found in the romances are of&nbsp;independent Celtic or Cambrian origin, while the remainder was&nbsp;derived from the French stories or poems of the 13th and 14th&nbsp;centuries.</span></p>
