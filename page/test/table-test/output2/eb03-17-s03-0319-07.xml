 a ſilver coin, in uſe among the ancient Romans, called alſo limply <hi rend="italic">nummus,</hi> and ſometimes nummus <hi rend="italic">ſestertius.</hi> The ſeſtertius was the fourth part of the denarius, and originally contained two aſſes and a half. It was at firſt denoted by LLS ; the two L’s ſignifying two libræ, and the S half. But the librarii, afterwards converting the two L’s into an H, expreſſed the ſeſtertius by HS. The word <hi rend="italic">ſestertius</hi> was firſt introduced by way of abbreviation for <hi rend="italic">ſemijlcrtius,</hi> which ſignifies two, and a half of a third, or, literally, only half a third ; for in expreſſing half a third, it was underſtood that there were two before.</p><p>Some authors make two kinds of ſeſterces ; the leſs called <hi rend="italic">ſeslertius,</hi> in the maſculine gender; and the great one, called <hi rend="italic">ſestertium,</hi> in the neuter : the firſt, that we have already deſcribed ; the latter containing a thouſand of the other. Others will have any ſuch diſtinction of great and little ſeſterces unknown to the Romans : <hi rend="italic">ſestertius,</hi> ſay they, was an adjective, and ſignified <hi rend="italic">as ſester-</hi><pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0326.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0320"/>
<hi rend="italic">tins,</hi> or two asses and a half ; and when uſed in the plural, as in <hi rend="italic">quinquaginta ſestertium,</hi> or s <hi rend="italic">estertia,</hi> it was only by way of abbreviation, and there was always underſtood <hi rend="italic">Centena, millia,</hi> &amp; c.</p><p>This matter has been accurately ſtated by Mr Raper, in the following manner. The ſubſtantive to which ſeſtertius referred is either <hi rend="italic">as,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pendus ;</hi> and sest <hi rend="italic">ertius as</hi> is two aſſes and a half ; <hi rend="italic">ſeſtertium pondus,</hi> two pondera and a half, or two hundred and fifty denarii. When the denarius passed for ten aſſes, the ſeſtertius of two aſſes and a half was a quarter of it ; and the Romans continued to keep their accounts in theſe ſeſterces long after the denarius passed for ſixteen aſſes ; till, growing rich, they found it more convenient to reckon by quarters of the denarius, which they called <hi rend="italic">nummi,</hi> and uſed the words <hi rend="italic">nummus</hi> and s <hi rend="italic">estertius</hi> indifferently, as ſynonymous terms, and ſometimes both together, as <hi rend="italic">ſestertius nummus ;</hi> in which case the word <hi rend="italic">ſeſtertius,</hi> having loſt its original ſigniſication, was uſed as a ſubſtantive ; for <hi rend="italic">ſeſtertius nummus</hi> was not two nummi and a half, but a ſingle nummus of four aſſes. They called any ſum under two thouſand ſeſterces so many <hi rend="italic">ſestertii</hi> in the maſculine gender ; two thouſand ſeſterces they called <hi rend="italic">duo</hi> or b <hi rend="italic">ina sestertia,</hi> in the neuter ; ſo many quarters making five hundred denarii, which was twice the ſeſtertium ; and they ſaid <hi rend="italic">dena, vicena, &amp; c. sestertia,</hi> till the ſum amounted to a thouſand ſeſtertia, which was a million of ſeſterces. But, to avoid ambiguity, they did not uſe the neuter <hi rend="italic">ſestertium</hi> in the singular number, when the whole ſum amounted to no more than a thouſand ſeſterces, or one ſeſtertium. They called a million of ſeſterces <hi rend="italic">decies nummum,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">decies sestertium,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">decies centena millia nummorum,</hi> or sestertiorum (the maſculine gender), omitting <hi rend="italic">centena millia</hi> for the ſake of brevity. They like- wiſe called the ſame ſum <hi rend="italic">decies sestertium</hi> (in the neuter gender) for <hi rend="italic">decies centies sestertium,</hi> omitting <hi rend="italic">centies</hi> for the ſame reaſon; or ſimply <hi rend="italic">decies,</hi> omitting <hi rend="italic">centena millia sestertium,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">centies sestertium ;</hi> and with the numeral adverbs <hi rend="italic">decies, vicies, centies, millies,</hi> and the like, either <hi rend="italic">centena millia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">centies</hi> was always underſtood. Theſe were their most uſual forms of expreſſion ; though for b <hi rend="italic">na, dena, vicena J'eβertia,</hi> they frequently ſaid <hi rend="italic">bina, dena, vicena millia nummum.</hi> If the conſular denarius contained 6o troy grains of fine silver, it was worth ſomewhat more than eight-pence farthing and a half ſterling ; and the as, of 16 to the denarius, a little more than a halfpenny. To reduce the ancient ſeſterces of two aſſes and a half, when the denarius passed for 16, to pounds ſterling, multiply the given number by 5454, and cut off six figures on the right hand for decimals. To reduce <hi rend="italic">nummi sestertii,</hi> or quarters of the denarius, to pounds ſterling ; if the given ſum be conſular money, multiply it by 8727, and cut off six figures on the right hand for decimals; but for imperial money diminiſh the ſaid product by one-eighth of itſelf.
