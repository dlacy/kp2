<p><span class="font0">and although we may ſay that the general ſlope is ne-ceiſarily ſecured by the cills of the flood-gates, which are paved with ſtone or covered with planks, yet this&nbsp;will not hinder this increaſed current from digging up&nbsp;the bottom in the intervals, undermining the banks,&nbsp;and lodging the mud and earth thus carried off in&nbsp;places where the current meets with any check. All&nbsp;theſe conſequences will aſſuredly follow il the increaſed&nbsp;velocity is greater than what correſponds to the regimen relative to the ſoil in which the river holds on its&nbsp;courſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In order therefore to procure durability to works oſ this kind, which are generally of enormous expence,&nbsp;the local circumſtances muſt be moſt ſcrupulouſly ſtu-died. It is not the ordinary hurried ſurvey of an engineer that will free us from the riſk of our navigation&nbsp;becoming very troubleſome by the riſe of the waters&nbsp;being diminiſhed from their former quantity, and banks&nbsp;formed at a ſmall diſtance below every ſluice. We muſt&nbsp;attentively ſtudy the nature of the ſoil, and diſcover experimentally the velocity which is not inconſiſtent with&nbsp;the permanency of the channel. If this be not a great&nbsp;deal leſs than that of the river when accelerated by&nbsp;freſhes, the regimen may be preſerved after the eſta-bliſhment of the gate, and no great changes in the&nbsp;channel will be neceſſary : but if, on the other hand, the&nbsp;natural velocity of the river during its freſhes greatly&nbsp;exceeds what is conſiſtent with ſtability, we muſt enlarge the width of the channel, that we may diminiſh&nbsp;the hydraulic mean depth, and along with this the velocity. Therefore, knowing the quantity diſeharged during the freſhes, divide it by the velocity of regimen, or&nbsp;rather by a velocity ſomewhat greater (for a reaſon&nbsp;which will appear by and by), the quotient will be the&nbsp;area of a new ſection. Then taking the natural ſlope&nbsp;of the river for the ſlope which it will preſerve in this&nbsp;enlarged channel, and after the cills of the flood-gates&nbsp;have been fixed, we muſt calculate the hydraulic mean&nbsp;depth, and then the other dimenſions of the channel.&nbsp;And, laſtly, from the known dimenſions of the channel&nbsp;and the diſeharge (which we muſt now compute), we&nbsp;proceed to calculate the height and the diſtances of the&nbsp;flood-gates, adjuſted to their widths, which muſt be regulated by the room which may be thought proper for&nbsp;the free paſſage of the lighters which are to ply on the&nbsp;river. An example will illuſtrate the whole of this&nbsp;proceſs.</span></p>
    <p><span class="font0">Suppoſe then a ſmall river having a ſlope of 2 inches in 100 fathoms or </span><span class="font1"><sub>τ7</sub><sup>,</sup><sub>5</sub>-<sub>δ</sub>j </span><span class="font0">which is a very uſual declivity&nbsp;of ſuch ſmall ſtreams, and whoſe depth in lummer is 2&nbsp;feet, but ſubject to floods which raiſe it to nine feet.&nbsp;Let its breadth at the bottom be 18 feet, and the baſe&nbsp;qf its ſlanting ſides 4 of their height. All of theſe dimenſions are very conformable to the ordinary courſe of&nbsp;things. It is propoſed to make this river navigable in&nbsp;all ſeaſons by means of keeps and gates placed at proper diſtances ; and we want to know the dimenſions of&nbsp;a<sub>j</sub> channel which will be permanent, in a ſoil which&nbsp;begins to yield to a velocity of 80 inches per ſecond,&nbsp;but will be ſafe under a velocity of 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The primitive channel having the properties of a rectangular channel, its breadth during the freſhes muſt be B = 30 ſeet, or 360 inches, and its depth </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0"> 9 feet&nbsp;or 1c8 inches ; therefore its hydraulic mean depth</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font0">fore, during the freſhes, will be 38,9447 inches, and its diſcharge 15j4169 cubic inches, or 876⅛∙ cubic feet&nbsp;per ſecond. We ſee therefore that the natural channel&nbsp;will not be permanent, and will be very quickly deſtroyed or changed by this great velocity. We have two&nbsp;methods for procuring ſtability, viz. diminiſhing the&nbsp;ſlope, or widening the bed. The firſt method will require the courſe to be lengthened in the proportion of&nbsp;24’ to 3988<sup>i</sup>, or nearly of 36 to 100. —The expence&nbsp;of this would be enormous. The ſecond method will&nbsp;require the hydraulic mean depth to be increaſed nearly in the ſame proportion (becauſe the velocities are</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ly, and, even to procure convenient room for the navigation, muſt be preferred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We muſt now obſerve, that the great velocity, of which we are afraid, obtains only during the winter&nbsp;floods. If therefore we reduce this to 24 inches, it&nbsp;muſt happen that the autumnal freſhes, loaded with&nbsp;fand and mud, will certainly depoſit a part of it, and&nbsp;choak up bur channel below the flood-gates. We muſt&nbsp;therefore ſelect a mean velocity ſomewhat exceeding&nbsp;the regimen, that it may carry off theſe depoſitions.&nbsp;We ſhall take 27 inches, which will produce this effect&nbsp;on the looſe mud without endangering our channel in&nbsp;any remarkable degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Therefore we have, by the theorem for uniform mo.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">5,3843, and therefore </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0"> = 30⅛. Having thus determined the hydraulic mean depth, we find the area 8 of the ſection by dividing the diſcharge 1514169 by the&nbsp;velocity 27. This gives us 56080,368. Then we&nbsp;get the breadth B by the formula formerly given,</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">With theſe dimenſions of the ſection we are certain that the channel will be permanent ; and the cills of&nbsp;the flood-gates being all fixed agreeable to the primitive&nbsp;ſlope, we need not fear that it will be changed in the&nbsp;intervals by the action of the current. The gates being all open during the freſhes, the bottom will be&nbsp;cleared of all depoſited mud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We muſt now ſtation the flood-gates along the new channel, at ſuch diſtances that we may have the depth&nbsp;of water which is proper for the lighters that are to be&nbsp;employed in the navigation. Suppoſe this to be four&nbsp;feet. We muſt firſt of all learn how high the water&nbsp;will be kept in this new channel during the ſummer&nbsp;droughts.
