<p><span class="font1">In the 3d and 4th centuries Roman rings were made engraved with Christian symbols. Fig. 1 shows two silver&nbsp;rings of the latter part of the 4th century,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">which were found in 1881 concealed in a</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">hole in the pavement of a Roman villa at</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fifehead Neville, Dorset, together with</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">some coins of the same period. Both</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">have the monogram of Christ, and one</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">has a dove within an olive wreath rudely</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">cut on the silver bezel. These rings are</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of special interest, as Roman objects with</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">any Christian device have very rarely</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">been found in Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Large numbers of gold rings have been found in many parts of Europe in the tombs of early Celtic races. They are&nbsp;usually of very pure gold, often penannular in form—with&nbsp;a slight break, that is, in the hoop so as to form a spring.&nbsp;They are often of gold wire formed into a sort of rope, or&nbsp;else a simple bar twisted in an ornamental way. Some of&nbsp;the quite plain penannular rings were used in the place&nbsp;of coined money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Throughout the Middle Ages the signet ring was a thing of great importance in religious, legal, commercial,&nbsp;and private matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The episcopal ring</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> was solemnly conferred upon the newly made bishop together with his crozier, a special&nbsp;formula for this being inserted in the Pontifical. In the&nbsp;time of Innocent III. (1194) this was ordered to be of&nbsp;pure gold mounted with a stone that was not engraved ; but&nbsp;this rule appears not to have been strictly kept. Owing&nbsp;to the custom of burying the episcopal ring in its owner’s&nbsp;coffin a great many fine examples still exist. Among the&nbsp;splendid collection of rings formed by the distinguished&nbsp;naturalist Edmund Waterton, and now in the South&nbsp;Kensington Museum, is a fine gold episcopal ring decorated&nbsp;with niello, and inscribed with the name of Alhstan, bishop&nbsp;of Sherborne from 824 to 867 (see fig. 2).</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> In many cases&nbsp;an antique gem was mounted in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">bishop’s ring, and often an inscrip</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">tion was added in the gold setting</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of the gem to give a Christian</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">name to the pagan figure. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">monks of Durham, for example,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">made an intaglio of Jupiter Serapis</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">into a portrait of St Oswald by</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">adding the legend capvt s. oswaldi. In other cases the engraved gem appears to have been merely regarded as an&nbsp;ornament without meaning, as, for example, a magnificent&nbsp;gold ring found in the coffin of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Seflrid, bishop of Chichester (1125-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1151), in which is mounted a Gnos</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">tic intaglio. Another in the Water-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ton collection bears a Roman cameo</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">in plasma of a female head in high</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">relief ; the gold ring itself is of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">12th century. More commonly the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">episcopal ring was set with a large</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">sapphire, ruby, or other stone cut</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">en cabochon,</span><span class="font1"> that is, without facets,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">and very magnificent in effect (see</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">fig. 3). It was worn over the bishop’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">gloves, usually on the fore-finger of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the right hand ; and this accounts for the large size of the hoop of these rings. In the 15th and 16th centuries&nbsp;bishops often wore three or four rings on the right hand</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">in addition to a large jewel which was fixed to the back of each glove.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Cramp rings were much worn during the Middle Ages as a preservative against cramp. They derived their&nbsp;virtue from being blessed by the king ; a special form of&nbsp;service was used for this, and a large number of rings were&nbsp;consecrated at one time, usually when the sovereign&nbsp;touched patients for the king’s evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Decade rings were not uncommon, especially in the 15th century ; these were so called from their having ten&nbsp;knobs along the hoop of the ring, and were used, after&nbsp;the manner of rosaries, to say nine aves and a paternoster.&nbsp;In some cases there are only nine knobs, the bezel of the&nbsp;ring being counted in, and taking the place of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">g nude&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">in a rosary. The bezel of these rings is usually engraved&nbsp;with a sacred monogram or word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Gemel or gimmel rings, from the Latin </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gemellus,</span><span class="font1"> a twin, were made with two hoops fitted together, and could be&nbsp;worn either together or singly ; they were common in the&nbsp;16th and 17th centuries, and were much used as betrothal&nbsp;rings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Posy rings,</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> so called from the “ poesy ” or rhyme engraved on them, were specially common in the same centuries. The name posy ring does not occur earlier than the 16th century. A posy ring inscribed with “ love me&nbsp;and leave me not ” is mentioned by Shakespeare (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mer</span><span class="font1">. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of&nbsp;Ven.,</span><span class="font1"> act v. sc. 1). The custom of inscribing rings with&nbsp;mottoes or words of good omen dates from a very early&nbsp;time. Greek and Roman rings exist with words such as&nbsp;ZHCAIC, XAIPE, KAAH, or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">vobis meis Claudia vivas.</span><span class="font1"> In the&nbsp;Middle Ages many rings were inscribed with words of cabalistic power, such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">anam zapta,</span><span class="font1"> or Caspar, Melchior, and&nbsp;Balthasar, the supposed names of the Magi. In the 17th&nbsp;century they were largely used as wedding rings, with such&nbsp;phrases as “love and obaye,” “fear God and love me,”&nbsp;or “mulier viro subjecta esto.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the same century memorial rings with a name and date of death were frequently made of very elaborate&nbsp;form, enamelled in black and white ; a not unusual design&nbsp;was two skeletons bent along the hoop, and holding a&nbsp;coffin which formed the bezel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the 15th and 16th centuries signet rings engraved with a badge or trademark were much used by merchants&nbsp;and others ; these were not only used to form seals, but&nbsp;the ring itself was often sent by a trusty bearer as the&nbsp;proof of the genuineness of a bill of demand.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> At the same&nbsp;time private gentlemen used massive rings wholly of gold&nbsp;with their initials cut on the bezel, and a graceful knot&nbsp;of flowers twining round the letters. Of this kind is&nbsp;Shakespeare’s ring, now in the British Museum, which was&nbsp;found near the church of Stratford ; on it is cut a cord&nbsp;arranged in loops between the letters W and S. Other&nbsp;fine gold rings of this period have coats of arms or crests&nbsp;with graceful lambrequins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Poison rings with a hollow bezel were used in classical times; as, for example, that by which Hannibal killed&nbsp;himself, and the poison ring of Demosthenes. Pliny&nbsp;records that, after Crassus had stolen the gold treasure&nbsp;from under the throne of Capitoline Jupiter, the guardian&nbsp;of the shrine, to escape torture, “ broke the gem of his ring&nbsp;in his mouth and died immediately.” The mediæval&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">anello della morte,</span><span class="font1"> supposed to be a Venetian invention,&nbsp;was actually used as an easy method of murder. Among&nbsp;the elaborate ornaments of the bezel a hollow point made&nbsp;to work with a spring was concealed ; it communicated&nbsp;with a receptacle for poison in a cavity behind, in such a</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
