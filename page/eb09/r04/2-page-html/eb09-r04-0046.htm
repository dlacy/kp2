<p><span class="font1">the florid Byzantine style. He is very fond of allegorical representations; thus, in his sermon on Holy Week,&nbsp;Christianity is represented under the form of spring,&nbsp;Paganism and Judaism under that of winter, and evil&nbsp;thoughts are spoken of as boisterous winds. An attempt&nbsp;to carry this symbolism through other portions of his&nbsp;writings leads him to many fantastic conceits which are&nbsp;far from being in good taste. And here may be mentioned&nbsp;the many lives of the saints and the Fathers to be found in&nbsp;early Russian literature. Some of these have been edited&nbsp;by Count Bezborodko in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pametniki Starinnoi Russkoi&nbsp;Literaturi</span><span class="font1"> (“Memorials of Ancient Russian Literature”).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We now come to the story of the expedition of Prince Igor, which is a kind of bilina in prose, and narrates the&nbsp;expedition of Igor, prince of Novgorod-Severski, against&nbsp;the Polovtzes. The manuscript was at one time preserved&nbsp;in a monastery at Yaroslavl, but was burnt in the great&nbsp;fire at Moscow in the year 1812. Luckily the story had&nbsp;been edited (after a fashion) by Count Musin-Pushkin,&nbsp;and a transcript was also found among the papers of the&nbsp;empress Catherine. The authenticity of this production&nbsp;has been disputed by some modern scholars, but without&nbsp;solid grounds. The original was seen by several men of&nbsp;letters in Russia, Karamzin among the number. There is&nbsp;a mixture of Christian and heathen allusions, but there are&nbsp;parallels to this style of writing in such a piece as the&nbsp;“ Discourse of a Lover of Christ and Advocate of the True&nbsp;Faith,” from which an extract has been given by Buslaeff&nbsp;in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chrestomathy.</span><span class="font1"> Unlike most of the productions of&nbsp;this period, which are tedious, and interesting only to the&nbsp;philologist and antiquary, there is a great deal of poetical&nbsp;spirit in the story of Igor, and the metaphors are frequently very vigorous. Mention is made in it of another&nbsp;bard named Boyan, but none of his inspirations have come&nbsp;down to us. A strange legend is that of the czar Solomon&nbsp;and Kitovras, but the story occurs in the popular literatures&nbsp;of many countries. Some similar productions among the&nbsp;Russians are merely adaptations of old Bulgarian tales,&nbsp;especially the so-called apocryphal writings. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Zadon-stchina</span><span class="font1"> is a sort of prose-poem much in the style of the&nbsp;“ Story of Igor,” and the resemblance of the latter to this&nbsp;piece and to many other of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">skαzαniα</span><span class="font1"> included in or&nbsp;attached to the Russian chronicle, furnishes an additional&nbsp;proof of its genuineness. The account of the battle of the&nbsp;“Field of Woodcocks,” which was gained by Dmitri&nbsp;Donskoi over the Mongols in 1380, has come down in three&nbsp;important versions. The first bears the title “ Story of&nbsp;the Fight of the Prince Dmitri Ivanovich with Marnai”; it&nbsp;is rather meagre in details but full of expressions showing&nbsp;the patriotism of the writer. The second version is more&nbsp;complete in its historical details, but still is not without&nbsp;anachronisms. The third is altogether poetical. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Povixst ο Drakule</span><span class="font1"> (“Story of Drakula”) is a collection of&nbsp;anecdotes relating to a cruel prince of Moldavia, who lived&nbsp;at the beginning of the 15th century. Several of the barbarities described in it have also been assigned to Ivan the&nbsp;Terrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The early Russian laws present many features of interest, such as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ruxskaia Pravda</span><span class="font1"> of Yaroslaff, which&nbsp;is preserved in the chronicle of Novgorod ; the date is&nbsp;between 1018 and 1054. Large additions were made to&nbsp;it by subsequent princes. It has many points in common&nbsp;with the Scandinavian codes, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font1"> trial by wager of battle,&nbsp;the wergild, and the circuits of the judges. The laws&nbsp;show Russia at that time to have been in civilization&nbsp;quite on a level with the rest of Europe. But the evil&nbsp;influence of the Mongols was soon to make itself felt.&nbsp;The next important code is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sudebnik</span><span class="font1"> of Ivan III.,&nbsp;the date of which is 1497 ; this was followed by that of&nbsp;Ivan IV., of the year 1550, in which we have a republication by the czar of his grandfather’s laws, with additions.&nbsp;In the time of this emperor also was issued the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Stoglav&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1551), a body of ecclesiastical regulations. Mention must&nbsp;also be made of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ulozhxnix</span><span class="font1"> or “ Ordinance” of the czar&nbsp;Alexis. This abounds with enactments of sanguinary&nbsp;punishment : women are buried alive for murdering their&nbsp;husbands ; torture is recognized as a means of procuring&nbsp;evidence ; and the knout and mutilation are mentioned on&nbsp;almost every page. Some of the penalties are whimsical :&nbsp;for instance, the man who uses tobacco is to have his nose&nbsp;cut off ; this, however, was to be altered by Peter the Great,&nbsp;who himself practised the habit and encouraged it in&nbsp;others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1553 a printing press was established at Moscow, and in 1564 the first book was printed, an “ Apostol,” as&nbsp;it is called, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ix.,</span><span class="font1"> a book containing the Acts of the Apostles&nbsp;and the Epistles. The printers were Ivan Feodoroff and&nbsp;Peter Mstislavetz ; a monument was erected a year or two&nbsp;ago to the memory of the former. As early as 1548 Ivan&nbsp;had invited printers to Russia, but they were detained on&nbsp;their journey. Feodoroff and his companions were soon,&nbsp;however, compelled to leave Russia, and found a protector&nbsp;in Sigismund III. The cause of their failure appears to&nbsp;have been the enmity which they had stirred up among&nbsp;the copyists of books, who felt that their means of gaining&nbsp;a livelihood were lessened. They succeeded accordingly&nbsp;in drawing over to their side the more fanatical priests,&nbsp;who thought it degrading that the sacred books should be&nbsp;multiplied by such an art, just as at the present day the&nbsp;Arabs refuse to allow the Koran to be printed. The first&nbsp;Slavonic Bible was printed at Ostrog in Volhynia in 1581.&nbsp;Another press, however, was soon established at Moscow ;&nbsp;up to 1600 sixteen books had been issued there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A curious work of the time of Ivan the Terrible is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Domostroi,</span><span class="font1"> or “ Book of Household Management,” which is&nbsp;said to have been written by the monk Sylvester, although&nbsp;this statement has been disputed. This priest was at one&nbsp;time very influential with Ivan, but ultimately offended&nbsp;him and was banished to the Solovetzkoi monastery on&nbsp;the White Sea. The work was originally intended by&nbsp;Sylvester for his son Anthemius and his daughter-in-law&nbsp;Pelagia, but it soon became very popular and in general&nbsp;use. We have a faithful picture of the Russia of the&nbsp;time, with all its barbarisms and ignorance. We see the&nbsp;unbounded authority of the husband in his own household: he may inflict personal chastisement upon his wife;&nbsp;and her chief duty lies in ministering to his wants. The&nbsp;Mongols had introduced into Russia the Oriental seclusion&nbsp;of women ; those of the older time knew nothing of these&nbsp;restrictions. Sylvester, or whoever wrote the book, was a&nbsp;complete conservative, as indeed the clergy of Russia&nbsp;almost universally were. @@<sup>1</sup> To the reign of Ivan the Terrible must also be assigned the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chetii-Minei</span><span class="font1"> or “ Book&nbsp;of Monthly Readings,” containing extracts from the Greek&nbsp;fathers, arranged for every day of the week. The work&nbsp;was compiled by the metropolitan Macarius, and was&nbsp;the labour of twelve years. An important writer of&nbsp;the same period was Prince Alexander Kurbski, descended from the sovereigns of Yaroslavl, who was born&nbsp;about 1528. In his early days Kurbski saw a great&nbsp;deal of service, having fought at Kazan and in Livonia,&nbsp;But he quarrelled with Ivan, who had begun to persecute the followers of Sylvester and Adasheff, and fled&nbsp;to Lithuania in 1563, where he was well received by</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> In a curious letter of the date of 1698, and now among the manuscripts of the Bodleian, Bishop Burnet writes thus of a priest who accompanied Peter the Great to England : “The czar’s priest is come&nbsp;over, who is a truly holy man, and more learned than I should have&nbsp;imagined, but thinks it a great piece of religion to be no wiser than&nbsp;his fathers, and therefore cannot bear the thought of imagining that&nbsp;anything among them can want amendment. ”</span></p>
