a ſea port town of Dalmatia, ſeated on the eaſtern banks of the river Cherca, with a biſhop’s ſee. It has been taken and retaken ſeveral times by the Turks and Venetians; and theſe laſt ruined the fortifications and its principal buildings in 1537; but they have been ſince put in a ſtate of defence</p><p>“<note anchored="false" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"></hi> Travels into Dalmatia.</p></note> No veſtiges (ſays Fortis) now remain viſible of that ancient city, where the ſtates of Liburnia held their aſſembly in the times of the Romans. I however tranſcribed theſe two beautiful inſcriptions, which were diſcovered ſome years ago, and are preſerved in the houſe of the reverend Canon Mercati. It is to be hoped, that, as the population of Scardona continues increaſing, new lands will be broken up, and conſequently more frequent diſcoveries made of the precious monuments of antiquity. And it is to be wiſhed, that the few men of letters, who have a ſhare in the regulation of this reviving city, may beſtow ſome particular attention on that article, ſo that the honourable memorials of their ancient and illuſtrious country, which once held ſo eminent a rank among the Liburnian cities, may not be loſt, nor carried away. It is almoſt a ſhame, that only fix legible inſcriptions actually exiſt at Scardona; and that all the others, ſince many more certainly muſt have been dug up there, are either miſerably broken or loſt, or tranſported to Italy, where they loſe the greateſt part of their merit. Roman coins are very frequently found about Scardona, and ſeveral valuable ones were ſhown to me by that hoſpitable prelate Monſignor Treviſani, biſhop and father of the riſing ſettlement One of the principal gentlemen ot the place was ſo kind as to</p><p>give me ſeveral ſepulchral lamps, which are marked by the name of <hi rend="italic">Fortis,</hi> and by the elegant form of the letters appear to be of the beſt times. The repeated devaſtations to which Scardona has been expoſed, have left it no traces of grandeur. It is now, however, beginning to riſe again, and many merchants of Servia and Boſnia have fettled there, on account of the convenient ſituation for trade with the upper provinces of Turkey. But the city has no fortifications, notwith- ſtanding the aſſertion of P. Farlati to the contrary. ” E. Long. 17. 25. N. Lat. 43. 55.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
