            <p>conſtable, appointed by the delivery of a rod at the annual convention.</p>
            <p>SHEARBILL, the <hi rend="italic">Rhynchops Nigra</hi> of Linnæus, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Black Skimmer</hi> of Pennant and Latham, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cut- water</hi> of Cateſhy. Its bill is much compreſſed ; the edges are ſharp ;
                the lower mandible is four inches and a half long ; the upper only three ; the baſe
                red ; the rest is black : the forehead, chin, front of the neck, the breaſt, and
                belly, are white: the head and whole upper part of the body are black : the wings
                are of the same colour : the lower part of the inner webs of the primaries is white
                : the tail is ſhort, and a little forked ; the middle feathers are duſky ; the
                others are white on their ſides : the legs are weak and red : the length is one foot
                eight inches : the extent is three feet ſeven inches. It inhabits America from New
                York to Guiana. It ſkims nimbly along the water, with its under mandible just
                beneath the ſurface, feeding on the infects and ſmall fiſh as it proceeds. It
                frequents alſo oyſter- banks ; its bill being partly like that of the oyſter-
                catcher, adapted for preying on thoſe ſhell-fish.</p>
            <p>SHEATHING, in the ſea-language, is the caſing that part of a ſhip which is to be
                under water with fir- board of an inch thick ; firſt laying hair and tar mixed
                together under the boards, and then nailing them on, in order to prevent worms from
                eating the ſhip’s bottom.—Ships of war are now generally ſheathed with copper : but
                copper ſheathing is liable to be corroded by the action of ſalt water, and ſomething
                is ſtill wanting to effect this purpoſe. It is very probable that tar might anſwer
                very well.</p>
            <p>In the Corniſh mines, copper or braſs pumps are often placed in the deepeſt parts,
                and are conſequentlyexpoſed to the vitriolic or other mineral waters with which ſome
                of theſe mines abound, and which are known to have a much ſtronger effect on copper
                than ſea-water. Theſe pumps are generally about six feet long, and are ſcrewed
                together, and made tight by the interpoſition of a ring of lead, and the joinings
                are afterwards tarred. One of theſe pumps was ſo much corroded as to render it unfit
                for uſe ; but the ſpots of tar, which by accident had dropped on it, preſerved the
                parts they covered from the action of the water. Theſe projected in ſome places more
                than a quarter of an inch ; and the joints were ſo far defended by the thin coat of
                tar, that it was as perfect as when it came from the hands of the manufacturer. If
                tar thus effectually defends copper from theſe acrimonious waters, can there remain
                a doubt of its preſerving it from the much milder waters of the ſea ?</p>
            <p>SHEATS, in a ſhip, are ropes bent to the clews of the sails ; ſerving in the lower
                sails to haul aft the clews of the ſail ; but in topſails they ſerve to haul home
                the clew of the ſail cloſe to the yard-arm.</p>
            <p>SHEEP, in zoology. See OvIs and <hi rend="smallcaps">Wool.</hi></p>
            <p>Amongſt the various animals with which Divine Providence has ſtored the world for the
                uſe of man, none is to b e found more innocent, more uſeful, or more valu</p>
            <p>able, than the ſheep. The ſheep ſupplies us with food and clothing, and finds ample
                employment for our poor at all times and ſeaſons of the year, whereby a variety of
                manufactures of woollen cloth is carried on without interruption to domeſtic comfort
                and loſs to friendly ſociety or injury to health, as is the caſe with many other
                occupations. Every lock of wool that grows on its back becomes the means of ſupport
                to ſtaplers, dyers, pickers, ſcourers, ſcriblers, carders, combers, ſpinners,
                ſpoolers, warpers, queelers, weavers, fullers, tuckers, burlers, ſhearmen, preſſers,
                clothiers, and packers, who, one after another, tumble and toſs, and twiſt, and
                bake, and boil, this raw material, till they have each extracted a livelihood out of
                it ; and then comes the merchant, who, in his turn, ſhips it (in its higheſt ſtate
                of improvement) to all quarters of the globe, from whence he brings back every kind
                of riches to his country, in return for this valuable commodity which the ſheep
                affords.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, the uſeful animal, after being deprived of his coat, produces another
                againſt the next year ; and when we are hungry, and kill him for food, he gives us
                his ſkin to employ the fell-mongers and parchment-makers, who ſupply us with a
                durable material for ſecuring our eſtates, rights, and poſſeſſions ; and if our
                enemies take the field againſt us, ſupplies us with a powerful inſtrument for
                rouſing our courage to repel their attacks. When the parchment-maker has taken as
                much of the ſkin as he can uſe, the glue-maker comes after and picks up every morſel
                that is left, and therewith ſupplies a material for the carpenter and cabinet-maker,
                which they cannot do without, and which is eſſentially neceſſary before we can have
                elegant furniture in our houſes ; tables, chairs, looking-glaſſes, and a hundred
                other articles of convenience : and when the winter nights come on, while we are
                deprived of the cheering light of the ſun, the ſheep ſupplies us with an artificial
                mode of light, whereby we preſerve every pleaſure of domeſtic ſociety, and with
                whose aſſiſtance we can continue our work, or write or read, and improve our minds,
                or enjoy the facial mirth of our tables. Another part of the ſlaughtered animal
                ſupplies us with an ingredient necessary for making good common ſoap, a useful ſtore
                for producing cleanlineſs in every family, rich or poor. Neither need the horns be
                thrown away ; for they are converted by the button-makers and turners into a cheap
                kind of buttons, tips for bows, and many uſeful ornaments. From the very trotters an
                oil is extracted uſeful for many purpoſes, and they afford good food when baked in
                an oven.</p>
            <p>Even the bones are uſeful alſo ; for by a late invention of Dr Higgins, they are
                found, when reduced to aſhes, to be an uſeful and eſſential ingredient in the
                compoſition of the fineſt artificial ſtone in ornamental work for chimney-pieces,
                cornices of rooms, houſes, &amp;c. which renders the composition more durable by
                effectually preventing its cracking @@<hi rend="smallcaps">(a).</hi></p>
            <p>If it is objected to the meek inoffenſive creature, that</p>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">@@@(a)</hi> Any curious perſon would be much entertained to ſee
                the manufactory of bone-aſh, new carried on by Mr Miniſh of White chapel, New Road,
                wherein the bones of ſheep and cows undergo many ingenious proceſſes. 1. There is a
                mill to break them ; 2. A cauldron to extract their oil, marrow, and fat ; 3. A
                reverberatory to heat them red-hot ; 4. An oven for thoſe bones to moulder to aſhes;
                5. A ſtill to collect the fumes of the burnt<pb n="117"> </pb> bones into a brown
                fluid, from whence hartſhorn is made ; 6. Furnaces for making parts thereof into
                Glauber's ſalts ; 7. A sand heat containing twelve jars, for collecting; a
                cryſtallizing vapour into ſal-ammoniac.</p>
