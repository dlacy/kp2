If he uſes no ſuch action, the legs and lower part of the body will gradually ſink till he comes into an upright poſition ; in which he will continue ſuſpended, the hollow of the breaſt keeping the head uppermoſt.</p><p>“ 5thly, But if in this erect poſition the head is kept upright above the ſhoulders, as when we ſtand on the ground, the immerſion will, by the weight of that part of the head that is out of the water, reach above the mouth and noſtrils, perhaps a little above the eyes ; ſo that a man cannot long remain ſuſpended in water with his head in that poſition.</p><p>“ 6thly, The body continued ſuſpended as before, and upright, if the head be leaned quite back, ſo that the face looks upwards, all the back part of the head being then under water, and its weight conſequently in a great meaſure ſupported by it, the face will remain above water quite free for breathing, will riſe an inch higher every inſpiration, and ſink as much every expiration, but never ſo low as that the water may come over the mouth.</p><p>“ 7thly, If therefore a perſon unacquainted with ſwimming, and falling accidentally into the water, could have pretence of mind sufficient to avoid ſtruggling and plunging, and to let the body take this natural poſition, he might continue long ſafe from drowning, till perhaps help would come ; for as to the clothes, their additional weight while immerſed is very inconſiderable, the water ſupporting it ; though when he comes out of the water, he would find them very heavy indeed.”</p><p>The method of learning to ſwim is as follows : The perſon muſt walk into water ſo deep that it will reach to the breaſt. He is then to lie down gently on the belly, keeping the head and neck perfectly upright, the breaſt advancing forward, the thorax inflated, and the back bent then withdrawing the legs from the bottom, and ſtretching them out, ſtrike the arms forwards in uniſon with the legs. Swimming on the back is ſomewhat ſimilar to that on the belly ; but with this difference, that although the legs ∙are employed to move the, body forwards, the arms are generally unemployed, and the progreſſive motion is derived from the movement of the legs. In diving, a perſon muſt dole his hands together, and, preſſing his chin upon his breaſt, make an exertion to bend with force forwards. While in that poſition, he muſt continue to move with rapidity under the ſurface ; and whenever he chooſes to return to his former ſituation, he has nothing to do but bend back his head, and he will immediately return to the ſurface.</p><p>It is very common for novices in the art of ſwimming to make uſe of corks or bladders to aſſiſt in keeping the body above water. Some have utterly condemned the uſe of theſe ; however, Dr Franklin allows that they may be of ſervice for ſupporting the body while one is learning what is called the st<hi rend="italic">roke,</hi> or that manner of drawing in and ſtriking out the hands and feet that is necessary to produce progreſſive motion. “ But (ſays he) you will be no ſwimmer till you can place confidence in the power of the water to ſupport you : I would therefore adviſe the acquiring that confidence in the first place, eſpecially as I have known ſeveral who, by a little of the practice necessary for that purpoſe, have inſenſibly acquired the ſtroke, taught as it were by nature.</p><p>The practice I mean is this : Chooſing a place where the water deepens gradually, walk coolly into it till it is up to your breaſt ; then turn round your face to the ſhore, and throw an egg into; the water, between you and the ſhore ; it will ſink to the bottom, and be eaſily ſeen there, if the water is clear. It muſt lie in the water ſo deep as that you cannot reach it to take it up but by diving for it. To encourage yourſelf in order to do this, reflect that your progreſs will be from deeper to ſhallower water ; and that at any time you may, by bringing your legs under you, and ſtanding on the bottom, raiſe your head far above the waters then plunge under it with your eyes open, throwing yourſelf towards the egg, and endeavouring, by the action of your hands and feet againſt the water, to get forward till within reach of it. In this attempt you will find that the water buoys you up againſt your inclination ; that it is not ſo easy a thing to ſink as you imagined ; that you cannot but by active force get down to the egg. Thus you feel the power of the water to ſupport you, and learn to confide in that power ; while your endeavours to overcome it, and to reach the egg, teach you the manner of acting on the water with your feet and hands ; which action is afterwards uſed in ſwimming to ſupport your head higher above water, or to go forward through it.”</p><p>As ſwimming is a healthy exerciſe and a pleaſant amuſement, and as a dexterity in it may frequently put it in a man’s power to ſave his own life and the lives of his fellow creatures, perhaps of his deareſt friends, it can neither be uſeleſs nor unintereſting to conſider a few of the evolutions which a ſwimmer muſt be maſter of, that he move in any direction without difficulty, without danger, and without being unneceſſarily fatigued.</p><p>There are ſeveral different ways of turning one’s ſelf in ſwimming. You may do it in this way: Turn the palm of the right hand outwards, extend the arm in the ſame manner, and make a contrary movement with the left hand and left arm ; then, by a gradual motion, incline your head and whole body to the left ſide, and the evolution will be finiſhed. There is another way which is eaſier ſtill : Bend your head and body toward that ſide to which you are going to turn. If you wiſh to turn to the left, incline the thumb and the right hand toward the bottom, bend the fingers of the right hand, ſtretch it out, and uſe it for driving away the water ſidewiſe, or, which is the same thing, for puſhing yourſelf the contrary way. At the ſame time, with your left hand, the fingers being cloſe, puſh the water behind you, and all at once turn your body and your face to the left, and the manoeuvre will be accompliſhed. If you wiſh to turn to the right, you muſt do with your right hand what you did with your left, and with your left what you did with your right. You muſt be careful when turning yourſelf never to ſtretch out your legs, and be ſure that the water be so deep that you be in no danger of hurting yourſelf.</p><p>When you are ſwimming on your belly, and wiſh to turn on your back, draw your feet in quickly, and throw them  before you ; ſtretch out your hands behind you, and keep your body firm and ſteady. When you wiſh to turn from ſwimming on your back, fold your feet at once under your body as if you were throwing them to the bottom, and at the ſame instant dart your body forwards, that you may fall upon your belly.</p><p>In swimming, the eyes ought to be turned towards heaven. This is a moſt important rule, and to the neglect of it many of the accidents which befal swimmers are owing. For when they bend their eyes downwards, they inſenſibly bend their head too, and thus the mouth being too deep in the water, may admit a quantity of it in breaking ; beſides, the more the body is ſtretched, it covers a greater part of the ſurface of the water, and conſequently its ſpecific gravity is leſs. Any perſon who will make the experiment will find</p></body></text></TEI>
