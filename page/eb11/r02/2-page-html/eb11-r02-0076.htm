<p><span class="font1">“ in a visible shape,” by which he explained that he did </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">not </span><span class="font1">mean “ indirect taxes,” a “ mode of defraying a ,share of the&nbsp;public expenses which is hardly felt.” He advocated for this&nbsp;purpose “ a direct tax, in the simple form of a capitation ” on&nbsp;every grown person. But even more than this, he was in favour&nbsp;of a form of plural voting, so that the intellectual classes of the&nbsp;community should have more proportionate weight than the&nbsp;numerically larger working-classes: “ though every one ought&nbsp;to have a voice, that every one should have an equal voice is a&nbsp;totally different proposition.” The well-informed and capable&nbsp;man’s opinion being more valuable than that of the barely&nbsp;qualified elector, it should be given more effect by a system of&nbsp;plural voting, which should give him more votes than one. As&nbsp;to the test of value of opinion, Mill was careful to say he did not&nbsp;mean property—though the principle was so important that he&nbsp;would not abolish such a test where it existed—but individual&nbsp;mental superiority, which he would gauge by the rough indication afforded by occupation in the higher forms of business or&nbsp;profession, or by such a criterion as a university degree or the&nbsp;passing of an examination of a fairly high standard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Until there shall have been devised some mode of plural voting, which may assign to education as such the degree of superior influence due to it, and sufficient as a counterpoise to the numerical&nbsp;weight of the least educated class, for so long the benefits of completely&nbsp;universal suffrage cannot be obtained without bringing with them,&nbsp;as it appears to me, more than equivalent evils.” “ Equal voting,”&nbsp;he repeated, “ is in principle wrong, because recognizing a wrong&nbsp;standard, and exercising a bad influence on the voter’s mind. It is&nbsp;not useful, but hurtful, that the constitution of the country should&nbsp;declare ignorance to be entitled to as much political power as knowledge.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Modern democracy may ignore Mill’s emphatic plea for plural voting, as it ignores his equally strong arguments against the&nbsp;ballot@@<sup>1</sup>—his contention being that secret voting violated the&nbsp;spirit of the suffrage, according to which the voter was a trustee&nbsp;for the public, whose acts should be publicly known—but Mill’s&nbsp;discussion of the whole subject proceeds on high grounds which&nbsp;are still worth careful consideration. Where a representative&nbsp;system, as such, is extolled as the ideal polity, the reservations&nbsp;made by Mill, a liberal thinker who cannot be dismissed as a&nbsp;prejudiced reactionary, should be remembered. Mill postulated,&nbsp;in any event, a state of society which was worthy of such a&nbsp;system, no less than the necessary checks and balances which&nbsp;should make it correspond to the real conditions of rational&nbsp;government. “ Representative institutions,” he pointed out,&nbsp;“ are of little value, and may bc a mere instrument of tyranny&nbsp;or intrigue, when the generality of electors are not sufficiently&nbsp;interested in their own government to give their vote, or, if&nbsp;they vote at all, do not bestow their suffrages on public grounds,&nbsp;but sell them for money, or vote at the beck of some one who has&nbsp;control over them, or whom for private reasons they desire to&nbsp;propitiate. Popular election, as thus practised, instead of a&nbsp;security against misgovernment, is but an additional wheel in&nbsp;its machinery.” When, in modern days, advocates of representative institutions seem ready to extend them to all countries,&nbsp;they become doctrinaires who depart widely from the standpoint&nbsp;of Mill, and forget that democracy is itself only a “ form of&nbsp;government,” as Sir Henry Maine insisted, for which all communities may not be ripe or fitted. The ideal form of government must be relative to a certain state of civilization and certain&nbsp;conditions of national life, and its advantages can only be tested&nbsp;by results and practical working.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(2) As regards the important question of the selection of candidates (which depends partly on their willingness to stand,&nbsp;and partly on the means available for discovering&nbsp;suitable persons), modern practice is entirely dominated&nbsp;by the organization of political parties and the requirements of party allegiance. Though much has been said as to&nbsp;the desirability or not of paying members for their services&nbsp;(see Payment of Members), this is certainly overshadowed by&nbsp;the question of the availability of really capable men at all to the&nbsp;number required, for all candidates become “ professional ”</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">politicians, whether paid or not. The ideal of having a “ representative man ” in the broader sense as a “ representative ” in the narrower is only very roughly .attained where the conditions&nbsp;of public life iriake a capacity for electioneering a necessity.&nbsp;To a large extent the political candidate depends purely upon&nbsp;the support of a party organization. His choice rests with party&nbsp;wire-pullers, and the average individual elector is confronted&nbsp;with the task of voting for some one of whom he may personally&nbsp;know very little, except that, if returned, the candidate will in&nbsp;parliament vote for measures embodying certain general principles as indicated in some vague party programme. Since&nbsp;the elector as a rule himself supports a party, he votes accordingly, but there are always a good many electors who under such a&nbsp;system fail to get a chance of voting for a candidate who fully&nbsp;represents their views. The supremacy of party interests,&nbsp;resulting from the difficulty of having any other form of electoral&nbsp;organization, is apt to bring many evils in its train, including the&nbsp;corruption of the electorate, and the practice of “ lobbying,”&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> the pressure upon members in parliament of important&nbsp;“ interests ” whose electoral assistance is indispensable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(3) The more important point to be considered here is the third. When a representative assembly is to be elected by a&nbsp;direct popular vote, it is obviously necessary </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font1"> that&nbsp;either there should be some system by which the whole&nbsp;body as a unit should elect all the members </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">en bloc,</span><span class="font1"> or, as this&nbsp;usually appears impracticable, that the mass of electors should be&nbsp;divided within defined areas, or “ constituencies ”; and (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font1">) that&nbsp;in the latter case voting shall take place for the purpose of electing&nbsp;one or more representatives of each such area according to some&nbsp;method by which due effect shall be given to the preferences of&nbsp;the electors. In theory there can be no perfectly fair arrangement&nbsp;as between constituency and constituency, where a single representative is to be returned, except on the terms that they are exactly equal in the number of electors; each elector’s voice would&nbsp;then count equally with that of any other in the nation (or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mutatis&nbsp;mutandis</span><span class="font1"> in the municipality, &amp;c.). But in practice it is difficult&nbsp;to the point of impossibility to attempt more than an arbitrary&nbsp;distribution of electoral areas, more or less approximating to&nbsp;equality; and recourse is had to the formation of constituencies&nbsp;out of geographical districts taken as units for historical or&nbsp;practical reasons, and necessarily fluctuating from time to time&nbsp;in population or influence. It may become necessary periodically to revise these areas by what in England are called Redistribution Acts, but it has to be admitted that any perfect&nbsp;system of representation is always stultified by the necessary&nbsp;inequalities involved; and what is known as “ gerrymandering ”&nbsp;is sometimes the result, when a party in power so recasts the&nbsp;electoral districts as to give more opportunity for its own&nbsp;candidates to be returned than for those of its opponents.&nbsp;This flaw is particularly noticeable when the arrangement for&nbsp;the method of voting is that which allots only one member&nbsp;or representative to each district </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(scrutin d’arrondissement).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The essential vice of this single-member system, which prevails&nbsp;in the United Kingdom@@<sup>2</sup> and the United States, is the lack of&nbsp;correspondence between the proportions in which the elected&nbsp;members of each party stand to one another and the proportions&nbsp;in which the numbers of the electors who returned them similarly&nbsp;stand; and it may well be that the minority party in the country&nbsp;obtains a majority of representatives in the assembly, or at&nbsp;any rate that a substantial minority obtains an absurdly small&nbsp;representation. “ As a result of the district system,” writes Professor J. R. Commons of Wisconsin </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Proportional Representation,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">1907), “ the national House of Representatives (in America) is&nbsp;scarcely a representative body. In the Fifty-first Congress, a&nbsp;majority of representatives were elected by a minority of the&nbsp;voters ”; the figured being 5,348,379 Republican votes with 164&nbsp;elected, and 5,502,581 Democratic votes with 161 elected.
