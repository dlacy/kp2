<p><span class="font1">liability under oath or else to pay the sum claimed ; but if he did deny it the plaintiff was entitled to require from&nbsp;him an engagement to pay one-third more by way of&nbsp;penalty in the event of judgment being against him, while&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sσi-disant</span><span class="font1"> creditor had to give an engagement to pay&nbsp;as penalty the same amount in case of judgment in favour&nbsp;of the alleged debtor. These engagements </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(sponsio et resti-ρulatiο tertiae partis)</span><span class="font1"> were not allowed in every case in&nbsp;which a definite sum of money was claimed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per condic-tioηem,</span><span class="font1"> but only when it was technically </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pecunia crédita.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">In Cicero’s time </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">creditum</span><span class="font1"> might arise either from loan,&nbsp;stipulation, or literal contract </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(expensilatio)</span><span class="font1"> ; but the last&nbsp;dated at soonest from the beginning of the 6th century,&nbsp;and stipulation apparently was a result of the Silian law&nbsp;itself, so that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pecunia crédita</span><span class="font1"> of this enactment can have&nbsp;referred only to borrowed money. The same phrase, according to Livy, was employed in the Pœtilian law ; it was&nbsp;thereby enacted, he says, that for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pecunia crédita</span><span class="font1"> the goods,&nbsp;not the body of the debtor, ought to be taken in execution. A connexion, therefore, between the Pœtilian law and&nbsp;the abolition of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nexum</span><span class="font1"> on the one hand, and the Silian&nbsp;law and the introduction of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legis actio per condictionem&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">on the other, can hardly be ignored, and raises more than&nbsp;a probability that the latter statute was a consequence of&nbsp;the former, and must have been passed immediately or soon&nbsp;after the year 428. In the action for a money debt that&nbsp;was not technically </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pecunia crédita,</span><span class="font1"> and in the action on&nbsp;the Calpurnian law, it is probable that the defendant could&nbsp;be required to negative the claim under oath </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(jusjurandum&nbsp;in jure delatuιn)</span><span class="font1"> on pain of being held as confessed ; but&nbsp;there was no penalty of a third part on either side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Little is known of the procedure @@<sup>1</sup> in this legis actio, for, in consequence of the loss of a leaf in the Verona MS., we are without part of Gaius’s account of it. It got its distinctive name, he&nbsp;says, from the condictio or requisition made by the plaintiff on the&nbsp;defendant, whom he had brought into court in the usual way,&nbsp;to attend again on the expiry of thirty days to have a judge appointed. It was probably only on the reappearance of the parties,&nbsp;and after the defendant had had time for looking into the facts,&nbsp;that the latter could be required to make oath as to his defence of&nbsp;non-indebtedness. In the action for pecunia credita it would be&nbsp;then also, and after the oath, if demanded, had been given, that&nbsp;the sponsw et restipulatio tertiae partis were exchanged ; and it is&nbsp;probable that, if either party refused on the prætor’s command so to&nbsp;oblige himself towards the other, judgment was at once pronounced&nbsp;in favour of the latter without any remit to a judex. How the&nbsp;issue was adjusted when the sponsion and restipulation were duly&nbsp;given we are not informed ; but, judging by analogy from the procedure in an action for breach of interdict under the formulai·&nbsp;system, and on the broader ground that there must have been&nbsp;machinery for a condemnation of the plaintiff on his restipulation&nbsp;in the event of his being found in the wrong, it may reasonably be&nbsp;concluded that there were in fact three concurrent issues sent to&nbsp;the same judex,—the first on the main question, the second on the&nbsp;defendant’s sponsion, and the third on the plaintiff’s restipulation. When a sum of money other than pecunia credita or a thing&nbsp;or quantity of things other than money was sued for, those subsidiary issues were unnecessary, as there was neither sponsion nor&nbsp;restipulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As Baron has demonstrated, it was not the usual practice to introduce any words explanatory of the ground of indebtedness&nbsp;when the action was either for money (other than pecunia crédita}&nbsp;or for a thing or quantity of things. It might be loan, or bequest,&nbsp;or sale, or purchase, or delict, or unjustifiable enrichment, or any&nbsp;of a hundred causae ; it would have to be condescended on of&nbsp;course before the judge ; but in the initial stage before the prætor&nbsp;and in the issue all that was necessary was the averment that the&nbsp;defendant was owing such a sum of money or such a thing. It&nbsp;was for the judge to determine whether or not the averment was&nbsp;established and, in certain cases, that non-delivery was due to the&nbsp;fault of the defendant; the plaintiff, however, was bound to make&nbsp;his averment good to the letter of his claim. In the event of the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">plaintiff being successful in an action for certapecunia, but delay was made by the defendant in satisfying the judgment, execution followed in ordinary form. How the matter was arranged in an action&nbsp;on the Calpurnian law for a certa res is not so obvious. What the&nbsp;plaintiff wanted was specific delivery or damages, and by some the&nbsp;opinion is entertained that he formulated his claim alternatively.&nbsp;Of this there is no evidence ; and Gaius’s statement that under the&nbsp;system of the legis actiones condemnation was always in the ipsa&nbsp;res, ix., the specific thing sued for, leads to the assumption that a&nbsp;judgment for the plaintiff, on which specific implement failed,&nbsp;must have been followed by an arbitrium litis acstimarulae for&nbsp;assessment of the damages in money, and that execution proceeded&nbsp;thereon as if the judgment had been for a sum of money in the&nbsp;first instance. The general opinion, however, is that the judge to&nbsp;whom the issue was remitted assessed the damages himself and as&nbsp;a matter of course,—that the instruction to him was pιαnti res&nbsp;erit, tantam ρecuniam condemnαto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Legis Actio per Manns Injectionem.</span><span class="font0">@@<sup>2</sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">—</span><span class="font1">This “ action of the law ” was ordinarily employed as a means of execution against the body of a judgment-debtor or one who had&nbsp;confessed liability in the first stage of a process. But, in&nbsp;certain cases in which it was thought proper that a creditor&nbsp;should have a more summary remedy than was afforded by&nbsp;a sacramental action or one </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per judicis postulationem,</span><span class="font1"> he&nbsp;was allowed to apprehend his debtor without any antecedent judgment ; and, if the debtor disputed liability,&nbsp;the question could be tried only in proceedings at his instance, or sometimes at that of a third party on his behalf,&nbsp;for a stay of execution. It will simplify matters, however,&nbsp;to confine our attention to it in the meantime as a means&nbsp;of execution against the body of a judgment-debtor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Gaius’s description of it is very general ; for details we are indebted principally to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Noctes Attiras</span><span class="font1"> of Aulus&nbsp;Gellius, in an account which he gives (put into the mouth&nbsp;of Sext. Cæcilius Africanus, a well-known jurist of about&nbsp;the same time as Gaius, and a contemporary of his own) of&nbsp;the provisions of the XII. Tables in reference to it. Africanus is made to say that according to his belief </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(opinor)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the words of the statute were these :—“For admitted money&nbsp;debts and in causes that have been regularly determined&nbsp;by judgment </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(aeris confessi rebusque jure judicatis)</span><span class="font1"> there&nbsp;shall be thirty days’ grace. After that there may be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mamus&nbsp;iηjectio.</span><span class="font1"> The apprehending creditor shall then bring his&nbsp;debtor before the magistrate. If he still fail to satisfy&nbsp;the judgment, and no </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">vindex</span><span class="font1"> come forward to relieve him,&nbsp;his creditor may carry him home and put him in chains.&nbsp;He may live at his own cost ; if not, his creditor must&nbsp;give him daily a pound of spelt, or more if he please.”&nbsp;Africanus continues </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">narrative : </span><span class="font1">“ There was still room for&nbsp;the parties to come to terms ; but, if they did not, the&nbsp;debtor was kept in chains for sixty days. Towards the&nbsp;end of that time he was brought before the prætor in the&nbsp;comitium on three consecutive market-days, and the amount&nbsp;of the judgment-debt proclaimed. After the third </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">capite&nbsp;poenas dabat,”—</span><span class="font1">what these words mean will be considered&nbsp;in the sequel,—“ or else he was sent across the Tiber to be&nbsp;sold to a foreigner. And this capital penalty, sanctioned&nbsp;in the hope of deterring men from unfaithfulness to their&nbsp;engagements, was one to be dreaded because of its atrocity&nbsp;and of the new terrors with which the decemvirs thought&nbsp;proper to invest it. For, if it was to more creditors than&nbsp;one that the debtor had been adjudged, they might, if they&nbsp;pleased, cut up and divide his body.
