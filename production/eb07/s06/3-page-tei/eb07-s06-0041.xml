In this attempt you will find that the water buoys you up against your inclination ; and it is not so easy a thing to sink as you imagined ; that you cannot but by active force get down to the egg. Thus you feel the power of the water to support you, and learn to confide in that power ; while your endeavours to overcome it, and to reach the <hi rend="italic">egg,</hi> teach you the manner of acting on the water with your feet and hands ; which action is afterwards used in swimming to support your head higher above water, or to go forward through it.”</p><p>As swimming is a healthy exercise and a pleasant amusement, and as a dexterity in it may frequently put it in a man’s power to save his own life and the lives of his fellow-creatures, perhaps of his dearest friends, it can neither be useless nor uninteresting to consider a few of the evolutions which a swimmer must be master of, that he move in any direction without difficulty, without danger, and without being unnecessarily fatigued.</p><p>There are several different ways of turning one’s self in swimming. You may do it in this way : turn the palm of the right hand outwards, extend the arm in the same manner, and make a contrary movement with the left hand and left arm ; then, by a gradual motion, incline your head and whole body to the left side, and the evolution will be finished. There is another way, which is easier still. Bend your head and body toward that side to which you are going to turn. If you wish to turn to the left, incline the thumb and the right hand toward the bottom, bend the fingers of the right hand, stretch it out, and use it for driving away the water sidewise, or, which is the same thing, for pushing yourself the contrary way. At the same time, with your left hand, the fingers being close, push the water behind you, and all at once turn your body and your face to the left, and the manœuvre will be accomplished. If you wish to turn to the right, you must do with your right hand what you did with your left, and with your left what you did with your right. You must be careful when turning yourself never to stretch out your legs, and be sure that the water be so deep that you be in no danger of hurting yourself.</p><p>When you are swimming on your belly, and wish to turn on your back, draw your feet in quickly, and throw them before you ; stretch out your hands behind you, and keep your body firm and steady. When you wish to turn from swimming on your back, fold your feet at once under your body, as if you were throwing them to the bottom, and at the same instant dart your body forwards, that you may fall upon your belly.</p><p>In swimming, the eyes ought to be turned towards heaven. This is a most important rule, and to the neglect of it many of the accidents which befall swimmers are owing. For when they bend their eyes downwards, they insensibly bend their head too, and thus the mouth being too deep in the water, may admit a quantity of it in breaking ; besides, the more the body is stretched, it covers a greater part of the surface of the water, and consequently its specific gravity is less. Any person who will make the experiment will find it impossible to dive w hile he keeps his head erect and his eyes fixed on the heavens.@@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p><p><hi style="color:red; font-size: 14pt; font-weight:bold;" rend="ERROR">�</hi><note place="margin" type="conversion" resp="#teitodocx"><hi rend="docxError">unable to handle picture here, no embed or link</hi></note>on your back, and raise your breast to the surface of the ■ water, keeping your body extended in the same line. Put your hands easily over the upper part of your thighs, and throw out your legs and draw them in alternately, keeping them within two feet of the surface. In this way you may advance in any direction you please. You may perhaps not like having so much of your head under water ; there is, however, no way of swimming so easy, so safe, and so little fatiguing. If you wish to swim with great rapidity, you may use your arms as well as your feet ; and you will find this the easiest way of breaking the force of the waves.In swimming on the back, one may advance forward as well as backward. For this purpose the body must be kept straight and extended ; the breast inflated, so that the hollow of the back may assume a semicircular form. The hands must recline over the upper parts of the thighs. It is also necessary to raise the legs one after another, and draw them in strongly towards the hams, and then leave them suspended in the water. This way of swimming is not only pleasant, but may serve to rest you when fatigued.When you are tired with swimming on your back and belly, you may swim on one side. When you wish to do this, sink a little your left side and raise your right ; you will immediately find yourself on your left side. Move then your left hand without either raising or sinking it ; you have only to stretch it and draw it back, as in a straight line, on the surface of the water. Independently of the pleasure which this kind of motion will give you, you will have the satisfaction of seeing both sides of the river.It is possible to swim on the belly without the assistance of the hands. For this purpose you must keep your breast erect, your neck straight, and fix your hands behind your head, or upon your back, while you move forward by employing your feet. This way is not without its advantages. It is an excellent resource when the arms are seized with a cramp, or with any indisposition which makes it painful to exert them. This in some cases may be preferable to swimming on the back ; for while in that attitude, one cannot see before them without turning every instant. If one of your legs be seized with a cramp, take hold of it with the hand opposite to it, and use the other hand and leg to advance or support yourself.A very ancient and graceful mode of swimming, is that of swimming with the hands joined. When you wish to put this in practice, join your hands, keeping the thumbs and fingers towards heaven, so that they may appear above the water ; then draw them back and push them forwards alternately from your breast. This method of swimming may be useful in several circumstances, but above all if you are entangled with grass or weeds. Your hands will then open a passage for you.As a person may sometimes have occasion to carry something in his hand in swimming, which he is anxious to preserve from the water, he may swim easily with one hand and hold a parcel in the other, as Cæsar swam with his Commentaries at Alexandria; or one may swim with both hands elevated. To perform this well, the swimmer must raise his breast, and keep it as much inflated as he can, at the same time that he supports the arms above the water. It must not be concealed that this method of swimming is attended with some danger to one who is not dexterous at the art ; for if one should imprudently draw in his breastThe easiest posture in swimming is lying on the back. When you wish to swim in this posture, lay yourself softly</p><p><hi rend="superscript">@@@,</hi> An interesting question occurs here, which deserves to be considered. Since the body, when spread upon the surface, can be supported with so little exertion, and frequently without any at all, as in swimming on the back, how comes it to pass that <hi rend="italic">a</hi> person when drowned sinks and frequently rises again some time afterwards. The reason is this. In the act of drowning, the lungs are filled with water, and consequently the body, being specifically heavier, sinks. It is well known that the human body contains a great quantity of air. This air is at first compressed by the water; and while this is the case, the body remains at the bottom ; but as soon as the air by its elasticity endeavours to disengage itself from the compression, the body is swelled and expanded, becomes specifically lighter than the water, and consequently rises to the top.</p></body></text></TEI>
