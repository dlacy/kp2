<p><span class="font0">weaver oi Charleville. The Canticles tapestries, four pieces representing scenes in Louis XIV.’s youth, originally belonged to the castle of Hauteville. In the right transept are two great Gobelins&nbsp;tapestries executed after Raphael’s designs, and dealing with the&nbsp;life of St Paul. The left transept contains a fine organ in&nbsp;flamboyant Gothic with 3516 pipes and 53 stops. The choir&nbsp;clock is ornamented with curious mechanical devices. Several&nbsp;paintings, by Titian, Tintoretto, Nicolas Poussin, and others, and&nbsp;the carved woodwork and the railings of the choir, also deserve to&nbsp;be mentioned; and among the numerous objects of antiquarian&nbsp;interest in the cathedral “ treasury ” is the reliquary of the sacred&nbsp;phial which contained the oil used in anointing the kings, but&nbsp;was broken during the Revolution. The archiépiscopal palace,&nbsp;built between 1498 and 1509, and in part rebuilt in 1675, was&nbsp;occupied by the kings on the occasion of their coronation. The&nbsp;saloon chamber, where the royal banquet was held, has an immense&nbsp;stone chimney of the 15th century, medallions of the archbishops&nbsp;of Rheims, and portraits of fourteen kings crowned in the city.&nbsp;Among the other rooms of the royal suite, all of which are of great&nbsp;beauty and richness, is that now used for the meetings of the&nbsp;Rheims Academy ; the building also contains a library of 16,000&nbsp;volumes. The chapel of the archiépiscopal palace consists of two&nbsp;stories, the upper of which still serves as a place of worship, while&nbsp;the lower is occupied by an antiquarian museum, in which is preserved the marble cenotaph (almost entire) of the consul Jovinus,&nbsp;who in the 4th century led his fellow-townsmen at Rheims to&nbsp;embrace Christianity. After the cathedral the most celebrated&nbsp;church is that of St Remi, built in the 11th and 12th centuries&nbsp;on the site of an older place of worship. The valuable monuments&nbsp;with which it was at one time filled were pillaged during the&nbsp;Revolution, and even the tomb of the saint is a modern piece of&nbsp;work ; but there still remain the 13th-century glass windows of&nbsp;the apse and tapestries representing the history of St Remigius.&nbsp;The churches of St Jacques, St Maurice (partly rebuilt in 1867),&nbsp;St André, and St Thomas (erected in 1847, under the patronage of&nbsp;Cardinal Gousset, now buried within its walls), as well as the&nbsp;chapels of the lycée and of several monasteries, are all more or less&nbsp;interesting. There are also in the city two Protestant churches&nbsp;and a synagogue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The town-house, erected in the 17th century and enlarged in 1880, has a pediment with an equestrian statue of Louis XV. and&nbsp;a tail and elegant campanile. It contains a picture gallery, a&nbsp;natural history museum, and a library of 60,000 volumes and&nbsp;1500 MSS. Of the many curious old houses which still exist in&nbsp;the town it is enough to mention the House of the Musicians, so&nbsp;called from the seated figures of musicians which decorate the&nbsp;front. Rheims is the seat of an academy of science, arts, and&nbsp;literature, founded in 1841 and composed of forty-five members, a&nbsp;preparatory school of medicine and pharmacy, several hospitals,&nbsp;and a modern theatre. It is the headquarters of one of the&nbsp;divisions of the 6th corps d’armée (Chalons). Colbert’s statue&nbsp;adorns the Cours ; Louis XV.’s (in bronze) stands in the centre&nbsp;of the handsome Place Royale ; and Marshal Drouet d’Erlon’s is&nbsp;in another of the public squares.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History.—</span><span class="font0">Rheims (Durocortorum), an important town in the time of Cæsar, made voluntary submission to the Romans and by its&nbsp;fidelity throughout the various Gallic insurrections secured the&nbsp;special favour of its conquerors. Christianity was introduced&nbsp;about the middle of the 4th century. Jovinus, already mentioned&nbsp;as an influential supporter of the new faith, repulsed the barbarians&nbsp;who invaded Champagne in 336 ; but the Vandals captured the&nbsp;town in 406 and slew St Nicasus, and Attila afterwards put&nbsp;everything to fire and sword. Clovis, after his victory at Soissons&nbsp;(486), was baptized at Rheims in 496 by St Remigius </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.vA.</span><span class="font0"> From&nbsp;this period the see acquired new lustre. The kings of the second&nbsp;and third dynasties desired to be consecrated at Rheims with the&nbsp;oil of the sacred phial which was believed to have been brought from&nbsp;heaven by a dove for the baptism of Clovis and was preserved in&nbsp;the abbey of St Remi. Historical meetings of Pope Stephen III.&nbsp;with Pippin the Short, an&lt;l of Leo III. with Charlemagne, took place&nbsp;at Rheims ; and there Louis the Débonnaire was crowned by Stephen&nbsp;IV. In the 10th century Rheims had become a centre of intellectual culture, Archbishop Adalberon, seconded by the monk Gerbert&nbsp;(Sylvester IL), having founded schools where the “liberal arts” were&nbsp;taught. Adalberon was also one of the prime authors of the revolution which put the Capet house in the place of the Carlovingians.&nbsp;The archbishops of Rheims held the temporal lordship of the city&nbsp;and coined money till the close of the 14th century. But their&nbsp;most important prerogative was the consecration of the king,—a&nbsp;privilege which was regularly exercised from the time of Philip&nbsp;Augustus to that of Charles X. Louis VII. granted the town a&nbsp;communal charter in 1139. Councils met within its walls in 1119&nbsp;and 1148. The treaty of Troyes (1420) ceded it to the English, who&nbsp;had made a futile attempt to take it by siege in 1360 ; but they&nbsp;were expelled on the approach of Joan of Arc, who in 1429 caused&nbsp;Charles VII. to be duly consecrated in the cathedral. A revolt at&nbsp;Rheims caused by the salt tax in 1461 was cruelly repressed by</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Louis XI. The town sided with the League (1585), but submitted to Henry IV. after the battle of Ivry. In the foreign invasions of&nbsp;1814 it was captured and recaptured; in 1870-71 it was made by&nbsp;the Germans the seat of a governor-general and impoverished by&nbsp;heavy requisitions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RHENANUS, Beatus (c. 1485-1547), German humanist, was born about 1485 at Schlettstadt in Alsace, where his father, a native of Rheinau, was a prosperous butcher.&nbsp;He received his early education in Schlettstadt, and&nbsp;afterwards (1503) went to Paris, where he came under the&nbsp;influence of Faber Stapulensis; here, among his other&nbsp;learned pursuits, we must include that of correcting the&nbsp;press for Henry Estienne. In 1511 he removed to Basel,&nbsp;where he became intimate with Erasmus, and took an&nbsp;active share in the publishing enterprises of Frobenius.&nbsp;Some time after 1520 he became a comparatively wealthy&nbsp;man through the death of his father ; returning to&nbsp;Schlettstadt he devoted himself to a life of learned leisure,&nbsp;enlivened with free epistolary and personal intercourse&nbsp;with Erasmus, Reuchlin, Pirckheimer, Lasky, and many&nbsp;other scholars of his time. He died at Strasburg, while&nbsp;returning from Baden in Switzerland, whither he had gone&nbsp;for his health, in 1547, leaving behind him a high reputation not only for sound learning but also for singular&nbsp;gentleness, modesty, and simplicity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His earliest publication was a life of Geiler of Strasburg (1510). Of his subsequent works the principal are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rerum Germanicarum&nbsp;Libri III.</span><span class="font0"> (1531), and editions of Velleius Paterculus (ed. princeps,&nbsp;from a MS. discovered by himself, 1520) ; Tacitus (1533, exclusive&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Histories)</span><span class="font0"> ; Livy (1535) ; and Erasmus (with a life, 9 vols, fol.,&nbsp;1540-41).</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RHETICUS, or Rhæticus, a surname given to George Joachim (1514-1576) from his birth at Feldkirch in that&nbsp;part of Tyrol which was anciently the territory of the&nbsp;Rhæti. Born in 1514, he was appointed professor of&nbsp;mathematics at Wittenberg in 1537. His first appearance&nbsp;before the public was in the character of an enthusiastic&nbsp;convert to the newly broached opinions of Copernicus. No&nbsp;sooner had he adopted these opinions than, resigning his&nbsp;chair, he repaired to Frauenberg to sit at the feet of their&nbsp;great promulgator. All his energy was forthwith devoted to&nbsp;the new system, and, as has been mentioned under Copernicus, it was he who superintended the printing of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De&nbsp;Orbium Revolutions.</span><span class="font1"> Rheticus noλv commenced his great&nbsp;treatise, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Opus Palαtinum de Trwmgulis,</span><span class="font1"> and continued to&nbsp;work at it while he occupied his old chair at Wittenberg,&nbsp;while he taught mathematics at Leipsic, while he travelled&nbsp;over different parts of the Continent, and indeed up to his&nbsp;death in Hungary in 1576. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Opus Pαlatinum</span><span class="font1"> of&nbsp;Rheticus was published by Otho in 1596. It gives tables&nbsp;of sines and cosines, tangents, etc., for every 10 seconds,&nbsp;calculated to ten places. He had projected a table of the&nbsp;same kind to fifteen places, but did not live to complete it.&nbsp;The sine table, however, was afterwards published on this&nbsp;scale under the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Thesaurus Mathemαticus</span><span class="font1">(Frankfort,&nbsp;1613) by Pitiscus, who himself carried the calculation of a&nbsp;few of the earlier sines to twenty-two places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHETORIC. A lost work of Aristotle is quoted by Diogenes Laertius (viii. 57) as saying that Empedocles&nbsp;“ invented ” (tipetv) rhetoric ; Zeno, dialectic. This is certainly not to be understood as meaning that Empedocles&nbsp;composed the first “art” of rhetoric. It is rather to be&nbsp;explained by Aristotle’s own remark, cited by Laertius&nbsp;from another lost treatise, that Empedocles was “ a master&nbsp;of expression and skilled in the use of metaphor ”—qualities which may have found scope in his political oratory,&nbsp;when, after the fall of Thrasydæus in 472 b.c., he opposed&nbsp;the restoration of a tyranny at Agrigentum. The founder&nbsp;of rhetoric as an art was Corax of Syracuse (c. 466&nbsp;b.c.). In 466 Thrasybulus the despot of Syracuse was</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
