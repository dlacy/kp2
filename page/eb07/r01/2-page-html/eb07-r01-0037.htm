<p><span class="font0">We have here supposed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a —1,</span><span class="font0"> or the inclination of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">tire of the wheel to = y ; but it is evident this must be such,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">that no rubbing of the flange will be produced on any curve on the line. We obtain this from the equation</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">βeD</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>μ</sup>~ 2(r—e)'</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We first establish the play between the rails. Allow this to be two inches, or that the flanges of the wheels in their regular position are 1 inch from the rails ; then </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">μ</span><span class="font0"> must never be&nbsp;quite equal to 1 inch, and if we give to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font0"> in the last equation&nbsp;above, its numerical value for the worst curve on the line,&nbsp;and to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">μ</span><span class="font0"> its limit, a small quantity less than half the play of&nbsp;the wheels, we obtain the value of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a,</span><span class="font0"> which we must use&nbsp;on that line, as follows :</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">_2<sub>M</sub>(r + e) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>α</sup>~ eO '</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For instance, with half thc play = 1 inch, or ∙0833 feet and μ=0∙9 inches, or, 075 feet, we haveα=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j <sup>=</sup> l0<sup>-</sup>669</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ing that if we have only one or two bad curves, we must examine whether we may not admit a little rubbing on them&nbsp;for a corresponding gain on the good ones. This investigation will shew how necessary it is that the play of the axles&nbsp;on the carriages should be as small ns can possibly be, or&nbsp;the effect of the coned wheels will be completely deranged.&nbsp;This is a matter which is much too little attended to in practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is nothing in a railway which demands such serious attention as the stations, both as to their numbers, position,&nbsp;and the mode of constructing them. The number and situation will of course be mainly determined by the nature and&nbsp;extentof the surrounding population ; and the first step should&nbsp;be to get a good map of all the places within the sphere of&nbsp;the railway, and to mark upon it thc population of each place&nbsp;from the last parliamentary census ; bearing in mind, that&nbsp;taking, for the present, railway-travelling to be twice as fast&nbsp;at half the cost of coach travelling, that a very wide portion&nbsp;of country will receive the benefit of a long line. We have&nbsp;explained this before ; but that it may be perfectly understood, we shall shortly advert to it in a different shape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For instance, suppose a line 100 miles long, and a person 50 miles at right angles to one end of it, who wants to go to&nbsp;the other end. If he travelled in a stage-coach along the&nbsp;hypothenuse of the triangle, he would go about 112 miles,&nbsp;say at 4d. per mile, his total cost would be L.l, 17s. 4d., and&nbsp;his time expended about 11¼ hours. On the contrary, if&nbsp;he came first to the terminus of the railway nearest him,&nbsp;and then went along the railway to the other terminus, he&nbsp;would have first 50 miles in a stage-coach at 4d., or 16s. 8d.,&nbsp;with an expenditure of time equal to 5 hours, and then 100&nbsp;miles by the railway at 2d., or 16s. 8d. more in 5 hours, the&nbsp;total time being 10 hours, and the total expense L.l, 13s. 4d.,&nbsp;consequently he would save 4s. in money, and l¼ hours in&nbsp;time, by taking the longest road.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is no doubt but that the greater the number of stations, the more the travelling will increase ; for it has always been hitherto found that the quick and cheap transit&nbsp;by a railway has not only increased the already existing traffic, but has actually created it where no traces could be&nbsp;found of it before. The nature of the produce, and the&nbsp;state of trade should also be taken into account in determining both the number and the situation of the stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The minor stations along the line may be divided into two classes. The first might consist of merely one room, serving&nbsp;for office and waiting-room, where nothingbutpassengersand</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">small parcels are sent either upor down. Such stations would do for small villages or points where only a limited traffic is'&nbsp;expected. We do not, however, recommend these, although&nbsp;they are used on several railways. All passengers pay alike,&nbsp;and they are therefore entitled to the same accommodation.&nbsp;The other class should be a house containing an office, waiting-room in common, or which is better, one for each class&nbsp;of passengers, ladies’ waiting-room, and two rooms for the&nbsp;inspector of police to reside in, a small office for the police,&nbsp;and a porter’s room. To this would have to be added, if water was required to be pumped, a steam-engine, and the requisite room for the engineer, a locomotive engine-house when&nbsp;necessary, and a covered space for holding spare carriages,&nbsp;trucks, horse-boxes, &amp;c., together with the requisite sheds,&nbsp;and an office for the goods department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The entrance to the station should be protected from the weather, so that when carriages drive up, the passengers&nbsp;can alight under shelter, and there should be a platform&nbsp;next the railway, about the same height as the carriage floors,&nbsp;so that the passengers can walk into the railway-carriages&nbsp;without having to climb up the steps. Arrangements&nbsp;should be made, for the passengers who are going into&nbsp;the carriages to go all in upon one side, and those going out&nbsp;should get out from the other side ; for which purpose&nbsp;the entrance should be on one side of the railway, and&nbsp;the exit on the other side. A light roof should be thrown&nbsp;over both lines of rails and their stages ; in fact, the passengers should be entirely under cover from the time of leaving the vehicles which bring them to the station, till the&nbsp;time the train takcs them away. This occasions very little&nbsp;expense, and is a great addition both to health and to comfort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For such a station two clerks would be required, one for passengers, parcels, and private carriages, tile other for&nbsp;goods. The mode of conducting the business we shall advert to in its proper place. An inspector, and about four&nbsp;policemen, with porters, according to the extent of the traffic, would probably be sufficient ; the whole should be well&nbsp;lighted up with gas, if it can be conveniently got; and it&nbsp;would much conduce to the comfort of the passengers, particularly ladies, if a decent female attended in the waiting-room, and had for sale pastry, biscuits, or sandwiches, with&nbsp;lemonade and ginger beer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Great care should be taken at each out-station, that the following things can all be simultaneously performed, viz.&nbsp;First, that the train can be setting down passengers on the&nbsp;one side who are going to remain ; secondly, taking up passengers on the other side who are going on, and this on&nbsp;both lines; thirdly, that the engine can be taking in coke&nbsp;and water, and also raking her fire, for which purpose, a&nbsp;small coke store should be built close to the water crane,&nbsp;and an ash pit properly excavated in the requisite position ;&nbsp;and, lastly, that horses and private carriages can be in a&nbsp;situation to enable them to be attached to and detached&nbsp;from the train, at the same time as the other things enumerated above are being done. It will also be requisite,&nbsp;that the same care be taken at the goods’ station, but goods’&nbsp;waggons should also be able to be attached to and detached&nbsp;from passengers’ trains, as they will often be useful, when&nbsp;the traffic in passengers runs a good deal one way, in completing the load of the engine, and economising the outlay in locomotive power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To explain how this is to be done, let us suppose a line of railway running north and south, and that the east line&nbsp;of rails is that by which the trains arrive when going from&nbsp;north to south, and the west line of rails is that by which&nbsp;they arrive when going from south to north. For the east&nbsp;line of rails, the water crane should be so far to the south&nbsp;of the station, that with an average number of carriages in&nbsp;the train, when the tender is under the crane, the middle&nbsp;of the train is opposite the station house.
