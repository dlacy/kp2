<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lunar rainbows. </span><span class="font0">The moon can produce rainbows in the same manner as the sun. The colours are much fainter, and according&nbsp;to Aristotle, who claims to be the first observer of this phenomenon,&nbsp;the lunar bows are only seen when the moon is full.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Marine rainbow</span><span class="font0"> is the name given to the chromatic displays formed by the sun’s rays falling on the spray drawn up by the wind&nbsp;playing on the surface of an agitated sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Intersecting rainbows</span><span class="font0"> are sometimes observed. They are formed by parallel rayä of light emanating from two sources, as, for example,&nbsp;the sun and its image in a sheet of water, which is situated between&nbsp;the observer and the sun. in this case the second bow is much&nbsp;fainter, and has its centre as much above the horizon as that of the&nbsp;direct system is below it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RAINOLDS (or Reynolds), JOHN (1549-1607), English divine, was born about Michaelmas 1549 at Pinhoe, near Exeter,&nbsp;and was educated at Merton and Corpus Christi Colleges,&nbsp;Oxford, becoming a fellow of the latter in 1568. In 1572-73 he&nbsp;was appointed reader in Greek, and his lectures on Aristotle’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhetoric</span><span class="font1"> laid the sure basis of his fame. He resigned the office&nbsp;in 1578 and his fellowship in 1586, through inability to agree&nbsp;with the president William Cole, and became a tutor at Queen’s&nbsp;College. By this time he had acquired a considerable reputation&nbsp;as a disputant on the Puritan side, and the story goes that&nbsp;Elizabeth visiting the university in 1592 “ schooled him for&nbsp;his obstinate preciseness, willing him to follow her laws, and not&nbsp;run before them. ” In 1593 he was made dean of Lincoln.&nbsp;The fellows of Corpus were anxious to replace Cole by Rainolds,&nbsp;and exchange was effected, Rainolds being elected president&nbsp;in December 1598. The chief events of his subsequent career&nbsp;were his share in the Hampton Court Conference, where he was&nbsp;the most prominent representative of the Puritan party and received a good deal of favour from the king, and in the Authorized&nbsp;Version of the Bible. Of this project he was initiator, and&nbsp;himself worked with the company who undertook the transla-tion of the Prophets. He died of consumption on the 21st of&nbsp;May 1607, leaving a great reputation for scholarship and high&nbsp;character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAINY, ROBERT (1826-1906), Scotch Presbyterian divine, was born on the 1st of January 1826; his father, Dr Harry&nbsp;Rainy, professor of forensic medicine in Glasgow University,&nbsp;was the son of a Sutherlandshire minister. Young Rainy was&nbsp;intended for his father’s profession, but he was caught by the&nbsp;evangelical fervour of the Disruption movement, and after&nbsp;studying for the Free Church he became a minister, first in&nbsp;'Aberdeenshire and then in Edinburgh, till in 1862 he was elected&nbsp;professor of Church history in the theological seminary, New&nbsp;College, a post he only resigned in 1900. In 1874 he was made&nbsp;principal of the college and was subsequently known as Principal Rainy. He had come to the front as a champion of the&nbsp;liberal party in the Union controversy within the Free Church,&nbsp;and in combating Dean Stanley’s Broad Church views in the&nbsp;interests of Scotch evangelicism; and about 1875 he became&nbsp;the undisputed leader of the Free Church. He guided it through&nbsp;the controversies as to Robertson Smith’s heresies, as to the use&nbsp;of hymns and instrumental music, and as to the Declaratory&nbsp;Act, brought to a successful issue the union of the Free and&nbsp;United Presbyterian Churches, and threw the weight of the&nbsp;united church on the side of freedom of Biblical criticism. He&nbsp;was the first moderator of the General Assembly of the United&nbsp;Free Church of Scotland, having previously been moderator&nbsp;of the Free General Assembly. Though not a great scholar,&nbsp;he was eminent as an ecclesiastical statesman, and his influence&nbsp;was far-reaching. After the strain of the fight with the so-called&nbsp;“Wee Frees ” in 1904-5 his health broke down, and he went&nbsp;to Australia for recovery, but died at Melbourne on the 22nd&nbsp;of December 1906.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RAIPUR, a town and district of British India, in the Chhattis-garh division of the Central Provinces. The town is 994 ft. above sea-level, 188 m. E. of Nagpur; and has a station on the&nbsp;Bengal-Nagpur railway. Pop. (1901) 32, 114. There are ruins&nbsp;of an immense fort, with many tanks and old temples. It has&nbsp;a German mission and a government high school. The Raj-kumar college, for the education of the sons of the chiefs of&nbsp;Chhattisgarh, was transferred here from Jubbulpore in 1894.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The District of Raipur has an area of 9831 sq. m. It spreads over a vast plateau closed in by ranges of hills branching&nbsp;from the great Vindhyan chain. It'is drained by the Seonath&nbsp;and the Mahanadi rivers. Geologically the country consists in the&nbsp;hilly tracts of gneiss and quartzite; the sandstone rocks in the&nbsp;west are intersected with trap dykes. Iron ore is abundant,&nbsp;and red ochre of high repute is found. In the interior the&nbsp;principal strata are a soft sandstone slate (covered generally&nbsp;by a layer of latente gravel) and blue limestone, which crops&nbsp;out in numerous places on the surface and is invariably found&nbsp;in the beds of the rivers. Throughout the plains the soil is&nbsp;generally fertile. The climate is generally good; the mean&nbsp;temperature is 78° F., and the annual rainfall averages 55 in.&nbsp;The population on the present area in 1901 was 1, 096, 858, showing a decrease of 2·5% in the decade. The principal crop is&nbsp;rice. There are manufactures of cotton goods and brassware.&nbsp;The north-west corner of the district is crossed by the main line&nbsp;of the Bengal-Nagpur railway, and a narrow-gauge branch runs&nbsp;from Raipur town due south. The district suffered severely&nbsp;from famine in 1896-97, and again in 1899-1900.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Raipur was governed by a branch of the Haihaivansi dynasty of Ratanpur for many centuries until their deposition by the&nbsp;Mahrattas in 1750. The country was then already in a condition&nbsp;of decay, and soon afterwards it relapsed into absolute anarchy.&nbsp;In 1818 it was taken under British superintendence and made&nbsp;rapid progress. It fell with the rest of the Nagpur dominions&nbsp;to the British government in 1854. In 1906 its area was&nbsp;reduced by the formation of the new district of Drug.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAIS (or Retz), GILLES DE (1404-1440), marshal of France and the central figure of a 15th-century </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cause célèbre,</span><span class="font1"> whose&nbsp;name is associated with the story of Bluebeard, was the son of&nbsp;Guy de Montmorency-Laval, the adopted son and heir of&nbsp;Jeanne de Rais and of Marie de Craon. He was born at Machc-coul in September or October 1404, and, being early left an&nbsp;orphan, was educated by his maternal grandfather, Jean de&nbsp;Craon. Chief among his great possessions was the barony of&nbsp;Rais (erected in the 16th century into the peerage-duchy of&nbsp;Retz), south of the Loire, on the marches of Brittany. He&nbsp;joined the party of the Montforts, supporting Jean V. of Brittany against the rival house of Penthièvre. He helped to&nbsp;release Duke John from Olivier de Blois, count of Penthièvre,&nbsp;who had taken him prisoner by craft, and was rewarded by&nbsp;extensive grants of land, which were subsequently commuted&nbsp;by the Breton parliament for money payments. In 1420,&nbsp;after other projects of marriage had fallen through, in two&nbsp;cases by the death of the bride, he married Katherine of&nbsp;Thouars, a great heiress in Brittany, La Vendée and Poitou.&nbsp;In 1426 he raised seven companies of men-at-arms, and began&nbsp;active warfare against the English under Artus de Richemont,&nbsp;the newly made constable of France. He had already built&nbsp;up a military reputation when he was chosen to accompany&nbsp;Joan of Arc to Orleans. He continued to be her special protector, fighting by her side at Orleans, and afterwards at Jar-geau and Patay. He had advocated further measures against&nbsp;the English on the Loire before carrying out the coronation of&nbsp;Charles VII. at Reims. On the 17th of July he was made&nbsp;marshal of France at Reims, and after the assault on Paris&nbsp;he was granted the right to bear the arms of France as a border&nbsp;to his shield, a privilege that was, however, never ratified.&nbsp;In the winter he was in Normandy, at Louviers, whether with&nbsp;a view to the release of Joan, then a prisoner at Rouen, cannot&nbsp;be stated. Meanwhile his fortune was disappearing, although&nbsp;he had been one of the richest men in France. He had expended&nbsp;great sums in the king’s service, and he maintained a court of</span></p>
