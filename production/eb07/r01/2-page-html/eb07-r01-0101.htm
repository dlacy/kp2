<p><span class="font0">ing </span><span class="font1">to </span><span class="font0">registration. It is presided over by an officer named the Registrar-General, appointed under the great seal, under whom in the office is an assistant registrar, a chief clerk,&nbsp;three first clerks, and forty-three others, who are appointed&nbsp;by the Lords of the Treasury, or by the Registrar-General&nbsp;with their approval. Instructions emanate from this office&nbsp;to all the local officers charged with the various duties of registration under this act, namely, superintendent registrars,&nbsp;with their deputies ; registrars of births and deaths, with&nbsp;their deputies; and registrars of marriages ; all of whom act&nbsp;within their respective districts under the directions of the&nbsp;Registrar-General, in whom is vested the power of dismissal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">• The duties of the Registrar-General are to make regulations, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, for the management of the General Register Office, and for&nbsp;the duties of all registrars and superintendent registrars ;&nbsp;to appoint superintendent registrars for temporary districts ;&nbsp;to examine and sanction the formation of registrars’ districts, submitted by the various boards of poor-law guardians&nbsp;for his approval; to examine and sanction, if approved,&nbsp;the plans for local register offices, to be provided by the&nbsp;poor-law guardians, and submitted by them for his approval ; to furnish the various books, forms, &amp;c. requisite&nbsp;for registration, to the various parties requiring them ; to register certified places of worship for solemnization of marriage; to decide, in cases of doubt, upon all caveats referred&nbsp;to him by the superintendent registrars, and to adjudicate&nbsp;on an appeal from the superintendent registrar’s decision on&nbsp;a caveat ; to hear and settle all matters of doubt, dispute,&nbsp;and complaint, respecting the business of registration, and&nbsp;the duties and conduct of the various officers employed&nbsp;therein ; to annex extraparochial places to registrars’ districts ; to unite two or more superintendent registrars’ districts, or to divide one superintendent registrar’s district&nbsp;into two, with the approval of the Secretary of State ; to appoint registrars or superintendent registrars if the guardians&nbsp;neglect to do so ; and to send once in every year a report and&nbsp;abstract of all registered births, deaths, and marriages, for&nbsp;the preceding year, to the Secretary of State, to be laid before parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The superintendent registrar is a local officer created by the registration and marriage acts, acting solely within his&nbsp;' district, which is either identical with a poor-law union, or&nbsp;consists, as in a few instances, of two or more unions formed into one district by the authority of the Registrar-General, or is a temporary district consisting of several temporary&nbsp;registrars’ districts united by the Registrar-General where&nbsp;there is no poor-law board of guardians. In the latter case,&nbsp;the superintendent registrar is appointed by the Registrar-General. Inthe former, he is either the clerk of the guardians,&nbsp;who, as such, is entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ex officio</span><span class="font0"> to take the office, or he is&nbsp;some person whom, the clerk not accepting, the guardians&nbsp;may have appointed, subject in either case to such qualifications as the Registrar-General may by any general rule re</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">quire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The principal duty of the superintendent registrar is to receive quarterly, from the registrars of births and deaths,&nbsp;and registrars of marriages, within his district, the certified&nbsp;copies of births, deaths, and marriages registered by them&nbsp;for the preceding quarter, and, having verified them by comparison with the original entries in the register-books, to&nbsp;certify their correctness, and transmit them to the Registrar-General ; to receive also and transmit, but not also to verify, certified copies of marriages registered by all clergymen&nbsp;of the Established Church within his district, or by any registering officer of the Quakers, or secretary of a Jewish&nbsp;synagogue, if there be any within or assigned to his district. He has also the care of the register office of his district, where are deposited all register-books within the district when filled ; and he is to make indexes of these, and&nbsp;permit searches, and give copies of entries in the register-books on payment of certain fixed fees. He may appoint registrars of marriage within his district ; and, previous notice&nbsp;having been already given, he may grant certificates for&nbsp;marriage, and, within his district, licenses for marriage, provided such license be not for marriage to be solemnized according to the forms of the Established Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The registrar of births and deaths is a local officer acting within his district, which has either been formed, with the∣&nbsp;approval of the Registrar-General, by a board of guardians<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>established under the poor-law amendment act, or is a&nbsp;temporary district formed by the Poor-law Commissioners&nbsp;where there is no such board established. In the former&nbsp;case, the registrar is appointed by the board of guardians,&nbsp;in the latter by the Poor-law Commissioners, subject, in both&nbsp;cases, to such qualifications as the Registrar-General may by&nbsp;any general rule declare to be necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His duties, which are the same in both cases, are to register, in the books provided for that purpose, every birth and death occurring within his district ; and four times in&nbsp;every year to make, on forms furnished for that purpose,&nbsp;copies of all such entries of births and of deaths for the&nbsp;quarter immediately preceding ; to certify that such copies are&nbsp;correct, and to deliver them to the superintendent registrar&nbsp;of his district, who, on comparing them with the register-book,&nbsp;which the registrar must also produce, will certify their correctness, and transmit them to the Registrar-General. He&nbsp;also delivers an account of the number of entries so copied,&nbsp;which the superintendent registrar verifies, and sanctions if&nbsp;correct, and which the registrar then presents, and obtains&nbsp;payment of the fees due thereupon from the guardians or&nbsp;overseers of the poor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The registrar of marriages is a local officer appointed by the superintendent registrar, with the approval of the guardians, or, if there be no board of guardians, of the Poor-law Commissioners, and acts solely within his district, which&nbsp;is the same as that of the superintendent registrar by whom&nbsp;he was appointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His duty is to be present at marriages not according to the forms of the Church of England, solemnized either in&nbsp;registered places of worship within his district, or in the superintendent registrar’s office ; to register the same in a book&nbsp;provided for that purpose ; and to deliver quarterly to the&nbsp;superintendent registrar certified copies of such registered&nbsp;entries, in like manner as is done by the registrar of births&nbsp;and deaths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Marriages according to the forms of the Established Church are registered, as before, by the officiating clergyman, who&nbsp;delivers certified copies quarterly to the superintendent registrar of his district, to be transmitted to the Registrar-General. The marriages are also registered at the time </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in&nbsp;duplicate ;</span><span class="font0"> and one of the books, when filled, is to be deposited immediately in the superintendent registrar’s office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Marriages according to the ceremonies of the Quakers and of the Jews are registered respectively in duplicate by&nbsp;the registering officer of the Quakers and the secretary of&nbsp;the synagogue, and certified copies are given quarterly to&nbsp;the superintendent registrar for transmission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The number of persons by whom the registration of births, deaths, and marriages under the existing law is conducted&nbsp;(exclusive of the central establishment of the General Register Office) is as follows :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are 618 superintendent registrars, each of whom may appoint a deputy, with the approval of the Registrar-General, to act for him in case of his illness or absence.&nbsp;Of these, 562 have accepted the office as clerks of boards&nbsp;of guardians, or have been appointed by the guardians ; and&nbsp;fifty-six are temporary, and have been appointed by the&nbsp;Registrar-General.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are 2193 registrars of births and deaths, each of whom may appoint a deputy, with tlιe approval of the guardians or of the Poor-law Commissioners. Of these, 1926</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
