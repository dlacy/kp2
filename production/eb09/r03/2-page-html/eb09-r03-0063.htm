                as dangerous to her interests in the East as&nbsp;Carthage had been in the AVest ;
                nor, lastly, could Rome,&nbsp;in honour, look quietly on at the ill-treatment of
                states&nbsp;which, as Greeks and as allies of her own, had a double&nbsp;claim on
                her protection. To cripple or at least to stay&nbsp;the growth of Philip’s power was
                in the eyes of the senate&nbsp;a necessity, but it was only by representing a
                AIacedonian&nbsp;invasion of Italy as imminent that they persuaded
                the&nbsp;assembly, which was longing for peace, to pass a declaration of
                    war@@<sup>1</sup> (200), an ostensible pretext for which was&nbsp;found in the
                invasion by Macedonian troops of the territory of Rome’s ally, Athens.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The war commenced in the summer of 200 </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.,</span><span class="font2"> and, though the
                landing of the Roman legions in Epirus was&nbsp;not followed, as had been hoped, by
                any general rising&nbsp;, against Philip, yet the latter had soon to discover that,
                if&nbsp;they were not enthusiastic for Rome, they were still less&nbsp;inclined
                actively to assist himself. Neither by force nor&nbsp;diplomacy could he make any
                Jirogress south of Bceotia.&nbsp;The fleets of Pergamum and Rhodes, now the
                zealous&nbsp;allies of Rome, protected Attica and watched the eastern&nbsp;coasts.
                The Achæans and Nabis of Sparta were obstinately neutral, while nearer home in the
                north the Epirots&nbsp;and Ætolians threatened Thessaly and AIacedonia. His&nbsp;own
                resources both in men and in money had been severely&nbsp;strained by his constant
                    wars,@@<sup>2</sup> and the only ally who&nbsp;could have given him effective
                assistance, Antiochus, was&nbsp;fully occupied with the conquest of Ccele-Syria. It
                is no&nbsp;wonder then that, in spite of his dashing generalship and&nbsp;high
                courage, he made but a brief stand. T. Quinctius&nbsp;Flamininus (consul 198), in
                his first year of command,&nbsp;defeated him on the Aous, drove him back to the pass
                of&nbsp;Tempe, and in the next year utterly routed him at Cynos-cephalæ. Almost at
                the same moment the Achæans, who'&nbsp;had now joined Rome, took Corinth, and the
                Rhodians&nbsp;defeated his troops in Caria.@@<sup>3</sup> Further resistance
                was&nbsp;impossible ; Philip submitted, and early the next year&nbsp;a Roman
                commission reached Greece with instructions to&nbsp;arrange terms of peace. These
                were such as effectually&nbsp;secured Rome’s main object in the war, the removal of
                all&nbsp;danger to herself and her allies from AIacedonian aggression.@@<sup>4</sup>
                Philip was left in possession of his kingdom,&nbsp;but was degraded to the rank of a
                second-rate power,&nbsp;deprived of all possessions in Greece, Thrace, and
                Asia&nbsp;AIinor, and forbidden, as Carthage had been in 201, to&nbsp;wage war
                without the consent of Rome, whose ally and&nbsp;friend he now became. AIacedon thus
                weakened could&nbsp;no longer be formidable, but might yet be useful, not&nbsp;only
                as a barrier against Thracians and Celts,@@<sup>5</sup> but as a</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">check upon anti-Roman intrigues in Greece.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The second point in the settlement now effected by Rome was the
                liberation of the Greeks, The “ freedom&nbsp;of Greece ” was proclaimed at the
                Isthmian games amid a&nbsp;scene of wild enthusiasm,@@<sup>6</sup> which reached its
                height when&nbsp;two years later (194) Flamininus withdrew his trooj&gt;s
                even&nbsp;from the “ three fetters of Greece ”—Chalcis, Demetrias,&nbsp;and
                    Corinth.@@<sup>7</sup> There is no reason to doubt that, in acting&nbsp;thus,
                not only Flamininus himself, but the senate and&nbsp;people at home were influenced,
                partly at any rate, by&nbsp;feelings of genuine sympathy with the Greeks and
                reverence for their past. It is equally clear that no other&nbsp;course was open to
                them. For Rome to have annexed&nbsp;Greece, as she had annexed Sicily and Spain,
                would&nbsp;have been a flagrant violation of the pledges she had&nbsp;repeatedly
                given both before and during the war ;&nbsp;the attempt would have excited the
                fiercest opposition,</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">and would probably have thrown the Asiatic as well as the European
                Greeks into the arms of Antiochus. But a&nbsp;friendly and independent Greece would
                be at once a check&nbsp;on AIacedon, a barrier against aggression from the
                East,&nbsp;and a promising field for Roman commerce. Nor while&nbsp;liberating the
                Greeks did Rome abstain from such arrangements as seemed necessary to secure the
                predominance of&nbsp;her own influence. In the Peloponnese, for instance,
                the&nbsp;Achæans were rewarded by considerable accessions of&nbsp;territory; and it
                is possible that the Greek states, as allies&nbsp;of Rome, were expected to refrain
                from war upon each&nbsp;other without her consent. The failure of the
                policy,&nbsp;after all, was due to the impracticability of the Greeks,&nbsp;and the
                intensity of their civic and tribal feuds. To suppose as some have done that Rome
                intended it to fail is to&nbsp;attribute to the statesmen of the generation of
                Scipio and&nbsp;Flamininus even more than the cynicism of the time of
                    L.&nbsp;AIummius.@@<sup>8</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Antiochus III. of Syria, Philip’s accomplice in the pro-j&gt;osed
                partition of the dominions of their common rival, Egypt, returned from the conquest
                of Coele-Syria (198) to&nbsp;learn first of all that Philip was hard pressed by
                the&nbsp;Romans, and shortly afterwards that he had been decisively beaten at
                Cynoscephalæ. It was already too late&nbsp;to assist his former ally, but Antiochus
                resolved at any&nbsp;rate to lose no time in securing for himself the
                possessions&nbsp;of the Ptolemies in Asia Alinor and in eastern Thrace,&nbsp;which
                Philip had claimed, and which Rome now pronounced free and independent. In 197-196
                he overran&nbsp;Asia AIinor and crossed into Thrace.@@<sup>9</sup> But Antiochus
                was&nbsp;pleasure-loving, irresolute, and above all no general, and&nbsp;it was not
                until 192 that the urgent entreaties of the&nbsp;Ætolians, and the withdrawal of the
                Roman troops from&nbsp;Greece, nerved him to the decisive step of crossing
                the&nbsp;Ægean ; and even then the force he took with him was so&nbsp;small as to
                show that he completely failed to appreciate&nbsp;the nature of the task before
                    him.@@<sup>10</sup> At Rome the&nbsp;prospect of a conflict with Antiochus
                excited great&nbsp;anxiety, and it was not until every resource of
                diplomacy&nbsp;had been exhausted that war was declared.@@<sup>11</sup> At a
                distance, indeed, Antiochus, the great king, the lord of all&nbsp;the forces of
                Asia, seemed an infinitely more formidable&nbsp;opponent than their better known
                neighbour Philip, and&nbsp;a war against the vaguely known powers of the East a
                far&nbsp;more serious matter than a campaign in Thessaly. War,&nbsp;however, was
                unavoidable, unless Rome was to desert her&nbsp;Greek allies, and allow Antiochus to
                advance unopposed&nbsp;to the coasts of the Adriatic. And the war had no
                sooner&nbsp;commenced than the real weakness which lay behind the&nbsp;magnificent
                pretensions of the “king of kings” was&nbsp;revealed.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Had Antiochus acted with energy when in 192 he landed in Greece, he
                might have won the day before the&nbsp;Roman legions appeared. As it was, in spite
                of the&nbsp;warnings of Hannibal,@@<sup>12</sup> who was now in his camp, and
                of&nbsp;the Ætolians, he frittered away valuable time between his&nbsp;pleasures at
                Chalcis and useless attacks on petty Thessalian&nbsp;towns. In 191 Glabrio landed at
                the head of an imposing force ; and a single battle at Thermopylæ broke
                the&nbsp;courage of Antiochus, .who hastily recrossed the sea to&nbsp;Ephesus,
                leaving his Ætolian allies to their fate. But&nbsp;Rome could not pause here. The
                safety of her faithful&nbsp;allies, the Pergamenes and Rhodians, and of the
                Greek&nbsp;cities in Asia Alinor, as well as the necessity of
                chastising&nbsp;Antiochus, demanded an invasion of Asia. A Roman fleet</span></p>
