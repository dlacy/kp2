<p><span class="font0">are at all times difficult to aſcertain with preciſion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is therefore much more convenient to compute from the real dimenſions of the orifice, and to correct this&nbsp;computed diſcharge, by means of an actual compariſen&nbsp;of the computed and effective diſcharges in a ſeries of&nbsp;experiments made in ſituations reſembling thoſe caſes&nbsp;which moſt frequently occur in practice. This correction or its cauſe, in the mechaniſm of thoſe internal motions, is generally called Contraction by the writers&nbsp;on hydraulics; and it is not confined to a hole in a&nbsp;thin plate : it happens in ſome degree in all caſes&nbsp;where fluids are made to paſs through narrow places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It happens in the entry into all pipes, canals, and ſluices ; nay even in the paſſage of water over the&nbsp;edge of a board, ſuch as is uſually ſet up on the&nbsp;head of a dam or weir, and even when this is immer-ſed in water on both ſides, as in a bar or keep, frequently employed ſor raiſing the waters of the level&nbsp;ſtreams in Flanders, in order to render them navigable.&nbsp;We mentioned an obſervation $ of Mr Buat to this effect, when he ſaw a gooſherry rife up from the bottom&nbsp;of the canal along the face of the bar, and then rapidly fly over its top. We have attempted to repreſent&nbsp;this motion of the filaments in theſe different fιtuation6.&nbsp;Fig. 5. A ſhows the motion through a thin plate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">B ſhows the motion when a tube of about two diameters long is added, and when the water flows with a full .mouth. This does not always happen in ſo ſhort&nbsp;a pipe (and never in one that is ſhorter), but the water&nbsp;frequently detaches itſelf from the ſides of the pipe,&nbsp;and flows with a contracted jet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">C </span><span class="font0">ſhows the motion when the pipe projects into the inſide of the veſſel. In this caſe it is difficult to&nbsp;make it flow full.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">D </span><span class="font0">repreſents a mouth-piece fitted to the hole, and formed agreeably to that ſhape which a jet would aſ-ſume of itſelf. In this caſe all contraction is avoided,&nbsp;becauſe the mouth of this pipe may be conſidered as&nbsp;the real orifice, and nothing now diminiſhes the diſcharge but a trifling friction of the ſides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">E ſhows the motion of water over a dam or weir, where the fall is free or unobſtructed ; the ſurface of&nbsp;the lower ſtream being lower than the edge or ſole of&nbsp;the waſte-board.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">F is a ſimilar repreſentation of the motion of water over what we would call a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bar</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">keep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was one great aim of the experiments of Michelotti and Boffut to determine the effects of contraction in theſe caſes. Michelotti, after carefully obſerving the&nbsp;,form and :dimenſions of the natural jet, made various&nbsp;mouth-pieces reſembling it, till he obtained one which&nbsp;produced the ſmalleſt diminution of the computed diſcharge, or till the diſcharge computed for the area of&nbsp;its ſmaller end approached the neareſt to the effective&nbsp;diſcharge. And he at laſt obtained one which gave a&nbsp;diſcharge of 983, when the natural diſcharge would&nbsp;have been 1000. This piece was formed by the revolution of a trochoid round the axis of the jet, and the&nbsp;dimenſions were as follow :</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h4><span class="font1">Diameter of the outer orifice &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 36</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">---inner orifice &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 46</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Length of the axis &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;≈ 96</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The reſults of the experiments of the Abbé Boſſiit and of Michelotti ſcarcely </span><span class="font1">differ, and they are expreſ-<sub>;</sub>ſed in the following table 4</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font0">The numbers in the laſt column of this little table are the cubical inches of water diſcharged in a ſecond&nbsp;when the height </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span class="font0"> is one inch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It muſt be obſerved that the diſcharges aſſigned here for the weir and bar relate only to the contractions oc-cafioned by the paſſage over the edge of the board.&nbsp;The weir may alſo ſuffer a diminution by the contractions at its two ends, if it ſhould be narrower than&nbsp;the ſtream, which is generally the caſe, becauſe the&nbsp;two ends are commonly of ſquare maſonry or woodwork. Tſhe contraction there is nearly the ſame with&nbsp;that at the edge of a thin plate. But this could not&nbsp;be introduced into this table, becauſe its effect on the&nbsp;expence is the ſame in quantity whatever is the length&nbsp;of the waſte-board of the weir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In like manner, the diminution of diſcharge through a ſluice could not be expreſſed here. When a ſluice is&nbsp;drawn up, but its lower edge ſtill remains under water,&nbsp;the diſcharge is contracted both above and at the ſides,&nbsp;and the diminution of diſcharge by each is in proportion to its extent. It is not eaſy to reduce either of&nbsp;theſe contractions to computation, but they may be very eaſily obſerved. We frequently can obſerve the water, at coming out of a ſluice into a mill-courſe, quit the&nbsp;edge of the aperture, and ſhow a part of the bottom&nbsp;quite dry. This is always the caſe when the velocity&nbsp;of efflux is conſiderable. When it is very moderate,&nbsp;this place is occupied by an eddy water almoſt ſtagnant.&nbsp;When the head of water is 8 or ϊθ inches, and runs&nbsp;off freely, the ſpace left between it and the ſides is about&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">1</span><span class="font0">4- inches. If the ſides of the entry have a ſlope, this&nbsp;void ſpace can never appear ; but there is always this&nbsp;t endency to convergence, which diminiſhes the quantity&nbsp;of the diſcharge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It will frequently abridge computation very much to conſider the water diſcharged in theſe different ſituations as moving with a common velocity, which we con&nbsp;ceive as produced not by a fall from the ſurface of the&nbsp;fluid (which is exact only when the expence is equal to&nbsp;the natural expence), but by a fall </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span class="font0"> accommodated to&nbsp;the diſcharge r or it is convenient to know the height&nbsp;which would produce that very velocity which the water iſſues with in theſe ſituations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And alſo, when the water is obſerved to be actually moving with a velocity </span><span class="font1">V, </span><span class="font0">and we know whether it is&nbsp;coming through a thin plate, through a tube, over </span><span class="font1">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">dam, &amp;c. it is neceſſary to know the preſſure or head&nbsp;of water </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span class="font0"> which has actually produced this velocity.&nbsp;It is convenient therefore to have the following num</span><span class="font1">bers </span><span class="font0">in readineſs.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
