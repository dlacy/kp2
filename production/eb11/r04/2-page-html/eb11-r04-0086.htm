The line of the&nbsp;street was parallel to that of the later Aurelian wall, which at&nbsp;this part was built against the back of this row of houses. At&nbsp;the same time, behind the line of houses were uncovered fine&nbsp;peperino and tufa piers of the aqueduct rebuilt by Augustus,&nbsp;one arch of which forms the Porta S. Lorenzo. These interesting&nbsp;remains have all been completely destroyed. A fine house of&nbsp;the end of the 1st century </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.,</span><span class="font2"> with richly decorated walls, was&nbsp;exposed in June 1884 against the slope of the Quirinal, near the&nbsp;Palazzo Colonna; it was immediately destroyed to make room for&nbsp;new buildings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The praetorian camp was first made permanent and surrounded with a strong wall by the emperor Tiberius (Suet. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tib,</span><span class="font2"> 37). Owing&nbsp;to the camp being included in the line of tne Aurelian&nbsp;wall, a great part of it still exists; it is a very interesting&nbsp;specimen of early imperial brick-facing. The wall is only</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">12 to 14 ft. high, and has thinly scattered battlements, at intervals of 20 ft. The north-east gate (Poria </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Principalis I)extra)</span><span class="font2"> is well&nbsp;preserved; it had a tower on each side, now greatly reduced in&nbsp;height, in which are small window's with arched heads moulded&nbsp;in one slab of terra-cotta. The brick-facing is very neat and&nbsp;regular,—the bricks being about IJ in. thick, with i-in. joints.&nbsp;On the inside of the wall are rows of small rooms for the&nbsp;guards. Part of the Porta Praetoria also remains. . This camp&nbsp;was dismantled by Constantine, who removed its inner walls;&nbsp;the outer ones were left because they formed part of the Aurelian&nbsp;circuit. The present wall is nearly three times the height of&nbsp;the original camp wall. The upper part was added when&nbsp;Aurelian included it in his general circuit wall, round Rome.&nbsp;The superior neatness and beauty of Tiberius's brick-facing make&nbsp;it easy to distinguish where his work ends and that of the later&nbsp;emperors begins. Owing to the addition of the later wall it&nbsp;requires some care to trace the rows of battlements which belong&nbsp;to the camp.</span></p>

Abr. 2127); and recent investigations have shown that the rotunda is a work of Hadrian's reign,&nbsp;bricks of that period having been found in all parts of the building.&nbsp;Excavations have made it probable that the site of the rotunda was&nbsp;previously occupied by an open piazza, whose pavement of coloured&nbsp;marbles has been discovered beneath the flooring, and that Agrippa's&nbsp;Pantheon covered the present piazza and faced southward. The&nbsp;present portico has been reconstructed; it is probable that Agrippa's&nbsp;portico had ten columns in the front. The ceiling of the portico too&nbsp;was of bronze, supported by hollow bronze girders,<sup>@@1</sup> which remained&nbsp;till Urban VIII. melted them to make cannon for S. Angelo; the&nbsp;bronze weighed 450,000 lb. The bronze tiles of the dome were&nbsp;stolen long before by Constans II., in 063, but on their way to&nbsp;Constantinople they were seized by the Saracens. The portico has&nbsp;eight columns on the front and three on the.sides, all granite monoliths&nbsp;except the restored ones on the east side,—sixteen in all. The&nbsp;capitals are Corinthian, of white marble; the tympanum </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(¿«t6s)</span><span class="font2"> of&nbsp;the pediment was filled with bronze reliefs of tne battle of the gods&nbsp;and the giants.<sup>@@2</sup> The walls of the circular part, nearly 20 ft. thick,&nbsp;are of solid tufa concrete, thinly faced with brick. The enormous&nbsp;dome, 142 ft. 6 in. in span, is cast in concrete made of pumice-stone,&nbsp;pozzolana and lime; being one solid mass, it covers the building like a shell, free from any lateral thrust at the haunches.&nbsp;On the face of the concrete is a system of superimposed relieving&nbsp;arches in brick. These no longer possess any constructive value,&nbsp;but were designed to preserve the stability of the dome whilst the&nbsp;concrete became, firmly, set. Round the central opening or hypae-thrum. still remains a ring of enriched mouldings in gilt Ijronze, the&nbsp;only bit left of the bronze which once covered the whole dome. The&nbsp;lower storey of the circular part and the walls of the projecting&nbsp;portico were covered with slabs of Greek marble; a great part of the&nbsp;latter still remains, enriched with Corinthian pilasters and bands&nbsp;of sculptured ornament. The two upper storeys of the drum were&nbsp;covered outside with hard stucco of pounded marble. Inside the&nbsp;whole was lined with a great variety of rich oriental marbles. This&nbsp;magnificent interior, divided into two orders by an entablature&nbsp;supported on columns and pilasters, has been much injured by</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font2">Close by the Pantheon is the church of S.

<p><span class="font2">Some remains exist of the Golden House of Nero, which, including its parks, lakes, &amp;c., covered an incredibly large space of ground,&nbsp;extending from the Palatine, over the Velia and the site&nbsp;of the temple of Venus and Rome, to the Esquiline, filling&nbsp;the great valley between the Caelian and the Esquiline&nbsp;where the Colosseum stands, and reaching far over the&nbsp;Esquiline to the great reservoir now called the “ Sette Sale.” No&nbsp;other extravagances or cruelties of Nero appear to have offended&nbsp;the Roman people so much as the erection of this enormous palace,&nbsp;which must have blocked up many important roads and occupied the site of a whole populous quarter. It was partly to make&nbsp;restitution for this enormous theft of land that Vespasian and Titus&nbsp;destroyed the Golden House and built the Colosseum and Thermae&nbsp;of Titus on part of its site. Adjoining the baths of Titus were thosé&nbsp;built on a much larger scale by Trajan. Under the substructions&nbsp;of these extensive remains of the Golden House still exist;<sup>@@7</sup> and at&nbsp;one point, at a lower level still, pavements and foundations remain&nbsp;of one of the numerous houses destroyed by Nero to clear the site.&nbsp;The great bronze colossus of Nero, 120 ft. high (Suet. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nero,</span><span class="font2"> 31),&nbsp;which stood in one of the porticus of the Golden House, was moved&nbsp;by Vespasian, with head and attributes altered to those of Apollo&nbsp;(Helios), on to the Velia; and it was moved again by Hadrian,&nbsp;when the temple of Rome was built, on to the base which still exists&nbsp;near the Colosseum. Several coins show this colossus by the side&nbsp;of the Colosseum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Under the Palazzo Doria, the church of S.
