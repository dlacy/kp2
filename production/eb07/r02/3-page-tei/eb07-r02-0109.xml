The <hi rend="italic">Ring, Oath and Conscience, Diodatis<hi rend="sup">,</hi>  Birth,</hi>  the <hi rend="italic">Dance of Death, </hi>and the <hi rend="italic">Red Dragon,</hi>  are masterpieces in this style of invention, which, though of a sufficiently prosaic character, yet possesses, at least, this cardinal merit, that it is rarely tedious.</p><p>Historical romances have always been numerous in Germany ; and after the appearance of those of Sir Walter Scott, they became still more so. Some of the chivalrous pictures ofTromlitz, Van de Velde, and Blumenhagen in this style are spirited, but in general the historical romance of Germany does not rise above mediocrity. “ Sunt bona, sunt quædam mediocria, <hi rend="italic">sunt mala plwα.<hi rend="sup">η</hi></hi>  Let us except the very remarkable tale of <hi rend="italic">Michael Kohlhaαs,</hi>  by the unfortunate dramatist Kleist, (1776—1811). In all of Kleist’s tales there is too much of a spectral and fatalistic character ; he delighted to contemplate and to delineate life as</p><lb/><p>necessitated by a mysterious and iron destiny. <hi rend="italic">Kohlhaas </hi>is not entirely free from a tinge of the supernatural, which harmonizes ill with the deep, humble, human interest of the tale itself ; and no where does the idea of a grim and unrelenting fate appear in more saddening colours. There is truth, therefore, in Goethe’s remark as to this romance, that “ it brings prominently into view a dissonant principle in nature, with which poetry ought not to meddle, with which it cannot reconcile itself, let the handling of the matter be never so exquisite.” And yet this vigorous and truthful picture from the Lutheran times, must be to English readers an object of interest, from the contrast it exhibits to the usual style of the German novel ; for it is told with a directness, a simplicity, a dramatic liveliness, and an absence of unnecessary reflection, which are qualities of rare occurrence beyond the Rhine.</p><p>(w.w. w.w.)</p><lb/><p>ROMAGNA, a province of Italy, in the pope’s territories, bounded on the north by the Ferrarese, on the south by Tuscany and the duchy of Urbino, on the east by the gulf of Venice, and on the west by the Bolognese and a part of Tuscany. It is fertile in corn, wine, oil, fine fruits, and pastures. It has also mines, mineral waters, and salt-works, which make its principal revenue. Ravenna is the capital town.</p><p>ROMANIA or Rumelia, an extensive province of the Turkish empire in Europe, called by the Turks the Ejelat Rumili, or the land of the Romans. In the more extended sense it comprehends thc whole countries to the west and the north of the Bosphorus, but in a more peculiar sense it included the ancient Thrace; Bulgaria, Servia, and Greece, except a strip on the coast and the islands which are in the Pashalic of the Capudan Pascha, and one distinguished as the Ejalet Dscheseir. It is divided into 24 districts or sand-giacets, extends over 105,182 square miles, and probably contains 6,000,000 inhabitants. The capital of it, as of the empire, is Constantinople or Istambol.</p><p>ROMANO, Giulio, a famous painter of the Roman school, was born at Rome in 1492. He was the favourite pupil of Raphael, who had such an affection for him, that he appointed him, with John Francis Penni, his heir. He first signalised himself by his Battle of Constantine, which he painted from a design of Raphael’s, and which was particularly admired by Poussin.</p><p>When he had completed the hall of Constantine in the Vatican, from Raphael’s designs, he went to Mantua, where the patronage of the Gonzaghi family excited him to those great works, and those magnificent plans by which Mantua and the palace Del T. have been so highly decorated. In tlle decorations of this palace, Julio prepared the cartoons, and had the pictures executed by his pupils ; but he afterwards corrected and finished them. Modem pencils are said to have covered the touches of Julio, especially in the Fable of Psyche, the Allegories of Human Life, and the Giants Storming Heaven, where his composition and design are alone seen. In the fresco paintings of the old palace or corte of Mantua, which refer principally to the histories of the Trojan war, his peculiar merits are better perceived.</p><p>Helen Asleep, Vulcan forging arms for Achilles, are considered beautiful, and Minerva slaying Ajax is regarded as sublime.</p><p>The most remarkable of the altar pieces of our artist are the three frescoes of St. Marco ; and in the church of St. Christofero, the athletic figure of that saint supporting the infant Jesus. His Martyrdom of St. Stephen on the head altar of the church of St. Stephen at Genoa, is preferred to them all.</p><p>His conceptions were more extraordinary and more elevated than even those of his master, but not so natural. He was wonderful in the choice of attitudes ; but did not perfectly understand the lights and shades, and is frequently harsh and ungraceful. The folds ofhis draperies, says Du Fresnoy, are neither beautiful nor great, easy nor natural, but all extravagant, like the fantastical habits of comedians. He was, however, superior to most painters, by his profound knowledge of antiquity; and, by conversing with the works ofthe most excellent poets, particularly Homer, he made himself master of the qualifications necessarily required in a great designer. Julio Romano was also well skilled in architecture. He was employed by Cardinal de Medicis, who was afterwards pope under the name of Clement VII. ; he ultimately settled in Mantua, whither he was invited by Frederick Gonzago, marquis of that city, in order to avoid his being justly punished for having drawn at Rome the designs of twenty obscene plates, engraved by Mark Anthony, to which Aretine added the same number of sonnets. Julio Romano embellished the city of Mantua with many of his performances, both in painting and architecture, and died in that city in 1546, at 54 years of age.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Romans, a city of France, in the department of the Drome, and the arrondisement of Valence, situated on the right bank of the Isere.
