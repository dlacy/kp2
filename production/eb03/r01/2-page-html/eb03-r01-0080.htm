<p><span class="font1">on his journey, the mayor of that city hearing that her majeſty was fending a meffenger into Ireland, and he&nbsp;being a churchman, waited on the Doctor, who in diſcourſe with the mayor taketh out of a cloke-bag a&nbsp;leather box, faying unto him, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Here is a commjffton that&nbsp;fijall !afii the Heretics of Ireland,</span><span class="font1"> calling the Proteſtants&nbsp;by that title. The good woman of the houſe being-well affected to the Proteftant religion, and alſo having&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">brother named </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">John Edmonds</span><span class="font1"> of the ſame, then a citizen in Dublin, was much troubled at the Doctor’s&nbsp;words ; but watching her convenient time while the&nbsp;mayor took his leave, and the Doctor complimented&nbsp;him down the flairs, ſhe opens the box, takes the commiſſion out, and places in lieu thereof a ſheet of paper&nbsp;with a pack of cards wrapt up therein, the knave of&nbsp;clubs being faced uppermoſt. The Doctor coming up&nbsp;to his chamber, ſuſpecting nothing of what had been&nbsp;done, put up the box as formerly. The next day going to tbe water.ſide, wind and weather ſerving him,&nbsp;he fails towards Ireland, and landed on the 7th of Gc-tober 1558 at Dublin. Then coming to the eaſtle,&nbsp;the Lord Fitz-AYalters being lord-deputy, ſent for&nbsp;him to come before him and the privy-council ; who,&nbsp;coming in, after he had made a fpeech relating upon&nbsp;what account he came over, he preſents the box unto&nbsp;the lord-deputy ; who cauſing it to be opened, that the&nbsp;.fecretary might read the commiſſion, there was nothing</span></p>

Then the&nbsp;lord-deputy made anſwer : Let us have another commiſſion, and we will ſhuffle the cards in the meanwhile.&nbsp;The Doctor being troubled in his mind, went away, and&nbsp;returned into England, and coming to the court obtained another commiſſion ; but flaying for a wind on the&nbsp;water-iide, news came to him that the queen was dead :&nbsp;and thus God preſerved the Proteſtants of Ireland.”&nbsp;Queen Elizabeth was ſo delighted with this ſtory, which&nbsp;was related to her by lord Fitz-walter on his return to&nbsp;England, that file ſent for Elizabeth Edmonds, whoſe&nbsp;huſhand’s name was </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Matterjhad,</span><span class="font1"> and gave her a penſion&nbsp;of 40 1. during her life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Scotland, the feeds oſ reformation were very early ſown, by ſeveral noblemen who had reſided in Germany&nbsp;during the religious diſputes there. But ſor many years&nbsp;it was ſuppreffed by the power of the pope, ſeconded by&nbsp;inhuman laws and barbarous executions. The moſt eminent oppoſer of the Papal juriſdiction was John Knox,&nbsp;a diſciple of Calvin, a man of great zeal and invincible&nbsp;fortitude. On all occaſions he raiſed the drooping ſpi-rits of the reformers, and encouraged them to go on&nbsp;with their work notwithſtanding the oppoſition and&nbsp;treachery of the queen-regent; till at laſt, in 1561, by&nbsp;the aſſiſtance of an Engliſh army ſent by Elizabeth, Po-pery was in a manner totally extirpated throughout the&nbsp;kingdom. From this period the form of doctrine, wor-Ihip, and diſcipline eſtabliſhed by Calvin at Geneva, has&nbsp;had the aſcendancy in Scotland. But for an account&nbsp;of the difficulties which the Scottiſh reformers had to&nbsp;ſtruggle with, and the manner ia which theſe were&nbsp;overcome, &amp;c. ſee Scotlanb.</span></p>

Themanſtayer underwent two,&nbsp;trials : ſirſt before the judges of the city of refuge t®&nbsp;which he had fled ; and ſecondly before the judges of&nbsp;his own city.
