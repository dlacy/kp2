        <p><span class="font1">than regal splendour, and under Nero we find all the outward
                accessories of monarchy present, the palace, the&nbsp;palace guards, the crowds of
                courtiers, and a court&nbsp;ceremonial. In direct opposition to the republican
                theory&nbsp;of the principate, the members of the princeps’s family&nbsp;share in
                the dignities of his position. The males bear the&nbsp;cognomen of Cæsar, and are
                invested, as youths, with high&nbsp;office ; their names and even those of the
                females are&nbsp;included in the yearly prayers for the safety of
                    the&nbsp;princeps@@<sup>1</sup> ; their birthdays are kept as festivals ;
                the&nbsp;prætorian guards take the oath to them as well as to the&nbsp;princeps
                himself. Finally, the growing practice of Cæsar&nbsp;worship invested the chief
                magistrate of the Roman&nbsp;commonwealth with the divine attributes ascribed
                to&nbsp;Eastern monarchs.@@<sup>2</sup> The death of Nero was followed, it&nbsp;is
                true, by a partial reaction. Not only Galba and the&nbsp;Flavian emperors but
                Trajan, Hadrian, and the Antonines&nbsp;at once affected a certain simplicity in
                their personal&nbsp;habits, and discountenanced the excessive servility
                and&nbsp;adulation encouraged by Caligula and Nero. But this&nbsp;reaction served
                only to bring into clearer relief the continued advance made towards the
                establishment of an&nbsp;autocratic and military rule. Caligula, Claudius,
                and&nbsp;Nero were all first saluted as imperatores by the&nbsp;
                soldiery and then invested with their powers by the&nbsp;senate,@@<sup>3</sup> but
                this reversal of the constitutional order&nbsp;was rendered less noticeable by the
                fact that the choice&nbsp;was still made in Rome, and that it fell in each case
                on&nbsp;one whose birth already marked him out as the natural&nbsp;successor to the
                purple. The salutation of Galba by&nbsp;the legions in Spain marks the opening of a
                new epoch.@@<sup>4&nbsp;</sup>Thenceforward, if the legions do not actually select
                the&nbsp;princeps, it is their acceptance of him which is the one&nbsp;essential
                condition of his tenure of power, and it is on&nbsp;their support that he relies.
                Vitellius and Vespasian were&nbsp;chosen by the legions of Germany and Syria, as
                Galba&nbsp;had been by those of Spain. Domitian emphasized the&nbsp;military
                character of his rule by entering the senate in&nbsp;the triumphal
                    dress;@@<sup>5</sup> and under the great soldier Trajan,&nbsp;whose adoption by
                Nerva was a frank confession of the&nbsp;necessities of the case, the military title
                “ imperator ” was&nbsp;already superseding the older and more constitutional&nbsp;“
                princeps.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Closely connected with the increasingly military character of the
                emperor’s position was the gradual severance of the old ties which connected the
                emperor, as chief&nbsp;magistrate, with Rome, as the traditional seat and
                centre&nbsp;of political power. Galba, Vitellius, and Vespasian were&nbsp;already
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span
                class="font1"> emperors when they entered Rome from&nbsp;their distant provinces to
                claim the legal confirmation by&nbsp;the senate. Trajan and Hadrian were both
                provincials by&nbsp;birth ; the former did not enter Rome for a full year
                after&nbsp;his accession, and Hadrian courteously apologized to the&nbsp;senate for
                taking up the imperium in Syria before&nbsp;his acceptance by that
                    body.@@<sup>6</sup> The connexion between&nbsp;the emperors and Rome was further
                weakened by the&nbsp;increasing frequency and length of their absences from
                the&nbsp;city. Life in Rome was no doubt irksome to men trained&nbsp;in camps, as
                Trajan had been, and the state of affairs was&nbsp;such as imperatively to require
                the emperor’s presence in&nbsp;the provinces and on the frontiers. The distant
                campaigns&nbsp;of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius, and the unwearying travels&nbsp;of
                Hadrian, were necessary for the safety and good government of the empire, but they
                involved the removal from</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Rome of the real seat of government. The emperors from Vespasian to
                Aurelius were, with the exception of Domitian, ready enough to respect
                constitutional forms, at least&nbsp;in their personal intercourse with the senate,
                and Aurelius&nbsp;seems sincerely to have wished to share with the senate&nbsp;the
                overwhelming responsibilities which pressed upon him.&nbsp;But the improved
                organization of the administrative&nbsp;system which the times demanded was too
                urgent a need&nbsp;to be set aside out of respect for the niceties of an
                obsolete&nbsp;constitutional government; and this period is marked by&nbsp;the
                development and extension of a purely imperial system&nbsp;of government, the
                control of which was centralized in&nbsp;the hands of the emperor alone. The main
                credit of this&nbsp;achievement is due to Hadrian,@@<sup>7</sup> and its immediate
                effect&nbsp;was undoubtedly to increase the effectiveness of the&nbsp;administration
                ; but it accelerated the decay of local independence and energy, and thus diminished
                the strength&nbsp;of the empire. The century which separates the death&nbsp;of
                Marcus Aurelius from the accession of Diocletian&nbsp;(180-284) completed the
                destruction of the old Augustan&nbsp;system. Now and again, as in the case of
                Pertinax, of&nbsp;Severus Alexander, of Maximus and Balbinus, and of&nbsp;Tacitus,
                the senate succeeded in claiming for itself the&nbsp;selection of an emperor, but
                with the single exception of&nbsp;Severus Alexander their nominees were not more
                successful than Nerva in securing the necessary attachment of&nbsp;the legions ; as
                a rule the emperors of the 3d century&nbsp;were more than ever the nominees of the
                soldiery, often&nbsp;men of obscure origin from the frontier
                    provinces.@@<sup>8</sup> The&nbsp;worst of them treated the senate with contempt
                and contumely, and the best of them excluded it from all share&nbsp;in the
                government. Septimius Severus, a native of&nbsp;Africa, set the precedent of
                abstaining from seeking a&nbsp;formal confirmation of his authority from the senate
                    ;@@<sup>9&nbsp;</sup>he assumed the title of proconsul even in Rome,
                administered justice no longer openly in the forum but&nbsp;within the walls of the
                palace, and finally established the&nbsp;prefect of the prætorian guard as the
                officer next in power&nbsp;to the emperor himself. It is, moreover, on his
                inscriptions that the emperor is first officially styled “dominus.”&nbsp;From the
                accession of Decius (249), the first of a series&nbsp;of able emperors sprung from
                the Danubian provinces,&nbsp;the autocratic and military character of the
                imperial&nbsp;system rapidly develops. The old distinctions between&nbsp;imperial
                and senatorial provinces, between the state&nbsp;treasury and the privy purse of the
                emperor, finally disappear. Senators are almost entirely excluded alike
                from&nbsp;the military and civil services. Lender Aurelian (270-275),&nbsp;an able
                soldier and a vigorous administrator, the breach&nbsp;with the old traditions became
                complete. He anticipated&nbsp;Diocletian in the completely autocratic methods of
                his&nbsp;government and in the Oriental pomp and splendour
                w<sup>τ</sup>ith&nbsp;which he surrounded himself.</span></p>

                History of the Empire.—</span><span class="font1">From the development of the

                Diocletian to organize and consolidate we pass to the general fortunes of
                the&nbsp;empire during this period. On the accession of Augustus,&nbsp;there could
                be little doubt as to the nature of the work that&nbsp;was necessary, if peace and
                prosperity were to be secured for&nbsp;the Roman world. He was called upon to
                justify his position by rectifying the frontiers and strengthening the
                frontier&nbsp;defences, by reforming the system of provincial government,&nbsp;and
                by reorganizing the finance; and his success in dealing&nbsp;with these three
                difficult problems is sufficiently proved</span></p>
