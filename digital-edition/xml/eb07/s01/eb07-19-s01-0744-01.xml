                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scotland</hi>, the northern division of Great Britain, is
                    situated between 54° 38' and 58° 41' north latitude, and between 1° 47' and 6°
                    7' west longitude from Greenwich; having the sea on all sides, except the south,
                    where it is separated from England partly by the Tweed and other streams, and
                    partly by a line supposed to be drawn along the high grounds in that quarter.
                    The longest line that can be drawn in about the same parallel of longitude is
                    from the Mull of Galloway in Wigtonshire to Cape Wrath in Sutherland, a distance
                    of about 274 miles, though Dunnet- head in Caithness-shire, is the most
                    northerly point; while its breadth is extremely various, ranging from 147 miles
                    to about 30. The greatest breadth is between Buchanness on the coast of
                    Aberdeenshire, and the Rowanmoan Point on the west coast of Ross-shire. There
                    are other points where the width is not much less; while between Alloa on
                    the</p>
                <p>Frith of Forth and Dunbarton on the Clyde, the distance is only 32 miles, and
                    between Lochbroom and the Frith of Dornoch, it is rather less than 30. The area
                    of Scotland, calculated from Arrowsmith’s map, and as given in the <hi
                        rend="italic">General Survey of Scotland,</hi> contains 25,520 square miles,
                    and 494 square miles of fresh water lakes. This is the extent of the mainland
                    only, exclusive of the islands on the west, known by the name of the Hebrides or
                    Western Isles; and those of Orkney and Zetland on the north, which altogether
                    are computed to extend over 4224 square miles, of which 144 consist of fresh
                    water lakes. Including these islands, the northern limit of Scotland stretches
                    beyond the 61st degree of latitude, and its longitude lies between the meridian
                    of London and 8°18' west ; its area being computed to comprehend 30,238 square
                    miles, of which the fresh water lakes occupy 638 square miles, or about l-48th
                    part of the whole.</p>

                <p>From what has been already said respecting the extreme variation in the breadth
                    of Scotland at different places, the fact may be inferred, that the outline on
                    the sea-coast is exceedingly irregular, and of great extent, the sea penetrating
                    to a great depth, both on its eastern and western sides. Of these arms of the
                    sea, the most considerable are the Firths of Forth and Tay, and the Moray and
                    Dornoch Firths, on the east; and the Firth of Clyde and the Luce and Wigton
                    Bays, on the west and south-west ; whilst there are a very great number of
                    smaller inlets, called lochs, such as Loch Fyne, Loch Long, Loch Etive, Loch
                    Lynnhe, Loch Broom, &amp;c., which indent the country in all directions, to an
                    extent varying from ten to seventy miles. With this irregularity of outline is
                    combined a surface generally rugged and mountainous. With the exception of
                    narrow tracts along its principal rivers, there is very little of the country
                    flat or level, or what would be regarded as productive land in more favoured
                    regions. “ To such a degree,” says Mr. M'Cullocb, “ is this the case, that,
                    estimating the whole extent of the country, exclusive of lakes, at 19,000,000
                    acres, it is doubtful whether so many as 6,000,000 be arable ; whereas, taking
                    the extent of England and Wales at 37,000,000 acres, the arable land certainly
                    exceeds 29,000,000 ; so that, while in Scotland, the proportion of the
                    cultivable to the entire land is less than one-third, in England it exceeds
                    three-fourths. With the exception, indeed, of a few tracts of rich alluvial
                    land, (carses), Scotland has no very extensive vales ; the surface of the rest
                    of the country being, even where most level, considerably varied with hill and
                        dale.”<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                                rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Statistical Account of Great Britain,
                            vol. i. p. 239.</p></note> In the south of Scotland, a tract of
                    mountainous country, known by various names, stretches in a south-west
                    direction, from the Cheviot hills in Roxburghshire, on the borders of England,
                    to the Irish channel, sending off branches on both sides, whilst detached hills
                    prevail over the whole of the contiguous districts. These high grounds, however,
                    are for the most part clothed in green, almost to their summits, and have little
                    of that wild, romantic, and desolate character, which distinguishes many of the
                    mountains of the Highlands. Northward from the isthmus formed by the Firths of
                    Forth and Clyde, the low grounds constitute but a small proportion of the whole.
                    Here, in latitude 57°, the Grampians extend from sea to sea, with a breadth of
                    from forty to sixty miles ; and parallel to them, to the south, is another
                    chain, called the Siedlaw, Ochills, and Campsie hills. Between these two ranges
                    lies the fertile valley of Strathmore ; whilst, farther north, cultivation is
                    mostly confined to the sea-coast, the banks of the larger rivers, and the narrow
                    glens between the mountains. On the north-west, beyond the line of the
                    Caledonian canal, the country is, with few exceptions, singularly rugged and
                    sterile ; consisting of lofty mountains, cither covered with heath, or
                    presenting a mass of naked rocks, interrupted only by deep and dark ravines,
                    lakes, and precipitous streamlets. But the eastern coast of Ross-shire is
                    comparatively level and fertile ; and Caithness, the north-eastern county of the
                    mainland of Scotland, is generally low, marshy, and unproductive.</p>
                <p>Scotland is divided into Highlands and Lowlands. “ Those countries, whose
                    inhabitants speak a different language, and wear a different garb,” says Mr.

                    by northern or southern latitude. The same shire, the same parish, at this day,
                    contains part of both ; so that a Highlander and Lowlander (each of them
                    standing at the door of the cottage where he was born) hear their neighbours
                    speak a language which they do not understand.” The line which separates the
                    Highlands from the Lowlands is by no means well defined ; but it may be
                    described as beginning at Dunbarton, on the Firth of Clyde, and proceeding
                    northward by Crieff, Dunkeld, and Blair</p>
                <p>gowrie, it runs through the forest of Morven, in the heights of Aberdeen, to
                    Carron, in Banffshire; from Carron it stretches due west by Tarnoway, in
                    Morayshire, to the town of Nairn ; from Nairn the line is continued to Inverness
                    ; and from this latter place, it proceeds in a tortuous direction, to Dunistra,
                    on the south side of the Firth of Dornoch, where the line of separation may be
                    said to terminate, the country to the north of this firth being altogether
                    Highland, except a narrow stripe of land along the shores of the German Ocean,
                    which washes the east coast of Sutherland and Caithness. To the west of this
                    line lie the Highlands, which, including the Hebrides, constitute in superficial
                    extent nearly one-half of Scotland, although the inhabitants of this division do
                    not form an eighth part of the population of that kingdom. The face of the
                    country is wild, rugged, desolate, and mountainous. In almost every strath,
                    valley, or glen, there glitters a stream or lake; and numberless firths, or arms
                    of the sea, penetrate the land. The <hi rend="italic">passes</hi> into the
                    Highlands lie in deep ravines or glens, so narrow, and soover- hung by
                    mountains, that they admit of being very easily defended, and till recently,
                    when roads have been made, they were impracticable almost to every one except
                    the natives. To this must principally be ascribed the successful resistance
                    opposed by the Highlanders to the attacks of the Romans and the Saxons ; and
                    hence, also, these northern people still form a distinct race, the lineal
                    descendants of the ancient Celtic inhabitants of the country, and differing
                    essentially in language, dress, and manners, from the Lowlanders..</p>
                <p>The climate of Scotland, as may be expected, from its insular situation and high
                    latitude, is cold, cloudy, and humid. This is its general character, as compared
                    with the greater part of England ; yet, even in the south of England, frost is
                    sometimes more intense, and snow falls more copiously than in Scotland. Corn,
                    however, and most of the fruits and vegetables common to both divisions of Great
                    Britain, attain maturity about three weeks earlier in the south of England than
                    in Scotland ; and some plants, such as hops and a few others, cannot be
                    profitably cultivated at all in the latter country. The mean annual temperature
                    of Scotland is very high for the latitude, being about 46 <hi rend="superscript"
                        > 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ° in places near the level of the
                    sea. In the more southerly parts of the kingdom, the climate differs but little
                    from that of the northern parts of England. Sir David Brewster states the mean
                    annual temperature to be 48 36 at Leith. At Edinburgh, which is elevated from
                    300 to 400 feet above the level of the sea, and situated two miles from it, the
                    annual temperature is 47∙8, and this may be taken as a near approximation to the
                    general average of Scotland ; the mean temperature of winter being 38∙6, of
                    spring, 46∙4, of summer, 58∙2, of autumn, 48∙4, the coldest month being 38∙3,
                    and the warmest 59·4.<note anchored="true" n="3" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                        >New Statistical Account of Scotland,</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,</hi> closely approximate to
                    the above estimate. In the parish of Inch, Wigtonshire, the mean temperature for
                    the year 1837 was 48∙41. At Applegarth Manse, in the interior of Dumfriesshire,
                    the average annual temperature for seven successive years, ending in 1831
                    inclusive, was 47Ί2; that of the spring being 40∙31, of the summer, 56∙86, the
                    autumn, 54∙18, and of winter, 39·92. At Wick in Caithness the mean annual
                    temperature is 46∙7, that of the winter being 40∙35, the spring, 44∙4l, the
                    summer, 5377, and the autumn, 48·82 ; whilst at Sumburgh-head, the most
                    southerly promontory of the Shetland Islands, in latitude 59° 52', the mean
                    annual temperature is 45 ∙5, that of the winter being 40, the spring, 43·29, the
                    summer, 50∙60, and the autumn, 47∙48. The range of the barometer is 2∙82 inches,
                    or from 30·92 to 28· 10 inches; and in the Orkney and Shetland Islands it is
                    somewhat more, or about three inches. The fall of rain is very diffcr-<pb

                    in different districts; but the average is about 31 inches. The quantity which
                    falls on the east coast of Scotland ranges from 22 to 26 inches ; whilst, on the
                    west coast and in the Hebrides, it is nearly double, varying, according to
                    situation, from 35 to 46 inches. The number of fair days throughout the year is,
                    on the west coast, only 160; whilst on the east it is 230. The mean annual fall
                    of rain at Edinburgh for the years 1824 and 1825, was 23 <hi rend="superscript">
                        1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> inches ; at Glasgow, for an average of
                    thirty years, it was 30 inches ; whilst, still farther west, at Mount Stewart,
                    in the Isle ofBute, it was, on an average of seven years, 46∙6 inches, the mean
                    average of the whole country being, as just stated, 31 inches. The prevailing
                    winds throughout Scotland are from the westerly points ; but on the east coast
                    it blows from the easterly points about a third of the year. Easterly winds
                    generally prevail in March and April., and often in May and part of June, and
                    not only check vegetation, but are attended with slightly unfavourable effects
                    on the health of the inhabitants, particularly such of them as are nervous,
                    dyspeptic, consumptive, or rheumatic. But the climate of Scotland is eminently
                    salubrious. There are, properly speaking, no fens or marshes. The low grounds
                    are, in general, highly cultivated. From whatever point the wind may blow,
                    except the east, a wide expanse of sea is passed ever ; and the air, though
                    moist, is purified from injurious emanations, which are readily absorbed by the
                    ocean. Hence it has been affirmed, that the mean duration of life is greater in
                    Scotland than in almost any other country.<note anchored="true" n="4"

                    reaches seventy or eighty years of age, and the vigour then remaining, are
                    greater in Scotland than almost any where else.”</p>
                <p>The mountains of Scotland consist either of detached groups, more or less closely
                    wedged together, or of ridges or chains. These latter may be characterized as
                    running in a north-east and south-west direction. The most celebrated chain, the
                    Grampians, mentioned by Tacitus,<note anchored="true" n="5" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>Agricolæ Vita, c. 29.</p></note> extend from the
                    south-eastern boundaries of Argyleshire, with a more or less defined line, to
                    the heart of Aberdeenshire. This chain may be regarded as a natural rampart,
                    forming the south-eastern boundary of the Highlands. With the exception of Ben
                    Nevis, the highest mountains in Scotland arc comprehended in the Grampian range.
                    Another chain, to the south of the Grampians, and nearly parallel to them,
                    stretches from Montrose to the Clyde, in Dunbartonshire ; but being intersected
                    by the Tay and the Forth, it is divided into three distinct portions, which bear
                    different names. From Montrose to the Tay, this chain is called the Siedlaw
                    hills ; from the Tay to the Forth, it is known by the name of the Ochills; and
                    the remainder passes under the names of the Dundaff, Fintry, and Campsie hills.
                    The low- country, or strath, which separates this range of hills from the
                    Grampians, is called Strathmore, or the great valley. There is also a chain of
                    mountains in the south of Scotland, stretching from the Cheviot hills, on the
                    borders of Northumberland, to Loch Ryan, in Wigtonshire. There are other smaller
                    ranges, such as the Monagh Lea mountains, which run parallel to and along the
                    western side of the Spey; the Lomond hills in Fifeshire ; the Pentland hills in
                    Mid-Lothian, and others. The altitude and situation of the principal hills and
                    mountains in Scotland having already been given under the head of Physical
                    Geography, it is unnecessary to repeat the information here.</p>
                <p>In the neighbourhood of the village of Leadhills, in Lanarkshire, 1564 feet above
                    the level of the sea, is the highest cultivated land in Scotland. In
                    Aberdeenshire, the plough sometimes reaches the height of about 1300 feet; but,
                    with few exceptions, an elevation of 600 feet seems</p>
                <p>to be the limit of the tillage lands of Scotland. None of the Scottish mountains
                    ascends to the line of perpetual congelation ; yet snow may be found all the
                    year round in some of the dark recesses, on which the sun never shines.</p>
                <p>From the rugged and mountainous character of the surface of Scotland, the vales
                    or level tracts cannot be expected to be extensive or numerous. They are,
                    indeed, when compared with England, very much the reverse. Of these vales,
                    called sometimes <hi rend="italic">straths</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >carses,</hi> the following are the most important The vale or <hi
                        rend="italic">carse</hi> of Stirling and Falkirk is a tract of low alluvial
                    land, which extends on both sides of the Forth, with little interruption, and to
                    a greater or less width, from Borrowstonness to about twenty miles north of
                    Stirling, including the vales of the Teith and the Allan, two tributaries of the
                    Forth. These lands are peculiarly fertile, and produce the richest crops of
                    wheat and other grain. The vale of the Earn, a tributary of the Tay, known by
                    the name of Strathearn, is of a similar character, but of comparatively limited
                    extent. The carse of Gowrie, which lies on the north of the Tay, from Dundee to
                    Perth, is incomparably the most fertile and productive district in Scotland, and
                    is thought not to be surpassed in these respects by any other district of equal
                    extent in the united kingdom. Strathmore stretches from Lawrencekirk in
                    Angusshire to the neighbourhood of Perth, lying between the bases of the Siedlaw
                    hills and the Grampians. This valley is not entirely flat, but is characterised
                    by occasional gentle eminences. The <hi rend="italic">Merse,</hi> or level lands
                    of Berwick shire, stretch from the confluence of the Leader and the Tweed to the
                    town of Berwick, occupying most of the low and generally level part of the
                    country, or nearly the half of its surface. The carse of Baldoon, lying south of
                    the river Bladenoch, and on the east shore of the bay of Wigton, is of limited
                    extent, but of nearly equal fertility to the carse of Gowrie. There are other
                    less important straths or carses, such as those along the Teviot in
                    Roxburghshire ; Tynedale, or the vale of Tyne, in East Lothian ; and the Howe,
                    or vale of Eden, in Fifeshire. These lands are either loamy or alluvial.</p>
                <p>By this term we mean tracts of land composed of morasses, intermixed with rocks,
                    lakes, and peat-moss. The moor of Rannoch, lying between Schehallion, Ben Cru-
                    achan, and Ben Nevis, is one of the most lonely, wild, and dreary districts in
                    Scotland. It may be said to be entirely devoid of value, and would not of itself
                    bring any rent. It is not inhabited, and very seldom visited. There is a tract
                    about ten miles inland on the west coast of Sutherlandshire, not very
                    dissimilar, but, though more rugged, it is not quite so dreary as that of the
                    moor of Rannoch. The <hi rend="italic">flow</hi> of Glenluce lies between
                    Newtonstewart and Luce Bay, stretching along the public road for about ten
                    miles, composed chiefly of peat and morasses, and forming one of the bleakest
                    and most dreary rides in Scotland.</p>
                <p>From the rugged and mountainous nature of the country, the rivers of Scotland are
                    characterised by a more rapid course, are more diversified by rocks and
                    cataracts, and are more limpid than those of England. Their course is also
                    necessarily shorter, and few of them are navigable, at least to any great
                    extent. Being generally mountain streams, they are peculiarly liable to sudden
                    overflowings, their rise and fall being equally sudden. From a very tedious and
                    elaborate set of experiments, it is computed that they carry out to the sea, on
                    an average, about <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                        2000</hi> the weight of their waters in mud ; that is, a film of about <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 50</hi> of an inch
                    annually, or one inch in fifty years over the whole surface from which they draw
                    their waters.</p>
                <p>The principal rivers of Scotland, with the single exception of the Clyde, are
                    exclusively confined to the east. Three inconsiderable rivers flow in a
                    south-easterly direction, the<pb facs="chi.28490931-1526160593_Page_812.jpf"

                    miles south of Kirkcudbright, and is navigable for small vessels two miles above
                    that town ; the Nith, which rises in the north of Dumfries-shire, and falls into
                    the Solway Firth more than seven miles below Dumfries, being navigable to within
                    two miles of that place ; and the Annan, which rises on the south side of
                    Hartfell, near Moffat, and falls into the same estuary at the town of Annan. The
                    last is not navigable beyond this burgh. The rivers which flow in a northerly or
                    north-easterly direction are the Ness, which flows from Loch Ness, and, after a
                    short course, falls into the Moray Firth near Inverness ; the Findhorn, which,
                    rising in the Monagh Lea mountains, falls into the same estuary at Findhorn,
                    after a winding course of upwards of 50 miles; and the Spey, the most rapid of
                    the Scottish rivers, which flows from Loch Spey towards the west of
                    Inverness-shire, and, after receiving innumerable tributaries, and traversing
                    the best wooded portion of the Highlands, falls into the Moray Firth. The course
                    of the Spey is nearly 100 miles ; it drains above 1300 square miles of country,
                    but is not navigable. With the exception of the Ayr, which is likewise not
                    navigable, and falls into the sea at the town of the same name, the only river
                    on the west coast worth mentioning, is the Clyde, (the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Glotta</hi> of Tacitus), which, in a manufacturing and commercial point of
                    view, is the most important stream in Scotland. It rises on the west of the
                    Moffat mountains, and, after a circuitous course of nearly eighty miles, falls
                    into the Firth of Clyde below Dunbarton. It receives various tributaries, and is
                    navigable to Glasgow, passing in its course the principal manufacturing and
                    commercial towns in Scotland; Glasgow, Hamilton, Lanark, Paisley, Port-Glasgow,
                    and Greenock. The navigation of the Clyde was formerly much obstructed ; but
                    under the management of a Parliamentary board, called the River Trust, these
                    obstructions have been nearly removed, and the channel rendered so deep and
                    straight that vessels of 400 tons can now resort to the Broomielaw at Glasgow.
                    The falls of Clyde, which are about 30 miles south-east of Glasgow, are very
                    striking and celebrated. The first considerable fall is that of Bonnington, its
                    height, including that of a little one immediately above it, being about thirty
                    feet. The second is Corra Linn, where the water dashes from one shelving rock to
                    another, its perpendicular height being about seventy feet. Dundaff fall is only
                    ten feet in height ; whilst that of Stonebyres, which includes three distinct
                    falls, is not less than seventy-six feet.<note anchored="true" n="6"

                    the Tweed, the Forth, the Tay, the North and South Esk, the Dee, and the Don.
                    The Tweed rises near the sources of the Annan and Clyde, and running past
                    Peebles through a beautiful pastoral country, falls into the German ocean at
                    Berwick-upon-Tweed, after a winding course of about a hundred miles. The descent
                    from its source to its embouchure is about 1500 feet ; and it is navigable only
                    to Berwick. The Forth, (the <hi rend="italic">Bodotria</hi> of Tacitus), rises
                    on the east of Ben Lomond, and receiving the waters of the Teith and the Allan,
                    it becomes a considerable stream at Stirling, to which the tide flows, and to
                    which it is navigable for vessels of about seventy tons. From Stirling to Alloa
                    is only six miles by land, but the stream of the Forth is so tortuous that it is
                    no less than sixteen by water. The river may here be said to terminate in the
                    Firth, which extends to the German ocean, a distance of forty miles. Its width
                    is various. At Queensferry, eight miles west of Edinburgh, it is two miles ; at
                    Leith it is six ; and thence it gradually expands till it is lost in the open
                    sea. It is navigable for vessels of 300 tons as far as Alloa. The only low water
                    pier of which it can boast is that of Granton, about a mile and a half west of
                    Leith. The Tay rises to the north of Loch Lomond, and expanding into the
                    romantic</p>
                <p>sheet of water called Loch Tay, it flows in a circuitous route past Dunkeld and
                    Perth, and falls into the Firth of Tay at the confluence of its waters with the
                    Earn, about twenty miles from the mouth of the estuary. It is navigable to
                    Dundee for vessels of 500 tons burthen, and to Perth for those of 100 tons. It
                    receives many tributaries, of which the Earn, just mentioned, is the most
                    important. The Tay is the largest of the Scottish, and, in respect to the volume
                    of water it conveys to the sea, even of the British rivers. The North and South
                    Esk have their source in the Grampians, and fall into the sea at Montrose,
                    within three miles of each other. The South Esk is navigable to Montrose, about
                    a mile and a half from its mouth. The North Esk is not navigable. The basin of
                    Montrose, through which the South Esk flows, and which bounds the town on the
                    west, comprehends about 2000 acres of land; it is covered by water at full sea,
                    and exhibits nothing but bare sand at ebb tide. This expanse, it has been
                    calculated, might be reclaimed at a gross cost of L.11,938.<note anchored="true"

                    Don have also their rise in the Grampians, and fall into the sea, the former at
                    New Aberdeen, and the latter at Old Aberdeen. The Dee is navigable for about a
                    mile from its mouth ; the Don is not navigable.</p>
                <p>The Scottish rivers, as stated at the beginning of this head, are of such a
                    character, that there is no room for reclaiming waste land from their channels.
                    This is prevented by the rapidity of their streams and by their rugged course.
                    But several attempts have been made to reclaim lands from innundation on the
                    shores of the Firths of Forth and Tay. Without entering into particulars the
                    following results may be given:<note anchored="true" n="8" place="bottom"

                <p>In addition to this, it has been stated that the extent of land now in process of
                    being reclaimed, on different estates on the shores of the Tay, may be computed
                    at 1140 acres, at a gross cost of L.50 per acre. The following extract, on the
                    subject of embankments, from a work just published,<note anchored="true" n="9"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>New Statistical Account of Scotland, part
                            xxiii. p. 631.</p></note> contains minute and interesting information ;
                    “ About 68 Scots acres of land have been here, (the parish of St. Madoes,) at
                    different times reclaimed from the Tay by embankments. In 1826, in consequence
                    of an arrangement between Sir John Richardson, the proprietor, and Mr. R.W.
                    Rannie, tenant, Pitfour Mains, by which the latter agreed to raise an embankment
                    at his own expense, and after being allowed to take the first crop free, to pay
                    L.4, 10s. annually, per Scots acre, for the reclaimed land, during a lease of
                    nineteen years ; operations were commenced, which resulted in the complete
                    reclamation of 50 acres during the autumn of that year. The whole expense of
                    embankments, sluices, levelling, water cuts, and trenching amounted to L.1530.
                    So productive, however, did the new soil turn out, that Mr. Rannie has been
                    amply rewarded for his enterprise. According to his own account, he has had,
                    before liming and manuring, on some parts of a field, about 60 bolls of potatoes
                    per acre, the average produce being from 40 to 50 bolls. After liming and
                    manuring, he has had, on some parts of a field, 70 bolls per acre, the average
                    being from 50 to 60 bolls, of 32 stones Dutch to<pb
                        facs="chi.28490931-1526160593_Page_813.jpf" xml:id="eb07-19-s01-0748"/> the
                    boll. He has had of oats, before liming and manuring, from 10 to 11, after
                    liming and manuring, from 12 to 13 quarters per acre ; and of wheat from 6 to 7
                    quarters per acre. He commenced liming in 1829 and manuring in 1835, the
                    rotation, up to that period, being potatoes, and wheat, or oats, alternately. In
                    1833, Sir John Richardson reclaimed 18 acres more at an expense of L.1200; and,
                    by means of head-dikes, break-waters, and other contrivances, which he is from
                    time to time throwing out into the river, for the purpose of accommodating silt,
                    upwards of 150 acres more may ultimately be added to the parish ; of these, from
                    15 to 20 may be banked off in the course of two years.”</p>
                <p>From a table already given, under the head of Superficial Extent, we have already
                    found that the fresh water lakes in Scotland occupy an area of 638 square miles,
                    or cover an aggregate extent of 408,320 English statute acres. The only counties
                    that are devoid of lakes are those of Berwick, Clackmannan, the Lothians, and
                    Peebles ; whilst those of Roxburgh amount to only 320 English acres. The
                    greatest extent of lakes are in Inverness-shire, (84,480 English acres,)
                    Argyleshire, exclusive of islands, (38,400,) Ross- shire, (38,400,) Perthshire,
                    (32,000,) and Sutherlandshire, (30,080.) The lakes, generally speaking, occupy
                    the valleys or ravines amongst the mountains, and are thus distinguished for
                    their length, their breadth being comparatively trifling. The only Lowland lakes
                    worth specifying are Loch Leven, St. Mary’s Loch, and Loch Ken. The first,
                    situated in Kinross-shire, is four miles in length by two in breadth, having the
                    Lomond hills on its east, and Benarty hill on its south ; whilst the towns of
                    Kinross and Milnathort lie on its western margin. This lake is remarkable for a
                    peculiar species of red trout, which is highly valued;<note anchored="true"
                        n="10" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Statistical Account of
                            Scotland.</p></note> * and it also produces char, perch, pike, and other
                    species of fish. The fishery is let for a considerable sum ; and it is a
                    remarkable fact that Loch Leven is the only Scottish lake that yields any
                    revenue to its proprietors. There is not even an attempt made to derive any
                    profits from any other lake ; nay, they are not fished for the domestic
                    consumption even of the neighbouring inhabitants. But Loch Leven is principally
                    celebrated for an island in the lake in which are the picturesque ruins of a
                    castle, where Queen Mary was confined by her subjects, and from which she
                    effected her escape (1568) a few days previous to the fatal battle of Langside.
                    There are other small islands in the lake, the principal of which is St. Serf’s,
                    where was once a famous monastery, of which Andrew Winton, author of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Chronykil of Scotland,</hi> was prior. St. Mary’s Loch, a most
                    beautiful and picturesque sheet of water, three miles in length by from half a
                    mile to a mile in breadth, is in Selkirkshire. Loch Ken is formed by the
                    expansion of the river Ken in Kirkcudbrightshire, and forms part of the river.
                    It is ten miles in length by rather less than a mile in breadth. The other lakes
                    are all north of the Firths of Clyde and Forth. Loch Lomond is the most
                    celebrated as well as the largest lake in Scotland ; indeed, it is the largest
                    in the British dominions. This noble sheet of water is above twenty-four miles
                    in length, its greatest breadth is ten miles, but, towards its upper part, it is
                    not more than half a mile. Its depth varies from twenty to a hundred and twenty
                    fathoms, and its greatest depth is towards the north. It is studded with
                    numerous and richly wooded islands, some of them being very small, but the
                    largest, Inchmurrin, is two miles in length and one in breadth. Some of them,
                    particularly Inchmurrin, are stocked with deer. Both sides of the lake are
                    flanked by high and rugged mountains, among which “ the lofty Ben Lomond” stands
                    conspicuous, its height being 3195 feet above the margin of the water. The
                    surface water of Loch Lomond is from three to five feet higher in winter than in
                    summer ; but its mean height is about twenty-two feet above the level of the sea
                    at Dunbarton. Its surplus water is convey</p>
                <p>ed to the Clyde, a distance of six miles, by the river Leven. Loch Katterin, so
                    celebrated in Sir Walter Scott’s <hi rend="italic">Lady of the Lake,</hi> lies
                    in the district of Menteith, Perthshire, and is one of the most romantic in
                    Scotland. Its length is eight miles, and its greatest breadth less than one. It
                    does not seem necessary to give a minute description of the other lakes; but the

                <p>In a general point of view, Scotland may be separated, geologically as well as
                    geographically, into three portions. By passing a line on the map nearly
                    straight from Stonehaven, through Dunkeld, to the middle of the Isle of Bute,
                    and thence with a slight curve to the Mull of Cantyre, we shall have traced the
                    southern boundary of the primary nonfossiliferous system of rocks. Another line,
                    but much more irregular than the former, drawn from St. Abb’s Head in
                    Berwickshire, passing near Peebles, Sanquhar, and New Cumnock, to the south of
                    Girvan on the western coast, will form a general parallelism with the former
                    line, and will contain the old greywacke, now named the Cumbrian system, lying
                    to the south, and extending to the boundary between England and Scotland, whilst
                    the land included between the two lines comprehends the old red sandstone, and
                    great central basin of Scotland.</p>
                <p>That extensive tract of Scotland which constitutes the northern division, is
                    composed chiefly of gneiss, mica slate, chlorite slate, and clay slate, with
                    subordinate masses of hornblende slate, talc slate, and primitive limestone.
                    These, with granitic centres, often rise into magnificent mountains, of which
                    the Grampians form a part. In many of these deposits, particularly in the mica
                    slate, garnets of a brown colour are very abundant. In the primary deposits no
                    organic remains have ever been discovered.</p>
                <p>These, however, are not the only stratified formations which constitute this
                    extensive district. The old red sandstone fringes the extremities of the land,
                    commencing near the<pb facs="chi.28490931-1526160593_Page_814.jpf"
                        xml:id="eb07-19-s01-0749"/> Moray Firth, extending on both sides of Loch
                    Ness till within a short distance of Fort Augustus, and then proceeding
                    northward, expanding the whole breadth of Caithness, and constituting the
                    principal formation of the Orkney Isles. On the western site of the mainland,
                    the old red sandstone is deposited in numerous patches on the gneiss formation,
                    as at Loch Broom, Gairloch, and Applecross.</p>
                <p>The new secondary rocks have been but sparingly observed in Scotland ; yet it is
                    a curious fact that the few patches that have been discovered are superimposed
                    on the old red sandstone, and have not been reposing in uninterrupted order in
                    the secondary series. Thus the lias shales, highly micaceous, and some of the
                    upper beds of the oolitic system, occur at the mouth of the Cromarty Firth, from
                    Dunrobin Castle to the ord of Caithness, Applecross, and other points on the
                    mainland, and in the Western Islands, on the borders of Mull, the south and east
                    of Skye, and near to the rocks of Arran. The equivalent of the fresh water
                    deposits of the wealds of Sussex, geologically situated above the oolitic group
                    and below the chalk, is seen in Moray and Skye. In the central and southern
                    divisions of Scotland, these newer groups of rocks have not been detected. In
                    this division of Scotland very few metallic ores have been found. Lead mines
                    were formerly wrought at Tyn- drum, to the west of Loch Tay. Lead mines are at
                    present wrought at Stronbean in Argyleshire, at which place the carbonate of
                    strontian was first discovered. At Glen Strath- fairer, in Inverness-shire,
                    there have been detected veins of plumbago running between the laminæ of the
                    mica slate.</p>
                <p>We may here briefly refer to the geological character of the Western Isles. Dr.

                    lying in a south-west and north-east direction, the gneiss island, from the
                    predominance of that species of rock. Another group, embracing Skye, Rum, Canna,
                    Mack, Egg, and Mull, he denominates the trap islands. There are five basaltic
                    islands off the north-west side of Mull, of which the smallest but the most
                    celebrated is Staffa, which is well known for its basaltic columns and cavern,
                    called Fingal’s cave. This cave, one of the most remarkable natural excavations
                    in the world, is formed of the columnar bed of basalt, where it declines to the
                    level of the sea, which washes the feet of the columns, that are like the
                    pillars of an immense cathedral, placed close to each other, the sea forming the
                    floor. The top of the arch, at the entrance, is 66 feet ; but it gradually
                    declines to 40 at the extremity, at the distance of 227 feet. The breadth of the
                    cave is about forty feet. There are other similar caverns of less note on the
                    island. The basalt of which the columns in Staffa are composed, is similar to
                    that of the Giant’s Causeway in Ireland ; and it is probable that they are both
                    of submarine origin, having been raised by the sea. St. Kilda,the most western
                    of the Hebrides, is composed of several varieties of the trap rock. Arran, in
                    the Firth of Clyde, even to the top of the highest mountains, is principally
                    granitic.</p>
                <p>In tracing the geological features of the country in the ascending order of the
                    groups, we come next to the transition or greywacke system, now divided into two
                    principal sections, the lower or Cumbrian, and the upper or Silurian. As far as
                    has hitherto been ascertained, the Silurian division is unknown in Scotland ;
                    and the Cumbrian rocks, destitute of organic remains, cover the greater part of
                    the area of the south of Scotland. These greywacke strata stand at high angles
                    of from sixty to ninety degrees, and consist chiefly of coarse slatystrata,
                    seldom divisible into thin roofing slates, and often alternating with arenaceous
                    and coarse conglomerates. Amongst them, limestone is seldom found, and, when it
                    is, the quality of it is inferior. In the division of which we now treat, coal
                    and its accompaniments are known</p>
                <p>in few places ; it is, however, wrought at Canonby, near Langholm, and at the
                    Carter Fell. The only other rock formation, found in connexion with the old
                    transition group here, with the exception of igneous rocks, is a red sandstone,
                    ascertained, in some situations, to be the old red, but in others, considered as
                    the new red sandstone, particularly in Dumfries-shire.</p>
                <p>In the third geological division of Scotland, namely, the centre of the kingdom,
                    is placed the great coal basin ; but, adhering to our rule of marking the
                    successive formations in the ascending order, we shall first treat of the old
                    red sandstone, the most ancient rock in this subdivision of the country. This
                    rock abuts against the line of the primary rocks, and stretches across the whole
                    country from the German Ocean to the Atlantic, pursuing, like the mountain
                    ranges, a south-westerly, or north-easterly direction. Its line forms a long,
                    uninterrupted, extensive, and fertile valley. In the north-western part, it
                    rises into hills, on the sides of one of which, east of Menteith, are deep and
                    hideous fissures, the effect of some convulsion of the earth.</p>
                <p>The formation appears to be of vast thickness, especially towards the north, and
                    may, it is supposed, be divided into three portions ; the lower, the middle, and
                    the upper beds. In what are considered as the lower strata, the remains of
                    fishes have been found in a high state of preservation. The well known Arbroath
                    pavement belongs to the old red sandstone series.</p>
                <p>But the most important group in this central district is the coal formation,
                    consisting of limestone, ironstone, freestone, coal, and clays. The extent from
                    east to west is bounded only by the extremities of the land. To the north, it is
                    cut off from the old red sandstone by a range of trap hills, crossing the
                    country from east to west. On the south, it is bounded by the greywacke and the
                    old red sandstone. Its breadth, extending on both sides of the Forth and Clyde,
                    averages forty miles, and its length about seventy miles.</p>
                <p>The mountain limestone forms generally the basis of the group, although it is
                    frequently found interstratified with other members of the series, and abounds
                    with great numbers of organic remains. Below the mountain limestone, however,
                    but belonging to the same group, a bed of limestone is worked at Burdie-house,
                    near Edinburgh, in which the organic remains differ essentially from those which
                    have been just named. These remains consist of many of the plants which
                    distinguish the coal formation ; but that alluded to includes also the teeth,
                    scales, and other bones of fishes which partake of the reptile character, some
                    of which must have been of gigantic dimensions. Small fishes are also found in a
                    fine state of preservation. The same limestone has been found in other parts of
                    the country, and is of superior quality to the common limestone, for mortar,
                    plaster, and the smelting of iron.</p>
                <p>The clay limestone is found in beds and nodules, the workable kind containing
                    from twenty-seven to forty-five per cent. of iron. The kind termed black band is
                    in high request. From this ore is smelted vast quantities of pig iron. The iron
                    works in Scotland have been increasing beyond all example ; at Carron,
                    Gartsherrie, Shotts, Cleland, Airdrie, Clyde, and other places. The quantity of
                    iron produced in Scotland in 1830 amounted to 37,500 tons. But tour years
                    afterwards, in 1834, the latest date of which we have any correct accounst, the
                    quantity had nearly doubled, being about 72,000 tons. These works are generally
                    within ten or a dozen miles of Glasgow.</p>
                <p>The coal is found in beds varying from a few inches to forty feet in thickness,
                    is extracted in great quantity, and is used as fuel, both for domestic and
                    manufacturing purposes. One variety, cannel coal, is of superior quality for<pb

                    preparation of gas. From the fire clay are manufactured fire brick and gas
                    retorts ; and the sandstone furnishes an inexhaustible store of substantial and
                    beautiful material for building.</p>
                <p>These several deposits contain in abundance the impressions of the vegetables
                    which distinguish the carboniferous period ; and, what is remarkable, the
                    remains of animals, the same as occur in the Burdie-house limestone, are found
                    in the shales, and even in the coal itself. In the island, no strata newer than
                    the carboniferous system is known to exist. All is covered over with
                    accumulations of clay, gravel, sand, and soil.</p>
                <p>Until after the middle of last century’ there was scarcely a good road in
                    Scotland. Soon after the rebellion of 1715, Government began to open up the
                    country by roads made by the military, hence called military roads, which
                    extended in all about eight hundred miles ; but these being confined for the
                    most part to the Highlands, intended for military purposes, and formed with
                    little or no regard to such ascents and descents as do not impede the passage of
                    an army, were of little advantage in an economical point of view. It is in the
                    recollection of persons still living, when corn, coals, and other heavy
                    articles, were usually carried upon the backs of horses, even in the southern
                    counties of Scotland; the roads, or rather the tracks, being for the greater
                    part of the year unfit for wheel-carriages. But so great a change has been made
                    in this respect, particularly within the last forty years, that mail-coaches,
                    and other carriages, now run day and night at the rate of from eight to ten
                    miles an hour through every part of the country, from the borders of England to
                    the northern extremity of Great Britain.</p>
                <p>The only funds formerly applicable to the making and the repairing of the roads
                    in Scotland were what is called the Statute Labour, or the labour of the
                    occupiers of the land, for six days annually, upon the roads passing through
                    their respective parishes, and a small assessment imposed upon the proprietors.
                    This labbur, which has been converted into payment in money, and also the sums
                    raised by assessment on the proprietors, under the name of road and bridge
                    money, are now applied to bye-roads, or such as communicate with the great
                    turnpikes. Almost every county has procured an act of Parliament which fixes the
                    rate of these assessments; but this varies in different counties according to
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>The turnpike roads and bridges in the Lowlands have, for nearly a century, been
                    made, and are kept in repair by means of tolls exacted from those who use them,
                    under the authority of private acts of Parliament. The first of these acts was
                    obtained in 1750, at which time the roads were so bad that the journey from
                    Edinburgh to Glasgow, a distance of forty-two miles, occupied 1 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> days, whereas it
                    is now effected in from 4 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                        2</hi> to 5 hours. The trustees named in these acts are commonly empowered,
                    whether wisely or not, to borrow money upon the security of the funds to be
                    received ; by which means the work is more speedily executed. The board of
                    trustees consists of the sheriff-depute, his substitute, and the justices of the
                    peace in the county, together with all individuals, and their eldest sons, who
                    are owners of estates worth L.100 Scotch a-year, and upwards, of valued rent.
                    The result of this is, that “ in consequence of the excellent materials which
                    abound in all parts of Scotland, and of the greater skill and science of Scotch
                    trustees and surveyors, the turnpike roads in Scotland are superior to those in
                        England.”<note anchored="true" n="12" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    not admit of the same system as in the Lowlands. The military roads had not only
                    been</p>
                <p>made, but were kept in repair at the public expense, for which L.5000 a-year was
                    usually granted by Parliament; but a great many new roads and bridges were
                    required; and, in 1803, an act was passed, proceeding upon “ a survey and report
                    of the coasts and central Highlands of Scotland,” by which Parliament agreed to
                    provide half the estimated expense of the necessary roads and bridges, the other
                    half to be defrayed by the landed proprietors; and Commissioners were named to
                    carry into effect the beneficent intentions of the Legislature. It appears from
                    the report just referred to, that, under this act, the Commissioners had, in
                    1821, expended, on 875 miles of road, and several large bridges, upwards of
                    L.450,000, of which L.240,000 was granted by Parliament, and the rest defrayed
                    by the counties through which the roads passed; and that L.100,000 more had been
                    laid out by them upon harbours, of which L.50,000 was paid out of the funds
                    arising from the forfeited estates in Scotland, and the remainder raised by the
                    burghs, and by the contributions of individuals. If, to these sums, we add the
                    amount of the losses sustained by the contractors, as stated in the Report, and
                    the expense of the new roads made at the sole cost of the proprietors, to
                    communicate with the Parliamentary roads, together with the charges of repairs,
                    the whole amount expended within these twenty years upon the roads, bridges, and
                    harbours of the Highlands of Scotland, may not be too highly stated at a million
                    sterling. The Commissioners have under their charge both the maintaining of
                    their own roads, and part of the military roads, the extent of the whole in 1821
                    being 1183 miles; and about L.10,000 a-year, of which L.5000 is granted by
                    Parliament, was considered to be necessary for this purpose, including all
                    charges of management.<note anchored="true" n="13" place="bottom"

                    locks. The depth in some places is only seventeen feet, but it was originally

                    of 1000 tons can pass through it. It is 50 feet wide at the bottom, and 122 at
                    top. But with all its magnificence, it has been found to be an improvident
                    speculation. The total cost of the canal, up to 1822, when it was opened, was
                    L.905,258; and the aggregate outlay to the first of May 1839, was no less than
                    L.1,023,628. Besides, the Commissioners have incurred a debt, including cash
                    advanced by the bank, and outstanding claims, of L.39,146. Nor has the income
                    ever met the expenditure. In the year ending on the first of May 1839, for
                    example, the expenditure was L.4170, whereas the income, though above the
                    average, was only L.2532. It has, therefore, become a question with government
                    whether the undertaking should be maintained or abandoned. The Lords of the

                    presented to the House of Commons in 1838; and a select Committee was appointed
                    to take the whole subject into consideration. The result of their investigations
                    was, a recommendation that steam tugs should be employed in the locks, so as to
                    ensure a speedy navigation, and that a sum not exceeding L.200,000 be placed at
                    the disposal of the government, to be expended in the repair and improvement of
                    the canal, under the authority of an act of Parliament, which should be procured

                    round the Mull of Cantyre. It was originally undertaken in 1793 by subscription
                    of share-holders; but the sum subscribed(L.108,000) being quite insufficient for
                    the completion of the work, the government advanced the money, and the canal was
                    transferred on mortgage to the Barons of Exchequer in Scotland. The management
                    has since 1817 been lodged in the hands of the Commissioners of the Caledonian
                    Canal. It is nine miles long, and twelve feet deep, admitting vessels of 200
                    tons burden. The income scarcely covers the expenditure.<note anchored="true"

                    joins the Forth and Clyde Canal at Port-Downie, near Falkirk, a distance of 31
                        <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> miles. Its
                    depth is only five feet, so that its traffic is quite limited. The Monkland
                    Canal stretches from Glasgow to Woodhall, about two miles south-east of Airdrie,
                    a distance of twelve miles, and communicates by a lateral branch with the Forth
                    and Clyde Canal at Port-Dundas. The Glasgow, Paisley, and Ardrossan Canal has
                    not been completed ; indeed it is not now intended to complete it. The progress
                    of railways seems partially to supersede the use of canal communication. The
                    canal in question has been constructed from Port-Eglinton, near Glasgow, to the
                    village of Johnstone, a distance of eleven miles, and was opened in 1811. It was
                    on this canal that the experiment was made in rapid travelling by canals,
                    demonstrating that it was practicable for a properly constructed boat, carrying
                    passengers and goods along a canal, to go at a rate of nine or ten miles an
                    hour, without injury to the banks. These light boats are now common on canals
                    suited for such travelling. The Aberdeenshire Canal, completed in 1807,
                    stretches from the harbour of Aberdeen to Inventury. The length is 18 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> miles, and the
                    number of locks is seventeen.</p>
                <p>The first act obtained, in 1808, for a railway in Scotland, was for that between
                    Kilmarnock and Troon, a distance of 9 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> miles. The Monkland and Kirkintilloch railway
                    connects the rich coal and ironstone district of New and Old Monkland, and,
                    within fourteen miles of the city of Glasgow, with the Forth and Clyde Canal,
                    near Kirkintilloch. The Ballochney railway, which has been in operation for
                    about ten years, is merely an elongation of the last mentioned line, four miles
                    eastward into the interior. The Glasgow and Garnkirk railway stretches eight
                    miles west from Glasgow, till it communicates with the Monkland and
                    Kirkintilloch line, forming a direct communication with Glasgow, and
                    avoiding</p>
                <p>the circuitous route of that line. The Wishaw and Coltness railway, which is
                    meant to connect the Monkland and Kirkintilloch branch with the rich coal and
                    ironstone beds of Wishaw, Coltness, and Allanton, has not yet been completed,
                    though the act was passed in 1829. The Slamannan railway, which is in progress
                    of construction, is to extend from the eastern termination of the Ballochney
                    line to the Union Canal, within a mile of Linlithgow, a distance of 12 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> miles. An act has
                    been passed (1837) for forming a branch to the town of Bathgate. The Pollock and
                    Govan railway, which was meant to connect these two places, which lye on the
                    south of Glasgow, with that city, an interval of three miles, is in the same
                    unfinished state. The Paisley and Renfrew railway, which extends from Paisley to
                    the river Clyde at Renfrew ferry, a distance of 3 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> miles, was opened in 1837. The Glasgow, Paisley,
                    and Greenock railway is meant to connect Glasgow and Greenock by way of Paisley.
                    It runs nearly parallel with the Clyde, and is meant to be completed in 1840.
                    The Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock, and Ayr railway is intended to connect these
                    towns and the adjacent districts. The line from Glasgow to Paisley is declared
                    to be common to the latter line, and that of the Glasgow, Paisley, and Greenock
                    railway, and to be executed at the joint expense of both companies. The Glasgow
                    and Paisley railway is to send branches out to the different towns in the
                    district through which it passes. An act was obtained in 1838 for constructing a
                    railway between Edinburgh and Glasgow. The line is to run nearly on a parallel
                    with the Union Canal, past Ratho, Winchburgh, Linlithgow, and Falkirk, to pass
                    that canal near Port-Downie, and to proceed onward to Glasgow by a line nearly
                    parallel to the Great Canal. The distance will be forty-six miles. The capital
                    of the company is L.900,000. Twenty-nine miles of the line have already been
                    contracted for, and the work will be completed at farthest in 1842. The
                    Edinburgh and Dalkeith railway was opened in 1832. It extends to Dalhousie Mains
                    on the South Esk, but a private branch has been carried over that river by a
                    viaduct, and extends southwards for upwards of a mile. The Dalkeith line is
                    about to be carried over the North Esk, in order to connect extensive coal
                    fields in that quarter with the city of Edinburgh. There are also branches to
                    Leith and Fisherrow. On this railway upwards of 100,000 tons of goods, and
                    300,000 passengers are annually conveyed. The Edinburgh, Leith, and Newhaven
                    railway is only meant to extend 2 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> miles. It is to commence at Canal Street, at the
                    cast end of Princes Street gardens, and proceed by a tunnel of 2800 feet, or
                    rather more than a fifth of the whole line, under St. Andrews Street, St.
                    Andrews Square, Duke Street, Drummond Place, &amp;c. to the foot of Scotland
                    Street, and thence to Newhaven in nearly a straight line, with a branch along
                    the north side of the Water of Leith, to the wet docks at Leith. The work has
                    been begun, but when it will be completed is uncertain. If the terminus of the
                    line were to be united with that of the Edinburgh and Glasgow railway, much
                    advantage would accrue to both speculations. But, according to act of
                    Parliament, a mile intervenes at present between the dépôts of the two. The
                    Dundee and Newtyle railway is eleven miles in length, but branches are in
                    progress to Cupar-Angus and to Glammis. There are on the line three inclined
                    planes, and a tunnel of 340 yards. The Dundee and Forfar railway was opened
                    in</p>
                <p>1838. Its length is 16 <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                        4</hi> miles. The Arbroath and Forfar railway is just completed. The

                <p>About the middle of the seventeenth century, the lands of Scotland were valued,
                    with a view to ascertain what proportion of the land-tax and others should be
                    paid by each county ; and this valuation, called the “valued rent,” which had
                    been undertaken by the authority of Cromwell, was afterwards<pb

                <p>This is the value of the gross produce of the soil. Most of the land is rented by
                    tenants, only about a tenth part being supposed to be farmed by the landowners.
                    The exact amount of the rental of Scotland cannot be known. The rental for 1810,
                    including mines, fisheries, quarries, and the like,<note anchored="true" n="23"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ General Report, i. p. 123.</p></note>
                    was ascertained to be L.4,851,404; and it is supposed that, though considerable
                    variations have taken place in different districts, the rental of Scotland
                    continues at nearly the same amount ; for although many of the rents contracted
                    for, during the last years of the late war, have been greatly reduced, yet
                    others, from the falling in of the older leases, have been proportionally
                    advanced. As the common duration of the lease in Scotland is 19 years, the
                    average term of the current leases must be between 9 and 10 years; so that half
                    the leases current in the beginning of 1810 must have been entered into in the
                    first year of the century, at a period previous to any great enhancement of land
                    having taken place. Hence it is that we regard the rental of 1810 and of the
                    present time as nearly equal to each other. It is conjectured by an eminent
                    authority, that the rental of the 14,000,000 acres of mountain pasture,
                    including wood and waste lands, does not exceed L.850,000, or, in other words,
                    that it averages 1 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi>
                    s. per acre, whilst he estimates the rental of the arable portion at an average
                    of 16s. an acre.<note anchored="true" n="24" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Rent, we may here remark, has advanced more in Scotland during the last seventy
                    years, than perhaps in any old settled country during a similar period. The
                    entire rental of Scotland is not supposed to have exceeded L.l,000,000, or
                    L.1,200,000, in 1770. In 1795, it is believed to have been at least L.2,000,000
                    ; and since that time it has a good deal more than doubled.</p>
                <p>It is here worthy of remark, that both the law and the practice of Scotland are
                    favourable to agricultural enterprise. What in England are termed “ tenants at
                    will,” or tenants without a lease, are unknown in this portion of the empire.
                    Leases in Scotland may be said to be universal, extending to 15, 19, or 21
                    years. It was not uncommon, indeed, about fifty years ago, and before that time,
                    to give liferents, or leases for twice nineteen years, or even longer, a
                    circumstance highly favourable to enterprise on the part of the tenant. With the
                    exception of some districts in the Highlands and Islands, the system of small
                    farms has been abandoned, and has given way to farms of great extent, rented by
                    persons of intelligence and capital. There are no tithes. Poor-rates are
                    entirely unknown in about three- fourths of the parishes of Scotland ; and where
                    this assessment does exist, it is of comparatively trifling amount. Besides, so
                    large are the farms, that, exclusive of owners who cultivate their own property
                    or portions of it, there are supposed to be only about 40,000 tenants in
                    Scotland. And as farms are large, so they cannot be divided or sublet without
                    the consent of the landlord. This consent is seldom or never granted ; so that
                    in point of fact no such subdivision ever takes place. A lease, moreover, is
                    heritable; and on the death of a tenant, it is not parcelled out amongst his
                    children, but descends entire to his oldest son, or heir at law. All these
                    circumstances combined afford great encouragement to agricultural improvement
                    and enterprise.<pb facs="chi.28490931-1526160593_Page_818.jpf"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Judicial Establishments of Scotland.</hi></p>
                <p>In a remote, and what may be termed the aboriginal period of our judicial annals,
                    the king was chief justice of the kingdom ; and, with his council., made
                    progress through the realm for the administration of public justice. At that
                    time, indeed, the king executed in person the principal duties of government ;
                    and it was not till comparatively recent times that the different departments of
                    the state began to be exclusively assigned to distinct and responsible
                    officers.</p>
                <p>As late as the middle of the fifteenth century, an act was passed, in which “ the
                    three estates concluded, that our sovereign lord ride through the realm
                    incontinent, after there be word sent to his council., where any rebellion,
                    slaughter, huming, reif, or thieft happens; and there to call the sheriff of the
                    shire, and ere the king depart out of that shire, to set remeid of the harm, or
                    gif ony sik sall happen to be done, whether the default be in the officers or in
                    the doers, to be punished by the king ; the quhilk conclusion and ordinance, all
                    the barons of common assent and consent are obliged</p>
                <p>to assist baith with their power in bodies and gudes.” This act was passed in the
                    third parliament of king James the Second ; and in the fifth parliament of his
                    successor, when the courts of justice were regulated by statute, there was a
                    special proviso to the effect that, “ nevertheless, it sall be lawful to the
                    kingis highness to take decision of ony matter that comes before him, at his
                    compleasance, like as it was wont to be of before,” 1469, c. 26. Two centuries
                    afterwards, Charles the Second claimed a like power and prerogative ; and “ in a
                    dutiful and humble recognisance thereof,” the estates of parliament declared,
                    that notwithstanding of any jurisdictions or offices whatsoever, “ his sacred
                    majesty may, by himself or any commissionated by him, take cognisance and
                    decision of any cases or causes he pleases,” all government and jurisdiction
                    within the kingdom originally residing in him, 1681, c. 18. Such a right,
                    however, formed one of the grievances complained of at the Revolution ; and
                    since that event it has been deemed a settled part of the constitutional law of
                    the land, that the king has committed all judicial power to the judges, and
                    cannot himself administer justice in the courts.</p>
                <p>The justiciar <hi rend="italic">(justiciarius)</hi> was anciently the king’s
                        more,<pb facs="chi.28490931-1526160593_Page_819.jpf"
                        xml:id="eb07-19-s01-0754"/> immediate and principal officer. He seems to
                    have been 'derived from Normandy; and agreeably to the mixed constitution of
                    that country, he was here, as in England, <hi rend="italic">caput legis et
                        militiœ,</hi> at the head both of the law and of the military force of the
                    kingdom. He accompanied the king in his progresses through the realm, or
                    represented him in his absence ; and he had thus powers and jurisdiction as
                    universal in their nature as they were unlimited in extent. We find,
                    accordingly, repeated instances of the military prowess as well as judicial
                    firmness of our early justiciars ; and, not to mention other instances, in the
                    middle of the thirteenth century, Durward, when thwarted in the project he had
                    conceived of securing the throne to his descendants, joined Henry the Third in
                    France, and served in his army, till, by the influence of the English monarch,
                    he was re-instated in his high office of lord justiciar.</p>
                <p>It does not appear, however, that the justiciar ever became here the formidable
                    officer which he proved to be in England, where he was at one time a terror both
                    to the king and to his subjects. Various circumstances concurred to limit his
                    power. The chief of these, no doubt, was the influence of his adversary, the
                    Lord Chancellor, as the head and organ of the ecclesiastics ; but much also was
                    owing to the early partition of the office into a justiciary of ancient
                    Scotland, or the territory north of the Forth, and of Lothian, or the territory
                    south of the Forth. This partition of the office, indeed, is observed in the
                    very earliest notice of our justiciars. The series begins in the reign of
                    Malcolm the Fourth, and from that time we have distinct and separate justiciars
                    for Scotland and for Lothian. In neither of these was Galloway comprehended,
                    that district enjoying its own peculiar laws and customs;<note anchored="true"
                        n="25" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Stat. Alex. II. c. § 1.
                        fin.</p></note> but in 1258 it also got a separate justiciar. This state of
                    matters continued till the invasion of Scotland by Edward the First.</p>
                <p>In 1296, Sir William de Ormesby, a justice of the common pleas, and justice in
                    ayre in England, was constituted lord justiciar of Scotland by Edward, who also
                    associated with him William de Mortimer, an English justice of assize ; and the
                    next year the same king made Roger de Skotre, an English lawyer, justiciar of
                    Galloway. But ip 1299, John earl of Buchan was <hi rend="italic">justiciarius
                        Scotiœ;</hi> he was son of the last regular justiciar of Scotland, Alexander
                    earl of Buchan, who was upwards of thirty years in office previous to his death
                    in the year 1289. In 1305, however, Edward again put down the Scotch ; and
                    thereupon distributed the kingdom into four districts, appointing for each
                    district two justices, an Englishman and a Scotchman. These officers were of the
                    nature of the English justices of assize ; and when we take into consideration
                    the nature of the appointments which were at the same time made in the counties,
                    the object in view cannot be mistaken. Edward evidently contemplated putting the
                    whole island under one judicial system, which had shortly before been introduced
                    into England, namely, that of having annual or temporary sheriffs with a limited
                    jurisdiction, and confining the law business of the country to a few courts and
                    judges ; a system very different from that which previously existed both in
                    England and Scotland, where the great object was to bring justice home to every
                    man’s door in permanent local courts. The project, however, was stopped by
                    Edward’s death ; the justiciars of Scotland and Lothian were then displaced, and
                    permanent sheriffs restored. Robert the Second also restored to the people of
                    Galloway their ancient laws.<note anchored="true" n="26" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>* 2 Rob. I. c. 35.</p></note> Matters appear to have
                    generally continued in this state till the disastrous battle of Flodden. On that
                    event, which united all classes of the community, the office of lord justiciar,
                    or, as he was now styled, lord justice general, (in contradistinction to the
                    special justiciars now frequently appointed, as</p>
                <p>well for particular trials as for particular places and districts,) came into the
                    hands of a single individual, and comprehended the whole kingdom. The High Court
                    of Justiciary also began to be settled at Edinburgh, and from that time commence
                    the regular series of its books of adjournal.</p>
                <p>The Justiciar or Justice-General might now have become formidable; but
                    circumstances again concurred to reduce his power. The office fell into the
                    noble family of Argyll, where it continued hereditary for a century ; the Court
                    of Session was established with a universal civil jurisdiction ; and as that
                    court was co-ordinate with it on the land, the admiral of Scotland came to be
                    co-ordinate with it on the seas. By statute 1587, c.82, eight senators or
                    advocates of the College of Justice, were appointed as justiciar-deputes for the
                    different quarters into which the realm was then divided ; and by 1672, c. 16,
                    instead of the justice-deputes, five lords of session were constituted
                    commissioners of justiciary, along withthelord justice-general,and the
                    justice-clerk, which latter was now made vice-president of the court. By statute
                    1681, c. 16, too, the high admiral was declared the king’s lieutenant and
                    justice-general on the seas. By a recent act, however, the Court of Justiciary
                    re-acquired a jurisdiction in crimes at sea ; and by Will. IV. c. 69, which
                    entirely abolished the court of admiralty, the office of lord justice-general
                    was made to devolve on, and remain with that of lord-president of the Court of
                    Session. The effect of this seems to have been to place the justice-general at
                    the head of the administration of the law ; and thus, by a singular revolution,
                    to restore him, after the lapse of three hundred years, to his former situation
                    as lord chief-justice of Scotland.</p>
                <p>It may, in conclusion, be remarked here, that in the Court of Justiciary, which,
                    being a superior or at least co-ordinate tribunal, was but indirectly affected
                    by the changes in the law introduced by the Court of Session, several usages of
                    our most ancient common law have been preserved to this day. The court meets
                    about eleven o’clock, which was <hi rend="italic">the hour of cause</hi> of old,
                    (1587, c. 87) whereas the Court of Session, in direct contrast, rose at that
                    time, meeting, agreeably to the early hours of the ecclesiastics, at eight in
                    the morning, (1537, c. 49). So also, jury trial, when laid aside by the other
                    courts, continued here ; the verdict is still by a majority ; and in the <hi
                        rend="italic">assizes oath,</hi> we may trace at once the original character
                    of a jury as an inquest of the vicinage, and also the rhythmical measures of our
                    old legal formulae. The circuits of the Court of Justiciary were arranged in
                    their present form by the act 1587, c. 82. Previous to that time the justiciar
                    made a progress through the realm, from shire to shire, successively ; but, by
                    the above act, the realm was divided into four districts, or quarters. The
                    present circuits are, besides the Lothians or home circuit, the southern,
                    western, and northern circuits. The assize towns of the south, are Jedburgh,
                    Dumfries, and Ayr ; those of the west, Glasgow, Inverary, and Stirling ; those
                    of the north, Perth, Aberdeen, and Inverness.</p>
                <p>The Court of Session, that is to say, the first court so called, was erected in
                    1425, the year following King James the First’s return from his long captivity
                    in England. It was composed of the “ chancellor, and with him certain discreet
                    persons of the three estates, chosen and depute by the king and was to have a
                    like jurisdiction as that exercised by the king and his council. It was,
                    however, but of short duration ; for, on the king’s death, or rather on that of
                    Bishop Ward- law of St. Andrews, by whose influence it was in all likelihood
                    erected, Bishop Cameron, the chancellor, was removed from office, and the court
                    of the session expired. Attempts were afterwards made to revive it by Bishop
                    Horse- wood, secretary to king James II.; and, thirty years afterwards, by
                    Bishop Elphinstone, whose zeal for the establishment of<pb
                        facs="chi.28490931-1526160593_Page_820.jpf" xml:id="eb07-19-s01-0755"/> the
                    Roman law is well known. Accordingly in 1503, the court of daily council., which
                    was essentially a revival of the former court of the session, was established by
                    means of Bishop Elphinstone. And at length, whilst the kingdom was yet in a
                    state of distraction from the fatal losses at Flodden, the present Court of
                    Session or College of Justice was instituted ; and of the numerous attempts of
                    the clergy to establish the Roman law as the common law of the land, this was
                    the last and most successful.</p>
                <p>According to the simple principles of our old law, all suits originated by
                    plaint, claim, or summary application to the judge, setting forth the cause of
                    action; and the judge was bound of common right to administer justice therein.
                    But afterwards, a maxim was introduced that the judges were substitutes of the
                    crown, and consequently should take cognisance only of what was specially
                    referred to them. Brieves or mandatory letters from the king to the judges were
                    then invented ; and the chancel of the royal chapel became the great <hi
                        rend="italic">officina justitiæ,</hi> the shop or mint where the king’s
                    writs were framed, and sold out to parties injured, according to the exigency of
                    the case. These writs issued out from the chancel or chancery until the
                    institution of the College of Justice, when the chancellor and clergy, who were
                    the principal judges there, began a mint or shop of their own in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Bill chamber</hi> of the court, so called because the brieves,
                    or, as they are here termed <hi rend="italic">letters,</hi> issue out, not on
                    the oral application of the party, but on his “ bill” or written supplication.
                    This course of proceeding was adopted from the court of Rome ; and it is
                    observable, that in both cases the language employed is sometimes identical.
                    Thus, when the request or prayer of the bill is granted, the judgment is, <hi
                        rend="italic">Fiat ut petitur,</hi> which are the very words used by the
                    Pope in the like case ; and tire odd phrase, “Finds the letters orderly
                    proceeded,” is but a verbal translation of the <hi rend="italic">Male appellatum
                        et bene processum</hi> of the papal court. The names of the letters are also
                    the same, letters of advocation ion, suspension, and reduction, being equally
                    well known in both places ; and letters of horning, caption, and relaxation,
                    have their papal origin impressed upon them. The comparison might be carried
                    through our whole process to its minutest technicality, and also to the style
                    and habit of the judges. After the manner of the ecclesiastical tribunals, too,
                    the judges deliberated in secret conclave with shut doors, parties and their
                    counsel, and all others being removed (1537, c. 66); and there was no report of
                    the judges’ opinions, or of the reasons of the judgment, but only of the vote or
                    sentence. At the Revolution, however, the court was thrown open ; but so
                    powerful is custom over all men, that to this day the great body of the
                    practitioners continue to walk the Outer House.</p>
                <p>In modem times the court has been altered in almost every particular; its
                    constitution and jurisdiction, the number of the judges, the distribution of the
                    business, and the forms of proceeding. The machinery was indeed bad, but the
                    spirit which pervaded it was worse ; and the best antidote to this would perhaps
                    be the full force of public opinion, that is, perfect publicity, not merely of
                    hearing and judgment, but of every step in the administration of justice.</p>
                <p>According to its first institution, the court consisted of a president and
                    fourteen ordinary lords, half of the temporal estate and half spiritual, of
                    which the president likewise was one. The Lord Chancellor, who was also an
                    ecclesiastic, was made principal of the college, as it was termed, and as such
                    had a vote with the judges; and there was a</p>
                <p>reserved power to the king to appoint, at his pleasure, three or four
                    extraordinary lords, a power which the crown always exercised, and also
                    sometimes greatly abused. It was the Reformation which gave the first blow to
                    the court. From that event it began to lose its ecclesiastical, which had been
                    its earliest and most distinguishing feature. The Revolution followed, and
                    opened up to the public eye the heretofore secret tribunal. And at the union
                    with England it ceased to be supreme, though this last peculiarity, and that by
                    which <hi rend="italic">the Lords</hi> became so formidable in the country, was
                    long struggled for, and is yet perhaps but imperfectly given up by the court.
                    These important changes, however, affected the spirit and character of the
                    court, rather than its external form, which remained much as it was before. But
                    they prepared the way for alterations there too ; and during the last thirty
                    years, a great number of public statutes have been passed, altering the details
                    of the court, and otherwise regulating the administration of justice throughout
                    the kingdom.</p>
                <p>In 1808, the commencement of the period just referred to, the court was formed
                    into two divisions; or, in effect, two communicating but equal and independent
                    courts. The reason assigned for this change, was the greatly increased number of
                    lawsuits from the great extension of agriculture, commerce, manufactures, and
                    population, and the consequent multiplication of transactions in Scotland. There
                    is every ground to believe, however, that much of the supposed business was
                    caused by the tedious methods of proof and written pleadings adopted by the
                    court, and its endless judgments and rehearings; for in the degree in which
                    these have been abolished, the court has been able to absorb and dispatch the
                    business of the other superior courts, and still to allow a decrease in the
                    number of its judges. These are now only thirteen in all. Each division is
                    composed of four judges ; the Lord President, who is properly head of the whole
                    court, presiding in the First Division, and the Lord Justice-Clerk presiding in
                    the Second. The remaining judges sit separately in the Outer House, as Lords
                    Ordinary. This term was originally given to all the judges under the president,
                    and they served in the Outer House by rotation; but amongst other recent
                    changes, the five junior judges were at first made permanent Lords Ordinary, as
                    attached to a particular division of the Inner House, but now without any such
                    relation. The junior or youngest Lord Ordinary of all is Ordinary on the Bills,
                    and has a peculiar class of cases assigned to him. But it is to be observed,
                    that from him, and from the other Ordinaries, an appeal lies, or a proceeding in
                    the nature of an appeal, to the Inner House; which, besides this appellate, has
                    also some original jurisdiction. It is not necessary to add, that there is much
                    imperfection in this whole system of judicature. There appears to have been
                    little unity of design in its formation ; there is considerable complexity in
                    its actual working, and there is no great satisfaction in its results.<note

                <p>Let us now turn our attention to the local courts throughout the kingdom.</p>
                <p>In early times the realm was divided into provinces, clanships, or counties, in
                    each of which was a maormor, maor, mayor or mair, as the king’s executive and
                    ministerial officer; and in every county or province there were divers judges,
                    each exercising judicial functions. The provinces and judicial districts of
                    those times, however, are now but imperfectly known; and, as might be expected,
                    the series of mayors and judges cannot by any means be made out. With re-<pb

                    spect to the latter, viz., the Celtic judge, we have not traced him to a later
                    period than the beginning of the fourteenth century. He was in all probability
                    extinguished during king Edward’s invasion of Scotland in the unhappy times
                    which followed on the death of king Alexander the Third. The sheriff was then
                    universally established ; and as that officer engrossed to himself the functions
                    both of the judge and mair, the former disappeared entirely from our annals,
                    whilst the latter gradually degenerated into the sheriff's officer, with whom,
                    accordingly, he is, to the present day, found mixed up in some of the northern
                    counties.</p>
                <p>The most ancient sheriff was certainly the <hi rend="italic">comes</hi> or earl.
                    There is no direct evidence to that effect, however ; and from a remote time,
                    the officer so called was the <hi rend="italic">vice-cornes.</hi> The office was
                    not a century in existence amongst us, when, falling into the hands of the great
                    local proprietors, it began to descend to heirs with the paternal estate. The
                    sheriffship of Ayr, which was erected in the year 1221, out of the bailiaries of
                    Kyle, Carrick, and Cuningham, was from the first hereditary. It is not
                    surprising that the hereditary <hi rend="italic">vice-cornes</hi> should soon
                    cense to perform in person the duties of his office; these were accordingly
                    devolved on a deputy or <hi rend="italic">sub-vice-comes.</hi> The earliest
                    officer of this sort we have met with, is <hi rend="italic">Alan de Pilch,</hi>
                    or Alan of the hairy garment, sub-vice-comes de Inverness, temp. Robert I.;<note

                            p. 29.</p></note> but sheriff- deputes are mentioned much earlier,<note

                                rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Stat. Will. c. 14. Stat. Alex. II. c.
                            14.</p></note> and to such an extent was the abuse of deputation
                    carried, that in some counties, that of Cromarty for instance, the district was
                    partitioned into various deputy-sheriffships, and individuals appointed, such as
                    officers of the army, medical men, and others, in situations of life perfectly
                    incompatible with the due discharge of the office. The office also in many
                    instances became hereditary; and another was required to execute the active
                    duties of the place, or <hi rend="italic">pro-sub-vice-cornes.</hi> Thus, at the
                    time of the jurisdiction act in 1747, there were in most or all of the counties,
                    omitting the <hi rend="italic">comes,</hi> count or earl, a sheriff-principal or
                    high sheriff, and sheriff-depute, and a sheriff-substitute. All these were
                    continued by the above act; but the judicial powers were confined to the two
                    last, whose duties and qualifications have also been repeatedly regulated. It
                    would undoubtedly have been more agreeable to principle, however, to have
                    abolished offices which grew out of the abuses of the times, and assigned to
                    every sheriff a reasonable district in respect of extent and population, with
                    constant residence therein, and the exercise of judicial functions only. In
                    determining the number, character, and situation of courts in a country, the
                    great problem evidently is, so to distribute them as to secure two things,
                    namely, to bring justice home to every man’s door, and to mature a sound and
                    fixed system of jurisprudence. In England, the latter object appears to have
                    been principally regarded since the days of Edward the First, before whose time
                    England and Scotland were equally distinguished for their local courts. But
                    what, we may ask, avails the best system of law, if it be remote or difficult of
                    access ? The end is in such case sacrificed to the means; and a multitude of
                    petty courts, with a few practitioners in each, would prove the ruin not only of
                    the legal profession, but of the law itself.</p>
                <p>The sheriff-principal, or high sheriff, is lord lieutenant of his county, and
                    appointed at pleasure by the crown. The sheriff-depute, so called, is also
                    appointed by the crown ; but he is quite independent of the high sheriff. He
                    must be an advocate of at least three years’ standing; he holds his office
                    during life, or good behaviour; and he receives a salary, varying, according to
                    the shire, from L.350 to L.1200 a-year. The sheriff-substitute must be of the
                    profession of the law,</p>
                <p>though not necessarily a member of the bar. He is named by the sheriff-depute of
                    the shire, but paid by the crown, and is otherwise an independent officer. In
                    every county there is a high sheriff or lord lieutenant. The same may be said of
                    the sheriff-depute, except as to the united shires of Clackmannan and Kinross,
                    Elgin and Nairn, Ross and Cromarty. Ross, Sutherland, and Caithness, were
                    originally parts of the great shire of Inverness; but in the seventeenth century
                    they became disjoined, and were erected into separate shires. By the
                    jurisdiction act, however, Ross was put under the same sheriff with the ancient
                    shire of Cromarty, and has continued so ever since. Sutherland and Caithness
                    were then also re-united; but in 1806 these were again separated. Kinross was
                    originally part of Fife; but it was afterwards separated, then re-united, and in
                    1807 disjoined again, and united to Clackmannan. With respect to the
                    sheriff-substitute, in every shire there is at least one ; but Edinburgh, Fife,
                    Forfar, Perth, Renfrew, and Sutherland, have each two, Kirkcudbright and Argyle
                    have each three, Lanark and Inverness have each four, and in one of the
                    districts of Ross there is a sort of assistant substitute.</p>
                <p>The jurisdiction of the county courts was originally most extensive ; and as to
                    civil suits in particular, there seems to have been scarcely any limitation. It
                    was the policy of the Court of Session, however, to make itself the great law
                    court of the kingdom ; and as it gradually absorbed the civil jurisdiction of
                    the justiciary, so, by a bold stratagem, it stripped the sheriff of all power to
                    decide upon questions of real property. Such questions were formerly tried under
                    the brieve of right, a judicial writ so named, because issued to try what was
                    esteemed the highest right, that of property in land ; and it is clear that this
                    brieve was <hi rend="italic">in viridi observantia,</hi> and competent to
                    sheriffs, till within a very few years of the institution of the Court of
                    Session. This is clear from the act 1503, c. 95, which was passed to regulate
                    it; and it is familiarly referred to by the poet Dunbar, in his Dance of the
                    Seven Deadly Sins, where, speaking of the occupations of the damned, he
                    says,</p>
                <p>Yet the Court of Session was scarcely established, when it boldly adjudged this
                    brieve “ nocht to have bene, nor yet to be thir mony yeires in use ;”<note

                    by repressing the writ, ousted the sheriff of his real jurisdiction, Boon took
                    it to itself exclusively,<note anchored="true" n="31" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>Bishop of Aberdeen <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Ogilvy, 3d

                    Bill-chamber. The sheriff, however, still continued competent to possessory
                    actions ; and by a recent statute, his jurisdiction has even extended to all
                    actions and proceedings relative to nuisance or damages, arising from an undue
                    exercise of the right of property, and also to questions touching the
                    constitution or exercise of real or judicial servitudes, which is so far a
                    restoration of his ancient powers. Besides the ordinary jurisdiction, civil and
                    criminal, of the county court, the sheriff is empowered to decide summarily in
                    questions of debt, when the sum in dispute does not exceed eight pounds. These
                    small debt courts were instituted in 1825, with a view to extend and improve the
                    like jurisdiction, which had been conferred upon justices of the peace about
                    thirty years before. The summary redress which such courts afford is of the
                    greatest benefit to trade and to good neighbourhood, in consequence of the
                    little sacrifice of time, money, and feeling they require ; and they are
                    accordingly now extensively established, not only in this<pb

                <p>The courts we have now adverted to comprehend the public and general courts of
                    the kingdom, which have a public and general jurisdiction ; but besides these,
                    there are, or rather were, some whose jurisdiction was limited to particular
                    sorts of causes only. We allude to the Court of Exchequer, and the
                    ecclesiastical and maritime courts.</p>
                <p>With respect to the first of these, the old Scotch court, composed of the
                    treasurer and lords auditors of exchequer, was superseded at the union by a
                    Court of Exchequer, composed of a lord chief-baron and four puisne barons ; and
                    in addition to certain ministerial powers continued from the old court, it had
                    the like authority, jurisdiction, and course of procedure as the Court of
                    Exchequer in England, after which generally it was modelled. It was an absurdly
                    large and expensive establishment. It had comparatively nothing to do ; and as
                    the judges might be, and some of them commonly were, English barristers, it
                    never could be opened up, like the exchequer of England, to the ordinary law
                    business of the country. Accordingly the barons were gradually reduced, and the
                    business is now transacted by a lord of session sitting as a judge in
                    exchequer.</p>
                <p>The Commission of Teinds, which was first erected at the Reformation, was in like
                    manner remodelled at the Union. It was formerly vested with powers for the
                    planting of churches, assigning and modifying stipends, and the valuation and
                    sale of teinds. But by a recent statute, all actions for the valuation or sale
                    of teinds, all actions of suspension or reduction of localities, and all actions
                    of declarator or reduction connected with teinds, must be brought and decided in
                    the Court of Session.</p>
                <p>In times of popery, causes ecclesiastical were tried by the archdeacon’s
                    official, the bishop’s commissary, and the auditor or official principal of the
                    province ; from which last an appeal lay to the pope, who generally determined
                    the matter by commission. But at the Reformation, commissaries named by tne
                    crown were appointed in every commissariat ; and a Commissary Court, with
                    original and appellate jurisdiction, was also established at Edinburgh, of which
                    Sir James Balfour, the former official of St. Andrews, within the archdeaconry
                    of Lothian, was the first chief- judge. The commissary courts continued till
                    recent times, when the office of the local commissaries was abolished, and soon
                    afterwards the Commissary Court of Edinburgh, their powers and jurisdiction
                    being transferred to the Court of</p>
                <p>Session, and, in as far as regards confirmation pf testaments, to the sheriff or
                    county courts.</p>
                <p>The jurisdiction of the Admiralty cannot perhaps be traced to an earlier period
                    than the beginning of the sixteenth century, when the office of lord justiciar,
                    who was of old the supreme judge in all manner of causes, became hereditary in
                    the noble family of Argyll, and the authority of the Admiralty was also long
                    very limited. It was confined to seafaring causes, and in these it had no
                    exclusive jurisdiction.<note anchored="true" n="33" place="bottom"

                    judge of the Admiralty. Towards the end of the same century, Alexander King,
                    advocate, filled the same office ; and from the date of his <hi rend="italic"

                    that branch of jurisprudence in Great Britain, the court of Admiralty rose into
                    importance. By the act 1609, c. 15, it was declared a sovereign judicatory, and
                    letters of homing were allowed on its decrees ; and the reputation of the court
                    being afterwards sustained by a succession of eminent judges, such as Acheson of
                    Glencairney, Roberton of Beidlay, and Lyon of Carse, all of whom became lords of
                    Session, it began to extend its jurisdiction generally to mercantile, and not,
                    as before, to mere seafaring causes. The above act was then ratified by that of
                    1681, c. 16, by which the ground of the court was farther cleared and enlarged ;
                    the admiral being now also styled the high admiral, and declared the king’s
                    lieutenant and justice-general on the high seas. By a later statute, provision
                    was made for a stated salary of L.100 to the judge of the Admiralty. This was
                    renewed by the act 1704, c. 8; and by 26 Geo. III. c. 47, the salary was made
                    L.400, which was afterwards raised to L.800 a-year. The court, however, did not
                    long enjoy this flow of prosperity By the 6 Geo. IV. c. 120, jurisdiction in
                    prize and capture was withdrawn, and vested in the Admiralty of England ; and by
                    a later statute the court was altogether abolished, and its remaining
                    jurisdiction transferred to the Court of Session, and Sheriff courts ; the High
                    Court of Justiciary having also previously re-acquired, as of old, a co-ordinate
                    jurisdiction in crimes at sea.</p>

                    Alex. II. c. 6, which is among the earliest regulations on the subject in the
                    Scotch law. There were of old divers sanctuaries, or, as they were termed, <hi
                        rend="italic">girths,</hi> (1469, c. 35 ; 1535, c. 23 ; 1555, c. 31), and
                    mostly ecclesiastical ; there being a constant rivalry at all times between the
                    sovereign power and the ecclesiastical. But the only one now in use, is the
                    sanctuary of Holyrood, which, besides usage, has two main foundations, namely, a
                    religious house, and a royal palace, especially the former, the precincts being
                    usually called the sanctuary of Holyroodhouse, and the court there the Abbey
                    court. The jurisdiction of the place is administered by a bailie, who holds a
                    court for debt, and other civil obligations, where the debtor dwells within the
                    precincts.</p>
                <p>Regalities were another species of exempt territory. They were rights of
                    exclusive power and jurisdiction, civil and criminal, real and personal, granted
                    by the crown to the higher nobility ;<note anchored="true" n="35" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">* Regales,</hi> Cod. Theod. vii. 1,

                    perceived, yet they were not altogether abolished till the passing of the
                    jurisdiction act, in the middle of last century. By 1455, c. 43, it was enacted
                    that all regalities in the king’s hands should be annexed to the royalty and
                    made subject to the king’s courts and officers. It was about the date of that
                    act that the great district of Kirkcudbright fell to the crown by the forfeiture
                    of its lord ; and a <hi rend="italic">senes- challis</hi> being thereupon
                    appointed, it has ever since remained the stewartry of Kirkcudbright. But
                    neither this nor the islands of Orkney and Zetland, which were also erected into
                    a stewartry,<note anchored="true" n="36" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>•
                            See 1669, c. 13.</p></note> differs materially from a shire ; each
                    having a court perfectly of the nature of a sheriff or county court. Besides
                    these, there were other stewartries, such as Strath- em and Menteith in
                    Perthshire, and Annandale in Dumfries ; but by the jurisdiction act, they merged
                    into their respective shires.</p>
                <p>Burghs form yet another species of exempt territory ; the principal character of
                    a burgh being its separate jurisdiction and independent government, but upon
                    reasons altogether different from either sanctuaries or regalities. They arise
                    neither from superstition nor princes’ favours. They have their origin in the
                    wants and social tendencies of our nature ; they are the chosen seats of
                    civilization and the arts of life ; and the distinction between them and shires
                    pervades the entire political constitution of the country. There are three sorts
                    of burghs, namely, burghs of barony, burghs of regality, and burghs of royalty
                    or royal burghs ; and in establishing these last, it would seem to have been the
                    general policy of government to divide the realm into districts, in each of
                    which a royal burgh was placed. Several of the burghs are counties of
                    themselves, or counties corporate, such as Edinburgh, Stirling, Perth, Aberdeen,
                    and Inverness ; and these obviously contain within themselves all the elements
                    of government and judicature. But it has unfortunately happened, that none of
                    the burgh courts has kept pace with the advance of intelligence, the progress of
                    trade, or the increase of commercial transactions. Justice continues to be
                    administered there just as it was centuries ago. The consequence is, that the
                    peculiar feature of the burghs as independent jurisdictions has in many cases
                    given way ; the burgh courts have been forsaken for the sheriff and justice of
                    peace courts ; and it seems to have become a public question of policy, whether
                    they should not be altogether abolished. The same causes, however, which gave
                    origin to burghs, remain ; and therefore it would seem to be the wiser policy to
                    improve the burgh courts, rather than to abolish them ; to improve them, by
                    relieving the magistrates of all, or at least the more important judicial
                    duties, and to devolve these upon fixed and qualified judges.</p>
                <p>The superintendence of the royal burghs was in the king’s chamberlain, who held
                        <hi rend="italic">ogres,</hi> or itinerant courts, at which the magistrates
                    and burgesses of burghs were bound to give attendance, and where he heard and
                    determined all charges made against them. He was also in use from the earliest
                    times, to hold, in the southern part of the kingdom, courts of four boroughs ;
                    which were so called because composed of delegates from the four burghs,
                    originally of Edinburgh, Stirling, Berwick, and Roxburgh, but afterwards of
                    Edinburgh, Stirling, Lanark, and Linlithgow. These delegates assembled before
                    the chamberlain, and formed for appeals from the chamberlain ayres, and the
                    different burgh courts, a tribunal which was to burgesses what the high court of
                    parliament was to the other inhabitants of the kingdom, the last and highest
                    court of appeal. The northern burghs had been long under a peculiar government
                    of their own. They formed a sort of Hanseatic league ; for as early as the reign
                    of William the Lyon, a royal charter was granted to the king’s burghers <hi
                        rend="italic">of</hi> Aberdeen and of Moray, and all beyond the Grampians,
                    to hold their free “ansum” or hanse, as freely, quietly, fully, and honourably,
                    as their predecessors had done in the time of the granter’s royal
                        grandfather.<note anchored="true" n="37" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                            vol. i. p. 8.</p></note> In the beginning of the fifteenth century, a
                    court of four boroughs was holden at Stirling, where it was resolved that
                    deputies from each of the royal burghs south of the Spey should convene yearly
                    to consider and conclude on all matters affecting the commonweal of the royal
                    burghs, their liberty and court. This convention was in all likelihood formed in
                    imitation of the northern Hanse. The inconvenience of having two separate yet
                    similar assemblies in the kingdom, however, must have been quickly felt ; and,
                    at the same time, the ease and propriety of uniting them, and thus assimilating
                    the regimen of all the burghs, obvious. Accordingly, in the end of the same
                    century, an act of parliament was passed, (1487, c. 3.) appointing deputies from
                    all the royal burghs, “ <hi rend="italic">baith north and south"</hi> to meet in
                    convention yearly, thus forming the convention of royal burghs which has been
                    ever since continued. The place of meeting was fixed at Inverkeithing, on the
                    north of the Forth, probably from its central situation ; but the convention
                    soon removed to Edinburgh, which had long been the seat of the court of four
                    boroughs, and was now become the metropolis of the kingdom. On the institution
                    of the Court of Session, the court of four boroughs and the chamberlain ayres
                    quickly fell into disuse, their judicial, and many of their ministerial
                    functions having been engrossed by that court ; and from the time of Malcolm
                    lord Fleming, who fell at Pinkey in 1547, the office of chamberlain, or, as he
                    was now styled, lord great chamberlain, ceased to be exercised. The convention,
                    however, continued its yearly meetings ; indeed, its records begin only at this
                    time, when the Lord Provost of Edinburgh became by devolution its standing
                    preses, and the Town-Clerk of Edinburgh its standing clerk.</p>
                <p>Let us now return to the general and ordinary courts of the kingdom ; the Court
                    of Justiciary and Court of Session, the Sheriff Court, and the Bailie Courts of
                    burghs.</p>
                <p>The Court of Justiciary was originally the great pattern followed in the
                    administration of justice throughout the kingdom ; but soon after the
                    institution of the Court of Session, an act passed (1540, c. 72.) requiring all
                    sheriffs and other temporal judges to copy the proceedings, not of the justices,
                    as before<note anchored="true" n="38" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>* Stat.
                            Rob. III. c. 33.</p></note> but of the Lords of Session ; and the
                    principle of this enactment was adopted in the recent judicature act regulating
                    the forms of process in civil matters. The course of proceeding in ordinary
                    actions is now generally as follows. The defendant, or, as he is called, the
                    defender, is first summoned on the original writ to compear in court
                        peremptorily<pb facs="chi.28490931-1526160593_Page_824.jpf"
                        xml:id="eb07-19-s01-0759"/> on a day named, the intervening days being held
                    as <hi rend="italic">inducite legales.</hi> If, when the cause is called, the
                    defender do not appear, decree in absence may pass against him. If he appear, he
                    is allowed certain days, termed <hi rend="italic">inducite deliberatoriæ,</hi>
                    to see the original writ and productions, and determine whether and how he shall
                    proceed. He then puts in his defence and plea, admitting or denying the facts
                    alleged, stating any other facts which he offers to prove, and subjoining a
                    summary of the pleas in law on which he means to found. The defences and all
                    subsequent steps of procedure must be drawn by counsel ; and after the defences
                    are given in, every order in the cause must be moved for in court and determined
                    by the judges. If the parties choose they may go to judgment on the summons and
                    defences ; but commonly more specific pleadings are ordered, such as a
                    condescendence and answers, or mutual condescendences, which are similar to the
                        <hi rend="italic">responsive allegations</hi> of the ecclesiastical courts,
                    and both are borrowed from the <hi rend="italic">articuli et responsiones</hi>
                    of the papal process. These papers being revised by the parties, the record,
                    ready to be closed, is transmitted to the judge for private consideration ;
                    after which, it is put out by him for debate. Parties are then heard in court by
                    their counsel, and the judge may thereupon either give judgment at once, or, as
                    is commonly the case, take the proceedings to chambers again for consideration,
                    and there write out his decision ; or, if any difficulty occur in the
                    determination of the case, he may report the point to the Inner House for their
                    direction or decision ; or again, if the cause involves details or difficulties,
                    he may order cases, that is to say, full argumentative pleadings, and then
                    either decide the cause or report it to the Inner House. When the Lord Ordinary
                    gives an interlocutor or judgment, it may be carried to the Inner House by
                    reclaiming note, upon which counsel are heard, and the decision of the Lord
                    Ordinary either altered or adhered to, and with or without cost, as the court
                    may determine.</p>
                <p>In jury causes, that is to say, causes appropriated for trial by jury, or in
                    which jury trial is to take place, the course of proceeding now pointed out is
                    but partially followed. In such causes a record is made up in the manner
                    described; but as the system of pleading adopted in the Scotch courts does not,
                    as in the common law courts of England, bring out the issue whether of fact or
                    law, issues must be prepared. This is done by an officer of court, and in
                    settling issues there is frequently considerable difficulty. In the proceedings
                    of sheriff and bailie courts, however, there is something like an approach to
                    the English system, an answer or reply to the defence being allowed. But here
                    the analogy ends. There is no rejoinder unless ordered ; and from the multitude
                    of pleas pleadable in each paper, a single issue, or indeed any issue, in the
                    technical sense of the term, is never produced. It is also to be observed, that
                    jury trials in civil causes gradually fell into disuse in the local courts after
                    the institution of the Court of Session, where such mode of trial was unknown
                    till recently introduced by statute ; and it has not been re-established except
                    in the Court of Session. The details of a jury trial, when it does take place,
                    need not be specified here, though they differ in some few particulars from the
                    like proceeding in England.</p>
                <p>Of the several methods of defence and proof in criminal cases, the earliest, and
                    at the same time the rudest, was battle, in which the parties litigant put the
                    truth of their averment on the issue of a judicial combat.<note anchored="true"

                    judgment of God, though that appellation came more peculiarly to designate
                    another method of a different origin, but no less uncertain as a criterion of
                    truth. This was ordeal, which, if not introduced, was at least continued and
                    countenanced by the ecclesiastics. It was of various kinds, but those known</p>
                <p>in Scotland were water, fire, and iron;<note anchored="true" n="40"

                    applications of these, so accordingly was he judged guilty or innocent. Another
                    method of trial used also instead of battle, was that by compurgators, where the
                    defendant exculpated or purged himself of the guilt imputed to him, by declaring
                    his innocence on oath, and also producing a number of persons to swear that they
                    believed he swore truly, which they did in general on their knowledge of his
                        character.<note anchored="true" n="41" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’

                    methods of trial have been abolished, or have gradually become obsolete, which
                    leads us to notice the course of proceeding now in use in ordinary cases.</p>
                <p>The first step is to commit the accused for examination, when, if no case is made
                    out, he is dismissed, otherwise he is committed for trial. From that moment he

                    summoned to the day fixed, being at the same time served with a duplicate of the
                    indictment or criminal letters, and lists of the assize (jurors) and witnesses
                    on his own behalf. On the day of compearance, he must appear personally,
                    (otherwise he is outlawed,) and stand at the bar or pannel whence he is termed
                    the <hi rend="italic">pantiel;</hi> but in all cases he is allowed counsel and
                    agent. If, on arraignment, he has no special matter to plead, the libel is read
                    to him, and his confession, if made, is recorded. If any special plea on the
                    relevancy is offered, it is determined by the judges on oral or written
                    argument. Issue being joined, the evidence on both sides is laid before the
                    court and jury, which are now impannelled for that purpose. The jury are then
                    addressed by the pannel or his counsel, and the evidence is afterwards summed up
                    by the presiding judge, with adirection in law to the jury; when the jury, after
                    deliberation, return, unanimously, or by a majority, a verdict of guilty, not
                    proven, or not guilty, as the case may be. A verdict of not guilty declares the
                    prisoner’s innocence ; a verdict of not proven indicates suspicion, but
                    insufficient proof of guilt ; and in the case of a verdict of guilty, but in
                    that only, sentence is pronounced. The nature of the sentence depends not only
                    on the crime, but also on the public prosecutor ; for of a long time past that
                    officer has been in use to exercise a power to restrict the pains of law. This
                    important power is commonly exercised with great discretion ; yet undoubtedly it
                    is a dangerous one to hold, and to it more, perhaps, than to any other cause
                    whatever, is to be ascribed the singularly lax state of the criminal law of
                    Scotland in reference to the punishment for crime.</p>
                <p>There seems little doubt but that in early times the king was public prosecutor,
                    as he was also generalissimo and chief justice of the kingdom. His great
                    officer, the justiciar, who followed him, as we have seen, in the two latter
                    capacities, followed him likewise in the capacity of public prosecutor ; and
                    what the justiciar did throughout the realm generally, the same did the sheriff
                    in his particular county. Accordingly, we find it enacted in our early law that
                    if any stranger remained in a town longer than a night without finding a pledge
                    or surety for his good behaviour, “ the justiciar or the sheriff shall accuse
                        him;"<note anchored="true" n="42" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Quon.
                            Ate. c. 63.</p></note> and so late as the middle of the fifteenth
                    century it was enacted “ that all mairs and serjeants arrest at the sheriff’s
                    bidding, albeit na party follower be, all trespassers, and that the sheriff
                    follow said trespassers in the king’s name, gif na party follower appears,”
                    (1436, c. 140.) In process of time however, as the principles of civil liberty
                    and the elements of our constitution came to be better understood, distinct
                    officers were appointed to the different departments of the State ; and this
                    office of public prosecutor naturally devolved upon the crown counsel. The
                    principal of these is the lord advocate, and next to<pb

                    is the solicitor-general, an officer derived from the English courts, and
                    probably not known in Scotland earlier than the union of the crowns in the
                    beginning of the seventeenth century. There are also four standing deputies to
                    the lord advocate, or “ advocate deputes,” as they are termed, who had their
                    origin by the act 1587, c. 82, which divided the realm into circuits for the
                    administration of criminal justice. The procurators fiscal of the county and
                    burgh courts, who arc the public prosecutors in their respective districts, may
                    also be regarded as deputies of the lord advocate. It is true they do not derive
                    their authority from him ; but they communicate with him in the prosecution of
                    criminals, and in that department have generally the same powers and duties. The
                    following table will shew the great importance of public prosecutor.</p>

                <p>Of both which there were at the instance of the</p>
                <p>Lord Advocate.</p>
                <p>The following statement will also give some idea of the working of the criminal
                    jurisdictions of Scotland. It relates to the year 1836. In that year there were
                    2922 persons charged with crime in the several counties and burghs of Scotland.
                    Of these 289 were discharged without trial, and 219 from other causes ; and of
                    the remaining 2414, there were tried by the Justiciary, 574, (viz. 173 in the
                    high court, and 404 on circuit); by sheriffs, 1325,(viz.547with jury, and 778
                    without jury); and5l5 by burgh magistrates, justices of the peace, and others.
                    Of the above 2414 also, 2152 were convicted ; in 194 cases the charges were
                    found not proven ; 30 were declared not guilty ; 36 were outlawed, and two were
                    found insane on arraignment. And finally, of the 2152 convicted, 1647 were
                    sentenced to imprisonment of different periods, 305 were condemned to
                    transportation for different periods, 187 were punished by fine, 6 were
                    discharged on sureties, 2 had sentence of death, 1 was executed, and 5 received
                    no sentence.</p>
                <p>Next in dignity to the crown counsel is the dean of faculty, <hi rend="italic"
                        >facultatis juridicœ decanus;</hi> or rather we should say that between
                    these learned personages there has been a contest waged, the latter claiming
                    precedence of the former. This claim, however, seems to be just a <hi
                        rend="italic">residuum</hi> of the once greater claims of the whole college
                    of justice, and the dispute but a continuation of the conflict formerly
                    maintained by the court against all power except its own. The place of dean of
                    faculty has been held by some of the first men of the kingdom ; and in the
                    course of the last two hundred years there have been no less than three
                    instances of elevation from it at once to the presidentcy of the Court of
                    Session, Sir George Lockhart, Sir Hugh Dalrymple, and Mr. Blair. But in all the
                    common elements of rank there cannot be a doubt of its inferiority to that of
                    crown counsel.</p>
                <p>According to the original constitution of the Court of Session, the members were
                    associated into a college, with a view to a collegiate or common life ; the
                    judges or lords of Session being “ senators” of the college, and the advocates
                    the <hi rend="italic">facultas juridica,</hi> or faculty of law, subordinate to
                    whom were the students of law, or “ servitors,” as they were termed, who were
                    attached to particular advocates as their</p>
                <p>pupils in the study of the law. The celebrated Sir Thomas Hope was in early life
                    a “ servitor” to Sir Thomas Nicol- son. The term “ servitor” was a college term,
                    well known in the University of Oxford ; but it has gone out of use with us,
                    those formerly so designed being now termed “ advocates’ first clerks.” But to
                    what extent such intention was ever carried out, or whether any thing existed
                    here in the nature of the English laws of court or Doctors Commons, does not
                    appear. At present there is nothing of the sort. The original entry money to the
                    Faculty was L.40 Scotch, and so it continued till 1672, the year in which the
                    statute for the regulation of the judicatories passed, when the sum was raised
                    to 200 merks. In the beginning of last century it had advanced to L.40 sterling,
                    and now, after repeated advances, the fees of entry are upwards of 250 guineas
                    besides extras. The number of the Faculty which, forty years ago, was about 260,
                    is at present about 470, averaging of late about twelve in the year ; but a
                    fourth part only are in attendance on the courts.</p>
                <p>The distinction of counsel and agents in Scotch practice is of modern origin. The
                    earliest agents properly so called, or practitioners below the bar, were the “
                    servitors” above mentioned, or advocates’ first clerks in the Court of Session ;
                    and all others were forbidden to act as agents.<note anchored="true" n="43"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See AS. 13th July 1596, Stat. 1672, c.
                            16, and AS. '26th February 1678.</p></note> By the injunctions of their
                    chief officer, the Secretary of State, in 1594, Writers to the Signet were also
                    prohibited from acting as agents; and by a bye law of the body itself in 1676,
                    every member who should take it upon him to act as an agent, was made liable to
                    be prosecuted. They came at length, however, to act likewise as agents, and are
                    now a large and influential body. Sixty years ago they were not more than 100;
                    but about forty years ago they were 280. At present they are upwards of 700 in
                    number, and almost all of them resident in Edinburgh ; and the average entries
                    yearly are the same in proportion as into the Faculty. There is another class of
                    agents, the Solicitors before the supreme courts, enrolled under AS. 9 July
                    1754, and AS. 1772. They are upwards of a hundred in number, which is somewhat
                    more than the enrolled number of advocates’ first clerks, a body which lias
                    remained much about the same for the last forty years.</p>
                <p>With respect to the procurators of the inferior courts, they appear to have
                    generally continued, till recent times, on the same close footing on which the
                    practitioners of all the courts stood previous to the institution of the Court
                    of Session ; nor are they to this day admitted by the supreme court, or
                    marshalled, like the bar, into one body, but are severally admitted, on varying
                    qualifications, by the respective courts throughout the kingdom. They are of
                    course restricted to the particular court so admitting them ; whereas the
                    advocates of the College of Justice form the proper bar of Scotland, and being
                    admitted by the supreme court, may practise in any court of the kingdom. The
                    same principle might be extended with evident advantage ; and the local courts
                    opened up to the talent and practical skill of the agents of the Court of
                    Session. The present arrangements are very plainly imperfect, and incapable of
                    maturing a uniform and settled system of jurisprudence in the country. There is
                    not a tenth part of the law business of the country conducted by the counsel and
                    agents of the supreme court. Unless a different provision is made, both the law
                    and the legal profession of Scotland will inevitably suffer.</p>
                <p>In the style of the procurators of Aberdeen, there is a peculiarity which may
                    here be taken notice of and explained. They are styled <hi rend="italic"
                        >advocates,</hi> which name is otherwise appropriated to the advocates of
                    the College of Justice. The truth is that the appellation of advocate is amongst
                    the earliest which we find in our records applied to practitioners<pb

                <p>of the law, (1424, c. 45); and it appears that persons so designated were
                    formerly’ in every court of the kingdom, (1424, c. 45, 1429, c. 11G—125.) The
                    term was used synonymously with procurators ; and at the institution of the
                    Court of Session both terms were applied together, (1537, c. 64.) The sheriff
                    court of Aberdeen was the earliest county court regulated subsequent to the
                    erection of the Court of Session ; and in the act of court then passed, the two
                    names were used promiscuously. Hence has arisen the common use of the style of
                    advocate ; but the advocates of Aberdeen form no part of the proper bar of
                    Scotland, any more than the practitioners of any of the local courts whatsoever.
                    The entry of procurators of Edinburgh was not regulated by the sheriff till
                    1765, and for fifteen years more they remained unincorporated. It was still
                    later before the procurators of Glasgow were erected into a corporation ; and it
                    was not till above thirty-five years ago that the procurators of Paisley were
                    incorporated.</p>
                <p>We have now a word or two to say with respect to the garb of the profession. The
                    proper habit of the bar is the long robe which now characterises the profession,
                    and which seems to have been adopted by the advocates of the College of Justice
                    as the ecclesiastical array. Anciently, however, a sort of cloak or tabard of
                    green was worn, (1455, c. 45.) which colour it will be recollected, was
                    symbolical of learning amongst the ancient Britons ; and accordingly that class
                    of their priesthood called <hi rend="italic">Ovats,</hi> and who professed the
                    liberal arts, wore habits of green. In the burgh court of Edinburgh the cloak
                    was worn till the beginning of the seventeenth century, when the procurators
                    were required to wear gowns instead.</p>
                <p>It remains to advert shortly to the executive officers of the law. These are,
                    properly speaking, the sheriffs in their respective counties, and the
                    magistrates in the burghs ; and in the criminal warrants of the superior courts
                    this is clear. But the ordinary civil process of the Court of Session is exe</p>
                <p>cuted by the messengers and other officers at-arms ; and the like process of the
                    sheriff and bailie courts is executed by the sheriff and burgh officers
                    respectively. The messengers- at-arms amount to upwards of two hundred in
                    number, and are distributed throughout the different shires and districts of the
                    kingdom. They are all associated, however, under the Lyon herald, king of arms,
                    who, as head of the office or college of arms, has authority and jurisdiction
                    over all the members and officers of the establishment. In this respect the Lord
                    Lyon may be regarded as essentially at the head of the civil branch of the
                    executive department of the law ; and accordingly it might deserve consideration
                    whether it would not be expedient, with a view at once to give unity of
                    management to the entire department, and also to relieve the sheriff of all but
                    judicial duties, to devolve upon the Lord Lyon and his officers the execution of
                    process of every kind, and the whole ministerial powers of the sheriff, in as
                    far as these are executive, or auxiliary to the courts of law.</p>
                <p>In order to give a clear and concise view of the manner in which justice is
                    distributed throughout Scotland by means of the circuit courts of justiciary,
                    and the courts of the sheriffs- depute and sheriffs-substitute, not including
                    the burgh and justice of peace courts, the following Tables are subjoined.</p>
                <p>The great divisions of the realm in early times were Lothian, Galloway, and
                    Scotland. In the first of these, justice- ayres were holden at Edinburgh,
                    Peebles, and soon afterwards Glasgow ; and if we credit the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Reg. Mag.</hi> lib. ii, c. 20, the <hi rend="italic">loca capitalia
                        Scotiœ</hi> were, Scone for Gowry, Cluny for Stormonth, Rait for Athole,
                    Dalguish for Fife, Perth for Strathearn, Forfar for Angus, Aberdeen for Mar and
                    Buchan, and Inverness for Ross and Moray. The judicial districts assigned by
                    king Edward I., in 1305, were Lothian, Galloway, beyond the Forth to the
                    Grampians, and beyond the Grampians. At the institution of the Court of Session
                    in 1532, the realm was divided, for the purposes of civil judicature, into four
                    quarters, as follows :—</p>
                <p>Forfar, Kincardine, Aberdeen, Banff, Elgin, Forres, Naim, Inverness,
                    Cromarty.</p>
                <p>Edinburgh, Haddington, Linlithgow, Berwick, Roxburgh, Peebles, Selkirk,</p>
                <p>Dumfries, Annandale, Kirkcudbright, Ayr, Wigton, Lanark, Renfrew, Stirling,</p>
                <p>Dunbarton, Argyle, Bute, Clackmannan, Kinross, Fife,</p>
                <p>Perth.</p>
                <p>By 1587, c. 82, the realm was divided, for the purposes of criminal judicature,
                    into four quarters, of seven shires each, but these are not stated.</p>

                <p>The divisions which are recognized under this head are counties or shires, and
                    parishes. Of the <hi rend="italic">counties,</hi> the origin of which is very
                    ancient, and has not been ascertained, a list, and other particulars respecting
                    them, have already been given. They are thirty-three in number, but most of them
                    are subdivided by local acts of parliament into two or more districts, for the
                    purpose of police and internal economy ; and several of them comprehend a
                    variety of territorial divisions, founded on the natural circumstances of the
                    country. Thus the county of Berwick is popularly divided into the three
                    districts of the Merse, Lauderdale, and Lammermuir ; Lanarkshire into the upper,
                    middle, and lower wards ; Ayrshire into Kyle, Cunningham, and Carrick ; and in
                    the extensive Highland counties, the subdivisions are still more numerous. There
                    is no trace in Scotland of the minor divisions of the English counties, called
                    hundreds, wapentakes, and the like. Of the judicial divisions of Scotland an
                    account will be found in this article under the head of Judicial Establishments.
                    Respecting the date of the erection of <hi rend="italic">parishes,</hi> there
                    have been various conjectures. They were purely an ecclesiastical regulation,
                    and could not have been formed till the Christian system had been generally
                    received, and its preachers become numerous ; and as this division, and the
                    necessary previous ecclesiastical establishment, infer no inconsiderable degree
                    of civilization, it is highly probable that it did</p>
                <p>not take place before the ninth or the tenth century.<note anchored="true" n="44"

                    Chalmers supposes that parishes were gradually formed after the year 843 ; but
                    that they existed in the time of Malcolm III., who died in 1093, is ascertained
                    by authentic records.<note anchored="true" n="45" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>* Caledonia, vol. i. p. 23.</p></note> The number of
                    parishes has not been uniform. Previously to the Reformation the bishops
                    possessed the power of uniting or disjoining parishes. Between this period and
                    the Union, in 1707, the authority was transferred from the bishops and vested in
                    several successive commissions of the Scottish parliament. In 1707, parliament
                    vested this power in the Court of Session, but confined the power of the court
                    to cases where consent had previously been given by persons possessing
                    three-fourths of the valued rental of the parish ; and this is the existing law.
                    The disjoining or union of parishes is, therefore, attended with considerable
                    difficulty, and very rarely takes place, except in cities where the consent of
                    the municipal authorities, if patrons of the parish, and of the presbytery of
                    the bounds, is sufficient for the purpose. Hence in Edinburgh five new parishes
                    have been erected out of the parish of St. Cuthbert’s, within the last forty
                    years. The number of parishes is at present 916, exclusive of what arc commonly
                    called <hi rend="italic">quoad sacra</hi> parishes. These latter parishes have
                    been formed in either of the two following ways. First, owing to the
                    inconvenient extent of parishes in the Highlands, and the consequent distance of
                    many of the people from the parish church, missionaries<pb
                        facs="chi.28490931-1526160593_Page_828.jpf" xml:id="eb07-19-s01-0763"/>
                    supported by a royal grant, were appointed to certain localities with the
                    privileges <hi rend="italic">quoad spiritualia</hi> of parochial clergymen,
                    except that they could not be constituent members of any of the church courts,
                    and could not even have sessions of their own. But in the year 1833, these
                    localities were, by an act of the General Assembly, converted into parishes <hi
                        rend="italic">quoad sacra,</hi> and their ministers declared to be
                    constituent members of the ecclesiastical courts. The number of these new
                    parishes is forty-one. Secondly, from the many difficulties attending the
                    erection of new parishes, means have been introduced, in addition to the
                    establishment of the new <hi rend="italic">quoad sacra</hi> parishes referred
                    to, to supersede the necessity of such a step ; and this object was accomplished
                    by the institution of “ chapels of ease,” or subsidiary places of worship,
                    without any assigned locality. These parishes, the first of which was erected in
                    1798, amounted in 1834 to sixty-six, when the General Assembly conferred on them
                    the same rights and privileges which belong to parish ministers, and appointed
                    them a certain defined locality <hi rend="italic">quoad sacra.</hi> Since that
                    period they have greatly increased in number, and are yearly increasing, so that
                    it would be both difficult and unnecessary to ascertain the exact amount. But
                    they do not affect the original parishes in any way, except in regard to the
                    spiritualities.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Church of Scotland.</hi> The reformation from popery began at
                    an early period in Scotland, but was not triumphant until the year 1560, when
                    popery was abolished, and the protestant religion established by act of
                    parliament in its stead. But whilst popery was abolished, the protestants could
                    not agree amongst themselves as to the system of ecclesiastical polity which
                    should be established in its place. Episcopacy, or the government of the church
                    by bishops, received the support of the king and of many of the most powerful
                    families; whilst presbytery, or the polity introduced by Knox from Geneva, where
                    he had studied under Calvin, was embraced by the great body of the people. But
                    amidst the struggle for pre-eminence, the presbyterians, who constituted
                    five-sixths of the protestant population, took matters into their own hand, and
                    embodied their ecclesiastical system in a work entitled <hi rend="italic">The
                        Second Book of Discipline,</hi><note anchored="true" n="46" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                                >First Book of Discipline</hi> was presented by the reformers to the
                            parliament of 1560, which abolished popery ; but it was not ratified by
                            the legislature, though it was subscribed by a great many of its members
                            as private individuals. But the parliament, though it did not give the
                            sanction of its authority to <hi rend="italic">The First Book of
                                Discipline,</hi> accepted and confirmed the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Confession of Faith</hi> drawn up by the protestants, the object of

                            to abjure popery ; and hence it is called the <hi rend="italic">Negative
                                Confession.</hi> Another <hi rend="italic">Confession of Faith,</hi>
                            or <hi rend="italic">National Covenant,</hi> as it was called, was drawn
                            up in 1580, and subscribed by the king, his household, and by persons of
                            all ranks in the state, but not confirmed by parliament. (Knox’s History

                    ecclesiastical law, and which has ever since formed the basis of the polity of
                    the established presbyterian church of Scotland. This Assembly first divided the
                    country into presbyteries and Synods.<note anchored="true" n="47" place="bottom"

                <p>But whilst presbytery was thus the religion of the people, it did not receive the
                    sanction either of the Privy Council or Parliament. On the contrary, in 1584,
                    episcopacy was established as the national church ; presbytery was declared
                    illegal ; and the presbyterian clergy were exposed to much obloquy and
                    persecution. But the public voice again got the ascendancy; and presbytery was
                    for the first time ratified by act of parliament, in 1592, as the national
                    church. But not being acceptable to the king and the court, this polity was
                    superseded by episcopacy in 1606; nor did it again obtain the supremacy till the
                    famous General Assembly, held at Glasgow in 1638, which abolished prelacy, and
                    restored the presbyterian form of worship. The proceedings and acts of this
                    Assembly were afterwards confirmed by the king and the parliament. But in 1660,
                    on the restoration of</p>
                <p>Charles II., presbytery was compelled again to give way to episcopacy, which
                    maintained the predominance till the Revolution. The act of William and Mary,
                    re-establishing presbytery, was passed in 1690.<note anchored="true" n="48"

                    these 27 are collegiate, that is, have each the services of two clergymen, who
                    preach alternately in the same place of worship. The whole number of parishes,
                    both civil and <hi rend="italic">quoad sacra,</hi> was, in 1836, 1023 ; so that,
                    including the collegiate charges, the whole number of clergymen is 1050.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Church Judicatories.</hi> The Kirk-session is the lowest court.
                    It is composed of the minister of the parish and the lay elders. The minister is
                    officially moderator or president of the session. This court takes cognizance of
                    cases of scandal, of the poor’s fund, and of parochial ecclesiastical
                    discipline. There is a power of appeal from the session to the presbytery, which
                    is the next court in dignity.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Presbytery</hi> is composed of a number of contiguous
                    parishes. A presbytery consists of the ministers of all the parishes within its
                    limits ; of the professor of divinity, if there be any university within its
                    bounds, and of a lay-elder from each parish. The presbytery takes young men on
                    trial as students of divinity, and candidates for licence ; ordains presentees
                    to vacant livings ; and has the superintendence of religion and education within
                    its precincts. Its decision is not final, if an appeal be lodged to the synod. A
                    presbytery generally meets monthly ; and it must necessarily meet at least twice
                    a-year. The number of presbyteries is eighty.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Synod</hi> is composed of two or more presbyteries. It
                    consists of every parish minister within its limits, and of the elders who last
                    represented the different sessions in the presbytery. There is a power of appeal
                    from the synod to the General Assembly. The number of synods is sixteen.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">General Assembly</hi> is the highest ecclesiastical court,
                    its decisions being final. It meets annually in the month of May, and sits for
                    ten successive days. It is honoured with the presence of a nobleman as
                    representative of the sovereign, under the title of Lord High Commissioner. But
                    this high functionary has no voice in the deliberations of the court; and even
                    his presence is not absolutely necessary. The Assembly, unlike the inferior
                    courts, consists of representatives from the presbyteries, royal burghs, and

                            tithes, or <hi rend="italic">teinds</hi> in Scotland, since the
                            Reformation, is involved and intricate. We need not enter on the
                            consideration of the subject here, but merely state that, at the
                            approach of the Reformation, most of the teinds, and much of the
                            property of the church were alienated, and bestowed on laymen, or
                            devolved on the crown. But to overlook the intermediate steps, the
                            greatest change which took place in the matter was in the reign of
                            Charles the First, who revoked all the ecclesiastical grants (except the
                            church lands) which had been made during the two preceding reigns. This
                            revocation having taken place, though with difficulty, it was provided
                            that the lands, except such as had been already appropriated to the
                            payment of stipend, should be valued and sold. The landholders were
                            entitled to sue for a valuation or <hi rend="italic">modus,</hi> and to
                            purchase the teinds of their own estates. To facilitate the inquiry into
                            the value of teinds, commissioners and sub-commissioners were appointed,
                            the latter of whom were enjoined to visit their several parishes, and to
                            report to the commissioners. Some of their reports, when made, were
                            sanctioned ; others have been brought forward for approval at later
                            periods. The result was, that by far the greater part of the teinds have
                            been bought up by the proprietors of the respective lands, after
                            stipends, commuted into a money payment, had been modified to the
                            clergymen, the teinds being held by these proprietors under the
                            condition of augmenting, if necessary, such stipends to the extent of
                            their value ; in other words, there are in these cases no tithes or
                            teinds, but part of the rent of the proprietors constitutes ministers’
                            stipend, and a certain additional portion, in cases where the valuation
                            is not exhausted, is still liable to augmentation of stipend. In cases
                            where no valuation has taken place, the value of the teinds is
                            calculated at one-fifth of the existing rent, and is also paid in money.
                            The body of commissioners just spoken of, continued to act from the date
                            of their appointment, to the Union in 1707, at which period the Court of
                            Session was authorised to supply their place, and to determine in all
                            cases of valuation and sale of teinds. As the commissioners had been
                            empowered to modify the stipends of the ministers, the same power was
                            transferred to the Court of Session. A clergyman is entitled, when the
                            teinds of the parish are not exhausted, to apply to the Court for an
                            augmentation of his stipend, which it is competent for that Court either
                            to grant or refuse. But, whether granted or not, twenty years must
                            elapse before such applications can be renewed. The stipend generally
                            consists of so many chalders of grain. The value of the grain is
                            determined by the <hi rend="italic">fiar</hi> prices, which are struck
                            in each county in Scotland in the month of February or March annually ;
                            and this value, which necessarily varies yearly, is then payable in
                            money. The teinds are also appropriated to the building of parish
                            churches and manses, and the keeping of them in repair. The ministers of
                            Edinburgh and Montrose are paid not by teinds, but by a local tax,
                            levied on the occupiers of houses; a circumstance that has been the
                            source, particularly in Edinburgh, of much irritation and discontent.

                    to raise such income to this minimum amount. The parishes thus assisted are
                    called bounty livings, and amount to 208.<note anchored="true" n="52"

                    presbyterians, entertaining Calvinistic opinions, and recognising the same
                    confession of faith and the same standards as the members of the established
                    church ; they abandoned that church in consequence of certain alleged errors in
                    discipline, and particularly the undue exercise of patronage, for lay-patronage
                    has always obtained, with more or less vigour in the Scottish establishment,
                    except for more than twenty years prior to 1712. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>The dissenting body next in importance to the United Associate Synod, is the
                    Relief, which was founded in 1755. The founders of this sect professed to differ
                    from the Established Church on no other point than the right of patrons to
                    appoint ministers against the inclinations of the people.<note anchored="true"

                    of dissenters and the Establishment has now become wader; while the different
                    sections of dissenters seem more disposed to union among themselves. The two
                    numerous bodies of the Secession and the Relief, are at present (1839) engaged
                    in making advances towards a union of these denominations. The Original Burgher
                    Associate Synod declined to join the coalition formed between the Burghers and
                    Antiburghers in 1820. The different congregations belonging to this sect are,
                    with few exceptions, disposed to join the Established Church; indeed, some of
                    them have already done so. There is another class of presbyterian dissenters,
                    generally called Cameronians, but who assume the title of the Reformed
                    Presbyterian Synod, who are the successors and representatives of the
                    Covenanters in the time of Charles the First and his son. This small but
                    interesting body refused to accept the settlement of Presbytery, as cstabli3hcd
                    by law in 1690, unless the king should consent to subscribe the Solemn League
                    and Covenant, and the standards of the Church. The Cameronians are, perhaps to
                    this day, the most rigid presbyterians in Scotland. But without descending into
                    particulars, the following table will afford a pretty correct view of the extent
                    and importance of the different religious bodies in Scotland.<note

                    besides, are very small ; and we do not think it probable that the dissenters
                    amount to much more than the fourth part of the whole population of Scotland,
                    assigning to the Established Church all who do not attend any dissenting place
                    of worship.</p>
                <p>The subject of education engaged the attention of the Scottish Parliament even in
                    comparatively rude times, viz. as early as the year 1494. The protestant church
                    zealously took up the subject, and many acts of the General Assembly were passed
                    in support of it. But it was not till 1616 that the Privy Council interposed and
                    passed an act in favour of parish schools; nor was it till seventeen years
                    afterwards, that this act of Council was ratified by Parliament. The disturbed
                    state of the times prevented the act from becoming operative; and it was not, in
                    truth, till some time after the Revolution, namely, in 1696, that the celebrated
                    statute of William and Mary was passed, which forms the foundation of the
                    present parochial system. The provisions of this act were immediately carried
                    into effect in most parishes; and now the system is in universal operation
                    throughout Scotland. The landowners and clergymen have it in their power,
                    according to law, to establish more than one school in a parish, if
                    circumstances seem to demand it; in which case the salary assigned to each of
                    the teachers is less than the maximum sum (L.34, 4s. 4 <hi rend="superscript">
                        1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> d.) given when there is only one
                    schoolmaster in a parish. From a Parliamentary paper,<note anchored="true"
                        n="55" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Educational Inquiry, Scotland,
                            Session 1837, vol. xlvii.</p></note> we learn, that the number of
                    parochial schools in Scotland is 1047; that the number of teachers is 1170; that
                    the aggregate amount of the salaries paid to them is L.29,642, 18s. 11 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>.; and that their
                    total income, including salaries, fees, and all other emoluments, but exclusive
                    of their dwelling-house and garden, is L.55,339, 17s. 1 <hi rend="superscript">

                    teacher. But ill-paid though the teachers be, they are, generally speaking, a
                    well educated and meritorious class of men; and the parochial system has given
                    such a stimulus to education, that the endowed schools have been found, in the
                    progress of society, to be too few to answer the demand for instruction on the
                    part of the people. Hence it appears from the same official document, that the
                    number of schools not parochial, is not less than 3995, and the number of
                    teachers 4469, being nearly four times the amount of the parochial schools and
                        teachers.<note anchored="true" n="56" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>Under the head of schools non-parochial, are included those
                            established by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge,
                            namely,</p><p>340; those founded by the General Assembly’s Education

                            congregations.</p></note> The greatest number of pupils attending the
                    parochial schools between Lady- day and Michaelmas 1833, was 71,426; and the
                    lowest number was 50,029∙ The greatest number attending the schools not
                    parochial, between the same dates, was 189,427; and the lowest number was
                    139,237. What the incomes of the non-parochial teachers may be, we have no data
                    to judge. They are pretty high in our large towns, but miserably low, perhaps
                    not above ten shillings a-week, in rural districts. Taking the average of the
                    preceding number of pupils, attending both the parochial and non-parochial
                    schools, namely, 225,061, the inference is, that 10 <hi rend="superscript">
                        1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> out of 100 of the population are at
                    school; but when we take into account the number of female seminaries, of
                    private boarding schools for boys, and children taught in private families by
                    governesses and tutors, not to mention Sabbath evening schools and classes for
                    religious instruction, we may with propriety conclude, that at least 9 <hi

                    of the population are at the same time under tuition; a larger proportion than
                    is known to be similarly situated, excepting in particular districts, in any
                    other country of Europe.</p>
                <p>The origin of the Scottish universities is not of any remote</p>
                <p>date. But as early as the year 1282, Dervorgille, wife of John Balliol, founded
                    and endowed a college at Oxford for the reception of Scottish students; and, in
                    1,326, a college, known by the name of the Scotch college, was founded and
                    endowed at Paris by David Murray, bishop of Moray, for a similar purpose.<note

                    Scotland enjoyed the advantages of universities within the limits of her own
                    territory. That of St. Andrews, the oldest in the kingdom, was founded by papal
                    authority in 1413; that of Glasgow, by the same authority, in 1450; that of
                    Aberdeen, also under the sanction of the pope, in 1494, though education did not
                    commence there till 1500; and that of Edinburgh, founded by the presbyterians,
                    in 1582. The university of St. Andrews consisted at one time of three colleges,
                    instituted at different periods, viz. St. Salvador’s, St. Leonard’s, and St.
                    Mary’s; hut in 1748, the two first were united, and the buildings of St.
                    Leonard’s were alienated and converted into dwelling-houses. The university of
                    Aberdeen consists of two colleges; King’s, founded, as just stated, in 1494; and
                    Marischal college, instituted and endowed by George Keith, Earl Marischal, in
                    1593. The universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh contain one college each; but
                    embrace all the faculties in their course of instruction. The following table
                    shews the number of professors in the different universities, with the date of
                    their foundation.</p>

                <p>When</p>
                <p>founded.</p>
                <p>Each of these universities enjoys the privilege of conferring literary honours in
                    all the faculties. The aggregate number of students attending all these
                    seminaries is about 2900, of whom about 1300 belong to the university of
                    Edinburgh ; 1100 to that of Glasgow ; and the remainder to Aberdeen and St.
                    Andrews, the attendance on the latter not exceeding 130. There are no religious
                    tests to exclude students from any of our Scottish colleges. Jews, Catholics,
                    Protestants, enjoy the same privileges. But the professors should, according to
                    law, belong to the Established Church, and are liable to be called upon to sign
                    her standards. This condition, however, is not always exacted. The session
                    extends from the beginning of November till the end of April. There are a few
                    summer classes in the universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, but these extend
                    only to three months preceding the first of August. A Royal Commission was
                    appointed in 1826 for visiting the universities and colleges of Scotland, and in
                    1830 gave in a voluminous report. Another Commission was nominated in 1836, for
                    visiting the university of Aberdeen. Their report has just been presented. But
                    though a bill was brought into Parliament in 1836, founded on the former report,
                    providing for a general board of visitors appointed by the crown over all the
                    universities, that bill was withdrawn ; and no measure on the subject has since
                    been brought forward.</p>
                <p>Though poor-rates are not generally imposed in Scotland, yet a law involving a
                    compulsory assessment for the support of the impotent poor, was passed as early
                    as the year 1576. But the very existence of such a statute seemed nearly unknown
                    till about the middle of last century. “ As long as there was no secession of
                    presbyterians from the Established Church, the weekly collections, under the<pb
                        facs="chi.28490931-1526160593_Page_831.jpf" xml:id="eb07-19-s01-0766"/>
                    management of the kirk-session, were in general found sufficient for the
                    management of the poor. In some years of peculiar hardship or scarcity, such as
                    the four last years of the seventeenth century, or the year 1740, voluntary
                    assistance was no doubt given ; and in some instances temporary assessments were
                    resorted to, to enable the kirk-sessions to meet the usual emergencies. But on
                    all ordinary occasions the resources of the kirk-sessions were considered as
                    sufficient, and continued to be so at least as late as 1755.”<note

                    assessments were reluctantly introduced, notwithstanding the existence of a law
                    in their favour, so they</p>
                <p>have spread tardily. At this moment they embrace only 236 parishes, being little
                    more than a fourth of the total parishes of Scotland. These assessments have not
                    only been introduced, but are the heaviest, in the parishes bordering on England
                    ; and with the exception of our larger towns, they decrease or disappear as we
                    recede from the infectious example of the sister kingdom. Thus every parish in
                    the synod of Merse and Teviotdale is burdened with assessment. In the midland
                    synods, less than the half of the parishes are assessed ; whilst in the northern
                    synods, embracing 157 parishes, only three are exposed to that burden.</p>

                <p>Both these institutions have long existed in Scotland, but were based till
                    recently on an insecure foundation. With the view of putting them on a sound
                    footing, the act of 10 Geo. IV., c. 56, and of 4 and 5 Will. IV., c. 40, were
                    passed. All friendly societies, claiming the benefits of these acts, are obliged
                    to submit a statement of their rules and regulations for the approval of the
                    officer appointed by government for the purpose ; and these must receive his
                    sanction ere the parties become entitled to the privileges conferred by the act
                    in question, namely, the being allowed to invest the funds of the society in
                    government securities at a minimum rate of interest (2 <hi rend="superscript">
                        1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> d. per cent. per day), and in the
                    funds of savings banks. Upwards of five hundred friendly societies have been
                    instituted on the principle of these acts. The act as to savings banks, which
                    has been in operation in all other parts of the empire since 1819, was extended
                    to Scotland in 1835. According to the provisions of this act, the money of
                    savings banks can be invested in government securities at the rate of L.3, 16s.

                    per annum. No individual can deposit more than L.30 in any one year, exclusive
                    of interest, nor more than L.200 in all. Savings banks have been established
                    under the law in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Cupar, Kirkaldy, Dunfermline, Dalkeith, and
                    other towns. The deposits in the Edinburgh institution amount to about
                    L.170,000, in rather less than 3 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> years; and the other savings banks in Scotland have
                    been equally successful.</p>
                <p>The peers of Scotland, by the treaty of union, elect sixteen of their number to
                    be their representatives in the House of Lords. This election takes place in the
                    palace of Holyrood on the dissolution of parliament. These sixteen peers, who
                    are not elected for life, as is the case with the Irish representative peers,
                    but for the continuance of the parliament for which they are chosen, enjoy all
                    the privileges of the peers of</p>
                <p>England. The other peers of Scotland have all the privileges of the House of
                    Lords, except the legislative and judicial powers, and the privileges thence
                    arising. The number of Scottish peers at the union was one hundred and
                    fifty-four; and there has been since restored five, making one hundred and
                    fifty-nine ; but the present number is eighty-three, namely, seven dukes, four
                    marquises, thirty- nine earls, three countesses, six viscounts, twenty-three
                    barons, and one baroness. Thirty-six of these are also British peers ; and two
                    are likewise peers of Ireland.</p>
                <p>Scotland, before the passing of the reform bill in the year 1832, was represented
                    in the House of Commons by forty-five members, thirty being returned by the
                    counties, and fifteen by the royal burghs, sixty-six in number. The number of
                    the Scottish representatives since the passing of the reform bill, is
                    fifty-three, thirty being, as before, chosen by the counties, whilst the burghs
                    and towns, seventy-six in number, of which ten are not royal burghs, send
                    twenty- three. The counties, thirty-three in number, return only thirty members,
                    because, for parliamentary objects, Kinross and Clackmannan, Elgin and Nairn,
                    and Ross and Cromarty, are respectively united. The aggregate number of the
                    county freeholders or voters, at the passing of the reform act, was 3211. The
                    burgh constituencies were still more limited. With the exception of Edinburgh,
                    which sent a member of itself, the other burghs were parcelled out in groups,
                    and each burgh in the group voted by a delegate chosen by the magistrates and
                    town- council., amounting, upon an average, to twenty in each, or 1320 in all.
                    The aggregate number of the county constituencies, in 1838-39, was 46,480, or
                    nearly fifteen limes the former amount ; and of the burgh constituencies,
                    36,373, or fully twenty-seven times its former extent. The total constituency of
                    Scotland is 82,853.<note anchored="true" n="61" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The amount of square miles, as stated under a previous head, being 29,600, the
                    average population is within a fraction of eighty to the square mile. Great as
                    has been the advance of population since the beginning of the last century, and
                    particularly since 1801, it has been considerably less than its progress during
                    the same period in England or Ireland. This desirable result seems to have been
                    owing principally to the consolidation of farms in the low country ; the
                    extinction of the cottier system in the Highlands, and the substitution in its
                    stead of large sheep farms ; the comparative want of poor-laws ; and the
                    obstacles interposed by the law of Scotland to the sub-letting of farms, and to
                    the subdivision of land. But however it may be accounted for, the fact is
                    certain that, as compared with the increase of wealth, the population of
                    Scotland has increased less rapidly than that of either of the two sister
                    kingdoms. The Scotch have therefore advanced much more rapidly than the English
                    or Irish in wealth, and in the command of the necessaries and conveniences of
                    life. Their progress in this respect has, indeed, been quite astonishing. The
                    habits, diet, dress, and other accommodations of the people, have been signally
                    improved. It is not too much to affirm, that the peasantry of the present day
                    are better lodged, better clothed, and better fed, than the middle class of
                    landowners were a century ago.</p>

                <p>The first boat successfully impelled by steam in Europe was the Comet, which
                    began to ply on the Clyde in 1812, and was the result of the skill and ingenuity
                    of the late Henry Bell. Nor was there more than one steam-boat in Scotland for
                    two years afterwards. In 1819, they had increased to 11 ; in 1830, to 61 ; and
                    in 1837, to 109, (tonnage, 13,368), of which 63, or considerably more than the
                    half, belonged to the Clyde.<note anchored="true" n="65" place="bottom"

                <p>On the subject of the Scottish manufactures our notices, derived from official or
                    other documents, shall be brief, particularly as under the articles <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Dundee, Glasgow,</hi> &amp;c., we have already given pretty
                    ample information on the different manufactures for which the country is
                    distinguished. The linen manufacture was the earliest, and long regarded as the
                    staple, branch of industry carried on in Scotland. But such were the narrow
                    limits within which it was confined, that, at the Union, in 1707, it was not
                    supposed to exceed 1,500,000 yards a-year. In 1727, aboard of trustees was
                    established for the superintendence and encouragement of the linen manufacture ;
                    and bounties and premiums were given on its production and exportation.</p>
                <p>The regulations as to the inspection and stamping of the linen intended for
                    exportation, by which the trade was much annoyed, were abolished in 1822; and
                    the bounties ceased in the year 1830. The quantity produced for sale in 1728 was
                    2,000,000 yards; in 1775, 12,000,000 yards ; in 1822, 36,000,000 yards ; and the
                    exports alone, in 1835, exclusive of home consumption, was between 60,000,000
                    and 70,000,000 yards, worth about L.l,600,000. Dundee and the east of Scotland,
                    including Fifeshire, are the great seats of the manufacture, particularly in
                    Osnaburghs, sail-cloth, and the coarser fabrics; and Dunfermline and the
                    neighbouring towns and villages, the principal seat of damask, diaper, and the
                    finer fabrics. Previously to 1791, all the yarn used in the manufacture was spun
                    upon the common hand-wheel ; but the spinning by machinery began at that time to
                    be introduced ; and such has been the facility of production consequent on the
                    erection of flax-mills, that the cost of the yarn, including the raw material,
                    is now less than the spinning amounted to thirty years ago. The number of flax,
                    hemp, and tow factories was, in 1837, 175, employing no fewer than 15,462
                    workers, of whom 4231 were between thirteen and eighteen years of age, and 163
                    between nine and thirteen.</p>
                <p>Lanarkshire, which includes the city of Glasgow, and also the contiguous county
                    of Renfrew, has always been the principal seat of the cotton manufacture. Some
                    of the fabrics made at Glasgow and Paisley are of almost unrivalled beauty and
                    fineness. The first steam-engine for the spinning of cotton erected in Scotland,
                    was constructed so late as 1792. The number of cotton factories in 1837 was 177,
                    all those of considerable size being situated at Glasgow, and in the
                    neighbouring districts, comprehending twenty or thirty miles around Glasgow,
                    excepting five in Aberdeenshire, two in Perthshire, one in Dumfries-shire, and
                    one at Gatehouse, in Kirkcudbrightshire. But, with no exception, all these
                    country mills are connected with Glasgow houses, or the Glasgow trade, at least
                    so far as the raw material is concerned. The number of hands from eight years of
                    age upwards employed in the Scottish cotton manufacture, is 34,418, of whom
                    13,567 are between thirteen and eighteen years of age, and 1096 between nine and
                    thirteen.</p>
                <p>The woollen manufacture of Scotland has never been considerable. It was formerly
                    the custom for the occupiers of land in this country to spin the whole of their
                    wool with the hand in their own houses, and to send the yarn to the village
                    weaver to be woven into a species of coarse cloth called <hi rend="italic"
                        >plaiding ;</hi> but this mode, which is indicative of a rude and backward
                    state of society, is now entirely abandoned, having been superseded by
                    machinery. Factories for the making of fine cloth have been established in
                    Aberdeenshire, and in some other counties ; but comparatively coarse fabrics
                    still continue to be the staple article of Scotch manufacture. The number of
                    woollen or worsted factories in 1837 was 104, situated chiefly at Aberdeen, in
                    Clackmannanshire, at Hawick, Galashiels, and Jedburgh, Roxburghshire, and in the
                    counties of Stirling, Argyle, and Inverness. Hawick has almost entirely
                    withdrawn from this species of manufacture, and devotes its energies principally
                    to the production of woollen hose, of which it annually produces about 500,000
                    pairs, with blankets, and flannels. The towns of Stirling and Bannockburn are
                    almost the exclusive seat of tartans. Kilmarnock is chiefly celebrated for its
                    manufacture of carpets and shawls, besides large numbers of night-caps, bonnets,
                    and foraging caps for the army. Bonnets in Scotland, however, have been pretty
                    generally superseded by hats. The woollen factories, in 1837, contained 4339
                    workers, of whom 1856 were between thirteen and eighteen years of age, and 156
                    between nine and thirteen.<pb facs="chi.28490931-1526160593_Page_834.jpf"
                        xml:id="eb07-19-s01-0769"/> The silk manufacture in Scotland is still less
                    considerable than that of woollen. The principal seats of it are at Paisley,
                    Glasgow, and Edinburgh. Broad silks, or manufactured goods of entire silk, sold
                    by the yard, viz. gauzes, Persians, satins, and, in general, all broad silks,
                    plain or figured, are made at these places, particularly the two first. Silk
                    mills were established in Edinburgh so late as the year 1838. Handkerchiefs,
                    such as Bandanas and Barcelonas, are made at Paisley and Glasgow, and a few
                    adjacent places in connexion with these towns. Paisley is celebrated for “ mixed
                    goods,” that is, all varieties of manufacture in which silk forms a component
                    part. Edinburgh is eminent chiefly for its shawls of the finest fabrics, but
                    perhaps is surpassed even in this its staple silk production by Paisley. The
                    silk factories contain about 1000 workers. The whole of the factories, of all
                    kinds, in Scotland, namely, those of linen, cotton, woollen, and silk, amounted,
                    in 1837, to 462, (of which 102 are situated in Lanarkshire, 94 in Forfarshire,
                    including Dundee, Arbroath, and other manufacturing towns, and 62 in
                    Renfrewshire,) employing 55,159 persons ; but the number of both has increased
                    considerably since that time.</p>
                <p>Soap has long been manufactured to a very great extent in Scotland ; and the
                    principal seats of the manufacture are Glasgow, Leith, Paisley, Aberdeen,
                    Prestonpans, and Montrose. The quantity made, in 1837, was 12,958,856 lbs., viz.
                    of hard soap, 9,553,855, and of soft, 3,4050,01. The</p>
                <p>quantity exported was 450,956 lbs., the rest being retained or home consumption.
                    The number of licences issued to soapmakers was twenty-one.</p>
                <p>The quantity of whisky produced in Scotland cannot be ascertained before the year
                    1823, because, previously to that time, owing to the high rate of duty, (5s. 6d.
                    per English wine gallon,) smuggling prevailed to a great extent in almost every
                    district of the country, particularly in the Highlands. But in 1823 the duty was
                    reduced to 2s., though subsequently, namely, in 1826 and 1830, it has been
                    successively raised to 2s. 10d. and 3s. 4d. The following table will shew the
                    quantity that paid duty for home consumption since that time :</p>

                <p>The principal seat of this manufacture is Edinburgh and its neighbourhood ; but
                    it prevails extensively in other places. By the following statement it appears
                    that the quantity of strong ale brewed on an average of five years previous to
                    1830, was 119,551 barrels annually, (the duty being 9s. 10d. per barrel,) and of
                    table beer, on an average of the same time, 250,698 barrels, the duty being 1s.

                    being repealed in 1830, there are no later accounts of the quantity breweιl. The
                    duty on malt is 20s. 8d. per quarter, and on hops 2d. per lb. The following

                <p>The manufacture of kelp, which was formed by the incineration of the common
                    sea-wrack, has altogether ceased ; but during the late war it was prosecuted to
                    such an extent, particularly on the shores of the Highlands and Islands, that
                    the total amount produced in Scotland was about 20,000 tons, which usually
                    brought about L.10 per ton, or L.200,000 yearly. At some periods it brought
                    L.20, at others it was as low as L.4 per ton. But since the reduction of the
                    duty on barilla and salt, the manufacture has altogether ceased.</p>
                <p>Scotland has long been famous for its fisheries, which were fora time the subject
                    of bounties and premiums on the part of government ; but it is questionable
                    whether such factitious encouragement was productive of any real or permanent
                    good. Boards for protecting, extending, and encouraging the fisheries were
                    instituted in 1749, 1786, and 1808. But all bounties and premiums have now
                    ceased ; and the branch of industry in question is now thriving at least as well
                    as when encumbered with factitious aid. The salmon fishery of Scotland has long
                    been very considerable. The fishery in the Tweed is the most important, not only
                    in Scotland, but in the empire, though there has of late years been a great
                    decline in the quantity caught. About the end of the late war, the Tweed fishery
                    yielded a rental of from L.15,000 to L.18,000 a-year ; but owing to the falling
                    off in the quantity caught, it does not now yield above L.4000 a-year. In
                    addition to the Tweed, the other most valuable salmon fisheries are in the
                    Forth, Tay, Dee, Don, Findhorn, Spey, Ness, Conon, and other rivers throughout
                    Scotland. The London market is supplied with salmon chiefly by Scotland. The
                    total value of the salmon caught in Scotland has been estimated at L.150,000
                        a-year.<note anchored="true" n="66" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    1st of February. In the Tweed and its tributary streams, the taking of salmon
                    with the net is prohibited between the 15th of October and 15th February, or
                    with the rod between 7th of November and 15th February. The Solway fisheries,
                    according to the act of Parliament, include all streams that fall into the
                    Solway Firth, embracing the Piltanton, the Luce, and the Bladenoch in
                    Wigtonshire ; the Cree, Fleet, Dee, and Urr in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright ;
                    as well as the Nith and other rivers in Dumfries-shire. The close season with
                    all of these rivers begins on the 25th of September, and terminates with
                    Piltanton, Luce, Bladenoch, and Cree, as early as the 3lst of December ; with

                    <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> The herring fishery has long been extensively
                    cultivated, and much capital has been invested in it. The chief seat is the east
                    of Scotland, of which Wick, and its suburb, Pultneytown, in Caithness, are
                    important stations. Pultneytown, indeed, has, owing to this circumstance, grown
                    up with something like the rapidity of a manufacturing village. During the
                    fishing season, from 1500 to 2000 boats, each averaging a crew of five men,
                    rendezvous here. Of these about 500 belong to the town ; the rest resort thither
                    from all quarters of the kingdom. Of 436,098 barrels of herring cured in the
                    year ending the 5th of April 1834, no fewer than 134,738, or between a third and
                    a fourth of the whole, were cured at Wick. The following table contains an
                    account of the total number of barrels of herring which were cured in Scotland
                    in the year just referred to, distinguishing the stations where landed or

                <p>About an eighth part of the whole was cured at sea, and the remainder on shore.
                    About the same proportion was cured ungutted ; the rest were gutted, and
                    generally within twenty-four hours after the fish were caught. In addition to
                    the herring, the Scottish coast abounds with various kinds of white fish, such
                    as haddock, cod, ling, and the like, as also oysters, flounders, and other flat
                    fish. the persons who carry on the white fishing reside in the sea-ports, or the
                    numerous villages on the coast. They use lines and nets, but principally the
                    former ; and their business can be carried on throughout the year. Steam
                    navigation gives them a readier and a wider command of a market than they
                    formerly enjoyed. In 1834 the herring, cod, and ling fisheries employed 9,263
                    boats, decked and undecked, 48,700 fishermen and boys by whom the boats were
                    manned, 1893 coopers, and 28,645 in gutting, packing, &amp;c ; the total number
                    of persons employed in these fisheries being 79,238.</p>
                <p>This article would not be complete if it did not refer, however briefly, to the
                    system of banking for which Scotland has become so celebrated. The Scottish
                    banks are joint-stock establishments with large constituencies, the National
                    bank having no fewer than 1238 partners, and the North of Scotland bank 1418;
                    and, except in the case of</p>
                <p>chartered banks, each partner is responsible to the extent of his private
                    fortune. With the chartered banks the responsibility is limited ; but then the
                    charter guarantees a certain amount of capital. For example, the capital of the
                    bank of Scotland is L.1,500,000, for which sum the shareholders are responsible;
                    and of it two-thirds, or L. 1,000,000, has been actually paid up. These
                    establishments, consisting of extensive constituencies, whose responsibility is
                    unlimited, or, if chartered, possessing large capitals paid up or guaranteed,
                    enjoy the perfect confidence of the public. Besides, they are severally under
                    the management of a body of Directors chosen by the partners out of their own
                    body, and directly and periodically responsible to their constituents ; and
                    under their superintendence the banking business is carried on in these
                    establishments on the most judicious and approved principles. Nor is this all.
                    The different banks periodically exchange notes with each other ; in Edinburgh,
                    twice weekly, and in the country generally once a- week. Over-issuing is thus
                    completely checked, for if any one bank has, after an exchange is made, an
                    overplus of the notes of any other, this latter must redeem those notes either
                    by a payment in specie, or in Exchequer bills, or an order on the bank of
                    England. For any of these institutions to become insolvent or bankrupt seems
                    next to be impossible. Indeed, no joint-stock bank, of any importance, ever did
                    become insolvent ; but in cases when, in provincial towns, such banks have
                    suspended payment, (which has happened only in a very few instances, and these
                    originating in ignorance or fraud,) the public, or the holders of their notes,
                    have suffered no loss, each partner being responsible to the amount of his
                    private fortune. The Scotch banks receive sums as low as L.10, or sometimes
                    lower, as deposits, and allow interest on them at about one, or one and a half
                    per cent. below the market rate. The system of “cash accounts” is peculiar to
                    the Scottish mode of banking. A cash account is a credit given by a bank to an
                    individual with two or more collateral securities, for a certain sum, which he
                    may draw out wholly or partially as he pleases, replacing it in the same way,
                    being charged interest only on the portion he withdraws. The act prohibiting the
                    circulation of small notes in England did not extend to Scotland ; so that the
                    currency consists almost exclusively of papcr, namely, notes of the value of L.1
                    and upwards, Indeed, there is very little gold in circulation. The Scotch banks
                    draw on London at twenty days date. The Bank of Scotland, the oldest banking
                    establishment in Scotland, was established in 1695, and issued notes for L.1 as
                    early as 1704. The Royal Bank of Scotland was founded in 1727 and the British
                    Linen Company in 1746. The total number of joint-stock banks at present in
                    Scotland is 25, having altogether 306 branches. There are also seven private
                    banking establishments. The aggregate amount of the sums deposited in the
                    different Scottish banks was calculated to be in 1826 about L.20,000,000 or
                    L.21,000,000 ; and it must have since increased considerably. The circulatior is
                    supposed to be between L.3,000,000 and L.4,000,000 seldom exceeding the latter
                        sum.<note anchored="true" n="68" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>* House
