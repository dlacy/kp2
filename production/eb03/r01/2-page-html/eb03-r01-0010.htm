<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr Derhatn accounted for the precipitation of the drops of ram from the </span><span class="font0">veficulæ being </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">full of air, and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">meeting with </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font0">air colder than they contained, the&nbsp;air they contained was of conſequence contracted into&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">fmaller ſpace ; and conſequently the watery ſhell rendered thicker, and thus ſpecifically heavier, than the&nbsp;common atmoſphere. But it has been ſhown, that&nbsp;the veficulæ, if ſuch they are, of vapour, are not ſilled with air, but with ſire, or heat ; and conſequent-ly, till they part with this latent heat, the vapour can-not be condenſtd §. Now, cold is not always ſufficient&nbsp;to effect this, ſince in the moſt ſevere froſts the air is&nbsp;very often ſerene, and parts with little or none of its va-pour for a very conſiderable time. Neither can we admit&nbsp;the winds to have any conſiderable agency in this matter, ſince we ſind that blowing upon vapour is ſo far&nbsp;from condenſing it, that it unites it more cloſely with&nbsp;the air, and wind is found to be a great promoter of&nbsp;evaporation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">According to Rohault, the great cauſe of rain is the heat of the air ; which, after continuing for ſome time&nbsp;near the earth, is raiſed on high by a wind, and there&nbsp;thawing the ſnowy villi or flocks of half-frozen veficulæ, reduces them to drops ; which, coaleſcing, de-ſcend. Here, however, we ought to be informed by&nbsp;what means theſe veficulæ are ſuſpended in their half-frozen ſtate ; fince the thawing of them can make but&nbsp;little difference in their ſpeciſic gravity, and it is cer-tain that they afcended through the air not in a fro-zen but in an aqueous ſtate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Dr Clarke and others afcribe this defcent of the rain rather to an alteration of the atmoſphere than of the&nbsp;veficulæ ; and ſuppoſe it to ariſe from a diminution of&nbsp;the elaſtic force of the air. This elaſticity, which,&nbsp;they ſay, depends chiefly or wholly upon terrene exhalations, being weakened, the atmofphere links under its burden, and the clouds fall. Now, the little&nbsp;veſicles being once upon the deſcent, will continue there-in, notwithſtanding the increaſe of reſiſtance they <sub>j&nbsp;</sub>every moment meet with. For, as they all tend to the&nbsp;centre of the earth, the farther they fall, the more&nbsp;coalitions they will make ; and the more coalitions,&nbsp;rhe more matter will there be under the ſame ſurface ; the furface increafing only as the ſquares, but&nbsp;the ſolidity as the cubes ; and the more matter under&nbsp;the ſame furface, the leſs reſiſtance will there be to the&nbsp;fame matter. Thus, if the cold, wind, &amp;c. act early&nbsp;enough to precipitate the aſcending veſicles before they&nbsp;are arrived at any conſiderable height, the coalitions&nbsp;being but few, the drops will be proportionably ſmall ;&nbsp;and thus is formed a dew. If the vapours be more copious, and riſe a little higher, we have a miſt or fog.&nbsp;A little higher ſtill, and they produce a ſmall ιain ; if&nbsp;they neither meet with cold nor wind, they form a&nbsp;heavy thick dark ſky. This hypotheſis is equally unſatisfactory with the' others ; for, granting that the de-ſcent and condenſation of the vapours are owing to a diminution of the atmofphere’s elaſticity, by what is this&nbsp;diminution occaſioned ? To fay that it is owing to ter-rene exhalations, is only ſolving one difficulty by another ; ſince we are totally unacquainted both with the&nbsp;mature and operation of theſe exhalations. Beſides,&nbsp;let us ſuppoſe the cauſe to be what it will, if it acts&nbsp;equally and at once upon all the vapour in the air, then&nbsp;ail that vapour muſt be precipitated at once ; and thus,&nbsp;inſtead of gentle ſhowers continuing for a confiderable&nbsp;length of time, we ſhould have the moſt violent water-ſpouts, continuing only for a few minutes, or perhaps&nbsp;ſeconds, which, inſtead of refreſhing the earth, would&nbsp;drown and lay waſte every thing before them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since philoſophers have admitted the electric fluid to ſuch a large ſhare in the operations of nature, al-moſt all the natural phenomena have been accounted&nbsp;for by the action of that fluid ; and rain, among others,&nbsp;has been reckoned an effect of electricity. But this&nbsp;word, unleſs it is explained, makes us no wiſer .than&nbsp;we were before ; the phenomena of artificial electricity&nbsp;having been explained on principles which could ſcarce&nbsp;apply in any degree to the electricity of nature : and&nbsp;therefore all the ſolution we can obtain of the natural&nbsp;appearances of which we ſpeak, comes to this, that rain&nbsp;is occaſioned by a moderate electrification, hail and ſnow&nbsp;by one more violent, and thunder by the moſt violent&nbsp;of all ; but in what manner this electrification is occa-ſioned, hath not yet been explained. Throughout the&nbsp;various parts of this work where electricity hath been&nbsp;occafionally mentioned, the principles of artificial electricity </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">j∣, </span><span class="font0">laid down in the treatiſe appropriated to that&nbsp;ſubject, have been applied to the ſolution ot the phenomena of nature ; thoſe which are necefl’ary to be attend-ed to here are the following :</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">The electric fluid and ſolar light are the ſame&nbsp;fubſtance in two different modifications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electricity is the motion of the fluid when running,&nbsp;or attempting to run, in a continued ſtream from one&nbsp;place to another : heat is when the fluid has no tendency but to vibrate outwards and inwards to and from&nbsp;a centre ; or at leaſt when its ſtreams converge to a&nbsp;point or focus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fluid acting as electricity, like water, or any&nbsp;other fluid, always tends to the place where there is&nbsp;leaſt reſiſtance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Οη theſe three principles may the phenomena of at-moſpherical electricity, and the deſcent of rain by its means, be explained as follows :</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">i The light or heat of thc ſun, acting in that pe-cüliar manner which we call </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">heat,</span><span class="font0"> unites itſelf with the moiſture of the earth, and forms it into vapour,&nbsp;which thus becomes ſpecifically lighter than air, and&nbsp;of conlequence aſcends in the atmoſphere to a certain&nbsp;height.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Befides the quantity of light which is thus united to the water, and forms it into vapour, a very con-fiderable quantity enters the earth, where it affumes&nbsp;the nature of electric fluid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the earth is always full of that fluid, every&nbsp;quantity which enters muſt difplace an equal quantity&nbsp;which is already there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This quantity which is difplaced muſt eſcape ei-ther at a diitance from the place where the other en-ters, or very near it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At whatever place a quantity of electric matter&nbsp;eſcapes, it muſt electrify the air above that place&nbsp;where it has eſcaped ; and as a confiderable quantity&nbsp;of light muſt always be reflected from the earth into&nbsp;the atmoſphere, where it does not combine with the&nbsp;aqueous vapour, we have thence another ſource of&nbsp;electricity to the air ; as this quantity muſt undoubt-edly affume the action of electric fluid, elpecially after the action of the ſun has ceaſed. Hence the rea-</span></p>
