            <p>xvii. and xliv. in “ Papianus ” ; chap. xx. as chap. cvi. (extravagant) and its
                remaining chapters as chapters lxxxix. to cv. The second additamentum is placed as
                chap, cvii., the old chap, lxxxix. as chap, cviii., and a new chapter cix. (a decree
                of Sigismund “ De collectis” of 516) added. It was Gundobald’s intention that his
                law should decide all cases between Burgundians and between them and Romans ; in all
                other cases the latter would only use Roman law (comp, second preface), of which the
                Lex Burgundionum contains many traces, and even the Burgundians were allowed to use
                Roman law (comp. L. Burg., titt. 43, 60, 55 § 2). The Latinity of the Burgundian Law
                is purer than that of all the preceding barbarian codes, and we find in it a
                distinct tendency to treat Romans with greater leniency and to make them equal to
                the Burgundians in the eye of the law. Through Gundobald’s political relations with
                Alaric II., the Lex Burgundionum influenced the West-Gothic legislation, of which
                traces are found in the Lex Wisigothorum and the interpretatio to Alaric’s
                Breviarium. Charlemagne promulgated in 813 a Capitulare Aquisgranum (<hi
                    rend="italic">Mom</hi>., Legg., i. 817) regarding the Lex Burgundionum, though
                the text was not altered. Agobart, bishop of Lyons, complained to Louis the Pious
                respecting certain abuses caused by the Burgundian Law (Bouquet, vi. 356), but no
                remedy was effected. On the other hand, towards the end of the 9th century the law
                had gradually fallen into disuse like all the other barbarian laws, though it is
                said that the emperor Conrad II. revived and confirmed it. See, besides Professor
                Bluhme’s edition, Hube, <hi rend="italic">Hist. de la formation de la loi
                    Bourguignonne, </hi>Paris, 1867.</p>
            <p>(10a) In the second preface to the Lex Burgundionum (published in 502) the Roman
                subjects of the Burgundian king were promised a codification of their own laws. This
                work appears to have been promptly executed and was published under the title <hi
                    rend="italic">Lex Romana Burgundionum,</hi> perhaps before the compilation of
                the Breviarium Alarici (506). This collection is also known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Papianus,</hi> of which name (found already in MSS. of the 9th century) no
                satisfactory explanation has hitherto been offered, some, perhaps wrongly, supposing
                that it is a corruption of the name of Papinianus, the Roman jurist. It was
                published by Professor Bluhme as an appendix to the Lex Burgundionum (<hi
                    rend="italic">Mon</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Germ. Hist.,</hi> Legg., iii. p. 579). </p>
            <p>(11) As regards the <hi rend="italic">Lex Wisigothorum</hi> (also called <hi
                    rend="italic">Forum Judicum, Judicum Liber, Forum Judiciale,</hi> &amp;c.), we
                know with certainty from Isidore of Seville <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Goth.
                    Hisp.,</hi> 504) that Euric (466-483) was the first Gothic king who gave written
                laws to the West Goths. It would therefore be erroneous to ascribe (with Mariana,
                    <hi rend="italic">Hist. de España,</hi> v. 6) their first written laws to
                Euric’s son, Alaric II., though it seems probable that the latter, by adding his own
                laws to those of his father, was really the first author of a West-Gothic
                codification. Isidore refers to the collection of laws (as it had been preserved up
                to the end of the 5th and the beginning of the 6th century) as the Laws of Euric,
                though we must assume that the statutes of the kings who succeeded Euric had already
                been added to his collection. Isidore also tells us <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Goth.
                    Hisp.,</hi> 606-624) that Leovigild (d. 586) revised Euric’s Laws. As Isidore
                was bishop of Seville from 599 to 636, and may therefore be said to have been a
                contemporary of Leovigild, his testimony may be accepted as conclusive, though a
                much later but untrustworthy tradition would have it that the revision was executed
                by Leovigild’s son, Reccared I. (the first Catholic king of the Goths), who died in
                601, whereby the whole population of Spain was equalized in point of law. According
                to Spanish traditions of the 12th century, the West-Gothic collection of laws was
                again revised, under Sisenand, by the fourth council of Toledo (633), a revision on
                which Isidore seems to have exercised some influence. It is uncertain, however,
                whether the code was then systematically arranged and divided into twelve books, as
                we now have it, or whether this was done under Chindaswinth (d. 652) or under his
                son Receswinth (d. 672). The several books of the code are divided (in imitation of
                the codes of Theodosius and Justinianus) into tituli, and those again into chapters
                or constitutions. From Leovigild down to Egica (d. 701) and his son and coregent
                Witiza (d. c. 701, the last king of the Goths before the invasion of the Moors)
                every constitution bears the name of the king who promulgated it, while those dating
                from before Leovigild have the word “antiqua” prefixed to them instead of the name
                of a king. This designation is said to have been commenced by Erwig (680-687), who
                thereby wished to prevent the clergy from claiming the code as their work. Of the
                texts which existed before the fourth council of Toledo only one small fragment has
                come down to us, in a palimpsest preserved in the Paris National Library (No. 1278).
                Some regard this as the remainder of the supposed recension of Reccared I. ; others
                regard it as a fragment of the Laws of Euric, though it could in no case be the Laws
                of Euric themselves, but at most their codification by Alaric II. The fragment was
                known to the Benedictines <hi rend="italic">(Nouv. Traité de Diplom.,</hi> i. 483,
                iii. 52, 152, note 1), and was published in 1847 by Professor Bluhme <hi
                    rend="italic">(Die Westgoth. Antiqua oder das Gesctzbuch Reccared's I.,</hi>
                Halle). The text is undoubtedly older than those enactments which we find designated
                as “antiqua,” so that it could hardly be placed later than the commencement of
                the</p>
            <p>6th century, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> shortly after the compilation of the
                Breviarium Alarici (506). Hence the text called “antiqua” may be regarded as a
                modification of that of the Paris palimpsest, and was probably not made before the
                end of the 6th or the beginning of the 7th century. Roman law, which is so
                conspicuous in the later text, may already be traced in that of the palimpsest
                (taken from the Breviarium Alarici), and also in the “antiqua” constitutions, in
                which we find even traces of Justinian’s law. The Lex Wisigothorum (the first code
                in which Roman law and Teutonic law were systematically combined) was no doubt
                regarded, after Leovigild and Reccared I., as a code for the Goths as well as for
                the Romans, without abolishing the Breviarium among the Romans. But King
                Chindaswinth ordained that the Lex Wisigothorum should be the sole code for both
                nations, prohibiting at the same time the use of the Roman law, thereby materially
                promoting the amalgamation of the two nations. It remained in force in Spain
                throughout the Middle Ages, and was translated into Spanish (Castilian) under
                Ferdinand III. (1229-1234, or 1241) under the title <hi rend="italic">Fuero Juzgo,
                </hi>or <hi rend="italic">Fucro de Cordova.</hi></p>
            <p>Editions : (1) <hi rend="italic">Fuero Judzgo en Latin e Castellano cotejado con los
                    mas antiguos y preciosos Codices por la Real Academia Españolo,</hi> Madrid,

            <p>(11a) Here also we may mention a <hi rend="italic">Lex Romana</hi> compiled for the
                Roman population, just as in Burgundy. It is also known as <hi rend="italic">Liber
                    Lcgum, Liber Legum Romanorum,</hi> and as <hi rend="italic">Lex Theodosii</hi>
                or <hi rend="italic">Corpus Theodosianum.</hi> It received the latter name because
                the <hi rend="italic">Codex Theodosianus</hi> served as its basis. It includes also
                excerpts from <hi rend="italic">novelise</hi> of Theodosius, Valentiuian, Marcian,
                Majorian, Severus, and from the <hi rend="italic">Institutiones</hi> of Gaius, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Sentential</hi> of Paulus, the <hi rend="italic">Codices
                    Gregorianus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hermogenianus,</hi> &amp;c. In a MS. of
                the 10th century it is called <hi rend="italic">Breviarium,</hi> and the title <hi
                    rend="italic">Breviarium Alarici</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Alaricianum</hi> has
                become general since the 16th century. The compilers of the Breviarium are not
                known, but it was published in the twenty-second year of Alaric II., <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> on 5th February 506, at Aire (Atures) in Gascony. It
                was also used in other western provinces of the Roman empire, and was imitated,
                excerpted, and altered in other places. One recension, probably dating from the 9th
                century, is known (from the place where the MS. was found) as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lex Romana Utinensis.</hi> The best edition is that of G. Haenel, <hi
                    rend="italic">Lex Romana Wisigothorum,</hi> Berlin, 1847.</p>
            <p>(11b) We have also a code for the Eastern Goths compiled by command of Theodoric
                after 506, but before 526, and known as <hi rend="italic">Edictum Theodorici.</hi>
                It consists of 155 chapters (with a few additions), which are in reality an epitome
                of Roman law. It was published in 1875, in <hi rend="italic">Mon. Germ. Hist.,</hi>
                Legg., v. p. 145 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> ed. by Professor Bluhme. </p>
            <p>(12) <hi rend="italic">Leges Langobardorum.—</hi>The first trace of Lombardic law is
                an edict of Rothar, consisting of 388 chapters, and promulgated at a diet held at
                Pavia on 22d November 643. This was followed by laws of Grimoald (668), nine
                chapters ; Liutprand (713-735), six books ; Ratchis (746), nine chapters ;
                Aistulphus <hi rend="italic">(c.</hi> 755), fourteen chapters. Additions were also
                made by Charlemagne and his successors down to Lothair II. In the manuscripts the
                texts are arranged, some in a chronological, some in a systematical order. The
                latter arrangement is already found in a MS. of the 9th century. The systematic
                collection, which was used chiefly in Bologna at lectures and for quotations and was
                known as <hi rend="italic">Lombarda (Liber Langobardæ s. Lombardæ),</hi> appears to
                have been made in the 11th century. The text as it exists at present is very
                corrupt, as a number of glosses (some of great antiquity) and formulæ, added in the
                first instance by those who had to use the code to explain certain enactments of the
                law, afterwards found their way into the text. Towards the end of the 12th and down
                to the beginning of the 16th century various glosses and commentaries on the
                Lombardae made their appearance. The first commentaries were those of Aripraud and
                of Albertus (second half of 12th century). The later commentators (Carolus de Tocco,
                    <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1200 ; Andreas of Barulo, c. 1230 ; Blasius de Morcone
                of Naples, before 1338 ; Boherius and Johannes Nenna of Bari, c. 1540) refer
                frequently to Roman law. Of the Edictum Rotharis a Greek translation was made, of
                which only fragments have been preserved (comp. C. E. Zachariä, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fragmenta versionis Graecae Lcgum Rotharis, Langob. regis,</hi> ex. cod. Paris.
                Græc., No. 1348, Heidelberg, 1835).</p>

                    comparatively speaking, no great distance of time between the <hi rend="italic"
                        >leges barbarorum</hi> and the Laws of Wales, while the contents of the
                    latter show a similar, nay almost the same, idea of law' as the former ; and,
                    apart from the fact that Wales became permanently connected at the end of the
                    13th century with a Teutonic people, the Anglo-Saxons, it has been noticed that
                    in Wales Roman and Germanic, but no traces of a specific Welsh, law are found.
