                    son&nbsp;of the brother of the former. And secondly, the story goes </span><span

                    class="font2"> that he who only studied the Law died at the age of&nbsp;forty
                    (Abayye living to sixty), whereas the synchronisms of Rabbāh’s&nbsp;life show
                    that he must have lived to a much greater age.</span></p></div><br clear="all" /><div>
