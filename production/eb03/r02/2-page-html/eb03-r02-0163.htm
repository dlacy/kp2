<p><span class="font0">reſolved not to give him battle, but rather to diſtreſs him by keeping cloſe at his heels, ſtraitening his quarters, and cutting off his convoys. As he had frequent&nbsp;opportunities of coming to an engagement, but always&nbsp;declined it, his friends and ſubalterna began to put ill&nbsp;conſtructions on his dilatorineſs to his face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theſe, together with the complaints of his ſoldiers, made him at length reſolve to venture a general action.&nbsp;With this deſign he marched into a large plain near the&nbsp;cities of Pharſalia and Thebes ; which latter was alſo&nbsp;called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Philippi,</span><span class="font0"> from Philip king of Macedon, and the&nbsp;father of Perſes, who, having reduced the Thebans,&nbsp;placed a colony of Macedonians in their city. This&nbsp;plain was watered by the Enipeus, and ſurrounded on&nbsp;all ſides by high mountains ; and Pompey, who was&nbsp;ſtill averſe from venturing an engagement, pitched his&nbsp;camp on the declivity of a ſteep mountain, in a place&nbsp;altogether inacceſſible. There he was joined by Scipio&nbsp;his father-in-law, at the head of the legions which he&nbsp;had brought with him from Syria and Cilicia. But&nbsp;notwithſtanding this reinforcement, he continued irre-ſolute, and unwilling to put all to the iſſue of a ſingle&nbsp;action ; being ſtill convinced of the wiſdom of his maxim, that it was better to deſtroy the enemy by fatigues&nbsp;and want, than to engage an army of brave veterans,&nbsp;who were in a manner reduced to deſpair. As he put&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">off </span><span class="font0">from day to day, under various pretences, deſcending into the plain where Cæſar was encamped, his officers forced him to call a council of war, when all to a&nbsp;man. were for venturing a general action the very next&nbsp;day. Thus was Pompey obliged to ſacriſice his own&nbsp;judgment to the blind ardour of the multitude ; and&nbsp;the neceſſary meaſures were taken for a general engagement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The event of this battle was in the higheſt degree fortunate for Cæſar j- ; who reſolved to purſue his advantage, and follow Pompey to whatever country he&nbsp;ſhould retire. Hearing, therefore, of his being at Am-phipolis, he ſent off his troops before him, and then&nbsp;embarked on board a little frigate in order to croſs the&nbsp;Helleſpont ; but in the middle of the ſtrait, he ſell in&nbsp;with one of Pompey’s commanders, at the head of ten&nbsp;ſhips of war. Cæſar, noway terrified at the ſuperiority&nbsp;of his force, bore up to him, and commanded him to&nbsp;ſubmit. The other inſtantly obeyed, awed by the terror of Cæſar’s name, and ſurrendered himſelf and his&nbsp;fleet at diſcretion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From thence he continued his voyage to Epheſus, then to Rhodes ; and being informed that Pompey had&nbsp;been there before him, he made no doubt but that he&nbsp;was fled to Egypt ; wherefore,, lofing no time, he ſet&nbsp;ſail for that kingdom, and arrived at Alexandria with&nbsp;about 4000 men ; a very inconſiderable force to keep&nbsp;ſuch a powerful kingdom under ſubjection. But he&nbsp;was now grown ſo ſecure in his good fortune, that he&nbsp;expected to find obedience everywhere. Upon his landing, the firſt accounts he received were of Pompey’s&nbsp;miſerable end, who had been aſſaſſinated by orders of&nbsp;the treacherous king as ſoon as he went on ſhore ; and&nbsp;ſoon after one of the murderers came with his head and&nbsp;ring as a moſt grateful preſent to the conqueror. But&nbsp;Cæſar turned away from it with horror, and ſhortly after ordered a magnificent tomb to be built to his memory on The ſpot where he was murdered ; and a temple near the place, to Nemeſis, who was the goddeſs</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div><a name="caption1"></a><h4><span class="font1">that puniſhed thoſe that were cruel to men in adverſity.</span></h4>
<p><span class="font0">It ſhould ſeem that the Egyptians by this time had ſome hopes of breaking off all alliance with the Ro·»&nbsp;naans ; which they conſidered, as in fact it was, but a&nbsp;ſpecious ſubjection. They firſt began to take offence&nbsp;at Cæſar’s carrying the enſigns of Roman power before&nbsp;him as he entered the city. Photinus, the eunuch, alſo&nbsp;treated him with diſreſpect, and even attempted his liſe.&nbsp;Cæſar, however, concealed his reſentment till he had a&nbsp;force ſufficient to puniſh his treachery ; and ſending&nbsp;privately for the legions which had been formerly enrolled for Pompey’s ſervice, as being the neareſſ to E-gypt, he in the mean time pretended to repoſe an entire conſidence in the king’s minifter. However, he&nbsp;ſoon changed his manner when he found himſelf in no&nbsp;danger from his attempts ; and declared, that, as being&nbsp;a Roman conſul, it was his duty to ſettle the ſucceſſion&nbsp;to the Egyptian crown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There were at that time two pretenders to the crown of Egypt : Ptolemy, the acknowledged king ; and the&nbsp;celebrated Cleopatra his ſiſſer ; who, by the cuftom of&nbsp;the country, was alſo his wiſe, and, by their father’s&nbsp;will, ſliared jointly in the ſucceſſion. However, not&nbsp;being contented with a bare participation of power, ſhe&nbsp;aimed at governing alone ; but being oppoſed in her&nbsp;views by the Roman ſenate, who confirmed her brother’s&nbsp;title to the crown, ſhe was banif∩ed into Syria with Ar-ſinoe her younger ſiſter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Cæſar, however, gave her new hopes of obtaining the kingdom, and ſent both for her and her brother to&nbsp;plead their cauſe before him. Photinus, the young&nbsp;king’s guardian, who had long borne the moſt inveterate hatred as well to Cæſar as to Cleopatra; diſdained&nbsp;this propoſal, and backed his refuſal by ſending an army of 20,000 men to beſiege him in Alexandria. Cæſar&nbsp;bravely repulſed the enemy for ſome time ; but finding&nbsp;the city of too great extent to be defended by ſe&gt; ſmall&nbsp;an army as he then had with him, he retired to the palace, which commanded the harbour, where he purpo-ſed to make a ſtand. Achillas, who commanded the&nbsp;Egyptians, attacked him there with great vigour, and&nbsp;ſtill aimed at making himſelf maſter of the fleet that&nbsp;lay before the palace. Cæſar, however, too well&nbsp;knew the importance of thoſe ſhips in the hands of an&nbsp;enemy ; and therefore burnt them all in ſpite of every&nbsp;effort to prevent it. He next poſſeſſed himſelf of&nbsp;the iſte of Pharos, which was the key to the Alexandrian port, by which he was enabled to receive the ſup.&nbsp;plies ſent him from all ſides ; and in this ſituation he&nbsp;determined to withſtand the united force of all the Egyptians-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the mean time, Cleopatra having heard of the preſent turn in her favour, reſolved to depend rather on Cæſar’s favour for gaining the government than her&nbsp;own forces. She had, in fact, aſſembled an army in&nbsp;Syria to ſupport her claims-; but now judged it the&nbsp;wiſeſt way to rely entirely on the deciſion of her ſelf-elected judge. But no arts, as ſhe juſtly conceived,&nbsp;were ſo likely to influence Cæſar, as the charms of her&nbsp;perſon. The difficulty was how to get at Cæſar, as&nbsp;her enemies were in poſſeſſion of all the avenues that&nbsp;led to the palace. For this purpoſe, ſhe went on board&nbsp;a ſmall veſſel, and in the evening landed near the palace j where, being wrapped up in a coverlet, ſhe wa&gt;</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
