Yielding therefore to neceſſity, he reſolved to ſtudy ſurgery and pharmacy ; and was with this vicw bound apprentice to Dr Findlay, a phyſician (a) in Fra-ſerſhurgh. But though obliged to relinquiſh for a time his favourite ſtudies, he did not think ignorance excu-ſable in a ſurgeon more than in a clergyman, or conceive that he could ever.become eminent in the profeſſion in which circumſtances had placed him, merely by ſkill in ſetting a bone or compounding a medicine. He deter-mined therefore, with the full approbation of his maſter, who very ſoon diſcovered his talents for literature, to make himſelf acquainted with at leaſt the outlines of the liberal arts and fcicnces ; and with this view he repaired in 1750 to the King’s College and univerſity of Aberdeen, where he obtained one of the <hi rend="italic">burſaries</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">exhibitions</hi>  which are there annually beſtowed upon ſuch can-didates for them as diſplay the ſhoſt accurate knowledge of the Latin language. The ſmall ſum of five pounds, however (which none of theſe burſaries exceed), was ſtill inadequate to the expence of reſidence in college ; but our young ſtudent was ſoon to obtain a more valu-âble exhibition, and to obtain it likewiſe by his own merit.</p><p>During the long vacation he returned to his maſter Dr Findlay, and was by him intruſted with a very deſpe-rate caſe in ſurgery, of which his management may be Laid to have laid the foundation of his future fortunes. A female fervant of one of the judges of the Court of Seffion, who, when the court was not fitting, reſided in the neighbourhood of Fraſerſhurgh, had been ſo dread-fully gored by a bull, that hardly any hopes werc enter-ſtained of her recovery; but Mr Ramſay, to whoſe care ſhe was entirely leſt, treated the wound with ſuch ſkil-ful attention, that, contrary to general expectation, his patient recovered. This attracted the judge’s notice, who having informed himſelf of the young man’s cir-eumſtances and character, recommended him ſo effec-tually to Sir Alexander Ramſay of Balmain, that he j&gt;refented him with a burfary of 15 pounds a-year, which commenced at the next <hi rend="italic">fejfioη</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">term,</hi>  in the fame college.</p><p>He now profecuted his ſtudies with comfort ; and thougſh he was detained in college a year longer than is uſual, being obliged, upon his acceptance of a ſecond burſary, to begin his courſe anew, he always conſidered this as a fortunate circumſtance, becauſe it gave him the celebrated Dr Reid three years for his preceptor. To that great and amiable philoſopher he fo recom-mended himſelf by his talents, his induſtry, and his vir-tues, that he was honoured with his friendſhip to the day of his death. Nor was it only to his maſters that his conduct recommended him ; Sir Alexander Ramſay, whom he viſited during fome of the vacations, was ſo Well pleaſed with his conversation, that he promiſed him</p><p>another burſary, in his gift, of 251. a-year, to com. ιnence immediately on the expiration of that which he enjoyed. This promiſe hc performed in the beginning of the year 1755 ; and at the ſolicitation of Dr Findlay even paid the money per advance to enable the cxhibi-tioner to travel for the purpoſe of improving himſelf in his profeſſion.</p><p>Thus provided, Mr Ramſay went to London, and ſtu-died ſurgery and pharmacy under the auſpices of Dr Macauly ; in whoſe family he lived ſor two years, careſſed and eſteemed both by him and by his lady. Afterwards, having paſſed the uſual examination at Surgeon’s-hall, he ſerved in his medical capacity for ſeveral years in the royal navy; but how long he was continued in the ſtation of a mate, or when and by whom he was firſt appoint-ed furgeon, we have not been able to learn. We can ſay, however,* upon the beſt authority, that by his humane and diligent diſcharge of his duty in either ſtation, he endeared himſelf to the ſeamen, and acquired the e-ſteem of his officers.</p><p>of his humanity there is indeed one memorable in-ſtance, which muſt not be omitted, whilſt he acted as ſurgeon of the Arundel, then commanded by Captain (now vice-admiral Sir Charles) Middleton, a ſlave-ſhip on her paſſage from Africa to the weſt Indies fell in with the fleet to which the Arundel belonged. An epidemical diſtemper, too common in ſuch veſſels, had fwept away not only a great number of the unfortunate negroes, but alſo many of the ſhip’s crew, and among others the ſurgeon. In this diſtreſſed ſituation the commander of the Guinea ſhip applied to the Engliſh Commodore for medical aſſiſtance ; but not a ſurgeon or ſurgeon’s mate in the whole fleet, except Mr Ramſay, would expoſe himſelf to the contagion of fo dangerous a diſtemper. Prompted, however, by his own innate benevolence, and fully authorized by his no leſs bene-volent commander, the ſurgeon of the Arundel, regard-leſs of perſonal danger, and truſting in that God to whom mercy is more acceptable than ſacrifice, went on board the infected ſhip, viſited all the patients, and re-mained long enough to leave behind him written direc∙ tions for their future treatment. If a cup of cold water given in charity be entitled to a reward, how much more ſuch an action as this ? But the rewards of Chriſtianity are not immediate. Mr Ramſay indeed eſcaped the contagion ; but on his return to his own ſhip, juſt as ſhe had got on the deck, he fell and broke his thighbone ; by which he was confined to his apartment for ten months, and rendered in a ſmall degree lame through the remainder of his life.</p><p>The fearleſs humanity which he diſplayed on this occaſion gained him the 'friendſhip and eſteem of Sir Charles Middleton, which no future action of his life had the ſmalleſt tendency to impair ; but the fracture of his thigh-bone and his ſubſequent lameneſs determin. ed him to quit the navy, and once more turn hie thoughts towards the church. Accordingly, while the Arundel lay at St Chriſtopher’s, he opened his views to</p><lb/><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi>  In the remote towns of Scotland the ſame man generally acts in the triple capacity of phyſician, furgeon, and apothecary ; and we could mention doctors of phyſic of the firſt eminence, who practiſe' thus within forty i∑riles of Edinburgh,</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
