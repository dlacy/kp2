<p><span class="font1">built between 1847 and 1861; a large penitentiary, insane asylum, orphans’ asylum, and beggars’ asylum; a law school,&nbsp;artisans’ school (Lyceu de Artes e Officios), and archaeological&nbsp;institute; a normal school and school of engineering; and war&nbsp;and naval arsenals. One of the most attractive churches is&nbsp;that of Nossa Senhora da Penha, surmounted by two slender&nbsp;spires and a dome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The port of Recife is one of the most important of Brazil, on account of its proximity to Europe and its convenience for&nbsp;vessels passing around the east shoulder of the continent. It&nbsp;is the landing-place for two transatlantic and one coastwise&nbsp;cable lines. Its harbour consists of an outer and inner anchorage,'&nbsp;the former an open roadstead, which are separated by a remarkable stone reef running parallel with the shore-line, leaving&nbsp;an inside passage 400 to 500 ft. wide. The entrance to the&nbsp;inner anchorage, which has a depth of about 20 ft., is opposite&nbsp;Fort Brum in the northern part of the city, and is marked by a&nbsp;small Dutch fort (Picāo) and a lighthouse at the northern&nbsp;extremity of the reef. This remarkable natural breakwater,&nbsp;which is about 50 ft. wide on top and has been repaired with&nbsp;masonry in some places, covers a considerable part of the coast-line in this part of Brazil. It is not a coral reef, as is sometimes&nbsp;stated, but is a consolidated ancient beach, now as hard and&nbsp;firm as stone.@@<sup>1</sup> In 1910 contractors were at work on improvements to the port to cost about £1,666,000, under a decree of&nbsp;the 3rd of December 1908. The exports include sugar, rum,&nbsp;cotton, hides, skins, rubber, wax, fibres, dyewoods, cacáu,&nbsp;mandioca flour, pineapples and other fruits. Pernambuco is&nbsp;the principal sugar-producing state of  Brazil, and Recife is&nbsp;therefore an important centre for this product. Its railway&nbsp;communications with the interior are good, and include the&nbsp;Sul de Pernambuco, Recife and Sāo Francisco, Central de&nbsp;Pernambuco, and the Recife to Limoeiro lines, the first three&nbsp;now being under the management of the Great Western of&nbsp;Brazil Co. There are also suburban lines to Olinda and Caxangá,&nbsp;the latter providing communication with some of the prettiest&nbsp;suburbs about the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Recife was settled about 1535, when Duarte Coelho Pereira landed there to take possession of the captaincy granted him&nbsp;by the Portuguese crown. The site of Coelho’s capital was&nbsp;Olinda, but Recife remained its port and did not become an&nbsp;independent </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mila</span><span class="font1"> (town) until 1710. Down to the close of&nbsp;the 18th century, when Rio de Janeiro became important,&nbsp;Recife was the second city of Brazil, and for a time its most&nbsp;important port. It was captured and plundered in 1595 by&nbsp;the English privateer James Lancaster. It was also captured&nbsp;by the Dutch in 1630 and remained in their possession till 1654,&nbsp;during which time the island of Antonio Vaz was occupied and&nbsp;the town greatly improved. At the end of the Dutch War&nbsp;the capital was removed from Olinda to Recife, where it has&nbsp;since remained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RECIPE, a statement of the materials and ingredients used in the making and preparation of a dish for cooking, a receipt.&nbsp;This is the principal current use, which was first applied to&nbsp;medieval prescriptions from the custom of placing the word,&nbsp;meaning “take this” (imperative of Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">recipere,</span><span class="font1"> to receive),&nbsp;often abbreviated R or ℞, at the head of the formula.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RECIPROCITY (Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">reciprocus,</span><span class="font1"> returning back the same way, alternating, probably from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">re</span><span class="font1"> back and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pro</span><span class="font1"> forward), the&nbsp;condition or state of being reciprocal, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> where there is give&nbsp;and take, mutual influence or correspondence between two&nbsp;parties, persons or things. In a more particular sense, reciprocity is a special arrangement between two nations under&nbsp;which the citizens of each obtain advantages or privileges in&nbsp;their trading relations with the other. This meaning of&nbsp;reciprocity, however, bears a different interpretation in European&nbsp;and in American usage. In the former, reciprocity between two&nbsp;nations usually means little more than the extension by one to&nbsp;the other of most favoured nation treatment, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> such advantages&nbsp;as it extends to any third country (see Commercial Treaties).</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">But in the United States reciprocity is the term applied to the concessions or arrangements made between that country and&nbsp;another without reference to any third country. Thus in the&nbsp;United States there are a maximum and minimum tariff, the&nbsp;rates of the maximum tariff being enforced on the goods of&nbsp;those countries which have no reciprocity treaty with the&nbsp;United States, and the rates of the minimum on certain products&nbsp;of those countries which have by a reciprocity treaty given&nbsp;special advantages or concessions to certain products of the&nbsp;United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RECITAL (from Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">recitare,</span><span class="font1"> to read out, particularly of a public document), an account or repetition of the details of some&nbsp;act, proceeding, fact, &amp;c., particularly, in law, that part of a&nbsp;legal document, such as a lease, which contains a statement of&nbsp;certain facts, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> the purport for which the deed is made. In&nbsp;music, the word is used of an instrumental performance given&nbsp;by a single person, and also of a performance of the works of a&nbsp;single composer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RECKLINGHAUSEN, a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of Westphalia, 22 m. by rail N.W. of Dortmund on&nbsp;the railway to Münster. Pop. (1905) 44,396. In the neighbourhood are extensive coal-mines and brick-works, and the industries&nbsp;embrace the manufacture of linen, beer, spirits and tobacco. </span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The county of Recklinghausen belonged </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font1"> the archbishopric of Cologne until 1803, when it passed to the duke of Arenberg.&nbsp;It was known as the Vest Recklinghausen. In 1810 it was&nbsp;divided by Napoleon between the grand duchy of Berg and&nbsp;France, but was, in 1815, restored to the duke of Arenberg&nbsp;as a fief under Prussian sovereignty.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RECLAMATION OF LAND. The boundaries between sea and land are perennially changing. In many sheltered bays and&nbsp;estuaries the sea is receding, while along other portions of the&nbsp;sea-coast it is continuously encroaching. The same causes&nbsp;operate to produce both results: the rivers carry down with&nbsp;them detritus and sediment from the higher ground; the sea,&nbsp;aided by wind and tide, is always eroding exposed portions of the&nbsp;seaboard; and even such lesser influences as rain and frost&nbsp;assist in disintegrating cliffs composed of softer strata.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The main object of reclaiming land from the sea is to increase the area of ground available for cultivation. Land which has&nbsp;been raised by accretion nearly to high-water level can be shut&nbsp;off from the sea by works of a simple and inexpensive nature,&nbsp;and the fresh alluvial soil thus obtained is generally very fertile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Accretion in estuaries takes place very slowly under ordinary conditions. Although at any one time the sheltered areas may&nbsp;be large and the deposit of silt fairly rapid, not much permanent&nbsp;accretion will take place owing to the frequent shifting of the&nbsp;channels. Directly, however, a fixed channel is secured by&nbsp;longitudinal embankments or training walls, accretion progresses&nbsp;rapidly and uninterruptedly by the deposit of sediment in the&nbsp;slack-water behind the embankments and at the sides of the&nbsp;estuary; and this is especially the case if the training works&nbsp;are raised to the level of high water, for this has the effect of&nbsp;restricting the greater part of the scour of tide and fresh-water&nbsp;discharge to the one fixed channel. The rate of accretion varies&nbsp;with the shelter of the site and the amount of sediment carried&nbsp;by the water; but by degrees the foreshores, in the upper&nbsp;portion and at the sides of the embanked estuary, are raised&nbsp;sufficiently for samphire to make its appearance, and, later on,&nbsp;a coarse grass. Ultimately the time arrives when the water&nbsp;may be altogether excluded by the construction of enclosing&nbsp;embankments; these must be raised above the level of the&nbsp;highest tide, and should have a flat slope on the exposed side,&nbsp;protected, in proportion to exposure and depth of water, against&nbsp;the face with clay, sods, fascines or stone pitching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the intermediate stages of the process outlined above much may be done to promote the growth of accretion, or warping&nbsp;as it is termed, and to ensure the fertility of the reclaimed land.&nbsp;The deposit of warp is accelerated by anything which tends to&nbsp;reduce the flow and consequent scour of the ebb-tide over the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
