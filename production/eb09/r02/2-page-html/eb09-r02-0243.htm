<p><span class="font1">that continued to be referred to the centumviral court, but otherwise it had been long in disuse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Gaius explains that it was resorted to both in real and personal actions. Unfortunately the MS. of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Institutes&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">is defective in the passage in which he described its application to the latter. We possess the greater part of his&nbsp;account of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">actio in rem</span><span class="font1"> as employed to raise and determine a question of ownership ; but his illustration is of&nbsp;vindication of a slave, and not so interesting or instructive&nbsp;as the proceedings for vindication of land. These, however, can be reconstructed with tolerable certainty with the&nbsp;aid derived from Cicero, Varro, and Gellius.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The parties appeared before the magistrate, each armed with a rod (fiestuca) representing his spear {quir or hαsta), the symbol, as&nbsp;Gaius says, of quiritarian ownership. The first word was spoken&nbsp;by the raiser of the action, and addressed to his opponent : “I say&nbsp;that the land in question [describing it sufficiently for identification] is mine in quiritary right {meumesse ex jure quiritium) ; wherefore I require you to go there and join issue with me in presence&nbsp;of the magistrate {injure maηum eonserere}C Thereupon, according to the earliest practice, the magistrate and the parties, accompanied by their friends and backers, proceeded to the ground for&nbsp;the purpose : the court was transferred from the forum to the&nbsp;land itself. As distances increased, however, and the engagements&nbsp;of the consuls multiplied, this became inconvenient. Instead of&nbsp;it, this course was adopted : the parties went to the spot without&nbsp;the magistrate, but on his command, and there joined issue in the&nbsp;presence of their seconds, who had been ordered to accompany&nbsp;them, and who probably made a report of the due observance of&nbsp;formalities on their return. Still later the procedure was further&nbsp;simplified by having a turf brought from the place beforehand—&nbsp;probably as time advanced there would be no very particular inquiry as to where it had been obtained—and deposited a few yards&nbsp;from the magistrate’s chair ; and, when he ordered the parties to&nbsp;go to the ground and join issue, they merely brought forward the&nbsp;turf and set it before him, and proceeded to make their formal&nbsp;vindications upon it, as representing the whole land in dispute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ritual was as follows. The raiser of the action, addressing his adversary, again affirmed his ownership, but this time with&nbsp;the significant addition—“As I have asserted my right by word&nbsp;of mouth, look you, so do I now with my viηdicta&quot;∙, and therewith he touched the turf with his rod, which was called vindieta&nbsp;when employed for this purpose. The magistrate then asked&nbsp;the other party whether he meant to counter-vindicate. If he&nbsp;replied in the negative or made no response, there was instant&nbsp;decree {addictw) in favour of the first party, and the proceedings&nbsp;were at an end. If, however, he counter-vindicated, it was by&nbsp;repeating the same words and re-enacting the same play as his adversary :—“I say that the land is mine in quiritary right, and I&nbsp;too lay my vindieta upon it” The verbal and symbolical vindication and counter-vindication completed what was technically the&nbsp;manus consertio. The parties were now in this position : each&nbsp;had asserted his ownership, and had figuratively had recourse to&nbsp;arms in maintenance of his contention. But the matter was to&nbsp;be settled judicially, so the magistrate once more intervened and&nbsp;ordered both to withdraw from the land. The dialogue was then&nbsp;resumed, the vindicant demanding to know from his opponent upon&nbsp;what pretence {eausa) he had counter-vindicated. In the illustration in Gaius he avoided the question and pleaded the general issue,&nbsp;—“I have done as is my right in laying my vindieta on the land.”&nbsp;But there can be little doubt that in certain circumstances the&nbsp;counter-vindicant would deem it expedient to disclose his title.&nbsp;This was very necessary where he attributed his right to a conveyance upon which two years’ possession had not yet followed ;&nbsp;in such a case he had to name his author {auctοrem laudare) if&nbsp;he desired to preserve recourse against the latter on the warranty&nbsp;implied in the mancipation. That probably entailed a suspension&nbsp;of the proceedings to allow of the author’s citation for his interest ;&nbsp;and on their resumption, if he appeared and admitted his auctοritae,&nbsp;he was formally made a party to the action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The proceedings had now reached the sacramental stage proper. The first challenge came from the vindicant,—“Since you have&nbsp;vindicated unrightfully, I challenge you with a sacrament of 500&nbsp;assesto which the counter-vindicant responded,—“And I you.”&nbsp;This was technically the Sacramento provocatio. The magistrate&nbsp;thereupon remitted the matter for trial to the centumviral court,&nbsp;or possibly, in certain cases, to a single judge, and in the presence&nbsp;of witnesses called by the parties {litie cοntestαtiο) declared what&nbsp;exactly was the question put in issue which the court or judge&nbsp;was to decide. At the same time, according to Gaius’s account of&nbsp;the procedure, he required sureties from the parties for the eventual&nbsp;payment by him who was unsuccessful of the sacrament he had&nbsp;offered to stake, and which became a forfeit to the exchequer. (The&nbsp;original practice was for the stake to be deposited by both parties&nbsp;in the hands of the pontiffs before they were heard by the cen-tumviral court ; after judgment that of the gainer was reclaimed&nbsp;by him, while that of the loser was retained for religious uses.)&nbsp;The magistrate also made arrangements for the interim possession&nbsp;of the land by one or other of the litigants, taking security from&nbsp;him that, if he was eventually unsuccessful, it should be returned&nbsp;to his opponent, along with all the fruits and profits drawn in&nbsp;the interval. At the trial, as both parties were vindicants, there&nbsp;must have been a certain burden of proof upon both sides. The&nbsp;vindicant, one may believe, must have been required to establish in&nbsp;the first instance that the thing he claimed had at some time been&nbsp;his ; and then, but probably not till then, the counter-vindicant&nbsp;would have to prove a later title in his person sufficient to exclude&nbsp;that of his opponent. The judgment, as already observed, necessarily&nbsp;involved a finding on the main question ; but in form it was a declaration as to the sacrament : that of the party who prevailed was&nbsp;declared to be just, and that of his unsuccessful opponent unjust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Looking at this ritual as a whole the conviction is irresistible that it could not have been so devised by one brain. It reveals&nbsp;and combines three distinct stages in the history of procedure,—&nbsp;appeal to arms and self-help, appeal to the gods and the spiritual&nbsp;power, appeal to the civil magistrate and his judicial office. As&nbsp;Gellius says, the real and substantial fight for might, that in olden&nbsp;days had been maintained at the point of the spear, had given&nbsp;place to a civil and festucarian combat in which words were the&nbsp;weapons, and which was to be settled by the interposition of the&nbsp;praetor. But this does not explain the sacrarneηtum. Very various&nbsp;theories have been proposed to account for it. According to Gaius,&nbsp;it was nothing more than the sum of money staked by each of&nbsp;the parties, which was forfeited originally to sacred and afterwards to public uses by him who was unsuccessful, as a penalty&nbsp;for his rashly running into litigation ; and substantially the same&nbsp;explanation is given by Festus in one of his definitions of the&nbsp;word. But this is far from satisfactory; for it involves the&nbsp;absurdity of declaring that a penalty imposed by law could be&nbsp;unjust {iηjustιιm) in any case, and the still greater absurdity of&nbsp;declaring it just in the case of the party who was in the right, and&nbsp;unjust in the case of him who was in the wrong. There is another&nbsp;definition in Festus—“a thing is said to be done Sacramento when&nbsp;the sanction of an oath is interposed ”—which lends support to the&nbsp;opinion that there was a time when parties to a question of right&nbsp;were required to take an oath to the verity of their respective&nbsp;assertions ; that they were also required concurrently to deposit five&nbsp;bullocks or five sheep, according to the nature or value of the&nbsp;thing in dispute, to abide the issue of the inquiry;@@<sup>1</sup> that the question&nbsp;for determination was whose oath was just and whose unjust ; and&nbsp;that he who was found to have sworn unjustly forfeited his cattle&nbsp;or sheep as a piamentum—a peace-offering to the outraged deity—&nbsp;while the other party reclaimed his from the repository in which&nbsp;they had been detained in the interval.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the Lex Aternia Tarpeia of the year 300 u.c. that commuted the five bullocks and five sheep into 500 and 50 lb of copper&nbsp;respectively (Cic., De Rep., ii. 35, § 60, where the words usually printed&nbsp;“de multae Sacramento” should read “de multa et Sacramento”); Fest.,&nbsp;s.v. “Peculatus ” ( Bruns, Font es, p. 279). For the pounds’weight of raw&nbsp;metal the XII. Tables substituted the same number of asses, declaring&nbsp;that 500 should be the summa sacrarnenti when the cause of action&nbsp;was worth 1000 asses or more, 50 when worth less or the question one&nbsp;of freedom or slavery (Gai., iv. 14).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Varro, De L. L., v. 180 (Bruns, p. 303), says that, even after the&nbsp;summa sacrarnenti had been converted into money, it was deposited&nbsp;ad pontem,—some bridge, he does not say which, where there was a&nbsp;sacred “ pound.” (Curiously enough, the Irish spelling of “ pound ”&nbsp;is “ pont Skeat’s Etym. Diet., s.v. “ Pound.”) A most ingenious and&nbsp;plausible explanation was suggested by Danz in 1867, in the Zeitsehr.&nbsp;f Reehtsgesch., vol. vi. p. 359. Recalling the facts that there had been&nbsp;discovered in the Tiber Island saeella of Jupiter Jurarius and Dius&nbsp;Fidius, the two deities to whom solemn oaths were usually addressed,&nbsp;and that the island was spoken of as “ inter duos pontes,” because connected with both banks of the river by bridges bearing no particular&nbsp;names, he suggested that the island may have been the place to which&nbsp;disputants resorted to make their sacramentel, and that the cattle,&nbsp;sheep, or money were deposited in a place for the purpose before the&nbsp;bridge was crossed. Much the same explanation was offered by&nbsp;Huschke two years later in his book Das alte römische Jahr (Breslau,&nbsp;1869), p. 360, apparently without being aware of Danz’s speculation.&nbsp;He adds, on the authority of the Iguvine Tables, that, while bullocks&nbsp;were offered to Jupiter, only sheep were offered to Dius Fidius. The&nbsp;island, he thinks, must have been selected as neutral ground to which&nbsp;all parties might have access, and which obviated intrusion into the&nbsp;temples of the two gods on the Capitol and Quirinal respectively.&nbsp;And it is to its use as the scene of the sacramental procedure that he&nbsp;attributes its name of “holy island,” rather than to the fact of its&nbsp;having been the seat of the temple of Æsculapius. Huschke recurs&nbsp;to and enforces this view in his Mιdta und Saerαmeηtum (1874), p.&nbsp;410, where he does refer to Danz’s paper.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
