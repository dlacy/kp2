This was readily agreed to; and the archbiſhop was allowed to return in ſafety to his palace about the  ſame time that Angus returned from his expedition againſt the borderers. Nothing was then ſeen at court but feſtivities of every kind, in which the queen-mother, who was new relieved from her confinement, took part: and ſhe was afterwards ſuffered to depart to the caſtle of Stirling; which Angus, not attending to its value, had neglected to ſecure. In the mean time the archbiſhop invited the Douglaſſes to ſpend ſome days with him at his caſtle; which they accordingly did, and carried the king along with them. Here James diſſembled ſo well, and ſeemed to be ſo enamoured of his new way of life, that Angus thought there could be no danger in leaving him in the hands of his friends till he ſhould return to Lothian to ſettle ſome public as well as private affairs. Having taken leave of the king, he left him in the cuſtody of his uncle Archibald, his brother  Sir George, and one James Douglas of Parkhead, who was captain of the guards that watched his majeſty on pretence of doing him honour. The earl was no ſooner gone than the archbiſhop ſent an invitation to Sir George Douglas, deſiring him to come to St Andrew's, and there put the laſt hand to the leaſes, and finiſh the bargains that had been ſpoken of between them. This was ſo plauſible, that he immediately ſet out for St Andrew’s; while his uncle the treaſurer went to Dundee, where he had an amour. James thinking this to be the beſt opportunity that ever preſented to him for an  eſcape, reſolved to avail himſelf of it at all events; and found means, by a private meſſage, to appriſe his mother of his deſign. It was then the ſeaſon for hunting and diverſion, which James often followed in the park  of Falkland; and calling for his forreſter, he told him, that as the weather was fine, he intended to kill a ſtag next morning, ordering him at the ſame time to ſummon all the gentlemen in the neighbourhood to attend him with their beſt dogs. He then called for his chief domeſtics, and commanded them to get his ſupper early, becauſe he intended to be in the field by day-break; and he talked with the captain of his guard of nothing but the excellent ſport he expected next morning. In the mean time, he had engaged two young men, the one a page of his own, the other John Hart, a helper about his ſtables, to attend him in his flight, and to provide him with the dreſs of a groom for a diſguiſe. Having formally taken leave of his attendants, charging them to be ready early in the morning, and being left alone, he ſtole ſoftly out of his bed-chamber, went to the ſtable unperceived by the guards, dreſſed himſelf in his diſguiſe; and he and his companions mounting the three beſt horſes there, galloped to Stirling caſtle; into which, by the queen’s appointment, he was admitted ſoon alter day-break. He commanded all the gates to be ſecured; and the queen having previouſly prepared every thing for a vigorous defence, orders were given that none ſhould be admitted into the caſtle without the king’s permiſſion.</p><p>About an hour after the king eſcaped from Falkland, Sir George Douglas returned; and being aſſured that his majeſty was aſleep, he went to bed. It appears that James had been ſeen and known in his flight; for in the morning the bailiff of Abernethy came poſt-haſte to inform Sir George that the king had paſſed Stirling bridge. They had, however, ſome glimmering hope that the king might be gone to Bambrigh: but that ſurmiſe was ſoon found to be falſe; and an expreſs was diſpatched, informing Angus of all that had happened. The earl quickly repaired to Falkland, where he and his friends came to a reſolution of going to Stirling, and demanding acceſs to the king.</p><p>James by this time had iſſued letters to the earls of Huntley, Argyle, Athol, Glencairn, Menteith, Rothes, and Eglinton; the lords Graham, Levingſton, Lindſay, Sinclair, Ruthven, Drummond, Evandale, Maxwell, and Semple. Before all of them could arrive at Stirling, the earl of Angus and his friends were upon their journey to the ſame place; but were ſtopped by a herald at arms, commanding them on their allegiance not to approach within ſix miles of the king’s reſidence. This order having ſufficiently intimated what they were to expect, the earl deliberated with his party how to proceed. Some of them were for marching on and taking the caſtle by ſurpriſe: but that was found to be impracticable, eſpecially as they had no artillery. The earl and his brother therefore reſolved to make a ſhow of ſubmiſſion to the king’s order; and they accordingly went to Linlithgow. By this time all the nobility already mentioned, and many others, had aſſembled at Stirling; and James, calling them to council, inveighed againſt the tyranny of the Douglaſſes with an acrimony that ſufficiently diſcovered what pain it muſt have given him when he was obliged to bear it in ſilence. He concluded his ſpeech with theſe words: “Therefore I deſire, my lords, that I may be ſatisfied of the ſaid earl, his kin, and friends. For I vow that Scotland ſhall not hold us both, while I be revenged on him and his.”</p><p>The reſult of the council’s deliberation was, that proclamation ſhould be made, renewing the order for the Douglaſſes not to approach the court, and diveſting the earl of Angus and his brother of all their public employments. In the mean time, ſuch was the moderation of the aſſembly, that by their advice James ordered the earl to retire to the north of the Spey till his pleaſure ſhould be known; but his brother was commanded to ſurrender himſelf a priſouer in the caſtle of Edinburgh, to take his trial in a very full parliament (all the members being ſummoned to attend), to be held in that city next September. The earl and his brother conſidered their compliance with thoſe conditions as a prelude to their deſtruction; and reſolved to juſtify their treaſons by ſtill greater exceſſes, in ſurpriſing the town of Edinburgh, and holding it againſt the king and parliament, before the latter could aſſemble. Hiſtorians have not done that juſtice to the proceedings of the royal party on this occaſion which they deſerve. The management of the king’s eſcape, his reception into Stirling, the fortifying that caſtle, and the ready obedience of his great nobility, ſome of whom attended him with their followers before they received any ſummonſes for that purpoſe, are proofs of wiſe and ſpirited deliberations. Their conduct at this time was equally conſiflent with the ſame plan of foreſight.</p><p>It was naturally to be ſuppoſed that the Douglaſſes, who remained aſſembled in a numerous body, would</p></body></text></TEI>
