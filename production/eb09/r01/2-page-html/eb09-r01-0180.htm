<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">even are continuously fading away, while the former now embrace many millions of adherents belonging to various&nbsp;nations and races, and ever go on increasing more or less&nbsp;rapidly, this cannot be due to some fortuitous or external&nbsp;circumstances only, but must have its principal cause in&nbsp;the very nature of each sort of religions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">4. When we call the one particularistic the others&nbsp;universalistic (not universal), the one national the other&nbsp;human, when we describe the one as bound to special&nbsp;doctrines and rites, the others, though equally embodying&nbsp;themselves in doctrines and rites wherever they w<sup>r</sup>ere&nbsp;organized into churches or state religions, as nevertheless&nbsp;really free from them and starting from principles and&nbsp;maxims, we possibly use words apt to be misunderstood&nbsp;and perhaps wanting some qualification, but the meaning&nbsp;of them on the whole is sufficiently clear. In calling&nbsp;nomistic religions, like Judaism and Mazdaism, particularistic or national, we do not mean to say that they are&nbsp;exclusive in character and that they have not tried to&nbsp;spread beyond the boundaries of the race and the nation&nbsp;to which they belonged originally. They have done so&nbsp;indeed; they hoped to extend their dominion, but they&nbsp;succeeded only where they could impose the nationality&nbsp;or the civilization with which they had grown together,&nbsp;like the Chinese in Corea and Japan, or the Brahmans in&nbsp;several parts of India; and it is known that the proselytes of&nbsp;Judaism always ranked below the born sons of Abraham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Now Buddhism, Islam, and. Christianity were neither national nor particularistic. All of them were the representatives of ideas surpassing so to say the national&nbsp;horizon; all of them had in view, not the special religious&nbsp;wants of the nation, but more general aspirations of the&nbsp;human heart and mind. Two of them, therefore, were&nbsp;rejected, after a shorter or longer struggle, by the peoples&nbsp;to which their founders belonged by birth; and it is a&nbsp;well-known fact that Mohammedanism, though founded&nbsp;by an Arab, took its fundamental ideas from Judaism and&nbsp;Christianity, and that not the Arabs, but foreign nations,&nbsp;especially the Persians, raised it to the high position&nbsp;which it would not have occupied in the world without&nbsp;them. The national form of the Buddhistic idea was&nbsp;Jainism, that of the Christian idea Ebionitism, and&nbsp;perhaps the Wahhabites may be considered as the national&nbsp;reformers of Mohammedanism ; and it is only natural that&nbsp;none of these sects found adherents except among the&nbsp;peoples in the midst of which they arose. Nor were&nbsp;Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity particularistic. Buddhism “looks for the man; the miseries of existence beset&nbsp;all alike, and its law<sup>r</sup> is a law of grace for all.”—So too in&nbsp;its way does Islam; in the beginning it spreads by conquest, but the faithful of every nationality, whether&nbsp;converted by the force of arms or by the preaching of&nbsp;missionaries, acquire the same rights and dignity as the&nbsp;Arabs. The universalism of Christianity needs no proof.&nbsp;Here, however, the difference begins. We class these&nbsp;three religions under one head, because they resemble one&nbsp;another in so many respects, and because they differ from&nbsp;the other religious communities founded by individuals&nbsp;precisely in that in which they are mutually alike. But&nbsp;we are far from placing them on the same level. Islam,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> is not original, not a ripe fruit, but rather a wild&nbsp;offshoot of Judaism and Christianity. Buddhism, though&nbsp;the most widely spread, has never been victorious except&nbsp;where it had to contend with religions standing on no&nbsp;very high degree of development. For a short time it&nbsp;had a footing in Persian countries, but there its influence&nbsp;was neither deep nor durable, and in China it was not&nbsp;even able to overcome Confucianism and Taoism ; it seems&nbsp;to have been driven from India by Brahmanism, without&nbsp;being actually persecuted. Both Islam and Buddhism, if</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">not national, are only relatively universalistic, and show the one-sidedness, the one of the Semitic, the other of the&nbsp;Aryan race. The former represents an important religious&nbsp;idea—the absolute sovereignty of the one God, towards&nbsp;whom man, being nothing himself, has only one duty,&nbsp;that of tacit obedience; it exalts the divine, not combining it with, but opposing it to, the human, which it&nbsp;despises, and therefore neglects the development of ethics.&nbsp;Buddhism on the contrary neglects the divine, preaches&nbsp;the final salvation of man from the miseries of existence&nbsp;through the power of his own self-renunciation; and&nbsp;therefore, as it is atheistic in its origin, it very soon&nbsp;becomes infected by the most fantastic mythology and the&nbsp;most childish superstitions. If religion really is the&nbsp;synthesis of dependence and liberty, we might say that&nbsp;Islam represents the former, Buddhism the latter element&nbsp;only, while Christianity does full justice to both of them.&nbsp;Christianity, the pure and unalloyed at least, has fused&nbsp;dependence and liberty, the divine and the human, religion&nbsp;and ethics into an indivisible unity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">5. There are still some other points of difference. Thus,&nbsp;to mention one point only, Mohammedanism in its external&nbsp;features is little better than an extended Judaism. Spread&nbsp;over many countries, adopted by various nations differing&nbsp;in culture, speech, and race, nevertheless it has its holy&nbsp;language, its unvarying rites, its central sanctuary round&nbsp;which the pilgrims from every part of the Mohammedan&nbsp;world assemble every year. Not so with Buddhism and&nbsp;Christianity. If Christian crusaders tried to reconquer&nbsp;their Holy Land from the infidels, and in fact possessed it&nbsp;for a time, if mediaeval Buddhist pilgrims desired to see,&nbsp;and some Christian pilgrims even now visit, the places&nbsp;where the cradle of their faiths once stood, all this makes&nbsp;no longer an integral part of their worship, which is not&nbsp;necessarily bound to place or time. The divisions of&nbsp;Buddhism and Christianity are mutually much more independent than those of Mohammedanism. Still, though&nbsp;in this respect Buddhism comes nearer to Christianity,&nbsp;this alone preaches a worship in spirit and in truth;&nbsp;and in that which Rothe called its greatest excellence, in&nbsp;its variety, its changeableness, its power of adapting&nbsp;itself to the religious wants of various generations, peoples,&nbsp;and individuals, in a word, in its elasticity, which is the&nbsp;natural result of its purely spiritual character, Christianity&nbsp;ranks incommensurably high above both its rivals.@@<sup>1</sup> But&nbsp;we cannot pursue this matter any further.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">We now give the following sketch of a morphological classification of religions :—</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(a) Polydsemonistic Magical Religions under tlie control&nbsp;of Animism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">To this class belong the religions of the so-called savages or uncivilized peoples, but they are only degraded remnants of what&nbsp;they once must have been.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">b)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Purified or organized Magical Religions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> To prevent misconstruction, it is perhaps not superfluous to state that we are giving here neither a confession of faith nor an apology,&nbsp;but that we have here to treat Christianity simply as a subject of&nbsp;comparative study, from a scientific, not from a religious point of&nbsp;view.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
