<p><span class="font1">volume of freight is raw material and crude food-stuffs, and the distances are great, a low charge per unit of transportation&nbsp;is more important than any consideration such as quickness&nbsp;of delivery; therefore full car-loads of freight are massed&nbsp;into enormous trains, which run unbroken for distances of&nbsp;perhaps 1000 m. to a seaport or distributing centre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The weight and speed of goods trains vary enormously according to local conditions, but the following figures, which&nbsp;refer to traffic on the London &amp; North-Western&nbsp;railway between London and Rugby, may be taken&nbsp;as representative of good English practice. Coal&nbsp;trains, excluding the engine, weigh up to 800 or 900 tons,&nbsp;and travel at from 18 to 22 m. an hour; ordinary goods or&nbsp;merchandise trains, weighing 430 tons, travel at from 25 to 30 m.&nbsp;an hour; and quick merchandise trains with limited loads of&nbsp;300 tons make 35 to 40 m. an hour. In the United States&nbsp;mineral and grain trains, running at perhaps 12 m. an hour, may&nbsp;weigh up to about 4000 tons, and loads of 2000 tons are common.&nbsp;Merchandise trains run faster and carry less. Their speed must&nbsp;obviously depend greatly on topographical conditions. In the&nbsp;great continental basin there are long lines with easy gradients&nbsp;and curves, while in the Allegheny and Rocky Mountains the&nbsp;gradients are stiff, and the curves numerous and of short radius.&nbsp;Such trains, therefore, range in weight from 600 to 1800 tons or&nbsp;even more, and the journey speeds from terminus to terminus,&nbsp;including stops, vary from 15 to 30 m. an hour, the rate of&nbsp;running rising in favourable circumstances to 40 or even 60 m.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Couplers. </span><span class="font1">—The means by which vehicles are joined together into trains are of two kinds—automatic and non-automatic,&nbsp;the difference between them being that with the former the&nbsp;impact of two vehicles one on the other is sufficient to couple&nbsp;them without any human intervention such as is required with&nbsp;the latter. The common form of non-automatic coupler, used&nbsp;in Great Britain for goods wagons, consists of a chain and hook;&nbsp;the chain hangs loosely from a slot in the draw-bar, which&nbsp;terminates in a hook, and coupling is effected by slipping the&nbsp;chain of one vehicle over the hook of the next. For this opera-tion, or its reverse, a man has to go in between the wagons,&nbsp;unless, as in Great Britain, he is provided with a coupling-stick&nbsp;—that is, a pole having a peculiarly shaped hook at one end by&nbsp;which the chain can be caught and thrown on or off the drawbar hook. This coupling gear is placed centrally between a&nbsp;pair of buffers; formerly these were often left “ dead ’’—that is,&nbsp;consisted of solid prolongations of the frame of the vehicle,&nbsp;but now they are made to work against springs which take up&nbsp;the shocks that occur when the wagons are thrown violently&nbsp;against one another in shunting. In British practice the chains&nbsp;consist of three links, and are of such a length that when fully&nbsp;extended there is a space of a few inches between opposing&nbsp;buffers; this slack facilitates the starting of a heavy train,&nbsp;since the engine is able to start the wagons one by one and the&nbsp;weight of the train is not thrown on it all at once. For passenger&nbsp;trains and occasionally for fast goods trains screw couplings are&nbsp;substituted for the simple chains. In these the central bar&nbsp;which connects the two end links has screw threads cut upon it,&nbsp;and by means of a lever can be turned so as either to shorten&nbsp;the coupling and bring the vehicles together till their buffers&nbsp;are firmly pressed together, or to lengthen it to permit the end&nbsp;link to be lifted off the hook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another form of coupler, which used to be universal in the United States, though it has now been almost entirely superseded by the automatic coupler, was the “ link and pin, ” which&nbsp;differed fundamentally from the couplers commonly used in&nbsp;Europe, in the fact that it was a buffer as well as a coupler, no&nbsp;side buffers being fitted. In it the draw-bar, connected through&nbsp;a spring to the frame of the car, had at its outboard end a socket&nbsp;into which one end of a solid link was inserted and secured by a&nbsp;pin. The essential change from the link and pin to the automatic coupler is in the outboard end or head of the draw-bar.&nbsp;The socket that received the link is replaced by a hook, shown at&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font1"> in fig. 28, which is usually called the knuckle. This hook&nbsp;swings on the pivot </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">B,</span><span class="font1"> and has an arm which extends backwards,&nbsp;practically at right angles with the working face of the hook,&nbsp;in a cavity in the head, and engages with the locking-pin C.&nbsp;This locking-pin is lifted by a suitable lever which extends to&nbsp;one or both sides of the car; lifting it releases the knuckle,&nbsp;which is then free to swing open, disconnecting the two cars.&nbsp;The knuckle stands open until the coupling is pushed against&nbsp;another coupling, when the two hooks turn on their pivots to&nbsp;the position shown in fig. 28, and, the locking-pin dropping&nbsp;into place, the couplers are made fast. This arrangement is&nbsp;only partly automatic, since it often happens that when two cars&nbsp;are brought together to couple the knuckles are closed and must&nbsp;be opened by hand. There are various contrivances by which&nbsp;this may be done by a man standing clear of the cars, but often&nbsp;he must go in between their ends to reach the knuckle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This form of automatic coupler has now gained practically universal acceptance in the United States. To effect this&nbsp;result required many years of discussion and experiment. The&nbsp;Master Car Builders’ Association, a great body of mechanical&nbsp;officers organized especially to being about improvement and&nbsp;uniformity in details of construction and operation, expressed&nbsp;its sense of the importance of “ self-coupling ’’ so far back as&nbsp;1874, but no device of the kind that could be considered useful&nbsp;had then been invented. At that time a member of the Association referred to the disappearance of automatic couplers which&nbsp;had been introduced thirty or forty years before. This body&nbsp;pursued the subject with more or less diligence, and in 1884 laid&nbsp;down the principle that the automatic coupler should be one&nbsp;acting in a vertical plane—that is, the engaging faces should be&nbsp;free to move up and down within a considerable range, in order&nbsp;to provide for the differences in the height of cars. By the fixing&nbsp;of this principle the task of the inventor was considerably&nbsp;simplified. In 1887 a committee reported that the coupler&nbsp;question was the “ knottiest mechanical problem that had ever&nbsp;been presented to the railroad, ” and over 4000 attempted&nbsp;solutions were on record in the United States Patent Office.&nbsp;The committee had not found one that did not possess grave&nbsp;disadvantages, but concluded that the “ principle of contact of&nbsp;the surfaces of vertical surfaces embodied in the Janney coupler&nbsp;afforded the best connexion for cars on curves and tangents ”;&nbsp;and in 1887 the Association recommended the adoption of a&nbsp;coupler of the Janney type, which, as developed later, is shown in&nbsp;fig. 28. The method of constructing the working faces of this&nbsp;coupler is shown in fig. 29. The principle was patented, but&nbsp;the company owning the patent undertook to permit its free use&nbsp;by railway companies which were members of the Master Car&nbsp;Builders’ Association, and thus threw open the underlying&nbsp; principle to competition. From that time the numerous patents&nbsp;have had reference merely to details. Many different couplers&nbsp;of the Janney type are patented and made by different firms,&nbsp;but the tendency is to equip new cars with one of only four or&nbsp;five standard makes. The adoption of automatic couplers was&nbsp;stimulated in some degree by laws enacted by the various states&nbsp;and by the United States; and the Safety Appliance Act passed&nbsp;by Congress in 1893 made it unlawful for railways to permit to&nbsp;be hauled on their lines after the 1st of January 1898 any car&nbsp;used for interstate commerce that was not equipped with&nbsp;couplers which coupled automatically by impact, and which&nbsp;could be uncoupled without the necessity for men going in&nbsp;between the ends of the cars. The limit was extended to the&nbsp;1st of August 1900 by the Interstate Commerce Commission,&nbsp;which was given discretion in the matter.</span></p>
