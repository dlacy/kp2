<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Papieren,</span><span class="font2"> the former of which was issued in 1783-84, the latter in 1789. These works were not received with much&nbsp;favour, and in later life Richter himself had little sympathy&nbsp;with their satirical tone. His next book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Die Unsichtbare&nbsp;Loge,</span><span class="font2"> a romance, published in 1793, had all the qualities&nbsp;which were soon to make him famous, and its power was&nbsp;immediately recognized by some of the best critics of the&nbsp;day. Soon after the appearance of this book he abandoned&nbsp;his work at Schwarzenbach, and lived again with his&nbsp;mother at Hof, occasionally paying long visits to a friend&nbsp;at Baireuth. Encouraged by the reception of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Die Unsichtbare Loge,</span><span class="font2"> he sent forth in rapid succession </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hesperus&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(1794), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Biographische Belustigungen unter der Gehirnschale&nbsp;einer Riesin</span><span class="font2"> (1796), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Leben des Quintus Fixlein</span><span class="font2"> (1796),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Blumen-, Frucht-, und Dornenstikke, oder Ehestand, Tod,&nbsp;und Hochzeit des Armenadvocaten Siebenkas</span><span class="font2"> (1796-97),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Der Jubelsenior</span><span class="font2"> (1797), and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Das Kampaner Thal</span><span class="font2"> (1798).&nbsp;This series of writings secured for Richter a great place in&nbsp;German literature, and during the rest of his life every&nbsp;work he produced was welcomed by a wide circle of&nbsp;admirers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After his mother’s death he went in 1797 to Leipsic, and in the following year to Weimar, where he had much&nbsp;pleasant intercourse with Herder, by whom he was warmly&nbsp;appreciated. He did not become intimate with Goethe&nbsp;and Schiller, to both of whom his literary methods were&nbsp;repugnant ; but in Weimar as elsewhere his remarkable&nbsp;conversational powers and his genial manners made him a&nbsp;favourite in general society. He was especially liked by&nbsp;women, and Frau von Kalb, who has also a place in the&nbsp;biography of Schiller, even offered to obtain a divorce in&nbsp;order to marry him. In 1801, however, he married&nbsp;Caroline Mayer, a bright, accomplished, and amiable lady&nbsp;whom he met in Berlin in 1800. They lived first at&nbsp;Meiningen, then at Coburg; and finally, in 1804, they&nbsp;settled at Baireuth. Here Richter spent a quiet, simple,&nbsp;and happy life, constantly occupied with his work as a&nbsp;writer. In 1808 he was fortunately delivered from&nbsp;anxiety as to outward necessities by the kindness of the&nbsp;prince primate, who gave him a pension of a thousand&nbsp;florins. Before settling at Baireuth, Richter had published&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Das heimliche Klaglied der jetzigen Männer</span><span class="font2"> (1801), and&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Titan</span><span class="font2"> (1800-3); and these were followed by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Flegeljahre&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(1804-5). </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Titan</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Flegeljahre</span><span class="font2"> he regarded as his&nbsp;masterpieces, and this judgment has been confirmed by&nbsp;posterity. His later imaginative works were </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Dr Katzen-bergeds Badereise</span><span class="font2"> (1809), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Des Feldpredigers Schmelze&nbsp;Reise nach Flatz</span><span class="font2"> (1809), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Leben Fibels</span><span class="font2"> (1812), and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Der&nbsp;Komet, oder Nikolaus Marggraf (1820-22).</span><span class="font2"> In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vorschule&nbsp;der Aesthetik</span><span class="font2"> (1804) he expounded his ideas on art; he&nbsp;discussed the principles of education in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Levana, oder&nbsp;Erziehungslehre</span><span class="font2"> (1807); and the opinions suggested by&nbsp;current events he set forth in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Friedenspredigt</span><span class="font2"> (1808),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Dämmerungen für Deutschland</span><span class="font2"> (1809), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mars und PEobus&nbsp;Thronwechsel im J. 18lj</span><span class="font2"> (1814), and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Politische Fastenpredigten</span><span class="font2"> (1817). In his last years he began </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Wahrheit&nbsp;aus Jean Paul's Leben,</span><span class="font2"> to which additions from his papers&nbsp;and other sources were made after his death by C. Otto&nbsp;and E. Förster. In 1821 Richter lost his only son, a&nbsp;youth of the highest promise ; and he never quite recovered&nbsp;from this shock. He died of dropsy on the 14th&nbsp;November 1825.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Schiller said of Richter that he would have been worthy of admiration “ if he had made as good use of his riches as other men&nbsp;made of their poverty. ” And it is true that in the form of his&nbsp;writings he never did full justice to his great powers. In working&nbsp;out his conceptions he found it impossible to restrain the expression of any powerful feeling by which he might happen to be&nbsp;moved. He was equally unable to resist the temptation to bring&nbsp;in strange facts or notions which occurred to him ; and of such&nbsp;facts and notions he had a vast store, for he was an omnivorous&nbsp;reader, and forgot nothing that had ever touched his fancy or&nbsp;awakened his sympathies. Hence every one of his works is&nbsp;irregular in structure, and in some of them it is hard to detect the&nbsp;governing idea by which the relation of the parts to the whole&nbsp;is supposed to be controlled. His style, too, lacks directness,&nbsp;precision, and grace. With the main idea of a sentence he almost&nbsp;invariably associates a crowd of subordinate ideas ; and they are&nbsp;often grouped in an order so capricious and so fantastic that the&nbsp;meaning can be made out only by the closest study. The&nbsp;splendour of Richter’s genius, however, makes it easy for the class&nbsp;of readers to whom he appeals to forgive even these grave defects.&nbsp;His imagination was one of extraordinary fertility, and he had a&nbsp;surprising power of suggesting great thoughts by means of the&nbsp;simplest incidents and relations. No German prose writer has&nbsp;presented more fascinating pictures of childhood and youth, of&nbsp;friendship and love ; nor has any one shown more finely how&nbsp;sordid circumstances may evoke the noblest qualities of loyal and&nbsp;generous minds. The love of nature was one of Richter’s deepest&nbsp;pleasures, and he communicates his own delight in its beauty by&nbsp;many a description glowing with all the colour and the radiance&nbsp;of the real world. His expressions of religious feelings are also&nbsp;marked by a truly poetic spirit, for to Richter visible things were&nbsp;but the symbols of the invisible, and in the unseen realities alone&nbsp;he found elements which seemed to him to give significance and&nbsp;dignity to human life. His humour, the most distinctive of his&nbsp;qualities, cannot be dissociated from the other characteristics of&nbsp;his writings. It mingled with all his thoughts, and to some extent&nbsp;determined the form in which he embodied even his most serious&nbsp;reflections. That it is sometimes extravagant and grotesque&nbsp;cannot be disputed, but it is never harsh nor vulgar, and generally&nbsp;it springs naturally from the perception of the incongruity between&nbsp;ordinary facts and ideal laws. There are works of imaginative&nbsp;genius which we may read and enjoy without necessarily thinking&nbsp;of the author. The writer may reflect nature with so much fidelity&nbsp;that at first sight no element may seem to be imported into his&nbsp;conceptions from his personal peculiarities. But we appear always&nbsp;to see Richter’s face and to hear his voice behind the printed&nbsp;page ; and his creations are true and suggestive only in so far as&nbsp;they are (manifestations of his own inward life. This means, of&nbsp;course, that his genius was not in any important sense dramatic,&nbsp;and that he was much more closely akin to the romantic than to&nbsp;the classic school ; but it does not imply that his works produce a&nbsp;monotonous impression. Richter’s personality was so deep and&nbsp;many-sided that in every new book he had some fresh secret to&nbsp;disclose. And the more he is known through his unconscious selfrevelation the more he is loved and honoured; for we soon learn&nbsp;that with all his wilfulness and eccentricity he was a man of a pure&nbsp;and sensitive spirit, with a passionate scorn for pretence and an&nbsp;ardent enthusiasm for truth and goodness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1826-38 a complete edition of Richter's works was published in sixty-five volumes, including several posthumous works. The second edition (1840-42)&nbsp;was in thirty-three volumes, the third (1860-63) in thirty-four. There are also&nbsp;a good many volumes of Richter's correspondence. See Döring, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Leben und&nbsp;Charakteristik Richters</span><span class="font0"> (1826) ; Kunz, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jean Paul Friedrich Richter</span><span class="font0"> (1839) ; and&nbsp;Nerrlich, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jean Paul und seine Zeitgenossen</span><span class="font0"> (1876). There are two admirable&nbsp;articles on Richter in Carlyle’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Miscellanies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RICIMER, created “ comes ” of the empire under Valentinian III., was the son of a chief of the Suevi, who&nbsp;had married a daughter of Wallia king of the Visigoths.&nbsp;He was brought up at Valentinian’s court, and served&nbsp;with distinction under Aetius. In 456 a decisive naval&nbsp;victory over the Vandals off Corsica, followed soon afterwards by the defeat of their land forces near Agrigentum,&nbsp;earned for him the title of “ Deliverer of Italy ” and&nbsp;brought him within sight of the goal of his ambition.&nbsp;Having vanquished and deposed the emperor Avitus in&nbsp;October of that year, he for some time exercised every&nbsp;function of sovereignty over Italy under the title of&nbsp;“ patrician,” which he received from Leo in February 457.&nbsp;Precluded by his barbarian origin from aspiring to the&nbsp;imperial title, he consented to the elevation of Majorian&nbsp;in April 457, but, encouraged by the misfortunes of that&nbsp;brave but simple-minded soldier, he was equally ready to&nbsp;force his deposition four years afterwards (August 461).&nbsp;The puppet on whom the imperial dignity was now&nbsp;bestowed was Libius Severus, but Ricimer continued to&nbsp;command armies, negotiate alliances, and wield an independent and despotic authority over the Italian peninsula,&nbsp;although his power throughout the rest of the Western&nbsp;empire was practically neutralized by the influence of&nbsp;Marcellinus in Dalmatia and Ægidius in Gaul.
