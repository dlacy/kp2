Confusion and diſorder prevailed throughout the kingdom; and though the friends of the queen were promiſed aſſiſtance from France, nothing effectual was done for them. At laſt the regency was conferred upon the earl of Lenox an enemy to his queen, and who treated her friends  with the utmoſt rigour. At the ſame time Elizabeth continued to amuſe with negociations her unhappy rival. She granted liberty to the biſhop of Roſs to repair to the queen of Scots, who had been removed to Chatſworth, and to confer with her on the ſubject of the intended accord and treaty. Mary, conforming to the advances of Elizabeth, authoriſed the lord Levingſton to paſs to her dominions, and to deſire her friends to appoint a deputation of their number to give their aſſiſtance in promoting the ſalutary purpoſe of eſtabliſhing the tranquillity of their country: and after meeting with ſome interruptions upon the Engliſh borders from the earl of Suſſex, this nobleman executed ſucceſsfully his commiſſion. The queen’s lords gave powers to ten nobles to act in a body, or by two of their number, in the intended negociation: and a ſafe-conduct from Elizabeth allowed them to enter the Engliſh realm, and to remain in it during the ſpace of fix months.</p><p>While the lord Levingſton was conſulting the intereſts of Mary with her friends in Scotland, the biſhop of Roſs was making earneſt ſuit with Elizabeth to proceed in the projected negociation. His ſolicitations were not ineffectual; and Sir William Cecil and Sir Walter Mildmay received the inſtructions of their miſtreſs to wait upon the queen of Scots at Chatſworth. The heads of accommodation which they propoſed were explicit and particular and the rigour they diſcovered towards the Scottiſh princeſs ſeemed to vouch their ſincerity. It was propoſed, that a perfect amity ſhould take place between the two queens; that all the treaties which had formerly been concluded by the two nations ſhould receive an ample confirmation; that the queen of Scots ſhould ratify the treaty of Edinburgh, and forbear from advancing any title or claim to the crown of England during the life of Elizabeth, or to the prejudice of the heirs of her body; that in caſe of foreign invaſions, the two realms ſhould mutually aſſiſt each other; that all foreign ſoldiers ſhould be ordered to depart out of Scotland; that in the future, ſtrangers of the profeſſion of arms ſhould be prohibited from repairing to it, and from taking up their reſidence in any  of its caſtles or houſes of ſtrength; that Mary ſhould hold no correſpondence, directly or indirectly, with any ſubject of England, without the permiſſion of the Engliſh queen; that the earl of Northumberland, and the Engliſh rebels in Scotland, ſhould be delivered up to Elizabeth; that redreſs ſhould be given to the ſubjects of England for the ſpoils committed upon them by the Scottiſh borderers; that the murderers of the lord Darnley and the earl of Murray ſhould be duly and effectually puniſhed; that before the queen of Scots ſhould be ſet at liberty, the young prince her ſon ſhould be brought into England, and that he ſhould continue in the keeping of Elizabeth till the death of his mother, or till her reſignation to him of her crown on at</p><p>taining his majority; that the queen of Scots ſhould not enter into a negociation for her marriage without the knowledge of the queen of England, nor conclude it without her approbation, or that of the greateſt part of the Scottiſh nobility; that none of the ſubjects of Scotland ſhould be ſuffered to go to Ireland without the ſafe-conduct of Elizabeth; and that Mary ſhould deliver to her ſiſter all the teſtimonies and writings which had been ſent from France, renouncing and diſavowing the pretended marriage between her and the duke of Anjou. Beſides theſe articles of agreement, it was propoſed by another treaty to adjuſt the differences of the queen of Scots and her ſubjects; and Sir William Cecil and Sir Walter Mildmay embraced the preſent opportunity of conferring with her upon this buſineſs, under the pretence of facilitating its management in the future ſtages of its progreſs.</p><p>During their ſtay at Chatſworth, theſe ſtateſmen were completely ſatisfied with the behaviour of the queen of Scots. The candour, ſincerity, and moderation, which fhe diſplayed, were full aſſurances to them that upon her part there was no occaſion to apprehend any improper policy or art; and the calamities of her condition were a ſtill ſecurer pledge of her compliance. Elizabeth, upon hearing their report, affected to be highly pleaſed with her ſiſter, and ſent a meffage to the earl of Lenox, inſtructing him in the conditions which had been ſubmitted to Mary; and deſiring him to diſpatch commiſſioners into England to deliberate in the treaty, and to conſult his intereſt and that of his faction. Nor did Mary neglect to tranſmit to her friends in Scotland the propoſed terms of agreement; and the biſhop of Roſs, who had aſſiſted her in the conferences with Sir William Cecil and Sir Walter Mildmay, conveyed intimations of them to the pope, the king of France, and the duke of Alva; beſought their advice, and informed theſe princes, that unleſs an effectual relief could be expected from their favour, the neceſſities of her condition would compel her to ſubſcribe to the hard and humiliating dictates of the queen of England.</p><p>But while Mary and her friends were indulging the hope of a termination to her troubles, Elizabeth was ſecretly giving comfort to her adverſaries, and encouraging them to throw obſtacles in the way of the treaty. Sir William Cecil wrote to the regent, expreſsing his diſapprobation of the negociations at Chatſworth; deſiring him not to be apprehenſive of the boaſtings of the adherents of the queen of Scots; and adviſing him to make choice of commiſſioners, in the name of the king, in whoſe conſtancy and fortitude he could rely, and whom no addreſs could allure from his intereſt, or from the common cauſe in which he and his friends were embarked. The earl of Suſſex alſo ſent him diſpatches, in which he admoniſhed him to turn his anxious attention to the approaching negociation, and to inſiſt on ſecure ſtipulations for the preſervation of the prince, for his own ſafety, and for a general indemnity to the nobles and their adherents, whoſe party he had eſpouſed. In every event, he repreſented it as proper for him to pay the greateſt reſpect to Elizabeth; and, if no treaty ſhould be concluded, he adviſed him to be prepared for reducing the friends of Mary to obedience, and for defending himſelf againſt invaſions from abroad.
