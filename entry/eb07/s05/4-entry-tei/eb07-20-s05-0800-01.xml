 Duke of, was born at Rosny on the 13th of December 1560, and died at Villebon on the 22d of December 1640. His name is so conspicuous in the public annals of France, that a mere outline of his personal history would require an ample allotment of space. He participated in the fortunes of Henry IV. and rendered him the most important services in the cabinet as well as the field. He was grand master of the artillery, and superintendent of the finances. Rigidly attentive to the interest of the king, he had no disposition to neglect his own ; and in the course of a long life he accumulated an immense fortune, of which he laid the foundation by his marriage with Anne de Courtenay, a rich heiress. He was remarkable for his decision of character and bluntness of manners ; and in spite of all the allurements presented to him, he steadily adhered to the protestant faith. The Memoirs of Sully furnish some of the most curious and valuable materials for the history of that eventful era.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
