Between the dry and the wet season a period intervenes when those terrific visitations, the tornadoes, prevail, and which are in general accompanied by violent thunder-storms. During the rainy season the heat is suffocating and the air loaded with humidity. Bad fevers are then common, and multitudes of insects and crawling vermin swarm in the air and on the ground, the torment and terror of man. Towards the end of the rainy season the harmatta begins to blow from the Sahara, which, although troublesome in itself, dries up the soaked ground, and purifies the air from its pernicious miasmata.</p><p>The mountains of Kong are more rich in water than any other part of Africa. Great numbers of rivers of various sizes descend its declivities, and after traversing large tracts of country, find their embouchure in the Atlantic Ocean. The most important are, the Rio Grande, the Gambia, and the Senegal, each of which is described under its own head ; the Rio Nunez, which originates in the high table-lands in the interior, and, without having a very long course, is abundant in water ; the Katherine and the Domingo, or the Upper and Lower Geba, originating in the table-land of Mandingo, and forming during its course a large lake, whence a considerable river flows to the sea, where it has deposited an extensive delta. From this point to the embouchure of the Gambia, numerous rivers or arms of the sea intersect the flat coast like net-work, so that between 10° and 14° of north latitude it appears as if partitioned into numberless islands. In front of this maritime tract extends a long bank of sand, out of which the islands called the Bissagos have been formed.</p><p>The inhabitants consist of Moors and Negroes, which races present a remarkable contrast in respect to their physiognomy, hair, colour, manners and customs, and the like. To the last-named people belong the Jallofs, situated between the Senegal and the Gambia. They are a fine specimen of the negro. Their colour is of a deep glossy black, of which they are very proud, and also of their ancient origin. The Mandingoes, who are partly Mahommedans, are situated on the Gambia; but, on account of their trade, they have colonies scattered over the interior of Africa. The Soosoos lie between the sources of the Gambia and the Senegal. The Feloops are scattered along the banks of the Lower Gambia, in Casamansa, and St Domingo. The Serawoollies occupy the kingdoms of Galam and Senegal. The Serreres, or Seraires, are distributed in little republics on the borders of the kingdom of Kayor ; and the Rappels are situated on the south side of the St Domingo, and on the Bissagos islands. The Foulahs, on the Senegal, the same race which in Soudan is called the Fel- latahs, are not true negroes ; they have silken hair, and a reddish or olive complexion. Amongst those tribes which have more recently become known to us, we have to mention the Timmanees, whose principal place is Rokon, on the river Rokelle, some miles distant from the colony of Sierra Leone. From their youth they accustom themselves so much to drinking palm wine, that they get into a relaxed and effeminate state at a very early age. The Koorankas are mixed with the Mandingoes. They go constantly armed, usually with a firelock and dagger. Lastly, the Soolimas are a gay, thoughtless, stirring race, whose principal town is called Falaba, not far from the sources of the rivers Rokelle and Kabba. The principal languages spoken are the Jallof, Mandingo, Serawool, Soosoo, Arabic, Portuguese, and many varying dialects formed out of these.</p><p>In the trade of Senegambia, the English, French, Dutch, Danes, and North Americans participate. The exports consist of slaves, which, however, are of less value than those of Guinea; skins of tigers, and other animals; wax, hides, ivory, gums, cotton, and the like. England obtains</p><p>ivory and gold from the countries situated between Cape Blanco and Cape Negro, and gives in return such of her own manufactures as are required. The trade in gold amounts to 30,000 ounces yearly.</p><p>Of the numerous kingdoms and countries into which the vast territory of Senegambia is partitioned, there will be found described in this work, each under its own head, <hi rend="smallcaps">Βαμβοοκ, Bissagos, Bondoo,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Kajaaga.</hi> There still remain unnoticed a considerable number, of which we shall here present a brief account.</p><p>1. The land of the Foulahs consists of a number of provinces or kingdoms, interspersed throughout the tract comprehended between the mountainous border of the country of Sierra Leone on the west and that of Timbuctoo on the east, as also a large tract on both sides of the Senegal, and several districts on the Gambia ; these provinces being insulated from each other in a very remarkable manner. The principal of the Foulah states is that within Sierra Leone, and of which Temboo is the capital. The next in order appears to be that bordering on the south of the Senegal river, and on the Jallofs. Others of less note lie between the rivers Gambia and Falemé ; Foola-doo and Brooko are situated along the upper part of the Senegal ; Was- sela, beyond the upper part of the Niger ; and Massina, lower down on the same river, adjoining Timbuctoo on the west. Amongst other districts belonging to the Foulahs may be mentioned Morfil or Ivory Island, Bilbos, and other islands of the river Senegal. On the former is a French factory, at a place called St Podhor, which is fortified. A trade in gum is here carried on. Not fur from the sources of the Senegal, and three hundred and seventy miles inland, are situated, on the mountains of Kong, the towns of Temboo, which has eight thousand inhabitants, and Ladi, which has five thousand inhabitants. In both are Maraboot schools ; and some trade is carried on in iron, silk, and leather. The other towns it is unnecessary to enumerate, nor can the whole number of inhabitants in the land of the Foulahs be ascertained. 2. Ludamar, situated on the borders of the Sahara. It is ruled over by a Moorish king, who resides at Benowm. On the borders of the neighbouring kingdom of Kaarta lies Tsharra, where the unfortunate Houghton met his fate. 3. The land of the Jallofs or Yolofs, comprising four territories or governments, and situated near the sea-coast, in the region between the rivers Senegal and Gambia. This country is rich in provisions, cattle, and poultry, and flourishes under a more regular administration than that of the adjoining states. The people manufacture cotton goods. The chief ruler bears the title of emperor of the Jallofs, and resides at Hikarkor, the principal town. The states separated from the Jallof empire, such as those of Baol and Cayor, are governed by a prince, who bears the title of Damel. 4. Sin, or Barb-Sin, for the most part situated on the north of the Gambia, has a hundred and forty square leagues of territory, and contains sixty thousand inhabitants. The regent, who is called Boor, has his principal seat at Joal, a seaport, formed by the mouth of the river of that name. There is a trade carried on in cattle, poultry, rice, slaves, wax, hides, and ivory. <hi rend="italic">5.</hi> Boorsali, or Salum, situated on a river of the same name, which discharges itself into the Atlantic in latitude 13° 44' north. It comprehends a surface of 1500 square miles, and contains 300,000 inhabitants. The principal place, and the residence of the king, is called Calyoon. Upon the Gambia are situated Kahan or Cahon, and Cower or Kayee, where cotton-weaving is carried on. 6. Bar or Barrah, situated at the mouth of the Gambia, has an area of 700 square miles, and contains 200,000 inhabitants, who arc Mahommedans. There are here public schools, so that it must have risen above the barbarism of most of the surrounding states. The country is tributary to Salum, and is governed by regents of circumscribed authority. The principal town is called Ba-</p></body></text></TEI>
