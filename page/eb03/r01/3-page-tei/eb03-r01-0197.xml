They ſeized at the fame time the military cheſt, and ſent a deputa-tion to ſtate their caſe at Paris to the national aſſembly. But the officers were before-hand, and prepoffeſſed the miniſter of war againſt them ; upon whoſe repreſentation a decree was paſſed, authoriſing the commander in chief of the province, M. Bouille, to reduce the inſurgents by force. This was no ſooner known, than the national guard of Nancy affembled, and ſent a deputation to give a fair ſtatement of facts. But Bouille, without waiting the refult of an explanation, haſtened to Nancy at. the head of all the troops he could ſudden-Iv collect ; and having fallen upon the regiments of Chateauvieux and Meſtre de Camp, after putting an immenſe multitude to the ſword, he took 4.00 priſoners.</p><p>The King’s regiment was prevented from acting againſt Bouille by thc intrepidity of a young officer of tlie name <hi rend="italic">Deſſt/es,</hi>  who, however, died of the wounds w hich he received on the occaſion. Tile news of theſe events filled Paris with indignation. The aſſembly afterwards reverſcd its own decrees againſt thc inſnrgents at Nancy. Public honours were decreed to the memory of Deffillcs ; but Bouille could not be puniſhed, becauſe he had only acted in obedience to authority.</p><p>M. Neckar’s popularity had been gradually declining, as he was unwilling to go all the lengths that the ruling party wiſhed. He gave in his reſignation on the 4th of September, and ſpeedily thereafter left the kingdom. He was regretted by no party. He was regarded, on the one ſide, as having conducted the kingdom to its ruin, by the conceffions which he originally adviſed the king to make in favour of the <hi rend="italic">tiers etat ; </hi>while he was deſpiſed by the oppoſite party as a lukewarm politician, of narrow views, and a feeble mind. He departed, however, with thé unblemiſhed reputation of ſtrict integrity. M. Neckar does not ſeem to have penetrated deeply into the characters of men, or to have had any conception of the effects of that terrible and reſtleſs energy which is called forth in a nation which attempts to make important changes in its ancient manners and government. Having no conception of the important era which was about to open upon that country of which he was the miniſter, lie was ſar from being qualified to direct or controul it amidſt the convulſions which it was deſtined to encounter. Unable to brook thc loſs of his popularity, he peeviſhly retired to Swiſſerland, where he publiſhed a work, which ſhows to the conviction of every unprejudiced reader the integrity of the French king, and the wicked projects of the leading democrates, whom he himſelf had armed with power.</p><p>The remaining part of tin’s year was occupied in attempts to introduce ſome degree of ſubordination into the navy of France, which had been much diſorganized, and in farther regulating the affairs of the clergy. It was now declared, that ſuch clergymen as ſhould not take the foliowing oath, which had been preſcribed ſome months before, ſhsuld be conſidered as ejected from their benefices : " To watch carefully over the faithful in the pariſh or dioceſe which was entruſted to Iſis care ; to be faithſul to the nation, the law, and the king ; and to maintain to the utmoſt of his power the new conſtitution of France, and particularly the decrees relative to thc civil conſtitution oſ the clergy.” This decree rendered the ſituation of conſcientious men etu tremely perplexing ; eſpecialIy as the pope teſtiſied in marked terms his diſapprobation of the oath. The people were reduced to the dilemma of dhooſing be-tween their new political and their old religious preju-dſces, and the reſult was extremely unfavourable to the intereſt of religion.</p><p>The aſſembly commenced the new year with a decree, announcing the termination of its ſeſſion, which was to take place as foon as it ſhould have finiſhed the diſcuf· lion of a liſt of conſtitutioual articles. In the mean time, on the ſide of Germany, Spain, Italy, and Savoy, hoſtile appearances began to be exhibited, and bodies of troops advanced around the French frontier. The Emperor Leopold was, however, too cautious to announce his intentions ; and the King foon communica-ted a letter from him, containing proteſtations of amicable diſpoſitions, but addin&lt;r, that " the innovations occaſioned by the decrees of the 4th of Auguſt ought to bc done away.” The King treated this merely a» an official meaſure on the part of the Emperor, that he might not appear to renounce the claims of certain German princes connected with Lorraine and Alſace. But the aſſembly expreſſed ſome alarm, and voted an augmentation of the national force. About this period. ſeveral new efforts were made by the diſaffected clergy in various parts of the kingdom to excite diſturbances, which it is unneceſſary to mention in detail. On the 20th of February the public attention was rouſed by a circumſtance that in any other ſtate of affairs would have been accounted unimportant. The King announced to the aſſembly, that his aunts, the daughters of Louis XV. had that morning left Paris ; but as hc did not appre-hend that the exiſting laws laid them under any reſtraint in this reſpect, he had not oppoſed their departure. Aſter ſome debate,, the aſſembly agreed that the King had judged well ; and theſc princeſſes were left to purſue their journey to Rome, which they reached after ſome delays occaſioned by the jealouſy of certain municipalities through which they paſſed. Thus the-kingdom was gradually deſerted by every branch of the royal family, excepting the King and his eldeſt brother Monſieur. ſ he aſſembly, however, continued its Ia-bours with conſiderable quietneſa. In the end' of the month of March died the celebrated M. de Mirabeau, at the age of 42 years; a man whoſe integrity has for many good reaſons been much ſuſpected, but whoſe political addreſs- and intrepidity, and whoſe ſplendid powers of eloquence, have been ſeldom equalled. He re-ceived from his countrymen at his death marks of re-</p><p>ſpect unparalleled in modern hiſtory. During his ſhort illneſs, his door was bcſieged by anxious citizens. A-mourning of eight days was dccreed by the aſſembIy, and alſo a grand proceffion, which, was attendcd by all the public functionaries. He was the firſt who"was· interred in the new magnificent Pantheon, conſecrated to the reception of the remains of illuſtrious men. But his aſhes were afterwards removed, in conſequence of very clear proofs that he had not been incorruptible by money.</p><p>During the whole of thisſpring, much fear was en-tertained that ſome attempts at a counter revolution were about to be made. The emigrant army aſſembled on the borders of Alſace was reviewed by the prince of Condé. Their uniform was· black, faced with yellow,</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
