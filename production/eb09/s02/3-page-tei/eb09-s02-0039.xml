Hermann was born on the 13th of May 1826. His first scientific labours were studies in the Alps, carried on between 1846 and 1848 in association with his brother Adolf (born January 9, 1829). The publication of the <hi rend="italic">Studien über die physikalische Geographie der Alpen</hi> in 1850 founded the scientific reputation of the two brothers, and their reputation was increased by their subsequent investigations in the same field, in which the third brother Robert (born Oct. 27, 1837) also took part. Soon after the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Neue Untersuchungen über die phys. Geog. u. Geol. der Alpen</hi> (1854, 4to), the three brothers received, on the recommendation of Alex von Humboldt, a commission from the East India Company to travel for scientific purposes in their territory, and more particularly to make observations on terrestrial magnetism. Their explorations extended over the period 1854-57, during which they travelled, sometimes in company, sometimes separately, in the Deccan and in the region of the Himalayas, even prosecuting their investigations beyond the frontiers of the Company’s territory into the region of the Karakorum and Kuenlun Mountains. Hermann and Robert were the first Europeans who crossed the latter mountains, and it was in honour of that achievement that the former had the title or surname of Sakünlünski bestowed upon him (in 1864). The two returned to Europe in the summer of 1857, but Adolf, who remained to prosecute his explorations in Central Asia, was put to death by the emir of Kashgar on the 26th of August. Between 1860 and 1866 Hermann and Robert published in four volumes the “ Results of a Scientific Mission to India and High Asia.” The extensive collections of ethnography and natural history made by them were ultimately deposited in the Burg at Nuremberg through the intervention of the king of Bavaria (May 1877). Hermann spent the last years of his life chiefly in literary and scientific activity, partly at Munich partly at the castle of Jägernburg near Forchheim. He died at Munich on the 19th of January 1882.</p><p>His brother Robert was appointed professor of geography at Giessen in 1864, but his academical labours were sometimes interrupted by travels, especially in the United States, which furnished him with material for more or less important works. He died at Giessen, June 6, 1885. Of two other brothers, one, Edward (born March 23, 1831), killed in battle at Kissingen in 1866, made himself known by an account of the Spanish expedition to Morocco in 1859-60. Emil (born July 7, 1835) is the author of several learned works relating to India and Tibet.</p><p>SCHLANGENBAD. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Schwalbach.</hi></p><p>SCHLEGEL, <hi rend="smallcaps">August Wilhelm von</hi> (1767-1845), German poet, translator, and critic, was born on the 8th September 1767 at Hanover, where his father, J. Adolf Schlegel, was a pastor. He was educated at the Hanover gymnasium and at the university of Göttingen. Having spent some years as a tutor in the house of a banker at Amsterdam, he went to Jena, where he was made a professor, and received from the duke of Weimar the title of “ Rath.” Here he began his translation of Shakespeare, which was ultimately completed, under the superintendence of Tieck, by Tieck’s daughter Dorothea and Count Baudissin. A revised edition of this rendering, which is considered one of the best poetical translations in the German language, has been issued by the German Shakespeare society. At Jena Schlegel contributed to Schiller’s periodicals the <hi rend="italic">Horen</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Musenalmanach</hi> ; and with his brother Friedrich he conducted the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> which ranked among the most powerful organs of critical opinion in Germany. He also published a volume of poems, and carried on a rather bitter controversy with Kotzebue. At</p><p> this time the two brothers were remarkable for the vigour and freshness of their ideas, and commanded respect as the leaders of the rising Romantic school. In 1802 Schlegel went to Berlin, where he delivered lectures on art and literature ; and in the following year he issued <hi rend="italic">Ion,</hi> a tragedy in the antique style, which gave rise to a suggestive discussion on the principles of dramatic poetry. About the same time appeared his <hi rend="italic">Spanish Theatre,</hi> in which he presented admirable translations of five of Calderon’s plays ; and in another volume he gave translations of Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian lyrics. In 1807 he attracted much attention in France by an essay in the French language, in which he compared Racine with Euripides. His lectures on dramatic art and literature, which have been translated into most European languages, were delivered at Vienna in 1808. Meanwhile he had been travelling in France, Germany, Italy, and other countries with Madame de Staël, who owed to him many of the ideas which she embodied in her work, <hi rend="italic">De l'Allemagne.</hi> In 1813 he acted as the secretary of the crown prince of Sweden, through whose influence the right of his family to noble rank was revived. Schlegel was made a professor at the university of Bonn in 1818, and during the remainder of his life he occupied himself chiefly with Oriental studies, although he continued to lecture on art and literature, and in 1828 he issued two volumes of critical writings. In 1823-30 he published the <hi rend="italic">Indische Bibliothek ;</hi> and as separate works appeared (1823) the <hi rend="italic">Bhagavad-Gîta</hi> with a Latin translation, and (1829) the <hi rend="italic">Râmâjana.</hi> Schlegel was twice married—first to a daughter of Prof. Michaelis of Göttingen, then to a daughter of Prof. Paulus of Heidelberg. Both wives separated from him soon after their marriage. He died at Bonn on the 12th May 1845. As an original poet Schlegel is unimportant, but as a poetical translator he has rarely been excelled, and in criticism he exercised a strong influence by the emphasis with which he marked the distinction between classical and romantic literature. By his study of Sanskrit he helped to prepare the way for the development of the science of language.</p><p>In 1846-47 Schlegel’s German works were issued in twelve volumes by Booking. There is also an edition of his <hi rend="italic">Œuvres, écrites en français,</hi> and of his <hi rend="italic">Opuscula Latina.</hi></p><p>SCHLEGEL, <hi rend="smallcaps">Johann Elias</hi> (1718—1749), a German dramatic writer, was born at Meissen on the 28th January 1718. He was educated at Schulpforta and at the university of Leipsic. In 1743, having finished his studies, he became private secretary to his relative, Von Spener, the Saxon ambassador at the Danish court. Afterwards he was made professor extraordinary at the academy of Soröe, where he died on the 13th August 1749. Schlegel was a contributor to the <hi rend="italic">Bremischen Beiträge,</hi> and for some time, while he was living in Denmark, he edited a weekly periodical, <hi rend="italic">Der Fremde.</hi> He was also known as a writer of clever poetical epistles. Incomparably his best works, however, are his dramas, which did much to prepare the way for the dramatic achievements of Lessing, by whom his genius was warmly appreciated. He wrote two lively and well-constructed comedies, the <hi rend="italic">Triumph der guten Frauen</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Stumme Schönheit,</hi> the latter in alexandrines, the former in prose. <hi rend="italic">Hermann</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Kanut </hi>(in alexandrines) are generally considered his best tragedies.</p><p>His works were edited after his death by his brother, J. H. Schlegel, who had a considerable reputation as a writer on Danish history. Another brother, J. Adolf Schlegel, an eminent preacher, and author of some volumes of verse, was the father of August Wilhelm and Friedrich von Schlegel.</p><p>SCHLEGEL, <hi rend="smallcaps">Karl Wilπelm Friedrich von</hi> (1772- 1829), known chiefly as an historian of literature, was the brother of August Wilhelm von Schlegel.
