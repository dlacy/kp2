                <p><label>ROPE</label> and ROPE-MAKING. All varieties of cordage having a
                    circumference of an inch or more are known by the general name of “ rope.”
                    Twisted cordages of smaller dimensions are called cords, twines and lines, and
                    when the sectional area is still smaller, the article is known as thread or
                    doubled yarn. All these varieties of cordage are composed of a number of
                    separate yarns, each of which is made from some kind of textile fibre by
                    preparing and spinning machinery. The number of separate yarns which ultimately
                    form the rope or cord depends upon the fineness of the yam, and also upon the
                    circumference of the finished article. From thread and fine twine upwards the
                    whole art of manufacture is that of twisting together fibres and yams; but the
                    comparative heaviness and coarseness of the materials operated on in rope-making
                    render necessary the adoption of heavy machinery and modified processes which
                    clearly define this manufacture as a distinct calh’ng. The modem trade of
                    rope-making is again divided into two distinct branches dealing with vegetable
                    fibres and metallic wire.</p>
                <p>Many different vegetable fibres are used for rope-making, but for the combined
                    qualities of strength, flexibility and durability, none can compete yvith the
                    common hemp, which is consequently the staple of the rope-maker. Cotton ropes
                    are, however, much more flexible, and in addition are strong and durable; they
                    are, therefore, much preferred for power transmission in textile and other
                    works. Manila hemp is a fibre of remarkable tenacity, of unapproached value for
                    heavy cordage, but too stiff for small cords and twines. After these in utility
                    come Sisal hemp of Central America <hi rend="italic">(Agava Sisalana),</hi>
                    Phormium hemp of New Zealand <hi rend="italic">(Phormium tenax}</hi> and Sunn
                    hemp of the East Indies <hi rend="italic">(Crotalaria juncea)—</hi> all fibres
                    of great strength, and largely used by rope-makers. Jute <hi rend="italic"
                        >(q.v.)</hi> of India <hi rend="italic">(Corchorus capsularis</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">C. olitorus)</hi> is now largely used by rope-makers on
                    account of its cheapness. When used alone it is deficient in strength and
                    durability, but when used in conjunction with proper proportions of hemp it
                    makes a very satisfactory and useful rope. Among fibres more rarely seen in
                    rope-works are Jubbulpore hemp <hi rend="italic">(Crotalaria tenuifolia),</hi>
                    boxstring hemp <hi rend="italic">(Sanseviera zeylanica),</hi> and other hemps of
                    the East Indies, plantain fibre <hi rend="italic">(Musa paradisica),</hi> and
                    agave fibre <hi rend="italic">(Agave americana)</hi> of America. Coir and many
                    other fibres are used, but principally in the locab’ties of their
                    production.</p>
                <p>A rope is composed of a certain number of <hi rend="sup">a</hi> strands,” the
                    strand itself being made up of a number of single threads or yarns. Three
                    strands laid or twisted together form a “ hawser-laid ” rope, and three | such
                    hawsers similarly laid make a “ cable-laid ” rope or “ cable.” A “ shroud-laid ”
                    rope usually consists of four strands laid around a central strand or core. The
                    prepared fibre is twisted or spun to the right hand to form yarn; the required
                    numher of yams receive a left-hand twist to make a strand; three strands twisted
                    to the right make a hawser; and three hawsers twisted to the left form a cable.
                    Thus the twist in each operation is in a different direction from that of the
                    preceding one, and this alternation of direction serves, to some extent, to
                    preserve the parallelism of the fibres.</p>
                <p>The primary object of twisting fibres together in a rope is that by mutual
                    friction they may [be held together when a strain is applied to the whole. Hard
                    twisting has the further advantage of compacting the fibres and preventing, to
                    some extent, the penetration of moisture when the ropes are exposed to water;
                    but the yield of rope from a given length of yam diminishes in proportion to the
                    increase of twist. The proper degree of twist given to ropes is generally such
                    that the rope is from three-fourths to two-thirds the length of yarn composing
                    it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rope-walk Spinning.</hi> —The sequence of operations in this
                    method of working is as follows: (i) hackling the fibre; (2) spinning the yarn;
                    (3) tarring the yam when necessary; (4) forming the strands; (5) laying the
                    strands into ropes.</p>
                <p>Hackling differs but slightly from the hand-hackling process used in the
                    preparation of flax. The hackle board consists of a wooden block studded with
                    strong, tapered and sharp-pointed steel prongs. A series of such hackle boards
                    is used in the progressive hackling operation, the prongs diminishing</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0714" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0763.jp2"/>
                <p>in size and being more closely set together. For the commoner kinds of ropes,
                    however, hackling through the coarsest board is found to be sufficient, while in
                    most other cases two hacklings are adopted.</p>
                <p>The hackler takes up a handful or “streak” <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial" n="1"> See note in the article on <hi rend="smallcaps"
                            >Jute</hi> for variations of spelling. </note> of hemp from the bundle,
                    wraps one end firmly round his hand, and with his fingers distributes a little
                    oil over the hemp. The oil softens the material, keeps the hackle pins in good
                    condition, and facilitates generally the splitting up of the fibre as the streak
                    is drawn through the pins. In the first place, only the'ends of the streak are
                    hackled; they are dashed into the pins and drawn through them in order to
                    separate the fibres and to lay them parallel; but as the operation proceeds a
                    gradually increasing length of the streak is thrown on and drawn through the
                    pins. The process is indeed very similar to the combing out of a head of human
                    hair. When half the length of the streak is thoroughly combed, the other half is
                    treated in precisely the same manner. The hackled streak is then weighed,
                    doubled up to prevent any entanglement, and laid aside for the process of
                    spinning. During the hackling process a large quantity of comparatively short
                    fibres are retained in the pins; the longest of these are separated, and the
                    remainder used for tow yams. The above description refers entirely to hand
                    hackling; machine hackling of hemp is very similar to flax hackling.</p>
                <p>The spinning is done in what is, termed the “ rope-walk,” and from the nature of
                    hand-spinning, and the length of the rope required, it is necessary that this
                    walk should be from 300 to 400 yds. in length. It is sometimes completely
                    covered in with walls and roof; at other times only a roof is built; while in
                    exceptional cases the whole of the walk, with the exception of a small hut at
                    each end, is without shelter of any kind. The operation of spinning is very
                    important, as the weight of the yarn and the appearance of the finished product
                    depend upon it. A description of spinning and laying as performed by the aid of
                    the hand-wheel will perhaps be the best means of giving an idea of this useful
                    branch of manufacture.</p>
                <p>The front and end elevations of one variety of spinning-wheel are shown in figs.
                    1 and 2. The apparatus is fixed to some convenient part of the building, or to
                    special supports. The wheel A, which is turned by hand, and always in the same
                    direction, communicates motion to the rotating hooks or “ whirls ” B, C, D and E
                    by means of a listing band or strap F. The arrangement of the listing shows
                    clearly that the hook E will revolve in the opposite direction to hooks B, C,
                    and D. The spinner takes two streaks of the hackled hemp, wraps them round his
                    waist with the ends at his back, and keeps the fibre in position by adjusting
                    his apron partly round it. From the middle of the streak—that is, midway between
                    the two ends —he takes hold of a quantity of fibre and hangs it on to one of the
                    hooks B, C or D ; the assistant at the wheel begins to turn, and thus a certain
                    amount of twist is imparted to the material between the spinner and the hook.
                    The spinner now walks backwards down the walk, drawing out the fibre with his
                    left hand and adjusting it with his right. A piece of flannel or woollen cloth
                    held in his right hand aids in the formation of the thread and protects his
                    fingers from the rough fibre. In some cases two threads are spun simultaneously;
                    when this is done, two of the hooks, say B and C, are used at the same time.
                    Since the revolutions of the hook divided by the length of yarn spun give the
                    amount of twist per inch or foot, it follows that the ratio of the walking pace
                    of the spinner to the revolutions of the wheel A should be constant, otherwise
                    the yarn will not be uniform. The spinner calls to the assistant when there is
                    any irregularity in speed, or when, from any cause, he is obliged to stop
                    walking.</p>
                <p>At convenient intervals in the length of the walk, and projecting from posts, are
                    short horizontal bars; the top of each bar is provided with wires or pegs to
                    form a number of vertical partitions something like a very coarse comb. As the
                    spinner proceeds down the walk, he throws the spun yarn into one of these
                    partitions, thus relieving himself of the weight and keeping the yarn off the
                    ground. When a sufficient length of yarn has been spun, he breaks off the fibres
                    and fastens the yarn to a convenient peg or hook until he has spun a sufficient
                    number (usually three) to form a small rope or cord. The person at the wheel
                    hangs these three yarns one on each of the three hooks B, G and D, while the
                    spinner attaches the other ends to a revolving hook termed a “ looper.” All is
                    now ready for “ laying ” the yarns. For small cords, this may be done, with or
                    without a “ top.” This top is a conical-shaped piece of hard wood provided with
                    three equidistant grooves which merge towards each other at the thin end, and
                    into which the yarns arc laid. The thick end of the top is nearest the wheel, so
                    that the yarns may be kept separate on that side. As the hooks twist the three
                    threads, the spinner goes up the walk with the top; the twist in the yarns
                    causes the looping hook to revolve in the opposite direction to the other hooks,
                    and thus it twists the three threads in the opposite direction to the original
                    twist.</p>
                <p>Fig. 3 shows one form of top, the three yarns being shown in distinctive marks so
                    that the path of each may be more easily followed by the reader ; a plan of the
                    thick end of the top appears to the left of the figure. If four yarns of strands
                    are required, the top would contain four grooves, as well as a hole .through the
                    centre to admit of a core when such a thing is required. As soon as the spinner,
                    who carries the top, arrives at the wheel, the assistant takes the yarns off
                    hooks B, C and D (figs. I and 2), and puts them all on hook E. The other ends of
                    the strands are removed from the looper and attached to a block of wood called a
                    “ drag.” The wheel is then rotated as before, which puts more twist into the
                    cord. While this operation, which is termed hardening, proceeds, a shrinkage in
                    the length of the cord takes place, and the drag is consequently drawn up the
                    walk. The drag, however, holds the cord taut, and serves to retain the twist
                    which is imparted by the hook E.</p>
                <p>If the strands require tarring before they are laid, they are separately taken
                    off the hooks, after they have been spun, and tied at both ends to pegs to keep
                    them taut until a sufficient number has collected to be conveniently handled at
                    the tarring tank. The tar is heated to about 220° F., and the strands are then
                    passed through it at a speed not greater than 15 ft. per minute. Before emerging
                    from the tank, the strands pass between squeezing rollers which remove all
                    superfluous tar. In a short time the strands are dry, while in the space of a
                    few days the tar is hard enough to allow the strands to be formed into
                    ropes.</p>
                <p>Such is, in general, the hand process of forming ropes when they are composed of
                    only three or four single yarns. It very often happens, however, that a number
                    of single yarns are required to form each strand of the rope. The single yarns
                    may be spun by hand, as described above, or by machinery. In the former case a
                    group of yarns is usually termed a “ haul,” while the machine-spun yarns are
                    formed into what is known as a “ warp ” or “ chain?’ In any case, the group of
                    yarns is stretched down the rope-walk, at each end of which is a “ jack ”
                    twister. A few of the yarns taken from the group—the number depending upon the
                    size of the yarn and also upon the required diameter of the strand—are then
                    placed on a hook of the jack twister and twisted together. .When three such
                    strands are made they are laid into a rope in a similar manner to that explained
                    above. A simple form of hand jack twister is illustrated in figs. 4 and 5. The
                    wheel A gears with pinions B on the shafts of the hooks or whirls, and this
                    imparts the necessary motion to the latter. At the other end of the walk is a
                    similar machine which moves upon rails as the twist is put into the strands.
                    When the hooks are empty, pinions B and wheel A (fig. 4) are out of gear, but
                    those hooks carrying yarn are drawn out, as shown at C, until the pinion B gears

                <p><hi rend="italic">Machine or Factory Rope-Making.—</hi> The most modern methods
                    of rope-making are far superior to the foregoing, which, as stated, have been
                    introduced to show the principle. One of the greatest drawbacks in the formation
                    of a strand from a haul or chain, even for a small number of yarns, is the
                    irregularity of the tension of the yarns at different parts of the strand. If a
                    large number of yarns be required for each strand, it would be almost impossible
                    to make a satisfactory rope by the above system. If, however, the strand be made
                    from bobbins, each yarn bears its proper share of the tension, and an almost
                    perfect rope is obtained.</p>
                <p>Two mechanical methods are in use for the spinning of long vegetable fibres—the
                    ordinary and the special. When flax or jute yarns are required, they are almost
                    invariably spun on the ordinary spinning frames, and the yarn rewound from the
                    spinning bobbins on warping bobbins, or else rewound in the shape of rolls or
                    cheeses. Hemp yarns, especially the finer kinds, are sometimes treated in the
                    same manner, but Manila hemp, New Zealand hemp <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Phormium),</hi> and similar fibres, are invariably spun on bobbins by
                    special machinery. The strands for light ropes may then be made on the twisting
                    frames, and the rope finished on what is called a “ house machine.”</p>
                <p>• When a large rope is desired, a slightly different method is usually employed.
                    The bobbins from the automatic spinner, or the rolls from the winding frame, are
                    placed upon pegs in a frame which answers the same purpose as a bank or creel
                    used in conjunction with a warping machine. If the rope is to be say 31 in. in
                    ^circumference, there may be, with fine yams, 300 or more individual threads in
                    its composition. Suppose that 300 threads are to be used, then 300 bobbins would
                    be placed on the pegs of the bobbin bank or creel, and divided into three sets
                    of 100* threads each for . a three-strand rope. The threads are passed
                    separately through a register* plate, which is simply a plate containing a
                    sufficient number of holes for the maximum quantity required, and arranged in a
                    series of concentric circles. There are. three sets of concentric rings used in
                    the plate for a three-strand rope, and four sets for one of four strands. As the
                    threads emerge from the register plate they are grouped together and passed
                    through a tapered tube, the sectional area of the smaller end of the tube being
                    equal to the sectional area of the strand. This operation is done for each group
                    of 100 threads, and finally the three or four groups arc attached to separate
                    rotating hooks of the forming machine or “ traveller.” As the latter moves down
                    the walk on rails, it</p>
                <p>draws the threads from the bobbins in the bank, and through</p>
                <p>the register plate and tubes, while the hooks put in the twist. A perfectly
                    circular strand, without slack threads, is thus formed; and, at the same time, a
                    uniform strand is obtained, since the ratio of the speed of the traveller to the
                    number of turns per inch of the hooks is constant. The process is continued
                    until the desired length of strand is made—about 150 fathoms (300 yds.) of each
                    of the three strands are required for 100 to 120 fathoms of rope—then a little
                    more twist is introduced. Afterwards, all three strands are placed on one hook
                    of the traveller, and the ends from the shaping tubes are cut off and put on the
                    hooks of the fixed machine, called the “ fore-turn.” The carriage containing the
                    “ top ” is now brought close to the traveller, and the strands are placed in the
                    grooves of the top as explained under hand-laying. Similar means to those used
                    in hand-spinning are adopted for keeping the rope off the ground. The two
                    machines are now started, the three hooks of the fore-turn machine revolving in
                    one direction and the single hook of the traveller revolving in the opposite
                    direction. Simultaneously the carriage with the laying top moves forward towards
                    the head of the walk.</p>
                <p>Fig- 9» Plate I., shows many stages in the process of rope-making. The most
                    prominent part shows the carriage with the top in position approaching the
                    fore-turn machine at the head of the walk. The person on the right of the
                    carriage is holding a top in his left hand, while the top in the carriage is
                    laying a rope of four strands. At other parts of the figure appear three or four
                    travellers, some twisting the strands, others moving up the walk as the laying
                    proceeds, while on the extreme right one machine is laying two ropes, of three
                    strands each, at the same time.</p>
                <p>We have already stated that the yarns for the above machine may be prepared by
                    two systems. When the hemp fibte is spun on the ordinary frame, the method of
                    preparation for such a frame is somewhat similar to that employed for flax,, but
                    since the fibre is harsher than flax, it invariably requires softening. The
                    softening machines crush the streaks as m the case of jute, but the fluted
                    rollers are arranged to form part of a circle. The coarser fibres receive a
                    somewhat different treatment; the first process in the preparation of Manila
                    hemp and similar fibres used for rope yarn is illustrated in fig. io, Plate I.
                    The streaks are clearly shown as being led between fluted rollers on to the pins
                    of the hackling and spreading machine; the lanterns or skeleton rollers,, seen
                    on the extreme right, press the fibres into the pins. A little oil is made to
                    drop on t cut he fibre in order to soften it and to facilitate the operation.
                    The oiling apparatus is usually of a simple character, and consists of a
                    revolving roller partly immersed in an oil bath. The roller is driven as shown
                    in the figure, and the oil which it draws up is scraped off its surface by a
                    knife-edge, and led, by means of a sheet, upon the fibre between the fluted
                    rollers and the gill-pins. A view of a similar machine is shown in fig. 11,
                    Plate II., from which it will be seen that there are two sheets of revolving
                    gill-pins. The sheet nearest the feed-cloth revolves slightly quicker than the
                    surface speed of the fluted feed rollers, while the second sheet moves at a much
                    higher rate. The difference in the speeds of the gill-pins results in the fibre
                    being combed out and straightened, while the delivery rollers, the surface speed
                    of which is slightly greater than that of the second sheet of gill-pins, help
                    further to complete the process, and finally deliver the fibre in the form of a
                    broad ribbon, termed a sliver.</p>
                <p>In general, three such machines are used for the process; the pins in the
                    gill-sheets are graded, those in the second machine being finer and more closely
                    set than those in the first machine, while a still finer and closer arrangement
                    obtains in the third machine. The slivers from the third hackling and spreading
                    machine are now placed at the back of the first drawing frame, one type of which
                    appears in fig. 12, Plate II. Each sliver is passed separately over a guide
                    pulley, led upon the pins, drawn out and joined by others, and finally delivered
                    as a sliver ready for the second drawing frame. A similar process is carried on
                    in this machine, from which the sliver emerges ready for the spinning frame. It
                    will thus be seen that a system of doubling, as well as of drawing, obtains in
                    these processes as in flax-preparing; such a system is adopted in order to
                    obtain uniformity of sliver and the correct weight.</p>
                <p>The slivers are taken from the drawing frame to the automatic spinner—a beautiful
                    piece of mechanism. Fig. 13, Plate II., illustrates the machine as it leaves the
                    makers. Two sliver cans from the second drawing frame are placed behind the
                    machine, and the slivers passed between the rollers. They are then deflected and
                    made to enter a trumpet-mouthed conductor which guides them on to the pins of
                    the chain-sheet. As the two slivers emerge from these pins, each enters a
                    separate self-feeding and adjusting apparatus, the function of which is, as its
                    name implies, to regulate the delivery of the sliver to the nippers.. The
                    delivery is increased or decreased according as the sliver is. thin.or thick.
                    Consequently, a very even yarn results; indeed, it is claimed that for
                    uniformity of yarn this system of spinning has no equal. The bobbins, which</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0716" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0767.jp2"/>
                <p>are placed in a horizontal position, have' a lateral movement, so that the
                    finished yarn may be wound on evenly. This machine is made for ordinary rope
                    yarn, and for binder twine for self-reaping machines. When all three spreading
                    machines arc used in conjunction with the spiral drawing frames, the automatic
                    feeding arrangement is sometimes considered unnecessary, because of the
                    uniformity of the slivers when delivered from the finishing drawing</p>
                <p>. frame.</p>
                <p>Whence / = *536 ft., say -54 ft. per lb; that is to say, 1 lb of Manila fibre,
                    approximately 6 in. in length, spread on the feed-table of No. 1 spreading and
                    hackling machine, and subjected to the above drafts and doublings, would produce
                    yarn No. 22" of 330 ft. per lb from the automatic spinner.</p>
                <p>The bobbins from these automatic spinners may be used in the bank at the
                    rope-walk as already indicated, or they may be taken to what is termed a “ house
                    machine.” These machines are of two distinct kinds—vertical and horizontal. They
                    perform the same work as the machines in the rope-walk, but take up much less
                    space.</p>
                <p>’ Figs. 16 and 17, Plate IV., illustrate two types of horizontal machines, each
                    of which is capable of completing a rope in one operation. The process is pretty
                    clear in fig. 17, which shows that eighteen threads are treated at once. On the
                    right, and driven by spur gearing, arc three revolving carriages or creels, each
                    containing six bobbins. Each group revolves as the yarns are drawn off the
                    bobbins, and thus the threads are formed into three strands.’ As the strands
                    emerge from the guides, they converge towards three other guides, are laid
                    together, and finally the finished rope is wound on to the reel.</p>
                <p>In principle the vertical machine is the same as the horizontal machine, and the
                    rope is, consequently, made in one operation. Any number of bobbins, from 24 to
                    128, may be twisted at the same time; the machine in fig. 18, Plate IV., is for
                    making a rope of three strands, each with 12 threads, or 36 threads in all.
                    These machines are also made to make ropes of four strands. The strands are
                    formed by the rotation of the carriages, from the top of which each strand
                    passes. The three strands then converge to, and pass through, the top of the
                    machine, where they are laid into a rope. The latter passes over a series of
                    guide pulleys, and is ultimately wound on the large drum shown In front of the
                    machine. Such a machine for making a 128-thread, four-strand rope, occupies only
                    about 125 sq. ft.—8 ft. 9 in.Xi4 ft. 4 in.</p>
                <p>In addition to the heavy rope there are many varieties of cord and twine made by
                    means of the preparing, spinning and doubling machines. The fishing industry
                    takes many different types for lines and nets, while the variety of cord and
                    twine for other industrial and for household purposes is almost unlimited. All
                    yarn from long vegetable fibre is more or less rough as it leaves the spinning
                    frame, even after two or more threads have been twisted together. It is
                    therefore necessary, for many uses, to impart a polish to the cord or twine.
                    Special machines are used for this purpose. A certain number of bobbins,
                    depending upon the capacity of the machine, are placed in a bank, and the ends
                    are collected and passed under a roller which is immersed in hot starch. The
                    yarns become saturated</p>
                <p>with this starch, but, as they emerge from the starch-box, the superfluous starch
                    is removed by passing the yarns between two rollers. The yarns now pass over a
                    series of drying cylinders and polishing rollers, and are finally rewound by the
                    same machine on bobbins. These machines are termed bobbin-to-bobbin polishing
                    machines. In some cases the hot drying cylinders are replaced by a system of hot
                    air drying. The finished yarns are now made up by machinery into hanks, balls or
                    cheeses, according to which happens to be the best state for future use and for
                    transport.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Driving Ropes.—</hi> It has already been stated that cotton
                    driving ropes are extensively applied in the transmission of motive power.
                    Although the mechanical efficiency of transmission.by ropes is less than that
                    obtained by wheel gearing, rope driving has several compensating
                    advantages:—</p>
                <p>1. It is practically noiseless.</p>
                <p>2. It occupies less space than belt driving, and the slip is not</p>
                <p>so great.</p>
                <p>3. The turning movement is better; machines therefore run more</p>
                <p>steadily and production is increased.</p>
                <p>4. Shafts may be run at higher speeds.</p>
                <p>5. Greater range of drives; anything from IO ft. to over 80 ft.,</p>
                <p>and much greater distances when carrier pulleys are used.</p>
                <p>6. The drive is usually obtained by a number of ropes; if one</p>
                <p>should break, the rope, may be removed and the machinery run, in most cases,
                    until stopping-time.</p>
                <p>The number of ropes to be used depends upon the power to be transmitted and upon
                    the surface speed of the driving pulley. The speed of the rope may vary from
                    2000 ft. to 6000 ft. or over per minute. .In some few exceptional cases 60 ropes
                    have been used on one pulley; the number usually varies between 15 and 40. (See
                    also <hi rend="smallcaps">Power Transmission, §</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">Mechanical.)</hi> Fig. 6 shows the</p>
                <p>application of these ropes, which pass direct from the main driving pulley to the
                    different flats of the mill. Fig. 7 shows the construction of the Lambeth</p>
                <p>four - strand cotton</p>
                <p>rope. There are two</p>
                <p>distinct systems of ar</p>
                <p>ranging . the ropes on</p>
                <p>the driver and the</p>
                <p>driven pulleys. In the</p>
                <p>United Kingdom each</p>
                <p>rope is independent of</p>
                <p>all . the others, and, as</p>
                <p>it is unlikely for more</p>
                <p>than one rope to break at a time, the stoppages are reduced to a minimum. In
                    America, where hemp ropes are largely employed,</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0717" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0770.jp2"/>
                <p>the continuous system is mostly used; here the rope is wound round and round over
                    driver and driven, and, except in rare cases, is joined only at one place.
                    Although the system has the great advantage of the minimum number of joinings,
                    it requires tension pulleys to keep the ropes taut. It is also clear that when
                    the rope breaks at any point the machinery must stand until the repair is
                    completed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wire Ropes.—</hi> Although the manufacture of ropes is of
                    ancient origin, the practice of making ropes from wire on a large scale is of
                    comparatively recent date. Since 1874, however, great developments have taken
                    place in the manufacture of ropes from different kinds of wire, and the uses to
                    which they can be put have enormously increased. This is owing almost entirely
                    to the introduction of flexible wire ropes which were invented about this time
                    by Messrs Bullivant &amp; Co. Ltd., of 72 Mark Lane, London, E.C. Prior to that
                    date the uses at which wire ropes were put were limited to winding ropes for
                    collieries and hauling, and to cases in which flexibility was not a great
                    desideratum. The introduction of flexibility,, however, made possible the use of
                    wire rope for ships’ hawsers and rigging, for cranes, derricks and other
                    purposes for which hempen ropes were formerly employed—indeed it has almost
                    entirely superseded hemp for marine uses. The reason is that it is much stronger
                    for the same size than rope made from any other material, whilst for the same
                    strength its size and weight are only about one-third that, of hempen rope.
                    Consequently, the required power may be obtained with a wire rope of
                    comparatively small bulk.</p>
                <p>Wire rope is specially suited for aerial’ ropeways which provide a means of
                    conveying ore, metals, merchandise, &amp;e., over ground where it would be
                    difficult to arrange transport by ordinary means. Messrs Bullivant &amp; Co.
                    Ltd., to whom we are indebted for the table of strengths and other particulars,
                    as well as for the sectional illustration of wire ropes, construct seven
                    different systems of aerial ropeways:—</p>
                <p>1. The endless running rope, with carriers hanging therefrom</p>
                <p>and moving with it.through frictional contact.</p>
                <p>2. An endless rope, with the carriers hanging therefrom and</p>
                <p>moving with it, being rigidly fixed in position on the rope.</p>
                <p>3. The fixed rope, in which the carriers are drawn along and</p>
                <p>hang from a fixed rope which acts also as a rail, returning on a parallel
                    rope.</p>
                <p>4. The single fixed rope, in which* one carrier, hanging from a</p>
                <p>fixed rope, is drawn to and fro by means of an endless hauling rope.</p>
                <p>5. The use of two fixed ropes with an endless hauling rope, in</p>
                <p>which one carrier travels in one direction, while the other travels on a parallel
                    rope in the opposite direction. This is a serviceable type of ropeway, capable
                    of being used over extremely long spans, and of carrying loads up to 5 tons.</p>
                <p>6. The use of one fixed rope placed on an incline, on which the</p>
                <p>carriers (uncontrolled by hauling ropes) with their suspended loads are allowed
                    to run down at a high speed. This is generally called a “ shoot.”</p>
                <p>7. Bullivant’s system of aerial ropeway for raising, lowering,</p>
                <p>and transporting heavy loads, by means of which a load can be hoisted, traversed
                    in either direction and deposited at one. operation. . •</p>
                <p>The flexibility of a wire rope depends upon the number of wires of which it is
                    formed; consequently the use to. which a rope is to be put will partly determine
                    the number of wires used in its construction. In some cases nearly 400
                    individual wires are employed in making one rope. Fig. 8 shows in section ten
                    different types of construction, the particulars of which appear below:—</p>
                <p>1. Laid rope made of 6 strands of 7 wires each. This is the</p>
                <p>class of rope most frequently used for hauling, ropes where the size of the
                    barrel and sheave will permit; it is also the make of rope in general use for
                    standing rigging, and is such as is required by Lloyd’s regulations.</p>
                <p>2. Hauling rope made of 6 strands, each strand being of 7 wires</p>
                <p>covering 7 smaller ones.</p>
                <p>3. Hauling rope made of 6 strands, each of 8 wires covering</p>
                <p>7 smaller ones.</p>
                <p>4. Hauling rope made of 6 strands, each of 10 wires covering</p>
                <p>7 smaller ones.</p>
                <p>5. Formed rope made of 6. strands of 19 wires each. In larger</p>
                <p>sizes this make of rope is used for standing rigging on vessels. In smaller sizes
                    it is sometimes used for running rigging, and it is the usual make of rope for
                    trawl warps.</p>
                <p>6. Flexible steel wire rope, made of 6 strands each of 12 wires,</p>
                <p>with hemp heart and hemp centre in each strand. This is the usual make of
                    flexible steel wire rope, 4I in. in circumference and smaller; used for hawsers,
                    running lifts, hoists, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>7. Extra flexible steel wire rope made of 6 strands each of</p>
                <p>24 wires.</p>
                <p>8. Special extra flexible steel wire rope made of 6 strands each of</p>
                <p>37 wires.</p>
                <p>9. Special extra flexible steel wire rope made of 6 strands each of</p>
                <p>61 wires. This is the make of rope usually adopted for large ropes—say over io*
                    in. in circumference—which are largely used for slipway and salvage
                    purposes.</p>
                <p>10. Cable-laid rope. This is an obsolete form of rope, which is composed of six
                    complete ropes twisted together.</p>
                <p>The diameter of drums and sheaves should be about thirty times the circumference
                    of the rope.</p>
                <p>For shaft winding at high speed one-tenth of the breaking strain of a rope is
                    sometimes taken as a fair working load. For inclines, the proportion of load to
                    breaking strain varies according to gradient conditions, and friction should be
                    allowed for.</p>
                <p>The first requisite in the manufacture of wire ropes is the selection and
                    blending of the different iron ores. The different processes through which the
                    metal passes, and the hammering and drawing into rods, require great experience,
                    and give to it the peculiar properties that are essential for the finished
                    article. The same remarks apply to the annealing and hardening processes, during
                    which the rods are drawn through dies to the required gauge. The wire is now
                    subjected to special processes of galvanizing in order to make it proof against
                    atmospheric and other influences. Afterwards it is wound on bobbins of suitable
                    size, a definite number of which are mounted on the forks or frames of the
                    stranding machine. These forks are swung or pivoted between disks, which are
                    keyed on a hollow main shaft, through which the wires or other material</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0718" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0771.jp2"/>
                <p>intended for the core pass. This core is of such a size that the aggregate number
                    of wires that are mounted in the machine exactly cover it in a spiral
                    direction.</p>
                <p>All the wires, including the centre core, are passed through their individual
                    hollow spindles, then led to the nose or head of the machine, and finally passed
                    through a stationary compression block to drawoff wheels. The speed of these
                    wheels is regulated in proportion to the speed of the machine by means of
                    suitable gearing. During the revolutions of the machine each bobbin and fork is
                    kept in a vertical position, and floats thus, by means of an eccentric ring
                    behind the back disk. This ring is connected to the spindles of the bobbin forks
                    by means of small cranks, thus preventing any torsional movement that would
                    otherwise be imparted to the individual wires.</p>
                <p>Each bobbin is controlled by a brake which acts as a tensioning device so that
                    equal strain can be applied to each, allowing the wires to unwind uniformly. The
                    finished strands are wound in turn upon large bobbins, and mounted in the flyers
                    or disks.of the rope closing machine. These machines are similar in design to
                    the stranding machine, but are naturally much heavier in construction, and
                    therefore revolve at a proportionate speed. The speed of the machines varies
                    according to the weight of material, the size of the strands and the
                    construction of the finished rope. The modern machine, or the type most
                    generally used, makes about fifty revolutions per.minute, whilst three times
                    this speed is often obtained when spinning the strands.</p>
                <p>The rapid strides made by electricity have furnished another large branch of what
                    may be termed wire rope manufacture. The ropes used for electrical purposes are
                    almost invariably termed cables, and there are many different kinds and sizes of
                    them. The wire must necessarily possess good conducting power, and be
                    comparatively cheap. Up to the present, copper has proved to be the chief
                    material possessing these two important properties in combination ; hence it is
                    the metal <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> for electrical conduction.
                    Aluminium and alloys have been tried with varying degrees of success.</p>
                <p>The conductor itself consists of a strand of soft copper wires, around which the
                    dielectric or non-conducting material is placed. The methods of forming the
                    strands do not differ essentially from those described above. The dielectric is
                    usually paper, spun jute fibre, vulcanized india-rubber or vulcanized bitumen.
                    If the first two dielectrics are used, a lead sheath is necessary to enclose the
                    insulated strand and so exclude moisture; if the cable is likely to get damaged,
                    it is further enclosed by steel tapes or steel wires, and finally covered with,
                    yarn or braid. Vulcanized bitumen is not only a dielectric, but is also
                    absolutely impervious to moisture. Hence in many instances where paper or fibre
                    is employed.as the principal dielectric, a sheath of vulcanized bitumen is used
                    instead of lead to exclude moisture. Cables are also made with a single central
                    stand of copper wires in addition to one or more concentric layers of copper
                    wires, the layers being separated by some dielectric material; or there may be
                    two or more strands, separately insulated, and more or less elaborately clothed
                    with the above-mentioned substances. (T. Wo.)</p>
