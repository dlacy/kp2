<p><span class="font2">in the neighbourhood of Maeſtricht. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">On </span><span class="font2">the 15th </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">September the French attacked the whole Auſtrian&nbsp;poſts in a.k extent of ſive leagues from Liege to Mae*&nbsp;ſtricht. On that and the following day the loſſes were&nbsp;nearly equal. On the 17th the French with 50 pieces&nbsp;of cannon attacked General Kray in his entrenched&nbsp;camp before Maeſtrſcht. M. de Kray was already re-tiring when General Clairfait arrived with a ſtrong </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">re-</span><span class="font2">inforcement, and after a ſevere combat the French&nbsp;were once more compelled to retire. On the 18th&nbsp;the French renewed the attack with tenfold fury upon&nbsp;every part of the Auſtrian line, and the whole was&nbsp;compelled to fly to the neighbourhood of Aix-la-Cha-pelle. General Clairſait now choſe a ſtrong pofition&nbsp;on the banks </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font2"> the Roer, where he even declared it&nbsp;to be his wiſh that he might be attacked. But by this&nbsp;time the ſpirit of his army was humbled, deſertions&nbsp;became numerous, and the want of diſcipline was extreme. On tlie iſt of October the French croſſed the&nbsp;Maeſe and the Roer, and attacked the whole Auſtrian&nbsp;poſts from Ruremond down to Juliers. After a bloody&nbsp;engagement, the brave and active, though unfortunate,&nbsp;General Clairfait was compelled haſtily to croſs the&nbsp;Rhine, with the lofs of 10 or 1 2,000 men. The French&nbsp;general did not attempt to croſs that river, but one detachment of his army took poſſeſſion of Coblentz, while&nbsp;others laid cloſe ſiege to Venlo and Maeſtricht, which&nbsp;ſoon ſurrendered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The diviſion of the French army, in the mean time, under General Pichegru came down upon Holland,&nbsp;and attacked the allied army under the duke of York&nbsp;between Bois-leduc and Grave. They forced the advanced poſt of Boxtel. Lieutenant-general Abercromby&nbsp;was ſent to attempt to recover this poſt on the 15th&nbsp;of September, but he found the French in ſuch force&nbsp;that he was obliged to retreat. Indeed tlie French&nbsp;were difcovered to </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font2">no lefs than 80,000 ſtrong in that&nbsp;neighbourhood. The duke of York was unable to&nbsp;contend againſt a for-ce ſo ſuperior, and retired acroſs the&nbsp;Maeſe with the loſs of fomewhat leſs than 1500 men.&nbsp;Pichegru immediately laid ſiege to Bois-le-duc. On the&nbsp;30th of September, Crevecœur was taken, and bois-leduc ſurrendered in 10 days thereafter. In it 408 French&nbsp;emigrants were taken griſoners ; and theſe, as well as 700&nbsp;that had been taken at Nieuportf 500 at Sluys, and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ι </span><span class="font2">ico at Valenciennes, were all put to death, agreeably tt&gt;&nbsp;the rigorous law formerly made by the convention. The&nbsp;French now followed the duke of York acroſs the&nbsp;Maeſe. Lſpon this the greater part of the allied army&nbsp;under his royal highneſs croſſed the Rhine and took poſt&nbsp;at Arnheim. The remaining part of the army ſol-lewed ſoon after, and Nimeguen was occupied by the&nbsp;French on the 7th of November. The duke of Brunfwick was at this time requeſted to take the command&nbsp;of the allied army, to protect Holland, if poffible. He&nbsp;came to Arnheim forthat purpofe; but after examining&nbsp;the ſtate of things there, he declined the undertaking.&nbsp;The allied troops had now ſo often fled before their&nbsp;victorious and almoſt innumerable enemies, they had&nbsp;ſo often been in want of every neceſſary, and had&nbsp;been received ſo ill by the inhabitants of the countries&nbsp;through which they paſſed, among whom the French&nbsp;cauſe was extremely popular, that they had loſt that&nbsp;regularity of conduct and diſcipline which alone can&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">afford a ſecure proſpect ef Iucceſa in military affaira.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The French, on the </span><span class="font2">contrary, well received, nbmſhdlng in every thing, and proud of fighting in a popular cauſe,&nbsp;now acted with much order, and ſubmitted to the ſtricteſt&nbsp;diſeipline. ln addition to all tlieſe advantages, the French&nbsp;leaders had the dexterity to pejſuade the world that&nbsp;new and unknown arts were employed to give aid to&nbsp;their cauſe. At this period the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">télégraphe</span><span class="font2"> was ſirſt&nbsp;uſed ſor conveying intelligence from the frontiers to&nbsp;the capital, and from tlie capital to the frontiers. (See&nbsp;Télégraphe). Balloons were alſo uſed by the French&nbsp;during this campaign to procure knowledge of the po-ſition of the enemy. A11 engineer afcended with the&nbsp;balloon, which was ſuffered to riſe to a great height,&nbsp;but prevented from flying away by a long cord. He&nbsp;made plans of the enemies encampment ; and during&nbsp;an attack he ſent down notice of every hoſtile move-ment. In the affairs of men, and more eſpecially in&nbsp;military tranfactions, opinion is of more importance&nbsp;than reality. The French ſoldiers confided in their&nbsp;own officers as men poſſeſſed of a kind of omniſeience,&nbsp;while the allied troops, no doubt, beheld with anxiety a&nbsp;new contrivance employed againſt them, whoſe import-ance would be readily magnified by credulity and ignorance. with all theſe advantages, however, after the&nbsp;capture of Nimeguen, they once more made a halt in&nbsp;their carrier, and abſtained from the attack of Holland,&nbsp;which now ſeemed almoſt proſtrate before them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">while theſe events occurred in the north, the French arms were fcarcely leſs ſucceſsful on the ſide ef Spain.&nbsp;Bellegarde was taken ; in the weſtern Pyrenees, Fon-tarabia ſurrendered, and alſo St Sebaſtian ; the whole&nbsp;kingdom of Spain ſeemed panic ſtruck. That feeble&nbsp;government, with an almoſt impregnable frontier, and&nbsp;the moſt powerful fortreſſes, could make little reſiſtance ;&nbsp;and the difficult nature of their country was their only&nbsp;protection. The hiſtory of this war is only a hiſtory&nbsp;of victories on the part of the French. In the Eaſtern&nbsp;Pyrenees, on the 17th of November, the French </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">general</span><span class="font2"> Dugommier was killed in an engagement, in which&nbsp;his army was ſucceſsful. On the 20th of that month&nbsp;the French again attacked the Spaniards, and routed&nbsp;them by meansof the bayonet, without firing a ſingle&nbsp;muſket-ſhot. Tents, baggage, and cannon, for an ar-my of 50,000 men, fell into the hand of the conquerors,&nbsp;along with a great part of the province of Navarre.&nbsp;Towards the end of the year, an army of 40,000 Spa-niards, entrenched behind 80 redoubts, the labour of ſix&nbsp;monthe, ſuffered themſelves to be completely routed ;&nbsp;their general count de La Union was found dead on&nbsp;the field of battle, and the whole Spaniſh artillery was&nbsp;taken. In three days thereafter, the ſort Fernando&nbsp;de Figuieres, containing a garriſon of 9107 men, ſurrendered, although it mounted 171 pieces of cannon,&nbsp;and poſſeſſed abundance of proviſions. The French&nbsp;continued their conqueſts ; Rofas was taken, and the&nbsp;whole province of Catalonia was left at the mercy of&nbsp;the invaders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſuccefſes of this wonderful campaign were not yet terminated ; and the laſt part of them is perhaps the&nbsp;moſt important, although no great effort was neceffary&nbsp;to its execution. The winter now ſet in with uncom-mon ſeverity. For ſome years paſt the ſeaſons of Eu«&nbsp;rope had been uncommonly mild ; there had been lit-tle froſt in winter, and no intenfe heat in ſummer.
