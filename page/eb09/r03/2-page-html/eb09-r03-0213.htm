<p><span class="font1">Orageuse (1857), the Coucher de Soleil (1866), and one of his last works, the Soleil par un Temps Orageux,&nbsp;which appeared in the exhibition of 1867. Rousseau’s&nbsp;study of Constable is more especially apparent in some of&nbsp;his fine forest scenes near Fontainebleau, and in some&nbsp;magnificently painted views on the banks of the Loire and&nbsp;other French rivers. His execution was of extraordinary&nbsp;brilliance, and he was a thorough master of atmospheric&nbsp;effect and glowing sunset colours. Though in some respects a realistic painter, he treated nature in a strongly&nbsp;dramatic way and showed great imaginative power. His&nbsp;style is broad and dashing, with rapid and at times apparently careless handling. His fame has increased rather&nbsp;than diminished since his death in 1867 ; and one of his&nbsp;paintings has recently received the high distinction of being&nbsp;transferred from the Luxembourg Palace to the Louvre, an&nbsp;honour which is but rarely conferred. It is not, however,&nbsp;one of the best specimens of his work. Most of Théodore&nbsp;Rousseau’s pictures are in private collections in Paris and&nbsp;elsewhere in France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROUSSILLON, a province of France, which now forms the greater part of the department of </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pyrénées&nbsp;Orientales (ç.v.).</span><span class="font1"> It was bounded on the south by the&nbsp;Pyrenees, on the west by the county of Foix, on the north&nbsp;by Languedoc, and on the east by the Mediterranean. The&nbsp;province derived its name from a small bourg near&nbsp;Perpignan, the capital, called Ruscino (Rosceliona, Castel&nbsp;Rossello), where the Gallic chieftains met to consider&nbsp;Hannibal’s request for a conference. The district formed&nbsp;part of the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis from&nbsp;121 B.c. to 462 </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.,</span><span class="font1"> when it was ceded with the rest of&nbsp;Septimania to Theodoric II., king of the Visigoths. His&nbsp;successor, Amalaric, on his defeat by Clovis in 531 retired&nbsp;to Spain, leaving a governor in Septimania. In 719 the&nbsp;Saracens crossed the Pyrenees, and Septimania was held&nbsp;by them until their defeat by Pippin in 756. On the&nbsp;invasion of Spain by Charlemagne in 778 he found the&nbsp;borderlands wasted by the Saracenic wars, and the inhabitants hiding among the mountains. He accordingly made&nbsp;grants of land to Visigothic refugees from Spain, and&nbsp;founded several monasteries, round which the people&nbsp;gathered for protection. In 792 the Saracens again&nbsp;invaded France, but were repulsed by Louis, king of&nbsp;Aquitaine, whose rule extended over all Catalonia as far&nbsp;as Barcelona. The different portions of his kingdom in&nbsp;time grew into allodial fiefs, and in 893 Suniaire II.&nbsp;became the first hereditary count of Roussillon. But his&nbsp;rule only extended over the eastern part of what became&nbsp;the later province. The western part, or Cerdagne, was&nbsp;ruled in 900 by Miron as first count, and one of his&nbsp;grandsons, Bernard, was the first hereditary count of the&nbsp;middle portion, or Bésalu. In Illl Raymond-Bérenger&nbsp;III., count of Barcelona, inherited the fief of Bésalu, to&nbsp;which was added in 1117 that of Cerdagne; and in 1172&nbsp;his grandson, Alphonso II., king of Aragon, united Roussillon to his other states on the death of the last count,&nbsp;Gerard IL The counts of Roussillon, Cerdagne, and&nbsp;Bésalu were not sufficiently powerful to indulge in any&nbsp;wars of ambition. Their energies had been accordingly&nbsp;devoted to furthering the welfare of their people, who&nbsp;enjoyed both peace and prosperity under their rule.&nbsp;Under the Aragonese monarchs the progress of the united&nbsp;province still continued, and Collioure, the port of&nbsp;Perpignan, became a centre of Mediterranean trade. But&nbsp;the country was in time destined to pay the penalty of its&nbsp;position on the frontiers of France and Spain in the long&nbsp;struggle for ascendency between these two powers. James&nbsp;I. of Aragon had wrested the Balearic Isles from the&nbsp;Moors and left them with Roussillon to his son James&nbsp;(1276), with the title of king of Majorca. The consequent&nbsp;disputes of this monarch with his brother Pedro III. of&nbsp;Aragon were not lost sight of by Philip III. of France in&nbsp;his quarrel with the latter about the crown of the Two&nbsp;Sicilies. Philip espoused James’s cause and led his army&nbsp;into Spain, but retreating died at Perpignan in 1285.&nbsp;James then became reconciled to his brother, and in 1311&nbsp;was succeeded by his son Sancho, who founded the&nbsp;cathedral of Perpignan shortly before his death in 1324.&nbsp;His successor James II. refused to do homage to Philip&nbsp;VI. of France for the Seignioryof Montpellier, and applied&nbsp;to Pedro IV. of Aragon for aid. Pedro not only refused&nbsp;it, but on various pretexts declared war against him, and&nbsp;seized Majorca and Roussillon in 1344. The province was&nbsp;now again united to Aragon, and enjoyed peace until&nbsp;1462. In this year the disputes between John II. and&nbsp;his son about the crown of Navarre gave Louis XI. of&nbsp;France an excuse to support John against his subjects,&nbsp;who had risen in revolt. Louis at the fitting time turned&nbsp;traitor, and the province having been pawned to him for&nbsp;300,000 crowns was Occupied by the French troops until&nbsp;1493, when Charles VIIL restored it to Ferdinand and&nbsp;Isabella. During the war between France and Spain&nbsp;(1496-98) the people suffered equally from the Spanish&nbsp;garrisons and the French invaders. But dislike of the&nbsp;Spaniards was soon effaced in the pride of sharing in the&nbsp;glory of Charles V., and in 1542, when Perpignan was&nbsp;besieged by the dauphin, the Roussillonnais remained true&nbsp;to their allegiance. Afterwards the decay of Spain was&nbsp;France’s opportunity, and, on the revolt of the Catalans&nbsp;against the Castilians in 1641, Louis XIII. espoused the&nbsp;cause of the former, and by the treaty of 1659 secured&nbsp;Roussillon to the French crown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROVEREDO (in German sometimes </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rofreit),</span><span class="font1"> one of the chief industrial cities in South Tyrol, and, after Trent,&nbsp;the chief seat of the Tyrolese silk industry, is situated on&nbsp;the left bank of the Adige (Etsch), in the fertile Val&nbsp;Lagarina, 35 miles north of Verona and IOO miles south&nbsp;of Innsbruck. Though there are several open places&nbsp;within the town, the streets, except in the newer quarters,&nbsp;are narrow, crooked, and uneven. Of the two parish&nbsp;churches, S. Marco dates from the 15th century and&nbsp;Sta Maria del Carmine from 1678. The only other&nbsp;interesting building is the quaint old castle known as&nbsp;Castell Junk. As an active trading town and administrative centre Roveredo is well equipped with commercial,&nbsp;judicial, educational, and benevolent institutions. Though&nbsp;the district between Trent and Verona yields about&nbsp;120,000 lb of silk annually, the silk industry of Roveredo,&nbsp;introduced in the 16th century, has declined during the&nbsp;last fifty years. The establishments id which the cocoons&nbsp;are unwound </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Jilande)</span><span class="font1"> are distinct from those in which&nbsp;the silk is spun </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Jilatoje).</span><span class="font1"> The silk is not woven at&nbsp;Roveredo. Paper and leather are the other chief manufactures of the place ; and a brisk trade in southern fruits&nbsp;and red wine is carried on. The population is 8864.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The origin of Roveredo is probably to be traced to the founding of the castle by William of Castelbarco-Lizzauaabout 1300. Later&nbsp;it passed to the emperor Frederick of the Empty Pockets, who&nbsp;sold it to Venice in 1413. The treaty of Cambray transferred it&nbsp;from Venice to the emperor Maximilian in 1510, since which time&nbsp;it has shared the fate of southern Tyrol, finally passing to&nbsp;Austria in 1814. In September 1709 the French under Massena&nbsp;won a victory over the Austrians near Roveredo. Near the&nbsp;neighbouring village of St Marco are the traces of a destructive&nbsp;landslip in 883, described in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Inferno</span><span class="font0"> (xii. 4-9) by Dante, who&nbsp;spent part of his exile in 1302 in a castle near Lizzana.</span></p>
