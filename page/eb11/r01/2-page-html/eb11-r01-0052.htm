<p><span class="font1">RAGUSA (Serbo-Croatian </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dubrovnik),</span><span class="font1"> an episcopal city, and the centre of an administrative district in Dalmatia, Austria.&nbsp;Pop. (1900) of town and commune, 13, 174, inchiding a garrison&nbsp;of 1122. Its situation and its undisturbed atmosphere of&nbsp;antiquity combine to make Ragusa by far the most picturesque&nbsp;city on the Dalmatian coast. It occupies a ridge or promontory,&nbsp;which juts out into the Adriatic Sea, under the bare limestone&nbsp;mass of Monte Sergio. Its seaward fortifications rise directly&nbsp;from the water’s edge, one fort, on the north mole, standing&nbsp;boldly on a tall rock almost isolated by a little inlet of the&nbsp;Adriatic. On the landward side a massive round tower dominates the city from a still higher eminence. Beyond the walls&nbsp;and the deep moat, especially on the northward side towards&nbsp;the port of Gravosa, are many pleasant villas, surrounded by&nbsp;gardens in which the aloe, palm and cypress are conspicuous&nbsp;among a number of flowering trees and shrubs. The island of&nbsp;Lacroma lies less than half a mile to the south. Between the&nbsp;seaward ridge and the mountain, the Stradone, or main street,&nbsp;runs along a narrow valley which, until the 13th century,&nbsp;was a marshy channel, dividing the Latin island of Ragusa&nbsp;from the Slavonic settlement of Dubrovnik, on the lower slopes&nbsp;of Monte Sergio. Parallel to the Stradone, on the north, is the&nbsp;Prijeki, a long, very narrow street, flanked by tall houses with&nbsp;overhanging balconies, and greatly resembling a Venetian&nbsp;alley. Despite the havoc wrought by earthquake in 1667, the&nbsp;whole city is rich in antiquarian interest. It possesses one&nbsp;church, of the Byzantine period, which is mentioned in 13th-century documents as even then of great age. Two stately&nbsp;convents of the 14th century stand at the ends of the city;&nbsp;for the Franciscans were set to guard the western gate, or Porta&nbsp;Pile, against the hostile Slavs, while the Dominicans kept the&nbsp;eastern gate, or Porta Ploce. The Franciscan cloister is a fine&nbsp;specimen of late Romanesque; that of the Dominicans is&nbsp;hardly inferior, though of later date. The Dominican church&nbsp;is approached by a sloping flagged lane, having on one&nbsp;side a beautifully ornamented balustrade of the 18th century.&nbsp;Another 14th-century building is the Sponza, or custom-house,&nbsp;from which the state derived its principal revenue. A fountain&nbsp;and a curious clock-tower in the Piazza, which terminates the&nbsp;Stradone towards the east, were erected by Onofrio, the architect and engineer whose aqueduct, built about 1440, supplied&nbsp;Ragusa with water from the neighbouring hills. The Rector's&nbsp;PaIace, another noteworthy example of late Romanesque,&nbsp;combined with Venetian Gothic, is one of the masterpieces of&nbsp;Dalmatian architecture. It has a fine façade of six arches,&nbsp;and the capitals of the supporting pillars are very curiously&nbsp;carved. Especially interesting is the figure of Aesculapius,&nbsp;whose traditional birthplace was </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Epidaurum</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Epidaurus, </span><span class="font1">the parent city of Ragusa. The cathedral dates from the&nbsp;18th century; and to the same period belongs another church,&nbsp;rebuilt after a fire, but originally erected as a votive offering&nbsp;after the pestilence of 1348, and dedicated to San Biagio (St&nbsp;Blaize), the patron of Ragusa, whose name and effigy con-tinually appear on coins and buildings. Among many fine pieces&nbsp;of jewellers’ work preserved in the ecclesiastical treasuries may&nbsp;be mentioned the silver statuette of San Biagio, and the reliquary which contains his skull—a 17th-century casket in filigree&nbsp;and enamels with Byzantine medallions of the 11th or 12th&nbsp;century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The harbour of Ragusa, once one of the chief ports of southern Europe, is too small for modern needs; but Gravosa&nbsp;(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gruž</span><span class="font1">)</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font1"> a village at the mouth of the river Ombla, on the&nbsp;north, is a steamship station and communicates by rail with&nbsp;Herzegovina and the Bocche di Cattaro. Ragusa has thus&nbsp;some transit trade with the interior. Its industries include the&nbsp;manufacture of liqueurs, oil, silk and leather; but Malmsey,&nbsp;its famous wine, could no longer be produced after the vine-disease of 1852.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History. —</span><span class="font1">The name </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ragusa</span><span class="font1"> is of uncertain origin. Constantine Porphyrogenitus, in the 10th century, connects its early form, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lausa,</span><span class="font1"> with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">λαύ</span><span class="font1">, a “ precipice. ” Jireček dissents&nbsp;from this view, and from the common opinion that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dubrovnik&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">is derived from the Slavonic </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dubrava,</span><span class="font1"> “ woody. ” The city&nbsp;first became prominent during the 7th century. In 639&nbsp;and 656 the flourishing Latin communities of. Salona and&nbsp;Epidaurum were destroyed by the Avars, and the island rock&nbsp;of Ragusa was colonized by the survivors. Tradition identifies&nbsp;Epidaurum, whence the majority came, with the neighbouring&nbsp;village of Ragusavecchia; but some historians, including Gelcich,&nbsp;place it on the shores of the Bocche di Cattaro. Both sites&nbsp;show signs of Roman occupation. A colony of Slavs soon&nbsp;joined the Latin settlers at Ragusa, and thus, from an early&nbsp;date, the city formed a link between two great civilizations&nbsp;(see Vlachs). In the 9th century it is said to have repulsed&nbsp;the Saracens; in the 10th it defended itself against the Narentine pirates, and Simeon, tsar of the Bulgarians. Some writers&nbsp;consider that it submitted to Venice in 998, with the rest of&nbsp;Dalmatia; but this is generally denied by the native historians.&nbsp;During the 11th century an enforced alliance with the Normans&nbsp;drew the republic into war with Venice and Byzantium; and&nbsp;in the 12th century it was attacked by the Bosnians and Serbs.&nbsp;From 1205 to 1358 it acknowledged Venetian suzerainty; its&nbsp;chief magistrate was the Venetian count; and its archbishops,&nbsp;who wielded much political influence, were often Venetian&nbsp;nominees. The constitution took shape during this period,&nbsp;and the first statute-book was published in 1272. Only&nbsp;patricians could hold office in the senate, grand council and&nbsp;lesser council, three bodies which shared the work of government with the count, or, after 1358, the rector. The ancient&nbsp;popular assembly was almost obsolete before the 14th century.&nbsp;Ragusan policy was usually peaceful, and disputes with other&nbsp;nations were frequently arranged by a system of arbitration&nbsp;called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stanicum.</span><span class="font1"> To refugees of all nations, even to those who&nbsp;had been its own bitter foes, the city afforded asylum; and&nbsp;by means of treaty and tribute it worked its way to a position&nbsp;of mercantile power which Europe could hardly parallel. It&nbsp;was conveniently situated at the seaward end of a great trade&nbsp;route, which bifurcated at Plevlje to Byzantium and the&nbsp;Danube. A compact with the Turks, made in 1370 and renewed&nbsp;in the next century, saved Ragusa from the fate of its more&nbsp;powerful neighbours, Servia and Byzantium, besides enabling&nbsp;the Ragusan caravans to penetrate into Hungary, Croatia,&nbsp;Bosnia, Servia, Bulgaria and Rumania. From 1358 to 1526&nbsp;the republic was a vassaI state of Hungary, and no longer&nbsp;controlled by its greatest commercial rival. It acquired,&nbsp;among other territories, the important ship-building and salt-producing centre Stagno Grande (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ston Veliki),</span><span class="font1"> on the promon-tory of Sabbioncello; and from 1413 to 1416 it held the islands&nbsp;of Curzola, Brazza and Lesina by lease from Hungary. Mean-while, Ragusan vessels were known not only in Italy, Sicily,&nbsp;Spain, Greece, the Levant and Egypt, but in the more northern&nbsp;parts of Europe. The English language retains in the word&nbsp;“ argosy ” a reminiscence of the carracks of Ragusa, long&nbsp;known to Englishmen as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Argouse, Argusa</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aragosa.</span><span class="font1"> In the&nbsp;16th century the Ragusan merchants went even to India and&nbsp;America, but they were unable to compete with their rivals&nbsp;from western Europe. Many of their seamen took service&nbsp;with Spain; and twelve of their finest ships were lost with the&nbsp;Invincible Armada in 1588. After 1526 the downfall of Hungary left Ragusa free; and about this time a great development of art and literature, begun in the 15th century and continued into the 17th, earned for the city its title of the “ South&nbsp;Slavonic Athens. ” (See Servia, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Literature, )</span><span class="font1"> The earthquake&nbsp;of 1667, which had been preceded by lesser shocks in 1520,&nbsp;1521, 1536 and 1639, destroyed a considerable portion of the&nbsp;city, and killed about one-fifth of the inhabitants. Only&nbsp;during the Napoleonic wars did the republic regain its pros-perity. From 1800 to 1805 it was the sole Mediterranean state&nbsp;remaining neutral, and thus it secured a very large share of&nbsp;the carrying trade. In 1805, however, it was seized by the&nbsp;French; Napoleon deprived it of independence; and in 1814&nbsp;it was annexed to Austria.</span></p>
