<p><span class="font0">remarkable freedom from disturbances, either in the form of moun-rain folding or of igneous intrusions. Over the greater part of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">country the strata are still nearly as flat as when they were first laid down, and the deposits, even of the Cambrian period, are as&nbsp;soft as those of the Mesozoic and Tertiary formations in England.&nbsp;Only in the Urals, the Caucasus, the Timan Mountains, the region&nbsp;of the Donets coalfield, and the Kielce Hills is there any sign of the&nbsp;great folding from which nearly the whole of the rest of Europe has&nbsp;suffered at one time or another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the early part of the Palaeozoic era only the gneissic region of Finland and Olonets and probably the Archean mass of S. Russia&nbsp;remained constantly above the sea; but there were several oscillations. Gradually, however, the sea retreated from W. Russia and&nbsp;in the Upper Carboniferous and Permian periods it was confined to&nbsp;the E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At the beginning of the Mesozoic era the whole country became land, bearing upon its surface the salt lakes in which the Trias was&nbsp;laid down. During the Jurassic period the sea again invaded the&nbsp;region, both from the N. and from the S., but still the W. of Russia&nbsp;rose above the waves. In the Cretaceous period the waters withdrew from the N.E., but in the S. they spread W., covering the&nbsp;whole of Poland and finally uniting with the ocean in which the&nbsp;chalk of W. Europe was deposited. The Tertiary era was marked&nbsp;by a gradual extension S. of the N. land-mass. In the later stages&nbsp;arms of the sea were cut off and were converted at,first into lagoons&nbsp;and then into brackish or fresh-water lakes which continued to&nbsp;occupy much of S. Russia until the beginning of the Quaternary&nbsp;period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the first part of the Glacial period Russia seems to have been covered by an immense ice-sheet, which extended also over&nbsp;central Germany, and of which the E. limits cannot yet be determined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Archean rocks have a broad extension in Finland, N. Russia, the Ural Mountains, and <sup>r</sup>the Caucasus., In S. Russia&nbsp;they form the floor upon which lies a thin covering of Tertiary&nbsp;beefs, and they are exposed to view in the valleys of the Dnieper&nbsp;and, the Bug. They consist for the most part of red and grey&nbsp;gneisses and granufites, with subordinate layers of granite and&nbsp;granitite. The Finland </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rappa-kivi,</span><span class="font0"> the Serdobol gneiss, and the&nbsp;Pargas and Rustíala marble (with the so-called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eozoon canadense)&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">yield good building stone; while iron, copper and zinc-ore are&nbsp;common in Finland and in the Urals. Rocks regarded as representing the Huronian system appear also in Finland, in N.W.&nbsp;Russia, as a narrow strip on the Urals, and in the Dnieper ridge.&nbsp;They consist of a series of unfossiliferous crystalline slates.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">The Cambrian is represented by blue clays, ungulite sandstones and bituminous slates in Esthonia and St Petersburg. The Ordovician and Silurian systems are widely developed, and it is most&nbsp;probable that, with the exception of the Archean continents of&nbsp;Finland and the S , the sea covered the whole of Russia. Being&nbsp;concealed, however, by more recent deposits, the deposits appear&nbsp;on the surface only in N.W. Russia (Esthonia, Livonia, St Petersburg and on the Volkhov),‘where all the subdivisions of the system&nbsp;have been found; in the Timan ridge; on the W. slope of the&nbsp;Urals; in the Pai-kho ridge; and in the islands of tne Arctic&nbsp;Ocean. In Poland the rocks of these periods are met with in&nbsp;the Kielce Mountains, and in Podolia in the deeper ravines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Devonian dolomites, limestones and red sandstones cover immense tracts and appear on the surface over a much wider area.&nbsp;From Esthonia these, rocks extend N.E. to Lake Onega, and S.E.&nbsp;to Mogilev; they form ‘.the central plateau, as also the slopes&nbsp;of the Urals and the Petchora region. In N.W. and middle Russia&nbsp;they contain a special fauna, and it appears that the Lower Devonian&nbsp;series of, W. Europe, represented in Poland and in the Urals, is&nbsp;missing in N.W. and central Russia, where only the Middle and&nbsp;Upper Devonian divisions are found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Carboniferous deposits occur over nearly* the whole of E. Russia, their W. boundary being a line drawn from Archangel to the upper&nbsp;Dnieper, thence to, the upper Don, and S. to the mouth of the&nbsp;last-named river, with a long narrow gulf extending W. to encircle&nbsp;the plateau of the Donets. They are visible, however, only on&nbsp;the W. borders of this region, being covered towards the E. by&nbsp;thick Permian and Triassic strata. Russia has three large coal-bearing regions—the, Moscow basin, the Donets region and the&nbsp;Urals. In the Valdai plateau there are only a few beds of mediocre&nbsp;coal. In the Moscow basin, which was a broad gulf of the Carboniferous sea, coal appears as isolated inconstant seams amidst littoral&nbsp;deposits, the formation of which was favoured by frequent minor&nbsp;subsidences, of the seacoast. The coal is here confined to the&nbsp;lower, division of the system; the Upper Carboniferous (corresponding with the English Coal-Measures) is exclusively marine,&nbsp;consisting chiefly of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fusulina</span><span class="font0"> limestone. The Donets Coal-Measures,&nbsp;containing abundant remains of a rich land-flora, cover nearly&nbsp;16,000 sq. m., and comprise a valuable stock of excellent anthracite&nbsp;and coal, together with iron-mines. In this basin, as in W. Europe&nbsp;generally, the principal coal seams occur , in the Upper Carboniferous, while the Lower Carboniferous is mainly composed of&nbsp;marine deposits, with, however, the first bed of coal near its summit.&nbsp;Several smaller coalfields on the slopes of the Urals and on the&nbsp;Timan ridge may be added to the above. The Polish coalfields&nbsp;belong to another Carboniferous area of deposit, which extended&nbsp;over Silesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Permian limestones and marls occupy a strip in E. Russia of much less extent than that assigned to them by Murchison.&nbsp;The variegated marls of E. Russia, rich in salt-springs,, but very&nbsp;poor in fossils, are now held by most Russian geologists to be&nbsp;Triassic. The Permian deposits contain marine shells and also&nbsp;remains of plants similar to those of England and Germany. But&nbsp;in the government of Vologda, on the rivers Sukhona and N.&nbsp;Dvina, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Glossopteris, Noeggerathiopsis</span><span class="font0"> and other ferns characteristic&nbsp;of the Indian Gondwana beds have been found; and with these&nbsp;are numerous remains of reptiles similar to those, which occur in&nbsp;the Indian deposits. In the Urals the marine facies is more fully&nbsp;developed and the fauna shows affinities with that of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pro-ductus</span><span class="font0"> limestone of the Central Asian mountain belt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the Jurassic period the sea began again to invade Russia from S.E. and N.W. The limits of the Russian Jurassic system&nbsp;may be represented by a line drawn from the double valley of&nbsp;the Sukhona and Vytchegda to that of the upper Volga, and thence&nbsp;toKieff, with a wide gulf penetrating towards the NAV. Within&nbsp;this space three depressions, all, running SAV. to N.E., are filled&nbsp;up with Upper Jurassic deposits. They are much denuded in&nbsp;the higher parts of this region, and appear but as isolated islands&nbsp;in central Russia. In the S.E. all the older subdivisions are represented, the deposits having the characters of a deep-sea formation&nbsp;in the Aral-Caspian region and on the Caucasus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Cretaceous beds—sands, loose sandstones, marls and white chalk—occupy nearly the whole of the region S. of a line drawn&nbsp;from the Niemcn to the upper Oka, and Don, and thence N.E. to&nbsp;Simbirsk. Over a large part of this, area, however, they are concealed by the later Tertiary, deposits, and they are absent over&nbsp;the Dnieper and Don ridge in the Yaila Mountains and in the&nbsp;higher parts of the Caucasus. They are rich in grinding stone,&nbsp;and in phosphatic deposits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Tertiary formations occupy large areas in S. Russia. The Eocene covers wide tracts from Lithuania to Tsaritsyn, and is&nbsp;represented in the Crimea and Caucasus by thick deposits belonging to the same ocean which left its deposits on the Alps and the&nbsp;Himalayas. Oligoccne, quite similar to that of N. Germany, and&nbsp;containing brown coal and amber, has been met w*ith only in&nbsp;Poland, Courland and Lithuania. The Miocene, (Sarmatian stage)&nbsp;occupies extensive tracts in S. Russia, S. of a line drawn through&nbsp;Lublin to Ekaterinoslav and Saratov. Not only the higher chains&nbsp;of Caucasus and Yaila, but also the Donets ridge, rose above the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
