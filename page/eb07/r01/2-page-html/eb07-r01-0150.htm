<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">serpens, Anguis quadrupes,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c. which certain species bore) ; their legs are extremely small, and the two pairs placed at&nbsp;a great distance from each other. (See Plate CCCCXXXII.&nbsp;fig. 4.) The lungs in this genus begin to exhibit an inequality of size. Indeed, we may here observe, that in the&nbsp;few remaining groups of Saurian reptiles with which we are&nbsp;still to be engaged, there is a manifest approximation to the&nbsp;true serpents or ophidian race, in the diminution of the feet,&nbsp;the entire disappearance, in certain species, of either the&nbsp;anterior or posterior pair, and the elongated form of the&nbsp;body. Indeed, on the one hand, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lacerta apoda</span><span class="font0"> of Pallas&nbsp;is actually now classed with the Ophidians (being placed at&nbsp;their head), although on each side of the anus there is a prominence containing a small bone analogous to the femur,&nbsp;and pertaining to a true pelvis concealed beneath the skin ;&nbsp;while on the other, certain systematic writers range our&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anguis fragilis,</span><span class="font0"> and other snakes usually so called, among&nbsp;the Saurian reptiles. But to return to our remaining genera,&nbsp;which may really be said to hold their legs and feet by a precarious tenure,so subjectare they to variation—the five-toed&nbsp;seps («S. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pentadactylus, Lac. serpens,</span><span class="font0"> Linn.) inhabits tile&nbsp;East Indies, while a four-toed species </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(S. Mradactylus),</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;a third with only three toes </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(S. tridactylus),</span><span class="font0"> both being viviparous, occur in the Isle de Crès. Another three-toed&nbsp;species («S. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">chaleides)</span><span class="font0"> is native to the south of Europe, and&nbsp;is named </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cecella</span><span class="font0"> by the Italians. It dwells in meadows,&nbsp;feeding on spiders, slugs, &amp;c. and runs rapidly by means of&nbsp;a snake-like wriggling motion, without using its feet. It is&nbsp;also viviparous. A more peculiar kind, known under the&nbsp;name of serpent-lizard («S, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">moηodαctylus, Lac. anguinα,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Linn.), occurs at the Cape of Good Hope. Its legs are&nbsp;nothing more than small footless undivided appendages.&nbsp;This is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vermis Serpentiformis ex Africa</span><span class="font0"> of Seba, said by&nbsp;some authors to be found “ in great plenty in the water and&nbsp;about the rocks in Table Bay.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The genus Bipes, Lacep., makes a still nearer approach to the serpents, as its name indicates. It scarcely differs&nbsp;from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Seps,</span><span class="font0"> except in the entire absence of the fore-legs.&nbsp;It forms as it were the stepping-stone to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anguis.</span><span class="font0"> (See&nbsp;Plate CCCCXXXII. fig. 5.) A species from New Holland&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(B. Iepidopoda,</span><span class="font0"> Lacep.), examined by Baron Cuvier, although its hinder extremities showed themselves externally&nbsp;only under the form of a pair of small oblong scaly plates, was&nbsp;yet found on dissection to possess a femur, tibia, peroneum,&nbsp;and four metatarsal bones without phalanges. To this&nbsp;genus likewise belongs an African species, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anguis bipes,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Linn., and another of larger size from Brazil, described&nbsp;by Spix under the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pygopus Cariocoeca.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The genus called Ciialcides by Daudin is likewise characterized by a long and serpent-like body, but there&nbsp;are four legs (as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Seps),</span><span class="font0"> and the scales, instead of overlapping like tiles, are rectangular, and form transverse&nbsp;bands, which do not encroach upon each other. See Plate&nbsp;CCCCXXXIL fig. 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Certain species have a groove on each side of the body, and the tympanum still very obvious. Of these, an East&nbsp;Indian kind( </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chol. seps, Lac. seps,</span><span class="font0"> Linn.) has five toes, while&nbsp;another ( </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chul. tehadactylus)</span><span class="font0"> has only four. Others have the&nbsp;tympanum concealed, and conduct directly to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chirotes,</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;through it to the ophidian genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Amphisbwna.</span><span class="font0"> Examples,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chαl. Pentadactylus,</span><span class="font0"> which, as its name implies, is a fivetoed species, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chab Iwtcrodactylus l∕lei. imbricatus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Spix), which has four toes to the front feet and five to&nbsp;the hinder. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chab abdominalis,</span><span class="font0"> Thunberg, has four toes&nbsp;on each foot. Lastly, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chal.flavescens,</span><span class="font0"> Gray </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Uιab rnono-dactylus,</span><span class="font0"> Daudin), is distinguished by five anterior and&nbsp;three posterior toes, so reduced in size as to resemble&nbsp;small tubercles, and so ill defined by nature (to our perceptions, though no doubt wisely formed in relation to the&nbsp;end in view) that zoologists still differ as to their exact&nbsp;amount. The species alluded to is native to Guiana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The genus Chirotes, Cuv. resembles </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chalcides</span><span class="font0"> in its verticillated scales, and is allied to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Amphisbwna</span><span class="font0"> by the&nbsp;blunted form of its head ; but it is distinguished from the former by the absence of the hind legs, and from the latter&nbsp;by the presence of the fore ones. (See Plate CCCCXXXIL&nbsp;fig. 7.) The only known species is the lumbriciform lizard&nbsp;of Shaw ( </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chir. Iumbricoides,—CanaliculatusofLae.),</span><span class="font0"> a native&nbsp;of Mexico, and first described by Lacépède. It has two&nbsp;short anterior feet (each with four toes, and the rudiments of&nbsp;a fifth), well organized interiorly, and attached to a small&nbsp;sternum by means of shoulder-blades and clavicles ; but&nbsp;the head, vertebrae, and the general skeleton, closely resemble those of the genus Amphisbæna. It is of a flesh&nbsp;colour, and measures eight or ten inches long, with a circumference like that of the little finger. It is surrounded by about 220 semi-rings upon the back, and as many&nbsp;on the abdomen, which meet upon the sides in alternation.&nbsp;The tongue of this species is but slightly extensile, and&nbsp;terminates in two little horny points. Its eye is extremely&nbsp;small, and the tympanum invisible outwardly, being covered by the skin. On dissection Baron Cuvier could detect&nbsp;in this reptile only a single large lung, with the vestige of&nbsp;a small one, as in serpents. It preys on insects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Order III—OPHIDIA. OPHIDIAN REPTILES.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This great division is distinguished by the absence of legs and other external members, and includes all manner&nbsp;of snakes and serpents. The expected completion of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Erpétologie Générale</span><span class="font0"> of MM. Dumeril and Bibron would&nbsp;have enabled us to present a more satisfactory sketch of&nbsp;their history and habits (which have been greatly embroiled by many modern authors), than we can otherwise attain&nbsp;to ; but the French writers just named have not as yet&nbsp;published the result of their labours among the ophidian&nbsp;tribes. In the mean time, we think it advisable to delay&nbsp;their consideration to a future time. Therefore see in this&nbsp;work the term Serpents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Order IV—BATRACHIA. BATRACHIAN REPTILES.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We now proceed to the fourth order of the class Reptilia, the Batrachia, a name derived from </span><span class="font1">Bαrjαχof, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a frog,</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;expressive of a general resemblance which very distinctly&nbsp;marks the majority, although in truth many resemble lizards,&nbsp;and a few have more the appearance of eels or serpents.&nbsp;This tribe is one of the most singular in nature ; for, besides&nbsp;the naked body and remarkable sanguineous circulation, they&nbsp;possess another peculiarity, which is regarded by many&nbsp;naturalists as sufficient to constitute them a distinct class&nbsp;rather than an order, viz. the change of form which they&nbsp;undergo in their progress from the young to the adult state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In this concluding order are ranked all those reptiles which have neither the carapace of the Chelonia nor the&nbsp;scales of the other orders. @@<sup>1</sup> Their bodies therefore are&nbsp;naked ; their head is without any distinct neck or division ;&nbsp;their toes are always distinct and without claws ; they have&nbsp;no external organs of reproduction, and usually undergo&nbsp;metamorphoses. This change of form constitutes the Ba-trachia the principal step in the transition between terrestrial and aquatic vertebrata or fishes, and is one of the&nbsp;most singular phenomena presented by animal life. Bred</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2">@@@ <sup>1 </sup>A curious link, we perceive, has recently been discovered in South America, between the Batrachia and the Chelonia, which is nothing less than a frog furnished with a carapace and plastron.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
