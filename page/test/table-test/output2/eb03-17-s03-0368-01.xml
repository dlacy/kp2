<hi rend="italic">Management of</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Ships</hi> <hi rend="italic">at single anchor,</hi> is the method of taking care of a ship while riding at ſingle anchor in a tide-way, by preventing her from fouling her anchor, &amp; c <hi rend="italic">.</hi> The following rules for this purpoſe, with which we have been favoured by Mr Henry Taylor<note anchored="true" n="3" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">[m]*</hi> Taylor's Instructions to Young Mariners Riding at Anchor in moderate Weather.</p></note> * of North Shields, will be found of the utmoſt conſequence.</p><p>Riding in a tide-way, with a freſh-of-wind, the ſhip ſhould have what is called <hi rend="italic">a short</hi> or w <hi rend="italic">indward ſervice, s</hi> ay 45 or 50 fathoms of cable, and always ſheered to windward<note anchored="true" n="4" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> It has been thought by ſome theoriſts, that ſhips ſhould be ſheered to leeward of their anchors ; but experience and the common practice of the beſt informed ſeamen are againſt that opinion : for it is found, that when a ſhip rides leeward tide and ſheered to windward, with the wind two or three points upon the bow, and blowing hard in the interval between the ſqualls, the ſheer will draw her towards the wind’s eye ; ſo that when the next squall comes, before ſhe be preſſed aſtream of her anchor, it is probable there will be a lull again, and the ſpring which the cable got by the ſheer will greatly eaſe it during the ſquall.</p><p>Every ſeaman knows that no ſhip without a rudder, or the helm left looſe, will wear ; they always in ſuch ſituations fly to : this proves that the wind preſſing upon the quarter and the helm alee, a ſhip will be less liable to break her ſheer than when the helm is a-weather. Beſides, if the helm is a-lee when ſhe breaks her ſheer, it will be a-weather when the wind comes on the other quarter, as it ought to be until ſhe either ſwing to leeward, or bring the buoy on the other quarter. Now if the ſhip breaks her ſheer with the helm a-weather, it throws her head to the wind ſo ſuddenly as ſcarce to give time to brace the yards about, and very probably ſhe will fall over? her anchor before the fore-ſtayſail can be got up.</p></note> (<hi rend="smallcaps">a),</hi> not always with the helm hard down, but more or leſs ſo according to the ſtrength or weak- neſs of the tide. It is a known fact, that many ſhips ſheer their anchors home, drive on board of other ſhips, and on the ſands near which they rode, before it has been diſcovered that the anchor had been moved from the place where it was let go.</p><p>When the wind is croſs, or nearly croſs, off ſhore, or in the oppoſite direction, ſhips will always back. This is done by the mizen-topſail, aſſiſted, if needful, by the mizen-stayſail ; ſuch as have no mizen-topſail commonly uſe the main-topſail, or if it blows freſh, a top- gallant-ſail, or any ſuch ſail at the gaff.</p><p>In backing, a ſhip ſhould always wind with a taught cable, that it may be certain the anchor is drawn round. In case there is not a ſufficiency of wind for that purpoſe, the ſhip ſhould be hove apeak.</p><p>Riding with the wind afore the beam, the yards ſhould be braced forward ; if abaft the beam, they are to be braced all aback.</p><p>If the wind is ſo far aft that the ſhip will net back (which ſhould not be attempted if, when the tide eaſes, the ſhip forges ahead, and brings the buoy on the lee quarter), ſhe muſt be ſet ahead : if the wind is far aft, and blows freſh, the utmoſt care and attention is neceſsary, as ſhips riding in this ſituation often break their ſheer, and come to windward of their anchors again. It ſhould be obſerved, that when the ſhip lies in this tickliſh ſituation, the after-yards muſt be braced forward, and the fore-yards the contrary way : ſhe will lay ſafe, as the buoy can be kept on the lee quarter, or ſuppoſe the helm is aport, as long as the buoy is on the larboard quarter. With the helm thus, and the wind right aft, or neatly ſo, the ſtarboard main and fore braces ſhould be hauled in. This ſuppoſes the main braces to lead forward.</p><p>When the ſhip begins to tend to leeward, and the buoy comes on the weather-quarter, the firſt thing to be done is to brace about the fore-yard ; and when the wind comes near the beam, ſet the fore-ſtayſail, and</p><p>keep it ſtanding until it ſhakes; then brace all the yards ſharp forward, eſpecially if it is likely to blow strong.</p><p>If laying in the aforeſaid poſition, and ſhe breaks her ſheer, brace about the main-yard immediately; if ſhe recovers and brings the buoy on the lee or larboard quarter, let the main-yard be again braced about; but if ſhe come to a ſheer the other way, by bringing the buoy on the other quarter, change the helm and brace the fore-yard to.</p><p>Riding leeward tide with more cable than the windward ſervice, and expecting the ſhip will go to windward of her anchor, begin as ſoon as the tide eaſes to ſhorten in the cable. This is often hard work ; but it is neceffary to be done, otherwiſe the anchor may be fouled by the great length of cable the ſhip has to draw round ; but even if that could be done, the cable would be damaged againſt the bows or cut-water. It is to be obſerved, that when a ſhip rides windward tide the cable ſhould be cackled from the ſhort ſervice towards the anchor, as far as will prevent the bare part touching the ſhip.</p><p>When the ſhip tends to windward and muſt be ſet a- head, hoiſt the fore-ſtayſail as ſoon as it will ſtand, and when the buoy comes on the leequarter, haul down the fore-ſtayſail, brace to the fore-yard, and put the helm a-lee ; for till then the helm muſt be kept a-weather and the yards full.</p><p>When the ſhip rides leeward tide, and the wind increaſes, care ſhould be taken to give her more cable in time, otherwiſe the anchor may ſtart, and probably it will be troubleſome to get her brought up a- gain ; and this care is the more necessary when the ſhip rides in the hauſe of another ship. Previous to giving a long ſervice it is uſual to take a weather-bit, that is, a turn of the cable over the windlaſs end, ſo that in veering away the ſhip will be under commend. I he ſervice ought to be greaſed, which will prevent its chafing in the hauſe.</p><p>If the gale continues to increaſe, the topmaſts ſhould be ſtruck in time ; but the fore-yard ſhould ſeldom, if ever, be lowered down, that in cafe of parting the fore-ſail may be ready to be ſet. At ſuch times there ſhould be more on deck than the common anchor-watch, that no accident may happen from inattention or falling aſleep.</p><p>In a tide-way a second anchor ſhould never be let go but when abſolutely necessary ; for a ſhip will ſome- times ride eaſier and ſafer, eſpecially if the ſea runs high, with a very long ſcope of cable and one anchor, than with<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0377.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0371"/>
leſs length and two cables; however, it is adviſable, as a preventive, when ſhips have not room to drive, and the night is dark, to let fall a ſecond anchor under foot, with a range of cable along the deck. If this is not thought neceſſary to be done, the deep-ſea lead ſhould be thrown overboard, and the line frequently handled by the watch, that they may be aſſured she rides faſt.</p><p>If at any time the anchor-watch, preſuming on their own knowledge, ſhould wind the ſhip, or ſuffer her to break her ſheer without calling the mate, he ſhould immediately, or the very firſt opportunity, oblige the crew to heave the anchor in fight ; which will prevent the commiſſion of the like fault again ; for beſides the ſhare of trouble the watch will have, the rest of the crew will blame them for neglecting their duty.</p><p>Prudent mates ſeldom lie a week in a road-ſtead without heaving their anchor in fight; even though they have not the leaſt ſuſpicion of its being foul. There are other reaſons why the anchor ſhould be looked at; ſometimes the cable receives damage by ſweeping wrecks or anchors that have been loſt, or from rocks or ſtones ; and it is often neceſſary to trip the anchor, in order to take a clearer birth, which ſhould be done as often as any ſhip brings up too near.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Method for the ſafe removal of ſuch</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Ships</hi> <hi rend="italic">as have been driven on ſhore.</hi> For this purpoſe empty caſks are uſually employed to float off the veſſel, eſpecially if ſhe is ſmall, and at the fame time near the port to which it is propoſed to conduct her. In other cases, the following method adopted by Mr Barnard<note anchored="true" n="5" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>[m]* Philosophical Transactions, vol. lxx. part 1.</p></note> * will anſwer.</p><p>"On January 1. 1779 (ſays Mr Barnard), in a moſt dreadful ſtorm, the York Eaſt Indiaman, of eight hundred tons, homeward bound, with a pepper cargo, parted her cables in Margate roads, and was driven on flrore, within one hundred feet of the head and thirty feet of the fide of Margate pier, then drawing twenty-two feet fix inches water, the flow of a good ſpring tide being only fourteen feet at that place.</p><p>“ On the third of the fame month I went down, as a ſhip-builder, to aſſiſt, as much as lay in my power, my worthy friend Sir Richard Hotham, to whom the ſhip belonged. I found her perfectly upright, and her ſhere for side appearance) the fame as when ſirſt built, but funk to the twelve feet water-mark fore and aft in a bed of chalk mixed with a ſtiff blue clay, exactly the ſhape of her body below that draft of water ; and from the rudder being torn from her as ſhe ſtruck coming on ſhore, and the violent agitation of the ſea after her being there, her ſtern was ſo greatly injured as to admit free access thereto, which filled her for four days equal to the flow of the tide. Having fully informed myſelf of her ſituation and the flow of ſpring-tides, and being clearly of opinion ſhe might be again got off, I recommended, as the firſt neceſſary ſtep, the immediate diſcharge of the cargo ; and, in the progreſs of that buſineſs, I found the tide always flowed to the fame height on the ſhip ; and when the cargo was half diſcharged, and I knew the remaining part ſhould not make her draw more than eighteen feet water, and while I was obſerving the water at twenty-two feet six inches by the ſhip’s marks, ſhe inſtantly lifted to ſeventeen feet eight inches ; the water and air being before excluded by her preffure on the clay, and the atmoſphere acting upon her upper part equal to fix hundred tons, which is the</p><p>weight of water diſplaced at the difference of theſe two drafts of water.</p><p>“ The moment the ſhip lifted, I diſcovered ſhe had received more damage than was at ſirſt apprehended, her leaks being ſuch as filled her from four to eighteen feet water in an hour and a half. As nothing effectual was to be expected from pumping, ſeveral ſcuttles or holes in the ſhip’s ſide were made, and valves fixed thereto, to draw off the water at the loweſt ebb of the tide, to facilitate the diſcharge oſ the remaining part of the cargo ; and, after many attempts, I ſucceeded in an external application of ſheep-ſkins ſewed on a fail and thruſt under the bottom, to ſtop the body of water from ruffling ſo furiouſly into the ſhip. This buſineſs effected, moderate pumping enabled us to keep the ſhip to about fix feet water at low water, and by a vigorous effort we could bring the ſhip ſo light as (when the cargo ſhould be all diſcharged) to be eaſily removed into deeper water. But as the external application might be diſturbed by ſo doing, or totally removed by the agitation of the ſhip, it was abſolutely neceſſary to provide ſome permanent ſecurity for the lives of thole who were to navigate her to the river Thames. I then recommended as the cheapeſt, quickeſt, and moſt effectual plan, to lay a deck in the hold, as low as the water could be pumped to, framed ſo ſolidly and ſecurely, and caulked ſo tight, as to ſwim the ſhip independent of her own leaky bottom.</p><p>“ Beams of ſir-timber twelve inches ſquare were placed in the hold under every lower-deck beam in the ſhip, as low as the water would permit ; theſe were in two pieces, for the conveniency of getting them down, and alſo for the better fixing them of an exact length, and well bolted together when in their places. Over theſe were laid long Dantzic deals of two inches and an half thick, well nailed and caulked. Againſt the ſhip’s ſide, all fore and aft, was well nailed a piece of fir twelve inches broad and fix inches thick on the lower and three inches on the upper edge, to prevent the deck from riſing at the fide. Over the deck, at every beam, was laid a croſs piece of fir timber fix inches deep and twelve inches broad, reaching from the pillar of the hold to the ſhip’s ſide, on which the ſhores were to be placed to reſiſt the preſſure of the water beneath. On each of theſe, and againſt the lower-deck beam, at equal diſtances from the ſide and middle oſ the ſhip, was placed an upright ſhore, fix inches by twelve, the lower end let two inches into the croſs piece. From the foot of this ſhore to the ship's ſide, under the end of every lower deck beam, was placed a diagonal ſhore fix inches by twelve, to eaſe the ſhip’s deck of part of the ſtrain by throwing it on the ſide. An upright ſhore of three inches by twelve was placed from the end of every croſs piece to the lower deck beams at the ſide, and one of three inches by twelve on the midſhip end of every croſs piece to the lower deck beam, and nailed to the pillars in the hold. Two firm tight bulkheads or partitions were made as near the extremes of the ſhip as poſſible. The ceiling or inſide plank of the ſhip was very ſecurely caulked up to the lower deck, and the whole formed a complete ſhip with a flat bottom within ſide, to ſwim the outside leaky one ; and that bottom being depreſſed six feet below the external water, reſiſted the ſhip’s weight above it equal to five hundred and eighty-one tons, and ſafely conveyed her to the dry-dock at Deptiord.”<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0378.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0372"/>
