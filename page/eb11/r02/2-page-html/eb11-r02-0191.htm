<p><span class="font1">REYNOLDS, WALTER (d. 1327), archbishop of Canterbury, was the son of a Windsor baker, and became a clerk, or chaplain,&nbsp;in the service of Edward I. He held several livings and, owing&nbsp;perhaps to his histrionic skill, he became a prime favourite&nbsp;with the prince of Wales, afterwards Edward II. Just after&nbsp;the prince became king [in 1307 Reynolds was appointed&nbsp;treasurer of England; in 1308 he became bishop of Worcester&nbsp;and in 1310 chancellor. When Robert Winchelsea, archbishop&nbsp;of Canterbury, died in May 1313 Edward II. prevailed upon&nbsp;Pope Clement V. to appoint his favourite to the vacant archbishopric, and Walter was enthroned at Canterbury in February 1314.&nbsp;Although the private life of the new archbishop appears to have&nbsp;been the reverse of exemplary he attempted to carry out some&nbsp;very necessary reforms in his new official capacity; he also&nbsp;continued the struggle for precedence, which had been carried&nbsp;on for many years between the archbishops of Canterbury and&nbsp;of York. In this connexion in 1317 he laid London under&nbsp;an interdict after William de Melton (d. 1340), archbishop of&nbsp;York, had passed through its streets with his cross borne erect&nbsp;before him. Reynolds remained in general loyal to Edward II.&nbsp;until 1324, when with all his suffragans he opposed the king&nbsp;in defence of the bishop of Hereford, Adam of Orlton. In the&nbsp;events which concluded Edward’s life and reign the archbishop&nbsp;played a contemptible part. Having fled for safety into Kent&nbsp;he returned to London and declared for Edward III., whom&nbsp;he crowned in February 1327. He died at Mortlake on the&nbsp;16th of November following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REZANOV, NICOLAI PETROVICH DE (1764-1807), Russian nobleman and administrator under Catherine II.,&nbsp;Paul I. and Alexander I., was one of the ten barons of Russia,&nbsp;and, for his services to the empire, was rewarded with the court&nbsp;title of chamberlain. In 1803 he was made a privy councillor&nbsp;and invested with the order of St Ann. He was also the author&nbsp;of a lexicon of the Japanese language and of several other&nbsp;works, which are preserved in the library of the St Petersburg&nbsp;Academy of Sciences, of which he was a member. He was the&nbsp;first Russian ambassador to Japan (1804), and instigated the&nbsp;first attempt of Russia to circumnavigate the globe (1803),&nbsp;commanding the expedition himself as far as Kamchatka. But&nbsp;Rezânov’s monument for many years after his death was the&nbsp;great Russian American Fur Company; and his interest to&nbsp;students of history centres round the policy involved in that&nbsp;enterprise, which, thwarted by his untimely death, would have&nbsp;changed the destinies of Russia and the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Meeting (in 1788) Shelikov, chief of the Shelikov-GoHkov Fur Company, Rezanov became interested in the merchant’s&nbsp;project to obtain a monopoly of the fur trade in those distant&nbsp;dependencies. Conscious of latent energies, and already tired&nbsp;of the pleasures of a dissolute court, he became a partner in&nbsp;the company, and rapidly developed into a keen and tireless&nbsp;man of business. At the death of Shelikov in 1795 he became&nbsp;thc leading spirit of the wealthy and amalgamated but harassed&nbsp;companies, and resolved to obtain for himself and his partners&nbsp;privileges analogous to those granted by Great Britain to the&nbsp;East India Company. He had just succeeded in persuading&nbsp;Catherine to sign his charter when she died, and he was obliged&nbsp;to begin again with the ill-balanced and intractable Paul. For&nbsp;a time the outlook was hopeless; but Rezânov’s skill, subtlety&nbsp;and address prevailed, and shortly before the assassination of&nbsp;the emperor Paul he obtained his signature to the momentous&nbsp;instrument which granted to the Russian-American Company,&nbsp;for a term of twenty years, dominion over the coast of N.W.&nbsp;America, from latitude 55 degrees northward; and over the&nbsp;chain of islands extending from Kamchatka northward and&nbsp;southward to Japan. This famous “ Trust,” which crowded out&nbsp;all the small companies and independent traders, was a source&nbsp;of large revenue to Rezânov and the other shareholders, including members of thc Imperial family, until the first years of the&nbsp;19th century, when mismanagement and scarcity of nourishing&nbsp;food threatened it with serious losses if not ultimate ruin.&nbsp;Rezânov, his humiliating embassy to Japan concluded, reached&nbsp;Kamchatka in 1805, and found commands awaiting him to&nbsp;remain in the Russian colonies as Imperial inspector and&nbsp;plenipotentiary of the company, and to correct the abuses that&nbsp;were ruining the great enterprise. He travelled slowly to&nbsp;Sitka by way of the Islands, establishing measures to protect&nbsp;the fur-bearing animals from reckless slaughter, punishing or&nbsp;banishing the worst offenders against the company’s laws, and&nbsp;introducing the civilizing influence of schools and libraries,&nbsp;most of the books being his personal gifts. He even established&nbsp;cooking schools, which flourished briefly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the end of a winter in Sitka, the headquarters of the company, during which he half-starved with the others, he&nbsp;bought a ship from a Y<sup>r</sup>ankee skipper and sailed for tbe Spanish&nbsp;settlements in California, purposing to trade his tempting cargo&nbsp;of American and Russian wares for food-stuffs, and to arrange&nbsp;a treaty by whose terms his colonies should be provisioned twice&nbsp;a year with the bountiful products of New Spain. He cast&nbsp;anchor in the harbour of San Francisco early in April 1806,&nbsp;after a stormy voyage which had defeated his intention to take&nbsp;possession of the Columbia river in the name of Russia. Although&nbsp;he was received with great courtesy and entertained night and&nbsp;day by the gay Californians, no time was lost in informing him&nbsp;that the laws of Spain forbade her colonies to trade with foreign&nbsp;powers, and that the governor of all the Californias was incorruptible. Rezânov, had it not been for a love affair with&nbsp;the daughter of the comandante of San Francisco, Don José&nbsp;Arguello, and for his personal address and diplomatic skill,&nbsp;with which he won over the clergy to his cause, would have&nbsp;failed again. As it was, when he sailed for Sitka, six weeks&nbsp;after his arrival, the “ Juno’s ” hold was full of bread-stuffs and&nbsp;dried meats, he had the promise of the perplexed governor to&nbsp;forward a copy of the treaty to Spain at once, and he was&nbsp;affianced to the most beautiful girl in California. Shortly after&nbsp;his arrival in Sitka he proceeded by water to Kamchatka,&nbsp;where he despatched bis ships to wrest the island Sakhalen of&nbsp;the lower Kurile group from Japan, then started overland for&nbsp;St Petersburg to obtain the signature of the tsar to the treaty,&nbsp;and also personal letters to the pope and king of Spain that he&nbsp;might ask for the dispensation and the royal consent necessary&nbsp;to his marriage. He died of fever and exhaustion in Krasnoiarsk,&nbsp;Siberia, on the 8th of March 1807.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The treaty with California, the bare suggestion of which made such a commotion in New Spain, was the least of Rezânov’s&nbsp;projects. It was sincerely conceived, for he was deeply and&nbsp;humanely concerned for his employees and the wretched natives&nbsp;who were little more than the slaves of the company; but its&nbsp;very obviousness raised the necessary amount of dust. His&nbsp;correspondence with the company, and with Zapinsky, betrays&nbsp;a clearly defined purpose to annex to Russia the entire western&nbsp;coast of North America, and to encourage immediate emigration from the parent country on a large scale. Had he lived,&nbsp;there is, all things considered, hardly a doubt that he would&nbsp;have accomplished his object. The treaty was never signed,&nbsp;the reforms of Rezânov died of discouragement, the fortunes of</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
