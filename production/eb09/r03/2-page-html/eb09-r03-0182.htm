<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">monio,</span><span class="font2"> was produced with success at the Teatro San Mosè at Venice in 1810. In 1811 he produced </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">HEquivoco&nbsp;Stravagante,</span><span class="font2"> at Bologna; but his first real triumph was&nbsp;achieved at Venice in 1812, in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">HInganno felice,</span><span class="font2"> a work&nbsp;in which his genius unmistakably asserted itself. In the&nbsp;same year he produced </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Pietra del Paragone,</span><span class="font2"> with equal&nbsp;applause, at Milan, besides four other operas in other&nbsp;places. These pieces were all successful, but </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tancredi,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">written for the Teatro San Fenice at Venice, in 1813,&nbsp;produced a veritable </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">furore.</span><span class="font2"> The name of the young&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">maestro</span><span class="font2"> was now famous ; yet, strange to say, his greatest&nbsp;comic opera was hissed on its first performance at Rome&nbsp;in 1816. This delightful inspiration, first entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Alma-viva,</span><span class="font2"> but now known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Il Barbiere di Siviglia,</span><span class="font2"> was&nbsp;founded on a libretto which Paisiello had already treated&nbsp;with success, and hence the refusal of the Roman audience&nbsp;to tolerate it. But the beauty of the music overcame&nbsp;the scruples of the most prejudiced listeners, and, by the&nbsp;time the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Barbixre</span><span class="font2"> reached its third representation, Rossini&nbsp;was openly accepted as the greatest dramatic composer in&nbsp;Italy. Between 1815 and 1823 Rossini composed no less&nbsp;than twenty operas, including his masterpieces </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Elisabetta&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(1815), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Il Barbiere</span><span class="font2"> (1816), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Otello</span><span class="font2"> (1816), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Cenerentola&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(1817), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Gazza LaRra</span><span class="font2"> (1817), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mosè in Egitto</span><span class="font2"> (1818),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Le Donna del Lago</span><span class="font2"> (1819), and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Semiramide</span><span class="font2"> (1823), the&nbsp;last of which has lately been revived, with so great&nbsp;success, by Madame Adelina Patti.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rossini visited England in 1823, and in 1824 accepted an engagement as musical director of the Théâtre Italien&nbsp;in Paris, where, in 1829, he produced his last great&nbsp;masterpiece, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Guillaume TeU.</span><span class="font2"> After completing this beautiful work, he composed no more until 1832, when he wrote&nbsp;the first six movements of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Stabat Mater</span><span class="font2"> for private&nbsp;performance only. He completed this lovely composition&nbsp;in 1839, and it was first publicly performed at the Salle&nbsp;Ventadour in 1842. In 1855 he settled permanently in&nbsp;Paris, at 2 Rue Chaussée d’Antin, where he composed&nbsp;his last work, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Petite Messe Solennelle,</span><span class="font2"> which was first&nbsp;privately performed at the house of M. Pillet Will,&nbsp;March 16, 1864, and posthumously produced at the&nbsp;Théâtre Italien February 28, 1869. Rossini was twice&nbsp;married—to Isabella Colbran in 1821, and in 1847&nbsp;to Olympe Pelissier. After his final return to Paris&nbsp;he spent a part of every year in a suburban villa in the&nbsp;Avenue Ingres, at Passy, and here he died of a very painful illness, November 13, 1868. He was buried at the&nbsp;church of the Trinité, November 21, with every possible&nbsp;honour. He was a foreign associate of the Institute,&nbsp;“ grand officer of the Legion of Honour,” the recipient of&nbsp;innumerable orders, and a member of innumerable musical&nbsp;institutions. Honour was justly lavished upon him ; and,&nbsp;though his career was not free from temporary misfortunes,&nbsp;probably no man of genius ever lived a happier life, or&nbsp;enjoyed more fully the appreciation both of brother artists&nbsp;and the general public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rossini effected a complete revolution in the style of Italian opera. His accompaniments were richer than any that had ever&nbsp;been previously heard in Italy, and in their masterly instrumentation rivalled some of the most notable achievements of German&nbsp;art. His use of the crescendo and the “ cabaletta, ” though sometimes carried to excess, gave a brilliancy to his music which added&nbsp;greatly to the excellence of its effect. He first accompanied his&nbsp;recitatives with the stringed orchestra in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ElisabeUa,</span><span class="font1"> and with&nbsp;stringed and wind instruments combined in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Otetta</span><span class="font1"> And his&nbsp;overtures are by far the most masterly and complete compositions of the kind that the Italian school has ever produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROSTOCK, the largest town of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and one of the most important commercial cities on the&nbsp;Baltic, is situated on the left bank of the estuary of the&nbsp;Warnow, about eight miles from the sea. It lies 177 miles&nbsp;north-west of Berlin by railway, 80 miles north-east of&nbsp;Lübeck, and 106 miles south of Copenhagen. The city&nbsp;consists of three parts—the old town to the east, and the&nbsp;middle and new towns to the west—of which the first retains&nbsp;some of the antique features of an old Hanse town, while&nbsp;the last two are for the most part regularly and even handsomely built. There are several fine squares in Rostock,&nbsp;among them the Blücher Platz, with a statue of Field-marshal&nbsp;Blücher, who was born in the town in 1742. Rostock was&nbsp;at one time a fortress of some strength, but the old&nbsp;fortifications have been razed, and their site is noλv occupied by a promenade. Within the last twenty years the&nbsp;suburbs have considerably extended themselves. Rostock&nbsp;has five old parochial churches :—St Mary’s, dating from&nbsp;1398-1472, one of the most imposing Gothic buildings in&nbsp;Mecklenburg; St Nicholas’s, begun about 1250 and restored in 1450 ; St Peter’s, with a lofty tower built in 1400,&nbsp;which serves as a landmark to ships 20 miles at sea ; St&nbsp;James’s, completed in 1588; and the church of the Holy&nbsp;Rood, begun in 1270, but now no longer used for&nbsp;service. St Mary’s church contains a monument marking&nbsp;the original tomb of Grotius, who died in Rostock in 1645,&nbsp;though his remains were afterwards removed to Delft.&nbsp;Among the other interesting buildings are the curious&nbsp;14th-century Gothic town-house, the façade of which is&nbsp;concealed by a Renaissance addition; the palace of the grand&nbsp;duke of Mecklenburg-SchAverin, built in 1702; the law&nbsp;courts, built in 1878-79; and the new university&nbsp;buildings, erected in 1867-70. The university of Rostock&nbsp;was founded in 1418 by the dukes Johann III. and&nbsp;Albrecht V. From 1437 till 1443 it had its seat at&nbsp;Greifswald in consequence of commotions at Rostock ; and&nbsp;in 1760 it was again removed—on this occasion to&nbsp;Bützow. The professors appointed by the city, however,&nbsp;still taught there, so that there were practically two&nbsp;universities in the duchy until 1789, when they were&nbsp;reunited at the original seat. In winter 1884-5 the university had a teaching staff of 39, with 265 students; and it&nbsp;possesses a library of 145,000 volumes, various collections&nbsp;and museums, and a number of scientific and literary&nbsp;auxiliary institutions. Rostock is the seat of the supreme&nbsp;court for both the duchies of Mecklenburg, and is well&nbsp;equipped with schools, hospitals, and other institutions.&nbsp;The population in 1810 was 10,979; in 1880 it was&nbsp;36,967, of whom only 224 were Roman Catholics, and&nbsp;only 221 were Jews; in 1885 it was 39,212.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although the population, commerce, and wealth of Rostock have all declined since its palmy days as a flourishing Hanse town in&nbsp;the Middle Ages, it has still a very considerable trade, and no&nbsp;Baltic port possesses so large a merchant fleet. In 1882 314 ships,&nbsp;with a total burden of 97,447 tons, were registered as belonging to&nbsp;Rostock ; and in 1832 730 ships, with a total burden of 80,578&nbsp;tons entered, and 724 ships, with a total burden of 82,537 tons,&nbsp;cleared, the port. Ships of more than 200 tons burden must&nbsp;discharge part of their cargo at AVarnemiinde, at the mouth of the&nbsp;Warnow, the port of Rostock, a fishing village and watering place&nbsp;with 1766 inhabitants, who are distinguished by a peculiar dialect&nbsp;and costume. By far the most important export of Rostock is&nbsp;grain, which goes almost entirely to British ports ; but wool, flax,&nbsp;and cattle are also shipped. The chief imports are coal from Great&nbsp;Britain, herrings from Sweden, petroleum from America, timber,&nbsp;wine, and colonial goods. Rostock has an important fair at&nbsp;Whitsuntide, lasting for fourteen days, and also a frequented wool&nbsp;and cattle market. The industries of the town are very varied.&nbsp;One of the chief ^is shipbuilding, which, however, has declined&nbsp;of late years. Cotton, straw hats, tobacco, carpets, soap, cards,&nbsp;chocolate, and dye-stuffs are among the manufactures of the town,&nbsp;which also contains distilleries, saw-mills, oil-mills, tanneries, and&nbsp;breweries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Local historians assert that a village existed on the site of Rostock as early as 329 </span><span class="font0">A.υ., </span><span class="font1">but no certain proofs have been traced&nbsp;of any earlier community than that founded here by Pribislaw IL in&nbsp;the 12th century, which is said to have received town rights in 1218.&nbsp;The earliest signs of commercial prosperity date from about 1260.&nbsp;For a time Rostock was under the dominion of the kings of Denmark. Soon after returning into the protection of Mecklenburg in&nbsp;1317, it joined the Hanseatic League; and in fact was one of the&nbsp;original members of the powerful and prosperous AVendish Hansa, in</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
