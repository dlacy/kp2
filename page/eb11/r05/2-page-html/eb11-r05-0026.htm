<p><span class="font0">on the line between Bologna and Padua, with branches to Legnago and Chioggia. The architecture of the town bears&nbsp;the stamp both of Venetian and of Ferrarese influence. The&nbsp;cathedral church of Santo Stefano (1696) is of less interest than&nbsp;La Madonna del Soccorso, an octagon with a fine campanile,&nbsp;begun in 1594 by Francesco Zamberlano of Bassano, a pupil of&nbsp;Palladio. The town hall contains a library including some&nbsp;rare early editions, belonging to the Accademia de’ Concordi,&nbsp;founded in 1580, and a fair picture gallery enriched with the&nbsp;spoils of the monasteries. The Palazzo Roncali is a fine Renaissance building by Sanmicheli (1555). Two towers of its&nbsp;medieval castle remain. Wool, silk, linen and leather are&nbsp;among the local manufactures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rovigo (Neo-Latin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhodigium)</span><span class="font0"> appears to be mentioned as Rodigo in 838. It was selected as his residence by the bishop&nbsp;of Adria on the destruction of his city by the Huns. From&nbsp;the nth to the 14th century the Este family was usually in&nbsp;authority; but the Venetians took the place by siege in 1482&nbsp;and retained possession of it by the peace of 1484, and though&nbsp;the Este more than once recovered it, the Venetians, returning&nbsp;in 1514, retained possession till the French Revolution. In&nbsp;1806 the city was made a duchy in favour of General Savary.&nbsp;The Austrians in 1815 created it a royal city.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(T. As.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROVUMA, a river in East Africa, forming during the greater part of its course the boundary between German and Portuguese&nbsp;territory. The lower Rovuma is formed by the junction in&nbsp;n°25'S.,38°3i'E. of two branches of nearly equal importance,&nbsp;the longer of which, the Lujenda, comes from the south-west,&nbsp;the other, which still bears the name Rovuma, from the&nbsp;west. Its source lies on an undulating plateau, 3000 ft.&nbsp;high, immediately to the east of Lake Nyasa, in io° 45' S.,&nbsp;35° 40' E., the head-stream flowing first due west before turning&nbsp;south and east. In its eastward course the Rovuma flows&nbsp;near the base of the escarpment of an arid sandstone plateau&nbsp;to the north, from which direction the streams, which have cut&nbsp;themselves deep channels in the plateau edge, have almost&nbsp;all short courses. On the opposite bank the Rovuma receives,&nbsp;besides the Lujenda, the Msinje and Luchulingo, flowing in&nbsp;broad valleys running from south to north. The Lujenda&nbsp;rises in close proximity to Lake Chilwa, in the small Lake&nbsp;Chiuta (1700 ft.), the swamps to the south of this being separated&nbsp;from Chilwa'only by a narrow wooded ridge. The stream which&nbsp;issues from Chiuta passes by a swampy valley into the narrow&nbsp;Lake Amaramba, from which the Lujenda finally issues as a&nbsp;stream 80 yds. wide. Lower down it varies greatly in width,&nbsp;containing in many parts long wooded islands which rise above&nbsp;the flood level, and are often inhabited. The river is fordable&nbsp;in many places in the dry season. At its mouth it is about a&nbsp;mile wide. The lower Rovuma, which is often half a mile&nbsp;wide but generally shallow, flows through a swampy valley&nbsp;flanked by plateau escarpments containing several small backwaters of the river. The mouth, which lies in io° 28' S.,&nbsp;40° 30' E., is entirely in German territory, the boundary near&nbsp;the coast being formed by the parallel of io° 40'. The length&nbsp;of the Rovuma is about 500 m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROW, JOHN (c. 1525-1580), Scottish reformer, was born near Stirling and educated in that town and at St Andrews,&nbsp;where he began to practise as an advocate in the consistorial&nbsp;court. In 1550 he was sent to Rome in the interests of John&nbsp;Hamilton, archbishop of St Andrews, and attracted the notice&nbsp;of the highest authorities, who,’when his failing health drove&nbsp;him back to Scotland in 1558, nominated him papal nuncio to&nbsp;inquire into the spread of heresy in that country. That inquiry ultimately led him to change his faith. Much influenced&nbsp;by Knox’s preaching, he joined the reformers and in April&nbsp;1560 was admitted minister of Kennoway in Fife, and in July&nbsp;of the same year minister of the Old or Middle Church at Perth.&nbsp;He was one of the commission of six who drew up the “ Confession of Faith ” and the <sup>u</sup> First Book of Discipline,” and&nbsp;during the struggle with Queen Mary was often employed on&nbsp;important engagements. He was moderator of the Church&nbsp;Assembly at Edinburgh in July 1567 and at Perth in the following December, and again in Edinburgh 1576 and Stirling 1578.&nbsp;Meanwhile he helped to compile the “ Second Book of Discipline,”&nbsp;and became more than ever opposed to the Episcopal system of&nbsp;church government. He was a considerable scholar and is said&nbsp;to have been the first to teach Hebrew in Scotland. He died&nbsp;at Perth on the 16th of October 1580.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His son John Row (1568-1646), minister of Camock, wrote a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Historic of the Kirk of Scotland 1558 to 1637,</span><span class="font0"> which was continued to 1639 by his son, the third John Row </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(c.</span><span class="font0"> 1598-c. 1672),&nbsp;rector of the Perth grammar school and then (appointed by&nbsp;Cromwell) principal of King’s College, Aberdeen, who, with his&nbsp;father and grandfather was a famour Hebraist, but left the&nbsp;Church of Scotland to become an Independent minister. This&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Historie</span><span class="font0"> was published by the Wodrow Society and by the&nbsp;Maitland Club in 1842.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROWE, NICHOLAS (1674-1718), English dramatist and miscellaneous writer, son of John Rowe (d. 1692), barrister and serjeant-at-law, was baptized at Little Barford in Bedfordshire on the 30th of June 1674. Nicholas Rowe was educated&nbsp;at Westminster School under Dr Busby. He became in 1688&nbsp;a King’s Scholar, and entered the Middle Temple in 1691. On&nbsp;his father’s death he became the master of an independent&nbsp;fortune. His first play, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Ambitious Stepmother,</span><span class="font0"> the scene&nbsp;of which is laid in Persepolis, was produced in 1700, and was&nbsp;followed in 1702 by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tamerlane.</span><span class="font0"> In this play the conqueror&nbsp;represented William III., and Louis XIV. is denounced as&nbsp;Bajazet. It was for many years regularly acted on the anniversary of William’s landing at Torbay. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Fair Penitent&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1703), an adaptation of Massinger and Field’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fatal Dowry,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">was pronounced by Dr Johnson to be one of the most pleasing&nbsp;tragedies in the language. In it occurs the famous character&nbsp;of Lothario, whose name passed into current use as the equivalent of a rake. Calista is said to have suggested to Samuel&nbsp;Richardson the character of Clarissa Harlowe, as Lothario&nbsp;suggested Lovelace. In 1704 Rowe tried his hand at comedy,&nbsp;producing </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Biter</span><span class="font0"> at Lincoln’s Inn Fields. The play is said&nbsp;to have amused no one except the author, and Rowe returned&nbsp;to tragedy in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span><span class="font0"> (1706). </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Royal Convert</span><span class="font0"> (1707) dealt&nbsp;with the persecutions endured by Aribert, son of Hengist and&nbsp;the Christian maiden Ethelinda. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Tragedy of Jane Shore,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which was played at Drury Lane with Mrs Oldfield in the title-rdle in 1714, ran for nineteen nights, and kept the stage longer&nbsp;than any of his other works. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Tragedy of Lady Jane Grey&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">followed in 1715. Rowe’s friendship with Pope, who speaks&nbsp;affectionately of his vivacity and gaiety of disposition, led to&nbsp;attacks inspired by the publisher Edmund Curll, the best&nbsp;known of these being </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The New Rehearsal, or Bays the Younger,&nbsp;containing an Examen of Seven of Rowe’s Plays,</span><span class="font0"> by Charles&nbsp;Gildon. Rowe acted as under-secretary (1709-11) to the duke&nbsp;of Queensberry when he was principal secretary of state for&nbsp;Scotland. On the accession of George I. he was made a surveyor of customs, and in 1715 he succeeded Nahum Tate as&nbsp;poet laureate. He was also appointed clerk of the council to&nbsp;the prince of Wales, and in 1718 was nominated by Lord&nbsp;Chancellor Parker as clerk of the presentations in Chancery.&nbsp;He died on the 6th of December 1718, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. He was twice married, and his widow received a pension from George I. in 1719 in recognition of her&nbsp;husband’s translation of Lucan. This verse translation, or&nbsp;rather paraphrase of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pharsalia,</span><span class="font0"> was called by Samuel&nbsp;Johnson “ one of the greatest productions in English poetry,”&nbsp;and was widely read, running through eight editions between&nbsp;1718 and 1807.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rowe was the first modem editor of Shakespeare. It is unfortunate that he based his text (6 vols., 1709) on the corrupt&nbsp;Fourth Folio, a course in which he was followed by later editors.&nbsp;We owe to him the preservation of a number of Shakespearian&nbsp;traditions, collected for him at Stratford by Thomas Betterton.&nbsp;These materials he used with considerable judgment in the&nbsp;memoir prefixed to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Works.</span><span class="font0"> Moreover, his practical knowledge of the stage suggested technical improvements. He&nbsp;divided the play into acts and scenes on a reasonable method,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
