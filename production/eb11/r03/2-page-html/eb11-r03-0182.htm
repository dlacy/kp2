<p><span class="font1">defended Lusignan with great valour when it was besieged by the Catholics (1574-75). His son Henry, the first duke of&nbsp;Rohan, also distinguished himself in the Protestant army.&nbsp;His only child, Marguerite de Rohan, married in 1645 Henri&nbsp;Chabot, a cadet of a great family of Poitou. This marriage&nbsp;was opposed by hef mother, Marguerite de Bethune, who put&nbsp;forward a rival heir called Tancred, whom she claimed to be&nbsp;her son by the duke of Rohan. This Tancred perished in the&nbsp;Fronde in 1649. The property and titles of Henry de Rohan&nbsp;thus passed to the Chabot family, which under the name of&nbsp;Rohan-Chabot produced some distinguished soldiers and -a&nbsp;cardinal archbishop of Besançon. The male line of the Rohans&nbsp;is now represented by an offshoot of the Rohan-Guéménée&nbsp;branch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROHAN, HENRI, Duc </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">de</span><span class="font1"> (1579-1638), French soldier, writer and leader of the Huguenots, was born at the château of Blain,&nbsp;in Brittany, in 1579. His father was René II., count of Rohan&nbsp;(1550-86), and head of one of the oldest and most distinguished&nbsp;families in France, which was connected with many of the&nbsp;reigning houses of Europe. He was educated by his mother,&nbsp;who was a woman of exceptional learning and force of character.&nbsp;Rohan was by birth the second son, but his elder brother René&nbsp;dying young he became the heir of the name. He appeared at&nbsp;court and in the army at the age of sixteen, and was a special&nbsp;favourite with Henry IV., after whom, failing the house of&nbsp;Condé, he might be said to be the natural chief of the French&nbsp;Protestants. Having served till the peace of Vervins, he&nbsp;travelled for a considerable time over Europe, including England&nbsp;and Scotland, in the first of which countries he received the&nbsp;not unique honour of being called by Elizabeth her knight,&nbsp;while in the second he was godfather at Charles I/s christening.&nbsp;On his return to France he was made duke and peer at the age&nbsp;of twenty-four, and two years later (1603) married Marguerite&nbsp;de Béthune, the duc de Sully’s daughter. He served in high&nbsp;command at the celebrated siege of Jülich in 1610, but soon&nbsp;afterwards he fell into active or passive opposition to the government over the religious disputes. For a time, however, he&nbsp;abstained from actual insurrection, and he endeavoured to&nbsp;keep on terms with Marie de’ Medici; he even, despite his&nbsp;dislike of De Luynes, the favourite of Louis XIII., reappeared&nbsp;in the army and fought in Lorraine and Piedmont. It was not&nbsp;till the decree for the restitution of church property in the&nbsp;south threw the Bearnese and Gascons into open revolt that&nbsp;Rohan appeared as a rebeL His authority and military skill&nbsp;were very formidable to the royalists; his constancy and firmness greatly contributed to the happy issue of the war for the&nbsp;Huguenots, and brought about the treaty of Montpellier (1623).&nbsp;But Rohan did not escape the results of the incurable factiousness which showed itself more strongly perhaps among the&nbsp;French Huguenots than among any other of the numerous&nbsp;armed oppositions of the 17th century. He was accused of&nbsp;lukewarmness and treachery, though he did not hesitate to&nbsp;renew the war when the compact of Montpellier was broken.&nbsp;Again a hollow peace was patched up, but it lasted but a short&nbsp;time, and Rohan undertook a third war (1627-29), the first&nbsp;events of which are recounted in his celebrated </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs.</span><span class="font1"> This&nbsp;last war (famous for the defence of La Rochelle by Soubise,&nbsp;Rohan’s younger brother) was one of considerable danger for&nbsp;Rohan. In spite of all efforts he had in the end to sign a&nbsp;peace, and after this he made his way quickly to Venice. Here&nbsp;he is said to have received from the Porte the offer of the&nbsp;sovereignty of Cyprus. It is more certain that his hosts of&nbsp;Venice wished to make him their general-in-chief, a design&nbsp;not executed owing to the,peace of Cherasco (1631). At Venice&nbsp;he wrote his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs,</span><span class="font1"> at Padua, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Le Parfait Capitaine.</span><span class="font1"> But&nbsp;when France began to play a more conspicuous part in the&nbsp;Thirty Years’ War Rohan was again called to serve his lawful&nbsp;sovereign, and entrusted with the war in the Valtelline. The&nbsp;campaign of 1633 was completely successful, but Rohan was&nbsp;still considered dangerous to France, and was soon again in&nbsp;retirement. At this time he wrote his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Traité du gouvernement&nbsp;des treize cantons.</span><span class="font1"> Rohan fought another Valtelline campaign,&nbsp;but without the success of the first, for the motives of France&nbsp;were now held in suspicion. The unfortunate commander&nbsp;retired to Geneva and thence went to the army of Bernhard&nbsp;of Saxe-Weimar. He received a mortal wound at the battle&nbsp;of Rhcinfelden on the 28th of February 1638, and died at the&nbsp;abbey of Königsfeld, canton Berne, on the 13th of April. His&nbsp;body was buried at Geneva, and his arms were solemnly&nbsp;handed over to the Venetian government. With his daughter&nbsp;AIarguerite the honours of the family of Rohan-Gie passed to&nbsp;the house of Chabot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rohan’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mémoires sur les choses qui se sont passées en France,</span><span class="font1"> &amp;c., rank amongst the best products of the singular talent for memoir&nbsp;writing which the French </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">noblesse</span><span class="font1"> of the 16th and 17th centuries&nbsp;possessed. Alike in style, in clearness of matter and in shrewdness, they deserve very high praise. The first three books, dealing&nbsp;with the civil wars, appeared in 164^4; the fourth, containing the&nbsp;narrative of the Valtelline campaigns, not till 1758. Some&nbsp;suspicions were thrown on the genuineness of the latter, but,&nbsp;it would seem, groundlessly. His famous book on the history&nbsp;and art of war, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Le Parfait Capitaine,</span><span class="font1"> appeared in </span><span class="font0">1631 </span><span class="font1">and subsequently in 1637 and 1693 (see also Quincy, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Art de la guerre,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Paris, 1741). It treats of the history and lessons of Caesar’s campaigns and their application to modern warfare, and contains&nbsp;appendices dealing with phalangite and legionary methods of&nbsp;fighting and the art of war in general. He also wrote an account&nbsp;of his travels, the book on Switzerland mentioned above, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De&nbsp;l’intérêt des princes et états de la chrétienté,</span><span class="font1"> etc. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs</span><span class="font1"> may&nbsp;be conveniently found in the collection of Michaud and Poujoulat,&nbsp;vol. 19.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROHAN, LOUIS RENÉ ÉDOUARD, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cardinal de</span><span class="font1"> (1734-1803), prince de Rohan-Guéménée, archbishop of Strassburg, a cadet of the great family of Rohan (which traced its origin&nbsp;to the kings of Brittany, and was granted the precedence and&nbsp;rank of a foreign princely family by Louis XIV.), was born at&nbsp;Paris on the 25th of September 1734. Membersofthe Rohan&nbsp;family had filled the office of archbishop of Strassburg from&nbsp;1704—an office which made them princes of the empire and the&nbsp;compeers rather of the German prince-bishops than of the French&nbsp;ecclesiastics. For this high office Louis de Rohan was destined&nbsp;from his birth, and soon after taking orders, in 1760, he was&nbsp;nominated coadjutor to his uncle, Constantine de Rohan-Rochefort, who then held the archbishopric, and he was also&nbsp;consecrated bishop of Canopus. But he preferred the elegant&nbsp;life and the gaiety of Paris to his clerical duties, and had also an&nbsp;ambition to make a figure in politics. He joined the party&nbsp;opposed to the Austrian alliance, which had been cemented&nbsp;by the marriage of the archduchess Marie Antoinette to the&nbsp;dauphin. This party was headed by the duc d’Aiguillon, who&nbsp;in 1771 sent Prince Louis on a special embassy to Vienna to&nbsp;find out what was being done there with regard to the partition&nbsp;of Poland. Rohan arrived at Vienna in January 1772, and&nbsp;made a great noise with his lavish fêtes. But the empress Maria&nbsp;Theresa was implacably hostile to him ; not only did he attempt&nbsp;to thwart her policy, but he spread scandals about her daughter&nbsp;Marie Antoinette, laughed at herself, and shocked her ideas of&nbsp;propriety by his dissipation and luxury. On the death of&nbsp;Louis XV. in 1774, Rohan Was recalled from Vienna, and&nbsp;coldly, received at Paris; but the influence of his family was&nbsp;too great for him to be neglected, and in 1777 he was made&nbsp;grand almoner, and in 1778 abbot of St Vaast. In 1778 he&nbsp;was made a cardinal on the nomination of Stanislaus Poniatowski, king of Poland, and in the following year succeeded&nbsp;his uncle as archbishop of Strassburg and became abbot of&nbsp;Noirmoutiers and<sup>x</sup> Chaise-Dieu. His various preferments&nbsp;brought him in an income of two and a half millions of livres;&nbsp;yet the cardinal was restless and unhappy until he should be&nbsp;reinstated in favour at court and had appeased the animosity&nbsp;which Marie Antoinette felt against him. In pursuit of this&nbsp;object he fell into the hands of a gang of intriguers, the comtesse&nbsp;de Lamotte, the notorious Cagliostro and others, whose actions</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
