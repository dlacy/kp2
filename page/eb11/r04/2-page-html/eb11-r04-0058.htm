<p><span class="font0">to one another: hence there is no Roman mythology. Yet, all-powerful in their individual spheres of action, they can influence the fortunes of men and can enter into relations with them. The&nbsp;primary attitude of man to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">numina</span><span class="font0"> seems clearly to be one&nbsp;of fear, which survives prominently in the ** impish ” character of&nbsp;certain of the spirits of the countryside, such as Faunus and lnuus,&nbsp;and is always seen in the underlying conception of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">religio,</span><span class="font0"> a sense of&nbsp;awe in the presence of a superhuman power. But the practical&nbsp;mind of the Roman gives this relation a legal turn: the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ius sacrum,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which regulates the dealings of men with the divine powers, is an&nbsp;inseparable part of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ius publicum,</span><span class="font0"> the body of civil law, and the&nbsp;various acts of worship, prayer and thanksgiving are conceived of&nbsp;under the legal aspect of a contract. The base-notion is that the&nbsp;spirits, if they are given their due, will make a return to man: the&nbsp;object of the recurring annual festivals is to propitiate them and&nbsp;forestall any hostile intention by putting them, as it were, in debt to&nbsp;mail—more rarely to express gratitude for benefits received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In such a religion exactness of ritual must play a large part —so large, indeed, that many modern critics have been&nbsp;misled into regarding the Roman religion as a mere&nbsp;network of formalities without any background of&nbsp;genuine religious feeling. This formalism shows itself in many&nbsp;ways. It is necessary in the first place to make quite certain&nbsp;that the right deity is being addressed: hence it is well to&nbsp;invoke all the spirits who might be concerned, and even to add&nbsp;a general formula to cover omissions: here we have the ritual&nbsp;significance of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">indigitamenta.</span><span class="font0"> Place, again, as we have&nbsp;seen, was an essential element even in the conception of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">numen,</span><span class="font0"> and is therefore all-important in ritual. So, too, is the&nbsp;character of the offering: male victims must be sacrificed to&nbsp;male deities; female victims to goddesses: white animals&nbsp;are the due of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">di superi,</span><span class="font0"> the gods of the upper world, black&nbsp;animals of the gods below. Special deities, moreover, will&nbsp;demand special victims, while the more rustic </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">numina,</span><span class="font0"> such as&nbsp;Pales ($.t&gt;.), should be given milk and millet cakes rather than&nbsp;a blood-offering. All-important, too, is the order of ceremonial&nbsp;and the formula of prayer: a mistake or omission or an unpro-pitious interruption may vitiate the whole ritual, and though&nbsp;such misfortunes may occasionally be expiated by the additional offering of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">piaculum,</span><span class="font0"> in more serious cases the whole&nbsp;ceremony must be recommenced </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ab initio.</span><span class="font0"> Herein lies the&nbsp;importance of the priesthood: the priest is not, as in other&nbsp;religions, the mediator between god and man, but on the one&nbsp;hand for the purpose of state-worship the chosen representative&nbsp;of the whole people, on the other the repository of tradition</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and ritual lore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This conception of the nature of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">numina</span><span class="font0"> and man’s relation to them is the root notion of the old Roman religion,&nbsp;and the fully-formed state cult of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">di indigetes</span><span class="font0"> even&nbsp;at the earliest historical period, must have been the&nbsp;result of long and gradual development, of which we&nbsp;can to a certain extent trace the stages. The original settlement on the Palatine, like its neighbour on the Quirinal, was&nbsp;an agricultural community, whose unit both from the legal&nbsp;and religious point of view was not the individual but the household. The household is thus at once the logical starting-point&nbsp;of religious cult, and throughout Roman history the centre of&nbsp;its most real and vital activity. The head of the house </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(paterfamilias}</span><span class="font0"> is the natural priest and has control of the domestic&nbsp;worship: he is assisted by his sons as acolytes </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(camilli}</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;deputes certain portions of the ritual to his wife and daughters&nbsp;and even to his bailiff </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(vilicus)</span><span class="font0"> and his bailiff’s wife. The&nbsp;worship centres round certain </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">numina,</span><span class="font0"> the spirits indwelling&nbsp;in the sacred places of the original round hut in which the&nbsp;family lived. Janus, the god of the door, comes undoubtedly&nbsp;first, though unfortunately we know but little of his worship&nbsp;in the household, except that it was the concern of the men.&nbsp;To the women is committed the worship of the “ blazing hearth,”&nbsp;Vesta, the natural centre of the family life, and it is noticeable&nbsp;that even to Ovid </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Fast.</span><span class="font0"> vi. 291-92) the conception of Vesta&nbsp;was still material and not anthropomorphic. The Penates&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font0"> were the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">numina</span><span class="font0"> of the store-cupboard, at first vague&nbsp;and animistic, but later on, as the definite &lt;/cHS-notion was&nbsp;developed, identified with certain of the other divinities of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">household or state religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To these </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">numina</span><span class="font0"> of the sacred places must be added two other important conceptions, that of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lar familiaris</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Genius.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lar familiaris</span><span class="font0"> has been regarded<sup>@@1</sup> as the embodiment&nbsp;of all the family dead and his cult as a consummation of&nbsp;ancestor-worship, but a more probable explanation regards&nbsp;him as one of the Lares </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.; numina</span><span class="font0"> of the fields worshipped at the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">compita,</span><span class="font0"> the places where properties marched) who nad special&nbsp;charge of the house or possibly of the household servants </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(familia);&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">for it is significant that his worship was committed to the charge&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vilica.</span><span class="font0"> The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Genius</span><span class="font0"> is originally the &quot; spirit of developed&nbsp;manhood,” the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">numen</span><span class="font0"> which is attached to every man and represents&nbsp;the sum total of his powers and faculties as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Juno</span><span class="font0"> does of the&nbsp;woman: each individual worships his own </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Genius</span><span class="font0"> on his birthday,&nbsp;but the household-cult is concerned with the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Genius</span><span class="font0"> of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias.</span><span class="font0"> The established worship of the household then represents the various members of the family and the central points&nbsp;of the domestic activity; but we find also in the ordinary&nbsp;religious life of the family a more direct connexion with morality&nbsp;and a greater religious sense than in any other part, of the&nbsp;Roman cult. The family meal is sanctified by the offering of a&nbsp;portion of the food to the household wttrttma: the chief events&nbsp;in the individual life, birth, infancy, puberty, marriage, are all&nbsp;marked by religious ceremonial, in some cases of a distinctively-primitive character. The dead, too, though it is doubtful whether&nbsp;in early times they were actually worshipped,, at any rate have&nbsp;a religious commemoration as in some sense still members of the&nbsp;family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The next stage in the logical development of the state religion should naturally be found in the worship of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gens,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the aggregate of households belonging to one clan,&nbsp;but our information about the gentile worship is so&nbsp;scanty and uncertain <sup>@@2</sup> that we cannot make practical&nbsp;use of it. It is more profitable to turn from the life of the&nbsp;household to the outdoor occupations of the fields, where&nbsp;the early Roman settler met with his neighbours to celebrate the&nbsp;various stages of the agricultural year in religious ceremonies&nbsp;which afterwards became the festivals of the state calendar.&nbsp;Here we have a series of celebrations representing the occupations of the successive seasons, addressed sometimes to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mimina&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">who developed later on into the great gods of the state, such&nbsp;as Jupiter, Mars or Ceres, sometimes to vaguer divinities who&nbsp;remained always indefinite and rustic in character, such as&nbsp;Pales and Consus. Sometimes again, as in the case of the&nbsp;Lupercalia </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font0"> the attribution is so indefinite that it is hard&nbsp;to discover who was the special deity concerned; in other&nbsp;cases, such as those of the Robigalia and the Meditrinalia,&nbsp;the festival seems at first to have been addressed generally&nbsp;to any interested </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">numina</span><span class="font0"> and only later to have developed an&nbsp;eponymous deity of its own. Roughly we may distinguish&nbsp;three main divisions of the calendar year, the festivals of Spring,&nbsp;of the Harvest and of Winter, preserving on the whole their&nbsp;peculiar characteristics. (1) In the Spring (it must be remembered that the old Roman calendar began the year with March)&nbsp;we have ceremonials of anticipation and prayer for the crops&nbsp;to come: prominent among them are the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fordicidta,</span><span class="font0"> with its&nbsp;symbolic slaughter of pregnant cows, addressed to Tellus, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cerealia,</span><span class="font0"> a prayer-service to Ceres for the corn-crop, and the&nbsp;most important of the rustic celebrations of lustration and&nbsp;propitiation, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Parilia,</span><span class="font0"> the festival of Pales. To these&nbsp;must be added the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ambarvalia (q.v.),</span><span class="font0"> the lustration of the&nbsp;fields, a movable feast (and therefore not found in the calendars)&nbsp;addressed at first to Mars in his original agricultural character&nbsp;(see Mars). (2) Of the Harvest festivals the most significant&nbsp;are the twin celebrations on August 21st and 25th to the divinity-pair Consus and Ops, who are both concerned with the storing&nbsp;of the year’s produce, and two mysterious vintage festivals,&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vinalia Rustica</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Medilrinalia,</span><span class="font0"> connected originally with Jupiter. (3) The Winter festivals arc less homogeneous in character, but we may distinguish among&nbsp;them certain undoubtedly agricultural celebrations, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Saturnalia</span><span class="font0"> (at first connected with the sowing of the next&nbsp;year’s crop, but afterwards overlaid with Greek ceremonial),&nbsp;and a curious repetition of the harvest festivals to Consus&nbsp;and Ops.</span></p>
