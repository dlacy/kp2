<p><span class="font1">water delivered was about one-ſixth of the quantity which he promiſed, and about one-eleventh of the quantity which the no leſs celebrated M'Laurin calculated&nbsp;from the ſame plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Such being the ſtate of our theoretical knowledge (if it can be called by this name), naturaliſts began&nbsp;to be perſuaded that it was but loſing time to make&nbsp;any uſe of a theory ſo incongruous with obſerva-tion, and that the only ſafe method of proceeding was&nbsp;to multiply experiments in every variety of circum-ſtances, and to make a ſeries of experiments in every&nbsp;important caſe, which ſhould comprehend all the practicable modifications of that caſe. Perhaps circum-ſtances of reſemblance might occur, which would enable&nbsp;us to connect many of them together, and at laſt diſ-cover the principles which occaſioned this connection;&nbsp;by which means a theory founded on ſcience might be&nbsp;obtained. And if this point ſhould not be gained, we&nbsp;might perhaps find a few general facts, which are modified in all theſe particular caſes, in ſuch a manner that&nbsp;we can ſtill trace the general facts, and ſee the part of the&nbsp;particular caſe which depends on it. This would be the&nbsp;acquiſition of what may be called an empirical theory, by&nbsp;which every phenomenon would be explained, in ſo far&nbsp;as the explanation of a phenomenon is nothing more than&nbsp;the pointing out the general fact or law under which it&nbsp;is comprehended; and this theory would anſwer every&nbsp;practical purpoſe, becauſe we ſhould confidently forefee&nbsp;what conſequences would reſult from ſuch and ſuch&nbsp;premiſes; or if we ſhould fail even in this, we ſhould&nbsp;ſtill have a ſeries of experiments ſo comprehenſive, that&nbsp;we could tell what place in the ſeries would correſpond&nbsp;to any particular caſe which might be propoſed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are two gentlemen, whoſe labours in this re-ſpect deſerve very particular notice, profeſſor Miche-lotti at Turin, and Abbe Boſſut at Paris. The firſt made a prodigious number of experiments both on the&nbsp;motion of water through pipes and in open canals.&nbsp;They were performed at the expence of the ſovereign,&nbsp;and no expence was ſpared. A tower was built of the&nbsp;fineſt maſonry, to ſerve as a veſſel from which the water was to iſſue through holes of various ſizes, under&nbsp;preſſures from 5 to 22 feet. The water was received&nbsp;into baſons conſtructed of maſonry and nicely lined with&nbsp;ſtucco, from whence it was conveyed in canals of brickwork lined with ſtucco, and of various forms and declivities. The experiments on the expence of water&nbsp;through pipes are of all that have yet been made the&nbsp;moſt numerous and exact, and may be appealed to on&nbsp;every occaſion. Thoſe made in open canals are ſtill&nbsp;more numerous, and are no doubt equally accurate;&nbsp;but they have not been ſo contrived as to be ſo generally uſeful, being in general very unlike the important&nbsp;caſes which will occur in practice, and they ſeem to&nbsp;have been contrived chiefly with the view of eſtabliih-ing or overturning certain points of hydraulic doctrine&nbsp;which were probably prevalent at the time among the&nbsp;practical hydrauliſts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The experiments of Boſſut are alſo of both kinds; and though on a much ſmaller ſcale than thoſe of Mi-chelotti, ſeem to deſerve equal confidence. As far as&nbsp;they follow the ſame track, they perfectly coincide in&nbsp;their results, which ſhould procure confidence in the&nbsp;other; and they are made in ſituations much more&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">analogous to the uſual practical eaſts. This makes</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">them doubly valuable, They are</span><span class="font2"> to be found in his </span><span class="font1">two volumes intitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hydrodynamique.</span><span class="font1"> He has opened&nbsp;this path of procedure in </span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font1">manner ſo new and ſo judicious, that he has in ſome meaſure the merit of ſuch&nbsp;as ſhall follow him in the ſame path.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This has been moſt candidly and liberally allowed him by the chevalier de Buat, who has taken up this&nbsp;matter where the Abbé Boſſut left it, and has proſe-cuted his experiments with great aſſiduity; and we&nbsp;muſt now add with ſingular ſucceſs. By a very judicious conſideration of the ſubject, he hit on a particular view of it, which ſaved him the trouble of a minute conſideration of the ſmall internal motions, and&nbsp;enabled him to proceed from a very general and evident&nbsp;propoſition, which may be received as the key to a complete ſyſtem of practical hydraulics. We ſhall follow this&nbsp;ingenious author in what we have farther to ſay on the&nbsp;ſubject; and we doubt not but that our readers will think&nbsp;we do a ſervice to the public by making theſe diſcuſ-ſions of the chevalier de Buat more generally known&nbsp;in this country. It muſt not however be expected that&nbsp;we ſhall give more than a ſynoptical view of them,&nbsp;connected by ſuch familiar reaſoning as ſhall be either&nbsp;comprehended or confided in by perſons not deeply&nbsp;verſed in mathematical ſcience.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h3><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sect.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> I. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Theory of Rivers.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">It is certain that the motion of open ſtreams muſt, in ſome reſpects, reſemble that of bodies ſliding down&nbsp;inclined planes perfectly poliſhed; and that they would&nbsp;accelerate continually, were they not obſtructed: but&nbsp;they are obſtructed, and frequently move uniformly.&nbsp;This can only ariſe ſrom an equilibrium between the&nbsp;forces which promote their deſcent and thoſe which&nbsp;oppoſe it. Mr Buat, therefore, aſſumes the leading&nbsp;propoſition, that</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">When water flows uniformly on any channel or bed, the accelerating force which obliges it to move is equal to the&nbsp;ſum of all the reſiſtances which it meets with, whether ari-ſing from its own viſcidity, or from the friction of its bed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This law is as old as the formation of rivers, and ſhould be the key of hydraulic ſcience. Its evidence&nbsp;is clear; and it is, at any rate, the bails </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">all uniform&nbsp;motion. And ſince it is ſo, there muſt be ſome con-ſiderable analogy between the motion in pipes and in&nbsp;open channels. Both owe their origin to an inequa∙&nbsp;of preſſure; both would accelerate continually, if nothing&nbsp;hindered; and both are reduced to uniformity by the&nbsp;viſcidity of the fluid and the friction of the channel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It will therefore be convenient to examine the phenomena of water moving in pipes by the action of its weight only along the ſloping channel. But previous&nbsp;to this, we muſt take ſome notice of the obſtruction&nbsp;to the entry of water into a channel of any kind, ariſing. from the deflection of the many different filaments&nbsp;which preſs into the channel from the reſervoir from every&nbsp;ſide. Then we ſhall be able to ſeparate this diminution of motion ſrom the ſum total that is obſerved,&nbsp;and aſcertain what part remains as produced by the&nbsp;ſubſequent obſtructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We then ſhall conſider the principle of uniform motion, the equilibrium between the power and the re-ſiſtance. The power is the relative height of the column of fluid which tends to move along the in-dined plane of its bed; the re</span><span class="font1">ſiſt</span><span class="font2">ance is the friction</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
