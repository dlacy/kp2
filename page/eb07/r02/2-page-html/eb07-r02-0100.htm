<p><span class="font1">the chief interest connected with these novelists consists 'in the hints or materials furnished by them to Shakspeare,&nbsp;Massinger, Beaumont and Fletcher, and our dramatic writers of the time of Elizabeth and James, to whom indeed&nbsp;these works, particularly those of Bandello, afforded a perfect storehouse for plots. Among the nine volumes of Ban-dello’s works contained in the Novelliero, some interesting&nbsp;and a few pathetic tales may be pointed out ; but Cintio’s&nbsp;can have no interest in themselves except for those who&nbsp;love to sup full of horrors ; for he was one of those wholesale dealers in the terrible, who thought that poetical effect was to be produced by a vigorous operation on the&nbsp;nerves rather than the feelings, and therefore piqued himself, like the schoolmaster in Gil Blas, on massacring all the&nbsp;personages of his tragedies, even to the prompter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Towards the close of the last century, a taste for novels in a style somewhat resembling our own, appears to have&nbsp;gained ground, and several tales of a melancholy kind made&nbsp;their appearance. With these we do not profess to be acquainted ; nor has any one which appeared prior to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Promessi Sposi&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">ofManzoni, attained the least reputation beyond Italy, with the&nbsp;exception of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ultime Lettere di Jacopo Ortis,</span><span class="font1"> an early&nbsp;production of Ugo Foscolo, (1802) ; and the result partly of&nbsp;a melancholy event occurring in his own family, and partly of the study of Goethe’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Werther,</span><span class="font1"> by which the enthusiastic mind of Foscolo appears to have been very powerfully affected. Like </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Werther,</span><span class="font1"> it is a story of love and&nbsp;suicide, full of fervour, violence, and, to speak the truth,&nbsp;of absurdity ; yet delivered with a species of eloquence, and&nbsp;a certain appearance of conviction, which, so far at least as&nbsp;regarded the expression of mental discomfort, and the misery&nbsp;arising from a total want of all fixed opinion, was perhaps&nbsp;sufficiently real. To the Italians, who knew little or nothing of Goethe, this stormy effervescence of an impassioned temperament, and all this eloquent “ questioning of fate,”&nbsp;possessed even an air of originality; and being the first successful attempt to introduce the sentimental romance of the&nbsp;school of Rousseau and Goethe into Italy, it naturally&nbsp;awakened a degree of enthusiasm which now appears somewhat disproportioned to its real merit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Promessi Sposi</span><span class="font1"> of Manzoni certainly approaches much more nearly to the idea of a good romance than any&nbsp;thing which Italy has yet produced ; but, after all, it too is&nbsp;essentially an imitation. If we had had no Scott, we should&nbsp;have had no Manzoni. The idea of illustrating a subject&nbsp;connected with the Italian history of the commencement of&nbsp;the seventeenth century ; the introduction of historical characters, such as that of Cardinal Borromeo, who is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">deus&nbsp;ex machina</span><span class="font1"> of the piece ; the antiquarian lore displayed in&nbsp;the way in which the bread-riot in Milan (a close parallel&nbsp;to the insurrection of the Liegeois in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Quentin Durward),</span><span class="font1"> is&nbsp;wrought up ; the account of the plague in tlle Milanese,&nbsp;in which Manzoni has tried to imitate at once Boccacio and&nbsp;Scott,—all concur to satisfy us, that Manzoni, though an able&nbsp;lyric poet, has no great share of original invention, and that&nbsp;though he can make a good use of materials furnished by&nbsp;others, he is one of those literary commercialists who require to borrow the main portion of the capital with which&nbsp;they are to trade. We are far, however, from denying&nbsp;the real merits of this performance of Manzoni, in which&nbsp;the characters of Cardinal Borromeo, and the peasant hero&nbsp;and heroine, Renzo and Lucia, are naturally and pleasingly&nbsp;drawn, and in which some of the scenes, such as the opening scene at Don Abbondio’s house, the riot in Milan, the&nbsp;interview between the unknown and the Cardinal, and some&nbsp;of the incidents and descriptions connected with the plague,&nbsp;are of vivid interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Since the appearance of the romance of Manzoni, who has lately abandoned both fiction and poetry for religion, many&nbsp;attempts have been made by Rosini, D’Azeglio, Guerazzi,&nbsp;Tommaseo, Belmonte, and others, to transfer the historical</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">romance to an Italian soil, and to give a romantic interest to the delineation of the Italian feudal history of the middle&nbsp;ages, or of periods somewhat later. The first, and we believe the best, of these appears to be the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Monaca de Monza&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of Rosini, who has founded his story on an episode in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Promessi Sposi.</span><span class="font1"> Were we to form a judgment from a&nbsp;few of these attempts which we have read, as to the merits&nbsp;of those of which we remain ignorant, we should be inclined to say generally, that nothing is more remarkable&nbsp;than the total want of interest which Italian subjects possess in Italian hands ; a result which appears the more&nbsp;singular, since at one time it was only necessary in our&nbsp;English romances to transfer the scene to Italy, to enlist at once our warmest sympathies in favour of the story.&nbsp;Now-a-days, we think, when the subject is almost entirely&nbsp;in the hands of native novel-writers, the very idea of embarking on an Italian story of the middle ages, seems to act&nbsp;upon the fancy as the most powerfid refrigerative. Strangely enough, too, it is to be observed, that the Italian novelistβ&nbsp;of modern times never appear to greater advantage than in&nbsp;the description of the most furious battles, carried on with&nbsp;all the determination and bloody-mindedness of an Esplan-dian or a Bobadil, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ettοre Fieramosca,</span><span class="font1"> by Massimo&nbsp;D’Azeglio, a son-in-law ofManzoni, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">οτEAssεdiο di Firenze,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">by Gualandi ; an expenditure of valour on paper which we&nbsp;fear is scarcely justified by the fact, since, if we are to give&nbsp;credit to the accounts of Guacciardini, many of their most&nbsp;doughty encounters were as harmless in their results as the&nbsp;protracted passage of arms between Gymnast and Tripet,&nbsp;in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rabelais,</span><span class="font1"> as to which uncle Toby, after listening to an&nbsp;endless detail of the various complicated manœuvres, declared, that one home-thrust of the bayonet would have been&nbsp;worth them all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Spain, which, though not the birth-place, had certainly become by adoption pre-eminently the country of the chivalrous romance, and where, perhaps, its extravagances had been less redeemed by talent than any where&nbsp;else, it is well known that a revolution in taste was effected&nbsp;by the inimitable satire of Cervantes, (1547-1616), which&nbsp;Montesquieu, with amusing extravagance, describes as the&nbsp;single admirable book in the Spanish language which shews&nbsp;the absurdity of all the rest. So effectually, indeed, did&nbsp;that work (published in 1605) attain its end, or rather one&nbsp;of its ends, that after its appearance no romance of chivalry&nbsp;appeared in Spain, and the old ones so entirely ceased to be&nbsp;printed, that it is with difficulty that copies of them are now&nbsp;to be obtained. The “ ultimus Romanorum,” the last adherent of the good old romance, was Don Juan de Silva y&nbsp;Toledo, who published his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Don Policisne de Boecia</span><span class="font1"> in 1602,&nbsp;three years before the appearance of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Don Quixote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But, had that book been solely devoted to the object of exploding the old romances of chivalry, it would probably&nbsp;have shortly been forgotten with the extravagances it exposed. The charm which has given a perennial life and&nbsp;continued popularity to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Don Quixote,</span><span class="font1"> is the deeper idea&nbsp;w hich it contains of illustrating, in comic colours, the contest between imagination and reality ; the danger, both to&nbsp;its possessor and to others, of all misdirected enthusiasm,&nbsp;whether it take the direction of reviving an extinct age&nbsp;of chivalry, or any other course plainly running counter to&nbsp;the current of society all around it, by means of which a&nbsp;constant collision is produced, in which, whatever becomes&nbsp;of the world, the visionary himself is sure to be the sufferer.&nbsp;For the fuller development of this idea, he has placed beside the knight, who represents the imagination without&nbsp;the common sense, a squire who is the type of the vulgar&nbsp;common sense without the imagination. Between these&nbsp;children of his brain, he parcels out </span><span class="font0">tlle </span><span class="font1">treasures of his&nbsp;mind, bequeathing to the knight his own high spirit and&nbsp;courage, his learning, his generosity, and his love of truth ;</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
