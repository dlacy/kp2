(Thomas), deſcended of an ancient family in Staffordſhire, was born in 1640, and educated at Caius college, Cambridge, He then was placed in the Middle Temple to ſtudy the laws ; where having ſpent ſome time, he travelled abroad. Upon his return home, he became acquainted with the moſt celebrated perlons of wit in that age, He applied himſelf chiefly to dramatic writing, in which he had great ſucceſs ; and upon the Revolution was made poet-laureat and hiſtoriographer to king William and queen Mary, in the room of Mr. Dryden. Theſe employments he enjoyed till his death, which happened in 1692. Beſide his dramatic writings, he compoſed ſeveral other pieces of poetry; the chief of which are his congratulatory poem on the prince of Orange’s coming to England ; another on queen Mary; his tranſlation of Juvenal’s 10th ſatire, &amp; c. Mr Dryden treats him with great contempt, in his ſatire called <hi rend="italic">Mac-Fleckno.</hi> The beſt judges of that age, however, gave their teſtimony in favour of his comedies ; which have in them fine ſtrokes of humour ; the characters are often original, ſtrongly marked, and well ſuſtained, An edition of his works, with ſome account of his life and writings prefixed, was publiſhed in 1720, in 4 vols 8vo,</p></div></body></text></TEI>
