Every thing in fiction, in short, looked unpromising and exhausted. The appearance of a great writer, wno should strike out a new path through this much trodden waste, seemed at that moment in the highest degree improbable. And yet this was at once effected by the Author of Waver-ley, in such a manner as to raise the romance from the lowest level to the very highest position in literature.</p><p>Nothing, we believe, could be more irksome or more useless than to enter on any formal criticism of the romances of Scott ; and it may well be doubted whether the present generation be in a condition to judge of his merits with perfect impartiality, or to determine his precise rank as a writer of fiction. We at least shall not allow ourselves to be seduced into such a disquisition, but shall confine our observations to a few points on which we think it hardly probable that posterity will reverse the concurrent judgment of the present day.</p><p>The resemblance of Scott’s mind to that of Shakspeare has been often remarked, and with some justice ; for though even the most enthusiastic admirers ofthe romance writer, will hardly venture to claim for him an equality of powers with Shakspeare, there were strong kindred features in the character of their minds. In both we are struck with the same general and almost universal sympathies, leading to impartial and kindly views of all men and all opinions, the most remote from their own ; a cheerful, healthful tone of feel-mg, which brightens existence about us, instead of dwelling on its evils ; an avoidance of all moral casuistry, or treading on the borders of the forbidden, either in tlle creation of characters or of incidents ; the feeling of the humourous as strongly developed as the sensibilities or the imagination ; great self-possession, and a noiseless exertion of power, working out its end, not by sudden bursts, or high-wrought passages, but by a silent and steady progression, like the dawn brightening into the fulness of day.</p><p>The works of Scott produce their effect rather by the combination of many qualities than the predominance of any. In depth of feeling, we think he yields to the author of <hi rend="italic">Anastasias;</hi>  in invention of incident, and disposition of plot, he is equalled by many ; his humour will hardly bear a comparison with that of Sterne, or the best parts of Fielding ; and in the direct and forcible expression of the stronger passions, we should be inclined to give the preference both to Godwin and the author of <hi rend="italic">Valentis.</hi>  But his strength lies in the possession and harmonious adjustment of most of the qualities requisite to the novelist, none engrossing the whole mind, none excluding another, but all working together in kindly unison : learning arrayed in the most picturesque combinations ; observation of fife embodied not in abstractions, but in living forms ; humour springing out of tenderness, like smiles struggling through tears; the spirit of ancient knighthood leavening the worldly wisdom of modern times; and the imagination of the poet adorning, without impairing the common sympathies and good-humoured sagacity of the man.</p><p>Thc department in which this combination of qualities has been most successfully displayed by Scott, was that of the historical romance,—a class of fictions which he may truly be said to have created. For although fictions bearing the title of historical romances, were by no means uncommon in English literature before the time of Scott, such as the <hi rend="italic">Recess</hi>  of Miss Lee, or the <hi rend="italic">Scottish Chiefs</hi>  of Miss Porter, it is apparent that they stand in a totally different class ; not being, in fact, historical, except in the names of the characters. Obvious as the idea now appears, Scott was in truth, the first to show how much invention might gain by a union with reality ; what additional probability, interest, and importance might be given to the fortunes of imagin-arv heroes, by interweaving their destinies with those of historical personages ; nay, how much of romance in its finest forms lies in the characters and events of history itself invisible to the prosaic or merely philosophic observer, but obvious at once to the eye of imagination. He has carried the picturesque of history to its perfection ; for without imparting to his portraits the deep and subtle traits by which Shakspeare so wonderfully individualizes the beings of his dramas, he never fails at least to present consistent and striking pictures of his historical personages in their habit as they lived, and to dispose the light and shadow about them with the most felicitous adjustment,—dress, look, gestures, manner, and the outward accompaniments of scenery, being all made important accessories, to heighten the effect of well-known peculiarities, or to hide the want of those over which Time has dropped a veil, which even Imagination can hardly raise.</p><p>In description, indeed, generally, Sir Walter Scott was unrivalled. Whatever he sees with the eye of the mind, shapes itself into words which enable us to see it too. His pictures combine in a singular way breadth and minuteness ; for while he painted the details with sharpness and firmness, no one understood better the art of arrangement in masses ; so that he never fails to give the spirit as well as the form of the spot, making us <hi rend="italic">feel</hi>  the solemnity and gloom of castles and druidical forests, the calm produced by the still beauty of a Highland lake, from which the morning mist is disappearing, or the healthy elevation of spirits with which we travel up some mountain height, whence we see far into the country beyond, and “ feel the breath of heaven fresh blowing.”</p><p>We offer no remarks upon his characters, except this, that making every allowance for repetitions, no writer of fiction since Shakespeare has enriched the portrait gallery of invention with more originals, of which we have a distinct conception ; and that though his female characters have less variety and less truth than his male personages, we know no writer except Shakspeare to whom tile same remark may not justly be applied.</p><p>The plots of Scott, speaking generally, are neither remarkable for excellence, nor the reverse. Examples may, in fact, be found, in the long list of his romances, both of skilful and defective plots. <hi rend="italic">Ivanhoe, Kenilworth,</hi>  and the <hi rend="italic">Bride of Lamermoor,</hi>  for instance, are proofs how artfully he could at times arrange his plan ; the two latter having all the compactness and steady progression of tile drama. Others, again, such as <hi rend="italic">The Monastery, St. Ronan's Well, </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Rob Roy, axe</hi>  in a high degree loose and inconsequential.</p><p>Fertile and inventive as was the genius of Scott, it cannot, we think, be denied, that during the latter half of his career as a writer of fiction, he appeared to less advantage. No wonder, indeed, when, in addition to tile limits by which all invention is bounded, we consider under what depressing circumstances many of his later works were composed, tllat in these even the elasticity of genius itself should be somewhat outworn and deadened ; that the conventional, both in character and incident, should occasionally supply the place of invention ; and that mere imagery, and not always very appropriate illustration, should be substituted for the natural turns which at first enlivened the dialogue. “If there be a mental drudgery,” to use his own words in his notice of Charlotte Smith, “which lowers the spirits and lacerates the nerves like the toil of the slave, it is that which is exacted by literary composition, when the heart is not in unison with the work on which the head is employed.” When he breaks up new ground, as in <hi rend="italic">Nigel, Quentin Duneard, </hi>and <hi rend="italic">The Crusaders,</hi>  his genius indeed suffers little diminution ; but in <hi rend="italic">Redgauntlet, Anne of Gierstein,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">The Betrothed,</hi>  the practised skill of the mechanist, recomposing old materials in new shapes, is far more visible than the freshness and spontaniety of an original inspiration. With the publication of <hi rend="italic">Kenilworth,</hi>  indeed, tile sun of his fame may be said to have “ touched the highest point of all its great</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
