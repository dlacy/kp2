<p><label>RETIREMENT</label>
means a private way of life, or a secret habitation. “ Few,” says an elegant writer, “ are able to bear solitude ; and though retirement is the ostensible object of the greater part, yet, when they are enabled by success to retire, they feel themselves unhappy. Peculiar powers and elegance of mind are necessary to enable us to draw all our resources from ourselves. In a remote and solitary village the mind must be internally active in a great degree, or it will be miserable for want of employment. But in great and populous cities, even while it is passive, it will be constantly amused. It is impossible to walk the streets without finding the attention powerfully solicited on every side. No exertion is necessary. Objects pour themselves into the senses, and it would be difficult to prevent their admittance. But, in retirement, there must be a spirit of philosophy and a store of learning, or else the fancied scenes of bliss will vanish like the colours of the rainbow. Poor Cowley might be said to be melancholy mad. He languished for solitude, and wished to hide himself in the wilds of America. But he was not able to support the solitude of a country village within a few miles of the metropolis. With a virtuous and cheerful family, with a few faithful and good-humoured friends, with a well-selected collection of elegant books, and with a competency, one may enjoy comforts even in the deserted village, which the city, with all its diversions, cannot supply.”</p>
