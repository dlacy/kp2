<p><span class="font0">to appear orbicular, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A. orbicularis,</span><span class="font0"> a South American reptile, which, from its thickened form and broadened head,&nbsp;seems at first sight a connecting link between the frogs and&nbsp;lizards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The genus Trapelus, Cuv., has the teeth and general form of Agama, but the scales are small and spineless. There&nbsp;are no pores on the thighs. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">T. Egyptius,</span><span class="font0"> Geoff., is a small&nbsp;species, in which the body is sometimes inflated. It can&nbsp;change its colour even more rapidly than the chameleon.&nbsp;This genus is not easily distinguished from some thick and&nbsp;slightly spined species of Agama, to which indeed the genera </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Leiolepis, Tropidolepis,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Leposoma,</span><span class="font0"> are nearly allied,&nbsp;and for the descriptive characters of which we may refer&nbsp;the reader to systematic works. The genus Calotes, Cuv.,&nbsp;differs from Agama in being regularly covered with scales&nbsp;disposed tile-ways, often keeled and pointed, as well on the&nbsp;body as on the limbs, and tail, which is of great length.&nbsp;The scales on the middle of the back are more or less raised and compressed, forming a crest or ridge of variable extent. There are neither wattles nor pores upon the thighs,&nbsp;—characters which sufficiently distinguish them from the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Iguanas proper.</span><span class="font0"> The best-known species is that called&nbsp;the galeot lizard (Z. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">calotes,</span><span class="font0"> Linn.), of a variable colour,&nbsp;but usually of a fine light blue, with transverse lines of&nbsp;white upon the sides. There are two rows of spines behind&nbsp;the ear, and a lengthened ridge along the back. Its eggs&nbsp;are fusiform, or spindle-shaped. This curious reptile is&nbsp;native to the East Indies, and is called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">chameleon</span><span class="font0"> in the Moluccas, though it scarcely changes its colour. It is said to&nbsp;wander about upon the roofs of houses in quest of spiders ;&nbsp;and Lacépède observes that it is reported to prey even on&nbsp;rats, and to fight with serpents. When out of temper, its&nbsp;throat becomes so inflated as to give it a frightful aspect.&nbsp;If authors are correct, its distribution must be very extensive, as it is said to occur not only in the East Indies, but&nbsp;in Arabia and Barbary. It certainly, however, does not inhabit Spain, as some have said. In the genus Lophyrus,&nbsp;Dumeril, the scales of the body resemble those of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Agama,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and the palisade-like ridge upon the back is even higher&nbsp;than in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Calotes.</span><span class="font0"> The tail is compressed. To this genus&nbsp;belongs </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Agarna gigantea</span><span class="font0"> of Khul, remarkable for the height&nbsp;of its crest above the neck. Two bony ridges continued&nbsp;from the muzzle terminate in a point on each side above&nbsp;the eye, and join upon the temples. It is a nati ve of India.&nbsp;In Lyriocephalus, Merrem, we find a species in which&nbsp;the bony crest above the eyes is even more marked than in&nbsp;the preceding, and terminates behind on each side in a sharp&nbsp;point. This strange reptile is found in Bengid and other&nbsp;parts of the East, and is said to live on grain. See Plate&nbsp;CCCCXXXL fig. 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The preceding generic groups, from Agama downwards, are all more or less allied to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Agarnœ</span><span class="font0"> of Daudin. We&nbsp;now proceed to a brief consideration of certain genera, of&nbsp;which the relationship is more remote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The genus Istiurus of Cuvier is distinguished by an elevated cutting crest, which extends to a portion of the&nbsp;tail, and is supported by the high spinal processes of the&nbsp;vertebræ. This crest is scaly like the rest of the body,&nbsp;and the scales of the abdomen and tail are small, and rather&nbsp;of a square form. There are no teeth on the palate, but&nbsp;those of the other parts of the mouth are strong, compressed, and without dentation. The thighs bear a row of pores.&nbsp;The skin of the throat is loose, but does not form a dewlap. To this genus belongs that very remarkable animal&nbsp;the Amboyna lizard </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(L. Amboinensis,</span><span class="font0"> Gm.), first described&nbsp;by Valentyn, and afterwards with great accuracy and an&nbsp;excellent figure by Dr Albert Schlosser in 1768. The&nbsp;back is spined, but the regular ridge only commences at&nbsp;the base of the tail, over a portion of which it extends, like&nbsp;a broad upright fin. The head and neck are green, varied by transverse whitish undulations ; the back and tail&nbsp;are brown, with a slight cast of blue or purple ; and the&nbsp;sides and abdomen are grayish, spotted by means of round&nbsp;white scales. It resides, according to Valentyn, in the&nbsp;vicinity of fresh waters, and is frequently observed on the&nbsp;banks of rising grounds as well as on the lowlier kinds of&nbsp;shrubs which vegetate near the water, but does not ascend&nbsp;the taller trees. When disturbed by the approach of man&nbsp;or beast, it instantly dives, and hides itself among the rocks&nbsp;or stones beneath the banks. When captured, it does not in&nbsp;any way defend itself, but seems stupified. It may be caught&nbsp;by a noose or snare, and its flesh is said to be white and&nbsp;sweet, although of a penetrating odour. It is highly esteemed&nbsp;as food by many, and is itself accustomed to prey both on&nbsp;insects and vegetable substances. It sometimes attains a&nbsp;length of nearly four feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The genus Draco, Linn., may be distinguished at a glance from all other Saurian reptiles, by the singular peculiarity of six false ribs, which, instead of conforming as usual&nbsp;to the shape of the body, extend from it at right angles,&nbsp;and supporting a produced portion of the skin, present the&nbsp;appearance of a pair of wings. They support the animal in&nbsp;the air, as it leaps from branch to branch, but have no propelling power, and so cannot raise it in the least degree.&nbsp;In relation to their other characters, these so-called dragons&nbsp;are of small size, and covered all over by imbricated scales,&nbsp;of which those on the tail and limbs are keeled. The tongue&nbsp;is fleshy, not very extensile, and slightly notched. Beneath the throat there is a long pointed dewlap, supported&nbsp;by the tail of the hyoid bone ; and on its sides are two&nbsp;others of smaller size, sustained by the horns of the same&nbsp;bone. The tail is long ; there is a small dentation on tile&nbsp;nape of the neck ; and the thighs have no pores. Each jaw&nbsp;is furnished with four small incisor teeth, with a pair of&nbsp;long-pointed canines, and twelve triangular three-lobed&nbsp;grinders. The genus may be said to combine the scales&nbsp;and dewlaps of the Iguanas, with the head and teeth of the&nbsp;Stellions. See Plate CCCCXXXI. fig. 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All the known species of Draco inhabit the East Indies, and have derived their generic appellation from their supposed resemblance to the fictitious Dragons of antiquity.&nbsp;In all ages, and in most countries, the imagination of timid&nbsp;or fantastic men has produced a belief in the existence of&nbsp;fabulous beings, of monstrous forms and irresistible ferocity, which carried devastation into provinces, guarded the&nbsp;entrance to sacred places, or watched over “ sunless heaps”&nbsp;of hidden gold. The heroic history of Greece, and the&nbsp;darker superstitions of the Germanic people, are alike pervaded by these fond beliefs. “ Rendered celebrated,” says&nbsp;Lacépède, “ by the songs of Greece and Rome, the principal ornament of pious fables imagined in more recent&nbsp;times, conquered by heroes, and even by youthful heroines,&nbsp;who were contending for a divine law, and adopted by a&nbsp;second mythology, which placed the fairies on the throne of&nbsp;the enchantress of old, the Dragon became the emblem of&nbsp;the splendid actions of valiant knights, and has enlivened&nbsp;modem as it animated ancient poetry. Proclaimed by the&nbsp;severe voice of history, everywhere described, everywhere&nbsp;celebrated, everywhere dreaded ; exhibited under all forms,&nbsp;always clothed with tremendous power, and immolating his&nbsp;victims by a single glance ; transporting himself through&nbsp;the midst of clouds with the rapidity of lightning, dissipating the darkness of night by the terrific splendour of&nbsp;his glaring eyes, uniting the agility of the eagle, the strength&nbsp;of the lion, and the magnitude of the giant serpent ; sometimes presented under a human figure, endowed with an&nbsp;intelligence almost divine, and adored, even in our own&nbsp;days, in the great empires of the East,—the Dragon, in&nbsp;short, has been all in all, and everywhere to be found, except in nature.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The existence of these animals has not been altogether discredited, even in modern times. About the middle of</span></p>
