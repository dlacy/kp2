the name oſ an inſtrument uſed for finding the bigneſs of fine round pearls. It conſiſts of thin pieces or leaves, about two inches long, and half an inch broad, faſtened together at one end by a rivet. In each of theſe are round holes drilled oſ different diameters. Thoſe in the firſt leaf ſerve for meaſuring pearls from half a grain to ſeven grains ; thoſe of the ſecond, for pearls from eight grains or two carats to five carats, &amp; c. ; and thoſe of the third, for pearls from six carats and a half to eight carats and a half.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Size,</hi> is also a sort of paint, varniſh, or glue, uſed by painters, &amp; c</p><p>The shreds and parings of leather, parchment, or vellum, being boiled in water and ſtrained, make ſize. This ſubſtance is much uſed in many trades. — The manner of using ſize is to melt ſome of it over a gentle fire ; and ſcraping as much whiting into it as will just colour it, let them be well incorporated together ; after which you may whiten frames, &amp; c. with it. After it dries, melt the ſize again, and put more whiting, and whiten the frames, &amp; c. ſeven or eight times, letting it dry between each time: but before it is quite dry, between each waffling with ſize, you muſt ſmoothe and wet it over with a clean bruſh-pencil in fair water.</p><p>To make gold-size. Take gum-animi and aſphaltum, of each one ounce ; minium, litharge of gold, and amber, of each half an ounce : reduce all into a very fine powder, and add to them four ounces of linſeed-oil, and eight ounces of drying oil : digeſt them over a gentle fire that does not flame, ſo that the mixture may only ſimmer, but not boil ; left it ſhould run over and ſet the houſe on fire, ſtir it constantly with a ſtick till all the ingredients are diſſolved and incorporated, and do not leave off ſtirring till it becomes thick and ropy ; after being ſufficiently boiled, let it ſtand till it is almoſt cold, and then strain it through a coarſe linen cloth, and keep it for uſe.—To prepare it for working, put what quantity you pleaſe in a horſe-muſcle ſhell, adding as much oil of turpentine as will diſſolve it ; and making it as thin as the bottom of your ſeed-lac varniſh, hold it over a candle, and then ſtrain it through a linen-rag into another ſhell ; add to theſe as much vermilion as will make</p><p>it of a darkiſh red : if it is too thick for drawing, you may thin it with ſome oil of turpentine. The chief uſe of this ſize is for laying on metals.</p><p>The beſt gold-ſize for burniſhing is made as follows: Take fine bole, what quantity you pleaſe ; grind it finely on a piece of marble, then ſcrape into it a little beef ſuet ; grind all well together ; after which mix is a ſmall proportion of parchment-size with a double proportion of water, and it is done.</p><p>To make silver-size. Take tobacco-pipe clay in fine powder, into which ſcrape ſome black-lead and a little Genoa soap, and grind them all together with parchment ſize as already directed.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
