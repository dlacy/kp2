<p><span class="font1">been </span><span class="font0">highly pleaſing to Antony, as Hiparchus had left him to join the fortunes of his more ſucceſsful rival.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meanwhile, the operations of the war were carried vigorouſly forward, and Egypt was once more the&nbsp;theatre of the contending armies of Rome. Gallus,&nbsp;the lieutenant of Oéfavianus, took Paretonium, which&nbsp;opened the whole country to his incurſions. On the&nbsp;other ſide, Antony, who had ſtill conſiderable forces&nbsp;by ſea and land, wanted to take that important place&nbsp;from the enemy. He therefore marched towards it,&nbsp;flattering himſelf, that as ſoon as he ſhould ſhow himſelf to the legions which he had once commanded,&nbsp;their affection for their ancient general would revive.&nbsp;He approached, therefore, and exhorted them to remember their former vows of fidelity. Gallus, however, ordered all the trumpets to ſound, in order to&nbsp;hinder Antony from being heard, ſo that he was obliged to retire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Octavianus himſelf was in the mean time advancing with another army before Peluſium, which, by its&nbsp;ſtrong ſituation, might have retarded his progreſs for&nbsp;ſo ne time. But the governor of the city, either wanting courage to defend it, or previouſly inſtructed by&nbsp;Cleopatra to give it up, permitted him to take poſſeſſion of the place ; ſo that Octavianus had now no obſtacle in his way to Alexandria, whither he marched&nbsp;with all expedition. Antony, upon his arrival, ſallied&nbsp;out to oppoſe him, fighting with great deſperation,&nbsp;and putting the enemy’s cavalry to flight. This flight&nbsp;advantage once more revived his declining hopes ; and,&nbsp;being naturally vain, he re-entered Alexandria in triumph. Then going, all armed as he was, to the palace, he embraced Cleopatra, and preſented her a ſoldier&nbsp;who had diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the late engagement.&nbsp;The queen rewarded him very magnificently ; preſenting&nbsp;him with an head-piece and breaft~plate of gold. With&nbsp;theſe, however, the ſoldier went off the next night to&nbsp;the other army. /Antony could not bear this defection&nbsp;without freſh indignation ; he reſolved, therefore, to&nbsp;make a bold expiring effort by ſea and land, but previouſly offered to ſight his adverſary in ſingle combat.&nbsp;Octavianus too well knew the inequality of their ſituations to comply with this forlorn offer ; he only<sub>r</sub> therefore, coolly replied, that Antony had ways enough to&nbsp;die beſides ſingle combat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The evening before the day appointed for the laſt deſperate attempt, he ordered a grand entertainment to&nbsp;be prepared. At day-break he poſted the few troops&nbsp;he had remaining upon a riſing ground near the city :&nbsp;from whence he ſent orders to his galleys to engage the&nbsp;enemy. There he waited to be a ſpectator of the combat ; and, at firſt, he had the ſatisfaction to ſee them&nbsp;advance in good order ; but his approbation was ſoon&nbsp;turned into rage, when he ſaw his ſhips only ſaluting&nbsp;thoſe of Octavianus, and both fleets uniting together,&nbsp;and foiling back into the harbour. At the very ſame&nbsp;time his cavalry deſerted him. He tried, however, to&nbsp;lead on his infantry ; which were eaſily vanquiſhed, and&nbsp;he himſelf compelled to return into the town. His&nbsp;anger was now ungovernable ; he could not help crying&nbsp;out aloud as he paſſed, that he was betrayed by Cleopatra, and delivered by her to thoſe who, for her ſake&nbsp;alone, were his enemies. In theſe ſuſpicions he was&nbsp;not deceived ; for it was by ſecret orders from the queen&nbsp;that the fleet had paſſed over to the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Cleopatra had, ſor a long while, dreaded the effects of Antony’s jealouſy ; and had, ſome time before, prepared a method of obviating any ſudden follies it&nbsp;might produce. Near the temple of lſis ſhe had erected a building, which was ſeemingly deſigned for a&nbsp;ſepulchre. Hither ſhe removed all her treaſure and&nbsp;moſt valuable effects, covering them over with torches,&nbsp;faggots, and other combuſtible matter. This ſepulchre&nbsp;ſhe deſigned to anſwer a double purpoſe ; as well to&nbsp;ſcreen her from the ſudden reſentments of Antony, as&nbsp;to make Octavianus believe that ſhe would burn all her&nbsp;treaſures in caſe he refuſed her proper terms of capitulation. Here, therefore, ſhe retired from Antony’s&nbsp;preſent fury ; (hutting the gates, which were fortified&nbsp;with bolts and bars of iron : but in the mean time gave&nbsp;orders that a report ſhould be ſpread of her death.—&nbsp;This news, which ſoon reached Antony, recalled all&nbsp;his former love and tenderneſs. He now lamented her&nbsp;death with the ſame violence he had but a few minutes&nbsp;before ſeemed to deſire it ; and called one of his freed-men, named </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eros,</span><span class="font0"> whom he had engaged by oath to&nbsp;kill him whenever fortune ſhould drive him to this laſt&nbsp;reſource. Eros being now commanded to perform his&nbsp;promiſe, this faithful follower drew the ſword, as if&nbsp;going to execute hie orders ; but turning his face,&nbsp;plunged it into his own boſom, and died at his maſter’s&nbsp;feet. Antony for a while hung over his faithful ſer-vant, and, commending his fidelity, took up the ſword,&nbsp;with which ſtabbing himſelf in the belly, he fell backward upon a little couch. Though the wound was&nbsp;mortal, yet the blood ſtopping he recovered his ſpirits,&nbsp;and earneſtly conjured thoſe who were come into the&nbsp;room to put an end to his life ; but they all fled, being&nbsp;ſeized with fright and horror. He therefore continued&nbsp;in agonies for ſome time ; till he was informed by one&nbsp;of the queen’s ſecretaries that his miſtreſs was ſtill alive.&nbsp;He then earneſtly deſired to be carried to the place where&nbsp;ſhe was. They accordingly brought him to the gate of&nbsp;the ſepulchre ; but Cleopatra, who would not permit it&nbsp;to be opened, appeared at the window, and threw down&nbsp;cords in order to pull him up. In this manner, aſſiſted&nbsp;by her two female attendants, ſhe raiſed him all bloody&nbsp;from the ground ; and while yet fuſpended in the air,&nbsp;he continued ſtretching out his-hands to encourage her.&nbsp;Cleopotra and her maids had only juſt ſtrength ſufficient to raiſe him ; and at laſt, with much ſtraining, they&nbsp;effected their purpoſe, and carried him to a couch, on&nbsp;which they gently laid him. Here ſhe gave way to&nbsp;her ſorrow, tearing her clothes, beating her breaſt, and&nbsp;kiſſing the wound of which he was dying. She called&nbsp;upon him as her lord, her huſhand, her emperor, and&nbsp;ſeemed to have forgot her own diſtreſſes in the greatneſs&nbsp;of his ſufferings, Antony entreated her to moderate&nbsp;the tranſports of her grief, and allied for ſome wine.&nbsp;After he had drank, he entreated Cleopatra to endeavour&nbsp;to preſerve her life, if ſhe could do it with honour ; and&nbsp;recommended Proculus, a friend of Octavianus, as one&nbsp;ſhe might rely on to be her interceſſor. Juſt as he had&nbsp;done ſpeaking, he expired ; and Proculus made his appearance by command of Octavianus, who had been&nbsp;informed of Antony’s deſperate conduct. He was ſent&nbsp;to try all means of getting Cleopatra into his power ;&nbsp;his maſter having a double motive for his ſolicitude on&nbsp;this occaſion ; one, to prevent her deſtroying the treaſures ſhe had taken with her into the tomb j the other,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
