of keeping in repair the permanent way. The number of ' trips has also to be augmented by an average allowance for the above tonnage. For computing the expense of the way, we must likewise include the weight of the engines and tenders, say 15 tons each. We then have
Goods...........................751914
Engines 13014, at 15 tons... 195210
Total weight of goods’ trains    947124
Passengers, at 15 to a ton......62941
Luggage, at 28 lbs. each...... 11801
Trains, 15831- 16.3655...... 259082
333824
Engines, 15831 at 15 tons 237465
Total weight of passenger trains    571289
Total load passing on the way    1518413
In the above, we have allowed coach room for 64
passengers per trip, and have taken the weight of a first-class train at 21 tons, and a second class at 12∙6 tons ; the relative numbers of each being at the time we speak of, 13 to
,r 1    ,    . , c . . 21.13 + 12,6.16
10    ; hence the average welght of a tram is -f3⅛plθ--
= 16∙3655 tons, and more on longer lines from the luggage being heavier.
We have now to deduce the drawn and the passing weight over 1 mile upon a level, calling the Liverpool and Manchester railway equal to 34½ miles on a level, when due allowance is made for the gradients.

We now require the ratio of expenditure for passengers and goods, for locomotive power and maintenance of the way. This has generally been taken in proportion to the number of trips with each, which is clearly wrong. Both the weight and the velocity are evidently functions of the expenditure, taking the drawn weight in estimating the cost of the power and the passing weight for that of the way ; and as the cost of passengers and that of goods is not separated, which indeed could hardly bc done for the way, we have no guide, and can only make an approximation, by taking the cost directly as the weight and velocity. We have then
For locomotive power
23324242-15 : 11516928.25 or 319863630 :287923200, or as 1∙215 to 1.
This gives us in money,
Goods..........................L.370544
Passengers..................... 304974
ToUl.................. L.67552
A similar result drawn from the number of trips only, would give for the goods, L.28710, and the passengers L.38842, which is clearly inadmissible; unless we are prepared to say that the locomotive power is used in a most disadvantageous manner, of which we have no evidence. Hence, if we multiply the number of passengers by 0∙353585, or, which will be sufficiently accurate, by 0∙3536, it will give us the total weight drawn in trains, averaging as those did on the Liverpool and Manchester line at the time in question ; or, in other words, there are 2∙8282 passengers to a ton gross weight.
In order to apportion the expense of mainuining the way between the goods and passengers, we have,
For maintenance of the way,
3267577815: 19709470-25 or 490136670:492736750, or as 1 : 1∙005.
This gives us in money such a small difference from equal proportions, that we may safely venture to place halt the expense on each ; always premising, as we have before explained, that the workmanship in the waggon springs, wheels, and axles, is to be considered as of the best description, without which the expense may be almost anything.
The result deduced from the number of trips would have given us the goods’ expense to the passengers, nearly as 16 :22, an additional proof that this method is very erroneous. We are aware of the difficulties which envelope the whole question, especially in first working a railway, when the embankments settle down and render very expensive repairs necessary, without a single vehicle passing over the road, whilst the more it is used, the sooner it will get in perfect order. Nor are there any data to guide us correctly, as respects the effect of velocity ; but from an attentive consideration of the subject, combined with a comparison on many lines, we believe tile foregoing method to be that which agrees best with practical results, and with this we must rest satisfied till more experimental knowledge is acquired.
For the locomotive power, the cost of new engines and repairs must now be separated from that of the working expenditure in coke, oil, grease, waste, wages, &c. We shall find this to stand as follows :
Repairs, &c................................... L.42376
Working expenses.......................... 25176
