If, therefore, a rafter AG of a certain ſcantling is juſt able to carry the roofing laid on it, a rafter AB of the ſame ſcantling, but more elevated, will be too weak in the proportion of AG to AB. Therefore ſteeper roofs require ſtouter rafters, in order that they may be equally able to carry a roofing of equal weight per ſquare yard. To be equally ſtrong, they muſt be made broader, or placed nearer to each other, in the proportion of their greater length, or they muſt be made deeper in the fubd&lt; plicate proportion of their length. The following eaſy conſtruction will enable the artiſt not ſamiliar with computation to proportion the depth of the rafter to the ſlope of the roof.</p><p>Let the horizontal line <hi rend="italic">aſ</hi>  (fig. 4.) be the proper depth of a beam whoſe length is half the width of the building ; that is, ſuch as would make it fit for carrying the intended tiling laid on a flat roof. Draw the vertical line <hi rend="italic">ſ b,</hi>  and the line a<hi rend="italic">b</hi>  having the elevation of the rafter; make <hi rend="italic">a g</hi>  equal to <hi rend="italic">aſ,</hi>  and deſcribe the ſe-jnicircle <hi rend="italic">b dg</hi>  ; draw <hi rend="italic">a d</hi>  perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">a b, a d</hi>  is the required depth. The demonſtration is evident.</p><p>We have now treated in ſufficient detail what relates to the chief ſtrain on the component parts of a roof, namely, what' tends to break them tranſverſely ; and we have enlarged more on the ſubject than what the preſent occaſion indiſpenſably required, becauſe the propoſitions which we have demonſtrated are equally applicable, to all framings of carpentry, and are even of greater moment in many caſes, particularly in the conſtruction of machines. Theſe conſiſt of levers in various forms, which are ſtrained tranſverſely ; and ſimilar ſtrains frequently occur in many of the ſupporting and connecting parts. We ſhall give in the article Timber an account of the experiments which have been made by different naturaliſts, in order to aſeertain the abfolute ſtrength of ſome of the materials which are moſt generally framed together in buildings and engines. The houſe-carpenter will draw from them abſolute numbers, which he can apply to his particular purpoſes by means of the propoſitions which we have now eſtabliſhed.</p><p>We proceed, in the next place, to conſider the other ſtrains to which the parts of roofs are expoſed, in conſequence of the ſupport which they mutually give each other, and the preiſures (or <hi rend="italic">thruſts</hi>  as they are called in the language of the houſe carpenter) which they exert on each other, and on the walls or piers of the building.</p><p>Let a beam or piece of timber AB (fig. 5.) be ſuſpended by two lines AC, BD ; or let it be ſupported by two props AE, BF, which are perfectly moveable round their remote extremities E,F, or let it reſt on the two poliſhed plains KAH, LBM. Moreover, let G be the centre of gravity of the beam, and let GN be a line through the centre of gravity perpendicular to the horizon. The beam will not be in equilibrio unleſs the vertical line GN either paſſes through P, the point in which the directions of the two lines AC, BD, or the directions of the two props EA, FD, or the perpendiculars to the two planes KAH, LBM interſect each other, or is parallel to theſe directions. For the ſupports given by the lines or props are unqueſtionably exerted in the direction of their lengths ; and it is as well</p><lb/><p>known in mechanics that the ſupports given by planes are exerted in a direction perpendicular to thoſe planes in the points of contact ; and we know that the weight of the beam acts in the ſame manner as if it were all accumulated in its centre of gravity G, and that it acts in the direction GN perpendicular to the horizon. Moreover, when a body is in equilibrio between three forces, they are acting in one plane, and their directions are either parallel or they paſs through one point.</p><p>The ſupport given to the beam is therefore the ſame as if it were ſuſpended by two lines which are attached to the ſingle point P. We may alſo infer, that the points of ſuſpenſion C, D, the.points of ſupport E, F, the points of contact A, B, and the centre of gravity G, are all, in one vertical plane.</p><p>When this poſition of the beam is diſturbed by any external force, there muſt either be a motion of the points A and B round the centres of ſuſpenſion C and D, or of the props round theſe points of ſupport E and F, or a Aiding of the ends of the beam along the poliſhed planes GH and IK ; and in conſequence of theſe motions the centre of gravity G will go out of its place* and the vertical line GN will no longer paſs through the point where the directions of the ſupports interſect each other. If the centre of gravity riſes by this motion, the body will have a tendency to recover its former poſition, and it will require force to keep it away from it. In this caſe the equilibrium may be ſaid to be <hi rend="italic">fiable,</hi>  or the body to have <hi rend="italic">fiabiliιy.</hi>  But if the centre of gravity deſcends when the body is moved ſrom the poſition of equilibrium, it will tend to move ſtill farther;, and lo ſar will it be from recovering its former poſition, that it will now fall. This equilibrium may be called a <hi rend="italic">tottering equilibrium.</hi>  Theſe accidents depend on the ſituations of the points A, B, C, D, E, F ; and they may be determined by conſidering the ſubject geometrically. It does not much intereſt us at preſent ; it is. rarely that the equilibrium of ſuſpenſion is tottering, or that of props is ſtable. It is evident, that if the beam were ſuſpended by lines from the point P, it would have ſtability, for it would ſwing like a pendulum round P, and therefore would always tend towards the poſition of equilibrium. Hie interſection of the lines of ſupport would ſtill be at P, and the vertical line drawn through the centre of gravity, when in any other ſituation, would be on that ſide of P towards which this centre has been moved. Therefore, by the rules of pendulous bodies, it tends to come back. This would be more remarkably the caſe if the points of ſuſpenſion C and D be on the ſame ſide of the point P with the points of attachment A and B ; ſor in this caſe the new point of interſection of the lines of ſupport would ſhift to the oppoſite ſide, and be ſtill farther from the vertical line through the new poſition of the centre of gravity. But if the points of ſuſpenſion and of attachment are on oppoſite ſides of P, the new point of interſection may ſhift to the ſame ſide with the centre of gravity, and lie beyond the vertical line ; in this caſe the equilibrium is tottering. It is eaſy to perceive, too, that if the equilibrium of ſuſpenſion from the points C and D be ſtable, the equilibrium on the props AE and BF muſt be tottering. It is not neceſſary for our preſent purpoſe to engage more particularly in this diſcuſſion.</p><p>It is plain that, with reſpect to the mere momentary equilibrium, there is no difference in the ſupport,by</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
