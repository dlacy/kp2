An&nbsp;event that did much to diminish the influence of the pontiffs in connexion with it was the divulgcment in the year 304 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.,</span><span class="font2"> as already&nbsp;mentioned, by Cn. Flavius, of a formulary of actions and a calendar&nbsp;of lawful and unlawful days, which got the name of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jus Flavianum.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">The practice adopted in the beginning of the 6th century by Tiberius&nbsp;Cornneanius, the first plebeian chief pontiff, of giving advice in law&nbsp;in public had a still greater effect in popularizing it; and the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tripertita</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jus Aelianum,</span><span class="font2"> some fifty years later—a collection that&nbsp;included the Tables, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">interpretatio</span><span class="font2"> and the current styles of&nbsp;actions—made it as much the heritage of the laity as of the pontifical college.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Subsequent Legislation.—</span><span class="font2">Of legislation during the 4th and 5th centuries that affected the private law we have but scanty&nbsp;record. Tbc best-known enactments are the Canuleian&nbsp;law of 445 b.c. above mentioned; the Genucian,&nbsp;Marcian and other laws about usury and the rate of&nbsp;interest; the Poetilian law of 326 b.c. abolishing&nbsp;imprisonment of nexal debtors by their creditors; the Silian&nbsp;law, probably not long afterwards, which introduced a new form&nbsp;of process for actions of debt; and the Aquilian law about&nbsp;287 b.c., which amended the decern viral provisions for actions&nbsp;of damages for culpable injury to property, and continued to</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">regulate the law on the subject even in the books of Justinian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">iii. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Development of the Substantive Institutions of the Law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Citizen and his “ Caput.”—</span><span class="font2">The early law of Rome was essentially personal, not territorial. A man enjoyed the benefit&nbsp;of its institutions and of its protection, not because he&nbsp;happened to be within Roman territory, but because&nbsp;he was a citizen,—one of those by whom and for whom&nbsp;its law was established. The theory of the early</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Romans was that a man sojourning within the bounds of a foreign state was at the mercy of the latter and its citizens,&nbsp;that he himself might be dealt with as a slave, and all that&nbsp;belonged to him appropriated by the first comer; for he was&nbsp;outside the pale of the law. Without some sort of alliance&nbsp;with Rome a stranger had no right to claim protection against&nbsp;maltreatment of his person or attempt to deprive him of his&nbsp;property; and even then, unless he belonged to a state entitled&nbsp;by treaty to the international judicial remedy of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">recuperatio,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">it was by an appeal to the good offices of the supreme magistrate,&nbsp;or through the intervention of a citizen to whom he was allied&nbsp;by the (frequently hereditary) bond of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hospitium,</span><span class="font2"> and not by&nbsp;means of any action of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font2"> set in motion by himself.&nbsp;A non-citizen—originally </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hostis,</span><span class="font2"> and afterwards usually called&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">peregrinus<sup>@@1</sup> </span><span class="font2">in time came to be regarded as entitled to all the&nbsp;rights recognized by so-called jmj </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">gentium</span><span class="font2"> as belonging to a&nbsp;freeman, and to take part as freely as a Roman in any transaction&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus gcntium\</span><span class="font2"> but that was not until Rome, through&nbsp;contact with other nations and the growth of trade and commerce, had found it necessary to modify her jurisprudence by&nbsp;the adoption of many new institutions of a more liberal and less&nbsp;exclusive character than those of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A citizen’s civil personality was technically his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">caput.</span><span class="font2"> The extent of it depended on his family status. It was only among&nbsp;citizens that the supremacy of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font2"> and the subjection of those </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in manu, potestate</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mancipio</span><span class="font2"> were recognized—only among them therefore that the position of an&nbsp;individual in the family was of moment. While in public life&nbsp;a man’s supremacy or subjection in the family was immaterial,&nbsp;in private life it was the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font2"> alone who enjoyed full&nbsp;jural capacity. Those subject to him had a more limited&nbsp;personality; and, so far as capacity to take part in transactions&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font2"> was concerned, it was not inherent in them but&nbsp;derived from their </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias*,</span><span class="font2"> they were the agents of his</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font2">Whenever a citizen cither ceased altogether to be a member of a Roman family or passed, either permanently or temporarily,&nbsp;into subjection to some </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font2"> outside his own&nbsp;family,<sup>@@2</sup> there was technically </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">capitis minutio</span><span class="font2"> or&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">deminutio.</span><span class="font2"> To harmonize with the gradually established conception of jural personality in non-citizens, and perhaps&nbsp; also from their partiality for tripartite divisions, the jurists&nbsp;about the end of the Republic divided </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">capitis deminutio</span><span class="font2"> into three&nbsp;degrees, viz. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">maxima, media</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">minima—</span><span class="font2">a division unknown&nbsp;to lawyers of an earlier period when </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">civitas</span><span class="font2"> was theoretically&nbsp;identified with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">libcrlas.</span><span class="font2"> When a citizen forfeited his freedom,&nbsp;his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">capitis deminutio</span><span class="font2"> was said to be </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">maxima}</span><span class="font2"> he lost all capacity,&nbsp;whether under the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font2"> or the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium.</span><span class="font2"> When, retaining freedom, he went into exile or joined a Latin colony, or&nbsp;otherwise became a peregrin, the loss </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{deminutio}</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> of </span><span class="font2">his capacity&nbsp;was only </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">media</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">minor}</span><span class="font2"> it was his rights and privileges under&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font2"> that alone were affected.

<p><span class="font2">An important consequence of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">minima capitis deminutio</span><span class="font2"> was that it not only extinguished </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas</span><span class="font2"> where it existed,&nbsp;but severed the bond of agnation between the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">capite minntus&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and all those who had previously been related to him as agnates.&nbsp;There was no longer any right of succession between them on&nbsp;intestacy; their reciprocal prospective rights of tutory were&nbsp;defeated, and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">minutio</span><span class="font2"> of either tutor or ward put an end to&nbsp;a subsisting guardianship, assuming always that it was a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tutcla&nbsp;legitima</span><span class="font2"> or agnatic </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cura furiosi.</span><span class="font2"> Very remarkable, yet quite&nbsp;logical, was the doctrine that the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">minutio</span><span class="font2"> extinguished the&nbsp;claims of creditors of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">minntus}</span><span class="font2"> their debtor, the person&nbsp;with whom they had contracted, was civilly dead, and dead&nbsp;without an heir, and therefore there was no one against whom&nbsp;an action of the/ms </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">civile</span><span class="font2"> could be directed in order to enforce&nbsp;payment.
