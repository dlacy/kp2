<p><span class="font0">tion is perpcndſeular to the axis oſ rotation paſſing through the centre of gravity, the two motions progreſſive and rotatory are equivalent to a momentary ſimple motion of rotation round a ſpontaneous axis of con-verſion, which is at reſt: but when the progreſſive motion&nbsp;is inclined to the axis paſſing thro’ the centre, the fponta-neous aχis of converſon is Aiding in its own direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We may conceive the whole of this very diſtinctly and accurately by attending to the motion of a garden roller. We may ſuppoſe it ſix feet in circumference,&nbsp;and that it is dragged along at the rate of three feet in&nbsp;a ſecond from eaſt to weft, the axis of the roller lying&nbsp;north and ſouth. Suppoſe a chalk line drawn on the&nbsp;ſurface of the roller parallel to its axis. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ί</span><span class="font0"> he roller wfill&nbsp;turn once round in tw o féconds, and this line wfill be in&nbsp;contact wfith the ground at the intervals of every fix&nbsp;ſeet. In that inſtant the line on the roller now ſpoken&nbsp;of is at reſt, and the motion is the ſame as if it were&nbsp;fixed, and the roller really turning round it. In ſhort,&nbsp;it is then a ſpontaneous axis of converſion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Now, ſuppoſe the roller dragged in the ſame manner and in the ſame direction along a ſheet of ice, while the&nbsp;ice is floating to the ſouth at the rate of four feet in a&nbsp;ſecond. It is now plain that the roller is turning round&nbsp;an axis through its centre of gravity, while the centre&nbsp;is carried in the direction </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſ</span><span class="font0"> 36<sup>0</sup> 52' W. at the rate of&nbsp;five feet </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font0"> ſecond. It is alſo plain, that when the line&nbsp;drawn on the ſurface of the ſtone is applied to the ice,&nbsp;its only motion is that which the ice itſelf has to the&nbsp;ſouthward. The motion is now' a motion oi rotation&nbsp;round this ſpontaneous axis of converſion, compounded wfith the motion of four feet </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font0"> ſecond in the direction oſ this axis. And thus we ſee that any complication of motion of rotation round an axis paſſing through&nbsp;the centre of gravity, and a motion of progreſſion of&nbsp;that centre, may always be reduced to a momentary or&nbsp;incipient motion of rotation round another axis parallel&nbsp;to the former, compounded with a motion of that axis&nbsp;in its own direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The demonſtration wſhich we have given of theſe two propoſitions points out the method of finding the axis&nbsp;C </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c,</span><span class="font0"> the incipient rotation round wſhich is equivalent to&nbsp;the combined progreſſive motion of the body, and the&nbsp;rotation round the axis G<sub>i</sub>y. We have only to note the&nbsp;rotatory velocity A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span class="font0"> oſ ſome particle , and its diſtance A<sub>ι</sub>g from the axis, and the progreſſive velocity&nbsp;GI oſ the whole body, and then to make G C a fourth&nbsp;proportional to Δ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b,</span><span class="font0"> GI, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font0"> A, and to place GC in a&nbsp;plane perpendicular to G I, which is perpendicular to&nbsp;Gy, and to place C on that fide of G<sub>t</sub>^ w<sup>τ</sup>hich is&nbsp;moving in the oppoſite direction to the axis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the ſimple caſe of this problem, which we exhibited in order to give us eaſy and familiar notions of the ſubject, it appeared that the retrograde velocity of rotation of the point C was equal to the progreſſive velocity of the centre. This muſt be the caſe in e⅛ery point&nbsp;of tħe circumference of the circle of which CG, fig. 9.&nbsp;is the radius. Therefore, as the body advances, and&nbsp;turns round G, this circle will apply itſelf in ſucceſſion&nbsp;to the line CK parallel to G </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">y</span><span class="font0"> ; and any individual point&nbsp;of it, ſuch as C, will deſcribe a cycloid of which this&nbsp;circle is the generating circle, C K the baſe, and C G&nbsp;half the altitude. The other points of the body will&nbsp;deſcribe trochoids, elongated or contracted according&nbsp;as the deſcribir.g points are </span><span class="font1">nearer to or more remote&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">&amp;om </span><span class="font1">G </span><span class="font0">than the point C </span><span class="font1">is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is now' evident that all this muſt obtain in every caſe, as well as in this limple one. And when we have&nbsp;aſeertained the diſtance G C between the axis of rotation&nbsp;paſſing through the centre, and the momentary lponta-neous axis of converſion paſſing through C, we can then&nbsp;aſcertain the relation betw<sup>τ</sup>een the motions of rotation&nbsp;and progreſſion. We then know that the body will&nbsp;make one rotation round its central axis, While its centre moves over a ſpace equal to the circumference of a&nbsp;circle of a known diameter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We muſt therefore proceed to the methods ſor determining the poſition of the point C. This muſt depend on the proportion between the velocity of the general progreſſive motion, that is, the velocity of the centre, and the velocity of ſome point of the body.—&nbsp;This muſt be aſeertained by obſervation. In moſt caſes&nbsp;wſhich are intereſting, wè learn the po tion of the axis,&nbsp;the place of its poles, the comparative progreſſive velθ'∙&nbsp;city of the centre, and the velocity of rotation of the&nbsp;different points, in a variety oſ w<sup>r</sup>ays ; and it would not&nbsp;much increaſe our knowledge to detail the rules which&nbsp;may be followed ſor this purpoſe. The circumſtance&nbsp;which chiefly intereſts us at preſent is to know how&nbsp;theſe motions may be produced ; what force is neceſe&nbsp;ſary, and how it muſt be applied, in order to produce a&nbsp;given motion of rotation and progreſſion ; or what&nbsp;will be the motion wſhich a given force, applied in </span><span class="font1">a.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">given manner, wfill produce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have already given- the principles on wſhich we may proceed in this inveſtigation. We have ſhown the&nbsp;circumſtances which determine the place of the centre&nbsp;of percuſſion of a body turning round a given fixed&nbsp;axis. Γhis centre of percuſſion is the point of thc&nbsp;body where all the inherent forces oſ the whirling body&nbsp;preciſely balance each other, or rather where they unite&nbsp;and compoſe one accumulated progreſſive force, which&nbsp;may then be oppoſed by an equal and oppoſite external&nbsp;force If, therefore, the body is not whirling, but&nbsp;at reſt on this i.xed axis, and if this external force be&nbsp;applied at the centre of percuſſion, now become </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">apoini&nbsp;oſ impvlfiοn,</span><span class="font0"> a rotation wfill commence round the fixed&nbsp;axis preciſely equal to wſhat had been ſtopped by this&nbsp;external force, but in the oppoſite direction ; or, if the&nbsp;external force be applied in the direction in which the&nbsp;centre of percuſſion of the whirling body was moving&nbsp;at the inſtant of ſtoppage, the rotation produced by&nbsp;this impulſe will be the ſame in every reſpect. And we&nbsp;found that in the inſtant of application of this external&nbsp;force, either to ſtop or to begin the motion, no preſſure&nbsp;whatever was excited on the ſupports of the axis, and&nbsp;that the axis was, in this inſtant, a ſpontaneous axis of&nbsp;converſion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Moreover, we have ſhown, art. 84, that a rotation round any axis, wſhether fixed or ſpontaneous, is equivalent to, or compounded of, a rotation, round another&nbsp;axis </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">parallel to it,</span><span class="font0"> and paſſing through the centre of&nbsp;gravity, and a progreſſive motion in the direction of&nbsp;the centre’s motion at the inſtant of impulſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Now, as the poſition oſ the fixed axis, and the known diſpoſition of all the particles of the body with&nbsp;reſpect to this axis, determines the place of the centre&nbsp;of percuſſion, and furniſhes all the mathematical conditions which muſt be implemented in its determination,&nbsp;and the direction and magnitude of the force which is&nbsp;produced and exerted at the centre of percuſſion ; ſo, on&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the other hand, the knowledge of the magnitude </span><span class="font0">and.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
