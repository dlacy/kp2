<p><label>RUNDALE</label>
(apparently from “to run” and “dale,” valley, originally something separated off, cf. “ deal”), the name of a form of occupation of land, somewhat resembling the English “ common field ” system. The land is divided into discontinuous plots, and cultivated and occupied by a number of tenants to whom it is leased jointly. The system was common in Ireland, especially in the western counties. In Scotland, where the system also existed, it was termed “ run-rig ” (from “ run,” and “ rig ” or “ ridge ”).</p>
