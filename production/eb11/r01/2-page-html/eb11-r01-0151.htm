Rats have, however, generally more rows of scales&nbsp;on the tail (reaching&nbsp;to 210 or more) than&nbsp;mice, in which the&nbsp;number does not&nbsp;exceed 180. For the&nbsp;distinctive characteristics of the family&nbsp;Muridae and the&nbsp;genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mus,</span><span class="font1"> to which&nbsp;true rats and true&nbsp;mice alike belong, sec&nbsp;Rodentia. Of the&nbsp;two British species&nbsp;the brown, or Norway rat </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">M. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">norvegicus)</span><span class="font1"> is distinguished&nbsp;by its large size,&nbsp;brownish grey colour,&nbsp;short tail and ears,&nbsp;stout skull, and the&nbsp;possession of from 10 to 12 teats. It is fierce and cunning,&nbsp;and easily overcomes all allied species with which it is&nbsp;brought in contact. Its original home would seem to have&nbsp;been some part of Central Asia, an indigenous species from&nbsp;China, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">M. humiliatus</span><span class="font1">, being so like it that in all probability the latter is the original race from which it has&nbsp;sprung. Thence it has spread to all parts of the world,&nbsp;driving out the house-haunting species everywhere, as it has&nbsp;in England all but exterminated the black rat. The brown&nbsp;rat migrated westwards from Central Asia early in the 18th&nbsp;century, and is believed to have first reached Great Britain&nbsp;about 1730. Its already evil reputation has been increased&nbsp;of late years by the fact that it is one of the chief disseminators&nbsp;of bubonic plague. Black phases are not uncommon. The&nbsp;black rat </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(M. rattus)</span><span class="font1"> is distinguishable from the brown rat by&nbsp;its smaller size, longer ears and tail, and glossy black colour.&nbsp;It shares the roving habits of the latter, frequenting ships and&nbsp;by these means reaching various parts of the world. On this&nbsp;account either the typical form or the tropical </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">M. ratius alexandrinus</span><span class="font1"> is common in many places to which the brown species&nbsp;has not yet penetrated, for instance in South America. This&nbsp;long-tailed rat, originally a native of India, would seem to have&nbsp;first penetrated to all parts of the world and to have nearly&nbsp;or quite exterminated the indigenous rats. After this followed the advance of the more powerful brown rat. The&nbsp;black rat first reached Europe in the 13th century; but of&nbsp;late years another and still darker phase of the species, the&nbsp;Black Sea black rat (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">M. rattus ater</span><span class="font1">) made its appearance in</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">England. The Isle of Dogs and Yarmouth, in Norfolk, are reported to be the chief of the English strongholds of the black&nbsp;rat. Both species agree in their predaceous habits, omnivorous&nbsp;diet and great fecundity. They bear, four or five times in the&nbsp;year, from four to ten blind and naked young, which are in their&nbsp;turn able to breed at an age of about six months; the time of&nbsp;gestation being about twenty days.</span></p><h2><span class="font1">See J.

<p><span class="font1">RATAFIA, a liqueur or cordial flavoured with peach or cherry kernels, bitter almonds, or other fruits; many different&nbsp;varieties are made. The same name is given to a flavouring&nbsp;essence resembling bitter almonds, and also to a light biscuit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The word is adapted from the French of the 17th century. Skeat </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Etym. Dict.,</span><span class="font1"> 1910) quotes as a possible origin a combination of Malay </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">araq,</span><span class="font1"> arrack, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tafia,</span><span class="font1"> rum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RATE, a general term for proportion, standard, allowance, tax (Med. Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rata,</span><span class="font1"> from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pro rata parte, ratus</span><span class="font1"> being the participle&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rcri,</span><span class="font1"> to think, judge). In England the term is specially&nbsp;applied to the levying of public money contributions for local&nbsp;purposes, as distinguished from the “ taxes ’’ raised for what are&nbsp;treated as general state purposes. The money required for&nbsp;local administration in England is raised (when the ordinary&nbsp;revenues are insufficient) by assessments on lands and buildings&nbsp;based on their annual rental value. The financial authority&nbsp;estimates what additional amount beyond revenue is required&nbsp;for the expenses of administration, and levies a rate to meet it.&nbsp;The earliest rate levied in England was that for poor relief, and&nbsp;of the great variety of rates now existing, the majority are based&nbsp;on the poor rate and levied with it, under the term of precept&nbsp;rates. Next to the poor rate came that for highways, and other&nbsp;special rates have been authorized from time to time, as for&nbsp;police, education, public lighting, cemeteries, libraries, sanitary&nbsp;purposes, &amp;c. To distinguish the rate the name of the pre-cepting authority is frequently added or the purpose for which&nbsp;it is levied specified as county rate, watch rate, &amp;c. The&nbsp;valuation list of a parish is the basis on which the poor rate is&nbsp;levied. This valuation list contains the gross estimated rental&nbsp;and rateable value of all rateable property in the parish. The&nbsp;gross estimated rental is the rent at which a property might&nbsp;reasonably be expected to let from year to year, the tenant&nbsp;paying tithes, rates and taxes. From this is deducted the&nbsp;average annual cost of repairs, insurance and renewals, the&nbsp;balance constituting the rateable value. The rateable value&nbsp;of the parish being known, so much on each pound of the rateable&nbsp;value as will equal the amount required to be raised is levied,&nbsp;and is known as the “ rate.’’ See further England, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Local&nbsp;Government; </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Taxation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rating, in maritime vocabulary, is the classification of men according to rank, and was formerly employed to class ships of&nbsp;a navy according to strength. A sailor is said to be “ rated&nbsp;A.B.,’’ or in the navy “ rated petty officer,&quot; “ seaman,’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ gunner,’’ and so on. The rating of ships began in the 17th century, and was at first done roughly by size and number of&nbsp;crew. Later the rating was by guns. Thus in 1741 in the&nbsp;British navy there were six rates: 1st, 100 guns; 2nd, 90;&nbsp;3rd, 70 to 80; 4th, 50 to 60; 5th, 40; and 6th, 20. Sloops, fireships, bomb-vessels and royal yachts were said to be not rated.&nbsp;The classification of ships into six rates, and into rated and&nbsp;non-rated ships, continued during the existence of the old sailing&nbsp;fleets, with modifications in detail. The practice of other navies&nbsp;was similar to the British.</span></p>
