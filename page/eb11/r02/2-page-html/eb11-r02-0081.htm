<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Parthenogenesis</span><span class="font1"> is thc production of the new organism from the female gamete without previous conjugation with thc male&nbsp;gamete, and is to be regarded as secondary to and degenerate&nbsp;from true sexual reproduction. Aristotle recognized that it&nbsp;occurred in the bee. In 1745 C. Bonnet showed that it must&nbsp;occur in the case of Aphides or plant-lice, in which throughout&nbsp;the summer there were developed a series of generations consisting entirely of females. R. A. F. de Reaumur repeated the&nbsp;observations, but evaded the difficulty by suggesting that thc&nbsp;Aphides were hermaphrodite, an explanation soon afterwards&nbsp;disproved by L. Dufour. In 1849 (Sir) R.-Chven brought together the facts as they were* then known and made a remarkable suggestion regarding them. “Not all the progeny of the&nbsp;primary impregnated germ cell are required for the formation&nbsp;of thc body in all animals; certain of the derivative germ cells&nbsp;may remain unchanged and become included in that body&nbsp;which has been composed of their metamorphosed and diversely&nbsp;combined or confluent brethren; so included, any derivative&nbsp;germ cell or the nucleus of such may begin and repeat the same&nbsp;processes of growth by imbibition, and of propagation by&nbsp;spontaneous fission, as thosc to which itself owed its origin.”&nbsp;Taking hold of the recently published views of J. J. S. Steenstrup&nbsp;on alternation of generations, he correlated the sexual and&nbsp;asexual alternation in hydroids çmd so forth with the virgin&nbsp;births of insects and Crustacea, and regarded the one and the&nbsp;other as instances of the subsequent proliferation of included&nbsp;germ cells, applying the word parthenogenesis to thc phenomenon. His theory was a very remarkable anticipation of thc&nbsp;germ-plasm theory of A. Weismann, but further knowledge&nbsp;showed that there was an important distinction between the&nbsp;reproduction of the asexual generations described by Steenstrup&nbsp;and the cases of Aphides and Crustacea, the germinal cells in&nbsp;the latter instances being true ova produced from the ovaries&nbsp;of true females, but capable of development without fertilization.&nbsp;In 1856 C. T. E. von Siebold established this fact and limited&nbsp;Owen’s term parthenogenesis to thc sense in which it is now&nbsp;used, the development without fertilization of ova produced in&nbsp;ovaries. True parthenogenesis occurs frequently amongst&nbsp;Rotifers, and in certain eases (Philodinadae) males either do not&nbsp;exist or are so rare that they have not been discovered. Amongst&nbsp;Crustaceans it is common in Branchiopods and Ostracods; in&nbsp;the case of Daphnids, large thick-shelled ova are produced&nbsp;towards winter, which develop only after fertilization and&nbsp;produce females; the latter, throughout summer, produce&nbsp;thin-shelled ova which do not require fertilization, and from&nbsp;which towards autumn both males and females are produced.&nbsp;Amongst insects it occurs in many forms in many different&nbsp;groups, sometimes occasional, sometimes as a regular occurrence.&nbsp;Apart from Aphides the classical instance is that of the bee,&nbsp;where eggs that are not fertilized develop parthenogenetically&nbsp;and produce only drones. What is ' known as pathological&nbsp;parthenogenesis has been observed occasionally in higher&nbsp;animals, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> the frog, the fowl and certain mammals, whilst&nbsp;in the ease of human beings, ovarian cysts in which hair and other&nbsp;structures are produced have been attributed to the incomplete&nbsp;development of parthenogenetic ova. Finally, it has been&nbsp;shown in a number of different instances, notably by J. Loeb,&nbsp;that artificial parthenogenesis may bc induced by various&nbsp;mechanical and chemical stimulations. It has been shown that&nbsp;ova may be induced to segment by the presence of spermatozoa&nbsp;belonging even to different classes of the animal kingdom—as,&nbsp;for instance, the ova of echinoderms by the spermatozoa of&nbsp;molluscs. In such cases the resulting embryos have purely&nbsp;maternal characters. A possible interpretation is that spermatozoa have two functions which may be exercised independently;&nbsp;they may act as stimulants to the ovum to segment, and they&nbsp;may convey the paternal qualities. The former function may&nbsp;be replaced by the chemical substances employed in producing&nbsp;artificial parthenogenesis. Juvenile or precocious parthenogenesis, in which there takes place reproduction without fertilization in immature larvae, has been observed chiefly in&nbsp;insects (Dipterous midges), and to this the term </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paedogenesis&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">has been applied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The theory of parthenogenesis remains doubtful. When Wcismann and others began to study thc polar bodies, they&nbsp;made thc remarkable discovery that in some parthenogenetic&nbsp;eggs only one polar body was extruded, but thc meaning of this&nbsp;distinction was blurred when other cases were described in which&nbsp;two polar bodies were formed. Later on, Weismann drew&nbsp;attention to thc difference between normal and reducing&nbsp;divisions, and it now appears to be clear that, with one set of&nbsp;exceptions, ova which develop without fertilization arc those in&nbsp;which no reducing division takes place and which, accordingly,&nbsp;contain the number of chromosomes normal to the tissue cells&nbsp;of the species. Such eggs, in fact, resemble thc zygote except&nbsp;that all their chromosomes are of maternal origin and the&nbsp;centrosome which becomes active in the first segmentation is&nbsp;that of the ovum and not, as in normal fertilized eggs, that which&nbsp;came in with the spermatozoon. The case of the bee and other&nbsp;insects in which parthenogenetic development results in thc production of males, is doubtful; it appears to bc the case that a&nbsp;reduction division has taken place in the maturation of thc egg.&nbsp;A. Petrunkévitch has made the ingenious suggestion, that after&nbsp;the reducing division the normal number of chromosomes is&nbsp;restored by thc splitting of each into two. Cases of pathological and artificial parthenogenesis would fall into line, on the&nbsp;supposition that the stimulus acted by preventing thc occurrence&nbsp;of a reducing division in an ovum otherwise mature. It is to be&nbsp;noticed, however, that such explanations of parthenogenesis&nbsp;are not much more than a formal harmonizing of the behaviour&nbsp;of the chromosomes in the respective cases of fertilized and&nbsp;parthenogenetic development; they do not provide a theory as&nbsp;to why the process occurs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Accessory Reproductive Organs and Processes.—</span><span class="font1">It has been already stated that the primary organs of reproduction in&nbsp;animals are the germinal tissues producing respectively spermatozoa and ova, and that in most cases these arc aggregated&nbsp;to form testes and ovaries. In certain animals there are no&nbsp;accessory organs, and when the reproductive products are ripe,&nbsp;they are discharged directly to the exterior if the gonads are&nbsp;external, as in some Coelentera, or if they are internal, break&nbsp;through into some cavity of the body and escape by rupture of the&nbsp;body-wall or through some natural aperture. In a majority of&nbsp;cases, however, special duets are developed, which in the male&nbsp;serve primarily for the escape of the spermatozoa, but secondarily&nbsp;may be associated with intromittent organs. Similarly, in the&nbsp;female, the primary function of the gonad ducts is to provide&nbsp;a passage for the ova, but in many cases they serve also for thc&nbsp;reception of spermatozoa, for the development of embryos and&nbsp;for the subsequent exit of the young. Associated with the ovary&nbsp;and the oviducts are many kinds of yolk-glands and shell-glands,&nbsp;the function of which is to form nutritive material for the future&nbsp;embryo, to discharge this into or around the ovum, and to provide&nbsp;protective wrappings. Although, in the last resort, fertilization depends on impulses attracting the spermatozoa to the ova, probably&nbsp;chemical in their nature, the necessary proximity is secured in&nbsp;a number of ways. In many simple cases the ripe products are&nbsp;discharged directly into the surrounding water, and impregnation&nbsp;is a matter of accident highly probable because such animals&nbsp;discharge enormous quantities of ova and spermatozoa, are&nbsp;frequently sessile and live in colonies, and are mature about thc&nbsp;same time. In other cases, as, for instance, Tunicates and many&nbsp;Molluscs, thc spermatozoa arc discharged, and, being drawn into&nbsp;the body of the female with the inhalent currents, there fertilize&nbsp;the ova. In yet a number of other cases, there is sexual congress&nbsp;without intromittence. The males of many fish, such as salmon,&nbsp;attend the females about to discharge their ova, and afterwards&nbsp;pour the male fluid over the liberated eggs; whilst amongst&nbsp;other fish thc males seek out a suitable locality and prepare some&nbsp;kind of nest to which the female is enticed and which receives&nbsp;first the ova and then thc milt. In many other animals, again,&nbsp;as for instance thc frog, the male grasps the ripe female, embracing</span></p>
