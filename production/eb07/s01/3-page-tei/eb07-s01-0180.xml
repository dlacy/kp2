In the year 1684 he was collated to a prebend in the cathedral of St Paul’s. Dr Hickes tells us, that, after the revolution, “ he first refused the bishopric of Chester, because he would not take the oath of homage ; and afterwards another bishopric, the deanery of Worcester, and a prebend of the church of Windsor, because they were all places of deprived men.” He published several excellent works, particularly the Christian Life, and died in the year 1695. He was eminent for his humanity, affability, sincerity, and readiness to do good ; and his talent for preaching was extraordinary.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scott</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Thomas,</hi> an eminent divine of the Church of England, was born on the 16th of February 1747. His father was a grazier in Lincolnshire, in humble circumstances, with thirteen children, of whom Thomas was the tenth. The father was ambitious that one of his sons should belong to a learned profession, and with this view sent the subject of this memoir, when about fifteen years of age, to be apprentice to an apothecary and surgeon at Alford. In this situation he conducted himself so improperly, that after a short time he was dismissed by his master, and sent home in disgrace. His father, mortified and vexed by the conduct of his son, treated him with great harshness, and employed him only in the lowest and most laborious drudgery about the farm. For nine years after his return home in disgrace, he was exposed to great hardships, associated with persons in the lowest stations of society, and often joined in their riotous and abandoned pursuits. Conceiving himself used with unjust severity by his father, his temper was soured, and he became exceedingly irritable and discontented.</p><p>His employment of tending the sheep left him often in solitude. At these seasons his mind was filled with bitter reflections on the past, and gloomy anticipations of the future ; and although his education had been very superficial, yet he had acquired so much as awakened in him an insatiable longing after the pleasures and distinctions of literature ; and every thing conspired to disgust him with his present employment.</p><p>When about twenty-five years of age, to the astonishment of every one, he declared his resolution of entering into the church. This scheme was strongly opposed by his father, treated as chimerical by his friends, and ridiculed by his neighbours. At length, however, his unconquerable fortitude and patient perseverance overcame every obstacle, and he was admitted to priest’s orders in the year 1773, and shortly thereafter was appointed curate of Weston Underwood, with a salary of L.50 a year. While here, he applied with indefatigable zeal and industry to the study of sacred and profane literature. His sentiments at first were decidedly Socinian ; but a candid and diligent study of the Scriptures gradually opened his eyes to the fallacy and the dangers of the doctrines which he had espoused ; and being in the neighbourhood of John Newton, the friend of Cowper, who was strongly evangelical and Calvinistic in his views, his acquaintance with that eminent individual may have contributed to this change in his religious sentiments. In the year 1779 he published a small autobiography, entitled the Force of Truth, in which he gave a candid statement of the change in his opinions, and the steps by which he was gradually led to adopt the orthodox and evangelical creed. This publication made a great sensation at the time, and has gone through many editions since. He married, in 1774, Jane Kell, who proved a valuable helpmate to him in his future struggles. In 1780 he succeeded John Newton at Olney, and in 1785 he accepted the situation of lecturer at the Lock Hospital, with a salary of L.80 a year. This, with small sums for occasional lectureships, furnished but a scanty allowance for the support of an increasing family; and when, a few years afterwards, a proposal was made to him by a London bookseller to write a Commentary on the Bible, to be published in numbers, the offer of a guinea a week, as remuneration for his writings, decided him to engage in the undertaking.</p><p>This valuable work was well received by the public, and, under proper management, ought to have been a very profitable speculation ; but, owing to the bankruptcy of the bookseller, Mr Scott not only received no remuneration for his labour, but lost all his little savings, and was involved in considerable debt. The first edition, of two thousand copies, commenced in 1802, and was finished in 1809; a second of two thousand copies, in 1807-11 ; the third, of three thousand copies, in six volumes 4to, 1812—14. The fourth was stereotyped, and sold to a great extent. He published a volume of Essays in 1793-94. He also published, in two volumes 8vo, Remarks on the Bishop of Lincoln’s Refutation of Calvinism ; and Sermons on various subjects, from time to time. His Theological Works were collected and edited by his son, the Reverend John Scott, and published in ten volumes 8vo, in 1823.</p><p>In 1803 he left London for the rectory of Aston, Sandford, where he died on the 16th of April 1821. He was a man of eminent piety, somewhat eager and impetuous, but of great sincerity, and sterling honesty of character; of a vigorous intellect, indefatigably diligent in his studies, and a useful and practical preacher.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scott, </hi><hi rend="italic">Sir Walter,</hi> was born at Edinburgh on the 15th of August 1771. “ My birth,” says he, “ was neither distinguished nor sordid. According to the prejudices of my country, it was esteemed <hi rend="italic">gentle,</hi> as I was connected, though remotely, with ancient families, both by my father’s and mother’s side.” His paternal great-grandfather was a cadet of the border family of Harden, which has been ennobled within the last few years, and sprung in the fourteenth century from the great house of Buccleuch ; his grandfather became a farmer in Roxburghshire, and married a lady who was a relation of his own ; and his father, Walter Scott, was a writer to the signet in the Scottish capital. The poet’s mother, Anne Rutherford, who was likewise of honourable descent, was the daughter of one of the medical professors in the university of Edinburgh.</p><p>Neither Scott’s poetical turn nor his extraordinary powers of memory seem to have been inherited from either of his parents. His early years displayed as little precocity of talent as did the steady development of his mind in riper days ; and the uneventful tenor of his childhood and youth, although their impressions can now be traced vividly in his works, must have seemed, but for these, as little calculated as possible to awaken in his mind a love of the imaginative or romantic.</p><p>Delicacy of constitution, accompanied by a lameness which proved permanent, exhibited itself before he had completed his second year, and caused soon afterwards his removal to the country. There, at his grandfather’s farmhouse of Sandyknowe, situated beneath the crags of a ruined baronial tower, and overlooking a tract of many miles studded with spots famous in border-history, the poet passed his childhood till about his eighth year, with scarcely any interruption but that of a year spent at Bath. From this early period there are related some interesting anecdotes of his sympathy with the grandeur and beauty of nature. The tenacity of his infantine recollections gave promise of what was afterwards so remarkable a faculty in his mind; and the ballads and legends, which were recited to him amidst the scenes in which their events were laid, co-operated in after-days with family and national pride to decide the bent of the border-minstrel’s fancy.</p><p>His health being partially confirmed, he was recalled home ; and from the end of 1779 until 1783 his education was conducted in the High School of Edinburgh, with the assistance of a tutor resident in his father’s house. In the years immediately preceding this change, he had shewn</p></body></text></TEI>
