The remedies uſed in inflammation, in general, ſeem uſeful in every caſe of inflammation of the breaſts. When the patient happens to be nurſing, a hidden evacuation of blood is apt to diminiſh the quantity of milk : In ſuch caſes, therefore, blood is to be extracted in ſmall quantities at a time. The application of cooling ſaturnine poultices is adviſable. When suppuration has taken place, the matter is to be diſcharged by making an inciſion in the moſt depending part of the tumor.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Inflammation of the Testicles.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> diſeaſe is often owing to expoſure to cold, violent exerciſe, &amp;c. ; but moſt frequently to gonorrhoea virulenta, and never to matter falling down upon the teſtes, as was ſuppoſed by thoſe who gave it the name of <hi rend="italic">hernia humoralis. </hi>Inflammation here rarely terminates in ſuppuration.</p><p>The beſt method for diſcuſſing the inflammation is by the application of leeches; after which the penis ought to be kept conſtantly moiſtened with a ſolution of ſaccharum ſaturni, and the ſcrotum and teſtes ſupported by a proper bandage. The bowels ſhould be kept moderately open ; the patient ſhould uſe a low diet, and keep as much as possible in an horizontal poſture. If lues venerea be preſent, a cure cannot be expected without mercury. If the diſeaſe is owing to a ſudden ſtoppage of the diſcharge in gonorrhoea, the running ought to be reſtored, and promoted by bathing the penis in warm water, injecting warm oil, and the uſe of bougies. Theſe means will generally diſcuſs the inflammation. If matter form, it muſt be diſcharged.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Of Venereal Buboes.</hi></p><p>A <hi rend="smallcaps">swelling</hi> of any of the lymphatic glands of the body is called a <hi rend="italic">bubo ;</hi> and when ſuch a ſwelling proceeds from venereal poiſon, it is termed <hi rend="italic">venereal bubo.</hi> They ſeldom or never appear except in the lymphatic glands of the groin, arm-pit, or extremities, and much more frequently in the groin than anywhere else.</p><p>In the treatment of buboes, a ſtrict antiphlogiſtic regimen is to be uſed to promote a reſolution ; the application of leeches to the hardened gland is particularly proper. In discuſſing venereal buboes, the application of mercurial ointment has a conſiderable effect. After ſuppuration is completely formed, the application of cauſtic to open the bubo is dangerous, left it ſhould corrode ſome of the conſiderable blood- veſſels, which generally lie contiguous to the bubo. Buboes, when opened by the knife, are said to heal with more difficulty, and generally to leave a ſcar behind them. To allow them to burſt of themſelves, is therefore ſor the moſt part proper, except when the collection is ſo conſiderable as to press upon the neighbouring blood-veſſels. In ſuch a caſe, a ſmall inciſion may be made by the lancet, taking as much care as poſſible to prevent the admisſion of the external air into the wound. When the edges of the opening grow callous, the application of lunar cauſtic to them becomes neceſſary. During the remaining part of the cure, mercury joined with opium is to be uſed.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV. <hi rend="italic">Lumbar Abſceſs.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> term <hi rend="italic">lumbar</hi> may be applied to every abſceſs ſeated in the loins ; but that which is here meant is ſuch as begins about the top of the os sacrum, and is ſeated in the vicinity of the great pſoas muſcle.</p><p>The ſymptoms begin with pain and tenſion about the loins, ſhooting upwards to the ſpine and downwards to the thigh. The diſeaſe has ſometimes a ſtrong reſemblance to nephritic affections, and is ſometimes miſtaken for lumbago. After ſuppuration takes place, ſhivering fits come on ; and the pain now becoming dull, the patient imagines himſelf better, till matter points at the side of the anus, or in the groin. The firſt caſe is rare ; and when it does occur, the tumor burſts, or is opened as a common abſceſs. In the other caſe, the matter is ſeated behind the faſcia of the groin, and ſometimes deſcends as far as the knee. The teguments commonly retain their natural appearance. Fluctuation is evident, eſpecially when the patient is in an upright poſture. It is often miſtaken ſor crural hernia ; but may be eaſily diſtinguiſhed from it, by its flow progreſs, by pain in the lumbar region at the commencement of the diſceaſe, by the patient allowing the tumor to be handled freely, by fluctuation being evident, by the tumor becoming flaccid when the patient is in an horizontal ſituation, and by the absence of all the ſymptoms by which hernia is diſtinguished. Both diſeaſes may occur at once ; but this is very rare, and a diſtinction is ſtill to be made.</p><p>It is diſcovered that this diſeaſe has, in general, been induced by conſiderable injury being done to the ſmall of the back or loins, either by twiſts, or ſevere bruiſes, or by ſudden expoſure to cold after the heat occaſioned by ſevere exerciſe, particularly in ſcrophulous habits. Were accidents of this nature immediately treated with that attention which their importance deferves, the diſeaſe might frequently be prevented.</p><p>In the treatment the ſtricteſt antiphlogiſtic regimen ought to be observed. Blood-letting ought immediately to be performed, by ſcarifying deeply and leeching the injured part : neither are bliſters, opiates, gentle purgatives, and other remedies uſeful in inflammations, to be neglected.</p><p>Authors have an idea that little advantage can be derived from laying open the abſceſs, on account of the great danger which may ensue from the admiſſion of air. Mr Benjamin Bell, however, is of an oppoſite opinion, and has always given vent to matter here as elſewhere, and no bad conſequences have been obſerved. The matter, when long lodged, has been found to deſtroy the ſoft parts and bones, and ſometimes to make its way into the cavity of the abdomen ; all of which might be prevented by an early evacuation. For this purpoſe a trocar ſhould be uſed, which was tried by Mr Beſt in one case with complete ſucceſs.</p><p>Some other caſes are lately narrated by authors, where, by the introduction of a ſeton, and drawing off the matter by slow degrees, and then by uſing compreſs, and ſometimes injections of gently irritating fluids, a cure has been performed in the courſe of a few months. If the caſe is doubtful, an opening ſhould be made with the knife in the ſame manner as in hernia. If the flow of matter continue conſiderable for the space of two or three weeks, injections <hi rend="italic">of</hi> a weak ſolution of ſaccharum ſaturni, lime water, or other gentle aſtringents, may be employed.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V. <hi rend="italic">Paronychia or Whitloe, and Chilblains.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Whitloe</hi> is a painful and inflammatory ſwelling at the extremities of the fingers under the nails, terminating in an effuſion of clear serum below the ſkin, which is ſometimes ſo acrid as to corrode the perioſteum, and render the bones carious. At other times the iflammation runs ſo high that the whole of the arm ſwells, particularly the lymphatics, and ſometimes even the glands in the axilla.</p><p>When this affection ariſes from external violence, the re-</p></body></text></TEI>
