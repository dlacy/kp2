<p><span class="font1">1898), a thoughtful study of the political geography of the Far East and its possible changes; “ La Perse ” (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">But. Soc.&nbsp;Neuchatelοise,</span><span class="font1"> 1899); “La Phénicie et les Phéniciens” (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ibid.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">1900); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">La Chine et la diplomatie européenne</span><span class="font1"> (“ L’Humanité&nbsp;nouvelle ” series, 1900); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">L'Enseignement de la géographie</span><span class="font1"> (Instit.&nbsp;Géograph. de Bruxelles, No. 5, 1901). Shortly before his death&nbsp;Reclus had completed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">L'Homme et la terre,</span><span class="font1"> in which he set the&nbsp;crown on his previous greater works by considering man in his&nbsp;development relative to geographical environment. Reclus&nbsp;died at Thourout, near Bruges, on the 4th of July 1905.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RECOGNIZANCE (from Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">recognoscere,</span><span class="font1"> to acknowledge), a term of English law usually employed to describe an obligation&nbsp;of record, entered into before some court or magistrate duly&nbsp;authorized, whereby the party bound acknowledges (recognizes)&nbsp;that he owes a personal debt to the Crown, with a defeasance,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> subject to a condition that the obligation to pay shall be&nbsp;avoided if he shall do some particular act—as if he shall appear&nbsp;at the assizes, keep the peace, or the h*ke. The system of taking&nbsp;recognizances in favour of the Crown at an early date super-seded the common law practice as to pledges and main-prize&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">re Nottingham Corporation,</span><span class="font1"> 1897, 2 Q.B. 502, 514).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">BIackstone's definition extends the term recognizance to bonds in favour of private persons. But at present it is rarely&nbsp;if ever used in this sense. Recognizances are now used almost&nbsp;solely with reference to criminal proceedings. In the Court of&nbsp;Chancery it was the practice to require recognizances from the&nbsp;guardian of a ward of court that the ward should not marry or&nbsp;leave the country with the privity of the guardian and without&nbsp;the leave of the court. The security given by a receiver&nbsp;appointed by the High Court is still in the form of a recognizance&nbsp;acknowledging a debt to named officers of the court, and securing&nbsp;it on the real and personal estate of the receiver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By an act of 1360 (34 Edw. III. c. 1), extended to Ireland by Poyning’s Act, and by the terms of the commission of the peace,&nbsp;justices of the peace have jurisdiction to cause to come before&nbsp;them or any one of them “ all those who to any one or more of&nbsp;our people concerning their bodies or the firing of their houses&nbsp;have used threats to find sufficient security for the peace or&nbsp;their good behaviour towards us and our people; and if they&nbsp;shall refuse to find such security, then there in our prisons until&nbsp;they shall find such security to cause to be safely kept.’’ The&nbsp;security taken is by recognizance of the party and his sureties,&nbsp;which can he forfeited on conviction of any offence which is&nbsp;a breach of the conditions of the recognizance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The procedure under the act of 1360 and the commission is usually described as exhibiting articles of the peace or swearing&nbsp;the peace. The High Court (King’s Bench Division) has the same&nbsp;power as justices in quarter sessions. This procedure is in practice&nbsp;superseded in England, so far as concerns courts of summary&nbsp;jurisdiction, by an equivalent but more modern procedure (42 &amp;&nbsp;43 Vict. c. 49, s. 25). Recognizances ordered under these enactments&nbsp;cannot be forfeited or as it is termed estreated without an order&nbsp;of court made upon proof of breach of the conditions, or of a&nbsp;conviction involving such breach. The procedure for estreats&nbsp;is governed by the Levy of Fines Acts 1822 and 1833, and by&nbsp;16 &amp; 17 Vict. c. 30, s. 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is also a general jurisdiction on conviction of misdemeanour to put the offender under recognizances to keep the peace and&nbsp;(or) be of good behaviour in addition to or in substitution for other&nbsp;punishment. This power is specifically applied by the Criminal&nbsp;Law Consolidation Acts of 1861 to all indictable misdemeanours&nbsp;punishable under these acts, and power is given to put persons&nbsp;convicted of any felony (not capital) punishable under the acts&nbsp;under a recognizance to keep the peace. On refusal to enter into&nbsp;recognizances as above, the court may order imprisonment for&nbsp;the refusal, limited in cases within the acts of 1861 to twelve&nbsp;months, and in cases within the act of 1879 to six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The recognizances above described may be described as a form of punishment or a judicial security for good conduct. Recognizances are, however, most used with reference to proceedings before&nbsp;conviction and judgment. In preliminary inquiries into indictable&nbsp;offences the inquiring justices take recognizances to ensure the&nbsp;attendance of the accused if liberated during any adjournment,&nbsp;and on committal for trial take the recognizances </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">the accused&nbsp;(if allowed bail) to attend the court of trial and take his trial, and&nbsp;of the prosecutor and the witnesses for the prosecution or defence&nbsp;to attend and prosecute or give evidence. As to witnesses this&nbsp;power was first given in 1554 (1 Ph. &amp; M. c. 13). The procedure&nbsp;is regulated by the Indictable Offences Act 1848 (11 &amp; 12 Vict.&nbsp;c. 42) as amended in 1867 (30 &amp; 31 Vict. c. 35) and the forms of&nbsp;recognizance are scheduled to the act of 1848. In the case of&nbsp;inquisitions of murder or manslaughter taken before a coroner a&nbsp;similar procedure is followed (Coroners Act 1887, 50 &amp; 51 Vict.&nbsp;c. 71, s. 5). The recognizances taken are returnable under penalty&nbsp;to the court of trial, which orders their estreat in the event of&nbsp;breach of the conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Similar powers as to the recognizances of persons prosecuted summarily are given by the Summary Jurisdiction Acts 1848 and&nbsp;1879; and in the event of appeals to quarter sessions or by special&nbsp;case to the High Court from courts of summary jurisdiction,&nbsp;recognizances or security are required from the appellant (42 &amp;&nbsp;43 Vict. c. 49, ss. 31, 33). On the transfer of indictments from&nbsp;inferior to superior courts recognizances to pay the costs on con-viction are also required (Crown Office Rules, 1906). In certain&nbsp;cases the police have authority to give bail to accused persons on&nbsp;their entering into a recognizance; and governors of prisons are&nbsp;allowed to release prisoners on bail on compliance with the terms&nbsp;on which it is allowed by the committing justices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By the Land Charges Act 1900 (63 &amp; 64 Vict. c. 26, s. 2 (1) a recognizance, whether obtained or entered into on behalf of the&nbsp;Crown or otherwise, does not operate as a charge on land or on&nbsp;any interest on land or on the unpaid purchase money for any&nbsp;land, unless a writ or order for the purpose of enforcing it is&nbsp;registered under s. 5 of the Land Charges, &amp;c., Act 1888 (51 &amp;&nbsp;52 Vict. c. 51) in the office of the Land Registry. This enactment&nbsp;is clearly applicable to receivers’ recognizances, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">supra;</span><span class="font0"> and on&nbsp;purchases of land search is made for registered recognizances and&nbsp;an official certificate can be obtained affirming or negativing the&nbsp;existence of a registered entry (Conveyancing Act 1882, s. 2).&nbsp;By s. 30 of the Bankruptcy Act 1883, a discharge in bankruptcy&nbsp;docs not release the debtor from debts on a recognizance unless&nbsp;the Treasury certifies in writing its consent to the discharge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By ss. 32, 34 of the Forgery Act 1861, it is made felony to forge recognizances, and to acknowledge them in the name of another&nbsp;without lawful authority is also felony (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. 98).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Scotland the place of recognizances is filled by cautions; a caution in “ law-burrows ” corresponds very nearly to a recognizance to keep the peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the United States recognizances are used for much the same purposes as in England.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(W. F. C.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RECONNAISSANCE (from Fr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">reconnaître,</span><span class="font1"> to recognize, Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">recognoscere),</span><span class="font1"> a military term denoting the reconnoitring&nbsp;or examination of an enemy’s position or movements, or of a&nbsp;tract of ground. Reconnaissances naturally vary indefinitely&nbsp;according to the purposes for which they are undertaken. A&nbsp;topographical reconnaissance is practically a survey of a tract&nbsp;of country or route, comprising both a map and a report as to&nbsp;its advantages and disadvantages. All reconnoitring work of&nbsp;this character is done by officers with small patrols, escorts or&nbsp;assistants. Strategical reconnaissance is performed by contact&nbsp;squadrons, which send forward officers and patrols to find the&nbsp;enemy. Tactical reconnaissance falls to the lot of troops of all&nbsp;arms, whether in contact with the enemy or for self-protection.&nbsp;A reconnaissance by a large force of all arms with the idea of&nbsp;provoking an enemy into showing his hand, if necessary by&nbsp;fighting, is called a reconnaissance in force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RECORD (Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">recordari,</span><span class="font1"> to recall to mind, from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cor,</span><span class="font1"> heart or mind), a verb or noun used in various senses, all derived&nbsp;from the original one of preserving something permanently in&nbsp;memory. In this article, however, we are only concerned&nbsp;with documentary records, or archives. In its accurate sense&nbsp;a record is a document regularly drawn up for a legal or ad-ministrative purpose and preserved in proper custody to per-petuate the memory of the transaction described in it; for the&nbsp;most part it forms a link in a complicated process, and unless&nbsp;the connexion between it and the other documents making&nbsp;up the process has been preserved, a portion of its meaning will&nbsp;have perished. The first care, therefore, of the custodian of&nbsp;records should be to preserve this connexion, where it exists.&nbsp;In the majority of countries a previous task awaits him; it&nbsp;has been his duty to collect and arrange his documents. There&nbsp;are few countries in which records have not passed through&nbsp;a period of neglect; each office of state has kept or rather&nbsp;neglected its own papers; each court of justice has been the&nbsp;keeper of its own records; the student has been paralysed&nbsp;by a multitude of repositories among which he vainly sought&nbsp;the documents he required. To this stage two systems have&nbsp;succeeded; the system of centralization both of records and of</span></p>
