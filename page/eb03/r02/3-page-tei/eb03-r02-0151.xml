The lands thus purchaſed by the public were to be divided among the poor oitizens; and cultivated either by themſelves or by freemen, who were upon the ſpot. Tiberius allowed every child of a family to hold 250 acres in his own name, over and above what was allowed to the father. Nothing could be more mild than this new law ; ſince by the Licinian he might have abſolutely deprived the rich of the lands they unjuſtly poſſeſſed, and made them accountable for the profits they had received from them during their long poſſeſſion. But the rich patricians could not ſo much as bear the name of the <hi rend="italic">Licinian law,</hi>  though thus qualified. Thoſe chiefly of the ſenatorial and equeſtrian order exclaimed againſt it, and were continually mounting the roſtra one after another, in order to diſe ſuade the people from accepting a law which, they ſaid, would raiſe diſturbances, that might prove more dangerous than the evils which Tiberius pretended to redreſs by the promulgation of it. Thus the zealous tribune was obliged day after day to enter the lifts with freſh adverſaries ; but he ever got the better of them both in point of eloquence and argument.</p><p>The people were charmed to hear him maintain the cauſe of the unfortunate with ſo much ſucceſs, and beſtowed on him the higheſt commendations. The rich therefore had recourſe to violence and calumny, in order to deſtroy, or at leaſt to diſcredit, the tribune. It is ſaid they hired aſſaſſins to diſpatch him ; but they could not put their wicked deſign in execution, Gracchus being always attended to and from the roſtra by a guard of about 4000 men. His adverſaries therefore endeavoured to ruin his reputation by the blackeſt calumnies. They gave out that be aimed at monarchy ; and publiſhed pretended plots laid for crowning him king. But the people, without giving ear to ſuch groundleſs reports, made it their whole buſineſs to encourage their tribune, who was hazarding both his life and reputation for their fakes.</p><p>When the day came on which this law was to be accepted or rejected by the people aſſembled in the co-mitium, Gracchus began with haranguing the mighty croud which an affair of ſuch importance had brought together both from the city and country. In his ſpeech he ſhowed the juſtice of the law with ſo much eloquence, made ſo moving a deſcription of the miſeries of the meaner ſort of people, and at the ſame time ſet forth in ſuch odious colours the uſurpation of the public lands, and the immenſe riches which the avarice and rapaciouſneſs of the great had raked together, that the people, tranſported with fury, demanded with loud cries the billets, that they might give their ſuffrages. Then Gracchus, finding the minds of the citizens in that warmth and emotion which was neceſſary for the ſucceſs of his deſign, ordered the law to be read.</p><p>But unluckily one of the tribunes, by name <hi rend="italic">Marcus 03avius Cacina,</hi>  who had always profeſſed a great friendſhip for Gracchus, having been gained over by the patricians, declared againſt the proceedings of his friend and colleague ; and pronounced the word which had been always awful in the mouth of a tribune of the people, <hi rend="italic">Veto,</hi>  “ I forbid it.” As Octavius was a man of an unblameable character, and had hitherto been very zealous ſor the publication” of the law, Gracchus waε greatly ſurpriſed at this unexpected oppoſition ſrom Ids friend. However, he kept his temper, and only deſired the people to aſſemble again the next day to hear their two tribunes, one in defence of, the other in oppoſition to, the law propoſed. The people met at the time appointed ; when Gracchus addreſſing himſelf to his colleague, conjured him by the mutual duties of their function, and by the bonds of their ancient friendſhip, not to oppoſe the good of the people, whom they were bound in honour to protect againſt the uſurpation of the great : nay, taking his colleague aſide, he addreſ-ſed him thus, “ Perhaps you are perſonally concerned to oppoſe this law ; if ſo, I mean, if you have more than the five hundred acres, I myſelf, poor as I am, engage to pay you in money what you will loſe in land.” But Octavius, either out of ſhame, or from a principle of honour, continued immoveable in the party he had embraced.</p><p>Gracchus therefore had recourſe to another expedient ; which was to ſuſpend all the magiſtrates in Rome from the execution of their offices. It was lawful for any tribune to take this ſtep, when the paſſing of the law which he propoſed was prevented by mere chicanery. After this, he aſſembled the people anew, and made a ſecond attempt to ſucceed in lus deſign. When all things were got ready for collecting the ſuffrages, the rich privately conveyed away the urns in which the tablets were kept. This kindled the tribune’s indignation, and the rage of the people. The comitium was like to become a field of battle, when two venerable ſenators, Manlius and Fulvius, very ſea-ſonably interpoſed ; and throwing themſelves at the tribune’s feet, prevailed upon him to ſubmit his law to the judgment of the conſcript fathers. This was making the ſenators judges in their own cauſe : but Gracchus thought the law ſo undeniably juſt, that he could not perſuade himſelf that they would reject it ; and if they did, he knew that the incenſed multitude would no longer keep any meaſures with them.</p><p>The ſenate, who wanted nothing but to gain time, affected delays, and came to no reſolution. There were indeed ſome among them, who, out of a principle of equity, were for paying ſome regard to the complaints of the tribune, and for ſacriſicing their own intereſt to the relief of the diſtreſſed. But the far greater part would not hear of any compoſition whatſoever. Hereupon Gracchus brought the affair anewbefore the people, and earneſtly intreated his colleague Octavius to drop his oppoſition, in compaſſion to the many unfortunate people for whom he interceded. He put him in mind of their ancient friendſhip, took him by the hand, and affectionately embraced him. But ſtill Octavius was inflexible. Hereupon Gracchus reſolved to deprive Octavius of his tribuneſhip, ſince he alone obſtinately withſtood the deſires of the whole body of ſo great a people. Having therefore aſſembled the people, he told them, that ſince his colleague and he were divided in opinion, and the republic ſuffered by their diviſion, it was the province of the tribes aſſembled in comitia to re-eſtabliſh concord among their tribunes. “ If the cauſe I maintain (ſaid he) be, in your opinion, unjuſt, I am ready to give up my ſeat in the college. On the contrary, if you judge me worthy of being continued in your fer∙ vice in this ſtation, deprive him of the tribuneſhip who alone obſtructs my wiſhes.
