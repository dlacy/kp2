<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Botrydium-plant, a process which is clearly a case of apogamy; and, further, the Botrydium-plant does not&nbsp;necessarily produce resting-spores, but may produce&nbsp;zoospores by which it is directly reproduced. In Coleo-chsete, too, alternation of generations is indicated. The&nbsp;oospore produces by division a small individual which is&nbsp;always asexual, giving rise to zoospores which likewise&nbsp;produce asexual individuals; this asexual reproduction&nbsp;may continue through a number of generations until&nbsp;eventually a sexual individual is developed. In Coleo-chsete it is only in the case of the sexually produced spore&nbsp;that the nature of the resulting organism is known; it&nbsp;always gives rise to an asexual form, whereas the asexually&nbsp;produced spores give rise to an individual which may be&nbsp;either sexual or asexual. In the Characese the oospore&nbsp;always gives rise to an imperfectly developed form, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">proembryo,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> which is to be regarded as the sporophore;&nbsp;however, it never produces spores, but gives rise to the&nbsp;sexual Chara-plant (oophore) vegetatively by budding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The study of the life-history of the Fungi is attended with considerable difficulty, partly on account of the fact&nbsp;that in many cases the development of the sexual organs&nbsp;is dependent upon a combination of external circumstances&nbsp;which may but rarely present itself, and partly on account&nbsp;of there being frequently a great difference in habit&nbsp;between the sexual and asexual forms of the same plant,&nbsp;a difference which is sometimes accentuated, in parasitic&nbsp;Fungi, by the occurrence of the two forms on different&nbsp;plants as hosts (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">keteroecism</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">). But there are Fungi in the&nbsp;life-history of which alternation of generations has been&nbsp;ascertained. Before entering upon an account of these, it&nbsp;must be stated that the term “sexually produced spore”&nbsp;will be applied not only to those the formation of which&nbsp;is known to be preceded by a sexual process, but also to&nbsp;those which are formed probably or actually without a&nbsp;sexual process—in a word, apogamously—but which may&nbsp;be considered, as pointed out above, to be homologous&nbsp;with those which are actually sexually produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mucor Mucedo</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Phycomyces nitens</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> among the Mucorini, for instance, the zygospore gives rise on&nbsp;germination to an imperfectly developed individual (promycelium) which is entirely asexual and produces spores;&nbsp;one of these spores, in turn, gives rise to an individual&nbsp;which produces spores asexually but may also bear sexual&nbsp;reproductive organs. Essentially the same life-history may&nbsp;be traced in certain Peronosporete (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Phytophthora omnivora,&nbsp;Pythium proliferum).</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> In these cases the form developed&nbsp;from the sexually produced spore is always asexual, whereas that derived from the asexually produced spore may be&nbsp;sexual, but it always produces spores asexually; hence&nbsp;there is not a strict alternation of an asexual ancl a sexual&nbsp;generation. In others the alternation is complete. In&nbsp;the Ustilaginese, for instance, the asexually produced&nbsp;spore gives rise to an imperfectly developed mycelium&nbsp;(</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">promycelium),</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> which is the sexual generation; it produces&nbsp;the sporidia, which conjugate in pairs, and from the&nbsp;product of conjugation springs the mycelium, which bears&nbsp;asexually produced spores.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Essentially the same life-history has been traced in some Ascomycetes and Uredineae. In Claviceps (Ascomy-cete) the sexually produced spore (ascospore) gives rise to&nbsp;an asexual form, long regarded as a distinct genus under&nbsp;the name of Sphacelia, from the spores of which the sexual&nbsp;form is reproduced. In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sclerotinia (Peziza) Fuckeliana&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Ascomycete), a similar regular alternation of generations&nbsp;occasionally but not always occurs; the ascospore may give&nbsp;rise to an asexual form, long known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Botrytis cinerea,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and when it does so the alternation of generations is&nbsp;complete; but it may give rise to another sexual generation, in which case no־ alternation takes place. In</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Polystigma (Ascomycete), the ascospore gives rise to a promycelium which bears sporidia, and these sporidia give&nbsp;rise to the sexual form. In Endophyllum (Uredineae) the&nbsp;life-history is precisely the same as that of Polystigma:&nbsp;the promycelium is the sporophore generation, the mycelium developed from the sporidium the oophore. In&nbsp;other Uredineae the life-history is slightly modified in&nbsp;that asexually produced spores of at least two kinds&nbsp;make their appearance. The sexually produced spore&nbsp;(oecidiospore) gives rise to a mycelium which, in Gymno-sporangium and Hemipuccinia, bears asexually produced&nbsp;spores, teleutospores; in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Puccinia Graminis</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> the formation&nbsp;of teleutospores is preceded by that of somewhat different&nbsp;spores, the uredospores; in any case the teleutospore&nbsp;gives rise, on germination, to a second asexual generation,&nbsp;the promycelium, which bears sporidia; from these the&nbsp;sexual secidium-bearing generation is developed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The rule that, in the alternation of generations, the alternate generations are developed from spores produced either sexually or asexually is not, however, without exceptions,&nbsp;for in some instances the one generation may spring vegetatively from the other without the intervention of a spore.&nbsp;This is brought about by the suppression either of the&nbsp;sexually produced spore or of the asexually produced spore;&nbsp;the former is an instance of apogamy, the latter of apospory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus in the apogamous Ferns mentioned above, the asexual generation (sporophore) is developed as a bud upon&nbsp;the sexual generation (oophore); and in Botrydium the&nbsp;gametangium which is the representative of the sexual&nbsp;generation may, instead of producing gametes, produce&nbsp;zoospores, in which case the new asexual individual is not&nbsp;developed from a sexually produced zygospore, but from&nbsp;an asexually produced zoospore. Similarly, in the apo-sporous Ferns and Mosses and in the Characese the oophore&nbsp;is developed as a bud from the sporophore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The alternation of generations may be also interfered with by a combination of apogamy and apospory. This is&nbsp;the case, namely, when one generation gives rise to its like&nbsp;by vegetative budding, sporophore to sporophore, oophore&nbsp;to oophore. For instance, when, as in the Phanerogams&nbsp;mentioned above (Coelebogyne, Funkia, Nothoscordum,&nbsp;Citrus), embryos are produced vegetatively from the tissue&nbsp;of the nucellus, that is, sporophore from sporophore, the&nbsp;typically intervening formation of spores, first, by the&nbsp;asexual method and, secondly, by the sexual method is&nbsp;suppressed. This is necessarily always the case among&nbsp;Phanerogams when one plant is produced vegetatively from&nbsp;anothei־. A striking instance of the same thing has been&nbsp;observed by Goebel in some species of Isoetes, in which an&nbsp;Isoetes plant was produced on the leaf in place of a&nbsp;sporangium. Similarly when oophore springs vegetatively&nbsp;from oophore, the typically intervening formation, first,&nbsp;of the sexually produced spore and, secondly, of the asexually produced spore, is suppressed. This occurs when, as&nbsp;mentioned above, a Moss-plant gives rise by budding or by&nbsp;means of gemma: to another Moss-plant, and when a Fern-prothallium gives rise to another by means of gemmte.</span></p>
