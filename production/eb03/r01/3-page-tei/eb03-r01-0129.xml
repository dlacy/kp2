But it remains to give abſolute meaſures of ſome individual impulſion ; to which, as to an unit, we may refer every other. And as it is by their preſſure that they become uſe-ful or hurtful, and they muſt be oppoſed by other preſſures, it becomes extremely convenient to compare them all with that preſſure with which we are moſt familiarly acquainted, the preſſure of gravity.</p><p>The manner in which the companion is made, is this, when a body advances in a fluid with a known velocity, it puts a known quantity of the fluid into motion (as is fuppoſed) with this velocity ; and this is done in a known time, we have only to examine what weight will put this quantity of fluid into the fume motion, by acting on it during the ſame time. This weight is conceived as equal to the reſiſtance. Thus, let us fuppoſe that a ſtream of water, moving at the rate of eight feet <hi rend="italic">per</hi>  ſecond, is perpendicularly obſtructed by a ſquare foot of folid furface held faſt in its place. Conceiving water to act in the manner of the hypothetical fluid now defcribed, and to be without elaſticity, the whole effect is the gradual annihilation of the motion of eight cubic feet of water mo-ving eight feet in a ſecond. And this is done in a ſe-cond of time. It is equivalent to the gradually put-ting eight cubic feet of' water into motion with this velocity ; and doing this by acting uniformly during a fecond. what weight is able to produce this effect ? The weight of eight feet of water, acting du-ring a ſecond on it, will, as is well known, give it the velocity of thirty-two feet <hi rend="italic">per</hi>  ſecond ; that is, four times greater. Therefore, the weight of the fourth part of eight cubic feet, that is, the weight of two cubic feet, acting during a ſecond, will do the fame thing, or the weight of a column of water whoſe bafe is a ſquare foot, and whofe height is two feet. This will not ©nly produce this effect in the ſame time with the impulſion of the ſolid body, but it will alſo do it by the fame degrees, as any one will clearly perceive, by at-tending to the gradual acceleration of the mafs of water urged by ∣ of its weight, and comparing this with the gradual production or extinction of motion in the fluid by the progreſs of the reſiſted ſurface.</p><p>Now it is well known that 8 cubic feet of water, by felling one foot, which it will do in one-fourth of a fe-¢ond, will acquire the velocity of eight feet per ſecond by its weight ; therefore the force which produces the feme effect in a whole ſecond is one-fourth of this. This ferce is therefore equal to the weight of a column of</p><lb/><p>water, whofe baſe is a ſquare foot, and whoſe height is two feet} that is, twice the height neceffary for acquiring the velocity of the motion by gravity. The con-cluſion is the ſame whatever be the ſurface that is reſiſted, whatever be the fluid that reſiſts, and whatever be the velocity of the motion. In this inductive and fa-miliar manner we learn, that <hi rend="italic">the direct impulfe or rfifi-ance of an unelajlicfiuid on any plane ſurface, is equal to the weight of </hi><hi rend="italic">a </hi><hi rend="italic">column of the fiuid having the furface for its bafe, and twice the fall necejfary for acquiring the velocity of the motion for its height :</hi>  and if the fluid is conſidered as elaſtic, the impulſe or refiſtance is twice as great. See Newt. <hi rend="italic">Princip.</hi>  B. II. prop. 35. and 38.</p><p>It now remains to compare this theory with experi-ment. Many have been made, both by Sir Ifaac Newton and by ſubſequent writers. It is much to be la-mented, that in a matter of fuch importance, both to the philofopher and to the artiſt, there is ſuch a difa-greement in the reſults with each other, we ſliall mention the experiments which ſeem to have been made with the greateſt judgment and care. Thoſe of Sir Iſaac Newton were chiefly made by the oſcillations of pendulums in water, and by the deſcent of balls both in water and in air. Many have been made by Mariotte <hi rend="italic">(Traité de Mouvement des Eaux).</hi>  Gravefande has pub-liihed, in his <hi rend="italic">Syfiem of Natural Philoſophy,</hi>  experiments made on the reſiſtance or impulſions on ſolids in thc midſt of a pipe or canal. They are extremely well con-trived, but are on ſo fmall a ſcale that they are of very little uſe. Daniel Bernoulli, and his pupil Profeffor Krafft, have publiſtied, in the <hi rend="italic">Comment. Acad. PetropοI </hi>experiments on the impulſe of a ſtream or vein of water from an oriſice or tube: Theſe are of great value. The Abbé Boffut has publiihed others of the ſame kind in his <hi rend="italic">Hydrodynamique.</hi>  Mr Robins has publiſhed, in life <hi rend="italic">New Principles of Gunnery,</hi>  many valuable experiments on the impulſe and reſiſtance of air. The Chev. de Borda, in the <hi rend="italic">Mem. Acad. Paris,</hi>  1763 and 1767, has given experiments on the reſiſtance of air and alſo of water, which are very intereſting. The moſt complete collection of experiments on the reſiſtance of water are thoſe made at the public expence by a committee of the academy of ſciences, conſiſting of the marquis de Condorcet, Mr d’Alembert, Abbe Boffut, and others. The Chev. de Buat, in his <hi rend="italic">Hydraulique,</hi>  has publiihed ſome</p><p>moſt curious and valuable experiments, where many im-portant circumftances are taken notice of, which had never been attended to before, and which give a view of the ſubject totally different from what is uſually ta-ken of it. Don George d’Ulloa, in his <hi rend="italic">Examine Ma-ritimo,</hi>  has alſo given ſome important experiments, ſimilar to thoſe adduced by Bougeur in his <hi rend="italic">Manœuvre des Vaiffeaux,</hi>  but leading to very different concluſions. All theſe ihould be conſulted by ſuch as would acquire a practical knowledge of this ſubject. we muſt content ourſelves with giving their moſt general and ſteady re-ſults. Such as,</p><p>I. It is very conſonant to experiment that the reſiſtances are proportional to the ſquares of the velocities, when the velocities of water do not exceed a few feet per ſecond, no ſenſible deviation is obferved. In very ſmall velocities the reſiſtances are fenſibly greater than in this proportion, and this exceſs is plainly owing to the viſcidity or imperfect fluidity of water.
