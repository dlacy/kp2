In the meanwhile, the burghers, who had but a day or two before raiſed a freſh uproar againſt the grand-maſter, under pretence that he was going to give them up a prey to an infidel who regarded neither oaths nor ſolemn treaties, perceiving their own danger, came now to deſire him to renew the negociations, and only begged the liberty of ſending one of their deputies along with his, to ſecure their intereſts in the capitulation. He readily conſented to it; but gave them a charge to ſhow the baſhaw Achmed the treaty formerly concluded between Bajazet and his predeceſſor d’Aubuſſon, in which the former had entailed a dreadful curſe on any of his ſuc-ceſſors that ſhould infringe it. This was done, in hopes that the ſhowing it to his maſter, who valued himſelf ſo much upon his ſtrict obſervance of his law, might produce ſome qualm in him which might lengthen the agreement, for they were ſtill as much in hopes of a ſuccour from Europe as he was in fear of it; but to their great ſurpriſe, Achmed had no ſooner peruſed than he tore it all in pieces, trampled it under his feet, and in a rage ordered them to be gone. The grand-maſter found no other reſource than to fend them back to him the next day; when that miniſter, who knew his matter’s impatience to have the affair concluded, quickly agreed with them upon the terms, which were in ſubſtance as follow:</p><p>I. That the churches ſhould not be profaned. 2. That the inhabitants ſhould not be forced to part with their children to be made janiſſaries. 3. That they ſhould enjoy the free exerciſe of their religion. 4. That they ſhould be free from taxes during five years. 5. That thoſe who had a mind to leave the iſland ſhould have free leave to do ſo. 6. That iſ the grand-maſter and his knights had not a ſufficient number of veſſels to tranſport themſelves and their effects into Candia, the ſultan ſhould ſupply that defect. 7. That they ſhould have 12 days allowed them, from the ſigning of the articles, to lend all their effects on board. 8. That they ſhould have the liberty of carrying away their relics, chalices, and other ſacred utenſils belonging to the great church of St John, together with all their ornaments and other effects. 9. That they ſhould likewiſe carry with them all the artillery with which they were wont to arm the galleys of the order- 10. That the iſlands belonging to it, together with the caſtle of St Peter, ſhould be delivered up to the Turks. 11. That, for the more eaſy execution of theſe articles, the Turkiſh army ſhould be removed at ſome miles diſtance from the capital. 12.That the aga of the janiſſaries, at the head of 4000 of his men, ſhould be allowed to go and take poſſeſſion of the place.</p><p>From this time the iſland of Rhodes has been ſub-ject to the Turks ; and, like other countries ſubject to that tyrannical yoke, has loſt its former importance. The air is good, and the foil fertile, but ill cultivated. The capital is ſurrounded with triple walls and double ditches, and is looked upon to be impregnable. It is inhabited by Turks and Jews; the Chi iſtians being obliged to occupy the ſuburbs, as not being allowed to ſtay in the town during the night. The town is ſitua-ted in E. Long. 28. 25. N.

The female calyx is quadripartite, and there is no corolla ; the nectaria are four; the piſtils four ; and there are four polyſpermous capſules. There are two ſpecies, the roſea and the minor : the firſt grows naturally in the clefts of the rocks and rugged mountains of Wales, Yorkſhire, and Weſt-moreland. It has a very thick fleſhy root, which when cut or bruiſed fends out an odour like roſes. It has thick ſucculent ſtalks, like thoſe of orpine, about nine inches long, cloſely garniſhed with thick ſucculent leaves indented at the top. The ſtalk is terminated by a chι-ſter of yellowiſh herbaceous flowers, which have an agreeable ſcent, but are of ſhort continuance. The ſe-cond ſort is a native of the Alps, and has purpliſh flowers which come out later than the former ; it is al-ſo of a ſmaller ſize. Both ſpecies are eaſily propagated by parting their roots ; and require a ſhady ſituation, and dry undunged foil. The fragrance of the firſt ſpecies, however, is greatly diminiſhed by cultivation.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Oil of RHODIUM.

There are ſeven ſpecies : the moſt remarkable of which are, I. The hirſutum, with naked hairy leaves, grows naturally on the Alps and ſeveral mountains of Italy. It is a low ſhrub, which ſeldom riſes two feet high, lending out many ligneous branches covered with a light-brown bark, garniſhed cloſely with oval ſpear-ſhaped leaves, fitting pretty cloſe to the branches. They are entire, having a great number of fine iron-coloured hairs on their edges and underſide. The flowers are produced in bunches at the end of the branches in May, having one funnel-ſhaped petal cut into five obtuſe ſeg-ments, and of a pale-red colour. They make a good ſhow, and are ſucceeded by oval capſules, containing ripe ſeeds in Auguſt. 2. The ferrugineum, with ſmooth leaves, hairy on their underſide, is a native of the Alps and Apennines. It riſes with a ſhrubby ſtalk near three feet high, ſending out many irregular branches covered with a purpliſh bark, and cloſely garniſhed with ſmooth ſpear-ſhaped entire leaves, whoſe borders are re-flexed backward ; the upper ſide is of a light lucid green, their under ſide of an iron colour. The flowers are produced at the ends of the branches, are funnel-ſhaped, cut into five ſegments, and of a pale roſe colour. Theſe plants are propagated by ſeeds ; but, being natives of barren rocky foils and cold ſituations, they do not thrive in gardens, and for want of their uſual covering of ſnow in the winter are often killed by froſt in this country. 3. The chamaeciſtus, or ciliated-leaved dwarf roſe-bay, is a low deciduous ſhrub, native of Mount Baldus, and near Saltzburg, in Germany. It</p></body></text></TEI>
