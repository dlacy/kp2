a department of the north-west of France, formed out of parts of the ancient province of the Upper Maine, of Anjou, and Perche-Gouet. It is bounded on the north by the department of the Ome, on the east by those of the Eure-Loire and the Loire-Cher, on the south by the Indre-Loire and Maine-Loire, and on the west by the Maine. It is nearly of a circular form, and extends to 1,398,600 acres, equal to 2185 square miles; and it is divided into four arrondissements, thirty-three cantons, and<pb facs="chi.28490931-1526160593_Page_707.jpf" xml:id="eb07-19-s01-0652"/>
394 communes. The population amounted, in 1836, to 466,888 persons. They are industrious, averse to changes,</p><p>and seldom leave the places of their birth, or alter the fashion of their dress. The surface is generally level, but on the north-eastern side there is a range of hills of very moderate height. The soil varies excessively, the department comprehending some of the best as well as some of the worst land in France. The north-west part consists of good cornland, and the north-east of valuable meadows ; but the south and south-west divisions are for the most part mere sandy heaths, yielding little or no corn, but in certain districts producing good wine. The chief river is that which gives its name to the department. It is navigable in the lower part, and before it joins the Loire receives the waters of thirty-six rivers and brooks. The products are the common domestic animals, with buck-wheat, maize, wheat, barley, hemp, flax, wine, honey, and various fruits. Nearly one tenth of the surface is covered with woods, which are commonly used as fuel. There are some mines of iron, and although none of them are very extensive, yet their great number enables the department to extract a sufficient quantity of that metal for its own consumption. The manufacturing industry is not considerable, being confined to hardware, paper, woollen cloths, leather, and the spinning of linen yarn. The capital is Le Mans, in the centre of the department, with a population, in the year 1836, of 23,164. It contains scarcely any other large towns.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
