        <p><span class="font1">that the growing feebleness exhibited by Volsci and Æqui was in some
                measure caused by the pressure upon their&nbsp;rear of the Sabellian clans which at
                this time established&nbsp;themselves near the Fucine Lake and along the course
                of&nbsp;the Liris.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">But in 390, only six years after the great victory over her ancient
                rival Veii, the Roman advance was for a&nbsp;moment checked by a disaster which
                threatened to alter&nbsp;the course of history in Italy, and which left a
                lasting&nbsp;impress on the Roman mind. In 391 a Celtic horde left&nbsp;their newly
                won lands on the Adriatic, and, crossing the&nbsp;Apennines into Etruria, laid siege
                to the Etruscan city&nbsp;of Clusium (Chiusi). Thence, provoked, it is said,
                by&nbsp;the conduct of the Roman ambassadors, who, forgetting&nbsp;their sacred
                character, had fought in the ranks of&nbsp;Clusium and slain a Celtic chief, the
                barbarians marched&nbsp;upon Rome. On July 18, 390 B.c., only a few miles
                from&nbsp;Rome, was fought the disastrous battle of the Allia. The&nbsp;defeat of
                the Romans was complete, and Rome lay at the&nbsp;ercy of her foe. But in
                characteristic fashion the Celts&nbsp;halted three days to enjoy the fruits of
                victory, and time&nbsp;was thus given to put the Capitol at least in a state
                of&nbsp;defence. The arrival of the barbarians was followed by&nbsp;the sack of the
                city, but the Capitol remained impregnable. For seven months they besieged it, and
                then in&nbsp;as sudden a fashion as they had come they disappeared.&nbsp;The Roman
                chroniclers explain their retreat in their own&nbsp;way, by the fortunate appearance
                of Camillus with the&nbsp;troops which he had collected, at the very moment
                when&nbsp;famine had forced the garrison on the Capitol to accept&nbsp;terms. More
                probably the news that their lands across&nbsp;the Apennines were threatened by the
                Veneti, coupled&nbsp;with the unaccustomed tedium of a long siege and
                the&nbsp;difficulty of obtaining supplies, inclined the Celts to accept&nbsp;readily
                a heavy ransom as the price of their withdrawal.&nbsp;But, whatever the reason, it
                is certain that they retreated,&nbsp;and, though during the next fifty years
                marauding bands&nbsp;appeared at intervals in the neighbourhood of Rome,
                and&nbsp;even once penetrated as far south as Campania (361-360),&nbsp;the Celts
                never obtained any footing in Italy outside the&nbsp;plains in the north which they
                had made their own.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Nor, in spite of the defeat on the Allia and the sack of the city,
                was Rome weakened except for the moment by&nbsp;the Celtic attack. The storm passed
                away as rapidly as&nbsp;it had come on. The city was hastily rebuilt, and
                Rome&nbsp;dismayed the enemies who hastened to take advantage of&nbsp;her
                misfortunes by her undiminished vigour. Her conquests in southern Etruria were
                successfully defended&nbsp;against repeated attacks from the Etruscans to the
                north.&nbsp;The creation in 387 of four new tribes (Stellatina,&nbsp;Sabatina,
                Tromentina, Arniensis) marked the final annexation of the territory of Veii and of
                the lands lying along&nbsp;the Tiber valley. A few years later Latin colonies
                were&nbsp;established at Sutrium and Nepete for the more effectual&nbsp;defence of
                the frontier, and finally, in 353, the subjugation of South Etruria was completed by
                the submission&nbsp;of Caere (Cervetri) and its partial incorporation with&nbsp;the
                Roman state as a “ municipium sine suffragio ”—the&nbsp;first, it is said, of its
                    kind.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>

                    against her old foes the&nbsp;Æqui and Volsci, and her old allies the Latins
                    and&nbsp;Hernicans. The Æqui indeed, already weakened by their&nbsp;long feud with
                Rome, and hard pressed by the Sabellian&nbsp;tribes in their rear, were easily dealt
                with, and after the&nbsp;campaign of 389 we have no further mention of an</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Æquian war until the last Æquian rising in 304. The Volsci, who in
                389 had advanced to Lanuvium, were met&nbsp;and utterly defeated by M. Furius
                Camillus, the conqueror of Veii, and this victory was followed up by
                the&nbsp;gradual subjugation to Rome of all the lowland country&nbsp;lying between
                the hills and the sea as far south as&nbsp;Tarracina. Latin colonies were
                established at Satricum&nbsp;(385), at Setia (379), and at Antium and Tarracina
                some&nbsp;time before 348. In 358 two fresh Roman tribes (Pomp-tina and Publilia)
                were formed in the same district.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Rome had now nothing more to fear from the foes who a century ago had
                threatened her very existence. The&nbsp;lowland country, of which she was the
                natural centre,&nbsp;from the Ciminian forest to Tarracina, was quiet,
                and&nbsp;within its limits Rome was by far the strongest power.&nbsp;But she had now
                to reckon with the old and faithful allies&nbsp;to whose loyal aid her present
                position was largely due.&nbsp;The Latins and Hernicans had suffered severely in
                the&nbsp;Æquian and Volscian wars; it is probable that not a few&nbsp;of the
                smaller communities included in the league had&nbsp;either been destroyed or been
                absorbed by larger states,&nbsp;and the independence of all alike was threatened by
                the&nbsp;growing power of Rome. The sack of Rome by the Celts&nbsp;gave them an
                opportunity of reasserting their independence, and we are consequently told that
                this disaster was&nbsp;immediately followed by the temporary dissolution of
                the&nbsp;confederacy, and this again a few years later by a series&nbsp;of actual
                conflicts between Rome and her former allies.&nbsp;Between 383 and 358 we hear of
                wars with Tibur, Prseneste,&nbsp;Tusculum, Lanuvium, Circeii, and the Hernici. But
                in&nbsp;all Rome was successful. In 382 Tusculum was fully&nbsp;incorporated with
                the Roman state by the bestowal of&nbsp;the full franchise@@<sup>3</sup>; in 358,
                according to both Livy and&nbsp;Polybius the old alliance was formally renewed
                with&nbsp;Latins and Hernicans. We cannot, however, be wrong&nbsp;in assuming that
                the position of the allies under the new&nbsp;league was far inferior to that
                accorded them by the treaty&nbsp;of Spurius Cassius.@@<sup>4</sup> Henceforth they
                were the subjects&nbsp;rather than the equals of Rome, a position which it
                is&nbsp;evident that they accepted much against their will, and&nbsp;from which they
                were yet to make one last effort to&nbsp;escape.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">We have now reached the close of the first stage in Rome’s advance
                towards supremacy in Italy. By 343&nbsp;</span><span class="font1"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font1"> she was already
                mistress both of the low country&nbsp;stretching from the Ciminian forest to
                Tarracina and&nbsp;Circeii and of the bordering highlands. Her own territory had
                largely increased. Across the Tiber the lands&nbsp;of Veii, Capena, and Caere were
                nearly all Roman, while&nbsp;in Latium she had carried her frontiers to Tusculum
                on&nbsp;the Alban range and to the southernmost limits of the&nbsp;Pomptine
                district. And this territory was protected by a&nbsp;circle of dependent allies and
                colonies reaching northward&nbsp;to Sutrium and Nepete, and southward to Sora on
                the&nbsp;upper Liris, and to Circeii on the coast. Already, too, she&nbsp;was
                beginning to be recognized as a power outside the&nbsp;limits of the Latin lowlands.
                The fame of the capture of&nbsp;Rome by the Celts had reached Athens, and her
                subsequent victories over marauding Celtic bands had given&nbsp;her prestige in
                South Italy as a bulwark against northern&nbsp;barbarians. In 354 she had formed her
                first connexions&nbsp;beyond the Liris by a treaty with the Samnites, and&nbsp;in
                348 followed a far more important treaty with the great&nbsp;maritime state of
                    Carthage.@@<sup>5</sup></span></p>
