<p><label>RONSARD</label>
(Peter de) was born at the caſtle of Poiſfoniere in Vendomoιs in 1524. He was deſeended of a noble family, and was educated at Paris in the college of Navarre. Academical purſuits not ſuiting his genius, he left college, and became page to the. duke of Orleans, who reſigned him to James Stuart, king of Scots, married to Magdalene of France. Ronſard continued in Scotland with King James upwards of two years, and afterwards went to Fiance, where he was employed by the duke of Orleans in ſeveral négociations. He accompanied Lazarus de Baiſ to the diet of Spires. Having from the converſation of this learned man imbibed a paſſion for the belles-lettres, he ſtudied the Greek language with Baif’s ſon under Dorat. It is reported of Ronſard, that his practice was to ſtudy till two o’clock in the morning ; and when he went to bed, to awaken Baif, who reſumed his place. The muſes poſſeſſed in' his eyes an infinity of charms ; and he cultivated them with ſuch ſucceſs, that he acquired the appellation of the <hi rend="italic">Prince of the Poets</hi> of his time. Henry II. Francis II. Charles IX. and Henry III. loaded him with favours. Having gained the firſt prize of the <hi rend="italic">Jeux Flocaux,</hi> they thought the reward promiſed below the merit of the work, and the reputation of the poet. The city of Toulouſe cauſed a Minerva of maſſy ſilver of conſiderable value to be made and ſent to him. This preſent was accompanied with a decree, declaring him <hi rend="italic">The French Poet,</hi> by way of diſtinction. Ronſard afterwards made a preſent of his Minerva to Henry II. and this monarch appeared as much elated with this mark of the poet’s eſteem for him, as the poet himſelf could have been had he received the preſent from his ſovereign. Mary, the beautiful and unfortunate queen of Scots, who was equally ſenſible of his merit with the Touloneſe, gave him a very rich ſet of table-plate, among which was a veſſel in the form of a roſe-buſh, repreſenting Mount Parnaſſus, on the top of which was a Pegaſus with this inſcription :</p><p><hi rend="italic">A Ronſard, Γ Apollon de la ſource des muſes.</hi></p><p>From the above two anecdotes of him may eaſily be inferred the reputation in which he was held, and which he continued to keep till Malherbe appeared. His works poſſeſs both invention and genius ; but his affectation of everywhere thruſting in his learning, and of forming words from the Greek, the Latin, and the different provincialiſrfts of France, has rendered his ver-ſification diſagreeable and often unintelligible.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Ronſard, dit Deſpréaux, par une autre méthode, Réglant tout, brouilla tout, jit uη art à la mode ;</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Ft toutefois long temps eut un heureux dejlin ;</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Mais ſa muſe, en François parlant Grec et Latin,</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Fit dans /’ age ſuivant, par un retour groteſque, Tomber de ſes grands mots le faße pedantejque.</hi></p><p>He wrote hymns, odes, a poem called the <hi rend="italic">Franciad,</hi> eclogues, epigrams,, ſonnets, &amp;c. In his odes he takes bombaſt for poetical raptures. He wiſhes to imitate Pindar ; and by labouring too much for lofty expreſſions, he lofes himſelf in a cloud of words. He is obſcure and harſh to the laſt degree : faults whieſh he might eaſily have avoided by ſtudying the works of Marot, who had before he wrote brought French poetry very near to perfection. “ Marotſe turn and ſtyle</p><p>of compoſition are ſuch (ſays Bruyere), that he ſeems to have written after Ronſard : there is hardly any difference, except in a few words, between Marot and us. Ronſard, and the authors his contemporaries, did more diſſervice than good to ſtyle : they checked its courſe in the advances it was making towards perfection, and had like to have prevented its ever attaining it. It is ſurpriſing that Marot, wlioſe works are ſo natural and eaſy, did not make Ronſard, who was fired with the ſtrong enthuſiaſm of poetry, a greater poet than either Ronſard or Marot.” But what could be expected from a man who had ſo little taſte, that he called Marot’s works ‘ a dunghill, from which rich grains of gold by indullrious working might be drawn ?’ As a ſpecimen of our author’s intolerable and ridiculous affectation of learning, which we have already cenſured, Boileau cites the following verſe of Ronſard to his miſtreſs : <hi rend="italic">Eßes-vouGpas mα jeιde entelechie? <hi rend="sup">i</hi></hi> are not you my only entelechia <hi rend="italic">V</hi> Now <hi rend="italic">entelechia</hi> is a word peculiar to the peripatetic philoſophy, the ſenſe of which does not appear to have ever been fixed. Hermalaus Barbarus is ſaid to have had recourſe to the devil, in order to know the meaning of this new term uſed by Ariſtotle ; but he did-not gain the information he wanted, the devil, probably to conceal his ignorance, ſpeaking in a faint and whiſpering ſort of voice. What could Ronſard’s miſtreſs therefore, or even Ronſard himſelſ, know of it ; and, what can excuſe in a man of real genius the low affectation of uſing a learned term, becauſe in truth nobody could underſtand it. He has, however, ſome pieces not deſtitute of real merit ; and there are perhaps few effuſions of the French muſe' more truly poetical than his <hi rend="italic">Four Seaſons of the Tear,</hi> where a moſt fertile imagination diſplays all its riches.</p><p>Ronſard, though it is doubtful whether he ever was in orders, held ſeveral benefices in commendam; and he died at Saint-Coſme-les-Tours, one of theſe, December 27. 1585, being then 61 years of age. He appeared more ridiculous as a man than as a poet : he was particularly vain. He talked of nothing but his family and his alliances with crowned heads. In his panegyrics, which he addreſſes to himſelf without any ceremony, he has the vanity to pretend,, that from <hi rend="italic">Ronſard</hi> is derived the word <hi rend="italic">Roſignol,</hi> to denote both a muſician and a poet together- He was born the year after the defeat of Francis I. before Pavia: “Juſt as heaven (ſaid he) wiſhed to indemnify France for the loſſes it had ſuſtained at that place.” He bluſhed not to tell of his intrigues. All the ladies ſought after him ; but he never ſaid that any of them gave him a denial of their favours. His immoderate indulgence in pleaſure, joined to his literary labours, ſerved to haften his old age. In his 50th year he was weak and valetudinarv, and ſubject to attacks off the gout. He retained his wit, "his vivacity, and his readineſs at poetic compoſition, to. his laſt moments. Like all thoſe who aſpire after public eſteem, he had a great number of admirers and ſome enemies. Though Melin de Saint-Gelais railed at him. continually, Rabelais was the perſon whom he moſt dreaded. He took always care to inform himſelf where that jovial rector of Meudon went, that he mi Tit not be found in the ſame place with him. It is reported, that Voltaire acted a ſimilar part with regard to Peron*, of whoſe extemporary ſallies and <hi rend="italic">bon mots</hi> he was much</p>
