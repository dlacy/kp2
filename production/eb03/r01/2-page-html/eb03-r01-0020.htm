<p><span class="font1">to run along the ſurface. &quot;water rails (ſays Buffon) are ſeen near the perennial fountains during the greateſt. part&nbsp;of the winter, yet like the land rails they haye their regular migrations. They paſs Malta in the ſpring and au-tumn. The Viſcount de Querhoent ſaw ſome 50 leagues&nbsp;off the coaſts of Portugal on the 17th of April. They&nbsp;were ſo fatigued, that they ſuffered themielves to be&nbsp;caught by the hand (a). Gmelin found theie birds in&nbsp;the countries watered, by the Don. ,Belon calls them&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">black rails,</span><span class="font1"> and ſays they are everywhere known, and&nbsp;that the ſpecies is more numerous than the red rail, or&nbsp;land rail. * The fleſh of the water rail is not ſo delicate&nbsp;as that of the land rail, and has even a marſhy taſte,&nbsp;nearly like that of the gallinule. It continues the&nbsp;whole year in England.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">2. The porzana, or gallinule, is not very frequent&nbsp;in Great Britain, and is ſaid to be migratory. Inhabits the ſides of ſmall ſtreams, concealing itſelf among&nbsp;the buſhes. Its length is nine inches ; its breadth, 15 ;&nbsp;its weight, four ounces five drachms. d he head is&nbsp;brown, fpotted with black ; the neck a deep olive, fpotted with white : the feathers of the back are black&nbsp;next their ſhafts, then olive-coloured, and edged with&nbsp;white ; the ſcapulars are olive, finely marked with two&nbsp;ſmall white ſpots on each web : the legs of a yellowiſh&nbsp;green. &quot; Its habits (fays Buffon) wild, its inſtinct ſtupid,&nbsp;the porzana is unſuſceptible of education, nor is even ca-pable of being tamed, we raiſed one, however, which&nbsp;lived a whole ſummer on crumbs of bread and hemp-feed;&nbsp;when by itſelf, it kept conſtantly in a large bowl of v ater ;&nbsp;but if a perſon entered the cloſet where it was ſhut, it&nbsp;ran to conceal itſelf in a ſmall dark corner, without vent-ing cries or murmurs. In the ſtate ot liberty, hυweveι,&nbsp;it has a ſharp piercing voice, much like the ſcieam. of&nbsp;a young bud of prey ; and though it has no propenſity&nbsp;to ſociety, as ſoon as one cries, another repeats the&nbsp;found, which is thus conveyed through all the ιeit in&nbsp;the diſtrict. Like all the rails, it is ſo obſtinately averſe&nbsp;to riſe, that the ſportſman often ſeizes it with his hand,&nbsp;or fells it with a ſtick. If it finds a buſh in its retreat,&nbsp;it climbs upon it, and from the top of its aſylum beholds tlie dogs bruſhing along in iault : this habit is&nbsp;common to it and to the water-rail. It dives, ſwims,&nbsp;and even fwims under water, when hard puſhed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot; Theſe birds diiappear in the depth of winter, but re-turn early in the ſpring ; and even in the month of Fe-bruary they are common in ſome provinces of 1 rance and Italy. Ί heir fleſh is delicate, and much eſteemed :&nbsp;thoſe, in particular, which are caught in the 1 ice-fields&nbsp;in Piedmont are very fat, and of an exquiſite flavour.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">3. The crex, crake, or corn-crek, has been ſuppoſed&nbsp;by ſome to be the ſame with the water-rail, and that it&nbsp;differs only by a change of colour at a certain ſeaſon of&nbsp;the year : this error is owing to inattention to their&nbsp;characters and nature, both which differ entirely. The&nbsp;bill of tfiis ſpecies is ſhort, ſtrong, and thick ; formed&nbsp;exactly like that of the water-lien, and makes a generi-cal diſtinction. It never frequents watery places ; but&nbsp;is always found among corn, graſs, broom, or furze. It&nbsp;quits the kingdom before winter; but the water-ιail en-</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">dures our ſharpeſt ſeaſons. They agree in their averſion to flight ; and the legs, which are remarkably long for the ſize of the bird, hang down whilſt they are on&nbsp;the wing ; they truſt their ſafety to their _ ſwiftneſs on&nbsp;foot, and ſeldom are ſprung a ſecond time but with&nbsp;great difficulty. The land rail lays from 12 to 20 eggs,-of a dull white colour, marked with a few yellow.ſpots;&nbsp;notwithſtanding this, they are very numerous in thιs-kingdom. 1 heir note is very ſingular; and like the&nbsp;quail, it is decoyed into a net by the imitation of its&nbsp;cry, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">crëk crek crek,</span><span class="font1"> by rubbing hard the blade of a knife&nbsp;on an indented bone. Moſt of the names given in different languages to this bird-rare evidently formed to&nbsp;imitate this ſingular cry. Hence Iurner and ſome&nbsp;other naturaliſts have ſuppoſed it to be the crex of the ancients ; but that term appears to have been applied by&nbsp;the ancients to other birds. Philus gives the crex the&nbsp;epithet of ∕⅛α&lt;Juτ)Efθf, or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">βuggi(h∙winged,</span><span class="font1"> which would&nbsp;indeed fuit the land-rail. Ariſtophanes repreſents it as&nbsp;migrating from Libya: Ariſtotle ſays that it is quand»&nbsp;ſome, which may have been attributed to it from the&nbsp;analogy to the quail ; but he adds, that the crex ιeeks&nbsp;to deſtroy the neſts of the blackbird, which cannot apply to the rail, ſince it never inhabits the woods. Still&nbsp;leſs is the crex of Herodotus </span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font1">rail, for he compares its&nbsp;ſize to that of the ibis, which is ten times larger. The&nbsp;avoſet, too, and the teal, have ſometimes the cry </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">crex,&nbsp;crex :</span><span class="font1"> and the bird which Belon heard repeating that&nbsp;cry on the banks of the Nile is, according to his account,&nbsp;a ſpecies of godwit. Thus the found repreſented by the&nbsp;word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">erex,</span><span class="font1"> belonging to ſeveral ſpecies, is not ſufficiently&nbsp;preciſe to diſtinguiſh the land-rail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">They are in greateſt plenty in Angleſea, where they appear about the 20th of April, ſuppoſed to paſs over&nbsp;from Ireland, where they abound ; at their firſt aπival&nbsp;it is common to ſhoot ſeven or eight in a morning.&nbsp;They are found in moſt of the Hebrides·, and the Drk-neys. Οη their arrival they are very lean, weighing only&nbsp;ſix ounces ; but before they leave this iſland, grow ſo fat&nbsp;as to weigh above eight. The feathers on the crown of&nbsp;the head and hind-part of the neck are black, edged&nbsp;with bay colour : the coverts of the wings of the ſame&nbsp;colour, but not ſpotted ; the tail is ſhort, and of a deep&nbsp;bay : the belly white ; the legs aſh-coloured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RALPH (James), a late ingenious hiſtorical and political writer, was born, we know not when or where,&nbsp;being ſirſt known as a ſchoolmaſter in Philadelphia in&nbsp;North America. He came to England about the be-ginning of the reign of George I. and wrote ſome things&nbsp;in the dramatic way, which were not received with great&nbsp;applauſe ; but though he did not ſucceed as a poet, he&nbsp;was a very ingenious proſe-writer. He wrote A Hiſtory of England, commencing with the Stuarts, which&nbsp;is much eſteemed ; as were his political eſſays and pamphlets, ſome of which were looked upon as mafter-pιeces&gt;&nbsp;His laſt publication, The Caſe of Authors by Profeſſion,&nbsp;is an excellent and entertaining performance. He died&nbsp;in 1762.</span></p>
