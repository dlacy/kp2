<p><label>ROLLER</label>
a very beautiful bird so called from its way of occasionally rolling or turning over in its flight, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> Gesner in 1555 said that the bird was thus called, and for this reason, near Strasburg, but the name seems not to be generally used in Germany, where the bird is commonly called <hi rend="italic">Rake,</hi> apparently from its harsh note. The French have kept the name <hi rend="italic">Rollier.</hi> It is a curious fact that the Roller, notwithstanding its occurrence in the Levant, cannot be identified with any species mentioned by Aristotle. </note> somewhat after the fashion of a Tumbler-Pigeon. It is the <hi rend="italic">Coracias garruius</hi> of ornithology, and is widely though not very numerously spread over Europe and Western Asia in summer, breeding so far to the northward as the middle of Sweden, but retiring to winter in Africa. It occurs almost every year in some part or other of the British Islands, from Cornwall to the Shetlands, while it has visited Ireland several times, and is even recorded from St. Kilda. But it is only as a wanderer that it comes hither, since there is no evidence of its having ever attempted to breed in Great Britain ; and indeed its conspicuous appearance—for it is nearly as big as a Daw and very brightly coloured—would forbid its being ever allowed to escape the gun of the always ready murderers of stray birds. Except the back, scapulars, and tertials, which are bright reddish-brown, the plumage of both sexes is almost entirely blue—of various shades, from pale turquoise to dark ultra-marine—tinted in parts with green. The bird seems to be purely insectivorous. The genus <hi rend="italic">Coracias,</hi> for a long while placed by systematists among the Crows, has really no affinity whatever to them, and is now properly considered to belong to the heterogeneous group of Birds in this work called <hi rend="italic">Pixariæ</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">(Ornithology, vol. xviii. p. 41), in which</hi></p><p>it forms the type of the Family <hi rend="italic">Coraciidæ·,</hi> and its alliance to the Bee-eaters, <hi rend="italic">Meropidæ,</hi> and King-fishers (vol. xiv. p. 81), <hi rend="italic">Alcedinidæ,</hi> is very evident. Some eight other species of the genus have been recognized, one of which, <hi rend="italic">C. leuco-cephalus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">C. abyssinus,</hi> is said to have occurred in Scotland. India has two species, <hi rend="italic">C. indiens</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C. affînis,</hi> of which thousands upon thousands are annually destroyed to supply the demand for gaudy feathers to bedizen ladies’ dresses. One species, <hi rend="italic">C. temmincki,</hi> seems to be peculiar to Celebes and the neighbouring islands, but otherwise the rest are natives of the Ethiopian or Indian Regions. Allied to <hi rend="italic">Coracias</hi> is the genus <hi rend="italic">Eurystomus</hi> with some half dozen species, of similar distribution, but one of them, <hi rend="italic">E. jιacificus,</hi> has a wider range, for it inhabits Australia and reaches Tasmania. Madagascar has four or five very remarkable forms which have often been considered to belong to the Family <hi rend="italic">Coraciidæ</hi> ; and, according to Professor A. Milne-Edwards, no doubt should exist on that point. Yet if any may be entertained it is in regard to one of them, <hi rend="italic">Lepto-somus discolor,</hi> which on account of its zygodactylous feet some authorities place among the <hi rend="italic">Cuculidæ,</hi> while others have considered it the type of a distinct Family <hi rend="italic">Lepto-somatidæ.</hi> The genera <hi rend="italic">Brachypteraxias</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Atelornis</hi> present fewer structural differences from the Rollers, and perhaps may be rightly placed with them ; but the species of the latter have long tarsi, and are believed to be of terrestrial habit, which Rollers generally certainly are not. These very curious and in some respects very interesting forms, which are peculiar to Madagascar, are admirably described and illustrated by a series of twenty plates in the great work of MM. Grandidier and A. Milne-Edwards on that island <hi rend="italic">(Oiseaux,</hi> pp. 223-250), while the whole Family <hi rend="italic">Coraciidæ</hi> is the subject of a monograph by Mr Dresser, as a companion volume to his monograph on the <hi rend="italic">∖∣ PPCiiuπPρ</hi> I A "N" I</p>
