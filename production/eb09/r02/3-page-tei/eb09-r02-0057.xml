This last retains a mediæval character, λvith narrow tortuous streets and high tile-roofed houses often enclosing large storehouses within their thick walls. Reval has more interesting antiquities than any other town of the Russian Baltic provinces. The old church of St Nicholas, built in 1317, contains many antiquities of the old Catholic times and old German paintings, of which a Dance of Death is especially worthy of notice. It contains also the graves of Holstein Beck and of the Duc de Croy, who was denied burial for his debts, and whose mummy, dressed in velvet and fine lace, was exposed until 1862. The “Domkirche” contains many interesting shields, as also the graves of the circumnavigator Krusenstern, of Pontus-de-la-Gardie, Henry Matthias, Karl Horn, &lt;kc. The church of St Olai, first erected in 1240, and often rebuilt, was completed in 1840 in Gothic style; it has a bell tower 429 feet high. The oldest church is the Esthonian, built in 1219. Water is brought from Lake Järväkylä by an aqueduct. The pleasant situation of the town, surrounded by beautiful parks, attracts in summer thousands of people for sea-bathing.</p><p>The population of Reval has increased rapidly since it has been connected by rail with St Petersburg and with Baltic Port, 30 miles distant; it reached 50,490 in 1881, against 27,325 in 1867, of whom one-third are Germans, the remainder Esthonians, with a few Russians and Jews. Nearly 15,000 inhabitants belong to the Greek Church. The manufactures are not important, but trade grows steadily. In Ï882 the exports (grain, spirits, &amp;c.) were £1,746,244, the imports (coal, iron, chemicals, Ac.) £6,858,247. In 1882 Reval was visited by 589 foreign ships (291,450 tons), mostly English, German, and Scandinavian, and by 802 coasters (103,000 tons). It has regular steam communication with St Petersburg, Helsingfors, Königsberg, ιfcc.</p><p>The high Silurian crag now known as Domberg was early occupied by an Esthonian fort, Lindanissa. In 1219 or 1233 the Danish king Waldemar II. erected there a strong castle and founded the first church of the Holy Ghost. In 1228 the castle was taken by the Livonian knights, but nine years later it returned to the Danes. About the same time Lübeck and Bremen merchants settled there under the protection of the castle, and their settlement soon became an important seaport of the Hanseatic League. It was fortified early in the 14th century, and in 1343 sustained the siege of the revolted Esthonians. Waldemar III. sold Reval and Esthonia to the Livonian knighthood for 19,000 silver marks, and the town belonged to the knighthood till its dissolution in 1561, when Esthonia and Reval surrendered to the Swedish king Erik XVI. A great conflagration in 1433, the pestilence of 1532, the bombardment by the Danes in 1569, and still more the Russo-Livonian War, broke down its formerly wealthy trade. The Russians not only devastated the neighbouring country but also besieged Reval twice, in 1570 and 1577. It was still, however, an important fortress, the forts and walls having been enlarged and fortified by the Swedes. In 1710 the commander Patkull surrendered it to Peter I., who immediately began there the erection of a military port for his Baltic fleet. The successors of Peter I. continued to fortify the access to Reval from the sea, large works being undertaken especially in the first part of the present century. During the Crimean War the suburb Reperbahn, situated on a low slip of coast, was destroyed in view of a possible landing of the allies.</p><p>REVELATION, Book of. The book of the New Testament called “ Revelation of John ” <hi rend="italic">(Άποκάλυψις ‰amv) </hi>so long passed for the most obscure and difficult document of early Christianity that scholars hesitated to apply to it the historico-critical method of investigation. Since this hesitation has been overcome, it appears that the matter of the book is neither obscure nor mysterious, although many special points still remain to be cleared up. Without being paradoxical we may affirm that the Apocalypse is the most intelligible book in the New Testament, because its author had not the individuality and originality of Paul or of the author of the Fourth Gospel, and because historically we can trace and comprehend its author’s position much better than we can, for instance, the theology of Paul. But all interpretations not strictly historical must bo excluded. The ethico-spiritualistic, rationalistic, and dogmatic explanations, such as were first attempted by the Alexandrine theologians, are fatal to the understanding of the book, as are also the explanations drawn from church history which were first put forward by mediæval sects. To see with Hengstenberg “ demagogy ” in “ Gog and Magog” (xx. 8), to identify “Apollyon” (ix. 11) with “ Napoleon,” or in antichrist to detect the emperor or the pope or Mohammed or Luther or Calvin—these interpretations are not a bit worse than those which turn the book into a compendium of morality or dogma wherein is set forth by means of imagery and allegories the triumph of virtue over vice or of orthodoxy over heterodoxy. The justification of the interpretation which explains the book entirely in the light of the historical circumstances attending its origin and of the views current amongst primitive Christians follows, above all, from observing that as a literary production the Revelation of John is by no means unique, but belongs to a class of literature (comp. Apocalyptic Literature, vol. ii. p. 174) which then had a very wide currency amongst the Jews, and the numerous remains of which even the most orthodox theologians do not hesitate to interpret by the help of the history of the time. The apocalyptic literature, in the strict sense of the word, began with the Jews in the 2d century b.c. ; in fact it developed as an aftergrowth of the prophetical literature, from which it differs less in kind than in degree. For more than three centuries it had sought to revive the drooping spirit of the people by revelations of a near future when, after one last dreadful onset of a hostile world, Jahveh would appear in the person of His Messiah to conquer the nations of the world and to set up the kingdom of glory for Israel. Every time the political situation culminated in a crisis for the people of God the apocalypses appeared stirring up the believers. In spirit, form, plan, and execution they closely resembled each other. Their differences sprang only from the difference of the times, for every apocalyptic writer painted the final catastrophe after the model of the catastrophes of his day, only on a vaster scale and with deepened shadows. They all spoke in riddles ; that is, by means of images, symbols, mystic numbers, forms of animals, &lt;fec., they half concealed Λvhat they meant to reveal. The reasons for this procedure are not far to seek :— ( 1 ) clearness and distinctness would have been too profane— only the mysterious appears divine ; (2) it was often dangerous to be too distinct. The apocalyptic writers in their works supplied revelations on all possible questions, but their principal achievement was regularly a revelation of the history of mankind in general and of the people of Israel in particular ; in their most essential features the apocalypses are political manifestos. It is characteristic of all apocalypses that they pass under false names, being attributed to the most celebrated persons of the Old Testament; thus we still possess apocalypses under the names of Daniel, Baruch, Ezra, Moses, and Enoch. These old heroes are represented in the respective w<hi rend="sup">r</hi>orks as speaking in the first person, and exhorting their readers to await with hope and patience the coming of the Messiah. Usually the apocalypse contains a brief summary of history, beginning with the time of the nominal and ending with that of the actual author, in order that the reader, perceiving how much of the prophecy has already been fulfilled to the letter, may look w<hi rend="sup">τ</hi>ith assured confidence for the fulfilment of the rest. Lastly, the particular features in the descriptions as well as the images and metaphors are usually borrowed in great measure from the books of the old prophets, but they are painted in</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
