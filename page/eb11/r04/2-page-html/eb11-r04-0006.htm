            <p><span class="font1">ROMAN LAW.@@<sup>1</sup> The term “ Roman law ” is indefinite and
                    ambiguous, being used in more than one sense. First, in a&nbsp;wide sense, it
                    comprehends the totality of the laws of the Roman&nbsp;state, which were
                    observed by its subjects during about thirteen&nbsp;centuries, from Romulus to
                    Justinian. In a second and stricter&nbsp;meaning it indicates the law as
                    consolidated by Justinian or,&nbsp;in other words, the law contained in the
                    </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Corpus Juris
                    Civilis,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">which is the name that has been given
                    since the 16th century&nbsp;to Justinian’s legislative works as a whole, and
                    distinguishes&nbsp;them from the </span><span class="font1"
                    style="font-style:italic;">Corpus Juris Canonici.</span><span class="font1"> In
                    this acceptation it&nbsp;is equivalent to, and is often called, “ civil law ” as
                    contrasted&nbsp;with canon law. In a third and loose sense Roman law em-braces,
                    in addition to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Corpus
                    Juris,</span><span class="font1"> the interpretations of it&nbsp;after Justinian
                    by medieval and modern courts, jurists and&nbsp;commentators adapting it to the
                    customs and laws of their&nbsp;own countries and times. The German expression,
                    for example,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                    >modernes</span><span class="font1"> (or </span><span class="font1"
                    style="font-style:italic;">heutiges) römisches Recht,</span><span class="font1">
                    indicates the Roman&nbsp;law as it was applied in Germany in modern times.
                    Such&nbsp;medieval and modern interpretation, however, is also sometimes
                    expressed, in English usage at least, by the term “civil&nbsp;law ” as
                    contrasted with native or common law; writers in&nbsp;this field being usually
                    styled civilians rather than Romanists.&nbsp;It is to the Roman law in the first
                    of the above-mentioned three&nbsp;significations that the present article is
                    devoted.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">To give a proper sketch of Roman law it must be treated
                    historically. Nearly all systems of positive law are the product&nbsp;more or
                    less of an historic development, but the Roman&nbsp;has this great advantage
                    over other systems, that it&nbsp;was at all times a homogeneous body complete in
                    itself.&nbsp;For the Romans were comparatively little indebted to&nbsp;other
                    peoples for their jurisprudence, and, when they&nbsp;</span><span class="font0"
                    >did </span><span class="font1">borrow legal ideas and institutions from others,
                    they&nbsp;generally transformed or modified these in adapting them to&nbsp;their
                    own native system, so that they became substantially&nbsp;Roman. Moreover, the
                    various stages of progress of the law&nbsp;from its genesis to its maturity and
                    ultimate consolidation can&nbsp;be traced in unbroken continuity. Beginning in
                    753 </span><span class="font0">B.C., </span><span class="font1"
                    >the&nbsp;traditionally accepted date of the foundation of Rome, it continued
                    its course till the death of Justinian in a.d. 565. Allowing for the first three
                    centuries being without historic evidence,&nbsp;we have at least an
                    authenticated evolution of about 1000 years.&nbsp;Of no other system of law,
                    ancient or modern, can anything</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">like the same thing be said.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">As to the proper method of historic treatment there have been
                    different opinions. Without going into these, it is enough&nbsp;to say that the
                    subject may be treated from two sides, viz.&nbsp;on the one side in relation to
                    the external sources of the law,&nbsp;including therein the political and social
                    conditions and the&nbsp;various constitutional changes at different periods
                    affecting&nbsp;the development of the law, as well as the modes in which
                    the&nbsp;law manifested itself and the legal literature from which
                    our&nbsp;knowledge of it is derived; on the other side it may be treated&nbsp;in
                    relation to the several departments or institutions of the law&nbsp;in view of
                    their development or changes through time or circumstance, such as marriage,
                    slavery, property, and so forth. This&nbsp;corresponds to what Leibnitz
                    described as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                    >external</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1"
                    style="font-style:italic;">internal&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">history
                    respectively, terms which are now rather out of vogue.&nbsp;Of course it is
                    possible to treat the historic sources of the law,&nbsp;constitutional and
                    literary, independently of the doctrines, and&nbsp;this is now often done; but
                    unless both are discussed the field&nbsp;of Roman law is not covered. Both the
                    external and the</span></p></div><br clear="all" /><div>
            <p><span class="font1">internal history, however, may be treated together or in a
                    measure interwoven, and it is in this way that the subject&nbsp;is treated in
                    the following pages. But constitutional events&nbsp;affecting the law are only
                    noticed very summarily, details&nbsp;about these being given in separate
                    articles. </span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">Modern writers on the history of the Roman law have as a rule,
                    for the purpose of systematic treatment, divided the&nbsp;subject into definite
                    historic periods. Gibbon, in the&nbsp;44th chapter of his </span><span
                    class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Decline and Fall of the
                    Roman&nbsp;Empire,</span><span class="font1"> seems to have been the first to
                    suggest this&nbsp;mode of treatment, though the particular periods
                    of&nbsp;division he selected (being based on an artificial symmetry
                    of&nbsp;about three hundred years each) are not satisfactory.@@<sup>2 </sup>In
                    the&nbsp;present article, the division made by Muirhead in his article in
                    the&nbsp;9th edition of this Encyclopaedia into five historic epochs
                    has&nbsp;been left unaltered. These are: (1) the regal period; (2) the

                    fundamental division between these or, indeed, between&nbsp;any historic epochs.
                    The law is a unity: it has its roots in the&nbsp;past and grows with the nation
                    itself, and, like it, decays; there&nbsp;is no break in its continuity. The
                    division is made merely&nbsp;for convenient treatment of the subject.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">It must be kept in view that our knowledge of Roman customs and
                    laws earlier than the XII. Tables and even for some time&nbsp;after them cannot
                    be based on strict historical evidence; it is&nbsp;almost entirely traditional
                    and conjectural, and different writers&nbsp;will take different views according
                    to the relative value they&nbsp;place upon this or that piece of presumptive
                    evidence.</span></p>

                    Indo-European communities in their&nbsp;essential characteristics. The tribe,
                    the clan, the family, the&nbsp;individual: each of these appears in course of
                    development&nbsp;prior to the XII. Tables. Putting aside much of the
                    traditional&nbsp;accounts of Livy, Dionysius, and other ancient
                    historians,&nbsp;regarding the foundation of Rome and its early political
                    and&nbsp;social life, as mythical, modern critical historians are none
                    the&nbsp;less agreed that in the earliest period of their existence as
                    a&nbsp;settled community the Romans were subjected to the government of a king
                    </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(rex),</span><span

            <p><span class="font1">It used to be a somewhat common opinion that the primitive Romans
                    were a sort of amalgam of three different races—Latin,&nbsp;Sabine and Etruscan.
                    This opinion is mainly based upon the&nbsp;tradition that the state was
                    originally formed by a union of&nbsp;three tribes called Ramnes, Tities and
                    Luceres; the Ramnes&nbsp;being of the Latin race, the Tities of the Sabine and
                    the Luceres&nbsp;of the Etruscan. Attempts have even been made to find in
                    the&nbsp;Roman laws and institutions traces of the influence of each of
                    these&nbsp;races, and especially of the first two—</span><span class="font1"
