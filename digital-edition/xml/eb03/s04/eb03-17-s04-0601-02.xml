that property of matter, or body, by which it excludes all other bodies from the place which itſelf poſſeſſes ; and as it would be absurd to ſuppoſe that two bodies could poſſeſs one and the ſame place at the ſame time, it follows, that the ſofteſt bodies are equally ſolid with the hardeſt. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Metaphysics,</hi> n⁰ 44. 173. &amp; c.</p><p>Among geometricians, the ſolidity of a body denotes the quantity or ſpace contained in it, and is called alſo its ſolid content.</p><p>The iolidity of a cube, priſm, cylinder, or parallelo- piped, is had by multiplying its baſis into its height. The ſolidity of a pyramid or cone is had by mul</p><p>tiplying either the whole baſe into a third part of the height, or the whole height into a third part of the baſe.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
