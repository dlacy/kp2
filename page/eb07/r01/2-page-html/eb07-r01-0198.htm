<p><span class="font0">tribes of three or four hundred, are wonderfully gentle (I speak as an eye-witness), and appear to have some kind of&nbsp; order and subordination in their little sylvan polity.” The&nbsp;festival of Rhama is held on the 9th day of the new moon&nbsp;of Chaitra, on which the war of Lanca is dramatically represented, concluding with an exhibition of the fire-ordeal,&nbsp;by which the victor’s wife Sita gave proof of her connubial&nbsp;fidelity. Amongst the Hindus there is a variety of very&nbsp;fine dramas of great antiquity on the story of Rhama.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are three Rhamas mentioned in the Indian mythology, who, together with Krishna, the darling god of the Indian women, are described as youths of perfect beauty.&nbsp;The third Rhama is Krishna’s elder brother, and is considered as the eighth Avatar, invested with an emanation of&nbsp;his divine radiance. Like all the Avatars, Rhama is painted with gemmed Ethiopian or Parthian coronets ; with rays&nbsp;encircling his head, jewels in his ears, two necklaces, one&nbsp;straight and one pendant on his bosom, with dropping gems;&nbsp;garlands of well-disposed many-coloured flowers, or collars&nbsp;of pearls, hanging down below his waist ; loose mantles of&nbsp;golden tissue or dyed silk, embroidered on the hems with&nbsp;flowers, elegantly thrown over one shoulder, and folded like&nbsp;ribbands across the breast ; with bracelets, two on one arm&nbsp;and on each wrist. All the Avatars are naked to the waist,&nbsp;and uniformly with dark azure flesh, in allusion probably to&nbsp;the tint of that primordial fluid on which Narayan moved&nbsp;in the beginning of time ; but their skirts are bright yellow, the colour of the curious pericarpium in the centre of&nbsp;the water-lily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RHAPSODI, Rhapsodists, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Antiquity,</span><span class="font0"> persons who made a business of singing pieces of Homer’s poems. It&nbsp;has been said that the rhapsodi were clothed in red when&nbsp;they sung the Iliad, and in blue when they sung the Odyssey. They performed on the theatres, and sometimes strove&nbsp;for prizes in contests of poetry and singing. After the two&nbsp;antagonists had finished their parts, the two pieces or papers they were written in were soon joined together again,&nbsp;and hence the name, from gαπrω, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">suo,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ωin, canticum.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">But there seem to have been other rhapsodi of more antiquity than these people, who composed heroic poems or&nbsp;songs in praise of heroes and great men, and sung their own&nbsp;compositions from town to town for a livelihood ; of which&nbsp;profession Homer himself is said to have been a member.&nbsp;See Homer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RHAPSODOMANCY, an ancient kind of divination performed by pitching on a passage of a poet at hazard, and&nbsp;reckoning on it as a prediction of what was to come to pass.&nbsp;There were various ways of practising this rhapsodomancy.&nbsp;Sometimes they wrote several papers or sentences of a poet&nbsp;on so many pieces of wood, paper, or the like, shook them&nbsp;together in an urn, and drew out one, which was accounted&nbsp;the lot. Sometimes they cast dice on a table whereon&nbsp;verses were written, and that upon which the die lodged&nbsp;contained the prediction. A third manner was by opening&nbsp;a book, and pitching on some verse at first sight. This&nbsp;method they particularly called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sortes Prœnestinœ ;</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;afterwards, according to the poet, made use of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sortes Homerica, sortes Virgilianœ,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RHAPSODY, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Antiquity,</span><span class="font0"> a discourse in verse, sung or rehearsed by a rhapsodist. Others conceive rhapsody&nbsp;to signify a collection of verses, especially those of Homer,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">which having been a long time dispersed in pieces and fragments, were at length by Pisistratus’s order digested into books called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rhapsodies,</span><span class="font0"> from gατrω, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">suo,</span><span class="font0"> and ωoιj, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">canticum.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Hence, amongst modems, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rhapsody</span><span class="font0"> is also used for an assemblage of passages, thoughts, and authorities, raked together from divers authors, to compose some new<sup>τ</sup> piece.</span></p>

It comprehends ten cantons, divided into 181 communes, and in&nbsp;1836 contained 123,919 inhabitants. The capital is the city&nbsp;of the same name. It stands in a pleasing district on the&nbsp;river Bisle. It is surrounded with walls, not for defence, but&nbsp;converted into agreeable promenades. It is a city of well-built and large houses, some open places, but in general of&nbsp;narrow streets, well paved. The chief object of attention&nbsp;is the fine Gothic cathedral, in which the kings of France&nbsp;during many generations were crowned. It is 450 feet in&nbsp;length, ninety-five in breadth, and 110 in height. The&nbsp;portico is beautiful, and the interior presents a magnificence in its architecture, which is so combined with simplicity as to produce a wonderful impression on the spectator. It suffered injury during the revolution, but the damages have in some degree been repaired. The palace of&nbsp;the archbishop and some other ecclesiastical buildings are very&nbsp;fine. This city has a lyceum, three hospitals, and 38,359&nbsp;inhabitants, who carry on considerable manufactures of woollen goods of various kinds, and in shawls of mixed substances. It is also a place of commerce, and is the principal mart for champagne wine. Long. 3.56.3. E. Lat. 49.&nbsp;15. 16. N.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RHETORES, amongst the Athenians, were ten in number, elected by lot to plead public causes in the senate-house or assembly. For every cause in which they were retained they received a drachm out of the public money.&nbsp;They were sometimes called Suwjyofw, and their fee τo&nbsp;2uwiχojlxev. No man was admitted to this office until he&nbsp;was forty years of age, though others say thirty. Valour&nbsp;in war, filial piety to parents, prudence in their affairs, frugality and temperance, were necessary qualifications for&nbsp;this office, and every candidate underwent an examination&nbsp;concerning these virtues previous to the election. The&nbsp;orators at Rome were not unlike the Athenian </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rhetores.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RHETORIANS, a sect of heretics in Egypt, so denominated from Rhetorius, their leader. The distinguishing tenet of this heresiarch, as represented by Philastrius, was,&nbsp;that he approved of all the heresies before him, and taught&nbsp;that they were all in the right.</span></p>
