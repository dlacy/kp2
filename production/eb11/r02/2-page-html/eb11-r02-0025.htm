<p><span class="font1">painful path of conversion. The heretic, having developed powers of rational choice, perceives his heresy, to wit, his want&nbsp;of adaptation to the moral environment, and turning round&nbsp;embraces the new faith that is the passport to survival.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Far otherwise is it with man at the stage of savagery—the stage of petty groups pursuing a self-centred life of inveterate&nbsp;custom, in an isolation almost as complete as if they were&nbsp;marooned on separate atolls of the ocean. Progress, or at all&nbsp;events change, does indeed take place, though very slowly,&nbsp;since the most primitive savage we know of has his portion of&nbsp;human intelligence, looks after and before, nay, in regard to the&nbsp;pressing needs of every day shows a quite remarkable shrewdness&nbsp;and resource. Speaking generally, however, we must pronounce&nbsp;him unprogressive, since, on the whole, unreflective in regard to&nbsp;his ends. It is the price that must be paid for social discreteness&nbsp;and incoherency. And the consequence of this atomism is&nbsp;not what a careless thinker might be led to assume, extreme&nbsp;diversity, but, on the contrary, extreme homogeneity of culture.&nbsp;It has been found unworkable, for instance, to classify the&nbsp;religions of really primitive peoples under a plurality of heads,&nbsp;as becomes necessary the moment that the presence of a distinctive basis of linked ideas testifies to the individuality of&nbsp;this or that type of higher creed. Primitive religions are like&nbsp;so many similar beads on a string; and the concern of the&nbsp;student of comparative religion is at this stage mainly with the&nbsp;nature of the string, to wit, the common conditions of soul and&nbsp;society that make, say, totemism, or taboo, very much the same&nbsp;thing all the savage world over, when we seek to penetrate to&nbsp;its essence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This fundamental homogeneity of primitive culture, however, must not be made the excuse for a treatment at the hands of&nbsp;psychology and sociology that dispenses with the study of details&nbsp;and trusts to an a priori method. By all means let universal&nbsp;characterization be attempted—we are about to attempt one&nbsp;here, though well aware of the difficulty in the present state&nbsp;of our knowledge—but they must at least model themselves&nbsp;on the composite photograph rather than the impressionist&nbsp;sketch. An enormous mass of material, mostly quite in the raw,&nbsp;awaits reduction to order on the part of anthropological theorists,&nbsp;as yet a small and ill-supported body of enthusiasts. Under&nbsp;these circumstances it would be premature to expect agreement&nbsp;as to results. In regard to method, however, there is little&nbsp;difference of opinion. Thus, whereas the popular writer abounds&nbsp;in wide generalizations on the subject of primitive humanity,&nbsp;the expert has hitherto for the most part deliberately restricted&nbsp;himself to departmental investigations. Religion, for example,&nbsp;seems altogether too vast a theme for him to embark on, and he&nbsp;usually prefers to deal with some single element or aspect.&nbsp;Again, origins attract the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">litterateur;</span><span class="font1"> he revels in describing&nbsp;the transition from the pre-religious to the religious era. But&nbsp;the expert, confining his attention to the known savage, finds&nbsp;him already religious, nay, encumbered with religious survivals&nbsp;of all kinds; for him, then, it suffices to describe things as they&nbsp;now are, or as they were in the comparatively recent fore-time.&nbsp;Lastly, there are many who, being competent in some other&nbsp;branch of science, but having small acquaintance with the&nbsp;scientific study of human culture, are inclined to explain&nbsp;primitive ideas and institutions from without, namely by&nbsp;reference to various external conditions of the mental life of&nbsp;peoples, such as race, climate, food-supply and so on. The&nbsp;anthropological expert, on the other hand, insists on making the&nbsp;primitive point of view itself the be-all and end-all of his investigations. The inwardness of savage religion—the meaning it&nbsp;has for those who practise it—constitutes its essence and&nbsp;meaning likewise for him, who after all is a man and a brother,&nbsp;not one who stands really outside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In what follows, then, we shall, indeed, venture to present a wholesale appreciation of the religious idea as it is for primitive&nbsp;man in general; but our account will respect the modern&nbsp;anthropological method that bids the student keep closely to&nbsp;the actualities of the religious experience of savages, as it can&nbsp;with reasonable accuracy be gathered from what they do and say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We have sought to render only the spirit of primitive religion, keeping clear both of technicalities and of departmental investigations. These are left to the separate articles bearing on the&nbsp;subject. There the reader will find the most solid results of&nbsp;recent anthropological research. Here is he merely offered a&nbsp;flimsy thread that, we hope, may guide him through the maze of&nbsp;facts, but alas! is only too likely to break off short in his hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Definition of Primitive Religion.—</span><span class="font1">In dealing with a development of culture that has no immutable essence, but is intrinsically fluid and changing, definition must consist either in a definition&nbsp;of type, which indicates prevalence of relevant resemblance as&nbsp;between specimens more or less divergent, or in exterior definition, which delimits the field of inquiry by laying down within&nbsp;what extreme limits this divergence holds. Amongst the&nbsp;numberless definitions of religion that have been suggested,&nbsp;those that have been most frequently adopted for working&nbsp;purposes by anthropologists are Tylor’s and Frazer’s. Dr E. B.&nbsp;Tylor in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Primitive Culture</span><span class="font1"> (i), i. 424, proposes as a “ minimum&nbsp;definition” of religion “ the belief in spiritual beings.” Objections to this definition on the score of incompleteness are, firstly,&nbsp;that, bcsides belief, practice must be reckoned with (since, as&nbsp;Dr W. Robertson Smith has made clear in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lectures on the&nbsp;Religion of the Semites,</span><span class="font1"> 18 sqq., ritual is in fact primary for&nbsp;primitive religion, whilst dogma and myth are secondary);&nbsp;secondly, that the outlook of such belief and practice is not&nbsp;exclusively towards the spiritual, unless this term be widened&nbsp;until it mean next to nothing, but is likewise towards the quasimaterial, as will be shown presently. The merit of this definition, on the other hand, lies in its bilateral form, which calls&nbsp;attention to the need of characterizing both the religious&nbsp;attitude and the religious object to which the former has reference. The same form appears in Dr J. G. Frazer’s definition in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Bough</span><span class="font1"> (2nd ed.), i. 63. He understands by religion&nbsp;“ a propitiation or conciliation of powers superior to man which&nbsp;are believed to direct and control the course of nature and of&nbsp;human life.” He goes on to explain that by “ powers” he means&nbsp;“ conscious or personal agents.” It is also to be noted that he&nbsp;is here definitely opposing religion to magic, which he holds&nbsp;to be based on the (implicit) assumption “ that the course of&nbsp;nature is determined, not by the passions or caprice of personal&nbsp;beings, but by the operation of immutable laws acting mechanically.” His definition improves on Tylor’s in so far as it makes&nbsp;worship integral to the religious attitude. By regarding the&nbsp;object of religion as necessarily personal, however, he is led to&nbsp;exclude much that the primitive man undoubtedly treats with&nbsp;awe and respect as exerting a mystic effect on his life. Further,&nbsp;in maintaining that the powers recognized by religion are always&nbsp;superior to man, he leaves unclassed a host of practices that&nbsp;display a bargaining, or even a hectoring, spirit on the part of&nbsp;those addressing them (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Prayer).</span><span class="font1"> Threatening or beating&nbsp;a fetish cannot be brought under the head of magic, even if&nbsp;we adopt Frazer’s principle </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(op. cit.</span><span class="font1"> i. 64) that to constrain or&nbsp;coerce a personal being is to treat him as an inanimate agent;&nbsp;for such a principle is quite inapplicable to cases of mere terrorism,&nbsp;whilst it may be doubted if it even renders the sense of the&nbsp;savage magician’s typical notion of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">modus operandi,</span><span class="font1"> viz.&nbsp;as the bringing to bear of a greater </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mana</span><span class="font1"> or psychic influence&nbsp;(see below) on what has less, and must therefore do as it is&nbsp;bidden. Such definitions, then, are to be accepted; if at all, as&nbsp;definitions of type, selective designations of leading but not&nbsp;strictly universal features. An encyclopaedic account, however,&nbsp;should rest rather on an exterior definition which can serve as it&nbsp;were to pigeon-hole the whole mass of significant facts. Such&nbsp;an exterior definition is suggested by Mr E. Crawley in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Tree of Life,</span><span class="font1"> 209, where he points out that “ neither the Greek&nbsp;nor the Latin language has any comprehensive term for religion,&nbsp;except in the one </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lepa,</span><span class="font1"> and in the other </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sacra,</span><span class="font1"> words which&nbsp;are equivalent to ‘sacred.’ No other term covers the whole&nbsp;of religious phenomena, and a survey of the complex details&nbsp;of various worships results in showing that no other conception&nbsp;will comprise the whole body of religious facts.” It may be&nbsp;added that we have here no generalization imported from a</span></p>
