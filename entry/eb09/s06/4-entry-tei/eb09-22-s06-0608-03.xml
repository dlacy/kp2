<hi rend="smallcaps">Johann Friedrich, Count</hi> (1737— 1772), Danish statesman, was of German extraction, and was born August 5, 1737, at Halle, where his father Adam Struensee, of some eminence as a hymn writer, was pastor. He graduated M.D. at Halle in 1756, and obtained the office of physician to the town of Altona through the influence of his father, who had removed thither. On account, however, of a change in his religious views he quarrelled with his father, and for some time he led an unsettled life, until in 1768 he was appointed personal physician to the young king, Christian VII. of Denmark, whom he accompanied on a tour through England, France, Holland, and Germany. The influence he exercised over the almost imbecile king awakened at first the jealousy of the queen, Caroline Matilda, a daughter of George II., but, having had occasion to attend her for a severe malady, he won her complete confidence also, and became equally the favourite of both. When therefore in 1770 he was appointed master of requests, he virtually took the government of the kingdom into his own hands, and on the 20th September the council of state was superseded. Though acting as an absolutist, his sympathies were democratic, and he used his position to promote the general benefit of the people and to curb the influence of the nobility. The extent of his reforms, and the suddenness with which they were introduced, had all the practical effect of a revolution. They included the enfranchisement of the peasants, complete religious toleration, the abolition of commercial restrictions, the reorganization of the army, and the introduction of examinations for public offices. His reforms were received with consternation, and a conspiracy was entered into to effect his overthrow. The queen dowager persuaded Christian VII. that Struensee was carrying on an intrigue with the queen, and had entered into a plot to assassinate him, in order that he might rule as regent. He and his friend Count Brandt were consequently arrested on 20th February 1772. The attempt to prove that he had been unfaithful in his duty as minister to the king failed, but he did not deny the <hi rend="italic">liaison</hi> with the queen, and he and Count Brandt were both beheaded and quartered on the 28th April (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Denmark,</hi> vol. vii. p. 87).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> Carl Gustav Struensee von Carlsbach, elder brother of Johann Friedrich, born at Halle 18th August 1735, attained high eminence in the service of Prussia. He was ennobled in 1789, became minister of finance and president of the excise department in 1791, and died at Berlin 17th October 1804. </note></p><p>See <hi rend="italic">Leben und Begebenheiten der Grafen Struensee und Brandt,</hi> 1772; <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of an Unfortunate Queen,</hi> London, 1776 ; Host, <hi rend="italic">Struensee og hans Ministerium,</hi> Copenhagen, 1824 ; Jenssen-Tusch, <hi rend="italic">Lie Verschwörung gegen die Königin Karoline Mathilde und die Grafen Struensee und Brandt, nach bisher tingedrückten Originalacten,</hi> Leipsic, 1864; Wraxall, <hi rend="italic">Life and Times of Queen Caroline,</hi> 1864 ; K.
