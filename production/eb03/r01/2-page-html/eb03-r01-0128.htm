<p><span class="font3">fecti¢n of the plane (which </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">we have ealled </span><span class="font3">its baſe), perpendicular to the direction of the ſtream. In AC&nbsp;produced, take any leαgth CG; and on CG deſcribe&nbsp;the ſemicircle CHG, and complete the rectangle&nbsp;BCGO. Through any point p of the curve draw&nbsp;ED parallel to AC, and meeting BC and Ο G in Q_&nbsp;and P- Let DF touch the curve in D, and draw&nbsp;the chord GH parallel to DF, aud HKM perpendi-cular to CG, meeting ED in M. Suppoſe this to&nbsp;be done for every point of the curve ADB, and let&nbsp;LMN be the curve which paffes through all the&nbsp;points of interſection of the parallels EDP and the&nbsp;correſponding perpendiculars HKM.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The effective impulſe on the curve furface ADB in the direction of the ſtream, is to its direct impnlſe on&nbsp;the baſe BC as the area BCNL is to the rectangle&nbsp;BCGO.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Draw </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">edqτnp</span><span class="font3"> parallel to EP and extremely near it. The arch D </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font3"> of the curve may be conceived as the&nbsp;ſection of an elementary plane, having the pofitioπ of&nbsp;the tangent DF. The angle EDF is the angle of in-cidence of the filament ED </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">d e.</span><span class="font3"> T his is equal to COH,&nbsp;becaufe ED, DF, are parallel to CG, GH ; and (be-caufe CHG is a ſemicircle) CH is perpendicular to&nbsp;GH. Aſſo CG : CH = CH : CK, and CG : CK ==&nbsp;CG’ : CH<sup>2</sup>, = rad.<sup>1</sup> : find, CGH, =rad.<sup>i</sup> : find in-cid. Therefore if CG, or its equal DP, repreſent the&nbsp;direct impulſe on the point Q^of tlie baſe, CK, or its&nbsp;equal QM, will repreſent the effective iιnpulfe on the&nbsp;point D of the curve. And thus, Q y ∕&gt; P will repreſent the direct impulſe of the filament on the element&nbsp;Q 7 of the baſe, and Qjr </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font3"> M will repreſent the effective impulſe of the ſame ſilament on the element&nbsp;D </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font3"> of the curve. Aud, as this is true of the whole&nbsp;curve ADB, the effective impulſe on the whole curve&nbsp;will be repreſented by the area BCNML ; and the direct impulſe on the baſe will be repreſented by the rectangle BCGO; and therefore the impulſe on the curve-furface is to the impulſe on the baſe as the area BLMNC&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font3">to the rectangle BOGC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is plain, from the conftruction, that if the tangent to the curve at A is perpendicular to AC, the point N&nbsp;will coincide with G. Alſo, if the tangent to the&nbsp;curve at B is parallel to AC, the point L will coincide&nbsp;with B.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">whenever, therefore, the curve ADB is fuch that an equation can be had to exhibit the general relation between the abſciffa AR and the ordinate DR, we ihall&nbsp;deduce an equation which exhibits the relation between&nbsp;the abfciſs CK and the ordinate KM of the curve&nbsp;LMN ; and this will give us the ratio of BLNC to&nbsp;BOGC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus, if the ſurface is that of a cylinder, fo that the curve BDA </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font3"> (fig. 5.), which receives the impulſe of&nbsp;the fluid, is a ſemicircle, make CG equal to AC, and&nbsp;conftruct the figure as before. The curve BMG is a&nbsp;parabola, whoſe axis is CG, whoſe vertex is G, and&nbsp;whoſe parameter is equal to CG. For it is plain, that&nbsp;CG = DC, and GH = </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">CQ<sub>λ</sub> = MK.</span><span class="font3"> And CG × GK&nbsp;= GH<sup>2</sup> — KM<sup>3</sup>. That is, the curve is ſueh, that the&nbsp;ſquare of the ordinate KM is equal to the rectangle of&nbsp;the abſciffa GK arfd a conftant line GC; and it is.there-</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">fore a </span><span class="font3">parabola whoſe vertex </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font3">G. Now, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">jt iβ well</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">known, that the parabolic area </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BMGC is two thirds </span><span class="font3">of the parallelogram BCGO. Therefore the impull'e&nbsp;on the quadrant ADB is two thirds of the impulfe on&nbsp;the baſe BC. The ſame may bc faid of the quadrant&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fodb</span><span class="font3"> and its baſe </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">c b.</span><span class="font3"> Therefore, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The impulſe on</span><span class="font3"> α </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">cylinder or half cylinder is t wo thirds of the direct impulfe on&nbsp;its tranfverſe plane through the axis ;</span><span class="font3"> or it is two thirds&nbsp;of the direct impulſe on one ſide of a parallelopiped of&nbsp;thc ſame breadth and height.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pk,op.</span><span class="font3"> VI,—If the body be a ſolid generated by </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">revolution of the figure BDAC (ſig. 4.) round the&nbsp;axis AC ; and if it be expoi¢d to the action of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">ſtream </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">q(</span><span class="font3"> ſiuid moving in the direction of the axis&nbsp;AC; then the effective impulſe in the direction of the&nbsp;ſtream is to the direct impulſe on its baſe, as the ſolid&nbsp;generated by the revolution of the figure BLMNC&nbsp;round the axis CN to the cylinder generated by th¢&nbsp;revolution of the rectangle BOGC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This ſcarcely needs â demonſtration. The figure</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ADBLMNA is a ſection of theſe folids by a plane paſſing through the axis ; and what has been demon-ſtrated of this ſection is true of every other, becauſe&nbsp;they are all equal and ſimilar. It 15 therefore true of&nbsp;the whole ſolids, and (their baſe) the circle generated&nbsp;by the revolution of BC round the axis AC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Hence we eaſily deduce, that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The impulfe on a ſphere is one half of the direct impulſe on its great circle, or on the&nbsp;bafe of a cylinder of equal diameter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For in this caſe the curve BMN (ſig. 5.) which generates the ſolid expreſſiug the impulſe on the ſphere is a parabola, and the ſolid is a parabolic conoid. Now&nbsp;this conoid is to the cylinder generated by the revolution of the rectangle BOGC round the axis CG, as&nbsp;the film of all the circles generated by the revolution&nbsp;of ordinates to the parabola fuch as KM, to the ſum&nbsp;of as many circles generated by the ordinates to the&nbsp;rectangle ſuch as K’ſ; or as the ſum of all the ſquares&nbsp;deſcribed on the ordinates KM to the ſum of as many&nbsp;ſquares deſcribed on the ordinates KT. Draw BG cut-ting MK in S. The ſquare on MK is to the ſquare on&nbsp;BC or TK as the abfcifla GK to the abſciffa GC (by the&nbsp;nature of the parabola), or as SK to BC ; becauſe SK&nbsp;and BCare refpectively equal toGK andGC. 1 herefore&nbsp;the ſum of all the ſquares on ordinates, ſuch as MK, is to&nbsp;the ſum of as many fquares on ordinates, ſuch as TK,&nbsp;as the ſum of all the lines SK to the film of as many&nbsp;lines TK ; that is, as the triangle BGC to the rectangle BOGC ; that is, as one to two : and therefore&nbsp;the impulſe on the ſphere is one half of the direct&nbsp;impulſe on its great circle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the ſame conſtruction we may very eafily deduce a very curious and ſeemingly uſeful truth, that of all conical bodies having the circle whoſe diameter is&nbsp;AB (fig. 2.) for its baſe, and FD for its height, the&nbsp;one which ſuſtains the ſmalleſt impulſe or meets with&nbsp;the ſmalleſt refiſtance is the fruſtum AGHB of a cone&nbsp;ACB ſo conſtructed, that EF being taken equal to&nbsp;ED, EA is equal to EC. This fruſtum, though more&nbsp;capacious than the cone AFB of the ſame height, will&nbsp;be leſs reſiſted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Alſo, if the ſolid generated by the revolution </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">BDAC (ſig. 4.) have its anterior part covered with </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">3&nbsp;fruſtum of a cone generated by the lines D </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a, a A,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
