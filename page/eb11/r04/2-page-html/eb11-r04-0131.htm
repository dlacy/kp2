<p><span class="font1">III. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Period</span><span class="font1"> I.: </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Principate,</span><span class="font1"> 27. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c-a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 284—(a) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Constitution of the Principate.—</span><span class="font1">The conqueror of Antonius at Actium, the great-nephew and heir of the dictator Caesar, was&nbsp;now summoned, by the general consent of a world wearied out&nbsp;with twenty years of war and anarchy,@@<sup>2</sup> to the task ol establishing a government which should as far as possible respect the&nbsp;forms and traditions of the Republic, without sacrificing that&nbsp;centralization of authority which experience had shown to be&nbsp;necessary for the integrity and stability of the Empire. It was&nbsp;a task for which Octavian was admirably fitted. To great&nbsp;administrative capacity and a quiet tenacity of purpose he&nbsp;united deliberate caution and unfailing tact; while his bourgeois&nbsp;birth@@<sup>3</sup> and genuinely Italian sympathies enabled him to win&nbsp;the confidence of the Roman community to an extent impossible for Caesar, with his dazzling pre-eminence of patrician&nbsp;descent, his daring disregard of forms and his cosmopolitan&nbsp;tastes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The new system which was formally inaugurated by Octavian in 28-27 <sup>B</sup>-<sup>c</sup>-@@<sup>4</sup> assumed the shape of a restoration of the republic&nbsp;under the leadership of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">princeps.@@<sup>5</sup></span><span class="font1"> Octavian voluntarily resigned the extraordinary powers which he had&nbsp;held since 43, and, to quote his own words, <sup>u</sup> handed&nbsp;over the republic to the control of the senate and&nbsp;people of Rome?’@@<sup>6</sup> The old constitutional machinery&nbsp;was once more set in motion; the senate, assembly and magistrates resumed their functions;@@<sup>7</sup> and Octavian himself was&nbsp;hailed as the “ restorer of the commonwealth and the champion&nbsp;of freedom?’@@<sup>8</sup> It was not so easy to determine what relation&nbsp;he himself, the actual master of the Roman world, should occupy&nbsp;towards this revived republic. His abdication, in any real&nbsp;sense of the word, would have simply thrown everything back&nbsp;into confusion. The interests of peace and order required that&nbsp;he should retain at least the substantial part of his authority;@@<sup>9&nbsp;</sup>and this object was in fact accomplished, and the rule of the&nbsp;emperors founded, in a manner which has no parallel in history.&nbsp;Any revival of the kingly title was out of the question, and&nbsp;Octavian himself expressly refused the dictatorship.@@<sup>10</sup> Nor was&nbsp;any new office created or any new official title invented for his&nbsp;benefit. But by senate and people he was invested according&nbsp;to the old constitutional forms with certain powers, as many&nbsp;citizens had been before him, and so took his place by the side&nbsp;of the lawfully appointed magistrates of the republic; —only,&nbsp;to mark his pre-eminent dignity, as the first of them all, the&nbsp;senate decreed that he should take as an additional cognomen&nbsp;that of “Augustus,”@@<sup>11</sup> while in common parlance he was henceforth styled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">princeps,</span><span class="font1"> a simple title of courtesy, familiar to republican usage, and conveying no other idea than that of a</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">recognized primacy and precedence over his fellow-citizens@@<sup>12 </sup>The ideal sketched by Cicero in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De RepMica,</span><span class="font1"> of a constitutional president of a free republic, was apparently realized;&nbsp;but it was only in appearance. For in fact the special prerogatives conferred upon Octavian gave him back in substance&nbsp;the autocratic authority he had resigned, and as between the&nbsp;restored republic and its new </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">princeps</span><span class="font1"> the balance of power was&nbsp;overwhelmingly on the side of the latter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Octavian had held the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">imperium</span><span class="font1"> since 43; in 33, it is true, the powers of the triumvirate had legally&nbsp;expired, but he had continued to wield his authority,&nbsp;as he himself puts it,@@<sup>13</sup> “ by universal consent.” In 27&nbsp;he received a formal grant of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">imperium</span><span class="font1"> from the&nbsp;senate and people for the term of ten years, and his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">prorincia&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">was defined as including all the provinces in which military&nbsp;authority was required and legions were stationed.@@<sup>14</sup> He was&nbsp;declared commander-in-chief of the Roman army, and granted&nbsp;the exclusive right of levying troops, of making war and peace,&nbsp;and of concluding treaties.<sup>@@15</sup> As consul, moreover, he not only&nbsp;continued fo be the chief magistrate of the state at home, but&nbsp;took precedence, in virtue of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">majus imperium,</span><span class="font1"> over the&nbsp;governors of the “ unarmed provinces,” which were still nominally under the control of the senate. Thus the so-called “ restoration of the republic ” was in essence the recognition by law&nbsp;of the personal supremacy of Octavian, or Augustus, as he&nbsp;must henceforth be called.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 23 an important change was made in the formal basis of Augustus’s authority. In that year he laid down the consulship which he had held each year since 31, and could&nbsp;therefore only exert his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">imperium pro consule,</span><span class="font1"> like&nbsp;the ordinary governor of a province. He lost his&nbsp;authority as chief magistrate in Rome and his&nbsp;precedence over the governors of senatorial provinces. To remedy these defects a series of extraordinary&nbsp;offices were pressed upon his acceptance; but he refused&nbsp;them all,@@<sup>16</sup> and caused a number of enactments to be&nbsp;passed which determined the character of the principate for&nbsp;the next three centuries.@@<sup>17</sup> Firstly, he was exempted from the&nbsp;disability attaching to the tenure of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">imperium</span><span class="font1"> by one who&nbsp;was not an actual magistrate, and permitted to retain and&nbsp;exercise it in Rome. Secondly, his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">imperium</span><span class="font1"> was declared&nbsp;to be equal with that of the consuls, and therefore superior to&nbsp;that of all other holders of that power. Thirdly, he was granted&nbsp;equal rights with the consuls of convening the senate and&nbsp;introducing business, of nominating candidates at elections,@@<sup>18&nbsp;</sup>and of issuing edicts.@@<sup>19</sup> Lastly, he was placed on a level wit h the&nbsp;consuls in outward rank. Twelve lictors were assigned to him&nbsp;and an official seat between those of the consuls themselves&nbsp;(Dio liv. 10).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thus the proconsular authority@@<sup>20</sup> was for the first time admitted within the walls of Rome; but Augustus was too&nbsp;cautious a statesman to proclaim openly the fact that&nbsp;the power which he wielded in the city was the same&nbsp;as that exercised in camps and provinces by a Roman&nbsp;military commander. Hence he sought for a title which should&nbsp;disguise the nature of his authority, and found it in the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
