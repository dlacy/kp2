Fortrose and Rosemarkie, two small adjacent towns included in one burgh, return a member along with Inverness, Nairn, and Forres, Besides these burghs, the united county has several villages or small towns in it, such as Contin, Shildag, Domie, Plocktown, and Ullapool, which last has 500 or 600 inhabitants. Stornoway, in Lewis, is a thriving burgh of barony, with some good streets of houses, and a considerable quantity of shipping, and, with its suburbs and environs, it contains nearly 3000 inhabitants. Sheriff and commissary courts, bailie, excise, and justice of peace courts, are regularly held in it.</p><p>In Ross and Cromarty there are many ancient and curious remains. In the parish of Nigg, the site of the castle of Dunskeath, built by William the Lion in the year 1174, is still to be distinguished. At Shandwick is the <hi rend="italic">Clach-a-Charridh,</hi>  or the Stone of the Burial-place. On one side of it a large cross is still to be traced, wrought with an intricate maze of runic knotting. On the sides of the shaft are two animals resembling an elephant and a lion, above each of which there is a figure that appears to lean forward from a cross. On the reverse side of the obelisk there are processions, hunting scenes, and combats. The ground surrounding the spot where it stands was for centuries used as a place of interment. There is a similar though smaller stone in the church-yard of Nigg. It originally stood near the gate, but it was thrown down by the fall of a belfrey in 1725, and it is now fixed to the eastern gable. The top is of a triangular shape, and it has on one side of it two priest-like figures attired in long garments, each furnished with a book, and inclining forward as if intent on reading and devotion. Between them is a small circular table or altar ; and a dove seems to descend from above with a circular cake in its bill. Under the table there are two large dogs. Lower down on the stone there is a cross, and the spaces above and below the arms of it are divided into rectangular compartments of mathematical exactness. The hieroglyphics of the opposite side are in lower relief ; and in the centre appears the chief figure, that of a man attired in long garments, caressing a fawn, with a lamb and harp directly fronting him. In the space beneath there is a man clashing a pair of cymbals, and a man on horseback surrounded by animals of the chase ; while on the upper part of the stone there are dogs, deer, and armed huntsmen, with an eagle or raven surmounting the whole. These obelisks or crosses are supposed to be of Scandinavian origin. Craig-chenichan, or the Rock of Lamentation, in the parish of Kincardine, is memorable for being the place where the Marquis of Montrose was defeated by Colonel Strachan, after which he swam across the Kyle, and lay concealed in Assint, until apprehended and sent prisoner to Inverness. On the summit of Ormondy Hill, 200 feet above the level of the sea, near Castletown Point, in the parish of Avoch, are the foundations of a large and very ancient castle, to which tradition has given the name of Douglas. On a large plain to the westward of the church of Eddertown there are indications of an encampment, where a battle is said to have been fought with the Danes. In its vicinity there is an extensive circle of earth, about two feet higher than the circumjacent ground, flat on the top, with an obelisk in the centre ten feet in height, on which a number of rude figures may still be traced. This is regarded as the tomb of some Danish prince. The abbey and castle of Lochlin, in the parish of Fearn, are remarkable. The former measured ninety-nine by twenty-five feet within the walls. It was used for divine service till October 1742, when the roof fell in and killed thirty-six people. The castle of Lochlin is supposed to be more than five centuries old. It stands on an eminence about six miles to the eastward of Tain. Its plan is that of two squares united at the angles, in which there is a staircase leading to the top of it, which is sixty feet high. The castle of Cadboll, of which little remains, is supposed to be yet more ancient than that of Lochlin. There is a tradition that no one ever died in it ; and that about a century and a half ago, a certain Lady May, whose lingering diseases made her long for death, was removed from it at her own request that she might die, and her wish is said to have been gratified immediately after her removal. In the parish of Kirkmichael, and close on the edge of a precipice rising from the shore of Cromarty Frith, is <hi rend="italic">Tigh-na-Craig,</hi>  or the House of the Rock. It is a very curious old building, fifty feet in height, of great antiquity, having been erected by the Urquharts, barons of Cromarty. In Loch Carron are the ruins of Strome Castle ; and at Lan-ganduin there is one of those buildings called <hi rend="italic">Duin,</hi>  which are so frequent on the west coast. The castle of Eilean Donnan, on an insulated point between Lochs Ling and Duich, in Kintail, though greatly dilapidated, is still a fine picturesque ruin. It is supposed to have been built in the time of Alexander the Third. It was long the baronial strength of the lords of Kintail ; but after the battle of Glen-sheil in 1719, it was demolished by a ship of war. Some of the cannon-balls fired against it have been found nearly a mile above the castle. Near Ob-Inag, in the parish of Glensheil, is to be found a fine specimen of what has been called the Pictish Tower. At Dingwall are the remains of the ancient castle of the earls of Ross. The hill of Knock-farril, in the parish of Fodderty, is crowned with one of those curious and puzzling morsels of antiquity, usually known by the name of vitrified forts. The walls enclose nearly an acre of level ground, from which Craig Phadric near Inverness, and Dunskaith on the northern Sutor of Cromarty, are distinctly visible, and so it is connected with a chain of these signal-posts. It is probable that the early inhabitants of the country burned their beltane fires on these signal-hills ; and these we know were so immense that they might very well account for the vitrification of the circular walls of dry stone which were erected to prevent the fuel from being blown about and dispersed. There are many ancient single stones, and circles of stones, and cairns, in different parts of Ross and Cromarty. In Lewis are to be found the following ruins of religious houses: St Collums in Ui, St Cowstans in Garrabost, and St Aula in Gress. On the Flannel Isles, called by Buchanan <hi rend="italic">Insulœ Sacrœ,</hi>  the ruins of religious houses are still extant. At Mealister and Pabay are the remains of nunneries ; and there is a similar ruin on the island of St Colme, in the entrance to Loch Erisort. At Carloway there is a fine specimen of those towers already mentioned, perfectly circular, and thirty feet high ; and there are three or four more in Barras parish. In the year 1831, a considerable number of little figures, carved in ivory, were found in the sands at the head of the Bay of Uig. We saw them in Edinburgh, and they appeared to us very much to resemble the kings and pieces at chess.</p><p>There are many curious caves both on the east and west coasts of Ross and Cromarty; but the most remarkable is the Seal Cave, in the parish of Stornoway, in Lewis, which is considered to be only secondary in grandeur, and in the splendour of its stalactitic formations, to the famous cave in Skye.</p><p>The principal clans in Ross and Cromarty are the Mackenzies, Rosses, Frasers, Mackays, Macraes, and Munroes. Gaelic is universally spoken, though it is less used on the eastern than on the western side of the county. In Lewis it is the chief language. The Highland dress is now seldom worn, except on occasions of ceremony or festivity.</p><p>The following table contains an abstract of the population of Ross and Cromarty at three different periods.</p><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
