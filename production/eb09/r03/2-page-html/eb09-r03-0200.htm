<p><span class="font4">The climate of Roumania is one of extremes as regards temperature. Winter and summer are almost equally&nbsp;trying. In the former season the thermometer may sink to&nbsp;- 15° Fahr., while in the latter it may rise to from 90° to&nbsp;95°. The mean temperature of spring at Bucharest is 53°,&nbsp;summer 72</span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font4"><sup>β</sup>, autumn 65°, winter 27</span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font4">°. Spring, however, scarcely exists except in name, the interval between&nbsp;the cold winter and hot summer being very short. The&nbsp;autumn, on the other hand, is long and is the most genial&nbsp;season of the year. It lasts to the end of November.&nbsp;Being continuous with the Russian plain, Roumania is&nbsp;exposed to the bitterly cold wind from the north-east by&nbsp;which southern Russia is also scourged. In Roumania&nbsp;this wind, known as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">crwets,</span><span class="font4"> blows on an average 155 days&nbsp;in the year, while a west or south-west wind, called the&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">austru,</span><span class="font4"> equally disagreeable for its scorching heat, blows on&nbsp;an average 126 days. The rainfall is not excessive. The&nbsp;number of rainy days in the year is about 74, or only about&nbsp;two-fifths of the number round London. The summer&nbsp;months are those in which the rains are most abundant.&nbsp;Snow is unfrequent (12 days in the year). As regards&nbsp;salubrity the low-lying plains near the Danube are the&nbsp;worst part of the kingdom. Marsh fever is there prevalent,&nbsp;and the tendency to suffer from disease is increased by&nbsp;the miserable character of the dwellings occupied by the&nbsp;peasantry of that district. The houses are mere pits dug&nbsp;out in the ground and covered over with sloping roofs&nbsp;formed of branches and twigs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Three-fourths of the population are dependent upon agriculture. The plains covered by loess and black soil are admirably adapted&nbsp;for the growth of cereals, and of these the most important are&nbsp;maize, wheat, and barley. The methods of cultivation are to a&nbsp;large extent primitive and imperfect, but great improvements are&nbsp;taking place through the application of foreign capital to the&nbsp;development of the native resources. Improved agricultural implements of all kinds have been introduced of late years in great&nbsp;numbers. The old plough, which has a share resembling a lance&nbsp;head, which enters the ground horizontally and thus merely&nbsp;scratches the surface, is being rapidly superseded by ploughs of&nbsp;English and Austrian manufacture. These improvements, which&nbsp;have been greatly stimulated by the alteration in the status of the&nbsp;Roumanian peasantry brought about by the law of 1864, and likewise by the introduction of railways, have resulted in an enormous&nbsp;increase in the amount of the production of cereals. Roumania is&nbsp;one of the principal grain-exporting countries in Europe, and the&nbsp;increase in the production just alluded to is sufficiently well indicated by the figures given below relative to the exports of grain to&nbsp;the United Kingdom. The great variations in these figures, though&nbsp;obviously due in part to political causes, likewise serve to illustrate&nbsp;the chief drawback under which Roumanian agriculture labours—&nbsp;namely, the liability to drought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Besides forming a valuable article of export maize furnishes the chief food of the people. The great body of Roumanians seldom&nbsp;eat meat except on feast days, and the favourite food is a dish&nbsp;called </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mamaliga,</span><span class="font3"> made by boiling maize-meal and flavouring it&nbsp;with a little salt. It thus resembles the hominy of the Americans.&nbsp;In addition to cereals many kinds of vegetables, including garlic,&nbsp;melons, and cucumbers, are grown. Hemp and colza are also&nbsp;important products, and tobacco furnished a considerable article of&nbsp;export until it was made a monopoly of the state in 1872. As&nbsp;already mentioned, wine and numerous fruits are produced on the&nbsp;foot-hills of the Carpathians, but owing to neglect the products are&nbsp;greatly inferior to what they ought to be. Nothing, it is said, but&nbsp;care in the cultivation of the vine and the preparation and preservation of the wine is necessary to make Roumania a winegrowing country of the first rank. As it is, vines are estimated to&nbsp;cover only about 250,000 acres, or about ,⅜-,∙ of the entire surface.&nbsp;From plums the Roumanians extract a strong spirit known as&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tsuica,</span><span class="font3"> and it is chiefly for this that the plum-tree is cultivated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The rearing of domestic animals is likewise an important industry, but it has not advanced so much of late years as the&nbsp;growth of cereals. The exports of cattle are almost stationary.&nbsp;Oxen are of much more importance than horses, being chiefly used&nbsp;in field labours. Buffaloes also are reared for the purpose, and are&nbsp;much valued for their strength. Sheep and cattle rearing forms&nbsp;the chief occupation of the sparse population of the Dobrudja.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">About one-sixth of the total surface of Roumania is estimated to be covered with forests producing valuable timber trees. Oaks,&nbsp;firs, and beeches are said to be met with having a diameter of more&nbsp;than 8 feet at the height of 33 feet above the ground. The warm&nbsp;summers and cold winters are favourable to the quality of the&nbsp;wood, which is hard and lasting. Unfortunately there is a good&nbsp;deal of recklessness in the way in which the forests are utilized,&nbsp;and they are said to be fast disappearing ; but it is to be hoped&nbsp;that the influence of the College of Agriculture and Sylviculture at&nbsp;Eerestreu, 2 miles from Bucharest, will help to put a check upon&nbsp;this improvidence, as it is without doubt contributing greatly to&nbsp;the promotion of Roumanian agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The mineral wealth on the Roumanian side of the Carpathians is considerable, but at present there are only three minerals that&nbsp;have any great industrial importance. These are rock-salt,&nbsp;petroleum, and lignite. The salt mines are a state monopoly, and&nbsp;two of them, at Ocna-Mare and Telega, are partly worked by&nbsp;convicts. The depth from which the salt is extracted nowhere&nbsp;exceeds 300 feet. The average quantity of salt sold annually is&nbsp;about 62,000 tons. Lignite is important inasmuch as it is used&nbsp;along with wood on the railways, as well as in.brick and lime&nbsp;kilns. Coal is also found, in some places even at the surface, but,&nbsp;though one or two mines have boen opened, the total production is&nbsp;insignificant. Ozocerite, or fossil wax, is frequently found in&nbsp;association with lignite, but is used only in small quantity by&nbsp;the peasantry. Among other minerals are anthracite, iron, gold,&nbsp;copper, lead, sulphur, cobalt, and arsenic ; and there is little doubt&nbsp;that some of these at least might be made economically valuable if&nbsp;the resources of the country were adequately developed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">So far the manufacturing industries of Roumania are hardly worthy of mention. There are petroleum refineries, one or two&nbsp;sugar refineries,&quot; numerous steam-mills for grinding flour, besides&nbsp;large numbers of floating maize-mills on the Danube ; but in&nbsp;addition to these there are only a few manufactories at Galatz.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the account just given of the products of Roumania it follows that the exports of the kingdom consist chiefly of raw&nbsp;produce, and above all of cereals, while the imports are mainly&nbsp;composed of manufactured articles. The countries with which the&nbsp;trade is chiefly carried on are Austria (with about 40 per cent, of&nbsp;the whole trade in 1883), Great Britain (about 30 per cent.),&nbsp;France (about 10 per cent.), Germany (about 8 per cent.), Turkey,&nbsp;and Russia. The foreign commerce of Roumania is centred in&nbsp;Galatz, which is situated at the bend of the Danube where the river&nbsp;once more turns eastward on reaching the northern extremity of&nbsp;the Dobrudja plateau. From this centre there is one line of railway leading into Russia, while others pass through the interior of&nbsp;Roumania and connect with the Austrian lines in the north and&nbsp;south of Hungary. The first Roumanian railway was that from&nbsp;Giurgevo to Bucharest, opened in 1869. In 1884 there were about&nbsp;1000 miles of railway in the kingdom. The internal trade of&nbsp;Roumania is almost entirely in the hands of the Jews. It is&nbsp;greatly hampered by the existence of the octroi in all the large&nbsp;towns, almost all the necessaries of life as well as luxuries being&nbsp;taxed when introduced within the municipal boundaries.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The annual yield of cereals of all kinds is roughly estimated at 15,000,000 quarters. The number of horned cattle in the country&nbsp;is about 3,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In 1883 the following were the values of the principal articles of import and export :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The total imports of British home produce, mostly cotton goods, &amp;c., and iron, into Roumaniain 18S3 amounted to £1,344,619, and&nbsp;the total exports, mostly barley and maize, of Ronmania to Great&nbsp;Britain to £3,516,442.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There were in 1884 about ICOO miles of railway complete in the kingdom, and 3000 miles of telegraph lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The estimated population of the country is 5,376,000, including about 400,000 Jews and 200,000 Gipsies. About four and a half&nbsp;millions of the population belong to the Roumanian branch of the&nbsp;Orthodox Greek Church, and there are 114,000 Roman Catholics&nbsp;and 13,800 Protestants.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
