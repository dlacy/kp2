asovereign principality in Germany. It is 305 geographical square miles in extent, and is divided into eleven bailiwicks, which comprise eight cities and towns, and 155 villages, with, in 1838, 65,694 inhabitants, all Lutherans, except ,150 Catholics and about the same number of Jews. The income of the state is L.32,500, arising partly from domains, besides which the prince has estates in Holstein, which are his private property. The debt amounts to about two yearsâ€™ income, but by a sinking fund is gradually diminishing. The contingent of force to the German confederation is fixed at 539 men. The greater part of the territory is on the Thuringian Hills, but between them are valleys of considerable fertility, especially that through which the Saale passes, and in which the capital, Rudolstadt, stands ; but much of the land is poor, and scantily rewards the labour of the husbandman. It does, however, with the aid of potatoes, which are extensively cultivated, yield sufficient bread-corn, chiefly rye, for the subsistence of the inhabitants. Flax is extensively grown ; but the mines afford more employment, yielding iron and lead, and some earths well adapted for making pottery-ware, all of which, with the addition of glass manufactories, give subsistence to the labouring classes. There are two cities, viz. Rudolstadt with 4000, und Frankenhausen with 3900 inhabitants.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
