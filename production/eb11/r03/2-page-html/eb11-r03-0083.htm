<p><span class="font0">counter spell of equal or greater power; nevertheless, the intrinsic tone is that of a categorical assertion of binding force and efficacy. Again, in magic the self-realizing force is apt to&nbsp;seem to reside in the Suggestional machinery rather than in the&nbsp;spiritual qualifications of the magician, though this is by no&nbsp;means invariably the case. On the whole, however, spells&nbsp;and ceremonies are wont to be regarded as an inheritable and&nbsp;transferable property containing efficacy in themselves. And&nbsp;what is true of magic is equally true of much of primitive, and&nbsp;even of relatively advanced, religion. Dr J. G. Frazer has&nbsp;pronounced the following to be marks of a primitive ritual:&nbsp;negatively, that there are no priests, no temples and no gods&nbsp;(though he holds that departmental, non-individual “ spirits &quot;&nbsp;are recognized); positively, that the rites are magical rather&nbsp;than propitiatory </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(The Goldsn Bough,</span><span class="font0"> 2nd ed. ii. 191). If we&nbsp;leave it an open question whether, instead of “ spirits,” it&nbsp;would not be safer to speak of <sup>44</sup> powers &quot; (to which not a&nbsp;soul-like nature, but simply a capacity for exercising magic,&nbsp;is attributed), this characterization may be accepted as applying to many, if not to all, the rites of primitive religion. Thus&nbsp;the well-known totemic ceremonies of Central Australia afford&nbsp;a striking example of rites of a deeply religious import—in the&nbsp;sense that the purpose they embody is that of consecrating&nbsp;certain functions of the common life (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Religion)</span><span class="font0">—yet&nbsp;almost wholly magical in form. They resolve themselves on&nbsp;analysis into (1) direct acts of magical suggestion, and (2) acts&nbsp;commemorative of the magical doings of mythical ancestors,&nbsp;the purport of which may be regarded as indirectly and constructively magical, on the principle that in magic to mention&nbsp;a thing's origin is to control it, to recount another’s wonderworking is to reproduce his power, and so on. It is to be noted,&nbsp;however, that other Australian rites are found, notably those&nbsp;that accompany initiation in the south-eastern region, over&nbsp;which anthropomorphic beings having enough individuality&nbsp;to rank as “gods” undoubtedly preside; but even here,&nbsp;though traces of propitiatory worship may be discernible (the&nbsp;evidence being scanty and conflicting), acts of pure magic&nbsp;are decidedty to the fore. And what is true of the most&nbsp;primitive and Unreflective forms of cult remains true of more&nbsp;advanced types which have become relatively self-conscious.&nbsp;There is little or no felt opposition between processes implying control and processes of a propitiatory character in the&nbsp;religion of the Pueblo Indians, which American ethnologists&nbsp;have been so successful in expounding, or, to mount to a still&nbsp;higher level, in the Vedic, Assyrian or Egyptian cults. The&nbsp;leading idea, we may even say, is that expressed so happily&nbsp;by a character in Renan’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Le Prêtre de Nemi:</span><span class="font0"> “ L'ordre du&nbsp;monde dépend de l'ordre des rites qu'on observe ” (cf. A. Lang,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Myth, Ritual and Religion,</span><span class="font0"> 2nd ed. i. 251). As regards the&nbsp;most developed forms of religion, whilst the old procedure&nbsp;largely survives unchanged, its original intention is disowned&nbsp;by theologians, though it may be doubted if the popular mind&nbsp;is always strong enough to withstand the appeal of prima facie&nbsp;appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This proneness to impute efficacy to ritual is immensely reinforced by another social proclivity, more or less distinct in&nbsp;its ultimate nature, which causes the rite to rank as a divine&nbsp;ordinance or command. Naturally if the god manifests himself&nbsp;by means of certain forms, if he is reputed to have founded or&nbsp;revealed them, or if he has been known to evince displeasure&nbsp;at departures from them, there is strong reason to think that&nbsp;such forms are efficacious, and that in a sense of themselves,&nbsp;namely, by being what they are. At the sociological level&nbsp;of thought this divine sanction has to be treated as the echo&nbsp;of a social sanction which ratifies and protects religious&nbsp;custom. In early society the influence of what Walter Bagehot&nbsp;(in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Physics and Politics,</span><span class="font0"> 9th ed. p. 102) calls the “ persecuting&nbsp;tendency ” in enforcing custom is on the whole not markedly&nbsp;in evidence. The iact is that imitation in a homogeneous group&nbsp;produces such unanimity that, with the help of some education,&nbsp;notably the instruction given at the time of initiation, all nonconformity is nipped in the bud. Of the Central Australian&nbsp;ceremonies we read that they <sup>44</sup> had to be performed in precisely&nbsp;the same way in which they had been in the Alcheringa (lit.&nbsp;* dream-time ' = age of mythical tribal ancestors). Everything&nbsp;was ruled by precedent; to change even the decoration of a performer would have been an unheard-of thing; the reply,<sup>4</sup> It was so&nbsp;in the Alchcringa,' was considered as perfectly satisfactory by way&nbsp;of explanation ” (B. Spcnccr and F. Gillen, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Native Tribes of&nbsp;Central Australia,</span><span class="font0"> 324). Here we perceive the social sanction of&nbsp;public opinion insensibly merging in a supernatural sanction.&nbsp;The tribe is a religious partnership with a divine past with which&nbsp;it would not willingly break. As Mr Lang well puts it, <sup>44</sup> Ritual&nbsp;is preserved because it preserves luck &quot; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(loc. cit.).</span><span class="font0"> Given an&nbsp;intrinsic sacredness, it is but a step to associate definite gods with&nbsp;the origin or purpose of a rite, whose interest it thereupon&nbsp;becomes to punish omissions or innovations by the removal of&nbsp;their blessing (which is little more than to say that the rite loses&nbsp;its efficacy), or by the active infliction of disaster on the community. In the primitive society it is hard to point to any&nbsp;custom to which sacredness does not in some degree attach, but,&nbsp;naturally, the more important and solemn the usage, the more&nbsp;rigid the religious conservatism. Thus there are indications&nbsp;that in Australia, at the highly sacred ceremony of circumcision,&nbsp;the fire-stick was employed after stone implements were known;&nbsp;and we have an exact parallel at a higher level of culture, the&nbsp;stone implement serving for the same operation when iron is&nbsp;already in common use (Spencer and Gillen, ib. 401; cf. E. B.&nbsp;Tylor, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Early History of Mankind,</span><span class="font0"> 3rd ed. p. 217).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Interpretation of Ritual.—</span><span class="font0">A valuable truth insisted on by the late W. Robertson Smith </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Religion of the Semites,</span><span class="font0"> 17 sqq.)&nbsp;is that in primitive religion it is ritual that generates and sustains&nbsp;myth, and not the other way about. Sacred lore of course cannot&nbsp;be dispensed with; even Australian society, Whichhashardly&nbsp;reached the stage of having priests, needs its </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Oknirabata</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;<sup>44</sup> great instructor ” (Spencer and Gillen, ib. 303). The function of&nbsp;such an expert, however, is chiefly to hand on mere rules for&nbsp;the performance of religious acts. If his lore include sacred&nbsp;histories, it is largely, we may suspect, because the description&nbsp;and dramatization of the doings of divine persons enter into&nbsp;ritual as a means of magical control. Similarly, the sacred&nbsp;books of the religions of middle grade teem with minute prescriptions as to ritual, but are almost destitute of doctrine. Even in&nbsp;the highest religions, where orthodoxy is the main requirement,&nbsp;and ritual is held merely to symbolize dogma, there is a remarkable rigidity about the dogma that is doubtless in large part due&nbsp;to its association with ritual forms many of them bearing the&nbsp;most primeval stamp. As regards the symbolic interpretation of&nbsp;ritual, this is usually held not to be primitive; and it is&nbsp;doubtless true that an Unreflective age is hardly aware of the&nbsp;difference between <sup>44</sup> outward sign ” and <sup>44</sup> inward meaning,&quot;&nbsp;and thinks as it were by means of its eyes. Nevertheless,&nbsp;it is easier to define fetishism (a fetish <sup>44</sup> differing from an idol in&nbsp;that it is worshipped in its own character, not as the symbol,&nbsp;image or occasional residence of a deity,&quot; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New English Dictionary,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Oxford, 1901) than it is to bring such a fetishism home to any&nbsp;savage people, the West African negroes not excluded (cf. A. B.&nbsp;Ellis, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Tshispeaking Peoples of the Gold Coast of</span><span class="font0"> IF. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Africa,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">192). It is the magic power, virtue or grace residing in, and&nbsp;proceeding from, the material object—a power the communicability of which constitutes the whole working hypothesis of&nbsp;the magico-religious performance—that is valued in those cases&nbsp;where native opinion can be tested. Moreover, it must be&nbsp;remembered that in the act of magic a symbolic method is&nbsp;consciously pursued, as witness the very formulas employed:&nbsp;<sup>44</sup> As I burn this image, so may the man be consumed,&quot; or the&nbsp;even more explicit,<sup>44</sup> It is not wax I am scorching; it is the liver,&nbsp;heart and spleen of So-and-so that I scorch ” (W. W. Skeat,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Malay Magic,</span><span class="font0"> 570) ,where appearance and reality are distinguished&nbsp;in order to be mystically reunited. Now it is important to&nbsp;observe that from the symbol as embodying an imperative to the&nbsp;symbol as expressing an optative is a transition of meaning that&nbsp;involves no change of form whatever; and, much as theorists&nbsp;Iove to contrast the Suggestional and the petitionary attitudes,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
