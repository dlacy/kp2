<p><span class="font0">true notion of the richness and copiousness of Frankish romance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We know from Eginhard that the Frankish heroic ballads were reduced to writing by Charlemagne’s order,&nbsp;and thus the first step was taken which led to the creation&nbsp;of similar ballads about himself and his principal warriors.&nbsp;His own large and catholic spirit seems to have embraced&nbsp;all the people within his dominions, and thus indirectly&nbsp;brought about the official employment of the French language in the famous compact between his grandsons in 841.&nbsp;He was then only twenty-eight years dead, yet his influence&nbsp;was still so mighty that even the Gauls and Aquitanians&nbsp;are declared in a 9th-century chronicle to have gloried in&nbsp;bearing the name of Franks. This both implies an amalgamation of the two races more complete than is usually&nbsp;believed, and accounts for the creation of French as well&nbsp;as of Frankish ballads on the life and exploits of Charlemagne in the second half of the 9th century. The number&nbsp;of persons who could speak only Theotisc (Teutonic language) and of those who could speak the two languages&nbsp;was of course constantly diminishing, and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">chanson de&nbsp;geste</span><span class="font0"> soon displaced the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Heldengedicht</span><span class="font0"> within the limits&nbsp;of modern France. Of all the French ballads current in&nbsp;the 9th and lθth centuries some have perished utterly,&nbsp;others survive only in later refusions ; the most ancient&nbsp;now extant is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chanson de Roland,</span><span class="font0"> in the modified&nbsp;form which was given to it soon after 1066 by a Norman&nbsp;called Turold. This poem contains so many references to&nbsp;others on Charlemagne and his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">douze pairs</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paladins&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">as to make it certain that such a ballad-literature existed&nbsp;in the 9th and lθth centuries. None of the existing&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">chansons de geste</span><span class="font0"> represents those older forms ; all are rifaci-menti of the 12th and l3th centuries, and bear evidence&nbsp;of additions, interpolations, and arbitrary changes. In&nbsp;the 13th century we find the older episodical ballads rearranged in the form of “ cyclic poems,” and falling into&nbsp;three groups, which take each its name from the central&nbsp;personage or subject. One is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Geste</span><span class="font0"> of the king&nbsp;(Charlemagne, his father, and grandfather) ; the next is&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Geste</span><span class="font0"> of Provence or of Garin de Montglane ; and the&nbsp;third, the most heterogeneous, is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Geste</span><span class="font0"> of Doon of&nbsp;Mayence. Each of these is composed of many separate&nbsp;parts, but the first may be generally described as the entire&nbsp;mythical history of Charles the Great, his family, and his&nbsp;faithful peers; the second a separate and independent set&nbsp;of narratives concerning his conquest of Narbonne; the&nbsp;third a history of his wars with rebellious vassals and with&nbsp;traitors, including Ganelon, through whom the peers were&nbsp;defeated and slain at Roncesvalles. The number and&nbsp;names of the peers are variously given in nearly all the&nbsp;poems, but Roland and Oliver are included in all the lists,&nbsp;united as in a proverbial English phrase. Roland is the&nbsp;daring warrior, Oliver the wise one ; the one is the&nbsp;Achilles, the other the Ulysses of the Carolingian epopee.&nbsp;Many of the early </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">chansons</span><span class="font0"> give the name of Turpin, archbishop of Rheims (an actual historical contemporary of&nbsp;Charlemagne), as one of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pairs,—</span><span class="font0">warrior and priest combined ; and there is a chronicle bearing his name which&nbsp;has furnished the later romancers with a goodly proportion of their matter. This </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pseudo-Chronicle of Turpin</span><span class="font0"> was&nbsp;written in Latin, by various hands and in various places&nbsp;between 1000 and 1150, being apparently constructed&nbsp;from the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">chansons</span><span class="font0"> for the purpose of forging history to&nbsp;suit monastic ends. It took its final and existing form&nbsp;between 1160 and 1180, when edited by Géoffroy de&nbsp;Brueil, and was for many centuries regarded as actual history. This work was not the first so-called history which&nbsp;embodied monastic fiction in the narrative of Charlemagne’s&nbsp;career. A monk of St Gall wrote about 890 a chronicle&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Gestis Karoli Magni,</span><span class="font0"> based partly upon oral tradition,&nbsp;in which certain fabulous incidents appeared for the first&nbsp;time, such as Pippin’s fight with the lion, and the conversation about the Iron Emperor between Ottokar the Frank&nbsp;(better known as Ogier the Dane) and the Lombard king&nbsp;Desiderius, on the walls of Pavia, when Charlemagne was&nbsp;advancing to besiege it. Another fabulous incident of&nbsp;great moment in the romances is Charlemagne’s supposititious journey to the Holy Land, which was related&nbsp;for the first time by Benedict, monk of St André, about&nbsp;968, in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Descmptio qualiter Carolus M. Clavum et&nbsp;Coroηam Domini a C onstantinopli Aquisgrani attulemt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A great deal of historical truth underlies the absurdities of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Turpin Chronicle</span><span class="font0"> and the rhapsodies of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">chansons&nbsp;de geste.</span><span class="font0"> Compare Roland, Legend of. In fact all the&nbsp;older poetic literature of this cycle is based upon purely&nbsp;historical events and real personages ; it is only at a later&nbsp;date that the events are multiplied or variously misapplied,&nbsp;and that the personages also are arbitrarily distorted and&nbsp;augmented, according to the fancy and local sentiments&nbsp;of the various writers. As for the language in which the&nbsp;older poems were written, the idea that they were chiefly&nbsp;the work of troubadours in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">langue d<sup>,</sup>oc</span><span class="font0"> is now abandoned. Gaston Paris holds the curious theory that the&nbsp;French language </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(langue d<sup>,</sup>oiΓ)</span><span class="font0"> was popularly current over&nbsp;the north of Italy, instancing the works of Rusticien of&nbsp;Pisa as an illustration, besides certain works in Italianized&nbsp;French which belong to this class. Such a notion cannot&nbsp;be accepted readily, as we know that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">langue d’oc</span><span class="font0"> was&nbsp;the general language of southern France, western Spain,&nbsp;and north-west Italy. But it is possible that the French&nbsp;language </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(langue d<sup>,</sup>οiΓ)</span><span class="font0"> may have been used as a general&nbsp;literary vehicle for the Charlemagne cycle of poetical&nbsp;fiction, and that Rusticien or Rustighello may have compiled an abridgment of the Frankish stories. Such a work,&nbsp;if it ever existed, has perished ; and it is in the Italian&nbsp;language of Tuscany that we find the first prose compilation of Carolingian romance. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Reali di Francia&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(Princes of France), if it had been completed, -would have&nbsp;occupied a corresponding position to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Morte Arthur</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;the British cycle ; for, while no such popular compilation&nbsp;appears to have ever been made in France itself and in&nbsp;the French tongue (unless the late 15th-century </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fierabras</span><span class="font0"> may be considered to take that rank), the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Reali</span><span class="font0"> in&nbsp;verse and in prose was current in Italy early in the 14th&nbsp;century. From some peculiarities in the language it is&nbsp;conjectured that the author, although writing in Tuscan,&nbsp;was a Venetian. In France at the same period we find&nbsp;only the separate fictions, mostly in verse, but a few in&nbsp;prose. The first French prose compilation of the whole&nbsp;cycle was made by David Aubert in 1458 for Philip of Burgundy ; but it Λvas dead-born and has never been printed.&nbsp;The second, in three books, was made a few years later by&nbsp;Jean Bagnyon, for Henri Bolomier, canon of Lausanne; it&nbsp;was first printed in 1478, and is entitled in some editions&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">La Coηqueste que fist Charlemagne es Espaigηes,</span><span class="font0"> and in&nbsp;others </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fierabras</span><span class="font0"> ; both titles are insufficient, having apparently been merely created to supply the lack of a general&nbsp;heading. The first section is a summary chronicle of the&nbsp;history of the Franks from Clovis to Charlemagne, the&nbsp;second an abridgment of the old poem of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fierabras,</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;the third an account of the Spanish expedition, taken from&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pseudo-Turpin.</span><span class="font0"> This work became very popular in&nbsp;and out of France, and most readers during the 16th&nbsp;and 17th centuries derived their entire knowledge of the&nbsp;Charlemagne romance from it. Although the French prose&nbsp;works of the cycle were for the most part very late in&nbsp;their construction, there were three French prose translations or adaptations of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Turpin Chronicle</span><span class="font0"> executed soon&nbsp;after 1200.</span></p>
