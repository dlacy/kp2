<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RAMUSIO. The noble family of Ramusio—the spelling adopted in the publication of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Navigationi,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> though it is&nbsp;also written Ramnusio, Rhamnusio, Rannusio, &amp;c.—was&nbsp;one of note for literary and official ability during at least&nbsp;four generations. Its original home was in Rimini, and&nbsp;the municipality of that city has within the last few years&nbsp;set up a tablet on the town-hall bearing an inscription&nbsp;which may be thus rendered: “The municipality of Rimini&nbsp;here records the claim of their city to the family of the&nbsp;Ramusios, adorned during the 15th and 16th centuries by&nbsp;the illustrious jurist and man of letters Paolo the elder,&nbsp;who rendered the work of Valturius, our fellow-citizen,&nbsp;into the vernacular ; by the physician Girolamo, a most&nbsp;successful student of Oriental tongues, and the first to&nbsp;present Europe with a translation of Avicenna ; and by&nbsp;Giovanni Battista, cosmographer to the Venetian republic&nbsp;and secretary to the Council of Ten, who bequeathed to the&nbsp;world that famous collection of voyages and travels, regarded in his own day as a marvellous work, and still full&nbsp;of authority among all civilized nations.״</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Paolo the Elder </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">(c.</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1443-1506), the first of those thus commemorated, migrated in 1458 from Rimini to Venice,&nbsp;where he obtained full citizenship, studied law, and became&nbsp;a member of the magistracy, filling the offices of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">vicano,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of judicial assessor, and of criminal judge under various&nbsp;administrators of the Venetian provinces on the continent.&nbsp;He continued, however, to maintain relations with the Mala-testa princes of his native city, and in 1503 negotiated with&nbsp;them the cession of Rimini to the republic. The wife of&nbsp;Paolo, bearing the singular name of Tomyris Macachio, bore&nbsp;him three sons and four daughters. Paolo died at Bergamo&nbsp;on 19th August 1506 at the age of sixty-three, and Avas&nbsp;buried in S. Agostino at Padua. Paolo was the author of&nbsp;a variety of legal treatises and the like, and also published&nbsp;at Verona in 1483 both a corrected edition and an Italian&nbsp;translation of a once famous book, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Valturius, De re militari</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">,&nbsp;dedicating both to Pandolfo Malatesta of Rimini.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Girolamo </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(1450-1486), younger brother of Paolo, had a notable history. After he had studied medicine at Padua&nbsp;public suspicion was roused against him in connexion with&nbsp;the death of a lady with whom he had had some love&nbsp;passages, and this ran so high that he was fain, by help of&nbsp;his brother Paolo, to whom he transferred his property, to&nbsp;make his escape (about 1481-83) to Syria and to take up&nbsp;his abode at Damascus. In 1486 he removed to Beyrout,&nbsp;and died the same year, killed, as the family chronicler relates, by a surfeit of “certain fruit that Ave call </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">armellini</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">albicocche,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> but which in that country are known as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mazza-franchi,”</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> a title which English sailors in southern regions&nbsp;still give to apricots in the vernacular paraphrase of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kill-johns.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> During his stay in Syria Girolamo studied Arabic&nbsp;and made a neAv translation of Avicenna, or rather, we may&nbsp;assume, of some part of that author’s medical A\<sup>T</sup>orks (the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Canon 1).</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> It was, however, by no means the first such translation, as is erroneously alleged in the Rimini inscription,&nbsp;for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Canon</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> had been translated by Gerard of Cremona&nbsp;(d. 1187), and this version was frequently issued from the&nbsp;early press. Girolamo’s translation was never printed, but&nbsp;A\<sup>r</sup>as used by editors of versions published at Venice in 1579&nbsp;and 1606. Other Avorks of this questionable member of the&nbsp;house of Ramusio consisted of medical and philosophical&nbsp;tracts and Latin poems, some of which last were included&nbsp;in a collection published at Paris in 1791.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Gian Battista </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(1485-1557), the eldest son of Paolo Ramusio and Tomyris Macachio, Avas born at Treviso in&nbsp;1485 (20th June). Having been educated at Venice and&nbsp;at Padua, at an early age he entered the public service&nbsp;(1505), becoming in 1515 secretary of the senate and in&nbsp;1533 secretary of the Council of Ten. He also served the&nbsp;republic in various missions to foreign states, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> to Rome,&nbsp;to Switzerland, and to France, travelling over much of the&nbsp;latter country by special desire of the king, Louis XII.&nbsp;He also on several occasions filled the office of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">cancellier&nbsp;grande.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> In 1524 he married Franceschina, daughter of&nbsp;Francesco Navagero, a noble,—a papal dispensation being&nbsp;required on account of her being cousin to his mother&nbsp;Tomyris. By this lady he had one son, Paolo. In his&nbsp;old age Ramusio resigned the secretaryship and retired to&nbsp;the Villa Ramusia, a property on the river Masanga, in&nbsp;the province of Padua, which had been bestowed on his&nbsp;father in 1504 in recognition of his services in the acquisition of Rimini the year before. The delights of this retreat&nbsp;are celebrated in the poems and letters of several of Gian&nbsp;Battista’s friends. He also possessed a house at Padua&nbsp;in the Strada del Patriarcato, a mansion noted for its&nbsp;paintings and for its collection of ancient sculpture and&nbsp;inscriptions. These, too, are commemorated by various&nbsp;writers. A few days before his death Ramusio removed&nbsp;to this house in Padua, and there died, 10th July 1557, at&nbsp;the age of seventy-tAvo. He was, by his OAvn desire, buried&nbsp;at Venice, in the tomb Avhich he had made for his mother,&nbsp;in Santa Maria dell’ Orto. His Avife’s death had occurred&nbsp;in 1536. In the work called </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Museum Mazzuchellianum&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(Venice, 1761, vol. i. pi. Ixiv. No. 6) there is represented&nbsp;a 16th-century medal of Ramusio, which looks a genuine&nbsp;likeness, and a bronze example of which, without the&nbsp;reverse,@@<sup>3</sup> is preserved in St Mark’s Library. There Avas a&nbsp;portrait of him, represented as in conversation Avith Andrea&nbsp;Gradenigo, in the Sala del Maggior Consiglio, but in 1577&nbsp;this perished in a fire, as did also a portrait of his father,&nbsp;Paolo. A professed portrait of Gian Battista by Francesco&nbsp;Grisellini, in the Sala dello Scudo, appears to be, like the&nbsp;companion portrait of Marco Polo, a work of fancy. A&nbsp;public nautical school at Rimini has within the last three&nbsp;years received from the Government the title of the Isti-tuto Ramusio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Ramusio Avas evidently a general favourite, as he Avas free from pushing ambition, modest, and ingenuous, and, if it&nbsp;be safe to judge from some of the dissertations in his&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Navigationi,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> must have been a delightful companion; both&nbsp;his friend Giunti and the historian Giustiniani@@<sup>4</sup> speak of&nbsp;him with the strongest affection. He had also a great&nbsp;reputation for learning. Before he was thirty Aldus&nbsp;Manutius the elder dedicated to him his edition of Quintilian (1514); a few years later (1519) Francesco Ardano&nbsp;inscribed to him an edition of Livy, and in 1528 Bernardino&nbsp;Donati did the like with his edition of Macrobius and&nbsp;Censorinus. To Greek and Latin and the modern languages of southern Europe he is said to have added a&nbsp;knowledge of “ Oriental tongues,” but there is no e\’idence&nbsp;hoAv far this went, unless Ave accept as such a statement&nbsp;that he </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">avrs </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">selected in 1530 on account of this accomplishment to investigate the case of one David, a HebreAv,&nbsp;Avho, claiming to be of the royal house of Judah, Avished&nbsp;to establish himself at Venice outside of the Ghetto.@@<sup>5</sup> But</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
