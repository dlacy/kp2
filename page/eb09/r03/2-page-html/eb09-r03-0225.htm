<p><span class="font2">ROYAN, a town of France, in the department of Charente Inférieure, is situated on the right bank of the&nbsp;Gironde, where it joins the ocean ; a branch line of 51,&nbsp;miles connects it with Saujon, on the Seudre Railway,&nbsp;which joins the Bordeaux-Nantes line at Pons. Royan,&nbsp;which in 1881 had a population of only 4573 (5445 as a&nbsp;commune), is one of the most frequented bathing resorts&nbsp;on the Atlantic seaboard, the visitors numbering about&nbsp;80,000 annually. Royan owes this popularity to its&nbsp;charming neighbourhood, pleasantly watered by brooks&nbsp;and shaded by fine trees down to the steep rocky shore.&nbsp;The coast is divided into a number of small bays or&nbsp;“conches,” forming so many distinct beaches: to the east&nbsp;of the town is the “ Grande Conche ” ; to the south the&nbsp;“ Conche de Foncillon,” separated from the first-named&nbsp;by a quay which forms a fine terraced esplanade ; beyond&nbsp;the fort of Royan, which protects the entrance of the river,&nbsp;follow in succession the conches “ du Chay” and “ de Grand&nbsp;Robinson,” and the most fashionable of all, that of&nbsp;Pontaillac. In the Avenue de Pontaillac stand a large&nbsp;new casino, a theatre, and a hydropathic establishment.&nbsp;Royan also has a race-course and a museum of natural&nbsp;history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Royan, whose inhabitants were Protestants, Iiad to sustain in 1622 an eight days’ siege by the troops of Louis XIII. As late as&nbsp;the end of last century it was but a “bourg ” of about one thousand&nbsp;inhabitants, noticeable only for its priory, where Brantôme wrote&nbsp;a portion of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicles.</span><span class="font1"> The prosperity of the place dates from&nbsp;the Restoration, when steamboat communication was established&nbsp;with Bordeaux. The question of making of Royan the seaport&nbsp;for Bordeaux has often been mooted, but as yet the harbour is still&nbsp;a merely tidal one and is dry at low water. The sardine, here&nbsp;known by the name of royan, is caught by the local fishermen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROYER-COLLARD, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pierre Paul</span><span class="font2"> (1763-1845), French statesman and philosopher, was born on the 21st June&nbsp;1763 at Sompuis near Vitry-le-Français. At an early age&nbsp;he became a member of the bar, and pleaded several&nbsp;times in the old parlement of Paris. On the breaking out&nbsp;of the Revolution he took the popular side, and was elected&nbsp;to a seat in the municipal council of Paris. He was&nbsp;secretary to this body from 1790 to 1792, but separated&nbsp;himself from the later excesses of the Revolution. During&nbsp;the Reign of Terror he lived in retirement at Sompuis,&nbsp;and after vainly endeavouring in 1797, as member of the&nbsp;Council of Five Hundred, to bring about the restoration of&nbsp;the monarchy, he retired altogether from public life till&nbsp;the fall of Napoleon in 1814. During the interval he&nbsp;devoted himself mainly to philosophical studies. Animated&nbsp;by a profound distrust of the negative sensationalism and&nbsp;materialism which had characterized the French philosophy of the 18th century, he found a master whom he&nbsp;could follow in Thomas Reid. The study of Reid’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">inquiry,</span><span class="font2"> which he picked up on a book-stall, first gave a&nbsp;definite form and direction to his thinking. Royer-Collard&nbsp;may be said to have introduced Reid to France, and the&nbsp;works of the Scottish philosopher were translated not long&nbsp;afterwards by his pupil Joutfroy. In 1810 Royer-Collard&nbsp;became professor of philosophy, and taught with success in&nbsp;Paris, till the Restoration recalled him to political life.&nbsp;In 1815 he was elected to represent his native department&nbsp;of the Marne in the chamber of deputies ; he was also&nbsp;made councillor of state and appointed president of the&nbsp;commission of public instruction. A royalist of moderate&nbsp;views, he helped to restrain the extreme members of his&nbsp;own party, opposing alike the reactionary laws against the&nbsp;press and the proposal to give the clergy control of public&nbsp;instruction. In 1827 he was so popular as to be elected&nbsp;in seven departments, and shortly afterwards he became a&nbsp;member of the French Academy ; in the following year he&nbsp;was made president of the chamber. In this capacity he&nbsp;had the unpleasant duty of presenting to Charles X. the&nbsp;address in which the majority of the chamber refused&nbsp;their further support to the Government (March 1830).&nbsp;Royer-Collard retained his position as deputy under the&nbsp;new régime of Louis Philippe, but no longer took a prominent part in public affairs. In 1842 he withdrew completely from active life and spent most of his remaining&nbsp;time at his country seat of Chateauvieux near Sainte-Aignan. He died there on the 2d September 1845.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As a philosopher, Royer-Collard is not distinguished either by originality or profundity ; but he possesses a certain importance&nbsp;as having transplanted to France the philosophy of common sense.&nbsp;He has Iiimself left no philosophical writings except some fragments which appear in Jouil'roy’s edition of Reid ; but by his&nbsp;example and teaching he founded the school which has been&nbsp;variously named the Scoto-French, the eclectic, the spiritualistic,&nbsp;or the psychological. Maine de Biran, Cousin to some extent,&nbsp;and Jouffroy in a closer way, as well as Janet and others at the&nbsp;present day, are the chief representatives of the school. The name&nbsp;“Spiritualisme,” which is perhaps the commonest designation,&nbsp;expresses the tenacity with which, in opposition to the dominant&nbsp;Sensationalistic materialism of France, it upholds the doctrine of a&nbsp;spiritual Ego as a fact of consciousness. The title psychological,&nbsp;however, would be preferred by the philosophers themselves as&nbsp;describing their method, and the basis on which they claim to&nbsp;have erected their philosophy. Philosophy tends for them, as for&nbsp;Reid and Stewart, to become a classification of isolated facts of&nbsp;consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Several biographies of Royer-Collard have been published. Barante, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vie politique de Al. Royer-Collard, ses discours, et ses écrits,</span><span class="font0"> 1861, is the fullest.&nbsp;Others are by Philippe and Lacombe. In addition may be mentioned </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aleinoires&nbsp;sur Royer-Collard,</span><span class="font0"> by his nephew Genty de Bussy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROYLE, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">John Forbes</span><span class="font2"> (1800-1858), a distinguished botanist and teacher of materia medica. His reputation&nbsp;is especially founded upon the results of personal investigations in the Himalaya Mountains and in other parts of&nbsp;Hindustan. He was born in Cawnpore in 1800. His&nbsp;medical education was obtained in London, and on its&nbsp;completion he entered the service of the East India Company, and was sent to India in 1822 in the grade of&nbsp;assistant surgeon. In this service he devoted himself to&nbsp;studying in the field the botany and geology of the regions&nbsp;within his reach, and made large collections among the&nbsp;Himalaya Mountains. He also made special investigations of the medical properties of the plants of Hindustan&nbsp;and of the history of their uses among the native races.&nbsp;The results of these investigations appeared in 1837 in&nbsp;the form of a valuable work </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">On the Antiquity of Hindoo&nbsp;Medicine.</span><span class="font2"> For nearly ten years he held the post of superintendent of the East India Company’s botanic garden in&nbsp;the Himalayas at Saharanpur. He returned to London&nbsp;on furlough in 1831, and in 1837 he was appointed to the&nbsp;professorship of materia medica in King’s College, London,&nbsp;a position which he held till 1856. From 1838 onwards he&nbsp;conducted a special department of correspondence, relating&nbsp;to vegetable products, at the East India House, and at the&nbsp;time of his death he had just completed there the formation and arrangement of an extensive and valuable museum&nbsp;of technical products from the East Indies. In 1851 he&nbsp;superintended the Indian department of the Great Exhibition. He died at Acton near London on 2d January&nbsp;1858.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The work on which his reputation chiefly rests is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Illustrations of the Botany and other branches of Natural History of the Himalaya&nbsp;Mountains, and of the Flora of Cashmere,</span><span class="font1"> in 2 vols. 4to, begun in&nbsp;1839. It contains much information on the natural products of&nbsp;India, especially on such as are useful in the arts or as drugs. In&nbsp;addition to this work, however, he wrote several others of repute,&nbsp;viz., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">An Essay on the Productive Resources of India</span><span class="font1"> (1840), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Manual&nbsp;of Mnteria Medica</span><span class="font1"> (1845), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">An Essay on the Cultivation of CoUon&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1857), and on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Cordage Plants and Vegetable FibresofIndia&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(l855). He also published a number of papers, between 1832 and&nbsp;1855, upon subjects akin to those of his larger works, in scientific&nbsp;journals, for the most part published in India. Among these papers&nbsp;are included three on geological subjects. A list of the whole will&nbsp;be found in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Royal Society's Catalogue of Scientific Papers.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
