<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">spondence ceases, and it is not renewed till after the close of his brief but brilliant career as a dramatist (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Esther</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Athalie</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> excepted). This is the more to be regretted in&nbsp;that the most disputable events of Racine’s life as well as&nbsp;the greater part of his literary work fall within this silent&nbsp;period. His strange behaviour to Molière, his virulent&nbsp;attack on his masters and friends of Port Royal, and the&nbsp;sudden change by which, after the failure of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Phèdre</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and&nbsp;for no clearly expressed cause, a man of pleasure and an&nbsp;active literary worker became a sober domestic character&nbsp;of almost ostentatiously religious habits, and abstained&nbsp;from almost all but official work, are unillumined by any&nbsp;words of his own. From this time forward the gossip of&nbsp;the period and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> by his son Louis are the chief&nbsp;sources of information. Unfortunately Louis Racine,&nbsp;though a man of some ability and of unimpeached character, was only six years old when his father died, and had&nbsp;no direct knowledge. Still his account represents family&nbsp;papers and traditions and seems to have been carefully,&nbsp;as it is certainly in the main impartially, written. From&nbsp;other sources—notably Boileau, Brossette, and Yalincourt—&nbsp;a good deal of pretty certainly authentic information is&nbsp;obtainable, and there exists a considerable body of correspondence between Boileau and the poet during the last&nbsp;ten years of Racine’s life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The first but the least characteristic of the dramas by which Racine is known, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">La Thébaide,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> was finished by the&nbsp;end of 1663, and on Friday 20th June 1664 it was played&nbsp;by Molière’s company at the Palais Royal theatre. Some&nbsp;editors assert that Molière himself acted in it, but the&nbsp;earliest account of the cast we have, and that is sixty years&nbsp;after date, omits his name, though those of Madeleine Béjard&nbsp;and Mademoiselle de Brie occur. There is a tradition,&nbsp;supported by very little evidence, that Molière suggested&nbsp;the subject ; on the other hand, Louis Racine distinctly&nbsp;says that his father wrote most of the play at Uzès before&nbsp;he knew Molière. Racine’s own letters, which cover the&nbsp;period of composition, though not that of representation,&nbsp;give little help in deciding this not very important question, except that it appears from them that the play was&nbsp;designed for the rival theatre, and that “La Déhanchée,”&nbsp;Racine’s familiar name for Mademoiselle de Beauchâteau,&nbsp;with whom he was intimate, was to play Antigone. The&nbsp;play itself is by far the weakest of Racine’s works. He&nbsp;has borrowed much from Euripides and not a little from&nbsp;Rotrou ; and in his general style and plan he has as yet&nbsp;struck out no great variation from Corneille. We have&nbsp;very little intelligence about the reception of the piece.&nbsp;It was acted twelve times during the first month, which&nbsp;was for the period a very fair success, and was occasionally revived during the year following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">This is apparently the date of the pleasant picture of the four friends which La Fontaine draws in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Psyche,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Racine figuring as Acante, “qui aimait extrêmement les&nbsp;jardins, les fleurs, les ombrages.” Various stories, more&nbsp;or less mythical, also belong to this period ; the best&nbsp;authenticated of them contributes to the documents for&nbsp;Racine’s unamiable temper. He had absolutely no reason&nbsp;to complain of Chapelain, who had helped him with&nbsp;criticism, obtained royal gifts for him, and, in a fashion,&nbsp;started him in the literary career, yet he helped in composing the lampoon of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chapelain décoiffé.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> The sin would&nbsp;not be unpardonable if it stood alone, but unluckily a much&nbsp;graver one followed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">We have no definite details as to Racine’s doings during the year 1664, but in February 1665 he read at the Hôtel&nbsp;de Nevers before La Rochefoucauld, Madame de la Fayette,&nbsp;Madame de Sévigné, and other scarcely less redoubtable&nbsp;judges the greater part of his second acted play, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Alexandre&nbsp;le Grand,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> or, as Pomponne (who tells the fact) calls it, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Parus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">This was a frequent kind of preliminary advertisement at the time, and it seems, as we find from the rhymed gazettes,&nbsp;to have been successful. It was anxiously expected by&nbsp;the public, and Molière’s company played it on 4th December,—Monsieur, his wife Henrietta of England, and many&nbsp;other distinguished persons being present. The gazetteer&nbsp;Subligny vouches for its success, and the still more certain&nbsp;testimony of the accounts of the theatre shows that the&nbsp;receipts were good and, what is more, steady. But a fortnight afterwards </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Alexandre</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> was played, “de complot avec&nbsp;M. Racine,” says La Grange, by the rival actors (who had&nbsp;four days before performed it in private) at the Hôtel de&nbsp;Bourgogne. A vast amount of ink has been spilt on this&nbsp;question, but no one has produced any valid justification&nbsp;for Racine. That the piece failed at the Palais Royal is&nbsp;demonstrably false, and as this is stated in the earliest&nbsp;attempt to excuse Racine, and the only one made in his&nbsp;lifetime, it is pretty clear that his case was very weak.&nbsp;His son simply says that he was “mécontent des acteurs,”&nbsp;which indeed is self-evident. It is certain that Molière and&nbsp;he ceased to be friends in consequence of this proceeding ;&nbsp;and that Molière was in fault no one who has studied the&nbsp;character of the two men, no one even who considers the&nbsp;probabilities of the case, will easily believe. If, however,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Alexandre</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> was the occasion of showing the defects of&nbsp;Racine’s character as a man, it raised him vastly in public&nbsp;estimation as a poet. He was now for the first time proposed as a serious rival to Corneille. There is a story,&nbsp;which a credible witness vouches for as Racine’s own, that&nbsp;he read the piece to the author of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cid</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and asked his&nbsp;verdict. Corneille praised the piece highly, but not as a&nbsp;drama, “ Il l’assurait qu’il n’était pas propre a la poésie&nbsp;dramatique.” There is no reason for disbelieving this, for&nbsp;the character of Alexander could not fail to shock Corneille,&nbsp;and he was notorious for not mincing his words. Nor can&nbsp;it be denied that Racine might have been justly hurt,&nbsp;though with a man of more amiable temper the slight would&nbsp;hardly have caused the settled antagonism to Corneille&nbsp;which he displayed. The contrast between the two even&nbsp;at this early period was accurately apprehended and put&nbsp;by Saint Evremond in his masterly </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dissertation sur VAlexandre,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> but this was not published for a year or two. To&nbsp;this day it is the best criticism of the faults of Racine,&nbsp;though not, it may be, of the merits, which had not yet&nbsp;been fully seen. It may be added that in the preface of the&nbsp;printed play the poet showed the extreme sensitiveness to&nbsp;criticism which perhaps excuses, and which certainly often&nbsp;accompanies, a tendency to criticize others. These defects&nbsp;of character showed themselves still more fully in another&nbsp;matter. The Port Royalists, as has been said, detested the&nbsp;theatre, and in January 1666 Nicole, their chief writer*,&nbsp;spoke in one of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lettres sur Visionnaires</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> of dramatic&nbsp;poets as “empoisonneurs publics.” There was absolutely&nbsp;no reason why Racine should fit this cap on his own head ;&nbsp;but he did so, and published immediately a letter to the&nbsp;author. It is very smartly written, and if Racine had contented himself with protesting against the absurd exaggeration of the decriers of the stage there would have been&nbsp;little harm done. But he filled the piece with personalities,&nbsp;telling an absurd story of Mère Angélique Arnauld’s&nbsp;supposed intolerance, drawing a ridiculous picture of Le&nbsp;Maître (a dead man and his own special teacher and friend),&nbsp;and sneering savagely at Nicole himself. The latter made&nbsp;no reply, but two lay adherents of Port Royal took up the&nbsp;quarrel with more zeal than discretion or ability. Racine&nbsp;wrote a second pamphlet as bitter and personal as the first,&nbsp;but less amusing, and was about to publish it when fortunately Boileau, who had been absent from Paris, returned&nbsp;and protested against the publication. It remained accordingly unprinted till after the author’s death, as well as a</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
