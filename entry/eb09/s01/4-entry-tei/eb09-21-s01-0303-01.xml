The etymology of the word is very uncertain. The most probable account is that the dance was named after its inventor—a celebrated dancer</p><pb xml:id="eb09-21-s01-0304" facs="encyclopediabrit21newyrich_raw_0324.jp2"/><p>of Seville, called Zarabanda. During the 16th and 17th centuries the saraband was exceedingly popular, alike in Spain, France, Italy, and England. Its music was in triple time—generally with three minims in the bar—and almost always consisted of two strains, each beginning upon the first beat, and most frequently ending on the second or third. Many very fine examples of it will be found among the <hi rend="italic">Suites</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Partitas</hi> of Handel and J. S. Bach; but by far the finest we possess is that which Handel first composed for his overture to <hi rend="italic">Almira,</hi> and afterwards adapted to the words “Lascia, ch’io pianga,” in <hi rend="italic">Rinaldo.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
