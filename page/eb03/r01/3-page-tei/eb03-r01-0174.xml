There can be no evidence that any traditional revelation is of divine original, in the words we receive it, and the fenſe we underſtand it, ſo clear and ſo certain as that of the principles of reaſon: and, there-fore, nothing that is contrary to the clear and fclf-evident dictates of reafon, has a right to be urged or affented to as a matter of faith, wherein reafon has 'nothing to do.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Revelation </hi><hi rend="italic">oſ St John.</hi>  See Atocalvpsε.

Revenge, on the contrary, is a cool and deliberate wicked-neſs, and is often executed years after the offence was given ; and the defire of it is generally the effect of •littleneſs, weakneſs, and vice ; while, to do right, and to fnffer wrong, is an argument of a great ſoul, that ſcorns to ſtoop to ſuggeſted revenges.</p><p>Revenge is but a frailty incident</p><p>To craz’d and fickly minds ; the poor content</p><p>of little fouls, unable to ſurmount</p><p>An injury, too weak to bear affront.    <hi rend="italic">Dryden.</hi></p><p>Revenge is generally the concomitant of ſavage minds, of minds implacable, and capable of the moſt horrid barbarities ; unable to fet any limits to their dif-pleafure, they can confine their anger within no bounds of reaſon.</p><p>Cruel revenge, which ſtill we find</p><p>The wcakeſt frailty of a feeble mind.</p><p>Degenerous paſſion, and for man too bafe,</p><p>It ſeats its empire in the favage race.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Juvenal.</hi></p><p>The inſtitution of law prevents the execution of private revenge, and the growth of civilization ſhows its impropriety. Though in modern times a ſpecies of revenge is ſanctioned by what is called the law of honour, which evades the law of the land indeed, but which is equally mean and diſgraceful as the other kinds, and is of conſequences equally baneful.

This revenue is either <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">extraordinary.</hi></p><p>I. The king’s <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi>  revenue is ſuch as has either ſubliſted time out of mind in the crown.; or elfe has been granted by parliament, by way of purchaſe or exchange for ſuch of the king’s inherent hereditary revenues as were found inconvenient to the ſubject.— In faying that it has ſubfiſted time out of mind in the χrown, we do not mean that the king is at pre</p><lb/><p>ſent in the actual poſſeſſion of the whole of his revenue. Much (nay the greateſt part) of it is at this day in the hands of ſubjects ; to whom it has been grant-ed out from time to time by the kings of England : which has rendered the crown in ſome meafure dependent on the people for its ordinary ſupport and ſub-fiſtenee. So that we muſt be obliged to recount, as part of the royal revenue, what lords of manors and other ſubjects frequently look upon to be their own abſolute rights ; becaufe they and their anceſtors are and have been veſted in them for ages, though in reality originally derived from the grants of our ancient princes.</p><p>1.    The firſt of the king’s ordinary revenues, which may be taken notice of, is of an ecclefiaſtical kind (as are alfo the three ſucceeding ones), viz. the cuſtody of the temporalities of biſhops. See Temporalities.</p><p>2.    The king is entitled to a corody, as the law calls it, out of every biſhopric ; that is, to fend one of his chaplains to be maintained by the biſhop, or to have a penfion allowed him till the biſhop promotes him to a benefice. This is alfo in the nature of an acknowledgement to the king, as founder of the ſee, fince he had formerly the ſame corody or penfion from every abbey or priory of royal foundation. It is ſuppofed to be now fallen into total diſuſe } though Sir Matthew Hale fays, that it is due of common right, and that no preſcrip-tion will diſcharge it.</p><p>3.    The king alfo is entitled to all the tithes ari-fing in extraparochial places : though perhaps it may be doubted how far this article, as well as the laſt, can be properly reckoned a part of the king’s own royal revenue ; fince a corody ſupports only his chaplains, and thefe extraparochial tithes are held under an im-plied truſt that the king will diſtribute them for the good of the clergy in general.</p><p>4.    The next branch confiſts in the firft-fru⅛s and tenths of all ſpiritual preferments in the kingdom. See Tenths.</p><p>5.    The next bιanch of the king’s ordinary revenue (which, as well as the ſubſequent branches, is of a lay or temporal nature) conſiſts in the rents and profits of the demeſne lands of the crown. Theſe demefne lands, <hi rend="italic">terra dominicales refits,</hi>  being either the ſhare reſerved to the crown at the original diſtribution of landed property, or ſuch as came to it afterwards by forfeitures or other means, were anciently very large and exten-five ; comprifing divers manors, honours, and lord-ſhips ; the tenants of which had very peculiar privi-leges, when we ſpeak of the tenure in ancient demeſne. At prefent they are contracted within a very narrow compaſs, having bcen almoſt entirely granted away to private ſubjects. This has occafioned the parliament frequently to interpole ; and particularly after King william III. had greatly impoveriſhed the crown, an act paſſed, whereby all future grants or leaſes from the crown for any longer term than 31 years or three lives, are declared to be void ;■ except with regard to houſes, which may be granted for 50 years. And no rever-fionary leaſe can be made, ſo as to exceed, together with the eſtate in being, the ſame term of three lives or 31 years ; that is, when there is a ſubfiſting leafe, of which there are 20 years ſtill to come, the king can-not grant a future intereſt, to commence after the ex-piration of the former, for any longer term than 11</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
