<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">finally </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dwne dvpalais.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Talleyrand was a particular admirer of hers, and she was generally recognized as a woman of&nbsp;great intellectual capacity as well as of much personal grace&nbsp;and charm. After her death (1824) an </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fssai sur&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">VLfucation des Femmes</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> was published and received an&nbsp;academic </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">couronne.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> But it was not till 1879, when her&nbsp;grandson M. Paul de Remusat published her memoirs,&nbsp;which have since been followed by some correspondence&nbsp;with her son, that justice could be generally done to her&nbsp;literary talent. The light thrown on the Napoleonic court&nbsp;by this remarkable book was great, and !Madame de&nbsp;Remusat appeared as hardly the inferior of the best&nbsp;memoir and letter writers of the previous century. The&nbsp;same documents contained much information on the youth&nbsp;and education of her son Charles. He very early developed&nbsp;political views more decidedly Liberal than those of his&nbsp;parents, and, being bred to the bar, published in 1820&nbsp;a short pamphlet on jury trial. He was also an active&nbsp;journalist, showing in philosophy and literature the special&nbsp;influence of Cousin. He was, however, at the same time&nbsp;a thorough man of the world, and is said to have furnished&nbsp;to no small extent the original of Balzac’s brilliant egoist&nbsp;Henri de Marsay. He took no active part in politics&nbsp;till the revolution of July, when he signed the journalists’&nbsp;protest against the Ordinances, and in the following&nbsp;October was elected deputy for Toulouse. He then&nbsp;ranked himself with the “doctrinaires,” and supported&nbsp;(being a speaker of no small power) most of those&nbsp;measures of restriction on popular liberty which rapidly&nbsp;made the July monarchy unpopular with French Radicals.&nbsp;In 1836 he became under-secretary of state for the interior,&nbsp;but did not hold the post lo<sub>v</sub>ng. He then became an ally of&nbsp;Thiers, and in 1840 held the ministry of the interior for a&nbsp;short time. In the same year he became an Academician.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">For the rest of Louis Philippe’s reign lie was in opposition till he joined Thiers in his brief and hopeless attempt at a&nbsp;ministry in the spring of 1848. During this time Remusat&nbsp;constantly spoke in the chamber, but was still more active&nbsp;in literature, especially on philosophical subjects,—the most&nbsp;remarkable of his works being his book on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Abélard</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1845).&nbsp;In 1848 he was elected, and in 1849 re-elected, for the&nbsp;department of Haute Garonne and sat on the Conservative&nbsp;side. But he would not support Louis Napoleon, and had&nbsp;to leave France after the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">coup d’état ;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> nor did he re-enter&nbsp;political life at all during the second empire, though his son&nbsp;M. Paul de Remusat stood for the Haute Garonne, and was&nbsp;very nearly elected, in 1869. Nor would he at first accept&nbsp;the advances made him after the establishment of the third&nbsp;republic. In 1871 he was appointed minister of foreign&nbsp;affairs and accepted the post. Although minister he was&nbsp;not a deputy, and on standing for Paris in September 1873&nbsp;he was beaten by M. Barodet. A month later he was&nbsp;elected (having already resigned with Thiers) for the Haute&nbsp;Garonne by a very great majority. He died at Paris on&nbsp;the 6th April 1875.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">During his long abstention from political life Remusat continued to write on his favourite subjects of philosophical history and&nbsp;especially English philosophical history. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Saint Anselme de Cantor-béry</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">appeared in 1854 ; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">L’Angleterre au XVII Feme siècle</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">in 1856&nbsp;(2d ed. enlarged, 1865); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bacon, sa vie, son temps, dec.,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">in 1858 ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Channing, sa vie et ses œuvres,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">in 1862; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">John Wesley</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">in 1870;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lord Herbert of Chcrbury</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">in 1874 ; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire de la philosophie en&nbsp;Angleterre depuis Bacon jusqu’à Locke,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">in 1875 ; besides other and&nbsp;minor works. The impression derived from these and from the&nbsp;political records of his life is that he was on the whole one of those&nbsp;men whose performances are unequal to their powers. He wrote&nbsp;well, was a forcible speaker, and an acute critic ; but his adoption&nbsp;of the indeterminate eclecticism of Cousin in philosophy and of the&nbsp;somewhat similarly indeterminate liberalism of Thiers in politics&nbsp;probably had a bad effect on him, though both no doubt accorded&nbsp;with his critical and unenthusiastic turn of mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">)ENAISSANCE is a term which lias recently come into i) use to indicate a well-known but indefinite space&nbsp;of time and a certain phase in the development of the&nbsp;European races. On the one hand it denotes the transition from that period of history which we call the Middle&nbsp;Ages to that which we call !Modern. On the other hand&nbsp;it implies those changes in the intellectual and moral&nbsp;attitude of the Western nations by which the transition&nbsp;w<sup>r</sup>as characterized. If we insist upon the literal meaning&nbsp;of the word, the Renaissance was a re-birth ; and it is&nbsp;needful to inquire of what it was the re-birth. The&nbsp;metaphor of Renaissance may signify the entrance of the&nbsp;European nations upon a fresh stage of vital energy in&nbsp;general, implying a fuller consciousness and a freer exercise&nbsp;of faculties than had belonged to the mediaeval period. Or&nbsp;it may mean the resuscitation of simply intellectual activities, stimulated by the revival of antique learning and its&nbsp;application to the arts and literatures of modern peoples.&nbsp;Upon our choice between these two interpretations of the&nbsp;word depend important differences in any treatment of the&nbsp;subject. The former has the disadvantage of making it&nbsp;difficult to separate the Renaissance from other historical&nbsp;phases—the Reformation, for example—with which it ought&nbsp;not to be confounded. The latter has the merit of assigning a specific name to a limited series of events and group&nbsp;of facts, which can be distinguished for the purpose of&nbsp;analysis from other events and facts with which they are&nbsp;intimately but not indissolubly connected. In other&nbsp;words, the one definition of Renaissance makes it denote&nbsp;the whole change which came over Europe at the close of&nbsp;the Middle Ages. The other confines it to what was&nbsp;known &quot;by our ancestors as the Revival of Learning. Yet,&nbsp;when we concentrate attention on the recovery of antique&nbsp;culture, we become aware that this was only one phenomenon or symptom of a far wider and more comprehensive alteration in the conditions of the European races.&nbsp;We find it needful to retain both terms, Renaissance and&nbsp;Revival of Learning, and to show the relations between the&nbsp;series of events and facts which they severally imply.&nbsp;The Revival of Learning must be regarded as a function&nbsp;of that vital energy, an organ of that mental evolution,&nbsp;which brought the modern world, with its new conceptions&nbsp;of philosophy and religion, its re-awakened arts and&nbsp;sciences, its firmer grasp on the realities of human nature&nbsp;and the world, its manifold inventions and discoveries, its&nbsp;altered political systems, its expansive and progressive&nbsp;forces, into being. Important as the Revival of Learning&nbsp;undoubtedly was, there are essential factors in the complex called the Renaissance with which it can but remotely&nbsp;be connected. When we analyse the whole group of phenomena which have to be considered, we perceive that some&nbsp;of the most essential have nothing or little to do with the&nbsp;recovery of the classics. These are, briefly speaking, the&nbsp;decay of those great fabrics, church and empire, which&nbsp;ruled the Middle Ages both as ideas and as realities; the&nbsp;appearance of full-formed nationalities and languages; the&nbsp;enfeeblement of the feudal system throughout Europe; the&nbsp;invention and application of paper, the mariner’s compass,&nbsp;gunpowder, and printing; the exploration of continents&nbsp;beyond the ocean; and the substitution of the Copernican&nbsp;for the Ptolemaic system of astronomy. Europe in fact&nbsp;had been prepared for a thorough-going metamorphosis&nbsp;before that new ideal of human life and culture which&nbsp;the Revival of Learning brought to light had been made</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
