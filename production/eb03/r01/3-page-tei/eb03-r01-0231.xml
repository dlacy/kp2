To add to the dignity of this new inſtitution, his majeſty conferred on the preſident the honour of knighthood ; and Sir Joſhua delivered his ſirſt diſcourſe at the opening of the Academy on Januar)' 2. 1769. The merit of that diſcourſe has been univerfally admitted among painters ; but it contains ſome directions reſpecting the proper mode of proſecuting their ſtudies, to which every ſtu-dent of every art would do well to pay attention. “ I would chiefly recommend (ſays he), that an implicit obedience to the <hi rend="italic">rules of art,</hi>  as eſtabliſhed by the prac-tice of the great maſters, ſhould be exacted from the young ſtudents. That thoſe models, which have paſſed through the approbation of ages, ſhould be conſidered by them as perfect and infallible guides; as fubjects for their imitation, not tlieir criticiſm. I am confident, that this is tlie only efficacious method of making a progreſs in tlie arts ; and that lie who ſets out with doubting, will find life finiſhed before he becomes maſſer of the rudiments. For it may be laid down as a maxim, that be who begins by preſuming on his own ſenſe, has ended his ſtudies as ſoon as he has commenced them. Every opportunity, therefore, ſhould be taken to dif-countenance that falſe and vulgar opinion, that rules are the fetters of genius. They are fetters only to men ■of no genius ; as that armour which, upon the ſtrong, becomes an ornament and a defence, upon the weak and iniſhapen turns into a load, and cripples the body which it was made to protect.”</p><p>Each ſucceeding year, on the diſtribution of the prizes, Sir Joſhua delivered to tlie ſtudents a diſcourſe of equal merit with this : and perhaps we do not hazard too much when we ſay, that, from the whole col-lected, the lover of belles lettres and the fine arts will acquire juſter notions oſ what is meant by taſte in ge-r.eral, and better rules for acquiring a correct taſte, than from multitudes of thoſe volumes which have been profeſſedly written on the ſubject.</p><p>In the autumn of 1785 he went to Bruſſels, where he expended about L. 1000 on the purchaſe of paint-ingg, which, having been taken from the different mo-naſterſes and religious houſes in Flanders and Germany, were then expoſed to ſale by tbe command of the Em-peror Joſeph ! Gainſborough and he had engaged to paint each other’s portrait; and the canvas for both being actually ſtretched, Sir Joſhua gave one fitting to his diſtinguiſhed rival ; but, to the regret of every ad-mirer of the art, the unexpected death of the latter pre-vented all further progreſs.</p><p>In 1790 he was anxiouſſy deſirous to procure the vacant profefforſhip of perſpective in the academy for Mr Bonomi, an Italian architect ; but that artiſt not having been yet elected, an affociate was of courſe no academician, and it became neceſſary to raife him to thoſe ſituations, in order to qualify him for being a profeffor. Mr Gilpin being his competitor for the affociateſhip, the numbers on the ballot proved equal, when the preſident by bis caſting vote decided the election in favour of his friend, who was thereby advanced ſo far towards the profeſſorſhip. Soon after this, an academic ſeat be-ing vacant, Sir Joſhua exerted all his influence to ob-tain it for Mr Bonomi ; but finding himſelf outvoted by a majority of two to one, he quitted the chair with great diſſatisſaction, and next day ſent to the fecretary of th&amp;academy a formal reſignation of the office, which for twenty-one years he had filled with honour to himſelf and his country. His indignation, however, ſub-ſiding, he ſuffered himſelf to be prevailed upon to re-turn to the chair, which within a year and a half he was again deſirous to quit for a better reaſon.</p><p>Finding a diſeaſe of languor, occaſioned by an en-largementof the liver, to wliich he had for ſome time been ſubject, increaſe upon him, and daily expecting the total loſs of ſight, he wrote a letter to the academy, inti-mating his intention to reſign the office of preſident on account of bodily infirmities, which difabled him from executing the duties of it to his own ſatisſaction. The academicians received this intelligence with the reſpect-ful concern due to the talents and virtues of their pre-ſident ; and either then did enter, or deſigned to enter, into a refolution, honourable to all parties, namely, that a deputation from the whole body of the academy ſhould wait upon him, jand inform him of their wiſh, that the authority and privileges of the office of preſident might be his during his life ; declaring their willingneſs to permit the performance of any of its duties which might be irkſome to him by a deputy.</p><p>From this period Sir Joſhua never painted more. The laſt effort of his pencil was the portrait of the Honourable Charles James Fox, which was executed in his</p><p>patra diffolving the Pearl; Garrick in the character of Kitely ; Garrick between Tragedy and Comedy ; Mrs Abingdon in the character of Comedy,; a Child ſurrounded by Guardian Angels ; Miſs Beauclerc in the cha-racter of Spenſer’s Una ; Reſignation ; the Ducheſs of Mancheſter in the character of Diana ; Lady Blake in the charaôler of Juno ; Mrs Sheridan in the character of St Cecilia ; Edwin, horn Beattie’s Minſtrel ; the Nativity, hour Cardinal Virtues, and Faith, Hope, and Charity, for the window of New College Chapel, Ox-ford ; the Studious Boy ; a Bacchante ; a daughter of Lord W.
