<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">enacted that a uniform household franchise and a uniform lodger franchise at elections shall be established in all counties and&nbsp;boroughs throughout the United Kingdom, and every man possessed of a household qualification or a lodger qualification shall, if&nbsp;the qualifying premises be situated in a county in England or Scotland, be entitled to be registered as a voter, and, when registered,&nbsp;to vote at an election for such county, and, if the qualifying premises be situated in a county or borough in Ireland, be entitled to&nbsp;be registered as a voter and, when registered, to vote at an election&nbsp;for such county or borough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A main practical effect of the Act of 1884 was to extend to counties the franchise previously confined to boroughs in respect&nbsp;of inhabitant occupiers of dwelling houses, and in respect of the&nbsp;occupation of lodgings. At the same time the franchise in respect&nbsp;of occupation of lands and tenements (other than a household&nbsp;franchise) was assimilated in boroughs and counties and fixed at&nbsp;£10 a year. Independently of this extension to counties and&nbsp;assimilation of the household and lodger franchise, provision was&nbsp;made for extending the franchise to many cases of the inhabitancy&nbsp;of houses by persons who, in consequence of filling offices or serving&nbsp;others or of the tenure of the house, were deprived of the franchise,&nbsp;not being in law occupiers. This is commonly spoken of as the&nbsp;service franchise. On the other hand restrictions were placed on&nbsp;faggot votes in respect of rent charges. Moreover, a man is not&nbsp;entitled by virtue of the Act to be registered as a county voter in&nbsp;respect of the occupation of any dwelling house, land, or tenement&nbsp;situate in a borough. This Act was shortly followed by the&nbsp;Registration Act, 1885, assimilating the registration law applicable&nbsp;to the borough and county occupation franchises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The procedure for the formation of the register, as well in counties as in boroughs, is still very complicated. In counties&nbsp;there are two classes of persons entitled to be registered—the one&nbsp;ownership voters, the other occupation voters. General but&nbsp;detailed instructions are sent by the clerk of the peace to overseers,&nbsp;accompanied by forms and copies of the existing register. On or&nbsp;before the 20th June the overseers publish the ownership portion&nbsp;of the then existing register for the parish, at the same time giving&nbsp;notice in a prescribed form that all persons entitled to be registered&nbsp;in counties in respect of the ownership of property within the parish&nbsp;and not upon the register, or whose qualification or address has&nbsp;changed, who are desirous of having their names inserted in the&nbsp;register, must give notice to the overseers in a prescribed published&nbsp;form by the 20th July. A list of such ownership claimants is published by the end of July. The occupation voters now entitled in&nbsp;counties to be on the register comprise a £10 occupation qualification and principally a household qualification, and also a lodger&nbsp;qualification. The occupation list other than that of lodgers is&nbsp;made out and published by the overseers. They are required to&nbsp;get the information, and as this information cannot be gathered in&nbsp;many cases from the rate books, they may require rated persons to&nbsp;supply them with the names of all inhabitant occupiers of their&nbsp;dwelling houses so that such persons (including chielly the service franchise already mentioned) may be entered in a separate&nbsp;column of the rate book. The lodger list is made out by the&nbsp;overseers from an existing list, if there be one (for in counties&nbsp;there can be no existing list before 1886), and by claims. In cities&nbsp;and boroughs the franchises (where there are no freemen) are chiefly&nbsp;occupation franchises, and the same general system of registration&nbsp;prevails as in counties in relation to the registration or occupation&nbsp;franchises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">With the exception of the provisions relating to the so-called service franchise already noticed, registration procedure has not&nbsp;been much changed by the legislation of 1884 and 1885, and in&nbsp;counties as well as in boroughs it mainly rests still on the Registration Act of 1843. Overseers receive their precepts in boroughs&nbsp;from the town clerk, as they do in counties from the clerks of the&nbsp;peace, and the town clerk deals with the lists of freemen where that&nbsp;description of franchise exists. As the household occupation and&nbsp;lodger franchises were introduced into boroughs in 1867, the preparation and publication of lists as to occupation franchises rests&nbsp;principally on the same procedure in counties and boroughs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Ample facilities are given for fresh and amended claims and for objections made (by any one on the register) to the overseers by the&nbsp;20th August and published by them in lists; and, where payment of&nbsp;poor rates is essential, not necessarily by the voter, but by some&nbsp;one (as in some occupation franchises it is), a list of persons disqualified is made out and open to inspection. While the actual&nbsp;exercise of the franchise is governed by the duration of the register&nbsp;(which in the absence of special legislation, as adopted for 1868 and&nbsp;for 1885, is in force for the ordinary year, viz., from 1st January),&nbsp;every period of qualification is computed by reference to the 15th&nbsp;July ; the qualification must be complete on that day, whether or&nbsp;not it comprises a possession or occupation for a previous definite&nbsp;fixed period. When payment of poor rates is part of a qualification,&nbsp;payment before the 15tli July of rates payable to the 15th January&nbsp;is sufficient. Disqualifications generally refer to their existence at&nbsp;the same date. As regards parochial relief, any relief within twelve&nbsp;months of the 15th July disqualifies. Even with regard to disqualification by office, which may be transitory and disconnected with&nbsp;the qualifying franchise, the existence of the disqualification on the&nbsp;15th July is a bar to registration. Where a man is registered by&nbsp;virtue of one qualification he cannot be also registered to vote by&nbsp;reason of another in respect of the same property, and a qualification&nbsp;franchise under the Representation of the People Act, 1884, generally overrides another description of qualification; but fine distinctions sometimes exist between inhabitancy and residence in relation&nbsp;to different qualifications affecting the right to be on the register&nbsp;in respect of one description of occupation franchise rather than&nbsp;another. In a borough divided under the Redistribution of Scats&nbsp;Act, 1885, a person cannot be registered in more than one division.&nbsp;The duties of overseers in reference to registration extend from&nbsp;spring to autumn. By the 25tli of August the lists are delivered&nbsp;by them to the clerk of the peace in counties, and in boroughs to&nbsp;the town clerk. Barristers are appointed to revise the lists and&nbsp;hold courts for that purpose (and also for revising the municipal&nbsp;franchise) between the 15th September and 31st October, giving&nbsp;notice to the clerks of the peace in counties and town clerks of&nbsp;boroughs, who publish notice of the sittings appointed and attend&nbsp;and deliver the lists, the overseers also attending. They hold open&nbsp;courts (the localities including all polling places in counties) on&nbsp;appointed days, with evening sittings in populous places, with,&nbsp;general powers of adjournment. A right of appeal exists from a&nbsp;revising barrister’s decision on the points of law, by a claimant&nbsp;or objector, to judges of the High Court of Justice. Whether the&nbsp;right of appeal is exercised or not, the lists, as settled and signed&nbsp;by the barrister, are transmitted by him to the clerk of the peace&nbsp;or town clerk as the case may be. The lists are copied and printed&nbsp;in such manner and form that the list of voters for every parish&nbsp;appeals separately and with reference to polling places. By the&nbsp;end of December the printed lists signed by the clerk of the peace&nbsp;are delivered to the sheriff of the county, and signed borough lists&nbsp;are delivered by the town clerk to the returning officer. The&nbsp;register is thus completed, and the book constitutes the register of&nbsp;persons entitled to vote for the county or borough to which it&nbsp;relates at any election which takes place during the year commencing on the 1st January next after such register is made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">For some years after the passing of the Reform Act, 1832, an elector was allowed, previous to voting, to be interrogated as to&nbsp;the possession of the qualification for which his name was inserted&nbsp;on the register; but since 1843 no inquiry is permitted at the&nbsp;time of polling as to the right of any person to vote, except as&nbsp;to his identity with the name appearing on the register and as to&nbsp;his having already voted ; he may be required to give his answers&nbsp;on oath, but without an oath a false answer wilfully made is&nbsp;an indictable misdemeanour. With this exception it is unlawful&nbsp;to require any voter to take an oath in proof of his qualification&nbsp;or right to vote, or to reject any vote tendered by any person&nbsp;whose name is upon the register ; and no scrutiny is allowed by&nbsp;or before any returning officer with regard to any vote given or&nbsp;tendered at an election. A great effort, partially successful, was&nbsp;made in 1885 to transfer the cost of forming the register from&nbsp;local to imperial funds. A part of the cost is now borne by&nbsp;the state. The remuneration of revising barristers is paid by the&nbsp;treasury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Scotland.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> —In Scotland as in England a system of registration was established in 1832 (2 &amp; 3 Will. IV. c. 65), aud, passing over&nbsp;amendments on the extension and assimilation of county and&nbsp;burgh franchises by the Representation of the People Act, 1884,&nbsp;establishing a general household qualification in the United&nbsp;Kingdom, the principles of registration adopted in England by the&nbsp;Registration Act, 1885, were applied with some modifications to&nbsp;Scotland by the Registration Amendment (Sccitland) Act, 1885.&nbsp;An annual revision of the register (founded on the valuation roll)&nbsp;is made by appointed officers, with the publication of lists and of&nbsp;names of parties interested making claims and objections. Instead,&nbsp;however, of the duties of publication and primary correction being&nbsp;in the hands of the parish officers, as in England, those duties&nbsp;devolve as before on assessors (aided in burghs by the town clerks),&nbsp;who make up the register. The duties of final revision devolve on&nbsp;the sheriff, who authenticates the register, and it is delivered to&nbsp;the sheriff clerk with the names duly arranged. The principal&nbsp;expenses of registration are provided from local or county sources,&nbsp;with a contribution from imperial funds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">.—In Ireland also the registration of voters was a feature of the reform in parliament effected in 1832, and the same gene;al&nbsp;features as to the formation and amendment of the register prevail&nbsp;as in England. The extension and assimilation of the franchise&nbsp;by the Representation of the People Act, 1884, is carried out by&nbsp;the Parliamentary Registration (Ireland) Act, 1885, on the same&nbsp;lines as before, only adapted to peculiar exigencies. Clerks of&nbsp;poor-law unions have still many of the duties of parochial officers&nbsp;in England. Prominent among recent divergencies is the proviso&nbsp;that temporary eviction for non-payment of rent followed by&nbsp;reinstalment does not disqualify a claim to occupation franchise.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
