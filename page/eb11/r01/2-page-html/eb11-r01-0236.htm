<p><span class="font0">REFORMED CHURCH IN THE UNITED STATES, a </span><span class="font1">German Calvinistic church in America, commonly called the German Reformed Church. It traces its origin to the great&nbsp;German immigration of the 17th century, especially to&nbsp;Pennsylvania, where, although the German Lutherans afterwards&nbsp;outnumbered them, the Reformed element was estimated in&nbsp;1730 to be more than half the whole number of Germans in the&nbsp;colony. In 1709 more than 2000 Palatines emigrated to New&nbsp;York with their pastor, Johann Friedrich Hager (d. c. 1723), who&nbsp;laboured in the Mohawk Valley. A church in Germantown,&nbsp;Virginia, was founded about 1714. Johann Philip Boehm&nbsp;(d. 1749), a school teacher from Worms, although not ordained,&nbsp;preached after 1725 to congregations at Falckner’s Swamp,&nbsp;Skippack, and White Marsh, Pennsylvania, and in 1729 he was&nbsp;ordained by Dutch Reformed ministers in New York. Georg&nbsp;Michael Weiss (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font1">. 1700-</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font1">. 1762), a graduate of Heidelberg,&nbsp;ordained and sent to America by the Upper Consistory of the&nbsp;Palatinate in 1727, organized a church in Philadelphia; preached&nbsp;at Skippack; worked in Dutchess and Schoharie counties, New&nbsp;York, in 1731-46; and then returned to his old field in&nbsp;Pennsylvania. Johann Heinrich Goetschius was pastor&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(c.</span><span class="font1"> 1731-38) of ten churches in Pennsylvania, and was ordained&nbsp;by the Presbyterian Synod of Philadelphia in 1737. A part of&nbsp;his work was undertaken by Johann Conrad Wirtz, who&nbsp;was ordained by the New Brunswick (New Jersey) Presbytery&nbsp;in 1750, and in 1761-63 was pastor at York, Pennsylvania.&nbsp;A church was built in 1736 at Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where&nbsp;Johann Bartholomaeus Rieger (1707-1769), who came from&nbsp;Germany with Weiss on his return in 1731, had preached for&nbsp;several years. Michael Schlatter (1716-1790), a Swiss of St&nbsp;Gall, sent to America in 1746 by the Synods (Dutch Reformed)&nbsp;of Holland, immediately convened Boehm, Weiss and Rieger&nbsp;in Philadelphia, and with them planned a Coetus, which first&nbsp;met in September 1747; in 1751 he presented the cause of the&nbsp;Coetus in Germany and Holland, where he gathered funds; in&nbsp;1752 came back to America with six ministers, one of whom,&nbsp;William Stoy (1726-1801), was an active opponent of the&nbsp;Coetus and of clericalism after 1772. Thereafter Schlatter’s&nbsp;work was in the charity schools of Pennsylvania, which the&nbsp;people thought were tinged with Episcopalianism. Many&nbsp;churches and pastors were independent of the Coetus, notably&nbsp;John Joachim Zubly (1724-1781), of St Gall, who migrated to&nbsp;S. Carolina in 1726, and was a delegate to the Continental&nbsp;Congress from Georgia, but opposed independence and was&nbsp;banished from Savannah in 1777. Within the Coetus there were&nbsp;two parties. Of the Pietists of the second class one of the&nbsp;leaders was Philip William Otterbein (1726-1813), born in&nbsp;Dillenburg, Nassau, whose system of class-meetings was the&nbsp;basis of a secession from which grew the United Brethren in&nbsp;Christ, commonly called the “New Reformed Church,” organized&nbsp;in 1800. During the War of Independence the Pennsylvania members of the Church were mostly attached to the American&nbsp;cause, and Nicholas Herkimer and Baron von Steuben were&nbsp;both Reformed; but in New York and in the South there were&nbsp;many German Loyalists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Franklin College was founded by Lutherans and Reformed, with much outside help, notably that of Benjamin Franklin,&nbsp;at Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1787.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Coetus had actually assumed the power of ordination in 1772 and formally assumed it in 1791; in 1792 a synodical&nbsp;constitution was prepared; and in 1793 the first independent&nbsp;synod met in Lancaster and adopted the constitution, thus&nbsp;becoming independent of Holland. Its churches numbered&nbsp;178, and there were about 15,000 communicants. The strongest&nbsp;churches were those of Philadelphia, Lancaster and Germantown&nbsp;in Pennsylvania, and Frederick in Maryland. The German&nbsp;Reformed churches in Lunenburg county, Nova Scotia, became&nbsp;Presbyterian in 1837; a German church in Waldoboro, Maine,&nbsp;after a century, became Congregational in 1850. The New&nbsp;York churches became Dutch Reformed. The New Jersey&nbsp;churches rapidly fell away, becoming Presbyterian, Dutch&nbsp;Reformed, or Lutheran. In Virginia many churches became&nbsp;Episcopalian and others United Brethren. By 1825, 13 Reformed ministers were settled W. of the Alleghanies. The&nbsp;Synod in 1819 divided itself into eight Classes. In 1824 the&nbsp;Classis of Northampton, Pennsylvania (13 ministers and 80&nbsp;congregations), became the Synod of Ohio, the parent Synod&nbsp;having refused to allow the Classis to ordain. In 1825 there&nbsp;were 87 ministers, and in the old Synod about 23,300 communicants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A schism over the establishment of a theological seminary resulted in the organization of a new synod of the “ Free German&nbsp;Reformed Congregations of Pennsylvania,” which returned to&nbsp;the parent synod in 1837.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">John Winebrenner </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font1"> pastor in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, left the Church in 1828, and in 1830 organized the “ Church of&nbsp;God ”; his main doctrinal difference with the Reformed Church&nbsp;was on infant baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1825 the Church opened a theological seminary at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, affiliated with Dickinson College. James Ross&nbsp;Reily (1788-1844) travelled in Holland and Germany, collecting&nbsp;money and books for the seminary. It was removed in 1829&nbsp;to York, where an academy was connected with it; in 1835&nbsp;the academy (which in 1836 became Marshall College) and in&nbsp;1837 the seminary removed to Mercersburg, where, in 1840,&nbsp;John W. Nevin </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font1"> became its president, and with Philip&nbsp;Schaff </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font1"> founded the Mercersburg theology, which lost to&nbsp;the Church many who objected to Nevin’s (and Schaff’s)&nbsp;Romanizing tendencies. The seminary was removed in 1871&nbsp;from Mercersburg to Lancaster, whither the college had gone&nbsp;in 1853 to form, with Franklin College, Franklin and Marshall&nbsp;College.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1842 the Western Synod </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.</span><span class="font1"> the Synod of Ohio) adopted the constitution of the Eastern, and divided into classes. It&nbsp;founded in 1850 a theological school and Heidelberg University&nbsp;at Tiffin, Ohio. The Synods organized a General Synod in&nbsp;1863. New German Synods were: that of the North-West&nbsp;(1867), organized at Fort Wayne, Ind.; that of the East (1875),&nbsp;organized at Philadelphia; and the Central Synod (1881),&nbsp;organized at Galion, Ohio. New English Synods were: that of&nbsp;Pittsburg (1870); that of the Potomac (1873); and that of the&nbsp;Interior (1887), organized at Kansas City, Missouri. In 1894&nbsp;there were eight district synods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After a long controversy over a liturgy (connected in part with the Mercersburg controversy) a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Directory of Worship </span><span class="font1">was&nbsp;adopted in 1887.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The principal organizations of the Church are: the Board of Publication (1844); the Society for the Relief of Ministers and their&nbsp;Widows (founded in 1755 by the Pennsylvania Coetus; incorporated&nbsp;in 1810; transferred to the Synod in 1833); a Board of Domestic&nbsp;Missions (1826); a Board of Foreign Missions (1838; reorganized&nbsp;in 1873), which planted a mission in Japan (1879), now a part of&nbsp;the Union Church of Japan, and one in China (1900). The Church&nbsp;has publishing houses in Philadelphia (replacing that of Chambersburg, Pa., founded in 1840 and destroyed in July 1864 by the&nbsp;Confederate army) and in Cleveland, Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Colleges connected with the Church, besides the seminary at Lancaster, Franklin and Marshall College and Heidelberg University,&nbsp;are: Catawba College (1851) at Newton, North Carolina; and Ursinus&nbsp;College (1869), founded by the Low Church wing, at Collegeville,&nbsp;Pennsylvania, which had, until 1908, a theological seminary, then&nbsp;removed to Dayton, Ohio, where it united with Heidelberg&nbsp;Theological Seminary (until 1908 at Tiffin) to form the Central&nbsp;Theological Seminary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1906, according to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin 103</span><span class="font0"> (1909) of the Bureau of the United States Census, the Church had 1736 organizations in the</span></p>
