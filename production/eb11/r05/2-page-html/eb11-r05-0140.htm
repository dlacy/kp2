<p><span class="font2">any impulse from theory, simply as a spontaneous outgrowth of popular life. When workmen from any province come, for instance,&nbsp;to St Petersburg to engage in the textile industries, or to work as&nbsp;carpenters, masons, &amp;c., they immediately unite in groups of ten&nbsp;to fifty persons, settle in a house together, keep a common table&nbsp;and pay each his part of the expense to the elected elder of the&nbsp;artel. All over Russia there is a network of such artels—in the&nbsp;cities, in the forests, on the banks of the rivers, on journeys and&nbsp;even in the prisons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The industrial artel is almost, as frequent as the preceding, in all those trades which admit of it. Artels of one or two hundred&nbsp;carpenters, bricklayers, &amp;c., are common wherever new buildings&nbsp;have to be erected, or railways or bridges constructed; the contractors always prefer to deal with an artel, rather than with&nbsp;separate workmen. It is needless to add that the wages divided&nbsp;by the artels are higher than those earned by isolated workmen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Finally, a great number of artels on the stock exchange, in the seaports, in the great cities, during the great fairs and on railways&nbsp;have grown up, and have acquired the confidence of tradespeople&nbsp;to such an extent that considerable sums of money and complicated&nbsp;banking operations are frequently handed over to an artelshik&nbsp;(member of an artel) without any receipt, his number or his name&nbsp;being accepted as sufficient guarantee. These artels are recruited&nbsp;only on personal acquaintance with the candidates for membership.&nbsp;Co-operative societies have also been organized by several </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">zemstvos.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">They have achieved good results, but do not exhibit, on the whole,&nbsp;the same unity of organization as those which have arisen in a&nbsp;natural way among the peasants and artisans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The chief occupation of approximately seven-eighths of the population of European Russia is agriculture, but its character&nbsp;varies considerably according to the soil, the climate and&nbsp;the geographical position of the different regions. A&nbsp;sinuous line, drawn from Zhitomir via Kiev, Tula and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Kazan to Ufa—that is, from W.S.W. to E.N.E.—separates the “ northern soils ” from the “ southern soils.” To the S. of this&nbsp;line, as far as the sandy deserts of Astrakhan and the steppes of&nbsp;N. Caucasia, lies the “ black earth ” region. Broadly speaking,&nbsp;the forests here yield to steppes, and the soil is very fertile; but&nbsp;the whole region suffers periodically from drought. The &quot; northern&nbsp;soils,” which are glacial deposits more or less redistributed by&nbsp;water, are much less fertile as a rule, and consist of all possible&nbsp;varieties from a tough boulder clay, to loose sand. Both N. and&nbsp;S. of this line it is customary to distinguish several zones, lying,&nbsp;generally, parallel to it, and differentiated chiefly by climatic&nbsp;differences. In the tundras of the extreme N. agriculture does&nbsp;not exist; the reindeer constitutes the principal wealth of the&nbsp;nomad Samoyedes and Lapps. In the forest region S. of the&nbsp;tundras, which extends over an area of more than 500,000 sq. m.,&nbsp;agriculture is carried on with great difficulty, not only because of&nbsp;the infertility of the soil, but also because of the severity of the&nbsp;climate and the fact that there are only three to four months in&nbsp;the year during which agriculture can be carried on. Apart from&nbsp;hunting and fishing, the exploitation of the forests provides the&nbsp;principal occupation of the inhabitants. Crops, chiefly barley,&nbsp;rye, oats, turnips and green crops, are, however, grown on clearings&nbsp;in the forest, though the yield is poor. S. of 60<sup>0</sup> N. agriculture&nbsp;becomes the predominant industry, while the exploitation of the&nbsp;forests plays only a secondary part. In this zone, which extends&nbsp;over an area of nearly 600,000 sq. m., and on the S. touches the&nbsp;agrarian line already mentioned, the principal crops are rye and&nbsp;oats, with barley and wheat coming next, though flax and green&nbsp;crops are also grown. Cattle have to be housed for the winter.&nbsp;In the W. of this zone, that is in the Baltic provinces, the climate&nbsp;is less severe as well as moisten Agriculture is carried on in a more&nbsp;intelligent manner, and the yield is higher. Flax is almost of as&nbsp;much importance as wheat, and the potato is more cultivated than&nbsp;in any other part of Russia. Hardy fruit thrives, and live-stock&nbsp;breeding prospers. In the W. governments of Kovno, Vitebsk,&nbsp;Vilna, Mogilev, Minsk and Grodno the climate is more temperate,&nbsp;but agriculture is more backward than in the Baltic provinces.&nbsp;The three-field system of cropping a patch of land until its fertility&nbsp;is exhausted, and then allowing it to revert to the primeval condition, is still pursued, and both landowners and peasantry suffer&nbsp;from want of capital and lack of agricultural training. Flax is&nbsp;one of the principal exports, of this region, timber being another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In middle Russia the winters are both longer ana harder, and agriculture is consequently carried on under greater difficulties.&nbsp;One of the most serious of these is caused not by the unfavourable&nbsp;character of. the climate but by the shortness of labour. Since&nbsp;their emancipation in 1861, the peasants of the central governments of Russia have in large numbers drifted away into’the black&nbsp;earth zone, or have gone to the factories. The methods of agriculture are still unscientific and unprogressive. Rye is the staple&nbsp;crop, though buckwheat, flax, green crops and the potato are&nbsp;cultivated in considerable quantities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Agriculture 19 most advanced in the W. of the black earth zone, that is in the governments of Kiev, Podolia, Poltava and in part&nbsp;of Kharkov. The winters are less severe, and modern agricultural&nbsp;machinery is generally employed, at all events on the larger estates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In consequence of these more favourable conditions there is greater variety in the cropping; a good deal of wheat is grown, as well&nbsp;as beetroot for sugar, fibre plants and oleaginous plants, fruit,&nbsp;and even (W. of the Dnieper) the vine. Live-stock breeding is&nbsp;likewise in a more prosperous condition. The rest of the black&nbsp;earth zone, which stretches from these governments N.E. to the&nbsp;Volga, is less favoured by nature; the winters are longer and&nbsp;more inclement, and droughts are not uncommon. When this&nbsp;happens there is great suffering from famine, for wheat is the crop&nbsp;upon which the people principally depend, though rye, buckwheat&nbsp;and oats are also cultivated. But a long course of continuous&nbsp;cropping with these grain crops, without affording compensation&nbsp;to the soil in the form of manure or deep cultivation, has so exhausted it that its productiveness has sadly deteriorated. The&nbsp;consequence is that the peasantry are constantly in a state bordering&nbsp;on destitution, and exposed to the horrors of famine, like those&nbsp;which visited them in 1890 and 1898, and threatened in 1907.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">S. of the above zone come the S. steppes. In the W., in Bessarabia, the three chief products are maize, wine and hardy fruit, especially plums. Here the climate is temperate and fairly moist,&nbsp;but farther E. it is distinctly more arid. Wheat is the principal&nbsp;crop, with barley second. Water-melons, sun-flowers and flax,&nbsp;both the last two for oil, are usual crops. . But the breeding of&nbsp;horses and sheep is of equal importance with agriculture. Here&nbsp;again both capital and labour are short, and the cultivation of the&nbsp;soil suffers from the fact that, owing to the absence of timber,&nbsp;dry dung is used for fuel instead of being employed as manure.&nbsp;The steppe conditions extend over the greater part of the Crimea&nbsp;and up to the foothills of the Caucasus..

<p><span class="font2">Down to January ist 1903, the peasants had actually redeemed out of the land allotted to them in 1861 a total of 280,530,516 acres.&nbsp;In Poland the peasants as a body have, in addition to the land&nbsp;thus assigned to them by the government, bought some 2 1/2 million&nbsp;acres since 1863, and of this quantity they purchased no less than&nbsp;1,600,000 acres, or 64% of the whole, between 1893 and 1905.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Taking the whole of European Russia and Poland, almost exactly two-thirds of the total area is sown every year with cereals. But&nbsp;generally in from 18 to 33 out of the 72 governments in European&nbsp;Russia (including Caucasia) and Poland the yield of cereals is not&nbsp;sufficient for the wants of the people. In 30 to 40 governments,&nbsp;however, there is in most years a surplus available for export.&nbsp;Out of the total acreage under cereals 34% is generally sown with&nbsp;rye, 26% with wheat, 20% with oats and 10 1/2% with barley.&nbsp;Beetroot (6-8 million tons annually) for sugar is especially cultivated in Poland, the governments of Kiev, Podolia, Volhynia,&nbsp;Kharkov, Bessarabia and Kherson. About 100,000 tons of&nbsp;tobacco are grown annually in the S. Flax and hemp occupy&nbsp;considerable acreages in central and N.W. Russia. The vine is&nbsp;cultivated as far N. as 49° N. (in Bessarabia,.Crimea,.Don Cossacks&nbsp;territory and Caucasia), the annual production of wine amounting&nbsp;to 35-50 million gallons, three-fifths in Caucasia.
