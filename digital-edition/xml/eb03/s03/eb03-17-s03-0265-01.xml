The ſcales are equal and contiguous, ſo as to ſeem entire ; thoſe at the baſe are few, and have their apices or points decayed. There are 57 ſpecies. Of theſe, ſeven are Britiſh, the vulgaris, viſeoſus, ſylvaticus, erucifolius, jacobæa, paludoſus, and ſaracenicus.</p><p>1. The <hi rend="italic">vulgaris,</hi> or common groundſel, has its corollæ naked, its leaves ſeſſile, ſmooth, and ſinuated, their ſegments ſhort, broad, and minutely ſerrated; the flowers are yellow, and without radii. This weed grows in cultivated ground everywhere, and flowers in May. Its leaves have been uſed in medicine externally as a vulnerary and refrigerant, and internally as a mild emetic ; but they have little or no efficacy. 2.

The <hi rend="italic">paludoſus,</hi> marſh ragwort ; the corollæ are radiant ; the leaves ſword-ſhaped, acutely ſerrated, and ſomewhat downy underneath ; the ſtem is erect, branched towards the top, and four or five feet high ; the flowers are large and yellow.
