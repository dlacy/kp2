a ſea-port town of Kent, in the iſle of Thanet, five miles from Margate, where a very fine pier has been lately built for the ſecurity of ſhips that come into the harbour, being ſeated near the Downs, between the north and fouth Foreland, 10 miles north-ea∙ft of Canterbury. The town is ſituated in the cove of a chalky cliff. It was formerly but an obfcure fiſh-ing village, but ſince the year 1688 has been improved and enlarged by a ſuccefsful trade to Ruſſia and the eaſt country. But what renders it moſt worthy of notice, and attracts multitudes of ſtrangers, is the new harbour, which is one of the moſt capacious in England, if not in Europe. It was begun in the year 1750, but delayed by various interruptions. It con-ſiſts of two piers ; that to the eaſt is built wholly of Purbeck ſtone, and extends itfelf into the ocean near 800 feet before it forms an angle ; its breadth on the top is 26 feet, including a ſtrong parapet wall, which runs along the outſide of it. The other to the weſt is conſtructed of wood as far as the low-water mark, but the reſt is of ſtone. The angles, of which there are five in each pier, conſiſt of 160 feet each, with octa-gons at the end of 60 feet diameter, leaving an en-trance of 200 feet into the harbour, the depth of which admits of a gradual increaſe of 18 to 36 feet.
