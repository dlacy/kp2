<p><span class="font0">Peter were declared joint-sovereigns, and Sophia was to be regent during their minority. She appointed Vasilii&nbsp;Golitzin to be commander-in-chief of the forces. He&nbsp;marched against the Mongols of the Crimea, but owing&nbsp;to the length of the journey and sufferings of the troops&nbsp;w<sup>r</sup>as able to effect but little. In 1689 Peter married&nbsp;Eudokia Lopukhina; but the union was by no means&nbsp;a happy one. Two sons were born to Peter, Alexander&nbsp;and Alexis; the first lived six months only, the latter&nbsp;survived to make a sad figure in Russian history. Next&nbsp;we have another revolt of the streltzî, said to have been&nbsp;instigated by Sophia and Golitzin. It is even alleged&nbsp;that the object of this conspiracy was to put Peter to&nbsp;death. His cause, however, prevailed, and the rebels were&nbsp;punished with great severity. Golitzin’s life was spared,&nbsp;but all his property was taken from him. Sophia was now&nbsp;permanently incarcerated in a convent under the name of&nbsp;Susanna, where she remained till her death fifteen years&nbsp;afterwards, at the age of forty-six. Thus from 1689 dates&nbsp;the actual rule of Peter. His brother Ivan, infirm both in&nbsp;body and mind, had but little share in the government ;&nbsp;his faculties both of sight and speech are said to have&nbsp;been very imperfect. He took a wife, however, and had&nbsp;three daughters, concerning one of whom, at least, we have&nbsp;much more to hear. Ivan led a retired life, and died in&nbsp;1696 at the age of thirty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Want of space compels us to deal here only with the leading facts of the reign of Peter the Great (1689-1725) ;&nbsp;for more minute details the reader must consult the special&nbsp;article (vol. xviii. p. 698). The great object of the new&nbsp;czar was to give Russia ports in some other direction than&nbsp;the White Sea, constantly blocked with ice. He had&nbsp;already trained an army which was officered by foreigners&nbsp;in his pay. The Turks were the first objects of his attack.&nbsp;At first he was unsuccessful in his attempt to get possession&nbsp;of Azoff at the mouth of the Don,—partly on account of the&nbsp;treason of the Dutch engineer Jansen, who, in consequence&nbsp;of some slight put upon him, went over to the enemy. In&nbsp;1696, however, he took the fort and soon afterwards made&nbsp;his triumphant entry into Moscow. In the following year&nbsp;Peter, accompanied by Lefort and Generals Golovin and&nbsp;Vosnîtzin, set out on his travels. For some time he worked&nbsp;at the docks of Saardam in Holland, and then he went&nbsp;to England, where he remained three months. The story&nbsp;of his stay at Deptford is too well known to need description here. He left England, taking with him a great&nbsp;number of ingenious men, who were appointed to teach the&nbsp;arts to the barbarous Russians. He was getting ready to go&nbsp;to Venice when he heard of the great revolt of the streltzî.&nbsp;Before his arrival their insurrection had been quelled by&nbsp;Gordon and others, and many of them lay in prison awaiting the sentences to be given by Peter. When he reached&nbsp;Moscow, a series of terrible executions took place, which&nbsp;have been described with only too much accuracy by some&nbsp;eyewitnesses, the chief being Korb, the secretary of the&nbsp;German embassy. In 1706 broke out the revolt of the&nbsp;Cossacks of the Don, and in 1709 that of Mazeppa, the&nbsp;hetman of the Little-Russian Cossacks, who eagerly joined&nbsp;Charles XII. in his struggle with Peter. As early as 1700&nbsp;the Russian czar had carried on war with this last of the&nbsp;vikings, as he had been called. In that year Charles&nbsp;defeated Peter at the battle of Narva, but the latter,&nbsp;although humbled, was not disheartened. He gathered all&nbsp;his strength for another encounter. In the following year&nbsp;Sheremetreff defeated the Swedish general Schlippenbach in&nbsp;Livonia, and again in 1702. The great object of Peter&nbsp;was to gain possession of the Neva ; this he attained, but&nbsp;the Russian arms were disgraced by many cruelties and&nbsp;robberies in the unfortunate Baltic provinces, which had&nbsp;already suffered so much in the wars of Ivan the Terrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Charles XII. now abandoned his attacks on the Polish king and invaded Russia. “ I will treat with the czar at&nbsp;Moscow,” he said. Peter replied, “My brother Charles&nbsp;wishes to play the part of Alexander, but he will not find&nbsp;me Darius.” At Lesna the Swedish general Löwenhaupt&nbsp;fought a desperate battle with the Russians, in which,&nbsp;although nominally victorious, his losses were terrible.&nbsp;On June 15 (n.s.) was fought the battle of Poltava, which&nbsp;resulted in the complete defeat of Charles. He had&nbsp;brought it on by his recklessness, and, it may be added,&nbsp;complete ignorance of his duties as a general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With the fall of Mazeppa and the coalition of the Little Russians in aid of Charles fell also the independence of&nbsp;the Cossacks and their </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sech</span><span class="font0"> or republic. They now became&nbsp;entirely dependent upon the Muscovite czar. The&nbsp;hetmanship, which had long been a mere empty title, lasted&nbsp;till the year 1789. In 1712 Peter married Martha&nbsp;Skavronska, a Livonian or Lithuanian peasant who had&nbsp;been taken prisoner at the siege of Marienburg in 1702.&nbsp;But little is known of her previous history ; she received&nbsp;the name of Catherine on being baptized as a member of&nbsp;the Greek Church. Peter had previously divorced his&nbsp;wife Eudokia, who was distasteful to him on account of&nbsp;her sympathies with the conservative party in Russia. He&nbsp;now set about his great plan of civilizing the country on&nbsp;the model of the nations of the West. In this he was&nbsp;assisted by many foreigners in his pay. He abolished the&nbsp;patriarchate, probably from dislike of its great power,&nbsp;based nobility entirely upon service either civil or military,&nbsp;and divided the merchants into guilds, but left serfdom still&nbsp;existing in Russia, or perhaps we may say with truth even&nbsp;augmented it, by doing away with the privileges which the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">odnodvortzi</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">polovniki</span><span class="font0"> had and confounding all in a&nbsp;common category of serfdom. His attempt to introduce&nbsp;primogeniture into Russia did not succeed. He put an&nbsp;end to the Oriental seclusion of women and the Oriental&nbsp;dress of men ; for the beard and long caftan were substituted the cleanly-shaved face and the dress in vogue&nbsp;in the West. He abolished also the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pravezhe</span><span class="font0"> or public&nbsp;flagellation of defaulting debtors. The army was completely remodelled on the European system. During&nbsp;the exile of Charles XIL at Bender Peter drove Stanislaus Leszczynski out of Poland, and Augustus II. reentered Warsaw. Peter conquered Esthonia and Livonia.&nbsp;He was not able to annex Courland, which was a&nbsp;feudatory of Poland, but he negotiated a marriage between&nbsp;the duke and his niece Anna, daughter of the late czar&nbsp;Ivan, who was afterwards empress. A foolish expedition&nbsp;undertaken against Turkey was not successful. Peter&nbsp;found himself but ill-supported by the inhabitants through&nbsp;whose territory he marched, and was compelled to sign the&nbsp;treaty of the Pruth in 1711, whereby he gave back Azoff,&nbsp;one of his most valuable conquests, to the Turks. The&nbsp;story of his having been rescued by the dexterity of&nbsp;Catherine seems to lack confirmation ; under any circumstances, he shortly afterwards acknowledged her as his&nbsp;wife. In Alay 17.13 Peter gained some fresh victories&nbsp;over the Swedes. In 1717 he made another European&nbsp;tour, visiting, among other places, Paris. On this occasion&nbsp;he was accompanied by his wife ; concerning both strange&nbsp;stories were told, but perhaps we must be cautious how we&nbsp;receive too credulously, as Carlyle has done, the malicious&nbsp;gossip of the margravine of Baireuth. In 1721, by the&nbsp;treaty of Nystad with Sweden, Peter was left master of&nbsp;Livonia, Esthonia, Ingria, and part of Finland. He had&nbsp;begun building St Petersburg, “the window by which&nbsp;Russia looks” at Europe, as early as 1703.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1722 we find Peter descending the Volga from Nijni to Astrakhan, and gaining some important points on&nbsp;that river. Previous to this had occurred the sad death</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
