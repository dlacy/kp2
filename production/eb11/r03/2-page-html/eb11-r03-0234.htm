<p><span class="font1">the other hand, for the last hundred years .and more, there have been some who have seen in romance almost the highest&nbsp;and certainly the most charming form of fictitious creation,&nbsp;the link between poetry and religion, the literary embodiment&nbsp;of men’s dreams and desires, the appointed nepenthe of more&nbsp;sophisticated ages as it was the appointed pastime of the less&nbsp;sophisticated. Between these opposites there is of course room&nbsp;for many middle positions, but few of these will be occupied&nbsp;safely and inexpugnably by those who do not take heed of&nbsp;the following conclusions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Romance, beyond all question, enmeshes and retains for us a vast amount of story-material to which we find little corresponding in ancient literature. It lays the foundation of modern&nbsp;prose fiction in such a fashion that the mere working out and&nbsp;building up of certain features leads to, and in fact involves,&nbsp;the whole structure of the modem novel </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.vf.</span><span class="font1"> It antiquates&nbsp;(by a sort of gradual “ taking for granted ”) the classical assumption that love is an inferior motive, and that women, though&nbsp;they “ may be good sometimes ” are scarcely fit for the position&nbsp;of principal personages. It helps to institute and ensure a new&nbsp;unity—the unity of interest. It admits of the most extensive&nbsp;variety. It gives a scope to the imagination which exceeds&nbsp;that of any known older literary form. At its best it embodies&nbsp;the new or Christian morality, if not in a Pharisaic yet in a&nbsp;Christian fashion, and it establishes a concordat between&nbsp;religion and art in more ways than this. Incapable of exacter&nbsp;definition, inclining (a danger doubtless as well as an advantage)&nbsp;towards the vague, it is nevertheless comprehensible for all its&nbsp;vagueness, and, informal as it is, possesses its own form of&nbsp;beauty—and that a precious one. These characteristics were,&nbsp;if perceived at all by its enemies in the period above referred&nbsp;to, taken at their worst; they were perceived by its champions&nbsp;at the turn of the tide and perhaps exaggerated. From both&nbsp;attitudes emerged that distinction between the “ classic ” and&nbsp;the “ romantic ” which was referred to at the beginning of this&nbsp;article as requiring notice before we conclude. The crudest,&nbsp;but it must be remembered the most intentionally crude (for&nbsp;Goethe knew the Iimitationsof his saying), is that “Classicism&nbsp;is health; Romanticism is disease.” In a less question-begging&nbsp;proposition of single terms, classicism might be said to be&nbsp;method and romanticism energy. But in fact sharp distinctions&nbsp;of the kind do much more harm than good. It is true that the&nbsp;one tends to order, lucidity, proportion; the other to freedom,&nbsp;to fancy, to caprice. But the attempt to rcimpose these&nbsp;qualities as absolutely distinguishing marks and labels on&nbsp;particular works is almost certain to lead to mistake and disaster, and there is more than mere irony in the person who&nbsp;defines romance as “ Something which was written between&nbsp;an unknown period of the Dark Ages and the Renaissance, and&nbsp;which has been imitated since the later part of the 18th century.”&nbsp;What that something really is is not well to be known except&nbsp;by reading more or less considerable sections of it—by exploring&nbsp;it like one of its own forbidden countries. But something of&nbsp;a sketch-map of that country has been attempted here.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Authorities.</span><span class="font1">—The first modern composition of importance on romance (putting aside the dealings of Italian critics in the&nbsp;16th century with the question of romantic </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">v.</span><span class="font1"> classical unity) is&nbsp;the very remarkable dialogue </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De la Jecture des vieux romans</span><span class="font1"> written&nbsp;by Chapelain in mid-17th century (ed. Feillet, Paris, 1870),&nbsp;which is a surprising and thoroughgoing defence of its subjects.&nbsp;But for long afterwards there was little save unintelligent and&nbsp;mostly quite ignorant depreciation. The sequence of really&nbsp;important serious works almost begins with Hurd’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Letters on&nbsp;Chivalry and Romance</span><span class="font1"> (1762). In succession to this may be consulted on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">general</span><span class="font1"> subject (which alone can be here regarded)&nbsp;the dissertations of Percy, Warton and Ritson; Sir Walter Scott,&nbsp;“ Essay on Romance ” in the supplement to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopaedia&nbsp;Britannica</span><span class="font1"> (1816-24); Dunlop, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Htstory of Fiction</span><span class="font1"> (1816, to be&nbsp;usefully supplemented and completed by its latest edition, 1888,&nbsp;with very large additions by H.

<p><span class="font1">ROMANCE LANGUAGES, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">name </span><span class="font1">generally adopted for the modem languages descended from the old Roman or Latin&nbsp;tongue, acted upon by inner decay or growth, by dialectic&nbsp;variety, and by outward influence, more or less marked, of all&nbsp;the foreign nations with &quot;which it came into contact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the middle ages the old Roman Empire or the Latinspeaking world was called Romania, its inhabitants Romani (adj. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Romanicus),</span><span class="font1"> and its speech Rom^ncium, Vulgar Romancio,&nbsp;Italian Romanzo, from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Romanice loqui—to</span><span class="font1"> speak Romance;&nbsp;in Old French nominative </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rornanz,</span><span class="font1"> objective </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">roman(t),</span><span class="font1"> Modern&nbsp;French </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">roman,</span><span class="font1"> “ a novel.” originally a composition in the&nbsp;vulgar tongue. In English some modems use Romanic (like&nbsp;Germanic, Teutonic) instead of Romance; some say Neo-Latin,&nbsp;which is frequently used by Romance-speaking scholars. By&nbsp;successive changes Latin, a synthetical language, rich in inflexions, was transformed into several cognate analytical tongues&nbsp;of few inflexions, most of the old forms being replaced by&nbsp;separate form-words. As the literary language of the ancient&nbsp;Roman civilization died out, seemingly extinguished by the&nbsp;barbarism of the middle, ages, all the forms of the old classical&nbsp;language being confounded in the most hopeless chaos, suddenly&nbsp;new, vigorous and beautiful tongues sprang forth, ruled by&nbsp;the most regular laws, related to*, yet different from, Latin.&nbsp;How was this wonderful change brought about? How can&nbsp;chaos produce regularity? The explanation of this mystery&nbsp;has been given by Diez,* the gTeat founder of Romance philology.&nbsp;The Romance languages did not spring from literary classical&nbsp;Latin, but from popular Latin, which, like every living speech,&nbsp;had its own laws, not subject to the changing literary fashions,&nbsp;but only to the slow process of phonetic change and dialectic&nbsp;variety. It is interesting to observe that much that is handed&nbsp;down to us in the oldest Latin literature (notably in the vocabulary) reappears in the most recent phase of Latin—the&nbsp;Romance languages. Thus, a verb </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nivëre,</span><span class="font1"> “ to snow,” is known&nbsp;to Pacuvius, but does not again appear until the time of&nbsp;Venantius Fortunatus, and then with a change of conjugation&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">—nivëre,</span><span class="font1"> while it has now a new term of life in French and&nbsp;Rhaeto-Romanic dialects. It is obvious that there was no&nbsp;break of continuity^ in the vulgar language, for if in the later&nbsp;imperial ages a verb had been formed from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nix, nivis,</span><span class="font1"> it must&nbsp;have been </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nivare,</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">niviare</span><span class="font1"> (Fr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">neiger).</span><span class="font1"> Here especially the&nbsp;words of Horace come true:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ Multa renascentur, quae jam cecidere, cadentque Quae nunc sunt in sonore vocabula, si volet usus,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Quem penes arbitrium est et jus et norma loquendi.”</span></p>
