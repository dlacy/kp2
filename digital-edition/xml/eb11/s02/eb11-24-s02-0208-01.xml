The word comes through the Latin from the Greek <hi rend="italic">σαρκάζουν,</hi> literally to tear flesh (σαρξ) like a dog; hence, figuratively, to bite the lips in rage, to speak bitterly (cf. Stobaeus, <hi rend="italic">Eclog.</hi> ii. 222). The etymology of this may be paralleled by the English “ sneer,” from Dan. <hi rend="italic">snarre,</hi> to grin like a dog, cognate with “ snarl,” to make a rattling <hi rend="italic">r</hi> sound in the throat, Ger. <hi rend="italic">schnarren</hi>, and possibly also by “ sardonic.” This latter word appears in Greek in the form <hi rend="italic">σαρδαvcοs,</hi> always in the sense of bitter or scornful laughter, in such phrases as <hi rend="italic">σαράανιον yeλδv, yeλωs σαpδαvιοs</hi> and the like. It is probably connected with <hi rend="italic">σαipeιv,</hi> to draw back, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> the lips, like a dog, but was usually explained (by the early scholiasts and commentators) as referring to a Sardinian plant <hi rend="italic">(Ranunculus Sardous),</hi> whose bitter taste screwed up the mouth. Thus, later Greek writers wrote <hi rend="italic">∑αpδδvιοv,</hi> and it was adopted into Latin; cf. Servius on Virg. <hi rend="italic">Ecl.</hi> vii. 41 “ immo ego Sardois videar tibi amarior herbis.”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
