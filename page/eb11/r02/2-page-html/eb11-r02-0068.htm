For the early history, see Blackstone’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Commentaries,</span><span class="font2"> iii. 145 seq. Only goods and cattle can be the subjects&nbsp;of an action for replevin. Although the action can be brought&nbsp;for the wrongful taking of goods generally, as long as the initial&nbsp;taking was wrongful and it was from the possession of the&nbsp;owner; it is practically confined to goods taken by an illegal&nbsp;as opposed to an excessive distress (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Distress</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rent,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">§ Legal).</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Prince Anikita Ivanovich Repnin</span><span class="font2"> (1668-1726), Russian general, and one of the collaborators of Peter the Great, with&nbsp;whom he grew up. On the occasion of the Sophian insurrection&nbsp;of 1689, he carefully guarded Peter in the Troitsa monastery,&nbsp;and subsequently took part in the Azov expedition, during&nbsp;which he was raised to the grade of general. He took part in&nbsp;all the principal engagements of the Great Northern War.&nbsp;Defeated by Charles XII. at Holowczyn, he was degraded to the&nbsp;ranks, but was pardoned as a reward for his valour at Lyesna&nbsp;and recovered aU his lost dignities. At Poltava he commanded&nbsp;the centre. From the Ukraine he was transferred to the Baltic&nbsp;Provinces and was made the first governor-general of Riga after&nbsp;its capture in 1710. In 1724 he succeeded the temporarily&nbsp;disgraced favourite, Menshikov, as war minister. Catherine I.&nbsp;created him a field-marshal.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">His grandson, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Prince Nikolai Vasilev<sup>t</sup>Ich Repnin</span><span class="font2"> (1734-1801), Russian statesman and general, served under his father, Prince Vasily Anikitovich, during the Rhenish campaign of 1748*&nbsp;and subsequently resided for some time abroad, where he&nbsp;acquired “ a thoroughly sound German education.” He also&nbsp;participated in the Seven Years’ War in a subordinate capacity.&nbsp;Peter III. sent him as ambassador in 1763 to Berlin. The same&nbsp;year Catherine transferred him to Warsaw as minister plenipotentiary, with especial instructions to form a Russian party&nbsp;in Poland from among the dissidents, who were to receive equal&nbsp;rights with the Catholics. Repnin convinced himself that the&nbsp;dissidents were too poor and insignificant to be of any real&nbsp;support to Russia, and that the whole agitation in their favour&nbsp;was factitious. At last, indeed, the dissidents themselves even&nbsp;petitioned the empress to leave them alone. It is clear from his&nbsp;correspondence that Repnin, a singularly proud and high-spirited man, much disliked the very dirty work he was called&nbsp;upon to do. -Nevertheless he faithfully obeyed his instructions,&nbsp;and, by means more or less violent or discreditable, forced the&nbsp;diet of 17 68 to concede everything. The immediate result was the&nbsp;Confederation of Bar, which practically destroyed the ambassador’s handiwork. Repnin resigned his post for the more&nbsp;congenial occupation of fighting the Turks. At the head of an&nbsp;independent command in Moldavia and Walachia, he prevented&nbsp;a large Turkish army from crossing the Pruth (1770); distinguished himself at the actions of Larga and Kagula; and&nbsp;captured Izmail and Kilia. In 1771 he received the supreme&nbsp;command in Walachia and routed the Turks at Bucharest. A&nbsp;quarrel with the commander-in-chief, Rumyantsev, then induced&nbsp;him to send in his resignation, but in 1774 he participated in the&nbsp;capture of Silistria and in the negotiations which led to the&nbsp;peace of Kuchuk-Kainarji. In 1775-76 he was ambassador at&nbsp;the Porte. On the outbreak of the war of the Bavarian Succession he led 30,000 men to Breslau, and at the subsequent&nbsp;congress of Teschen, where he was Russian plenipotentiary,&nbsp;compelled Austria to make peace with Prussia. During the&nbsp;second Turkish war (1787-92) Repnin was, after Suvarov,&nbsp;the most successful of the Russian commanders. He defeated&nbsp;the Turks at Salcha, captured the whole camp of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">seraskier,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Hassan Pasha, shut him up in Izmail, and was preparing to reduce</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the place when he was forbidden to do so by Potemkin (1789L On the retirement of Potemkin </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font2"> in 1791, Repnin succeeded&nbsp;him as commander-in-chief, and immediately routed the grand&nbsp;vizier at Machin, a victory which compelled the Turks to accept&nbsp;the truce of Galatz (31st of July 1791). In 1794 he was made&nbsp;governor-general of the newly acquired Lithuaman provinces.&nbsp;The emperor Paul raised him to the rank of field-marshal (1796),&nbsp;and, in 1798, sent him on a diplomatic mission to Berlin and&nbsp;Vienna in order to detach Prussia from France and unite both&nbsp;Austria and Prussia against the Jacobins. On his return unsuccessful, he was dismissed the service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">REPORTING, the art or business of reproducing in readable form, mainly for newspapers, but also for such publications as&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parliamentary</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Law Reports,</span><span class="font2"> the words of speeches, or&nbsp;describing in narrative form the events, in contemporary history,&nbsp;by means of the notes made by persons known generally as&nbsp;reporters. The special business of reporting is a comparatively&nbsp;modern one, since it must not be confounded with the general&nbsp;practice of quoting, or of mere narrative, which is as old as&nbsp;writing. There was no truly systematic reporting until the&nbsp;beginning of the 19th century, though there was parliamentary&nbsp;reporting of a kind almost from the time when parliaments&nbsp;began, just as law reporting (which goes back to 1292) began in&nbsp;the form of notes taken by lawyers of discussions in court. The&nbsp;first attempts at parliamentary reporting, in the sense of seeking&nbsp;to make known to the public what was done and said in parliament, began in a pamphlet published monthly in Queen Anne’s&nbsp;time called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Political State.</span><span class="font2"> Its reports were mere indications&nbsp;of speeches. Later, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">GentlemaPs Magazine</span><span class="font2"> began to publish&nbsp;reports of parliamentary debates. Access to the Houses of&nbsp;Parliament was obtained by Edward Cave </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.vf,</span><span class="font2"> the publisher&nbsp;of this magazine, and some of his friends, and they took&nbsp;surreptitiously what notes they could. These were subsequently&nbsp;transcribed and brought into shape for publication by another&nbsp;hand. Dr Johnson for some years wrote the speeches, and he&nbsp;took care, as he admitted, not to let the “ Whig dogs ” get the&nbsp;best of it; the days of verbatim reporting were not yet come,&nbsp;and it was considered legitimate to make people say in print&nbsp;what substantially was supposed to represent their opinions. ,&nbsp;There was a strict parliamentary prohibition of all public&nbsp;reporting; but the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gentleman<sup>i</sup>S Magazine</span><span class="font2"> appears to have&nbsp;continued its reports for some time without attracting the&nbsp;attention or rousing the jealousy of the House of Commons.&nbsp;The publisher, encouraged by immunity from prosecution by&nbsp;parliament, grew bolder, and began in his reports to give the&nbsp;names of the speakers. Then he was called to account. A&nbsp;standing order was passed in 1728, which declared “ that it is&nbsp;an indignity to, and a breach of, the privilege of this House&nbsp;for any person <sub>x</sub>to presume to give, in written or printed newspapers, any account or minute of the debates or other proceedings; that upon discovery of the authors, printers or publishers&nbsp;of any such newspaper this House will proceed against the&nbsp;offenders with the utmost severity.” Under this and other&nbsp;standing orders, Cave’s reports were challenged, with the result&nbsp;that they appeared without the proper names of the speakers,&nbsp;and under the guise of “ Debates in the Senate of Lilliput</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
