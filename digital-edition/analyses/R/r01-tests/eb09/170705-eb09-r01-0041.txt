Of the total receipts for passengers and goods, goods brought 56∙8 per cent, and passengers 43∙2. In 1857 the proportions were nearly the same,—56 and 44 per cent, respectively. For the three kingdoms separately the percentages for 1883 were (Table Xλr II. ) :—

These quantities for 1883 are proportionally for the three kingdoms as 4, 2¼, 1. For the year 1857 the corresponding amounts were as 3, 2, 1, so that the growth of traffic in the interval has been greater in England than in Scotland, and greater in Scotland than in Ireland.
Table XIX. (below) contains a summary of the expenditure of the railways of the United Kingdom for the year 1883, with the rate of expenditure of different kinds per mile open and per train mile run, and, in addition, the proportional expenditure of the different kinds in parts of the total working expenditure. The heads of expenditure are classified in this table in order to separate direct or really working expenditure from what may be called contingent or incidental expenditure not essential to the working of a railway, as rates, duty, compensation, &c. The direct or essential working expenditure is thus upwards of 32 millions sterling, or 86 per cent, of the whole expenditure. The amount and proportion of the net receipts are shown by deducting the total working expenditure from the total receipts, as under :—
Per train mile.
Total receipts................£71,062,270,    or    5s.    3'4d.    or    100    per cent

Net receipts ..........£33,692,708    „    2s.    6d.    „    47    4    „
The net receipts available for payment of dividend are equal to 4- 29 per cent, on the paid-up capital, and they were disposed for 1883 in the following fashion :—
On ordinary capital ............£13,725,933, equivalent to 4∙68 per cent.
On guaranteed and preferential
capital ...................... 12,601,797    „    „    4∙26    „
On bonus and debenture stock    .. 8,254,643    ,,    ,,    4- 21    „
Total payments ..........£34,582,373    „    ,,    4- 41    „
Net available receipts    ....£33,692,708    „    ,,    4∙29    „
The total distribution, it appears, exceeded the available net receipts for the year by nearly £1,000,000. In explanation of the
