<p><label>RUBUS</label>
the Bramble, or <hi rend="italic">Raſpberry bufl&gt; :</hi> A genus of the polygamia order, belonging to the icoſan-dria claſs of plants ; and in the natural order ranking under the 35th order, <hi rend="italic">Senticoſe.</hi> The calyx is quin-quefid, the petals five ; the berry confiſting of mono-ſpermous acini or pulpy grains. The principal ſpecies is the common raſpberry, which, with its varieties, demands culture in every garden for their fruit ; particularly the common red kind, white fort, and twice-bearing raſpberry ; all of which are great bearers : but for the general plantations, we chooſe principally the common red and the white kind, as being generally the greateſt bearers oſ all ; planting alſo a ſhare of the ^vice-bearing fort, both as a curioſity and for the ſake of its autumnal crops of fruit, which in favourable ſeaſons ripen in tolerable perfection ; obſerving to allow all the forts ſome open expoſure in the kitchen garden, though they will proſper in almoſt any ſituation.</p><p>The other ſpecies are confidered as plants of variety, for hardy plantations in the ſhrubbery. Some of them are alſo very ornamental flowering plants ; particularly the Virginian flowering raſpberry, and the double-bloſſomed bramble, which have great merit as furniture for ornamental compartments ; and the white-berried bramble, which is a great curioſity. All the other ſpecies and varieties ſerve to diverfify large collections.</p>
