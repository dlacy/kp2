<p><span class="font1">ROLLER, a very beautiful bird, so called from its way of occasionally rolling or turning over in its flight,@@<sup>1</sup> somewhat&nbsp;after the fashion of a tumbler-pigeon. It is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Coracias&nbsp;garrulus</span><span class="font1"> of ornithology, and is widely though not very numerously spread over Europe and Western Asia in summer, breeding&nbsp;so far to the northward as the middle of Sweden, but retiring&nbsp;to winter in Africa. It occurs almost every year'in some part&nbsp;or other of the British Islands, from Cornwall to the Shetlands,&nbsp;while it has visited Ireland several times, and is even recorded&nbsp;from St Kilda. But it is only as a wanderer that it comes,&nbsp;since there is no evidence of its having ever attempted to&nbsp;breed in· Great Britain; and indeed its conspicuous appearance—for it is nearly as big as a daw and very brightly coloured&nbsp;—would forbid its being ever allowed to escape a gun. Except&nbsp;the back, scapulars and tertials, which are bright reddish-brown, the plumage of both sexes is almost entirely blue—&nbsp;of various shades, from pale turquoise to dark ultramarine—&nbsp;tinted in parts with green. The bird seems to be purely insectivorous. The genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Coracias,</span><span class="font1"> for a long while placed by&nbsp;systematists among the crows, has really no affinity whatever&nbsp;to them, and is now properly considered to belong to the heterogeneous group of birds now associated as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Coraciiformes,</span><span class="font1"> in&nbsp;which it forms the type of the family Coraciidae; and its&nbsp;alliance to the bee-eaters (Meropidae) and king-fishers (Alce-dinidae) (ç.v.) is very evident. Some eight other species of&nbsp;the genus have been recognized, one of which, C. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ieucocephalus&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">C. abyssinicus,</span><span class="font1"> is said to have occurred in Scotland. India&nbsp;has two species, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">C. indicus</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">C. affinis,</span><span class="font1"> of which thousands&nbsp;upon thousands used to be annually destroyed to supply the&nbsp;demand for gaudy feathers to bedizen ladies’ dresses. One&nbsp;species, C. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">temmincki,</span><span class="font1"> seems to be peculiar to Celebes and the&nbsp;neighbouring islands, but otherwise the rest are natives of&nbsp;the Ethiopian or Indian regions. Allied to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Coracias</span><span class="font1"> is the&nbsp;genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Eurystomus</span><span class="font1"> with some half-dozen species, of similar&nbsp;distribution, but one of them, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">E. pacificus,</span><span class="font1"> has a wider range,&nbsp;for it inhabits Australia and reaches Tasmania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Madagascar has four or five very remarkable forms which have often been considered to belong to the family Coraciidae; and,&nbsp;according to A. MiIne-Edwards<sub>f</sub> no doubt should exist on that&nbsp;point. Yet if any may be entertained it is in regard to one of them,</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@l</sup>Gesner in 1555 said that the bird was thus called, and for this reason, near Strassburg, but the name seems not to be generally&nbsp;used in Germany, where the bird is commonly called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rake,</span><span class="font1"> apparently&nbsp;from its harsh note. The French have kept the name </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rollier.</span><span class="font1"> It&nbsp;is a curious fact that the roller, notwithstanding, its occurrence in&nbsp;the Levant, cannot be identified with any species mentioned by&nbsp;Aristotle.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Leptosornus discolor,</span><span class="font1"> which, on account of its Zygodactylous feet, some authorities place amonç the Cuculidac, while others have&nbsp;considered it the type of a distinct family Lcptosomatidae. The&nbsp;genera </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Brachypteracias</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Atelornis</span><span class="font1"> present fewer structural&nbsp;differences from the rollers, and perhaps may be rightly placed&nbsp;with them; but the species of the latter have long tarsi, and are&nbsp;believed to be of terrestrial habit, which rollers generally certainly&nbsp;are not. These very curious and in some respects very interesting&nbsp;forms, which are peculiar to Madagascar, arc admirably described&nbsp;and illustrated by a scries of twenty plates in the great w’ork of A.&nbsp;Grandidier and A. Milne-Edwards on that island </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Oiseaux,</span><span class="font1"> pp. 223-250), while the whole family Coraciidae is the subject of a monograph Ity H. E. Dresser, as a companion volume to his monograph&nbsp;on the Meropidae.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A. N.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROLLER. For agricultural purposes the roller formerly consisted of a solid cylinder of timber or stone attached to a&nbsp;frame and shafts, but to facilitate turning two or more iron&nbsp;cylinders revolving on an axle are now generally used. The&nbsp;simplest form has a smooth surface. The diameter of the&nbsp;drum should be as great as possible—30 in. being a good size—&nbsp;because the larger this is the more easily it is pulled (within&nbsp;certain limits), while rollers of small diameter are heavier of&nbsp;draught and do their work less efficiently. The implement&nbsp;is used in spring and summer as an aid in pulverizing and&nbsp;cleaning the soil, by bruising clods and lumps of tangled roots&nbsp;and earth which the cultivator or other implement has brought&nbsp;Jo the surface; in smoothing the surface for the reception of&nbsp;small seeds or the better operation of the mower or reaper;&nbsp;in consolidating soil that is too loose in texture and pressing&nbsp;it down about the roots of young plants. In the case of young&nbsp;plants the roots are close to the surface, which must therefore&nbsp;be kept moist. This end is attained by the compression by the&nbsp;roller of the top-soil of which the capillarity, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> the power of&nbsp;drawing water from the sub-soil is thereby increased. On the&nbsp;other hand, when it is desired to conserve the soil-moisture, the&nbsp;roller may be followed by the harrow, which, by pulverizing&nbsp;the surface-soil, breaks the capillarity. Of the variations on&nbsp;the common smooth roller, the clod-crusher and the Cambridge&nbsp;roller are the most important. The clod-crusher combines&nbsp;weight with breaking power. The best-known form was&nbsp;patented about 1841 by Crosskill, and consists of a number of&nbsp;disks with serrated edges threaded loosely on an axle round&nbsp;which they revolve. The Cambridge roller carries on its axle&nbsp;a number of closely packed wheels, the rims of which narrow&nbsp;down to a wedge shape. The tubular roller, instead of drums,&nbsp;has tubes arranged longitudinally, producing a corrugated&nbsp;surface which is reproduced in the condition of the soil after&nbsp;it has been rolled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROLLER-SKATING, a pastime which, by the use of small wheels instead of a blade on the skate, has provided some of the&nbsp;pleasures of skating on ice without having ice as the surface&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Skating).</span><span class="font1"> Wheeled skates were used on the roads of Holland as far back as the 18th century, but it was the invention of&nbsp;the four-wheeled skate, working on rubber springs, by J. L. Plimpton of New York, in 1863, that made the amusement popular.&nbsp;Still greater advance was made by the Raymond skate with&nbsp;ball and cone bearings. The wheels or rollers were first of&nbsp;turned boxwood, but the wearing of the edges was a fault&nbsp;which has been surmounted by making them of a hard composition or of steel. The floor of the rink on which the skating&nbsp;takes place is either of asphalt or of wood. The latter is that&nbsp;always used in newly made rinks. The best floors arc of long&nbsp;narrow strips of maple. Figure-skating on roller-skates is in&nbsp;some respects easier to learn than on ice-skates, the four points&nbsp;of contact given by the wheels rendering easier -the holding of&nbsp;an edge; but some figures, such as loops, are more difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROLLIN, CHARLES (1661-1741), French historian and educationist, was born at Paris on the 30th of January i66r.&nbsp;He was the son of a cutler, and at the age of twenty-two was&nbsp;made a master in the Collège du Plessis. In 1694 he was&nbsp;rector of the university of Paris, rendering great service among&nbsp;other things by reviving the study of Greek. He held that&nbsp;post for tw’o years instead of one, and in 1699 was appointed&nbsp;principal of the College de Beauvais. Rollin held Jansenist</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
