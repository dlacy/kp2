The first method will require the course to be lengthened in the proportion of 24<hi rend="sup">2</hi> to 38*94<hi rend="sup">2</hi>, or nearly of 38 to 100. The expense of this would be enormous. The second method will require the hydraulic mean depth to be increased nearly in the same proportion (because the velocities are nearly as 5∕f∕∖</p><p>—=J. This will evidently be much less costly and, even √*∕</p><p>to procure convenient room for the navigation, must be preferred.</p><p>We must now observe, that the great velocity of which we are afraid obtains only during the winter floods. If therefore we reduce this to 24 inches, it must happen that the autumnal freshes, loaded with sand and mud, will certainly deposit a part of it, and choke up our channel below the floodgates. We must therefore select a mean velocity somewhat exceeding the regimen, that it may carry off these depositions. We shall take 27 inches, which will produce this effect on the loose mud without endangering our channel in any remarkable degree.</p><p>Therefore we have, by the theorem for uniform motion,</p><p>V = 27 =    <hi rend="sup">7</hi>    —0*3<hi rend="italic">L/d —</hi>  0*l). Calcu-</p><p>√s-L√s+1*6    ∖    <hi rend="italic">J</hi></p><p>lating the divisor of this formula, we find it = 55-884. Hence 27</p><p>√cZ—0∙1= -297-= 5∙3483, and therefore <hi rend="italic">d</hi></p><p>-t⅛057--θ<hi rend="sup">,</hi>3</p><p>55*884</p><p>= 30-⅛. Having thus determined the hydraulic mean depth, we find the area S of the section by dividing the discharge 1514169 by the velocity 27. This gives us 56080*368. Then we get the breadth B by the formula formerly given B =    —2S +    1802*296 inches,</p><p>or 150*19 feet, and the depth <hi rend="italic">h</hi>  = 31*115 inches.</p><p>With these dimensions of the section, w-e are certain that the channel will be permanent ; and the cills of the floodgate being all fixed agreeably to the primitive slope, we need not fear that it will be changed in the intervals by the action of the current. The gates being all open during the freshes, the bottom will be cleared of the whole deposited mud.</p><p>We must now station the floodgates along the new channel, at such distances that w-e may have the depth of water which is proper for the lighters that are to be employed in the navigation. Suppose this to be four feet. We must first of all learn how high the w-ater will be kept in this new channel during the summer droughts. There remained in the primitive channel only two feet, and the section in this case had twenty feet eight inches mean width ; and the discharge corresponding to this section and slope <hi rend="sub">y</hi>⅛<hi rend="sub">0</hi>- is, by the theorem of uniform motion, 130849 cubic inches per second. To find the depth of water in the new channel corresponding to this discharge and the same slope, we must take the method of approximation formerly exemplified, remembering that the discharge D is 130849, and the breadth B is 1760*8 at the bottom (the slant sides being four thirds). These data will produce a depth of water = 6½ inches. To obtain four feet therefore behind any of the floodgates, we must have a swell of 41 j inches produced by the gate below.</p><p>We must now determine the width of passage which must be given at the gates. This will regulate the thickness of the sheet of water which flows over them when shut; and this, with the height of the gate, fixes the swell at the gate. The extent of this swell, and the elevation of every point of its curved surface above the new surface of the river, require a combination of the height of swell at the floodgate, with the primitive slope and the new velocity.</p><p>These bemg computed, the stations of the gates may h assigned, which will secure four feet of water behind eac in summer. We need not give these computations, haι ing already exemplified them all with relation to anothι river.</p><p>This examp.e not only illustrates the method of procee&lt; ing, so as to be insured of success, but also gives us a pr&lt; cise instance of what must be done in a case which cannι but frequently occur. We see what a prodigious excav; tion is necessary in order to obtain permanency. We hav been obliged to enlarge the primitive bed to about thru its former size, so that the excavation is at least two thin of what the other method required. The expense, hov ever, will still be vastly inferior to the other, both from tl nature of the work and the quantity of ground occupie At all events, the expense is enormous, and what con never be repaid by the navigation, except in a very riι and populous country.</p><p>There is another circumstance to be attended to. Tl navigation of this river by sluices must be very desultor unless they are extremely numerous, and of small height The natural surface of the swell being concave upwards, tl additions made by its different parts to the primitive heigl of the river decrease rapidly as they approach to the pla&lt; A (fig. 23), where the swell terminates ; and three gate each of which raises the water one foot when placed at tl proper distance from each other, will raise the water muι more than two gates at twice this distance, each raising tl water two feet. Moreover, when the elevation produc&lt; by a floodgate is considerable, exceeding a very few inche the fall and current produced by the opening of the gate such that no boat can possibly pass up the river, and runs imminent risk of being overset and sunk in the a tempt to go down the stream. This renders the navigati( desultory. A number of lighters collect themselves at tl gates, and wait their opening. They pass through as so&lt; as the current becomes moderate. This would not, pe haps, be very hurtful in a regulated navigation, if they cou then proceed on their voyage. But the boats bound up tl river must stay on the upper side of the gate which th&lt; have just now passed, because the channel is now too shi low for them to proceed. Those bound down the river <hi rend="italic">a </hi>only go to the next gate, unless it has been opened at time nicely adjusted to the opening of the one above The passage downwards <hi rend="italic">may,</hi>  in many cases, be continue by very intelligent and attentive lockmen ; but the passai up <hi rend="italic">must</hi>  be exceedingly tedious.

It did not therefore mer on its own account, the attention we have bestowed on But the discussion was absolutely necessary, in order show what must be done in order to obtain effect and pc manency, and thus to prevent us from engaging in a pr ject which, to a person not duly and confidently informe is so feasible and promising.
