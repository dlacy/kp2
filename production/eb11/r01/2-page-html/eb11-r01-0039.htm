<p><span class="font2">of the projecting spines is often differentiated into a bundle of fibres converging on to the spines some way up (distally); these,&nbsp;comparable to the myonemes of Infusoria (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q. υ</span><span class="font2">. ), &amp;c., and termed&nbsp;“ myophrisks ”, possibly serve to drag outwards the surface&nbsp;and so extend it, with concurrent dilatation of the alveoli, and&nbsp;lower the specific gravity of the animal. In this group also a&nbsp;thick temporary flagellum “ sarcoflagellum ” may be formed,&nbsp;apparently by the coalescence of a number of pseudopodia.&nbsp;The pigmented mass or “ phaeodium ” in the ectoplasm of&nbsp;Phaeodaria appears to be an excretory product, formed within&nbsp;the central capsule and passing immediately outwards; a similar&nbsp;uniform deposit of pigmented granules occurs in the Colloid&nbsp;species, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Thalassicolla nucleata.</span><span class="font2"> The wall of the central cap-sule is simple in the Spumellaria, but formed of two layers&nbsp;in the Nassellaria and Phaeodaria. In the Nassellaria the&nbsp;oscule is simply a perforated area, and a cone of differentiated&nbsp;fibres in the intracapsular cytoplasm has its base on it: it is&nbsp;termed the “porocone, ” and the fibres may possibly be muscular&nbsp;(myonemes). In Phaeodaria, the inner membrane at each oscule&nbsp;is prolonged through the outer into a tube (“proboscis”):&nbsp;the outer membrane of the principal oscule forms a large radially&nbsp;striated circular plate, the “ astropyle, ” or “ operculum. ”&nbsp;The innermost shell of some with concentric shells may lie&nbsp;within the central capsule, or even within the nucleus; this is&nbsp;due to the growth of these organs after the initial shell is formed,&nbsp;so that they pass out by lobes through the latticed openings&nbsp;of the embryonic shell, which lobes ultimately coalesce outside&nbsp;the embryonic chamber, and so come finally to invest it (fig.&nbsp;III. 17). In some, a symbiosis occurs with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zooxanlhella, </span><span class="font2">Brandt, a Flagellate of the group Chrysomadineae, which&nbsp;in the resting state inhabits the extracapsular cytoplasm&nbsp;growing and dividing freely therein, and only (under study)&nbsp;becoming free and flagellate on the death of the host (fig. III.&nbsp;4, 6-13). The Silicoflagellata or Dictyochidae, also possessing&nbsp;a vegetable colouring matter, but with a skeleton of impure&nbsp;silica (like that of Phaeodaria), may pass some of their lives in&nbsp;symbiosis with Radiolaria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Living Radiolaria were first observed and partially described by W. J. Tilesius in 1803-6 and 1814, by W. Baird in 1830,&nbsp;and by C. G. Ehrenberg in 1831, as luminous organisms in the&nbsp;sea; F. J. F. Meyen in 1834 recognized their animal character&nbsp;and the siliceous nature of their spicules. Ehrenberg a little later&nbsp;described a large number of Nassellarian skeletons under the</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2">name of Polycystina (1838), but without more than a very slight knowledge of a few living forms. T. H. Huxley in 1851&nbsp;made the first adequate study of the living animal, and was&nbsp;followed by Joh. Müller in the same decade. E. Haeckel began&nbsp;his publications in 1862, and in two enormous, abundantly&nbsp;illustrated, systematic works, besides minor publications, has&nbsp;dealt exhaustively with the cytology, classification, and distribution of the class. Next in value come the contributions&nbsp;of Richard Hertwig (largely developmental), besides those of&nbsp;L. Cienkowsky, Karl Brandt and A. Borgert, while to F.&nbsp;Dreyer and V. Hacker we owe valuable studies on the physical&nbsp;relations of the skeleton.</span></p>
