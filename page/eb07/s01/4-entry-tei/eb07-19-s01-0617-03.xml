 an island in the Eastern Seas, situated off the southern extremity of Celebes, about the sixth degree of south latitude. This island is about forty miles in length by eight in average breadth ; and there are many smaller isles around it, two of which only are inhabited, namely, Bonarutte and Calawe. It is mountainous and woody, yet better cultivated and peopled than most of the</p><p>eastern isles. The principal produce is millet, which is the chief subsistence of the natives, and cotton, which is raised in a coarse manner. From this raw material coarse blue and white stripped cloths are manufactured, for internal consumption and for exportation. The inhabitants, according to the estimate of Captain Forrest, amount to about 60,000. They have good houses ; and the richer classes, in travelling, are carried in bamboo chairs over the hills, while horses are used in the level country. The island was ceded by the Macassars, who had obtained possession of it, to the king of Ternate, from whom it was taken by the Dutch East India Company. The Dutch had a junior resident here as merchant, who dwelt in a pallisadoed fort.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
