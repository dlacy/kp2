(Sir Charles), an Engliſh poet and wit, the ſon of Sir John Sedley of Aylesford in Kent, was born about the year 1639. At the reſtoration he came to London to join the general jubilee; and commenced wit, courtier, poet, and gallant. He was ſo much admired, that he became a kind of oracle among the poets; which made king Charles tell him, that Nature had given him a patent to be Apollo’s viceroy. The productions of his pen were some plays, and ſeveral delicately tender amorous poems, in which the ſoftneſs of the verses was ſo exquiſite, as to be called by the duke of Buckingham <hi rend="italic">Sedley’s witchcraft.</hi> “There were no marks of genius or true poetry to be deſcried, (ſay the authors of the <hi rend="italic">Biographia Britannica);</hi> the art wholly conſiſted in raiſing looſe thoughts and lewd deſires, without giving any alarm; and ſo the poiſon worked gently and irreſiſtibly. Our author, we may be ſure, did not eſcape the infection of his own art, or rather was firſt tainted himſelf before he ſpread the infection to others.’’—A very ingenious writer of the preſent day, however, ſpeaks much more favourably of Sir Charles Sedley’s writings. “He ſtudied human nature; and was diſtinguiſhed for the art of making himſelf agreeable, particularly to the ladies; for the verſes of Lord Rocheſter, beginning with, <hi rend="italic">Sedley has that prevailing gentle art,</hi> &amp; c. ſo often quoted, allude not to his <hi rend="italic">writings,</hi> but to his <hi rend="italic">personal addreſs." [Langhorn's Effusions,</hi> &amp; c.]—But while he thus grew in reputation for wit and in favour with the king, he grew poor and debauched: his eſtate was impaired, and his morals were corrupted. One of his frolics, however, being followed by an indictment and a heavy fine, Sir Charles took a more ſerious turn, applied himſelf to buſineſs, and became a member of parliament, in which he was a frequent ſpeaker. We find him in the Houſe of Commons in the reign of James II. whoſe attempts upon the conſtitution he vigorouſly withſtood; and he was very active in bringing on the revolution. This was thought more extraordinary, as he had received favours from James. But that prince had taken a fancy to Sir Charles’s daughter (though it ſeems ſhe was not very handſome), and, in conſequence of his intrigues with</p><p>her, he created Miſs Sedley counteſs of Dorcheſter, This honour, ſo far from pleaſing, greatly ſhocked Sir Charles. However libertine he himſelf had been, yet he could not bear the thoughts of his daughter’s diſhonour; and with regard to her exaltation, he only considered it as rendering her more conſpicuouſly infamous. He therefore conceived a hatred for the king; and from this, as well as other motives, readily joined to diſpoſſeſs him of the throne. A witty ſaying of Sedley’s, on this occaſion, is recorded. “I hate ingratitude, (ſaid Sir Charles); and therefore, as the king has made my daughter a counteſs, ‘I will endeavour to make his daughter a queen;” meaning the princeſs Mary, married to the prince of Orange, who diſpoſſeſſed James of the throne at the revolution. He lived to the beginning of queen Anne’s reign; and his works were printed in 2 vols 8vo, 1719.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
