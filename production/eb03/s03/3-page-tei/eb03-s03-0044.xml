During the time of Mr Bruce’s reſidence here, however, there was one week of continual rain, and the Nile, after loud thunder and great darkneſs to the ſouth, increaſed violently ; the whole ſtream being covered with the wrecks or houſes and their furniture ; so that he ſuppoſed it had deſtroyed many villages to the ſouthward. About 12 miles to the north-west of Sennaar is a collection of villages named <hi rend="italic">Shaddly,</hi> from a great ſaint of that name, who conſtructed ſeveral granaries here. Theſe are no other than large pits dug in the ground, and well plaſtered in the inside with clay, then filled with grain when it is at its loweſt price, and afterwards covered up and plaſtered again at top : theſe pits they call <hi rend="italic">matamores.</hi> On any proſpect of dearth they are opened, and the corn sold to the people. About 24 miles north of Shaddly there is another ſet of granaries named <hi rend="italic">Wed-Abοud,</hi> ſtill greater than Shaddly; and upon theſe two the ſubſiſtence of the Arabs principally depends : for as theſe people are at continual war with each other, and direct their fury rather againſt the crops than the perſons of their enemies, the whole of them would be unavoidably ſtarved, were it not for this extraordinary reſource. Small villages of ſoldiers are ſcattered up and down this country to guard the grain after it is ſown, which is only that ſpecies of millet named <hi rend="italic">Dora ;</hi> the soil, it is ſaid, being incapable of producing any other. There are great hollows made in the earth at proper diſtances throughout the country, which fill with water in the rainy ſeaſon, and are afterwards of great uſe to the Arabs as they paſs from the cultivated parts to the ſands. The fly, which is ſuch a dreadful enemy to the cattle, is never ſeen to the northward of Shaddly.</p><p>To the weſtward of theſe granaries the country is quite full of trees as far as the river Abiad, or Elaice. In this extenſive plain there ariſe two ridges of mountains, one called <hi rend="italic">Jibbel Moira,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Mountain oſ water ; </hi>the other <hi rend="italic">Jibbel Segud,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Cold Mountain.</hi> Both of them enjoy a fine climate, and ſerve for a protection to the farms about Shaddly and Aboud already mentioned. Here alſo are fortresses placed in the way of the Arabs, which ſerve to oblige them to pay tribute in their flight from the cultivated country, during the rains, to the dry lands of Atbara. Each of theſe diſtricts is governed by the deſcendant of their ancient and native princes, who long reſiſted all the power of the Arabs. Sacrifices of a horrid nature are ſaid to have been offered up on these mountains till about the year 1554, when one of the kings of Sennaar besieged firſt one and then the other of the princes in their mountains ; and having forced them to ſurrender, he faſtened a chain of gold to each of their ears, expoſed them in the market-place at Sennaar, and sold them for ſlaves at leſs than a farthing each. Soon after this they were circumciſed, converted to the Mahometan religion, and reſtored to their kingdoms.</p><p>“ Nothing (says Mr Bruce) is more pleaſant than the country around Sennaar in the end of Auguſt and beginning of September. The grain, being now ſprung up, makes the whole of this immenſe plain appear a level green land, interſperſed with great lakes of water, and ornamented at certain intervals with groups of villages ; the conical tops of the houſes preſenting at a diſtancc the appearance of ſmall encampments. Through</p><p>this very extenſive plain winds the Nile, a delightful river there, above a mile broad, full to the very brim, but never overflowing. Everywhere on theſe banks are ſeen herds of the most beautiful cattle of various kinds. The banks of the Nile about Sennaar reſemble the pleaſanteſt part of Holland in the ſummer ſeaſon ; but ſoon after, when the rains ceaſe, and the sun exerts its utmoſt influence, the dora begins to ripen, the leaves to turn yellow and to rot, the lakes to putrefy, ſmell, become full of vermin, and all its beauty ſuddenly disappears: bare ſcorched Nubia returns, and all its terrors of poiſonous winds and moving ſands, glowing and ventilated with ſultry blaſts, which are followed by a troop of terrible attendants ; epilepſies, apoplexies, violent fevers, obſtinate agues, and lingering painful dyſenteries, ſtill more obſtinate and mortal.</p><p>“ War and treason seem to be the only employment of this horrid people, whom Heaven has ſeparated by almoſt impaſſable deſerts from the rest of mankind; confining them to an accurſed ſpot, ſeemingly to give them an earneſt in time of the only other courſe which he has reſerved to them for an eternal hereafter.”</p><p>With regard to the climate of the country round Sennaar, Mr Bruce has ſeveral very curious obſervations. The thermometer riſes in the ſhade to 119 degrees ; but the degree indicated by this inſtrument does not at all correspond with the ſenſations occaſioned by it; nor with the colour of the people who live under it. “ Nations of blacks (ſays he) live within latitude 13 and 14 degrees; about 10 degrees ſouth of them, nearly under the line, all the people are white, as we had an opportunity of observing daily in the Galla Sennaar, which is in latitude 13 degrees, is hotter by the thermometer 50 degrees, when the sun is moſt diſtant from it, than Gondar, which is a degree farther ſouth, when the fun is vertical.—Cold and hot (ſays our author) are terms merely relative, not determined by the latitude, but elevation of the place. When, therefore, we ſay <hi rend="italic">hot,</hi> ſome other explanation is necessary concerning the place where we are, in order to give an adequate idea of the ſenſations of that heat upon the body, and the effects of it upon the lungs. The degree of the thermometer conveys this but very imperfectly ; 90 degrees is exceſſively hot at Loheia in Arabia Felix ; and yet the latitude of Loheia is but 15 degrees; whereas 90 degrees at Sennaar is only warm as so ſenſe ; though. Sennaar, as we have already ſaid, is in latitude 13 degrees.</p><p>“ At Sennaar, then, I call it <hi rend="italic">cold,</hi> when one fully clothed and at rest feels himſelf in want of fire. I call it <hi rend="italic">cool,</hi> when one fully clothed and at rest feels he could bear more covering all over, or in part, than he has at that time. I call it <hi rend="italic">temperate,</hi> when a man ſo clothed, and at rest, feels no ſuch want, and can take moderate exerciſe, ſuch as walking about a room without ſweating. I call it <hi rend="italic">warm,</hi> when a man, ſo clothed, does not ſweat when at rest; but, upon taking moderate exerciſe, ſweats, and again cools. I call it <hi rend="italic">hot,</hi> when a man at rest, or with moderate exerciſe, ſweats exceſſively. I call it <hi rend="italic">very hot,</hi> when a man with thin, or little clothing, ſweats much, though at rest. I call it <hi rend="italic">exceſſive hot,</hi> when a man, in his ſhirt and at rest, ſweats exceſſively, when all motion is painful, and the knees feel feeble, as if after a fever. I call it <hi rend="italic">extreme hot,</hi> when the ſtrength fails, a disposition to faint comes on, a ſtraitneſs is found</p></body></text></TEI>
