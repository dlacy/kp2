The machinery has no other firm points to •which it can be attached ; and the portion of the Angle rafters which carry this king-poſt are but ſhort, and therefore may be conſiderably loaded with ſafety.</p><p>We obſerve in the drawings which we ſometimes have of Chineſe buildings, that the truſſing of roofs is underſtood by them. Indeed they muſt be very experienced carpenters. We ſee wooden buildings run up to a great height, which can be ſupported only by ſuch truſſing. One of theſe is ſketched in ſig. 21. There are ſome very excellent ſpecimens to be ſeen in the buildings at Deptford, belonging to the victualling-office, uſually called the <hi rend="italic">Red Houſe,</hi>  which were erected about the year 1788, and we believe are the performance of Mr James Arrow of the Board of Works, one of the moſt intelligent artiſts in this kingdom.</p><p>Thus have we given an elementary, but a rational or Scientific, account of this important part of the art of carpentry. It is ſuch, that any practitioner, with the troubleof a little reflection, may always proceed with confidence, and without reſting any part of his practice on the vague notions which habit may have given him of the ſtrength and ſupports of timbers, and of their manner of acting. That theſe frequently miſlead, is proved by the mutual criticiſms which are frequently publiſhed by the rivals in the proſeſſion. They have frequently ſagacity enough (for it can ſeldom be called ſcſence ) to point out glaring blunders ; and any perſon who will look at ſome of the performances of Mr Price, Mr Wyatt, Mr Arrow, and others of acknowdedged reputation, will readily ſee them diſtinguiſhable from the works of inferior artiſts by ſimplicity alone. A man without principles is apt to conſider an intricate conſtruction as ingenious and effectual ; and ſuch roofs ſometimes fail merely by being ingeniouſly loaded with timber, but more frequently ſtill by the wrong action of ſome uſeleſs piece, which produces ſtrains that are tranſverſe to other pieces, or which, by rendering ſome points too firm, cauſe them to be deſerted by the reſt in the general fubſiding of the whole. Inſtances of this kind are pointed out by Price in his Britiſh Carpenter. Nothing ihows the ſkill of a carpenter more than the diſtinctneſs with which he can foreſee the changes of ſhape which muſt take place in a ſhort time in every roof. A knowledge of this will often correct a conſtruction which the mere mathematician thinks unexceptionable, becauſe he does not reckon on the actual compreſſion which muſt obtain, and imagines that his triangles, which ſuſtain no croſs ſtrains, invariably retain their ſhape till the pieces break. The ſagacity of the experienced carpenter is not, however, enough without fci-ence for perfecting the art. But when he knows how much a particular piece will yield to compreſſion in one caſe, ſcience will tell him, and nothing but ſcience can do it, what will be the compreſſion of the ſame piece in another very different caſe. Thus he learns how far it will now yield, and then he proportions the parts ſo to each other, that when all have yielded according to their ſtrains, the whole is of the ſhape he wiſhed to produce, and every joint is in a ſtate of firmneſs. It is here that we obſerve the greateſt number of improprieties. The iron ſtraps are frequently in poſitions not ſuited to the actual ſtrain on them, and they are in a ſtate of violent twiſt, which both tends ſtrongly to</p><p>break the ſtrap, and to cripple the pieces which they ſurround.    *</p><p>In like manner, we frequently ſee joints or mortiſes in a ſtate of violent ſtrain on the tenons, or on the heels and ſhoulders. The joints were perhaps properly ſhaped to the primitive form of the truſs ; but by its ſettling, the bearing on the puſh is changed : the brace, for example, in a very low pitched roof, comes to preſs with the upper part of the ſhoulder, and, acting as a powerful lever on the tenon, breaks it. In like manner, the lower end of the brace, which at firſt butted firmly and ſquarely on the joggle of the king-poſt, now preſſes with one corner with prodigious force, and ſeldom fails to ſplinter off on that fide. We cannot help recommending a maxim of Mr Perronet the celebrated hydraulic architect of France, as a golden rule, viz. to make all the ſhoulders of butting pieces in the form of an arch of a circle, having the oppoſite end of the piece for its centre. Thus, in ſig. 18. if the joggle-joint B be of this form, having A for its centre, the ſagging of the roof will make no partial bearing at the joint ; for in the ſagging of the roof, the piece AB turns or bends round the centre A, and the counter-preſſure of the joggle is ſtill directed to A, as it ought to be. We have juſt now ſaid <hi rend="italic">bends</hi>  round A. This is too frequently the caſe, and it is always very difficult to give the tenon and mortiſe in this place a true and invariable bearing. The rafter puſhes in the direction BA, and the beam reſiſts in the direction AD. The abutment ſhould be perpendicular to neither of theſe but in an intermediate direction, and it ought alſo to be of a curved ſhape. But the carpenters perhaps think that this would weaken the beam too much to give it this ſhape in the ſhoulder ; they do not even aim at it in the heel of the tenon. The ſhoulder is commonly even with the ſurface of the beam. When the bearing therefore is on this ſhoulder, it cauſes the foot of the rafter to Aide along the beam till the heel of the tenon bears againſt the outer end of the mortiſe (See Price’s <hi rend="italic">Bri-tilh Carpenter,</hi>  Plate C. fig. I K). This abutment is perpendicular to the beam in Price’s book, but it is more generally pointed a little outwards below, to make it more ſecure againſt ſtarting. The conſequence of this conſtruction is, that when the roof ſettles, the ſhoulder comes to bear at the inner end of the mortiſe, and it riſes at the outer, and the tenon taking hold of the wood beyond it, either tears ſt out or is itſelf broken. This joint therefore is ſeldom trailed to the ſtrength of the mortiſe and tenon, and is uſually ſecu-red by an iron ſtrap, which lies obliquely to the beam, to which it is bolted by a large bolt quite through, and then embraces the outſide of the rafter foot. Very frequently this ſtrap is not made ſuſſiciently oblique, and we have ſeen ſome made almoſt ſquare with the beam. When this is the caſe, it not only keeps the foot of the rafter from flying out, but it binds it down. In this caſe, the rafter acts as a powerful lever, whoſe fu}crum is the inner angle of the ſhoulder, and then the ſtrap never fails to cripple the rafter at the point. All this can be prevented only by making the ſtrap very long and very oblique, and by making its outer end (the ſtirrup part) ſquare with its length, and making a notch in the rafter foot to receive it. It cannot now cripple the rafter, for it will riſe along with it, turning round</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
