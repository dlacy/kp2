At laſt, Sertorius, hearing that Metellus had ſpoken diſreſpectfully of his courage, challenged his antagoniſt to end the war by single combat ; but Metellus very prudently declined the combat, as being advanced in years; yet this refuſal brought upon him the contempt of the unthinking multitude, upon which Metellus reſolved to retrieve his reputation by ſome ſignal exploit, and therefore laid ſiege to Laeobriga, a conſiderable city in thoſe parts. This he hoped to reduce in two days, as there was but one well in the place ; but Sertorius, having previously removed all thoſe who could be of no ſervice during the liege, and conveyed 6000 ſkins full of water into the city, Metellus continued a long time before it without making any impreſſion. At laſt, his proviſions being almoſt ſpent, he ſent out Aquinus at the head of 6000 men to procure a new ſupply; but Sertorius falling unexpectedly upon them, cut in pieces or took the whole detachment; the commander himſelf being the only man who eſcaped to carry the news of the diſaſter ; upon which Metellus was obliged to raiſe the ſiege with diſgrace.</p><p>And now Sertorius, having gained ſome intervals of eaſe in conſequence of the many advantages he had obtained over the Romans, began to civilize his new ſubjects. Their ſavage and furious manner of fighting he changed for the regular order and diſcipline of a well- formed army ; he bellowed liberally upon them gold and ſilver to adorn their arms, and by converſing familiarly with them, prevailed upon them to lay aſide their own dreſs for the Roman <hi rend="italic">toga.</hi> He ſent for all the children of the principal people, and placed them in the great city of Oſea, now Hereſca, in the kingdom of Arragon, where he appointed them maſters to inſtruct them in the Roman and Greek learning, that they might, as he pretended, be capable of ſharing with him the government of the republic. Thus he made them really hoſtages for the good behaviour of their parents ; however, the latter were greatly pleaſed with the care he took of their children, and all Luſitania were in the higheſt degree attached to their new ſovereign. This attachment he took care to heighten by the power of ſuperſtition ; for having procured a young hind of a milk-white colour, he made it ſo tame that it followed him wherever he went ; and Sertorius gave out to the ignorant multitude, that this hind was inſpired by Diana, and revealed to him the deſigns of his enemies, of which he always took care to be well informed by the great numbers of ſpies he employed.</p><p>While Sertorius was thus employed in eſtabliſhing his authority, the republic of Rome, alarmed at his ſucceſs, reſolved to cruſh him at all events. Sylla was now dead, and all the eminent generals in Rome solicited this honourable though dangerous employment. After much debate a decree was paſſed in favour of Pompey the Great, but without recalling Metellus. In the mean time, the troops of one Perpenna, or Perperna, had, in ſpite of all that their general could do, abandoned him and taken the oath of allegiance to Sertorius. This was a moſt ſignal advantage to Settorius; for Perperna commanded an army of 33,000 men, and had</p><p>come into Spain with a deſign to ſettle there as Sertorius had done ; but as he was deſcended from one of the firſt families in Rome, he thought it below his dignity to ſerve under any general, however eminent he might be. But the troops of Perperna were of a different opinion; and therefore declaring that they would ſerve none but a general who could defend himſelf, they to a man joined Sertorius ; upon which Perperna himſelf, finding he could do no better, conſented to ſerve alſo as a ſubaltern.</p><p>On the arrival of Pompey in Spain, ſeveral of the cities which had hitherto continued faithful to Sertorius began to waver ; upon which the latter reſolved, by ſome ſignal exploit, to convince them that Pompey could no more ſcreen them from his reſentment than Metellus. With this view he laid ſiege to Lauron, now Lirias, a place of conſiderable ſtrength. Pompey, not doubting but he ſhould be able to raiſe the ſiege, marched quite up to the enemy’s lines, and found means to inform the garriſon that thoſe who beſieged them were themſelves beſieged, and would ſoon be obliged to retire with loſs and diſgrace. On hearing this meſſage, “ I will teach Sylla’s diſciple (ſaid Sertorius), that it is the duty of a general to look behind as well as before him.” Having thus ſpoken, he ſent orders to a detachment of 6000 men, who lay concealed among the mountains, to dome down and fall upon his rear if he ſhould offer to force the lines. Pompey, ſurpriſed at their ſudden appearance, durst not ſtir out of his camp ; and in the mean time the beſieged, deſpairing of relief, ſurrendered at diſcretion ; upon which Sertorius granted them their lives and liberty, but reduced their city to aſhes.</p><p>While Sertorius was thus ſucceſsfully contending with Pompey, his quaeſtor Hirtuleius was entirely defeated by Metellus, with the loſs of 20,000 men ; upon which Sertorius advanced with the utmoſt expedition to the banks of the Sucro in Tarraconian Spain, with a deſign to attack Pompey before he could be joined by Metellus. Pompey, on his part, did not decline the combat ; but, fearing that Metellus might ſhare the glory of the victory, advanced with the greateſt expedition. Sertorius put off the battle till towards the evening; Pompey, though he knew that the night would prove diſadvantageous to him, whether vanquiſhed or victorious, becauſe his troops were unacquainted with the country, reſolved to venture an engagement, eſpecially as he feared that Metellus might arrive in the mean time, and rob him of part of the glory of conquering ſo great a commander. Pompey, who commanded his own right wing, ſoon obliged Perperna, who commanded Sertorius’s left, to give way. Hereupon Sertorius himſelf taking upon him the command of that wing, brought back the fugitives to the charge, and obliged Pompey to fly in his turn. In his flight he was overtaken by a gigantic African, who had already lifted up his hand to diſcharge a blow at him with his broad ſword ; but Pompey prevented him by cutting off his right hand at one blow. As he ſtill continued his flight, he was wounded and thrown from his horſe ; so that he would certainly have been taken priſoner, had not the Africans who purſued him quarrelled about the rich furniture of his horſe. This gave an opportunity to the general to make his eſeape ; ſo  that at length he reached his camp with much difficul-</p></body></text></TEI>
