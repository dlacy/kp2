At the end of the 18th century it began to be a centre for trade, reaching its greatest development in 1850-60. Kazan and Turkestan Tatars formed the bulk of its population. The town still remains, however, a collection of old wooden houses scattered among unfenced spaces of sand. The Tatar town has a somewhat better aspect than the Russian. The inhabitants (17,820 in 1881) consist of officials, merchants, and agriculturists.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
