            <p>ROMAN HISTORY.</p>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rome, a city of Italy, formerly the capital of the greatest
                    empire in the world, and still remarkable as the chief seat of the papal power,
                    is situated on the river Tiber, in east long. 13°, and north lat. 41°
                45'.</hi></p>
            <p>To trace, even briefly, the rise and progress of this mighty city towards universal
                empire, would demand a voluminous history, especially were we to enter into
                disquisitions respecting the views which have been adopted in this article; but as
                our limits forbid such an attempt, we must content ourselves in a great measure with
                the statement of general results, with such occasional references as may enable
                our readers to investigate the subject at greater length ; and we think it
                fortunate, that many of the views which were held as mere paradoxes when first
                proposed by Niebuhr, may now be regarded as firmly established, and without
                hesitation followed as essentially correct.</p>
            <p>For the history of the various tribes, which, when united under the Roman name,
                formed one mighty nation, we must refer to the different heads under which, in other
                parts of this work, they are mentioned. The chief of these were the Oscan, probably
                the most ancient race that inhabited Italy ; the Pelasgian, under which designation
                may also be comprised the Tyrrhenian,@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi> with its numerous
                branches ; and the Etrurian, which was marked by various features distinguishing it
                from both the other races, being also probably less ancient than either. From all
                that appears in history or tradition, the Oscan, Opican, Auruncan, and
                Ausonian, were the same race of people, and the earliest inhabitants of that part of
                Italy contained between Oenotria and Tyrrhenia, or the country of the
                    Etruscans;@@<hi rend="sup">2</hi> in a word, they were the original stock whence
                sprung several of the most powerful nations of Italy, as the Sabines or Sabellians,
                the Samnites, and others. The Pelasgi@@<hi rend="sup">3</hi> appear to have been a
                branch of that once mighty race of whom traces may be discovered from the river
                Strymon, along the coast of Ionia, throughout Greece and its islands, and along the
                maritime shores of Italy. It was from their Pelasgic ancestors that the Romans
                derived the radical affinities which are found to connect the Italian language with
                that of Greece, both having had, at some remote period, a common origin. The Pelasgi
                seem to have driven the Oscan nations from the seacoast, back to the mountains, and
                in their turn to have been overpowered in part of their acquired territory by the
                Etruscans. The origin of this latter people is involved in obscurity hitherto
                    impenetrable.@@<hi rend="sup">4</hi> They display many traces of an oriental,
                or, as some think, of an Egyptian origin. We incline, for many reasons, to believe
                them of Phœnician extraction ; not merely the peculiarities of their alphabet,
                but those also of their religious rites, bearing a very close resemblance to the
                most ancient forms of the Phœnician language and religion. Itis probable that a
                careful investigation into tlle customs, laws, and religion of the ancient Etrusci,
                or rather</p>
            <p>Raseni, to use their own name, will ultimately prove them to have belonged to a race
                more ancient still than even the Phoenicians, that is, to the ancient oriental race
                whence the Phœnicians themselves derived their origin, their language, and
                religion.</p>
            <p>Respecting the institutions of these primitive races, very little is known ; yet from
                that little, important conclusions may fairly be drawn. Both the Osci and the
                Pelasgi seem to have lived under the patriarchal form of government; the origin of
                which is to be traced to the paternal sway which a father naturally exercises over
                his household, and tlle head of a tribe, or number of households, over the
                whole collectively. The Etrusci, on tile other hand, appear to have adopted the
                system of <hi rend="italic">castes,</hi> and especially to have been very much under
                the influence of a sacerdotal caste, which was of course hereditary, and which
                possessed almost unbounded influence over tlle rest of the nation. The effect of the
                combination of these natrons, and their peculiar institutions, in forming the
                character of the Roman people, will soon appear.</p>
            <p>Rome itself is said to have been founded in the year 753b .c. This date, therefore,
                we shall assume as the most probable, if not absolutely authentic, and shall make it
                the basis of all subsequent chronological statements.@@<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                According to the fabulous accounts preserved by Livy, the founders and earliest
                inhabitants of Rome were of Trojan descent. Æneas is said to have led a colony of
                Trojans, after the destruction of Troy, through a series of perilous voyages and
                adventures, to the shores of Italy, near the mouth of the Tiber. Here he formed an
                alliance with Latinus, king of the adjoining country, received his daughter Lavinia
                in marriage, and built a town, called, from her name, Lavinium. A war, which soon
                afterwards arose between the new settlers and the Rutulians, terminated in the death
                of their king, Turnus, who was slain in battle by Æneas. Another war ensued between
                the Trojans and Mezentius, king of the Etruscans of Caere. In this war Æneas himself
                perished, having been drowned in the Numicius, into which he was forced in
                a disastrous battle, and was succeeded by his son Ascanius, or lulus. On the banks
                of the river where he disappeared, an altar was built in honour of him, and he was
                worshipped under the name of Jupiter Indiges. Mezentius soou afterwards fell by the
                hand of Ascanius, who thus obtained undisputed possession of the territory formerly
                held by Latinus. The Trojan settlers became completely incorporated with the people
                of the land, and from king Latinus they derived the common name of Latins. The
                thirty years had now elapsed dining which it had been predicted that the Trojan race
                were to inhabit their first town, Lavinium. They removed to a more propitious
                situation, and built a new town on a lofty ridge farther inland, which overlooks all
                the land around it, and to their new abode they gave the name of Alba Longa. Of the
                Latian confederacy, this became the chief city ; and hither the thirty confederate
                cities of Latium resorted to offer common sacrifices to the gods of the Pelasgic
                nation.</p>
            <p>The traditionary legends proceed to state, that Lavinia, fearing some injustice from
                Ascanius, had sought shelter in the woods, where she gave birth to a son, named from
                that circumstance, and from his lather, Æneas Sylvius. Ascanius, however, took no
                unfair advantage of his position, and was succeeded by Sylvius. For an uncertain
                period, the sceptre was swayed by successive monarchs of the Sylvian race and name,
                till the death of Procas. This king left two sons, Numitor and Amulius, but by
                birthright the throne belonged to Numitor. Amulius, however, seizing the government
                in defiance of his brother’s right, caused Numitor’s only son to be put to death,
                and made his daugh-</p>
