The comma and point, when applied to <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> is to be placed, as in Plate CCCCLXXXII. at the top of the next character ; when for <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> oppoſite to the middle ; and when for i and <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> at the bottom.</p><p>This arrangement of the vowels is the moſt ſimple and diſtinct that can eaſily be imagined. Places at the top, the middle, and the bottom of characters, which make three different poſitions, are as eaſily diſtinguiſhed from one another as any three ſeparate characters could be ; and a comma is made with the ſame facility as a point.</p><p>Simple lines may be drawn four different ways ; perpendicular, horizontal, and with an angle of about 45 degrees to the right and left. An aſcending oblique line to the right, which will be perfectly diſtinct from the rest when joined to any other character, may likewiſe be admitted. Theſe characters being the ſimplest in nature, are aſſigned to those five consonants which moſt frequently occur, viz. l<hi rend="italic">, r, t, c</hi> hard or <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> ſoft or s<hi rend="smallcaps">.</hi></p><p>Every’ circle may be divided with a perpendicular and horizontal line, ſo as to form likewiſe four diſtinct characters. Theſe being the next to lines in the ſimplicity of their formation, we have appropriated them for <hi rend="italic">b, d, n,</hi> and m<hi rend="italic">.</hi></p><p>The characters expreſſing nine of the conſonants are all perfectly diſtinct from one another ; eight only remain which are needful, viz. f<hi rend="italic">, g</hi> or <hi rend="italic">j, b, p, q, v, w, </hi>and x<hi rend="italic">.</hi> To find characters for which we muſt have recourſe to mixed curves and lines. The characters which we have adopted are the ſimpleſt in nature after thoſe already applied, admit of the eaſieſt joining, and tend to preſerve lineality and beauty in the writing.</p><p>It muſt be obſerved that we have no character for <hi rend="italic">c </hi>when it has a hard found, as in <hi rend="italic">castle ;</hi> or ſoft, as in <hi rend="italic">citv ;</hi> for it naturally takes the found of <hi rend="italic">k</hi> or <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> which in all caſes will be sufficient to ſupply its place.</p><p><hi rend="italic">R</hi> likewiſe is repreſented by the ſame character as l; only with this difference, r is written with an aſcending ſtroke @@(I), and l with a deſcending ; which is always to be known from the manner of its union with the following character ; but in a few monolyllables where <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is the only conſonant in the word, and conſequently ſtands alone, it is to be made as is ſhown in the alphabet for diſtinction’s sake.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Z,</hi> as it is a letter ſeldom employed in the Engliſh language, and only a coarſer and harder expreſſion of <hi rend="smallcaps">j, </hi>muſt be ſupplied by <hi rend="smallcaps">j</hi> whenever it occurs ; as for <hi rend="italic">Zede- kiah</hi> write <hi rend="italic">Sedekiah,</hi> &amp;c.</p><p>CHAP. IV.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> prepoſitions and terminations in this ſcheme are ſo ſimple, that the greateſt benefit may be reaped from them, and very little trouble required to attain them ; as the incipient letter or the incipient conſonant of all the prepoſitions and of ſeveral of the terminations is uſed to express the whole. But although in Plate CCCCLXXXII. sufficient specimens are given of the manner of their application, that the learner of leſs ingenuity or more flow perception may have every aſſiſtance, we have ſubjoined the following directions.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> 1. The prepoſition is always to be written without joining, yet ſo near as plainly to ſhow what word it belongs to ; and the beſt way is to obſerve the ſame order as if the whole was to be connected.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> II. A prepoſition, though the ſame letters that conſtitute it may be met with in the middle or end of a word, is never to be uſed, becauſe it would expoſe to obſcurity.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> III. Obſerve that the prepoſition <hi rend="italic">omni</hi> is expressed by the vowel o in its proper poſition ; and for <hi rend="italic">anti, anta, ante,</hi> by the vowel <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> which the radical part of the word will eaſily diſtinguiſh from being only ſimple vowels.</p><p>The firſt rule for the prepoſitions is (allowing ſuch exceptions as may be ſeen in the Plate) to be obſerved for the terminations ; and alſo the ſecond <hi rend="italic">mutatis mutandis ;</hi> except that whenever si<hi rend="italic">s, lus, ſys, cious, tiοus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ces</hi> occur, they are to be expreſſed as directed in the fourth rule for the conſonants, whether in the beginning, middle, or end of words @@(K).</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> IV. The terminative character for <hi rend="italic">tion, sion, don, dan, tian,</hi> is to be expreſſed by a ſmall circle joined to the neareſt letter, and turned to the right ; and the plurals <hi rend="italic">tions, sions, cions, cians, tians, tience,</hi> by a dot on the ſame ſide.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> V. The terminative character for <hi rend="italic">ing,</hi> is to be expreſſed likewiſe by a ſmall circle, but drawn to the left hand ; and its plural <hi rend="italic">ings</hi> by a dot @@<hi rend="smallcaps">(l).</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> VI. The plural sign r is to be added to the terminative characters when neceſſary.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rule</hi> VII. The ſeparated terminations are never to be uſed but in polysyllables or words of more Syllables than one.</p><p>Theſe rules duly obſerved will point out a method as conciſe and elegant as can be deſired, for expreſſing the moſt frequent and longeſt prepoſitions and terminations in the Engliſh language. If it ſhould be thought neceſſary to increase their number by the addition of others, it will be an eaſy matter for any one of the leaſt diſcernment to do ſo, by proceeding on the principles before laid down.</p><p>CHAP. V.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Though</hi> a more conciſe method of writing, or more numerous abbreviations, may not be indiſpenſably neceſſary, if the foregoing directions be practiſed for a conſiderable time, yet contractions will be found ex-</p><p>@@@(I) The character for <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> wſhen lineality requires it, may be made from the bottom and inverted (see Plate CCCCLXXXII.) And often <hi rend="italic">b</hi> may be omitted entirely, or a vowel may be ſubſtituted in its ſtead, without any injury to legibility, it being rather a breathing than letter.</p><p>@@@(K) But in a few words where three horizontal characters meet, it will be better to expreſs the sis, &amp;c. by the ſemielliptical character in Plate CCCCLXXXII. oppoſite <hi rend="italic">tious.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">@@@(l)</hi> In horizontal characters, by the left hand is meant the top, and by the right the ſpace below the letter (ſee ing joined, Plate CCCCLXXXII). In all other characters the right and left poſitions will naturally be known.</p></body></text></TEI>
