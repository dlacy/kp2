<p><span class="font0">avert this loss Raleigh, partly out of his own pocket and partly by securing the help of courtiers and capitalists, provided the&nbsp;means for the expedition to Newfoundland in 1583, in which&nbsp;Gilbert, who had been reduced to sell “ the clothes off his&nbsp;wife’s back ” by his previous misfortunes, finally perished. Sir&nbsp;Humphrey’s patent was renewed in favour of Sir Walter in&nbsp;March 1584.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Raleigh now began the short series of ventures in colonization which have connected his name with the settlement of Virginia.&nbsp;It has often been said that Raleigh showed a wise originality&nbsp;in his ideas as to colonization. But in truth the patent granted&nbsp;to him, which gave him and his heirs the proprietary right&nbsp;over all territory they occupied subject to payment of one-fifth&nbsp;of the produce of all mines of precious metals to the crown,&nbsp;is drawn closely on Spanish precedents. Nor was there any&nbsp;originality in his desire to settle English colonists, and encourage&nbsp;other industries than mining. The Spaniards had pursued&nbsp;the same aim from the first. In April 1584 Raleigh sent out&nbsp;two captains, Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe, on a voyage&nbsp;of exploration. They sailed by the Canaries to Florida, and&nbsp;from thence followed the coast of North America as far as&nbsp;the inlet between Albemarle and Pamlico sounds in the modern&nbsp;state of North Carolina. The name of Virginia was given to&nbsp;a vast and undefined territory, but none of Raleigh’s captains&nbsp;or settlers reached the state of Virginia. In the same year&nbsp;he became member of parliament for Devonshire, and took&nbsp;the precaution to secure a parliamentary confirmation of his&nbsp;grant. His first body ol settlers, sent out in 1585 under Sir&nbsp;Richard Grenville, landed on what is now Roanoke Island&nbsp;in North Carolina Sir R. Grenville showed himself mainly&nbsp;intent on taking prizes, going and coming. The settlers got&nbsp;on bad terms with the natives, despaired, and deserted the&nbsp;colony when Sir Francis Drake visited the coast in 1586.&nbsp;Attempts at colonization at the same place in 1586 and 1587&nbsp;proved no more successful (see North Carolina), and in&nbsp;1589 Raleigh, who represented himself as having spent £40,000&nbsp;on the venture, resigned his rights to a company of merchants,&nbsp;preserving to himself a rent, and a fifth of whatever gold might&nbsp;be discovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After 1587 Sir Walter Raleigh was called upon to fight for his place of favourite with the earl of Essex (see Essex, 2nd&nbsp;Earl of). During the Armada year 1588 he was more or less&nbsp;in eclipse. He was in Ireland for part of the year with Sir R.&nbsp;Grenville, and was employed as vice-admiral of Devon in&nbsp;looking after the coast-defences and militia levy of the county.&nbsp;During this year he received a challenge from Essex which did&nbsp;not lead to an encounter. In 1589 he was again in Ireland.&nbsp;He had already made the acquaintance of Edmund Spenser&nbsp;and now visited him at his house at Kilcolman. It was by&nbsp;Raleigh’s help that Spenser obtained a pension, and royal aid&nbsp;to publish the first three books of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Faerie Queen.</span><span class="font0"> The&nbsp;exact cause of Raleigh’s partial disgrace at court is not known,&nbsp;but it was probably due to the queen’s habitual policy of checking one favourite by the promotion of another. In 1589 he&nbsp;accompanied the expedition to the coast of Portugal, which&nbsp;was intended to cause a revolt against King Philip II., but&nbsp;failed completely. In 1591 he was at the last moment forbidden&nbsp;to take part in the voyage to the Azores, and was replaced by his&nbsp;cousin Sir R. Grenville, whose death in action with the Spaniards&nbsp;was the subject of one of Sir Walter’s most vigorous pieces of&nbsp;prose writing. In 1592 he was again at sea with an expedition&nbsp;to intercept the Spanish trade, but was recalled by the queen.&nbsp;The cause of his recall was the discovery that he had seduced&nbsp;one of her maids of honour, Elizabeth Throgmorton. Raleigh&nbsp;denied in a letter to Robert Cecil that there was any truth in&nbsp;the stories of a marriage between them. On his return he was&nbsp;put into the Tower, and if he was not already married was&nbsp;married there. - To placate the queen he made a fantastic&nbsp;display of despair at the loss of her favour. It must be remembered that the maids of honour could not marry without&nbsp;the consent of the queen, which Elizabeth was always most&nbsp;reluctant to give and would be particularly unwilling to give&nbsp;when the husband was an old favourite of her own. Raleigh&nbsp;proved a good husband and his wife was devoted to him through&nbsp;life. As the ships of the expedition had taken a valuable prize,&nbsp;the Portuguese carrack “ Madre de Dios,” and as there was a&nbsp;dispute over the booty, he was released to superintend the&nbsp;distribution. He had been a large contributor to the cost of&nbsp;the expedition, but the queen, who sent only two ships, took&nbsp;the bulk of the spoil, leaving him barely enough to cover his&nbsp;expenses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Raleigh now retired from court to an estate at Sherborne in Dorsetshire, which just before his disgrace he had extorted from&nbsp;the bishop of Salisbury, to whose see it belonged, by a most&nbsp;unscrupulous use of the royal influence. A son was born to him&nbsp;here in 1594, and he kept up a friendly correspondence with Sir&nbsp;Robert Cecil, afterwards earl of Salisbury, the secretary of state.&nbsp;But a life of constant retirement was uncongenial to Raleigh,&nbsp;and as his profuse habits, together with the multiplicity of&nbsp;his interests, had prevented him from making any advantage&nbsp;out of his estates in Ireland, he was embarrassed for money.&nbsp;In 1595 he therefore sailed on a voyage of exploration with a&nbsp;view to conquest, on the coast of South America. The object&nbsp;was undoubtedly to find gold mines, and Raleigh had heard the&nbsp;wild stories of El Dorado which had been current among the&nbsp;Spaniards for long. His account of his voyage, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Discoυerie&nbsp;of Guiana,</span><span class="font0"> published on his return, is the most brilliant of all the&nbsp;Elizabethan narratives of adventure, but contains much manifest&nbsp;romance. It was received with incredulity. He was now the&nbsp;most unpopular man in England, not only among the courtiers,&nbsp;but in the nation, for his greed, arrogance and alleged scepticism&nbsp;in religion. In 1590 he was named with the poet Marlowe and&nbsp;others as an atheist. At court he was not at first received.&nbsp;The share he took in the capture of Cadiz in 1596, where he was&nbsp;seriously wounded, was followed by a restoration of favour at&nbsp;court, and he was apparently reconciled to Essex, whom he&nbsp;accompanied on a voyage to the Azores in 1597. This co-operation led to a renewal of the quarrel, and Raleigh, as the&nbsp;enemy of Essex who was the favourite of the soldiers and the&nbsp;populace, became more unpopular than ever. In 1600 he&nbsp;obtained the governorship of Jersey, and in the following year&nbsp;took a part in suppressing the rebellion of Essex, at whose&nbsp;execution he presided as captain of the Guard. In 1600 he sat&nbsp;as member for Penzance in the last parliament of Elizabeth’s&nbsp;reign. In parliament he was a steady friend of religious tolera-tion, and a bold critic of the fiscal and agrarian legislation of the&nbsp;time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The death of the queen and the accession of James I. were ruinous to Raleigh. James, who looked upon Essex as his&nbsp;partisan, had been prejudiced, and Raleigh’s avowed desire for&nbsp;the prolongation of the war with Spain was utterly against the&nbsp;peace policy of the king. Raleigh was embarrassed for money,&nbsp;and had been compelled to sell his Irish estates to Richard&nbsp;Boyle, afterwards 1st earl of Cork, in 1602. He was expelIed&nbsp;from Durham House, which was reclaimed by the bishop,&nbsp;dismissed from the captaincy of the Guard, deprived of his&nbsp;monopolies, which the king abolished, and of the government of&nbsp;Jersey. In his anger and despair he unquestionably took some&nbsp;part in the complication of conspiracies which arose in the first&nbsp;months of James’s reign, and was committed to the Tower on&nbsp;the 19th of July 1603. Here he made what appears to have&nbsp;been an insincere attempt to stab himself, but only inflicted a&nbsp;small wound. His trial at Winchester, November 1603, was&nbsp;conducted with such outrageous unfairness as to shock the&nbsp;opinion ‘of the time, and his gallant bearing in face of the&nbsp;brutality of the Attorney-General, Sir Edward Coke, turned&nbsp;public opinion in his favour. It is now impossible to reach the&nbsp;truth, but on the whole it appears probable that Raleigh was&nbsp;cognizant of the conspiracies, though the evidence produced&nbsp;against him was insufficient to prove his guilt. Much was kept&nbsp;back by the council, and the jury was influenced by knowing&nbsp;that the council thought him guilty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The sentence of death passed on Raleigh, and others tried at about the same time, was in most cases not carried out.</span></p>
