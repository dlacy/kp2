<p><span class="font1">The fall of Nero and the extinction of the “ progeny of the Caesars ” was followed by a war of succession which revealed the military basis of the Principate and the&nbsp;weakness of the tie connecting the emperor with Rome.&nbsp;Galba, Otho, Vitellius and Vespasian represented in turn&nbsp;the legions of Spain, the household troops, the army of&nbsp;the Rhine, and a coalition of the armies of the Danube&nbsp;and the Euphrates; and all except Otho were already&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span class="font1"> emperors when they entered Rome. The final&nbsp;survivor in the struggle, Vespasian </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 69-79), was a man of&nbsp;comparatively humble origin, and as the Principate ceased to&nbsp;possess the prestige of high descent it became imperatively</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">necessary to remove, as far as possible, the anomalies of the office and to give it a legitimate and permanent&nbsp;form. Thus we find an elaborate and formal system&nbsp;of titles substituted for the personal names of the&nbsp;Julio-Claudian emperors, an increasing tendency to&nbsp;insist on the inherent prerogatives of the Principate (such as&nbsp;the censorial power), and an attempt to invest Caesarism with&nbsp;an hereditary character, either by natural descent or by adoption, while the worship of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Divi,</span><span class="font1"> or deified Caesars, was made&nbsp;the symbol of its continuity and legitimacy. The dynasty of&nbsp;Vespasian and his sons (Titus, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">d.</span><span class="font1"> 79-81, Domi tian, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 81-96)&nbsp;became extinct on the murder of the last named, whose highhanded treatment of the senate earned him the name of a tyrant;&nbsp;his successor, Nerva,(A.D. 96-98), opened the series of “ adoptive ” emperors (Trajan, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 98-117, Hadrian, 117-38,&nbsp;Antoninus Pius, 138-61, Marcus Aurelius, 161-80) under&nbsp;whose rule the empire enjoyed a period of internal tranquillity&nbsp;and good government. Its boundaries were extended by the&nbsp;subjugation of northern Britain (by Agricola, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 78-84; see&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Britain, § </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roman),</span><span class="font1"> by the annexation of the districts included&nbsp;in the angle of the Rhine and Danube under the Flavian&nbsp;emperors, and by the conquest of Dacia (the modern Transylvania) under Trajan (completed in </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 106). Trajan also&nbsp;annexed Arabia Petraea and in his closing years invaded&nbsp;Parthia and formed provinces of Armenia, Mesopotamia&nbsp;and Assyria; but these conquests were surrendered by his&nbsp;successor, Hadrian, who set himself to the task of consolidating the empire and perfecting its defences. To him is&nbsp;due the system of permanent </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">limites</span><span class="font1"> or frontier fortifications,&nbsp;such as the wall which protected northern Britain and the&nbsp;palisade which replaced the chain of forts established by&nbsp;the Flavian emperors from the Rhine to the Danube.@@<sup>1</sup> The&nbsp;construction of these defences showed that the limit of&nbsp;expansion had been reached, and under M. Aurelius the&nbsp;tide began to turn. A great part of his reign was occupied&nbsp;with wars against the Marcomanni, Quadi, Sarmatians, &amp;c.,&nbsp;whose irruptions seriously threatened the security of Italy.&nbsp;Henceforth Rome never ceased to be on the defensive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Within the frontiers the levelling and unifying process commenced by Augustus had steadily proceeded. A tolerably uniform provincial system&nbsp;covered the whole area of the empire. The client&nbsp;states had one by one been reconstituted as provinces, and even&nbsp;the government of Italy had been in many respects assimilated&nbsp;to the provincial type. The municipal system had&nbsp;spread widely; the period from Vespasian to Aurelius&nbsp;witnessed the elevation to municipal rank of an immense number of communities, not only in the old&nbsp;provinces of the West, in Africa, Spain and Gaul, but&nbsp;in the newer provinces of the North, and along the line of the&nbsp;northern frontier; and everywhere under the influence of the&nbsp;central imperial authority there was an increasing uniformity</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">in the form of the local constitutions, framed and granted as they all were by imperial edict.@@<sup>2</sup> Throughout the&nbsp;empire again the extension of the Roman franchise&nbsp;was preparing the way for the final act by which&nbsp;Caracalla assimilated the legal status of all free-born&nbsp;inhabitants of the empire,@@<sup>3</sup> and in the west and north&nbsp;this was preceded and accompanied by the complete Romanizing of the people in language and civilization. Yet, in spite&nbsp;of the internal tranquillity and the good government which have&nbsp;made the age of the Antonines famous, we can detect signs of&nbsp;weakness. It was in this period that the centralization of&nbsp;authority in the hands of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">princeps</span><span class="font1"> was completed; the “ dual&nbsp;control ” established by Augustus, which had been unreal&nbsp;enough in the 1st century, was now, though not formally&nbsp;abolished, systematically ignored in practice. The senate&nbsp;ceased to be an instrument of government, and became an&nbsp;imperial peerage, largely composed of men not qualified by&nbsp;election to the quaestorship but directly ennobled by the&nbsp;emperor.@@<sup>4</sup> The restricted sphere of administration left by&nbsp;Augustus to the old magistracies was still further narrowed;&nbsp;their jurisdiction, for example, tended to pass into the hands&nbsp;of the Greek officers appointed by Caesar—the prefect of the&nbsp;city and the prefect of the guards. The complete organization&nbsp;of Caesar’s own administrative service, and its recognition as a&nbsp;state bureaucracy, was chiefly the work of Hadrian, who took&nbsp;the secretaryships out of the hands of freedmen and entrusted&nbsp;them to procurators of equestrian rank.@@<sup>5</sup> All these changes,&nbsp;inevitable, and in some degree beneficial, as they were, brought&nbsp;with them the attendant evils of excessive centralization.&nbsp;Though these were hardly felt while the central authority was&nbsp;wielded by vigorous rulers, yet even under Trajan, Hadrian and&nbsp;the Antonines we notice a failure of strength in the empire as a&nbsp;whole, and a corresponding increase of pressure on the imperial&nbsp;government itself. The reforms of Augustus had given free&nbsp;play to powers still fresh and vigorous. The ceaseless labours&nbsp;of Hadrian were directed mainly to the careful husbanding of&nbsp;such strength as still remained, or to attempts at reviving it by&nbsp;the sheer force of imperial authority. Among the symptoms of&nbsp;incipient decline were the growing depopulation, especially of the&nbsp;central districts of the empire, the constant financial difficulties,&nbsp;the deterioration in character of the local governments in the&nbsp;provincial communities,@@<sup>6</sup> and the increasing reluctance exhibited by all classes to undertake the now onerous burden of&nbsp;municipal office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is to such facts as these that we must look in passing a final judgment on the imperial government, which is admittedly&nbsp;seen in its best and most perfect form in the Antonine period.&nbsp;In our review of the conditions which brought about the fall&nbsp;of the Roman Republic, we saw that the collapse of the city-state made Caesarism inevitable, since the extension of federal&nbsp;and representative institutions to a world-empire lay beyond&nbsp;the horizon of ancient thought. The benefits which Caesarism&nbsp;conferred upon mankind are plain. In the first place, the&nbsp;Roman world, which had hitherto not been governed in the&nbsp;true sense of the word, but exploited in the interests of a&nbsp;dominant clique, now received an orderly and efficient government, under which the frightful ravages of misrule and civil&nbsp;strife were repaired. The financial resources of the empire&nbsp;were husbanded by skilled and, above all, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">trained</span><span class="font1"> administrators,&nbsp;to whom the imperial service offered a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">carrière owverte aux&nbsp;talents;</span><span class="font1"> many of these were Greeks, or half-Greek Orientals,&nbsp;whose business capacity formed an invaluable asset hitherto</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
