                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles François ]Marie, Comte de</hi> (1797-1875), French
                    politician and man of letters, was born at Paris on the 13th March 1797.. His
                    father, also Comte de Rémusat, of a good though not very dis-! tinguished family
                    in the district of Toulouse, was a man of ! considerable literary taste, of much
                    administrative ability, and of moderate Liberal views in politics. He was
                    chamberlain to Napoleon, but disapproved of the emperor’s absolutist government
                    and aggressive policy, and after the restoration became prefect first of the
                    Haute Garonne and then of the Nord. His wife (mother of Charles) was a still
                    more remarkable person, whose full abilities have only recently been made known.
                    Her maiden name was Claire Elisabeth Jeanne Gravier de Vergennes. She was born
                    in 1780, and was early introduced to the salons, which reopened after the
                    cessation of the Terror. She married the Comte de Rémusat when she was very
                    young, and was ! long attached to the service of Josephine, to whom she was</p>

                <p>finally <hi rend="italic">dame du palais.</hi> Talleyrand was a particular
                    admirer of hers, and she was generally recognized as a woman of great
                    intellectual capacity as well as of much personal grace and charm. After her
                    death (1824) an <hi rend="italic">Essai sur</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">VLfucation des Femmes</hi> was published and received an
                    academic <hi rend="italic">couronne.</hi> But it was not till 1879, when her
                    grandson M. Paul de Remusat published her memoirs, which have since been
                    followed by some correspondence with her son, that justice could be generally
                    done to her literary talent. The light thrown on the Napoleonic court by this
                    remarkable book was great, and !Madame de Remusat appeared as hardly the
                    inferior of the best memoir and letter writers of the previous century. The same
                    documents contained much information on the youth and education of her son
                    Charles. He very early developed political views more decidedly Liberal than
                    those of his parents, and, being bred to the bar, published in 1820 a short
                    pamphlet on jury trial. He was also an active journalist, showing in philosophy
                    and literature the special influence of Cousin. He was, however, at the same
                    time a thorough man of the world, and is said to have furnished to no small
                    extent the original of Balzac’s brilliant egoist Henri de Marsay. He took no
                    active part in politics till the revolution of July, when he signed the
                    journalists’ protest against the Ordinances, and in the following October was
                    elected deputy for Toulouse. He then ranked himself with the “doctrinaires,” and
                    supported (being a speaker of no small power) most of those measures of
                    restriction on popular liberty which rapidly made the July monarchy unpopular
                    with French Radicals. In 1836 he became under-secretary of state for the
                    interior, but did not hold the post lo <hi rend="sub">v</hi> ng. He then became
                    an ally of Thiers, and in 1840 held the ministry of the interior for a short
                    time. In the same year he became an Academician.</p>
                <p>For the rest of Louis Philippe’s reign lie was in opposition till he joined
                    Thiers in his brief and hopeless attempt at a ministry in the spring of 1848.
                    During this time Remusat constantly spoke in the chamber, but was still more
                    active in literature, especially on philosophical subjects,—the most remarkable
                    of his works being his book on <hi rend="italic">Abélard</hi> (1845). In 1848 he
                    was elected, and in 1849 re-elected, for the department of Haute Garonne and sat
                    on the Conservative side. But he would not support Louis Napoleon, and had to
                    leave France after the <hi rend="italic">coup d’état ;</hi> nor did he re-enter
                    political life at all during the second empire, though his son M. Paul de
                    Remusat stood for the Haute Garonne, and was very nearly elected, in 1869. Nor
                    would he at first accept the advances made him after the establishment of the
                    third republic. In 1871 he was appointed minister of foreign affairs and
                    accepted the post. Although minister he was not a deputy, and on standing for
                    Paris in September 1873 he was beaten by M. Barodet. A month later he was
                    elected (having already resigned with Thiers) for the Haute Garonne by a very
                    great majority. He died at Paris on the 6th April 1875.</p>
                <p>During his long abstention from political life Remusat continued to write on his
                    favourite subjects of philosophical history and especially English philosophical
                    history. <hi rend="italic">Saint Anselme de Cantor-béry</hi> appeared in 1854 ;
                        <hi rend="italic">L’Angleterre au XVII Feme siècle</hi> in 1856 (2d ed.
                    enlarged, 1865); <hi rend="italic">Bacon, sa vie, son temps, dec.,</hi> in 1858
                    ; <hi rend="italic">Channing, sa vie et ses œuvres,</hi> in 1862; <hi
                        rend="italic">John Wesley</hi> in 1870; <hi rend="italic">Lord Herbert of
                        Chcrbury</hi> in 1874 ; <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la philosophie en
                        Angleterre depuis Bacon jusqu’à Locke,</hi> in 1875 ; besides other and
                    minor works. The impression derived from these and from the political records of
                    his life is that he was on the whole one of those men whose performances are
                    unequal to their powers. He wrote well, was a forcible speaker, and an acute
                    critic ; but his adoption of the indeterminate eclecticism of Cousin in
                    philosophy and of the somewhat similarly indeterminate liberalism of Thiers in
                    politics probably had a bad effect on him, though both no doubt accorded with
                    his critical and unenthusiastic turn of mind.</p>
