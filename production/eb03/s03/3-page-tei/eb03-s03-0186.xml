            <p>axis the cylinder AFG, in order that the tranſverſe ſection KH (n<hi
                    rend="superscript">o</hi> 2.) at the counter may be a circle revolving upon its
                centre ; in which caſe the ſpace of halt an inch is more than ſufficient between the
                rudder and the counter, and conſequently the neceſſity of a rudder coat entirely
                done away. But as it was fore- ſeen, that if the rudder by any accident was
                unſhipped, this alteration might endanger the tearing away of the counter, the hole
                is made much larger than the tranſverſe ſection of the cylindric part of the rudder,
                and the ſpace between filled up with pieces of wood ſo fitted to the counter as to
                be capable of withſtanding the ſhock of the ſea, but to be easily carried away with
                the rudder, leaving the counter, under ſuch circumſtances, in as ſafe a ſtate as it
                would be agreeable in the preſent form of making rudders in the navy.</p>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> VIII. <hi rend="italic">Upon the Positiοn of the Load
                    water Line, and the Capacity of a Ship.</hi></p>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> weight of the quantity of water diſplaced by the bottom
                of a ſhip is equal to the weight of the ſhip with its rigging, provisions, and every
                thing on board. If therefore the exact weight of the ſhip when ready for ſea be
                calculated, and alſo the number of cubic feet in the ſhip’s bottom below the
                load-water line, and hence the weight of the water she diſplaces ; it will be known
                if the load-water line is properly placed in the draught.</p>
            <p>The poſition of the ſhip in the draught may be either on an even keel, or to draw
                moſt water abaft ; but an even keel is judged to be the beſt poſition in point of
                velocity, when the ſhip is conſtructed ſuitable thereto, that is, when her natural
                poſition is ſuch. For when a ſhip is conſtructed to ſwim by the ſtern, and when
                brought down to her load-water made to ſwim on an even keel (as is the caſe with
                moſt ships that are thus built), her velocity is by that means greatly retarded, and
                alſo her ſtrength greatly diminiſhed : for the forepart being brought down lower
                than it ſhould be, and the middle of the ſhip maintaining its proper depth in the
                water, the after part is by that means lifted, and the ſhip is then upon an even
                keel : but in conſequence of her being out of her natural poſition, the after part
                is always preſſing downwards with a conſiderable ſtrain, which will continue till
                the ſhip’s ſheer is entirely broke, and in time would fall into its natural poſition
                again : for which reaſon we ſee ſo many ſhips with broken backs, that is, with their
                ſheers altered in ſuch a manner that the ſheer rounds up, and the highest part is in
                the midſhips.</p>
            <p>Such are the diſadvantages ariſing from not paying a due attention to thoſe points in
                the conſtruction of a draught ; therefore, when the load-water line is found to be
                ſo situated at a proper height on the draught, according to the weight given for
                ſuch a ſhip, and alſo drawn parallel to the keel, as ſuppoſing that to be the beſt
                ſailing trim, the next thing is to examine whether the body is conſtructed ſuitable
                thereto, in order to avoid the above-mentioned ill conſequences.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, therefore, we muſt divide the ſhip equally in two lengthwiſe
                between the fore and after perpendiculars; and the exact number of cubic feet in the
                whole bottom beneath the load-water line being</p>
            <p>known, we muſt find whether the number of cubic feet in each part ſo divided are the
                ſame ; and if they are found to be equal, the body of the ſhip may then he ſaid to
                be conſtructed in all reſpects ſuitable to her ſwimming on an even keel, let the
                ſhape of the body be whatever it will ; and which will be found to be her natural
                poſition at the load-water line. But if either of the parts ſhould contain a greater
                number of cubic feet than the other, that part which contains the greatest will ſwim
                the moſt out of the water, and consequently the other will ſwim deepeſt, ſuppoſing
                the ſhip in her natural poſition for that conſtruction. In order, therefore, to
                render the ſhip ſuitably conſtructed to the load-water line in the draught, which is
                parallel to the keel, the number of cubic feet in the leſs part muſt be ſubtracted
                from the number contained in the greater part, and that part of the body is to be
                filled out tilt it has increaſed half the difference of their quantities, and the
                other part is to be drawn in as much : hence the two parts will be equal, that is,
                each will contain the ſame number of cubic feet, and the ſhip’s body will be
                conſtructed in a manner ſuitable to her ſwimming on an even keel.</p>
            <p>If it is propoſed that the ſhip laid down on the draught ſhall not ſwim on an even
                keel, but draw more water abaft than afore, then the fore and after parts of the
                ſhip’s body below the load-water line are to be compared ; and if theſe parts are
                unequal, that part which is leaſt is to be filled out by half the difference, and
                the other part drawn in as much as before.</p>
            <p>It will be neceſſary, in the firſt place, to calculate the weight of a ſhip ready
                equipped for ſea, from the knowledge of the weight of every ſeparate thing in her
                and belonging to her, as the exact weight of all the timber, iron, lead, maſts,
                sails, rigging, and in ſhort all the materials, men, proviſions, and every thing
                elſe on board of her, from which we ſhall be able afterwards to judge of the truth
                of the calculation, and whether the load-water line in the draught be placed
                agreeable thereto. This is indeed a very laborious taſk, upon account of the ſeveral
                pieces of timber, &amp;c. being of ſo many different figures, and the ſpecific
                gravity of some of the timber entering the conſtruction not being preciſely
                determined.</p>
            <p>In order to aſcertain the weight of the hull, the timber is the firſt thing which
                comes under conſideration : the number of cubic feet of timber contained in the
                whole fabric muſt be found ; which we ſhall be able to do by help of the draught and
                the principal dimensions and ſcantlings ; obſerving to diſtinguiſh the different
                kinds of timber from each other, as they differ considerably in weight ; then the
                number of cubic feet contained in the different forts of timber being reduced into
                pounds, and added, will be the weight of the timber. In like manner proceed to find
                the weight of the iron, lead, paint, &amp;c. and the true weight of the whole will
                be found.</p>
            <p>In reducing quantity to weight, it may be obſerved that a cubic foot of oak is equal
                to 66 pounds, and the ſpeciſic gravity of the other materials are as follow :</p>
