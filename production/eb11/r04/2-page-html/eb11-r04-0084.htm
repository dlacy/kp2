<p><span class="font2">Constantine.<sup>@@1</sup> The original building of Vespasian was probably an archive and record office; it was certainly not a temple. The fine&nbsp;bronze doors at the entrance to the temple of Romulus are much&nbsp;earlier than the building itself, as are also the porphyry columns&nbsp;and very rich entablature which ornament this doorway. Pope&nbsp;Felix IV. (526-30) made the double building into the church of&nbsp;SS. Cosmo e Damiano, using the circular domed temple of Romulus&nbsp;as a porch.<sup>@@2 </sup>The chief building oF Vespasian’s forum was the Tern-plum Pacis,<sup>@@3</sup> dedicated in 75, one of the most magnificent in Rome,&nbsp;which contained a very large collection oi works of art.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The forum of Nerva (see fig. 11) occupied the narrow strip left between the fora of Augustus and Vespasian; being little more&nbsp;than a richly decorated street, it was called the Forum&nbsp;Transitorium or Forum Palladium, from the temple to&nbsp;Minerva which it contained. It was begun by Domitian,&nbsp;and dedicated by Nerva in 97 (see Suet. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Dom.</span><span class="font2"> 5; Mart. i. 2, 8).&nbsp;Like the other imperial fora, it was surrounded by a peperino wall,&nbsp;not only lined with marble but also decorated with rows of Corinthian&nbsp;columns supporting a rich entablature with sculptured frieze. Two&nbsp;columns and part of this wall still exist; on the frieze are reliefs of&nbsp;weaving, fulling and various arts which were under the protection oi&nbsp;Minerva.. A great part of the temple existed till the time of Paul&nbsp;V., who in 1606 destroyed it to use the remains for the building of&nbsp;the Acqua Paola.<sup>@@4</sup> In the reign oF Severus Alexander a series of&nbsp;colossal bronze statues, some equestrian, were set round this forum;&nbsp;they represented all the previous emperors who had been deified,&nbsp;and by each was a bronze column inscribed with his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">res gestae</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Hist. Aug.; Sev. Alex.</span><span class="font2"> 28).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The forum of Trajan with its adjacent buildings was the last and, at least in size, the most magnificent of all; it was in progress from&nbsp;113 to 117, at least. A great.spur of hill, which connected&nbsp;the Capitoline with the Quirinal, was cut away to make a&nbsp;level site for this enormous group of buildings, ft consisted (see fig. 11). of a large dipteral peristyle, with curved&nbsp;projections,.lined with shops on the side. That against the slope&nbsp;of the Quirinal, three storeys high, still partly exists. The main&nbsp;entrance was through a. triumphal arch (Dio Cass, lxviii. 20).&nbsp;Aurei.of Trajan show this arch and other parts of his forum.<sup>@@5</sup> The&nbsp;opposite side was occupied by the Basilica Ulpia (Jordan, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">F.U.R.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">iii. 25, 26), part of which, with the column of Trajan, is now visible;&nbsp;none of the columns, which arc of grey granite, are </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in situ,</span><span class="font2"> and&nbsp;the whole restoration is misleading. Part of the rich paving in&nbsp;oriental marble is genuine. This basilica contained two large</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">libraries (Dio Cass, lxviii. 16; Aul. Gell. xi. 17).</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">The Columna Cochlis (so cahed lrom its spiral stairs) is, including-c^pital and base, 97 ft 9 in. high,<sup>@@6</sup> </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font2"> 100 Roman ft.; its pedestal has reliefs of trophies of Dacian arms, and winged Victories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the shaft are reliefs arranged spirally, in twenty-three tiers scenes of Trajan’s victories, containing about 2500&nbsp;figures. Trajan’s ashes were buried in a gold urn under this column&nbsp;(Dio Cass, lxviii. 16); and on the summit was a colossal gilt&nbsp;bronze statue of the emperor, now replaced by a poor figure of&nbsp;St Peter, set there by Sixtus V.<sup>@@7</sup> Beyond the column stood the&nbsp;temple of Trajan completed by Hadrian; its foundations exist&nbsp;under the buildings at the north-east side of the modern&nbsp;piazza, and many of its granite columns have been found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This temple is shown on coins of Hadrian.<sup>@@8</sup>The architect of this magnificent group of buildings was Apollodorus of Damascus&nbsp;(Dio Cass. lxix. 4), who also designed many buildings in Rome&nbsp;during Hadrian’s reign.<sup>@@9</sup> In addition to the five imperial fora,,&nbsp;and the Forum Magnum, Holitorium and Boarium, mentioned&nbsp;above, there were also smaller markets for pigs (Forum Suariu.m)^&nbsp;bread (Forum Pistorium) and fish (Forum Piscarium), all of which,&nbsp;with some others, popularly but wrongly called fora, are given in the&nbsp;regionary catalogues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Other Temples, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Besides the temples mentioned in previous sections remains of many others still exist in Rome. The circular temple by the </span><span class="font1">Tiher.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">in the Forum Boarium (Plan, No. 5), formerly thought&nbsp;to be that of Vesta, is possibly that of Portunus, the god&nbsp;of the harbour (Varro, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">L.L.</span><span class="font2"> vi. 19). Its design is similar&nbsp;to that of the temple of Vesta in the forum (fig. 8), and, except the&nbsp;entablature and upper part of the cella, which are gone, it is well</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>@@@3 </sup>Statues by Pheidias and Lysippus existed in the Forum Pacis as late as the 6th century (Procop. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bell. Goth.</span><span class="font2"> iv. 21).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>@@@4 </sup>Drawings of it are given by Du Pdrac and Palladio </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Arch.</span><span class="font2"> iv. 8).</span></p>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>@@@6 </sup>Its pedestal is inscribed, &quot; Senatus Populusque Romanus Imp. Caesari Divi Nervae F. Nervae Trajano Aug. Germ. Dacico Pontif.&nbsp;Maximo Trib. Pot. XVII. [i.e. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font2"> 113] Imp. VI. Cos. VI. P. P. ad'&nbsp;declarandum quantae altitudinis mons et locus tantis operibus sit&nbsp;egestus.” This would seem to indicate the height of the hill removed&nbsp;to form the site, and is so explained by Dion Cass, (lxviii. 16). It&nbsp;is impossible that the saddle connecting the Quirinal with the&nbsp;Capitoline hill can have been 100 ft. in height (Brocchi, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Suolo di&nbsp;Roma,</span><span class="font2"> p. 133), but it may be that the cliff of the Quirinal was cut&nbsp;back to a slope reaching to a point about 72 ft. high; thus the statement oi the inscription is much exaggerated. Comm. Boni has&nbsp;found the remains of a road beneath the pavement of the Forum,&nbsp;near the column, and believes that the inscription refers to the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">height</span><span class="font2"> of the. buildings.
