<p><span class="font1">trine of Scripture ; but how far his reafons can be here juſtiſied we mean not to determine ; we ihall leave&nbsp;that to be fettled by others, reminding them only that&nbsp;the diſtance of future rewards and puniſhments is not&nbsp;greater on the ſhppoſition oſ the ſleep of the ſoul than&nbsp;on the contrary hypotheſis. Every man who has but&nbsp;dipt into the ſcience of metaphyſics knows, and no man&nbsp;ever knew better than he who is believed to have been&nbsp;the author of the work before us, that time unperceived paffes away as in an inſtant; and that if the ſoul&nbsp;be in a ſtate void of conſciohſneſs between death and&nbsp;the reſurrection, the man who has lain in his grave&nbsp;iooo years will appear to himſelf to have died in one&nbsp;moment and been raifed in the next, we would likewiſe recommend to thoſe who may henceforth be inclined to inculcate any thing as a doctrine of Scripture&nbsp;merely on account of its ſuppoſed expediency, always&nbsp;to remember that God is above, that they are below,&nbsp;that he is omniſcient, that they are of yeſtcrday aud&nbsp;know little, that their words therefore ſhould be wary&nbsp;and few, and that they ſhould always ſpeak with reſpect of whatever concerns the Sovereign of the univerſe,&nbsp;or relates to his government either in the natural or mo∙&nbsp;ral world. For wilt thou, fays the Higheſt, diſannul</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">my judgement? wilt thou condemn me that thou may-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">cſt </span><span class="font1">be righteous ? ſhall he that contendeth with the Al-mighty inſtruct him ? He that reproveth God let him anſwer it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If, in ſtating theſe oppoſite opinions, we may ſeem to have favoured what has been called the ſleep of the&nbsp;ſoul, it is not from any conviction of its truth, for&nbsp;there are particular texts of Scripture which appear to&nbsp;us to militate againſt it. W6 are ſatisſied, however,&nbsp;that it is a very harmlefs opinion, neither injurious to the&nbsp;reſt of the articles of the Chriſtian faith nor to virtuous&nbsp;practice ; and that thoſe who have poured forth torrents of obloquy upon ſuch as may have held it in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, have either miſtaken the&nbsp;doctrine which they condemned, or been poffeffed by&nbsp;a ſpirit leſs mild than that of the gofpel (x).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">whatever be the fate of the middle ſtate, the reſurrection ſtands on a different baſis. It is repeatedly af-ſerted in Scripture; and thoſe grounds on which we believe it are authenticated facts, which the affectation, the ingenuity, and the hatred of ſceptics, have number-leſs times attempted in vain to diſprove. Theſe facts&nbsp;we are now to conſider, referring our readers for the&nbsp;character of the witneffes, the authenticity of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">go·&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">ſpel-hiſtory, and the poſſibility of miracles, to the&nbsp;parts of this work where theſe ſubjects are treated&nbsp;(See Miracle, Metaphysics, Part I. Chap. vii. and&nbsp;Religion) ; or, ſhould more particular information be&nbsp;required, to the writings of Ditton, Sherlock, and well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">o </span><span class="font1">nr Lord, after proving his divine miſſion by the miracles which he wrought, and by the completion of&nbsp;ancient predictions in which he was deſcribed, declared</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vol. XVI. Part I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">that the doctrine of a refurrection was one of thofe truths which he came to announce. To ſhow that ſuch&nbsp;an event was poſſible, he reftored to life the daughter of&nbsp;Jairus, a ruler of the ſynagogue, a young man of Nain,&nbsp;who was carried out on his bier to be buried, and his&nbsp;friend Lazarus, whoſe body at the time was thought to&nbsp;have become the prey of corruption. Though the two&nbsp;ſirſt of thefe miracles were wrought in the preſence of&nbsp;a number of witneſtes, yet the laſt, owing to particular&nbsp;circumſtances, produced a much greater noiſe among&nbsp;the Jews. It was performed on a perfon ſeemingly of&nbsp;ſome note, in the village of Bethany, not far from Jeruſalem, and in the preſence of a great many perſons&nbsp;who from the metropolis had come to condole with</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mary and Martha. No doubts were entertained of the reality of Lazarus’s death, ∩ur Lord was at a diſtance&nbsp;when he expired, and his body had already been lying&nbsp;for ſome days in the grave, when he came forth at&nbsp;the voice of our Lord, all were aſtoniihed. Thoſe from&nbsp;Jeruſalem, on returning home, are impatient to relate&nbsp;what they had ſeen ; thoſe who heard of ſo memorable&nbsp;an event cannot conceal it ; the report reaches the ears&nbsp;of the Phariſees and chief prieſts. They are ſoon made&nbsp;acquainted with every circumſtance ; and dreading the&nbsp;iſtue, they think it neceffary to call a council upon the&nbsp;occaſion, and concert the meaſures that ought to be&nbsp;purſued in a matter which was likely to be attended&nbsp;with ſo many and important conſequenccs. In this&nbsp;council, it feemed to be agreed that our Lord had performed, and was ſtill continuing to perform, many mi-racles : That this laff miracle, as being of an extraordinary kind, would make many converts ; and that if&nbsp;meafnres were not ſpeedily taken to prevent theſe uncommon diſplays of his power, all would believe on&nbsp;him : the jealouſy of the Romans would be excited, the&nbsp;rulers depofed, and the nation of the Jews deprived of&nbsp;its few remaining privileges. Yet, notwithſtanding theſe&nbsp;private conceſſions made in the council, the members&nbsp;who dreaded to let their ſentiments be known to the&nbsp;people, affect in public to treat our Saviour as an im-poftor. But he who already had demonſtrated the abfurdity of their opinion, who ſuppoſed that his miracles&nbsp;were wrought by Beelzebub prince of the devils, is again&nbsp;ready to confute the ridiculous affertion of thoſe who&nbsp;pretended to ſay that they were a deception. His friend&nbsp;Lazarus was ſtill living at the diſtance of only a few&nbsp;miles, and many of the Jews who had gone to ſee him&nbsp;were ready to atteſt the truth of the report. If the&nbsp;rulers, apprehending the conſequences of the truth, be&nbsp;afraid to know it, and if they are unwilling to go to&nbsp;Bethany, or to ſend for Lazarus and thoſe who were&nbsp;preſent at his reſurrection, our Lord gives them a fair&nbsp;opportunity of detecting his fraud, if there was any ſuch&nbsp;to be found in him. 'Γo preſerve their power, and re-move the jealous ſuſpicion of the Romans, it had been&nbsp;already determined in council to put him to death ; and</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">(x) Perhaps no man has been more culpable in this reſpect than the celebrated warburton, who ſeems at ſirſt to have himſelf denied an intermediate ſtate of conſcions exiſtence. He afterwards imagined that luch a&nbsp;ſtate is ſuppoſed, though not expreſsly afferted, in Scripture ; and at laſt he maintained it with all the zeal and&nbsp;warmth of a profelyte. To prove the ſincerſty of his converſion, he treated his adverſaries with ſcurrilous&nbsp;•nicknames, banter, and abuſe ; a ſpecies of reaſoning which ſeldom ſucceeds in recommending a bad cauſe, and&nbsp;f.dιιeh </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">never confers credit </span><span class="font1">on </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font1">that is good.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
