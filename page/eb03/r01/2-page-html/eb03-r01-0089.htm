<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">vil. </span><span class="font5">The confequence of all this was, that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">every </span><span class="font5">one was eager to provide himſelf with theſe ſalutary reme-dies ; conſequently, great numbers undertook fatiguing&nbsp;and perilous voyages, and ſubjected themſelves to all&nbsp;ſorts of hardſhips ; while others made uſe of this delu-fion to accumulate their riches, and to impofe upon the&nbsp;miſerable multitude by the moſt impious and ſhocking&nbsp;inventions. As the demand for relics was prodigious&nbsp;and univerſal, the clergy employed the utmoſt dex-terity to ſatisfy all demands, and were far from being&nbsp;nice in the methods they uſed for that end. The bo-dies of the ſaints were fought by faſting and prayer, in-ſtituted by the prieſt in order to obtain a divine anſwer&nbsp;and an infallible direction, and this pretended direction&nbsp;never failed to accompliſh their deſires ; the holy car-cafe was always found, and that always in conſequence,&nbsp;as they impiouſly gave out, of the ſuggeſtion and infpi-ration of God himſelf. Each difcovery of this kind&nbsp;was attended with exceffive demonſtrations of joy, and&nbsp;animated the zeal of thefe devout feekers to enrich the&nbsp;church ſtill more and more with this new kind of trea-ſure. Many travelled with this view into the Eaſtern&nbsp;provinces, and frequented the places which Chriſt and&nbsp;his diſciples had honoured with their preſence, that,&nbsp;with the bones and other ſacred remains of the firſt he-ralds of the goſpel, they might comfort dejected minds,&nbsp;■calm trembling confciences, fave finking ſtates, and de-fend their inhabitants from all forts of calamities. Nor&nbsp;did thefe pious travellers return home empty ; the craft,&nbsp;dexterity, and knavery of the Greeks, found a rich&nbsp;prey in the ſtupid credulity of the Latin relic-hunters,&nbsp;and made a profitable commerce of this new devotion.&nbsp;The latter paid conſiderable ſums for legs and arms,&nbsp;ikulls and jaw-bones (ſeveral of which were Pagan,&nbsp;and ſome not human), and other things that were&nbsp;ſuppoſed to have belonged to the primitive worthies&nbsp;of the Chriſtian church ; and thus the Latin churches&nbsp;came to the poſſeſſion of thoſe celebrated relics of&nbsp;St Mark, St James, St Bartholomew, Cyprian, Pan-taleon, and other?, which they ſhow at this day with&nbsp;fo much oſtentation. But there were many who, un-able to procure for themſelves theſe ſpiritual treaſures&nbsp;by voyages and prayers, had recourſe to violence and&nbsp;theft ; for all ſorts of means, and all forts of attempts in&nbsp;a cauſe of this nature, were conſidered, when fucceſs-ful, as pious and acceptable to the Supreme Being.—&nbsp;Beſides the arguments from antiquity to which the Pa-piſts refer, in vindication of their worſhip of relics, of&nbsp;which the reader may form ſome judgment from this&nbsp;article, Bellarmine appeals to Scripture in ſupport of&nbsp;it, and cites the following paſſages, viz. Exod. xiii. 19. ;&nbsp;Deut. xxxiv. 6. ; 2 Kings xiii. 21. ; 2 Kings xxiii. 16,&nbsp;17, 18.; Iſaiah xi. 10. ; Matthewxi. 20, 21, 22. ; Acts&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">v. </span><span class="font5">12- 15. ; Acts xix. ii, 12. See Popery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Roman Catholics in Great Britain do not ac-knowledge any worſhip to be due to relics, but merely </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">high veneration and reſpe i, by which means they&nbsp;think they honour God, who, they ſay, has often&nbsp;wrought very extraordinary miracles by them. But,&nbsp;however proper this veneration and reſpect may be, its&nbsp;abuſe has been </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ſo </span><span class="font5">great and ſo general, as fully to war-rant the rejection of them altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Relics are forbidden to be uſed or brought into England by ſeveral ſtatutes ; and juſtices oſ peace are empowered to ſearch houles for popiſh books and relics,</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">RELICT, in law, the fame with Widow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">RELIEF </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Relevamen ;</span><span class="font5"> but, in Domefday, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Relevαtio, Relevium},</span><span class="font5"> ſignifies a certain ſum of money, which the&nbsp;tenant, holding by knight’s ſervice, grand ſerjeanty, or&nbsp;other tenure, (for which homage or legal ſervice is&nbsp;due), and being at full age at the death of his an-ceſtor, paid unto his lord at his entrance. See Pri-mer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Though reliefs had their original while feuds were only life-eſtates, yet they continued after feuds became hereditary; and were therefore looked upon,&nbsp;very juſtly, as one of the greateſt grievances of tenure : eſpecially when, at the firſt, they were merely&nbsp;arbitrary and at the will of the lord ; ſo that, if he&nbsp;pleaſed to demand an exorbitant relief, it was in effect&nbsp;to diſinherit the heir. The Engliih ill brooked this&nbsp;conſequence of their new-adopted policy; and there-fore william the Conqueror by his laws </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">afcertained</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;relief, by directing (in imitation of the Daniſh he-riots), that a certain quantity of arms, and habiliments of war, ſhonld be paid by the earls, barons, and&nbsp;vavaſours refpectively ; and, if the latter had no arms,&nbsp;they ſhould pay 100s. william Rufus broke through&nbsp;this compoſition, and again demanded arbitrary un-certain reliefs, as due by the feodal laws ; thereby in&nbsp;effect obliging every heir to new-purchaſe or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">redeem&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">his land: but his brother Henry I. by the charter be-fore-mentioned, reſtored his father’s law ; and ordained,&nbsp;that the relief to be paid ſhould be according to the&nbsp;law ſo eſtabliſhed, and not an arbitrary redemption.—■&nbsp;But afterwards, when, by an ordinance in 27 Hen. II.&nbsp;called the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">afiſe oſ arms,</span><span class="font5"> it was provided, that every&nbsp;man’s armour ſhould deſcend to his heir, for defence&nbsp;of the realm, and it thereby became impracticable to&nbsp;pay theſe acknowledgments in arms according to the&nbsp;laws of the Conqueror,<sup>1</sup> the compoſition was univer-fally accepted of 100 s. for every knight’s fee, as ws&nbsp;find it ever after eſtabliſhed. But it muſt be remem-bered, that this relief was only then payable, if the&nbsp;heir at the death of his anceſtor had attained his full&nbsp;age of 21 years.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">To Relieve the Trenches,</span><span class="font5"> is to relieve the guard of the trenches, by appointing thoſe for that duty who&nbsp;have been there before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">To Relieve the Sentries,</span><span class="font5"> is to put freſh men upon that duty from the guard, which is generally done&nbsp;every two hours, by a corporal who attends the relief,&nbsp;to ſee that the proper orders are delivered to the ſoldier&nbsp;who relieves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">RELIEVO, or Relief, in ſculpture, &amp;c. is the projecture or ſtanding out of a figure which ariſes prominent from the ground or plane on which it is formed;&nbsp;whether that figure be cut with the chiſſel, moulded, or&nbsp;caſt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are three kinds or degrees of relievo, viz. alto, baſſo, and demi-relievo.
