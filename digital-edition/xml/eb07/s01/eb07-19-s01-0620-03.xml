 a French writer of uncommon abilities and erudition, descended from an ancient and noble family, and born at or near Samur in the year 1596. His mother, who was a Protestant, infused her notions of religion into him, and he at length converted his father. He settled at Leyden ; and in 1650 he paid a visit to Christina queen of Sweden, who is reported to have shown him ex</p><p>traordinary marks of regard. Upon the violent death of Charles I. of England, he was prevailed on by the royal family, then in exile, to write a defence of that king ; which was answered by our Milton in 1651, in a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Defensio pro Populo Anglicano contra Claudii Salmasii Defensionem Pegiam.</hi> This book was read over all Europe, and conveyed such a proof of the writer’s abilities, that he was respected even by those who hated his principles. Salmasius died in 1653 ; and some did not scruple to say that Milton killed him by the acuteness of his reply. His works are numerous, and of various kinds; but the greatest monuments of his learning are, his <hi rend="italic">Notœ in Historice Augustae Scriptores,</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Exercitationes Pliniana: in Salinum.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
