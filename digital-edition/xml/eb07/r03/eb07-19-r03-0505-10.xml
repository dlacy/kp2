<p><label>ROUBAIX</label>
a large market-town of France, in the department of the North, and the arrondissement of Lisle. It is a place of extensive manufactories, formerly of woollens, but of late years almost exclusively of cottons. There are several mills for spinning; and a great quantity of quiltings, dimities, nankeens, and other cotton articles, are made, and of good quality. The town, in 1836, contained 18,187 inhabitants.</p>
