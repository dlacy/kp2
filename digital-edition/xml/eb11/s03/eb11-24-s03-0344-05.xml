S. from Hirschberg. From the crest, which is about 50 yds. sq. and across which runs the frontier line between Silesia and Bohemia, a magnificent view is obtained across the Oder plain to Breslau on the north and over Bohemia to the south-west. Just below the ridge, on the Prussian side, lies the chapel of St Lawrence, which was used as a hospice for travellers from 1824 to 1850, when a new hostel was erected. Since 1900 a meteorological station has been established here.</p><p>See Zetzmann, <hi rend="italic">Panorama von der Schneekoppe</hi> (Berlin, 1903).</p></div></body></text></TEI>
