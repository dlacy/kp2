                <p><label>ST EUSTATIUS and SABA</label>, two islands in the Dutch West Indies. St
                    Eustatius lies 12 m. N.W. of St Kitts in 17° 50' N. and 62° 40' W. It is 8 sq.
                    m. in area and is composed of several volcanic hills and intervening valleys. It
                    contains Orangetown, situated on an open roadstead on the W., with a small
                    export trade in yams and sweet potatoes. Pop. (1908) 1283.</p>
                <p>A few miles to the N.W. is the island of Saba, 5 sq. m. in extent. It consists of
                    a single volcanic cone rising abruptly from the sea to the height of nearly 2800
                    ft. The town, Bottom, standing on the floor of an old crater, can only be
                    approached from the shore 800 ft. below, by a series of steps cut in the solid
                    rock and known as the “ Ladder.” The best boats in the Caribbees are built here;
                    the wood is imported and the vessels, when complete, are lowered over the face
                    of the cliffs. Pop. (1908) 2294. The islands form part of the colony of Curaçao
