                <p><label>ROSA, SALVATOR</label> (1615-1673), Italian painter of the Neapolitan
                    school, was born in Arenella, in the outskirts of Naples, in 1615: the precise
                    day is given as the 20th of June, and also as the 21st of July. His father, Vito
                    Antonio de Rosa, a land surveyor, was bent upon making the youth a lawyer, or
                    else a priest, and sent him to study in the convent of the Somaschi fathers.
                    Here Salvator began showing a turn for art: he w <hi rend="sup">r</hi> ent in
                    secret to his maternal uncle Paolo Greco to learn the practice of painting, but
                    soon found that Greco had little pictorial lore to impart, so he transferred
                    himself to his own brother-in-law Francesco Fracanzaro, a pupil of Ribera, and
                    afterwards had some practice under Ribera himself. Above all he went to nature,
                    frequenting the Neapolitan coast, and keeping his eyes open and his hand busy.
                    At the age of seventeen he lost his father; the widow was
                    left unprovided for, with at least five children, and Salvator found himself
                    immersed in a sea of troubles and perplexities, with nothing for the while to
                    stem them except a buoyant and adventurous temperament. He obtained some
                    instruction under the battle-painter Aniello Falcone, but chiefly painted in
                    solitude, haunting romantic</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0721" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0774.jp2"/>
               <p>and desolate spots, beaches, mountains, caverns, verdure-clad recesses. Hence he
                    became in process of time the initiator of romantic landscape, with a special
                    turn for scenes of strange or picturesque aspect—often turbulent and rugged, at
                    times grand, and with suggestions of the sublime. He picked up scanty doles when
                    he could get them, and his early landscapes sold for a few pence to petty
                    dealers. The first person to discover that Rosa’s work was not as trumpery as it
                    was cheap was the painter Lanfranco, who bought some of the paintings, and
                    advised the youth to go to Rome. Hither in 1635, at the age of twenty, Rosa
                    betook himself; he studied with enthusiasm, but, catching fever, he returned to
                    Naples and Falcone, and for a while painted nothing but battlepieces, and these
                    without exciting any attention. This class of work was succeeded by the
                    landscape art peculiarly characteristic of him—wild scenes wildly peopled with
                    shepherds, seamen or especially soldiers. He then revisited Rome, and was housed
                    by Cardinal Bran-caccio; this prelate being made bishop of Viterbo, Rosa painted
                    for the Chiesa della Morte a large and noticeable picture of the “ Incredulity
                    of Thomas ”—the first work of sacred art which we find recorded from his hand.
                    At Viterbo he made acquaintance with a mediocre poet named ‘Abati, and was hence
                    incited to try his own faculty in verse. He then returned to Naples. Here the
                    monopolizing triumvirate—Ribera, Caracciolo and Corenzio —were still powerful.
                    Rosa was as yet too obscure to suffer from their machinations; but, having
                    painted a picture of “ Tityus Torn by the Vulture,” which went to Rome and there
                    produced a great sensation, he found it politic to follow in the footsteps of
                    his fame, and once more, in 1638, resought the papal city.</p>
               <p>Rosa was a man of facile and versatile genius, and had by this time several
                    strings to his bow. It is said that, still keeping painting steadily in view as
                    his real objective, he resolved to secure attention first as a musician, poet,
                    improvisatore and actor—his mother-wit and broad Neapolitan dialect (which
                    appears to have stuck to him through life) standing him powerfully in stead. In
                    the carnival he masqued as Formica and Capitan Coviello, and bustled about Rome
                    distributing satirical prescriptions for diseases of the body and more
                    particularly of the mind. As Formica he inveighed against the farcical comedies
                    acted in the Trastevere under the direction of the celebrated Bernini. Some of
                    the actors, in one of their performances, retaliated by insulting Rosa, but the
                    public was with him, and he now enjoyed every form of success—social prestige,
                    abundant commissions and any amount of money, which he was wont to throw about
                    broadcast to the populace. In 1646 he returned to Naples, and is said to have
                    taken an active part in the insurrection of Masaniello; certain it is that he
                    sympathized with and admired the fisherman autocrat, for a passage in one of his
                    satires proves this. His actual share in the insurrection is, however, dubious;
                    it appears only in recent narratives, and the same is the case with the
                    well-known story that at one time he herded with a band of brigands in the
                    Abruzzi—an incident which cannot be conveniently dove-tailed into any of the
                    known dates of his career. As regards the popular revolt against Spanish
                    tyranny, it is alleged that Rosa, along with other painters—Coppola, Porpora,
                    Domenico Gar-giuolo, Dal Po, Masturzo, the two Vaccari and Cadogna—all under the
                    captaincy of Aniello Falcone, formed the <hi rend="italic">Compagnia della
                        Morte&gt;</hi> whose mission it was to hunt up Spaniards in the streets
                    and despatch them, not sparing even those who had sought some place of religious
                    asylum. He painted a portrait of Masaniello—probably from reminiscence rather
                    than from life: indeed, it is said that he painted him several times over in
                    less than life size. On the approach of Don John of Austria the blood-stained
                        <hi rend="italic">Compagnia</hi> dispersed, Rosa escaping or at any rate
                    returning to Rome. Here he painted some important subjects, showing the uncommon
                    bent of his mind as it passed from landscape into history—“ Democritus amid
                    Tombs,” the “ Death of Socrates,” “ Regulus in the Spiked Cask ” (these two are
                    now in England), “Justice Quitting the Earth,” and the “ Wheel of Fortune.” This
                    last work, the tendency of which was bitingly satirical,
                    raised a storm of ire and remonstrance.</p>
               <p>Rosa, endeavouring at conciliation, published a description of its meaning
                    (probably softened down not a little from the real facts); none the less an
                    order for his imprisonment was issued, but ultimately withheld at the instance
                    of some powerful friends. It was about this time that Rosa wrote his satire
                    named <hi rend="italic">Babylon,</hi> under which name Rome was of course
                    indicated.</p>
               <p>Cardinal Giancarlo de’ Medici now invited the painter to leave Rome—which had
                    indeed become too hot to hold him— for Florence. Salvator gladly assented, and
                    remained in the Tuscan capital for the better part of nine years, introducing
                    there the new style of landscape; he had no pupils, but various imitators.
                    Lorenzo Lippi the painter poet, and other <hi rend="italic">beaux esprits</hi>
                    shared with Rosa the hospitalities of the cardinal, and they formed an academy
                    named <hi rend="italic">I Percossi</hi> (the Stricken), indulging in a deal of
                    ingenious jollity—Rosa being alike applauded as painter, poet and musician. His
                    chief intimate at this time was Lippi, whom he encouraged to proceed with the
                    poem <hi rend="italic">II Malmantile Racquistato.</hi> He was well acquainted
                    also with Ugo and Giulio Maffei, and housed with them more than once in
                    Volterra, where he wrote other four satires— <hi rend="italic">Music, Poetry,
                        Painting</hi> and <hi rend="italic">War.</hi> About the same time he painted
                    his own portrait, now in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence. Finally he reverted
                    once more to Rome, and hardly left that city again. Much enmity still brooded
                    there against him, taking the form more especially of an allegation that the
                    satires which he zealously read and diffused in MS. were not his own production,
                    but filched from some one else. Rosa indignantly repelled this charge, which
                    remains indeed quite unsubstantiated, although it is true that the satires deal
                    so extensively and with such ready manipulation in classical names, allusions
                    and anecdotes, that one is rather at a loss to fix upon the period of his busy
                    career at which Rosa could possibly have imbued his mind with such a multitude
                    of semi-erudite details. It may perhaps be legitimate to suppose that his
                    literary friends in Florence and Volterra had coached him up to a large extent—
                    the satires, as compositions, remaining none the less strictly and fully his
                    own. To confute his detractors he now wrote the last of the series, entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">Envy.</hi> Among the pictures of his closing years were the
                    admired “ Battlepiece ” now in the Louvre, painted in the short space of forty
                    days, full of long-drawn carnage, with ships burning in the offing; “ Pythagoras
                    and the Fishermen;” the “Oath of Catiline” (Pitti Gallery); and the very
                    celebrated “ Saul and the Witch of Endor ” (Louvre), which is almost his latest
                    work. He undertook a series of satirical portraits, to be closed by one of
                    himself; but while occupied with this project he was assailed by dropsy, which,
                    after lasting fully half a year, brought his life to a close on the 15th of
                    March 1673. In his last moments he married a Florentine named Lucrezia, who kept
                    his house and had borne him two sons, one of them surviving him, and he died in
                    a contrite frame of mind. He lies buried in the Chiesa degli Angeli, where a
                    portrait of him has been set up. Salvator Rosa, after the hard struggles of his
                    early youth, had always been a successful man, and he left a handsome fortune.</p>
               <p>Rosa was indisputably a great leader in that modern tendency of fine art towards
                    the romantic and picturesque which, developing in various directions and by
                    diversified processes, has at last almost totally differentiated modern from
                    olden art. He saw appearances with a new eye, and presented new images of them
                    on his canvases, and deserves therefore all the credit due to a vigorous
                    innovator, even if we contest the absolute value of his product. He himself
                    courted reputation for his historical works, laying comparatively little stress
                    on his. landscapes; in portraits he was forcible. In chiaroscuro he is simple
                    and effective; his design has energy and a certain grandeur, without any high
                    type of form or any superior measure of correctness. His colour is too
                    constantly of a sandy or yellowish-grey tone. Personally he was a man of high
                    spirit, and he sold his pictures at large prices, more (it is said) to assert
                    the honour of his art than from love of money; rather than sell them cheap he
                    destroyed them. In his later Florentine period he etched several of his works,
                    subjects of mythology, soldiering, &amp;c. He was choleric, but kind and
                    generous. Though a man of gaiety and pleasure, and a jovial boon companion, he
                    does not appear to have been vicious in any serious degree. He was.talkative,
                    very sharp-tongued and an unblushing encomiast of his own performances. Among
                    his pictures not already mentioned we may name, in the National</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0722" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0775.jp2"/>
               <p>Gallery, London, “Mercury and the Dishonest Woodman,” and
                    three others; in Raynham Hall, “ Belisarius ”; in the Grosvenor Gallery, “
                    Diogenes <hi rend="sup">6</hi> ; in the Pitti Gallery, a grand portrait of a man
                    in armour, and the “ Temptation of St Anthony, which contains his own portrait.
                    This last subject appears also in St Petersburg, and in the Berlin Gallery.</p>
               <p>The satires of Salvator Rosa deserve more attention than they have generally
                    received. There are, however, two recent books taking account of them—by
                    Cesáreo, 1892, and Cartelli, 1899. The satires, though considerably spread
                    abroad during his lifetime, were not published until 1719. They are all in terza
                    rima, written without much literary correctness, but remarkably spirited,
                    pointed and even brilliant. They are slashingly denunciatory, and from this
                    point of view too monotonous in treatment. Rosa here appears as a very severe
                    castigator of all ranks and conditions of men, not sparing the highest, and as a
                    champion of the poor and down-trodden, and of moral virtue and Catholic faith.
                    It seems odd that a man who took so free a part in the pleasures and diversions
                    of life should be so ruthless to the ministers of these. The satire on <hi
                        rend="italic">Music</hi> exposes the insolence and profligacy of musicians,
                    and the shame of courts and churches in encouraging them. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Poetry</hi> dwells</p>
               <p>on the pedantry, imitativencss, adulation, affectation</p>
               <p>and indecency of poets—also their poverty, and the</p>
               <p>neglect with which they, were treated; and there is a</p>
               <p>very vigorous sortie against oppressive governors and</p>
               <p>aristocrats. Tasso’s glory is upheld; Dante is spoken</p>
               <p>of as obsolete, and Ariosto , as corrupting. <hi rend="italic">Painting</hi>
               </p>
               <p>inveighs against the pictorial treatment of squalid</p>
               <p>subjects, such as beggars (though .Rosa must surely</p>
               <p>himself have been partly responsible for this mis</p>
               <p>direction of the art), against the ignorance and lewd</p>
               <p>ness of painters, and their tricks of trade, and the</p>
               <p>gross indecorum of painting sprawling half-naked</p>
               <p>saints of both sexes. <hi rend="italic">War</hi> (which contains the</p>
               <p>eulogy of Masaniello) derides the folly of hireling</p>
               <p>soldiers, who fight and perish while kings stay at</p>
               <p>home; the vile morals of kings and lords, heresy and</p>
               <p>unbelief also come in for a flagellation. In <hi rend="italic">Babylon</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Rosa represents himself as a fisherman, Tirreno, con</p>
               <p>stantly unlucky in his net-hauls on the Euphrates;</p>
               <p>he converses with a native of the country, Ergasto. Babylon (Rome) is very
                    severely treated, and Naples much the same. <hi rend="italic">Envy</hi> (the
                    last of the satires, and generally accounted the best, although without strong
                    apparent reason) represents Rosa dreaming that, as he is about to inscribe in
                    all modesty his name upon the threshold of the temple of glory, the goddess or
                    fiend of Envy obstructs him, and a long interchange of reciprocal, objurgations
                    ensues. Here occurs the highly charged portrait of the chief Roman detractor of
                    Salvator (we are not aware that he has ever been identified by name); and the
                    painter protests that he would never condescend to do any of the lascivious work
                    in painting so shamefully in vogue.</p>
               <p>As authorities for the life of Salvator Rosa, Passeri, <hi rend="italic">Vite
                        de' Pittori,</hi> may be consulted, and Salvini, <hi rend="italic">Satire e
                        Vita di Salvator Rosa;</hi> also Baldinucci and Dominici. The <hi
                        rend="italic">Life</hi> by Lady Morgan is a romantic treatment, mingling
                    tradition or mere fiction with fact. The novel, <hi rend="italic">A Company of
                        Death,</hi> by Albert Cotton, 1904, gives an interesting picture of Salvator
                    Rosa at Naples. (W. M. R.)</p>
