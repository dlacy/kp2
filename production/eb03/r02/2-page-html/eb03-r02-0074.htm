<body><a name="caption1"></a><h3><span class="font2">HL of the water is lower, or at </span><span class="font0">leaſt not higher, than F.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">If the water could be ſupported at the height BF, BF might be conſidered as an orifice in the ſide of a&nbsp;veſſel. In which caſe, the diſcharge Would be the ſame&nbsp;as if the whole water were flowing with the velocity&nbsp;acquired from the height -~ BF, or <sub>τ</sub>* </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h.</span><span class="font0"> And if we ſuppoſe that there is no contraction at the orifice, the&nbsp;mean velocity would be 5/2 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g⅜ <sup>h</sup>&gt; — Vqq2γhD<sup>n</sup></span><span class="font0"> Engliſh inches per ſecond. The area of this orifice is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">I h*&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Therefore the diſcharge would be </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lh VqfiDſh,</span><span class="font0"> all being meaſured in inches. This is the uſual theory ; but&nbsp;it is not an exact repreſentation of the manner in which&nbsp;the efflux really happens. The water cannot remain&nbsp;at the height BF ; but in drawing towards the waſteboard from all ſides, it forms a convex ſurface AlH,&nbsp;ſo that the point I, where the vertical drawn from the&nbsp;edge of the waſteboard meets the curve, is conſiderably&nbsp;lower than B. But as all the mafε above F is ſuppoſed perfectly fluid, the preſſure of the incumbent water&nbsp;is propagated, in the opinion of Mr de Buat, to the&nbsp;filament paſſing over at F without any diminution.&nbsp;The ſame may be ſaid of any filament between F and I*&nbsp;Each tends, therefore, to move ill the ſame manner as&nbsp;if it were really impelled through an orifice in Its place.&nbsp;Therefore the motions through every part of the line&nbsp;or plane IF are the ſame as if the water were eſcaping&nbsp;through an orifice IF, made by a ſluice let down on&nbsp;the water, and keeping up the water of the reſervoir&nbsp;to the level AB. It is beyond a doubt (ſays he) that</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the height IF muſt depend on the whole height BF, and that there muſt be a certain determined proportion&nbsp;between them, tie does not attempt to determine this&nbsp;proportion theoretically, but ſays, that his experiments&nbsp;aſeertain it with great preciſion to be the proportion of&nbsp;one to two, or that IF is always orte-half of BF. He&nbsp;ſays, however, that this determination was not by an&nbsp;immediate and direct meaſetrement ; he concluded it&nbsp;from the compariſon of the quantities of water dif-charged under different heights of the water in the reſervoir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We -Cannot help thinking that this reaſoning is very defective in ſeveral particulars. It cannot be inferred,&nbsp;from the laws of hydroſtatical preſſure, that the filament at I is preſſed forward with all the weight of the&nbsp;column BI. The particle I is really at the ſurface; and&nbsp;conſidering it as making part of the ſurface of a running ſtream, it is ſubjected to hardly any preſſure, any&nbsp;mote than the particles on the ſurface of a cup of water held in the hand, while it is carried round the&nbsp;axis of the earth and round the ſun·. Reaſoning according to his own principles, and availing himſelf of&nbsp;his own diſeovery, he ſhould ſay, that the particle at I&nbsp;has an accelerating force depending on its ſlope only $&nbsp;and then he ſhould have endeavoured to aſeertain this&nbsp;ſlope. The motion of the particle at I has no immediate connection with the preſſure of the column BI 3&nbsp;and if it had, the motion would be extremely different&nbsp;from what it is : for this preſſure alone would give it&nbsp;the velocity which Mr Buat aſſigns it. Now it is already paſſing through the point I with the velocity&nbsp;which it has acquired in deſcending along the curve&nbsp;AI ; and this is the real ſtate of the caſe. The&nbsp;particles are paſſing through with a velocity already acquired by a hoping current} and they are accelerated</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">by the hydroſtatical preſſure of the water above them. The internal mechaniſm of theſe motions is infinitely&nbsp;more complex than Mr Buat here ſuppoſes; and on this&nbsp;ſuppoſition, he very nearly abandons the theory which&nbsp;he has ſo ſhgeniouſly eſtabliſhed, and adopts the theory of Gnglſelmini which he had exploded. At the&nbsp;ſame time, we think that he is not much miſtaken when&nbsp;he aſſerts, that the motions are nearly the ſame as if a&nbsp;ſluice had been let down from the ſurface to I. For the&nbsp;filament which paſſes at I has been gliding down a cur»&nbsp;ved ſurface, and has not been expoſed to any friction.&nbsp;It is perhaps the very caſe of hydraulics, where the&nbsp;obſtructions are the ſmalleſt ; and we ſhould therefore&nbsp;expect that its motion will be the leaſt retarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have therefore no heſitation in ſaying,that the filament at I is in the very ſtate of motion which the theory would aſſign to it if it were paſſing under a ſluice, as Mr Buat ſuppoſes. And with reſpect to the inferior&nbsp;filaments, without attempting the very difficult talk of&nbsp;inveſtigating their motions, we ſhall juſt ſay, that we do&nbsp;not ſee any reaſon for ſuppoſing that they will move&nbsp;flower than our author ſuppoſes. Therefore, though&nbsp;we reject his theory, we admit his experimental propo-fition in general ; that is, we admit that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">whole</span><span class="font0"> water which paſſes through the plane IF moves with the&nbsp;velocity (though notin the ſame direction) with which&nbsp;it would have run through a ſluice of the ſame depth ;&nbsp;and we may proceed with his determination of the&nbsp;quantity of water diſeharged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If we make BC the axis of a parabola BEGH, the velocities of the filaments palling at I and F will be repreſented by the ordinates IE and FG, and the diſcharge by the area IEGF. This allows a very neat&nbsp;ſolution of the problem. Let the quantity diſeharged&nbsp;per ſecond be D, and let the whole height BF be A&nbsp;Let 2 G be the quantity by which we muſt divide the&nbsp;ſquare of the mean velocity, in order to have the producing height. This will be leſs than 2y, the acceleration of gravity, on account of the convergency at the&nbsp;fides and the tendency to convergence at the lip F.&nbsp;We formerly gave for its meaſure 726 inches, inſtead of&nbsp;772, and ſaid that the inches diſeharged per ſecond&nbsp;from an orifice of one inch were 26,49, inſtead of&nbsp;27,78. Let </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">x</span><span class="font0"> be the diſtance of any filament from the&nbsp;horizontal line AB. An element of the orifice, therefore, (for we may give it this name) is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">l x.</span><span class="font0"> The velocity of this element is y∕ <sub>2</sub> </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Qſ, or</span><span class="font0"> √<sup>,</sup> <sub>2</sub> G × </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">V<sup>x</sup>∙</span><span class="font0"> The</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">To determine the conſtant quantity C, obſerve that Mr de Buat found by experiment that BI was in all caſee&nbsp;4 BF.
