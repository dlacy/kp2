        <p><span class="font1">on by his kinsman Hasdrubal (228-221), was completed by his son
                Hannibal, who, with all his father’s genius, inherited&nbsp;also his father’s hatred
                of Rome, and by 219 the authority&nbsp;of Carthage had been extended as far as the
                Ebro. Rome&nbsp;had not watched this rapid advance without anxiety,
                but,&nbsp;probably owing to her troubles with the Celts, she had&nbsp;contented
                herself with stipulating (226) that Carthage&nbsp;should not carry her arms beyond
                the Ebro, so as to&nbsp;threaten Rome’s ancient ally, the Greek Massilia, and
                with&nbsp;securing the independence of the two nominally Greek&nbsp;communities,
                Emporiæ and Saguntum,@@<sup>1</sup> on the east coast.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">But these precautions were of no avail against the resolute
                determination of Hannibal, with whom the&nbsp;conquest of Spain was only preliminary
                to an attack upon&nbsp;Italy, and who could not afford to leave behind him
                in&nbsp;Spain a state allied to Rome. In 219, therefore, disregarding the protests
                of a Roman embassy, he attacked&nbsp;and took Saguntum, an act which, as he had
                foreseen,&nbsp;rendered a rupture with Rome inevitable, while it set his&nbsp;own
                hands free for a further advance.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">A second war with Carthage was no unlooked-for event at Rome; but the
                senate seems to have confidently expected&nbsp;that it would be waged at a distance
                from Italy—in Africa&nbsp;and in Spain, where Saguntum would have given them
                a&nbsp;convenient point of support; and to this hope they clung&nbsp;even after
                Saguntum was lost. In 218, the first year of&nbsp;the war, one consul, P. Cornelius
                Scipio, was despatched to&nbsp;Spain, and the other, T. Sempronius Gracchus, to
                Sicily,&nbsp;and thence to Africa. But Hannibal’s secrecy and promptitude baffled
                all their calculations. Leaving New Carthage&nbsp;early in 218, in the space of five
                months he crossed the&nbsp;Pyrenees, reached the Rhone just as Scipio arrived
                at&nbsp;Massilia on his way to Spain, passed the Alps in spite of&nbsp;endless
                difficulties and hardships, and startled Italy by descending into the plains of
                Cisalpine Gaul. In two battles&nbsp;on the Ticinus and the Trebia he defeated the
                forces hastily&nbsp;collected to bar his progress southwards ; the Celtic
                tribes&nbsp;rallied to his standard ; and at the beginning of the next&nbsp;year he
                prepared to realize the dream of his life and carry&nbsp;fire and sword into Italy
                itself. His own force numbered&nbsp;26,000 men ; the total available strength of
                Rome and her&nbsp;allies was estimated at over 700,OOO.@@<sup>2</sup> But
                Hannibal’s&nbsp;hope lay in the possibility that by the rapidity of
                his&nbsp;movements he might be able to strike a decisive blow&nbsp;before Rome could
                mobilize her levies, or get her somewhat&nbsp;cumbrous military machinery into
                working order. From&nbsp;a first success he expected no less a result than
                the&nbsp;break up of the Roman confederacy, and the isolation of&nbsp;Rome herself,
                while it would also increase the readiness of&nbsp;his own government to render him
                effective support. His&nbsp;trust in himself and his army was not misplaced, for to
                the&nbsp;last he had the advantage over the Roman legions wherever&nbsp;he met them
                in person. Except, however, in South Italy,&nbsp;his brilliant victories and dashing
                marches brought him&nbsp;no allies, and it was his inability to shake the loyalty
                of&nbsp;northern and central Italy and of the Latin colonies&nbsp;everywhere, even
                more than the indomitable perseverance&nbsp;of Rome and the supineness of Carthage,
                which caused his&nbsp;ultimate failure.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">In the spring of 217 Hannibal crossed the Apennines and marched
                southwards through the lowlands of eastern&nbsp;Etruria, the route taken before him
                by the Celtic hordes.&nbsp;In April he annihilated Flaminius and his army at
                the&nbsp;Trasimene Lake,@@<sup>3</sup> and pushed on to Spoletium, only a
            few</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">days’ march from Rome. But Rome was not yet his goal ; from
                Spoletium, which had closed its gates against him, he&nbsp;moved rapidly eastward,
                ravaging the territories of Roman&nbsp;allies as he went, till he reached the
                Adriatic and the&nbsp;fertile lands of northern Apulia, where supplies
                and&nbsp;especially remounts for his Numidian cavalry@@<sup>4</sup>
                were&nbsp;plentiful, and communication with Carthage easy, and&nbsp;where, moreover,
                he was well placed for testing the fidelity&nbsp;of the most recent and the least
                trustworthy of the Italian&nbsp;allies of Rome. A second victory here, on the scale
                of&nbsp;that at the Trasimene Lake, might be the signal for a&nbsp;general revolt
                against Roman rule. It was not, however,&nbsp;until the summer of the next year that
                his opportunity&nbsp;came. The patient tactics of Q. Fabius Cunctator
                had&nbsp;become unpopular at Rome; and the consuls of 216, L.&nbsp;Æmilius Paulus
                and M. Terentius Varro, took the field in&nbsp;Apulia, at the head of a larger force
                than Rome had yet&nbsp;raised, and with orders to fight and crush the
                daring&nbsp;invader. The result realized for the moment Hannibal’s&nbsp;highest
                hopes. The Roman army was annihilated at&nbsp;Cannæ ; and South Italy, with the
                exception of the Latin&nbsp;colonies and the Greek cities on the coast, came over to
                his&nbsp;side. Nor did the Roman misfortunes end here. Philip&nbsp;of Macedon
                concluded an alliance with Hannibal (215),&nbsp;and threatened an invasion of Italy.
                In the very next&nbsp;year Syracuse, no longer ruled by the faithful
                Hiero,&nbsp;revolted, and a Carthaginian force landed in Sicily ; lastly,&nbsp;in
                212 came the loss of the Greek cities on the south&nbsp;coast. But the truth of
                Polybius’s remark that the Romans&nbsp;are most to be feared when their danger is
                greatest was&nbsp;never better illustrated than by their conduct in the face&nbsp;of
                these accumulated disasters. Patiently and undauntedly&nbsp;they set themselves to
                regain the ground they had lost.&nbsp;Philip of Macedon was first of all forced to
                retire from the&nbsp;allied city of Apollonia which he had attacked (214),
                and&nbsp;then effectually diverted from all thoughts of an attack on&nbsp;Italy, by
                the formation of a coalition against him in Greece&nbsp;itself (211); Syracuse was
                recaptured in 212, after a&nbsp;lengthy siege, and Roman authority re-established in
                Sicily.&nbsp;In Italy itself the Roman commanders took advantage of&nbsp;Hannibal’s
                absence in the extreme south to reconquer&nbsp;northern Apulia ; but their main
                efforts were directed to&nbsp;the recovery of Campania, and above all of Capua.
                The&nbsp;imminent danger of Capua, which he hg,d named as the&nbsp;successor of Rome
                in the headship of Italy, recalled&nbsp;Hannibal from the south, where he was
                besieging a Roman&nbsp;garrison in the citadel of Tarentum. Failing to
                break&nbsp;through the lines which enclosed it, he resolved, as a last&nbsp;hope of
                diverting the Roman legions from the devoted city,&nbsp;to advance on Rome itself.
                But his march, deeply as it&nbsp;impressed the imagination of his contemporaries by
                its&nbsp;audacity and promptitude, was without result. Silently&nbsp;and rapidly he
                moved along the course of the Latin Way,&nbsp;through the heart of the territory of
                Rome, to within 3&nbsp;miles of the city, and even rode up with his
                advanced&nbsp;guard to the Colline gate. Yet no ally joined him ; no&nbsp;Roman
                force was recalled to face him ; no proposals for&nbsp;peace reached his camp,; and,
                overcome, it is said, by the&nbsp;unmoved confidence of his foe, he withdrew, as
                silently and&nbsp;rapidly as he had advanced, to his headquarters in the&nbsp;south.
                The fall of Capua followed inevitably (211),@@<sup>5</sup> and&nbsp;the Roman senate
                saw with relief the seat of war removed&nbsp;to Lucania and Bruttium, and a prospect
                opening of some&nbsp;relief from the exhausting exertions of the last five
                years.&nbsp;Their hopes were quickly dashed to the ground. The</span></p>
