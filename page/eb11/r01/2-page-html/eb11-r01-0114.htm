<p><span class="font2">RAMSAY, ALLAN (1686-1758), Scottish poet, was bom at Leadhills, Lanarkshire, on the 15th of October 1686. He was&nbsp;educated at the parish school of Crawford, and in 1701 was&nbsp;apprenticed to a wig-maker in Edinburgh. He married&nbsp;Christian Ross in 1712; a few years after he had established&nbsp;himself as a wig-maker (not as a barber, as has been often&nbsp;said) in the High Street, and soon found himself in comfortable&nbsp;circumstances. His first efforts in verse-making were inspired&nbsp;by the meetings of the Easy Club (founded in 1712), of which&nbsp;he was an original member; and in 1715 he became the Club&nbsp;Laureate. In the society of the members he assumed the&nbsp;name of “ Isaac Bickerstaff,” and later of “ Gawin Douglas,’’&nbsp;the latter partly in memory of his maternal grandfather Douglas&nbsp;of Muthill (Perthshire), and partly to give point to his boast&nbsp;that he was a “ poet sprung from a Douglas loin.” The choice&nbsp;of the two names has some significance, when we consider his&nbsp;later literary life as the associate of the Queen Anne poets and&nbsp;as a collector of old Scots poetry. By 1718 he had made some&nbsp;reputation as a writer of occasional verse, which he published&nbsp;in broadsheets, and then (or a year earlier) he turned bookseller&nbsp; in the premises where he had hitherto plied his craft of&nbsp;wig-making. In 1716 he had published a rough transcript of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Christ's Kirk on the Green</span><span class="font2"> from the Bannatyne MS., with some&nbsp;additions of his own. In 1718 he republished the piece with&nbsp;more supplementary verses. In the following year he printed&nbsp;a collection of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Scots Songs.</span><span class="font2"> The success of these ventures&nbsp;prompted him to collect his poems in 1722. The volume was&nbsp;issued by subscription, and brought in the sum of four hundred&nbsp;guineas. Four years later he removed to another shop, in the&nbsp;neighbouring Luckenbooths, where he opened a circulating&nbsp;library (the first in Scotland) and extended his business as a&nbsp;bookseller. Between the publication of the collected edition&nbsp;of his poems and his settling down in the Luckenbooths, he had&nbsp;published a few shorter poems and had issued the first instalments of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Tea-Table Miscellany</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Eυer Green</span><span class="font2"> (both&nbsp;1724-1727). </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Tea-Table Miscellany</span><span class="font2"> is “A Collection of&nbsp;Choice Songs Scots and English,’’ containing some of Ramsay’s&nbsp;own, some by his friends, several well-known ballads and songs,&nbsp;and some Caroline verse. Its title was suggested by the programme of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Spectator</span><span class="font2"> : and the compiler claimed the place&nbsp;for his songs “e’en while the tea’s fill’d reeking round,” which&nbsp;Addison sought for his speculations at the hour set apart “ for&nbsp;tea and bread and butter.’’ In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Ever Green, being a Collection of Scots Poems wrote by the Ingenious before 1600,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Ramsay had another purpose, to reawaken an interest in the&nbsp;older national literature. Nearly all the pieces were taken&nbsp;from the Bannatyne MS., though they are by no means verbatim copies. They included his version of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Christ's Kirk (u.s.) </span><span class="font2">and a remarkable </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pastiche</span><span class="font2"> by the editor entitled the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vision.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">While engaged on these two series, he produced, in 1725, his&nbsp;dramatic pastoral </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Gentle Shepherd.</span><span class="font2"> In the volume of&nbsp;poems published in 1722 Ramsay had shown his bent to this&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">genre,</span><span class="font2"> especially in “ Patie and Roger,’’ which supplies two&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dramatis personae</span><span class="font2"> to his greater work. The success of&nbsp;the drama was remarkable. It passed through several editions, and was performed at the theatre in Edinburgh; its&nbsp;title is still known in every corner of Scotland, even if it be no&nbsp;longer read. Ramsay wrote little afterwards, though he published a few shorter poems, and new editions of his earlier&nbsp;work. A complete edition of his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span><span class="font2"> appeared in London&nbsp;in 1731 and in Dublin in 1733. With a touch of vanity he&nbsp;expressed the fear lest “ the coolness of fancy that attends&nbsp;advanced years should make me risk the reputation I had&nbsp;acquired.&quot; He was already on terms of intimacy with the&nbsp;leading men of letters in Scotland and England. He corresponded with Hamilton of Bangour (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q.υ.</span><span class="font2">)</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font2"> Somerville (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q.υ.</span><span class="font2">)</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Gay (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q.v.</span><span class="font2">) and Pope. Gay visited him in Edinburgh, and Pope&nbsp;praised his pastoral—compliments which were undoubtedly&nbsp;responsible for some of Ramsay’s unhappy poetic ventures&nbsp;beyond his Scots vernacular. The poet had for many years&nbsp;been a warm supporter of the stage. Some of his prologues&nbsp;and epilogues were written for the London theatres. In 1736&nbsp;he set about the erection of a new theatre, “ at vast expense,’’&nbsp;in Carrubber’s Close, Edinburgh; but the opposition was too&nbsp;strong, and the new house was closed in 1737. In 1755 he&nbsp;retired from his shop to the house on the slope of the Castle&nbsp;Rock, still known as Ramsay Lodge. In this house, called by&nbsp;his friends “ the goose-pie,” because of its octagonal shape, the&nbsp;poet died on the 7th of January 1758.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ramsay’s importance in literary history is twofold. As a pastoral writer (“in some respects the best in the world,”&nbsp;according to Leigh Hunt) he contributed, at an early stage,&nbsp;to the naturalistic reaction of the 18th century. His </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gentle&nbsp;Shepherd,</span><span class="font2"> by its directness of impression and its appreciation of&nbsp;country life, anticipates the attitude of the school which broke&nbsp;with neo-classical tradition. It has the “ mixed ’’ faults which&nbsp;make the greater poem </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font2">his Scots successor, Thomson, a&nbsp;“ transitional ” document, but these give it an historical, if&nbsp;not an individual, interest. His chief place is, however, as&nbsp;an editor. He is the connecting-link between the greater&nbsp;“Makars’’ of the 15th and 16th centuries, and Fergusson&nbsp;(</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q.v.</span><span class="font2">) and Burns. He revived the interest in vernacular literature, and directly inspired the genius of his greater successors.&nbsp;The preface to his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ever Green</span><span class="font2"> is a protest against “ imported&nbsp;trimming ’’ and “ foreign embroidery in our writings,’’ and a&nbsp;plea for a return to simple Scottish tradition. He had no&nbsp;scholarly interest in the past, and he never hesitated to transform the texts when he could give contemporary “ point ” to&nbsp;a poem; but his instinct was good, and he did much to stimulate&nbsp;an ignorant public to fresh enjoyment. In this respect, too,&nbsp;he anticipates the reaction in England which followed securely&nbsp;on the publication of Percy’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reliques.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RAMSAY, ALLAN </span><span class="font2">(1713-1784), Scotch portrait-painter, the eldest son of the author of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Gentle Shepherd,</span><span class="font2"> was born at&nbsp;Edinburgh in 1713. Ramsay manifested an aptitude for art&nbsp;from an early period, and at the age of twenty we find him&nbsp;in London studying under the Swedish painter Hans Huyssing,&nbsp;and at the St Martin’s Lane Academy; and in 1736 he left&nbsp;for Rome, where he worked for three years under Solimena&nbsp;and Imperiali (Fernandi). On his return he settled in Edinburgh; and, having attracted attention by his head of Forbes&nbsp;of Culloden and his full-length of the duke of Argyll, he&nbsp;removed to London, where he was patronized by the duke&nbsp;of Bridgewater. His pleasant manners and varied culture,&nbsp;not less than his artistic skill, contributed to render him popular.&nbsp;In 1767 he was appointed to succeed Shakelton as. principal&nbsp;painter to the king; and so fully employed was he on the&nbsp;royal portraits which the king was in the habit of presenting&nbsp;to ambassadors and colonial governors, that he was forced to&nbsp;take advantage of the services of a host of assistants—of whom&nbsp;David Martin and Philip Reinagle are the best known. His&nbsp;life în London was varied by frequent visits to Italy, where&nbsp;he occupied himself more in literary and antiquarian research&nbsp;than with art. But this prosperous career came to an end,&nbsp;his health being shattered by an accidental dislocation of the</span></p>
