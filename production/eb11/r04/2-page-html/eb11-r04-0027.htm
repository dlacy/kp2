                    protection of the tribunals. Stipulations&nbsp;became the complement of
                    engagements which without them&nbsp;rested simply on good faith, as when a
                    vendor gave his stipu-latory promise to his vendee to guarantee peaceable
                    possession&nbsp;of the thing sold or its freedom from faults, and the vendee
                    in&nbsp;turn gave his promise for payment of the price. The question&nbsp;and
                    answer in the form prescribed by law made the engagement&nbsp;fast and sure.

                    intimidation,&nbsp;effects of conditions and specifications of time, and so

                    many&nbsp;years after it had come into use; and the probability is that it
                    originated before the middle of the 5th century of the city, its first statutory

                    . There&nbsp;are many examples of such simplification of terms, none

                    consideration whether or not value had been given&nbsp;for it. In time this
                    serious disadvantage was abated by praetorian exceptions and otherwise, as will
                    be noted below. Originally the stipulation was employed only in regard to
                    engagements whose terms were in every respect definite and certain,&nbsp;and was
                    enforced by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legis
