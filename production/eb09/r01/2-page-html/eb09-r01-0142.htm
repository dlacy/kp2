His conduct in this dilemma&nbsp;has been generally regarded as indefensible. In order to&nbsp;show that he disclaimed the right of the pontiff to nominate to ecclesiastical offices in England, he surrendered&nbsp;the several bulls, eleven in number, into Henry’s hands;&nbsp;and, having done this, he took the usual oath of obedience&nbsp;to the see of Rome.@@<sup>1</sup> Before doing so, however, he made&nbsp;a protestation to the effect that he did not intend thereby&nbsp;to bind himself to do anything contrary to the laws of&nbsp;God, the king’s prerogative, or the commonwealth and&nbsp;statutes of the kingdom. On 23d May 1533 he proceeded,&nbsp;as archbishop and legate of the apostolic see, to pronounce&nbsp;the king’s marriage with Catherine of Aragon null and&nbsp;void </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ab initio,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> as contrary to the divine law; and five&nbsp;days later he gave judicial confirmation to the royal&nbsp;marriage with Anne Boleyn. In the following year (23d&nbsp;March 1534) Clement rejoined by a manifesto declaring&nbsp;the validity of the first marriage, and calling upon Henry&nbsp;to take back his first wife and to observe “a perpetual&nbsp;silence ” in relation to the question for the future.@@<sup>2</sup> This&nbsp;decisive step was mainly the result of the parliamentary&nbsp;action that had in the meantime been going on. The&nbsp;parliament of 1529 had in various ways limited the privileges of the clergy, and by the Act 21 Hen. VIII. c. 13&nbsp;had deprived them of the power of holding pluralities by&nbsp;virtue of licences obtained from Rome for money. Fisher,&nbsp;from his place in the House of Lords, vainly sought to&nbsp;combat these reforms by declaring that Lutheranism ·was&nbsp;spreading in the nation and by reminding his audience of&nbsp;Germany and Bohemia and the miseries that had already&nbsp;befallen those countries. The allusion to the Lutheran&nbsp;movement appears to have been, indeed, singularly injudicious, and there can be no doubt that at this period it&nbsp;was the aim not only of the king but of the bishops to&nbsp;dissociate the Reformation movement in England from&nbsp;the movement that was in progress in Germany. As yet&nbsp;the repudiation of the papal supremacy and a reform in&nbsp;matters of discipline were all that was contemplated either&nbsp;by the crown or the parliament. In 1531 appeared a proclamation making it penal to introduce bulls from Rome,&nbsp;and this was shortly followed by an Act visiting with&nbsp;severe penalties all who should be found going about the&nbsp;country for the purpose of carrying on the sale of indulgences ; while under the famous Statute of Praemunire the&nbsp;whole body of the clergy were convicted of having recognized the validity of Wolsey’s acts as papal legate, and&nbsp;thereby placed both their liberties and their possessions&nbsp;at the mercy of the king. In April 1533 there followed&nbsp;the Act providing that all causes should henceforth be&nbsp;tried in the courts of the kingdom, and forbidding appeals&nbsp;to Rome under any circumstances whatever,—the body&nbsp;“now being usually called the English Church” being&nbsp;held “sufficient and meet of itself to declare and determine all such doubts and duties as to their rooms </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">\i.e.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">offices] spiritual doth appertain.” These successive enactments had already paved the way for Henry’s final rejoinder&nbsp;to Clement’s demands,—the Act of Supremacy (November&nbsp;1534), whereby the king was not only declared to be&nbsp;supreme head of the Church of England, but was at the&nbsp;same time invested with full power “ to repress and amend&nbsp;all such errors and heresies as, by any manner of spiritual&nbsp;jurisdiction, might and ought to be lawfully reformed.”</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should, however, be noted that Cranmer’s oath as metropolitan&nbsp;contained the clause “ salvo ordine meo,” and this clause might probably, in the judgment of canonists, render his subsequent reservation&nbsp;more defensible.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">While such was the progress of events in England and in Germany there had been going on in Switzerland a corresponding movement, second only in importance to that,&nbsp;initiated by Luther. The political relations of the Swiss '&nbsp;confederation at this period exercised a very appreciable&nbsp;influence over the whole course of the Reformation. With&nbsp;the commencement of the century the cantons had already&nbsp;reached the number of thirteen ; and the confederates,&nbsp;in combination with the Leaguers, represented Italian as&nbsp;well as German interests. In great crises they were not&nbsp;incapable of presenting a combined front to the common&nbsp;foe ; but more generally they were divided by political&nbsp;jealousies and differences, while the majority of the men&nbsp;in each canton were mere military adventurers, ready to&nbsp;serve under the banner of the empire, France, the pope,&nbsp;or the duke of Milan, according as the one or the other&nbsp;power seemed likely best to reward their services. An&nbsp;important change in the ecclesiastical relations of the&nbsp;cantons had recently brought them into closer connexion&nbsp;with Rome. The six bishoprics into which Switzerland&nbsp;was divided—Lausanne, Sion (Sitten), Como, Basel, Chur,&nbsp;and Constance—had formerly been severally subject to&nbsp;the metropolitan jurisdiction of Mainz, Besançon, and&nbsp;Milan. But this jurisdiction had been superseded by the&nbsp;creation of the nunciatures, whereby each bishopric was&nbsp;brought into direct connexion with the papal see. The&nbsp;nuncios often exercised a potent influence on the political&nbsp;relations of the confederates. They negotiated with large&nbsp;bodies of Switzers the conditions of military service under&nbsp;the pope ; they directed the traffic in indulgences ; and&nbsp;they watched with especial jealousy the first appearance&nbsp;of schism. The experience, however, of those of the confederates who accepted military service in Italy did not&nbsp;serve to increase their reverence for the Curia and its aims.&nbsp;They carried back with them to their homes a contempt&nbsp;for the whole administration of the Roman see and its&nbsp;dependencies which communicated itself to their countrymen, and at no centres were opinions adverse to Catholicism now spreading more rapidly than at Zurich, Bern,&nbsp;and Basel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Born in the same year as his brother Reformer, Ulrich Zwingli was scarcely less distinguished by commanding&nbsp;powers, devotion to study, and a yet more notable devotion to truth ; but in the enlightened tolerance which&nbsp;marked his whole career we recognize the contrast between his early associations and those which nurtured the&nbsp;somewhat narrow though fervid patriotism of Luther.&nbsp;The latter, in the retirement of his monastic cell, had&nbsp;pondered over the profound speculations of Augustine, the&nbsp;imaginative subtleties of De Lyra, and the mysticism of&nbsp;Tauler. The other, at the universities of Vienna and&nbsp;Basel, had become familiarized with classic models, and&nbsp;his genius had gained a brighter inspiration from converse&nbsp;with the masterpieces of antiquity. It was in connexion&nbsp;with the church at Glarus that Zwingli first assumed the&nbsp;discharge of pastoral duties. It was characteristic of his&nbsp;true and discerning patriotic feeling that he strongly disapproved of the acceptance of mercenary service by his&nbsp;countrymen, and more especially of the service of France,&nbsp;and his outspoken sentiments on the subject eventually&nbsp;rendered it necessary for him to quit Glarus for Einsiedeln.&nbsp;Here he was for a short time in receipt of a pension from&nbsp;the pope and was generally regarded as a supporter of&nbsp;Catholic institutions. In conjunction with the abbot of&nbsp;Einsiedeln he aimed, however, at the development of a&nbsp;less superstitious spirit among both the clergy and the&nbsp;laity, who resorted in great numbers to the monastery (a&nbsp;noted centre for pilgrimages). It was here that he formed&nbsp;the acquaintance of one of the most eminent of the Reformers, Oswald Geisshàusler (better known as Myconius),</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
