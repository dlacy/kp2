<p><span class="font0">between the dilatations of the fibres and the resistances which they exert in this state of dilatation, we cannot positively say&nbsp;where the point cis situated, nor what is the sum of the actual&nbsp;resistances, or the point where their action may be supposed&nbsp;concentrated. The firmer woods, such as oak and chestnut,&nbsp;may be supposed to be but slightly compressible ; we know&nbsp;that willow and other soft woods are very compressible.&nbsp;These last must therefore be weaker ; for it is evident, that&nbsp;the fibres which are in a state of compression do not resist&nbsp;the fracture. It is well known, that a beam of willow may&nbsp;be cut through from C to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font0"> without weakening it in the&nbsp;least, if the cut be filled up by a wedge of hard wood stuck&nbsp;in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We can only say, that very sound oak and red fir have the centre of effort so situated, that the absolute strength&nbsp;is to the relative strength in a proportion of not less than&nbsp;that of three and a half times the length of the beam to its&nbsp;depth. A square inch of sound oak will carry about 8000&nbsp;pounds. If this bar be firmly fixed in a wall, and project&nbsp;twelve inches, and be loaded at the extremity with 200&nbsp;pounds, it will be broken. It will just bear 190, its relative strength being ⅛ of its absolute strength ; and this is&nbsp;the case only with the finest pieces, so placed that their&nbsp;annual plates or layers are in a vertical position. A larger&nbsp;log is not so strong transversely, because its plates lie in&nbsp;various directions round the heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These observations are enough to give us a distinct notion of the vast diminution of the strength of timber when the strain is across it ; and we see the justice of the maxim&nbsp;which we inculcated, that the carpenter, in framing roofs,&nbsp;should avoid as much as possible the exposing his timbers&nbsp;to transverse strains. But this cannot be avoided in all&nbsp;cases. Nay, the ultimate strain arising from the very nature of a roof is transverse. The rafters must carry their&nbsp;own weight, and this tends to break them across. An oak&nbsp;beam a foot deep will not carry its own weight if it project&nbsp;more than sixty feet. Besides this, the rafters must carry&nbsp;the lead, tiling, or slates. We must therefore consider this&nbsp;transverse strain a little more particularly, so as to know&nbsp;what strain will be laid on any part by an unavoidable load,&nbsp;imposed either at that part or at any other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have hitherto supposed, that the beam had one of its ends fixed in a wall, and that it was loaded at the other end.&nbsp;This is not an usual arrangement, and was taken merely as&nbsp;affording a simple application of the mechanical principles.&nbsp;It is much more usual to have the beam supported at the&nbsp;ends, and loaded in the middle. Let the beam FEGH&nbsp;(fig. 2) rest on the props</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">E and G, and be loaded</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">at its middle point C with</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">a weight W. It is re</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">quired to determine the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">strain at the section CD.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is plain that the beam</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">will receive the same</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">support, and suffer the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">same strain, if, instead</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of the blocks E and G,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">we substitute the ropes </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ffe, Hhg,</span><span class="font0"> going over the pulleys </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">f </span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g,</span><span class="font0"> and loaded with proper weights e and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g.</span><span class="font0"> The weight&nbsp;e is equal to the support given by the block E ; and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font0"> is&nbsp;equal to the support given by G. The sιun of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font0"> is&nbsp;equal to W ; and on whatever point W is hung, the weights&nbsp;e and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font0"> are to W in the proportion of DG and DE to GE.&nbsp;Now, in this state of things, it appears that the strain on&nbsp;the section CD arises immediately from the upward action&nbsp;of the ropes </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ff</span><span class="font0"> and HA, or the upward pressions of the&nbsp;blocks E and G ; and that the office of the weight W is to&nbsp;oblige the beam to oppose this strain. Things are in the&nbsp;same state in respect, of strain as if a block were substituted at D for the weight W, and the weights e and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font0"> were&nbsp;hung on at E and G, only the directions will be opposite.&nbsp;The bcam tends to break in the section CD, because the&nbsp;ropes pull it upwards at E and G, whilst a weight W holds&nbsp;it down at C. It tends to open at D, and C becomes the&nbsp;centre of fracture. The strain therefore is the same as if&nbsp;the half ED were fixed in the wall, and a weight equal to&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g,</span><span class="font0"> that is, to the half of W, were hung on at G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hence we conclude, that a beam supported at both ends, but not fixed there, and loaded in the middle, will carry&nbsp;four times as much weight as it can carry at its extremity,&nbsp;when the other extremity is fast in a wall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The strain occasioned at any point L by a weight W, DE</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">hung on at any other point D, is = W × -gθ × LG. For</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">EG is to ED as W to the pressure occasioned at G. This would be balanced by some weight </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font0"> acting over the pulley A ,∙ and this tends to break the beam at L, by acting</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">DE</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">on the lever GL. The pressure at G is W × ==, and there-EG</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">DE</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">fore the strain at L is W X ■== × LG.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">EG</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In like manner, the strain occasioned at the point D by DE</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the weight W huDg on there, is W χ <sub>7</sub>= × DG ; which is EG</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">therefore equal to ½ W when D is the middle point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hence we see that the general strain on the beam arising from one weight, is proportional to the rectangle of the parts of the beam (for — </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:line-through;">* D</span><span class="font0">E</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:line-through;">^×D</span><span class="font0">G '<sup>s as x</sup> DG),</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and is greatest when the load is laid on the middle of the bcam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We also see, that the strain at L by a load at D, is equal to the strain at D by the same load at L. And the&nbsp;strain at L from a load at D is to the strain by the same&nbsp;load at L as DE to LE. These are all very obvious corollaries, and they sufficiently inform us concerning the strains&nbsp;which are produced on any part of the timber by a load&nbsp;laid on any other part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If we now suppose the beam to be fixed at the two ends, that is, firmly framed or held down by blocks at I and K,&nbsp;placed beyond E and G, or framed into posts, it will carry&nbsp;twice as much as when its ends were free. For suppose it&nbsp;sawn through at CD, the weight W hung on there will be&nbsp;just sufficient to break it at E and G. Now restore the&nbsp;connection of the section CD, it will require another weight&nbsp;W to break it there at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Therefore, when a rafter, or any piece of timber, is firmly connected with three fixed points, G, E, I, it will&nbsp;bear a greater load between any two of them than if its&nbsp;connection with the remote point were removed ; and if it&nbsp;be fastened in four points, G, E, I, K, it will be twice as&nbsp;strong in the middle part as without the two remote connections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One is apt to expect from this that the joist of a floor will be much strengthened by being firmly built in the wall.&nbsp;It is a little strengthened ; but the hold which can thus be&nbsp;given to it is much too short to be of any sensible service,&nbsp;and it tends greatly to shatter the wall, because, when it is&nbsp;bent down by a load, it forces up the wall with a momentum of a long lever. Judicious builders therefore take care&nbsp;not to bind the joists tight in the wall. But when the joists&nbsp;of adjoining rooms lie in the same direction, it is a great&nbsp;advantage to make them of one piece. They are then&nbsp;twice as strong as when made in two lengths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is easy to deduce from these premises the strain on any point which arises from the weight of the beam itself,&nbsp;or from any load which is uniformly diffused over the whole&nbsp;or any part. We may always consider the whole of the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
