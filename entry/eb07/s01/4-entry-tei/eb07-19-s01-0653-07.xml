in <hi rend="italic">Astronomy,</hi> one of the planets of our solar system, revolving at the distance of more than nine hundred millions of miles from the sun.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Saturn,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">chemistry,</hi> is an appellation which was formerly given to lead.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sλturn,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Heraldry,</hi> denotes the black colour in blazoning the arms of sovereign princes.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Saturn,</hi> one of the principal of the Pagan deities, was the son of Coelus and Terra, and the father of Jupiter. He deposed and castrated his father, and obliged his brother Titan to resign to him his crown, on condition of his bringing up none of his male issue, that the succession might at length devolve on him. For this purpose he devoured all the sons he had by his wife Rhea or Cybele ; but she bringing forth at one time Jupiter and Juno, presented the latter to her husband, and sent the boy to be nursed on Mount Ida, when Saturn, being informed of her having a son, demanded the child, but in his stead his wife gave him a stone swaddled up like an infant, which he instantly swallowed. Titan, finding that Saturn had violated the contract he had made with him, put himself at the head of his children and made war on his brother, and having taken him and Cybele prisoners, confined them in Tartarus ; but Jupiter being in the mean time grown up, raised an army in Crete, went to his father’s assistance, defeated Titan, and restored Saturn to the throne. Some time after this, Saturn being told that Jupiter intended to dethrone him, endeavoured to prevent it ; but the latter being informed of his intention, deposed his father, and threw him into Tartarus. Saturn having es</p><p>caped from thence, however, fled into Italy, where he was kindly received by Janus, king of the country, who associated him in the government ; and hence Italy obtained the name of <hi rend="italic">Saturnia Tellus,</hi> as also that of <hi rend="italic">Latium,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">lateo,</hi> to lie hidden. There Saturn, by the wisdom and mildness of his government, is said to have produced the golden age.</p><p>Saturn is represented as an old man with four wings, armed with a scythe ; and sometimes he is delineated under the figure of a serpent with its tail in its mouth. This is emblematical of the seasons, which roll perpetually in the same circle. Sometimes also Saturn is painted with a sandglass in his hand. The Greeks say that the story of his mutilating his father and destroying his children is an allegory, which signifies, that Time devours the past and present, and will also devour the future. The Romans, in honour of him, built a temple, and celebrated a festival which they denominated <hi rend="italic">Saturnalia.</hi> During this festival no business or profession was allowed to be carried on except cookery ; all distinctions of rank ceased ; slaves could say with impunity what they pleased to their masters, and they could even rally them to their faces with their faults.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
