                <p><label>RELIGION</label> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Religio</hi>), is a Latin word
                    derived, according to Cicero<note anchored="true" place="margin"
                        type="authorial" n="1"><hi rend="italic">De Natura Deorum,</hi> lib. 2. §
                        28.</note>,from <hi rend="italic">relegere,</hi> “ to re-consider;" but
                    according to Servius and moſt modern grammarians, from <hi rend="italic">religare,</hi> "to bind faſt. <hi rend="sup">,</hi> lhe reaſon aſſigned
                    by the Roman orator for deducing <hi rend="italic">religio</hi> from <hi
                        rend="italic"> relego,</hi> is in theſe words, " qui autem omnia, quæ ad
                    cultum deo-rum pertinerent, diligenter retracterent, et tanquam re-legerent,
                    ſunt dicti <hi rend="italic">relifiοfi</hi> ex relegendo.” The reaſon given by
                    Servius ſor his derivation of the word is, “ quod mentem religio religet.” If
                    the Ciceronian etymology be the true one, the word <hi rend="italic">religion</hi> will denote the diligent ſtudy of whatever pertains to the worſhip of
                    the’gods ; but according to the other derivation, which we are inclined to
                    prefer, it denotes that obligation which we feel on our minds from the relation
                    in which we ſtand to feme ſuperior power. In either cafe, the import of the word <hi rend="italic">religion</hi> is different from that of <hi
                        rend="italic"> theology,</hi> as the former fignifies a number of practical
                    duties, and the latter a ſyſtem of ſpeculative truths. <hi rend="italic">Theology</hi> is therefore the foundation of <hi rend="italic">religion,</hi> or the ſcience from which it ſprings ; for no man can ſtudy -what pertains
                    to the worſhip of ſuperior powers Jill he believe that .ſhch powers exiſt, or
                    feel any obligation on his mind from a relation of which he knows nothing.</p>
                <p>This idea of religion, as diſtinguiſhed from theo-logy, comprehends the duties
                    not only of thofe more re-fined and complicated ſyſtems of theiſm or polytheiſm
                    which have prevailed among civilized and enlightened nations, ſuch as the
                    polytheiſm of the Greeks and Romans, and the theiſm of the Jews, the Mahometans,
                    and the Chriſtians ; it comprehends every ſentiment of obligation which human
                    beings have ever conceived themſelves under to ſuperior powers, as well as all
                    the forms of worſhip which have ever been practiſed through the world, however
                    fantaſtic, immoral, or abſurd.</p>
                <p>when we turn our eyes to this feature of the human character, we find it
                    peculiarly intereſting. Mankind are diſtinguiſhed from the brutal tribes, and
                    elevated to an higher rank, by the rational and moral faculties with which they
                    are endowed ; but they are ſtiil more widely diſtinguiſhed from the inferior
                    creation, and more highly exalted above them, by being made capable of religious
                    notions and religious ſentiments. The ſlighteſt knowledge of hiſtory is
                    ſufficient to inform us, that religion has ever had a powerful influence in
                    moulding the ſentiments and manners of men. It has ſometimes dignified, and
                    ſometimes degraded, the human character. In one region or age it has been
                    favourable to ci-vilization and refinement ; in another, it has occafionally
                    cramped the genius, depraved the morals, and deform-ed the manners of men. The
                    varieties ot religion are innumerable ; and the members of every diſtinct ſect
                    muſt view all who differ from them as more or leſs miſtaken with reſpect to the
                    moſt important concerns of man. Religion ſeems to be congenial to the heart of
                    man ; for wherever human ſociety ſubſiſts, there we are certain of finding
                    religious opinions and ſentiments.</p>
                <p>It muſt, therefore, be an important fubject of ſpecu-lation to the man and the
                    philoſopher to confider the origin of religion ; to inquire, How far religion in
                    general has a tendency to promote or to injn-e the order and happineſs of
                    ſociety ? and, above all, to examine, what particular religion is beſt
                    calculated to produce an happy influence on human life ?</p>
                <p>ΛVe ſhall endeavour to give a fatisfactory anſwer to each of thefe queſtions,
                    referving to the article Theology the conſideration of the dogmas of that
                    particular religion which, from our preſent inquiries, ſhall appear to be true,
                    and to have the happieſt influence on human life and manners.</p>
                <p>I. The foundation of all religion reſts on the belief of the exiſtence of one or
                    more ſuperior beings, who govern the world, and upon whom the happinefs or
                    mi-ſery of mankind ultimately depends. Οί this belief, as it may be faid to have
                    been univerlal, there ſeem to be but three ſources that can be conceived. Either
                    the image of Deity mnſt be ſtamped on the mind of every human being, the ſavage
                    as well as the fage; or the founders of ſocieties, and other eminent perſons,
                    tracing by the efforts of their own reaſon viſible effects to inviſible caufes,
                    muſt have difcovered the exiſtence of ſuperior powers, and communicated the
                    diſcovery to their aſſociates and fol-lowers ; or, laſtly, the univeτfal belief
                    in ſuch powers muſt have been derived by tradition from a primaeval re-velation,
                    communicated to the progenitors ωf the hu-man race.</p>
                <p>Οηε or other of theſe hypotheſes muſt be true, becaufe a fourth cannot be
                    framed. But we have elſewhere (Polytheism, n <hi rend="sup">o</hi> 2.)
                    examined the reaſoning which has been employed to eſtabliſh the firſt, and ſhewn
                    that it proceeds upon falſe notions of human nature, we ſhould likewiſe
                    pronounce it contrary to fact, could we believe, on the authority of ſome of its
                    patrons, who are not aſhamed to contradict one another, that the Kamtſchatkans,
                    and other tribes, in the loweſt ſtate of reaſoning and morals, haVe no ideas
                    whatever of Deity. we proceed, therefore, to conſider the ſecond hypotheſis,
                    which is much more plauſible, and will beara ſtricter ſcrutiny.</p>
                <p>That the exiſtence and many oſ the attributes of the Deity are capable of rigid
                    demonſtration, is a truth which cannot be controverted either by the philoſopher
                    or the Chriſtian ; for " the invifible things ot Him from the creation of the
                    world are clearly ſeen, being under-ſtood by the things that are made, even His
                    eternal power and Godhead,” (fee <hi rend="smallcaps">Metaphysics,</hi> Part
                    III.</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0061" facs="gri_33125011196389_0067.tif"/>
                <p>chap, <hi rend="italic">v!,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Theology,</hi> n <hi rend="sup">0</hi> 8, 9.) But ſurely itwould be raſh to infer, either
                    that every truth for which, when it is known, the ingenuity of man can frame a
                    demonſtration, is therefore <hi rend="italic">diſcover able</hi> by human
                    ſagacity, or that all the truths which have been diſcovered by a <hi
                        rend="italic"> Newton</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">Lot he</hi> might
                    therefore have been diſcovered by untaught barbarians. In mathematical foiençe,
                    there are few demonſtrations of ea-fier comprehenſion than that given by Euclid,
                    of the theorem of which Pythagoras is the reputed author ; yet no man ever
                    dreamed that a boy capable of being made to undeιſtand that theorem, muſt
                    therefore have ſagacity equal to the fagc of Samos; or that ſuch a boy, having
                    never heard of the relation between the hypo-then uſe and other two ſides of a
                    right angled triangle, would be likely to <hi rend="italic">diſcover</hi> that
                    the ſquare ot the former js preciſely equal to the ſum of the ſquares of the
                    latter. Juſt fo it feems to be with the fundamental truths of theology. There
                    can hardly be conceived a demonſtration lefs intricate, or more concluſive, than
                    that which the man of ſcience employs to prove the exiſtence of at leaſt one
                    God, poſſeſſed of boundleſs power and perfect wiſdom. And could we ſuppoſe that
                    the human race had remained without any knowledge oſ God in the world, till
                    certain lucky individuals had by ſome means or other made themſelves maſters oſ
                    the rules oſ logic, and the philoſophy of cauſes, there can be no doubt but that
                    theſe individuals might have diſcovered the exiſtence of ſuperior powers, and
                    communicated their diſcovery to their aiſociates and followers. But this
                    iuppofitιon cannot be admitted, as it is contradicted by the evidence of all
                    hiſtory. No nation or tribe has ever been found, in which there is not reafon to
                    believe that fome notions were entertained of fuperior and inviſible powers,
                    upon which depends the happinefs or mifery of mankind : and from the moſt
                    authentic records cf antiquity, it is apparent that very pure principles of
                    theiſm prevailed in ſome nations long before the rules of logic, and the
                    philoſophy of cauſes, were thought of by any people under heaven.</p>
                <p>The ſuppoſition before us is inadmiſſible upon other accounts. Some modern
                    philoſophers have fancied that the original progenitors of mankind were left
                    entirely to themſelves from the moment ot their creation; that they wandered
                    about for ages without the uſe of ipeech and in the loweſt ſtate of ſavagiſin ;
                    but that they gradually civilized themſelves, and at laſt ſtumbled upon the
                    contrivance of making articulate founds ſignificant of ideas, which was followed
                    by the invention of arts and ſciences, with all the bleſſings of religion and
                    legiſlation in their train. But this is a wild reverie, inconſiſtent with the
                    phenomena of human nature.</p>
                <p>It is a well known fact, that a man blind from his birth, and fuddeπly made to
                    ſee, would not by means <hi rend="sup">,</hi> cf his newly acquired ſenſe
                    diſcern either the magnitude or figure or diſtance of objects, but would
                    conceive every thing which communicated to him viſible ſenſations as inſeparably
                    united to his eye or his mind (See Me-taphysics, n° 49—53)· How long his ienle
                    of ſight would remain in ſuch an imperfect ſtate, we cannot poſitively fay ; but
                    from attending to the viſible ſenſations of infants, we are confident that
                    weeks, if not months, elapſe before they can diſtinguiſh one thing from another.
                    we have indeed been told, that Cheſelden’a famous patient, though he was at
                    ſirſt in the ſtate which we have deſcribed, learned to diſtinguiſh objects by
                    ſight in the courſe of a few hours, or at the moſt of a few days ; but admitting
                    this to a certain extent to be true, it may eaſily be accounted for. The diſeaſe
                    call-ed a <hi rend="italic">cataract</hi> foldυm occaſions total blindneſs ;
                    but let us iuppoie the eyes of this man to have been ſo completely dimmed as to
                    communicate no ſenſation whatever upon being expofed to the rays of light; ſtill
                    we muſt remember that he had long poſſeſſed the power of loco-motion and all his
                    other ſenſes in perfection. He was therefore well acquainted with the real, <hi
                        rend="italic"> i. e,</hi> the tangible magnitude, figure, and diſtance of
                    many υb-jects ; and having been often told that the tilings which he touched
                    would, upon his acquiſition oſ ſight, com-municate new ſeniations to his mind,
                    differing ſrom each other according to the diſtance, figure, and magnitude of
                    the objects by which they were occaſioned, he would foon learn to infer the one
                    ſrom the other, and to diſtinguiſh near objects by means oſ his ſight.</p>
                <p>Ί he progenitors oſ the human race, however, iſ leſt to themielves from the
                    moment oſ their creation, had not the ſame advantages. when they ſirſt opened
                    their eyes, they had neither moved, nor handled, nor heard, nor ſinelled, nor
                    tailed, nor had a ſingle idea or notion treaſured up in their memories ; but
                    were in alI theſe reſpects in the ſtate oi new-born infants. Now we ſhould be
                    glad to be informed by thoſe ſages who have conducted mankind through many
                    generations in which they were <hi rend="italic">mutum et turpe pecus</hi> to
                    that happy pe-ricd when they invented language, how the ſirſt men were taught to
                    diſtinguiſh objects by their ſenſe of ſight, and how they contrived to <hi
                        rend="italic"> live</hi> till this moſt ne-ceiſary faculty was acquired ?
                    It does not appear that men are like brutes, provided with a number oſ inilinct⅛
                    which guide them blindfold and without experience to whatever is neceſſary ſor
                    their own preſervation (ſee Instinct) : Ο11 the contrary, all voyagers tell us
                    that,, in ſtrange and uninhabited countries, they dare not venture to taſte
                    unknown fruits unleſs they perceive that theſe fruits are eaten by the fowls of
                    the air. But with-out the aid of inſtinct, or of ſome other guide equally to be
                    depended upon, it is not in our power to conceive how men dropt from the hands
                    of their Creator, and left from that inſtant wholly to themſelvcs, could move a
                    ſingle ſtep without the moſt imminent danger, or even ſtretch out their hands to
                    lay hold of that food which we may ſuppoſe to have been placed within their
                    reach. They could not, for mauy days, diſtinguiſh a precipice from a plane, a
                    rock from a pit, or a ■river from the meadows through which it rolled. And in
                    ſuch circumſtances, how could they pofſibly exiſt, till their ſenſe of ſight had
                    acquired ftιch perfection as to be a ſuſſicient guide to all their neceſlary
                    motions <hi rend="italic">ί</hi> Can any conſiſtent theiſt ſuppoſe that the
                    God whoſe goodneis is lo conſpicuouſiy diſplayed in all his works, would leave

                    brought all their organs, external and internal, at once to their utmoſt
                    poſſible ſtate of perfection ; taught them inſtantaneouſly the laws of
                    reaſon-ing ; and, in one word, ſtored their minds with every branch of uſeful
                    knowledge ? This is indeed our own opinion ; and it is perfectly agreeable to
                    what we are taught by the Hebrew lawgiver. when God had formed Adam and Eve,
                    Moſes does not ſay that he leſt them to acquire by flow degrees the ufe of their
                    ſenfes and reaſoning powers, and to diſtinguiſh as they could fruits that were
                    ſalutary from thoſe that were poiſonous. No : he placed them in a garden where
                    every tree but one bore fruit fit for food ; he warned them particulaιly againſt
                    the fruit of that tree; he brought before them the various animals which roamed
                    through the garden ; he arranged theſe animals into their proper genera and
                    ſpeciee ; and by teaching Adam to give them names, he communicated to the firſt
                    pair the elements of language. This condeſcenſion appears in every reſpect
                    worthy of perfect benevolence ; and indeed without it the helpleſs man and woman
                    could not have lived one whole week. But it cannot be ſup-poſed, that amidſt ſo
                    much uſeful inſtruction the gra-cious Creator would neglect to communicate to
                    his rational creatures the knowledge of himſelf ; to inform them of their own
                    origin, and the relation in which they ſtood to him ; and to ſtate in the
                    plaineſt terms the duties incumbent on them in return for fo much goodnefs.</p>
                <p>In what manner all this knowledge was communica-±ed, cannot be certainly known.
                    It may have been in either of the following ways conceivable by us, or in others
                    of which we can form no conception. God may have miraculouſly ſtored the minds
                    of the ſirſt pair with adequate ideas and notions of ſenſible and intellectual
                    objects ; and then by an internal operation of his own Spirit have enabled them
                    to exert at once their rational faculties ſo as to difcover his exiſtence and
                    attributes, together with the relation in which as creatures they ſtood to him
                    their Almighty Creator. Ον, after rendering them capable of diſtinguiſhing
                    objects by means of their ſenſes, of comparing their ideas, and underſtand-ing a
                    language, he may have exhibited himtelt under ſome ſenſible emblem, and
                    conducted them by degrees from one branch of knowledge to another, as a
                    tehool-maſter conducts his pupilβ, till they were ſufficiently acquainted with
                    every thing relating to their own happinefs and duty as rational, moral, and
                    religious, creatures. In determining the queſtion before us, it is of no
                    importance whether infinite wiſdom adopted either of theſe methods, or fome
                    other different from them, both which we cannot conceive. The ordinary proceſs
                    in which men acquire knowledge is, by the laws of their nature, extremely
                    tedious. They cannot reafon before their minds be ſtored with ideas and notions
                    ; and they cannot acquire theſe but through the medium of their ſenſes long
                    exerciſed on external objects.</p>
                <p>The progenitors of the human race, left to inform themſelves by this proceſs,
                    muſt have inevitably periſhed before they had acquired one diſtinct notion ; and
                    it is the fame thing with reſpect to the origin of religion, whether God
                    preferved them from deſtruction by aa <hi rend="italic">internal</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic"> external</hi> revelation. If he ſtored their minds at once
                    with the rudiments of all uſeful knowledge, and</p>
                <p>rendered them capable of exerting thcir rational faculties, ſo as, by tracing
                    effects to their cauſes, to diſcover his being and attributes, he <hi
                        rend="italic"> revealed</hi> himſelf to them as certainly as he did
                    afterwards to Moſes, when to him he condeſcended to fpeak face to face.</p>
                <p>If this reaſoning be admitted as fair and concluſive, and wc apprehend that the
                    principles on which it proceeds cannot be conſidered as ill-founded, we have
                    advanced ſo far as to prove that mankind muſt have been originally enlightened
                    by a revelation. But it is ſcarce neceſſary to obſerve, that this revelation
                    mnſt have been handed down through ſucceeding generations. It could not fail to
                    reach the era of the deluge. It is not abfurd to ſuppoſe, that he who ſpake from
                    heaven to Adam, ſpake alſo to Noah. And both the revelation which had been
                    handed down to the poſtdeluvian patriarch by tradition, and that which was
                    communicated immediately to himſelf, would be by him made known to his
                    deſcendants. Thus it appears almoſt impoſſible that ſome part of the religious
                    ſentiments of mankind ſhould not have been derived from revelation ; and that
                    not of the religious ſentiments of one particular family or tribe, but of almoſt
                    all the nations of the earth.</p>
                <p>This concluſion, which we have deduced by fair rea-ſoning from the benevolence
                    of God and the nature of man, is confirmed by the authority of the Jewiſh and
                    Chriſtian Scriptures, which are entitled to more implicit credit than all the
                    other records of ancient hiſ-tory.</p>
                <p>when we review the internal and external evidence of the authenticity of thefe
                    ſacred books, we cannot for a moment hefitate to receive them as the genuine <hi
                        rend="italic"> word oſ God.</hi> If we examine their internal character,
                    they everywhere appear to be indeed the voice of Heaven. The creation of the
                    world—-the manner in which this globe was ſirſt peopled—the deluge which ſwept
                    away its inhabitants—the ſucceeding views of the ſtate of mankind in the next
                    ages after the deluge—the calling of Abraham—the legiſlation of Moſes—the whole
                    fe-ries of events which befel the Jewiſh nation—the prophecies—the appearance of
                    Jeſus Chriſt, and the promulgation of his goſpel, as explained to us in the
                    Scrip-tureβ—form one ſeries, which is, in the higheſt degree, illuſtrative of
                    the power, wiſdom, and goodnefs of the Supreme Being.</p>
                <p>while it muſt be allowed that the human mind is ever prone to debate the ſublime
                    principles of true religion by enthuſiaſm and ſnperſtition, reaſon and can-dour
                    will not for a moment heſitate to acknowledge, that the whole ſyſtem of
                    revelation repretents the Supreme Being in the moſt fublime and amiable light :
                    that, in it, religion appears effentially connected with morality : that the
                    legiilative code of Motes was ſuch as no legiſ-lator ever formed and eſtabliſhed
                    among a people e-qually rude and uncultivated : that the manners and morals of
                    the Jews, vicious and ſavage as they may in ſome inſtances appear, yet merit a
                    much higher character than thoſe either of their neighbours, or of almoſt any
                    other nation, whofe circumſtances and character were in other reſpects ſimilar
                    to theirs : that there is an infinite difference between the Scripture
                    prophecies and the oracles and predictions which prevailed among hea-then
                    nations : and that the miracles recorded in thofe writings which we eſteem
                    ſacred were attended with circumſtances which entitle them to be ranked in a
                    very</p>

                <p>different claſs from thoſe which enthufiafm and impoſ-ture have fabricated among
                    other nations. See Mira-cle and Prophecy.</p>
                <p>But as the evidence of the divine origin of the prirnse-val religion reſts
                    particularly on the authority of the firſt five books of the old Teſtament, it
                    may be thought incumbent on us to ſupport our reaſoning on this ſubject, by
                    proving, that the author of thoſe books was indeed inſpired by God. This we
                    ſhall endeavour to do by one decifive argument ; for the nature of the ar-ticle,
                    and the limits preſcribed us, admit not of our en-tering into a minute detail of
                    all that has been written on the divine legation of Moſes.</p>
                <p>If the miracles recorded in the book of Exodus, and the other writings of the
                    Hebrew lawgiver, were really performed ; if the ſirſt-born of the Egyptians were
                    all cut off in one night, as is there related ; and if the children of Iſrael
                    paſſed through the Red fea, the waters being divided, and forming a wall on
                    their right hand and on their left—it muſt neceffarily be granted, that Moſes
                    was ſent by God ; becauſe nothing leſs than a divine power was ſufficient to
                    perform ſuch wonderful works. But he who ſuppoſes that thoſe works were never
                    performed, muſt affirm that the books recording them were <hi rend="italic">forged,</hi> either at the era in which the miracles are ſaid to have been
                    wrought, or at ſome ſubſequent era : There is no other alternative.</p>
                <p>That they could not be <hi rend="italic">forged</hi> at the era in which they
                    affirm the miracles to have been wrought, a very few reflections will make
                    incontrovertibly evident. Theſe books inform the people forwhoſe uſe they were
                    written, that their author, after having inflicted various plagues upon Pharaoh
                    and his ſubjects, brought them, to the number of 600,coo, out of Egypt with a
                    high hand ; that they were led by a pillar of cloud through the day, and by a
                    pillar of fire through the night, to the brink of the Red fea, where they were
                    almoſt overtaken by the Egyptians, who had purſued them with chariots and horſes
                    ; that, to make a way for their eſcape, Mofes ſtretchcd out'his rod over the
                    ſea, which was immediately divided, and permitted them to paſs through on dry
                    ground, between two walls of water ; and that the E-gyptians, purfuing and going
                    in after them to the midſt of the ſea, were all drowned by the return of the
                    waterε to their uſual ſtate, as ſoon as the Hebrews arrived at the further
                    ſhore. Is it poſſible now that Moſes or any other man could have perſuaded
                    600,000 perſons, however barbarous and illiterate we ſuppoſe them, that they had
                    been witneffes of all theſe wonderful works, if no ſuch works had been performed
                    ? Could any art or elo-quence perſuade all the inhabitants of Edinburgh- and
                    Leith, that, they had ycſterday walked on dry ground through the Frith to
                    Kinghorn, the waters being di-vided and forming a wall on their right hand and
                    on their left ? If this queſtion muſt be anſwered in the negative, it is
                    abſolutely impoſſible that the books of Moſes, ſup-poſing them to have been
                    forged, could have been re-ceived by the people who were alive when thoſe
                    won-ders are ſaid to have becn wrought.</p>
                <p>Let us now inquire, whether, if they be forgeries, they could have been received
                    as authentic at any ſub-ſequent period ; and we ſhall ſoon find this ſuppoſition
                    as impoſſible as the former. The books claiming Moſes for their author fpeak of
                    themfelves as delivered by him, and from his days kept in the ark.of the
                        covenant<note anchored="true" place="margin" type="authorial" n="2">Deut.
                        xxxi. 14-27.</note>; an</p>
                <p>ark which, upon this ſuppofition, had no exiſtence prior to the forgery. They
                    ſpeak of themſelves likewiſe, not only as. a hiſtory of miracles wrought by
                    their author, but as the ſtatutes or municipal law of the nation, of which a
                    copy was to be always in the poſſeſſion of the prieſts, and another in that of
                    the ſupreme magiſtrate<note anchored="true" place="margin" type="authorial"
                        n="3">Deut. xviii. 19.</note>. Now, in whatever age we ſuppoſe theſe books
                    to have been forged, they could not poffibly be received as au-thentic ; becauſe
                    no copy of them could then be found' either with the king, with the prieſts, or
                    in the ark, though, as they contain the ſtatute law of the land, it is not
                    conceivable that, if they had exiſted, they could have been kept ſecret. Could
                    any man, at this day, forge a book of ſtatutes for England or Scotland, and make
                    it paſs upon theſe nations for the only book of ſtatutes which they had ever
                    known ? was there ever ſince the world began a book of ſham ſtatutes, and theſe,
                    too, multifarious and burdenſome, impoſed upon any people as the only ſtatutes
                    by which they and their farthers had been governed for ages ? Such a forgery is
                    evidently impoſſible.</p>
                <p>But the books of Moſes have internal proofs of authenticity, which no other
                    books of ancient ſtatutes ever had. They not only contain the laws, but alſo
                    give an hiſtorical aecount of their enactment, and the reaſons upon which they
                    were founded. Thus they tell us<note anchored="true" place="margin"
                        type="authorial" n="4">Gen. xvii.</note>, that the rite of circumciſion was
                    inſtituted as a mark of the covenant between God and the founder of the Jewiſh
                    nation, and that the practice of it was enforced by the declaration of the
                    Almighty, that every uncircumcifed man-child ſhould be cut off from his people.
                    They in-form us that the annual ſolemnity of the paffover waβ inſtituted in
                    commemoration of their deliverance when God flew, in one night, all the
                    firſt-born of the Egyp-tians ; that the firſt-born of Iſrael, both of men and
                    beaſt, were on the fame occaſion dedicated ſor ever to God, who took the Levites
                    inſtead of the firſt-born of the men<note anchored="true" place="margin"
                        type="authorial" n="5">Exod. xii. and Numb. viii.</note>; that this tribe
                    was conſecrated as prieſts, by whoſe hands alone the ſacrifices of the people
                    were to be offered ; that it was death for any perſon of a different tribe to
                    approach the altar, or even to touch the ark of the covenant ; and that Aaron’s
                    budding rod was kept in the ark in memory of the wonderful deſtruction of Korah,
                    Dathan, and Abiram, for their rebellion a-gainſt the prieſthood.</p>
                <p>Is it poſſible now, if all thefe things hadnot been practiſed among the Hebrews
                    from the era of Moſes, with a retroſpect to the ſignal mercies which they are
                    ſaid to commemorate, that any man or body of men could have perſuaded a whole
                    nation, by means of forged books, that they had always religiouſly obſerved ſuch
                    inſtitutions ? Could it have been poſſible, at any period poſterior to the
                    Exodus, to perſuade the Iſraelites that they and their fathers had all been
                    circumciſed on the eighth day from their birth, if they had been confcious
                    themfelves that they had never been circumciſed at all? or that the paffover was
                    kept in memory of their deliverance from Egyptian bondage, if no ſuch feſtival
                    was known among them ?</p>
                <p>But let us ſuppoſe that circumciſion had been practiſed, and all their ether
                    ritcs and ceremonies obſerved from time immemorial, without their knowing any
                    reaſon of fuch inſtitutions ; ſtill it muſt be confeſſed that the forger of
                    theſe books, if they <hi rend="italic">were</hi> forged, conſtructed his
                    narrative in ſuch a manner as that no man</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0064" facs="gri_33125011196389_0070.tif"/>
                <p>of common ſenſe could receive it as authentic. He ſays it was death to touch the
                    ark ! As ſuch an aſſertion was never heard oſ before, and as the ritual he was
                    endeavouring to make them eſteem ſacred was opprcſſively multifarious ; ſurely
                    ſome daring ſpirit would have ventured to put his veracity to the teſt by moving
                    the ark and even offering ſacrifices ; and ſuch a teſt would at once have
                    expofed the impoſture. The budding rod, too, and the hat of manna, which, though
                    long preferved, were never before heard of', muſt have produced inquiries that
                    could not fail to end in detection. Thefe books ſpeak likewiſe of weekly
                    ſabbaths, daily ſacrifices, a yearly expiation, and monthly feſtivals, all to be
                    kept in remembrance of great things particularly fpecified as done for the
                    nation at an early period of its exiſtence. If this was not the caſe, could the
                    forger of the books have perſuaded the people that it really was fo ? The
                    enlightened reaſoners of this nation would be offended were we to compare them
                    with the ancient Iſraelites ; but ſurely they will not ſay that we are partial
                    to that people, if we bring them to a level with the moſt ſavage tribes of the
                    Ruſſian empire, who profeſs Chriſtianity ? Now, were a book to be forged
                    containing an account of many ſtrange things done a thouſand years ago in
                    Siberia by an <hi rend="italic">Apollonius,</hi> or any other philoſopher or
                    hero, numbers of the barbarians inhabiting that country would, we doubt not,
                    give implicit credit to the <hi rend="italic">legend</hi> : But were the
                    author, in confirmation of his narrative, to affirm, that all the Siberians had
                    from that day to this kept ſacred the ſirſt day of the week in memory of his
                    hero ; that they had all been baptized or circumciſed in his name ; that in
                    their public judicatories they had fworn by his name, and upon that very book
                    which they had never feen before ; and that the very ſame book was their law and
                    their goſpel, by which for a thouſand years back the actions of the whole people
                    had been regulated—ſurely the groffeſt favage among them would reject with
                    contempt and indignation a forgery ſo palpable.</p>
                <p>If this reaſoning be concluſive, the books of Moſes muſt indubitably be
                    authentic, and he himſelf muſt have been inſpired by the ſpirit of God. But this
                    point being eſtabliſhed, the queſtion reſpecting the origin of the primaeval
                    religion is completely anfwered. The writer of the book of Genelis informs us,
                    that Adam and Noah received many revelations from the Author of their being, and
                    that their religion was founded on the principles of the pureſt theiſm. How it
                    degenerated among the greater part of their defcendants into the groſſeſt
                    idolatry, has been ſhown at large in another place. See Polytheism.</p>
                <p>II. Having thus anſwered the firſt queſtion propofed ſor diſcuſſion in the
                    preſent article, we now proceed to conſider the ſecond, and to inquire whether
                    and how far religious ſentiments have a tendency to injure or to pro-mote the
                    welfare of fociety ? This is a ſubject of the utmoſt importance ; and if we
                    prove ſucceſsful in our inquiries, we ſhall be enabled to determine whether the
                    governors of mankind ought carefully to ſupport religious eſtabliſhments, or
                    whether the philoſopher who calls himſelf a citizen of the world, and profeſſes
                    to feel the moſt eager deſire to promote the intereſts of his ſpecies, acts
                    conſiſtently when he labours to exterminate religion from among men.</p>
                <p>A celebrated French financier<note anchored="true" place="margin"
                        type="authorial" n="6"><hi rend="italic">M. Necher.</hi></note>, a man of
                    abilities and virtue, who has publiihed a book on the importance of religious
                    opinions, labours to ſhow that religious eſta-bliſhrnents are indiſpenſably
                    neceſſary for the maintenance of civil order., and demonſtrates how weak the
                    influence of political inſtitutions is on the morals of mankind ; but he refuſes
                    to review the hiſtory of paſt ages in order to diſcover how far religious
                    opinions have actually been injurious or beneficial to the welfare of ſociety ;
                    choo-ſing rather to content himſelf with the refult of a ſe« ries of
                    metaphyfical diſquifitions.</p>
                <p>We admire the ſpirit which induced a man who had ſpent a confiderable part of
                    his life -amid the hurry of public bufinefs, to become the ſtrenuous advocate of
                    re-ligion ; but we cannot help thinking that, notwithſtanding the eloquence, the
                    acuteneſs, and the knowledge of mankind which he has diſplayed, his refuſing to
                    admit the evidence of facts concerning the influence of reli-gion on ſociety may
                    poſſibly be regarded by its enemies as a tacit acknowledgment that the evidence
                    of facts would be unfavourable to the cauſe which he wiſhes to defend. The
                    fallacy of general reaſonſhgs, and the inutility of metaphyfics for the purpoſes
                    of life, are ſo uni-verſally acknowledged, that they have long been the theme of
                    declamation. Though the abuſes oſ religion, as well as the abuſes of reaſon, the
                    perverſion oi any of the principles of the human mind, and the miſap-plication
                    of the gifts of providence, may have often produced effects hurtful to the
                    virtue and the happineſs of mankind ; yet, after tracing religion to a divine
                    ori-gin, we cannot, for a moment, allow ourſelves to think that the primary
                    tendency of religion muſt be hoſtile to the intereſts of ſocicty, or that it is
                    neceſſary to view it abſtractly in order that we may not behold it in an odious
                    light, often has the fceptic attacked religion with artful malice ; but perhaps
                    none of his attacks has been ſo ſkilfully directed as that which has firſt
                    ridiculed the abſurdity of the moſt abſurd ſuperſtitions, and afterwards
                    laboured to prove that the moſt abfurd ſyſtem of polytheiſm is more favourable
                    to the intereſts of ſociety than the pureſt and moſt ſublime theiſm. In-ftances
                    in which the abuſe of religion had tended to deprave the human heart, and had
                    led to the moſt ſhocking crimes, have been aſſiduouſly collected, and diſplayed
                    in all the aggravating colours in which elo-quence could array them, till at
                    length even the friends of true religion have been abaſhed ; and it has become a
                    faſhionable opinion, that nothing but ſelf-intereſt or bigotry can prompt men to
                    repreſent religion as the friend of civil order. But let us try if, by a candid
                    conſideration of what effects have reſulted to ſociety from religious
                    principles, in general, without compa-ring theſe with regard to truth or
                    falſehood, we can</p>
                <p>advance any thing to vindicate the character of religion.</p>
                <p>Notions of Deity in general, of various orders of divinities, of their moral
                    character, of their influence on human life, of a future ſtate, and of the
                    immortality of the human foul, conſtitute the leading articles of religion. Let
                    us view thefe together with the rites to which they have given jiſe ; and we may
                    perhaps be enabled to form fome well-grounded notions on this important point.</p>
                <p>I. Having proved that the firſt religious principles entertained by men were
                    derived from revelation, it is impoffible to ſuppoſe that they could produce
                    effects in-</p>

                <p>jurions to ſociety. If religion oſ any kind has ever Ieſſened the virtue or
                    diſturbed the peace oſ men, it muſt have been that religion which ſprings from a
                    belief in a multitude of ſuperior powers actuated by paf-fιons, and of whom fome
                    were conceived as benevolent and others as malicious beings. That fuch
                    ſentiments ſhould have produced vices unknown in ſocieties where pure theiſm is
                    profeſſed, will be readily admitted. Even the few <hi rend="italic">atheifis</hi> who live in Chriſtian or Mahometan countries are reſtrained by the laws,
                    by a deſire to promote the honour of the ſect, and by many other confiderations,
                    from indulging in practices which the ex-ample of the falſe gods of antiquity
                    ſanctioned in their votaries. But in determining the preſent queſtion, we muſt
                    not compare the virtues of the pagan world with thoſe of individual atheiſts in
                    modern Europe, but with thoſe of <hi rend="italic">nations</hi> profeſſing
                    atheiſm ; and ſuch nations are nowhere to be found. We can however eaſily
                    conceive, that in a ſociety unawed by any notions of God or a future ſtate, no
                    ſuch laws would be enacted as thoſe which reſtrain the ſenſual appetites ; of
                    which the criminal indulgence was one of the greateſt ſtigmas on the pagan
                    worſhip of antiquity. In ſuch ſocieties, therefore, thoſe vices would be
                    practiſed conſtantly to which paganiſm gave only an occaſional ſanction ; and
                    many others, in ſpite of the utmoſt vigilance of human Iaws, would be
                    perpetrated in ſecret, which the moſt profligate pagans viewed with horror.
                    Conſcience, though acting with all her energy, would not be able to command any
                    regard to the laws of morality : No virtue would be known ; focial order would
                    be nowhere obſerved; the midnight aſſaffin would every where be found ; and in
                    the general ſcramble mankind would be exterminated from the face of the earth.</p>
                <p>The worſt ſpecies of paganifm, even that which pre-vails among ſavages who
                    worſhip evil ſpirits, affords greater ſecurity than this. It is indeed ſhocking
                    to think that demons ſhould be Worſhipped, while deities, who are regarded as
                    being all benevolence, are treated with contempt: And it has been aſked, If the
                    influence of ſuch religious ſentiments on the moral practice of the idolaters
                    muſt not naturally be, to cauſe them to treat their friends and benefactors with
                    ingratitude, and to humble themſelves with mean ſubmiſſion before a powerful
                    enemy ?</p>
                <p>They do not appear to have produced ſuch effects on the morality of the ſavages
                    by whom they were entertained. The benevolent deities were neglected, only
                    becauſe their benevolence was neceſſary. A voluntary iavour merits a grateful
                    return : a deſigned injury provokes reſentment. But when you become, by
                    accident, the inſtrument of any man’s good fortune, the world will ſcarce
                    conſider him as owing you any obligation : the ſtone which bruiſes your foot
                    excites only a momentary emotion of reſentment. Thoſe gods who could not avoid
                    doing good to men might not receive a pro-fuſion of thanks for their ſervices ;
                    and yet a favohr conferred by an human benefactor commands the warm-eft
                    gratitude. But thoſe rude tribes appear to have had fo much wiſdom âs to confer
                    a lefs abſolute malice on their malcvolent deities, than the benevolence which
                    -they attributed to their more amiable order of ſuperior beings : though the
                    latter could not poffibly do them any thing but good, and that conſtantly ; yet
                    the former were not under an equally indifpenſable neceffity of perſevering in
                    depreſſing them under calamities. On their malevoIent deities they conferred a
                    freedom of agency which they denied to the benevolent. No won-der, then, that
                    they were more afliduous in paying their court to the one than to the other.
                    They might with as much propriety have thought of being grateful to the boar or
                    ſtag whoſe fleſh fupported them, as to deities who were always benevolent,
                    becaufe they could not poſſibly be otherwiſe. Though negligent of ſuch.
                    deitiete, this can ſcarce be thought to have had any ten» dency to render them
                    ungrateful to benefactors like themfelves. And yet, it muſt not be diſſembled,
                    thafc the American Indians, among whom ſuch religion» ſentiments have been found
                    to prevail, are ſaid to be very little ſenſible to the emotions of gratitude.
                    Ait Indian receives a preſent without thinking of making any grateful
                    acknowledgments to the beſtower. He pleaſes his fancy or gratifies his appetite
                    with what you have givcn, without feeming to conſider himſeif as under the
                    ſmalleſt obligation to you for the gift.</p>
                <p>Tt may be doubted, however, whether this ſpirit of ingratitude originates from,
                    or is only collateral with, that indifference which refuſes adoration and
                    worſhip to the benevolent divinities. If the former be actually the cafe, we
                    muſt acknowledge that thoſe religious notion's which we now conſider, though
                    preferable to general atheiſm, are in this reſpect unfriendly to virtue. But if
                    the Indians may be thought to owe the ingratitude for which they are
                    diſtinguiſhed to the opinion which they entertain of the exiſtence of a
                    benevolent order of deities, whofe benevolence is neceffary and involuntary,
                    their ideas of the nature of their malevolent demons do not appear to have
                    produced equal effects on their moral ſentiments. However ſubmiffive to thoſe
                    dreaded beings, they are far from ſhowing the fame tame and cowardly fubmiſſion
                    to their human enemies : towards them they ſeem rather to adopt the ſentiments
                    of their demons. Inveterate rancour and brutal fury, inhuman cruelty and
                    inconceivable cunning, are diſplayed in the hoſtilities of tribes at war ; and
                    we know not, after all, if even theſe ſentiments do not owe ſomewhat of their
                    force to the influence of religion.</p>
                <p>Yet let us remember that thefe fame Indians have not been always repreſented in
                    ſo unamiable a light ; or, at leaſt, other qualities have been aſcribed to them
                    which ſeem to be inconſiſtent with thoſe barbarous diſpoſitions. They have been
                    deſcribed as peculiarly ſuſceptible of conjugal and parental love; and he who is
                    ſo cannot be deſtitute of virtue.</p>
                <p>2. But leaving the religion of ſavages, of which very little is known with
                    certainty, let us proceed to examine what is the natural influence of that mixed
                    ſyſtem of theology which repreſents to the imagination of men a number of
                    fuperior and inferior divinities, actuated by the fame paſſions and feelings
                    with themſelves, and often making uſe of their ſuperior power and knowledge for
                    no other purpoſe but to enable them to violate the laws of moral order with
                    impunity. This is the cele-brated polytheiſm of the Greeks and Romans, and moſt
                    other nations of antiquity (ſee Polytheisλm). Could its influence be favourable
                    to virtue ?</p>
                <p>At a firil view every perſon will readily declare, that ſuch a ſyſtem muſt have
                    been friendly to profligacy. If you commit the government of the univerſe, and
                    the inſpection of human ſociety, to a ſct of beings who are</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0066" facs="gri_33125011196389_0072.tif"/>
                <p>often diſpoſed to regard vice with a no leſs favourable eye than virtue, and
                    who, though there be an eſtabliſhed order by which virtue is diſcriminated from
                    vice, and right from wrong, yet ſcruple not to violate that order in their own
                    conduct ; you cannot expect: them to require in you a degree of rectitude of
                    which they themſelves appear incapable. A Mercury will not diſ-courage the
                    thieviſh arts of the trader ; a Bacchus and a venus cannot frown upon debauchery
                    ; Mars will behold with ſavage delight all the cruelties of war. The Thracians
                    indeed, one of the moſt barbarous nations of antiquity, whoſe ferocity was
                    little if at all inferior to that of the Indians who have been diſtinguiſhed as
                    ca-nibals, was the favourite nation of Mars ; among whom ſtood his palace, to
                    whieh he repaired when about to mount his chariot, and arm himſelf for battle.
                    Even Jupiter, who had been guilty of ſo many acts of tyrannical caprice, had
                    been engaged in fuch a multitude of amorous intrigues, and ſeemed to owe his
                    elevated ſtation as monarch of the ſky, not to fuperior goodnefs or wifdom, but
                    merely to a ſuperior degree of brutal force, could not be feared as the avenger
                    of crimes, or revered as the impartial rewarder of virtues.</p>
                <p>That this ſyſtem had a pernicious effect on morals, and that, as compared
                    with.pure theiſm, it was injurious to ſociety, cannot be denied ; but yet, when
                    contraſted with atheiſm, it was not without its favourable effects. It was ſo
                    connected with the order of fociety, that, without its ſupport, that order could
                    fcarce have been maintained. The young rake might perhaps juſtify himſelf by the
                    example of Jupiter, or Apollo, or ſome other amorous divinity ; the frail virgin
                    or matron might complain of Cupid, or boaſt of imitating venus ; and the thief
                    might practiſe his craft under the patronage of Mercury : But if we take the
                    whole fyſtem together, if we conſider with what views thoſe deities were
                    publicly worſhipped, what temples were raiſed, wlιat rites inſtituted, what
                    ſacrifices offered, and what <hi rend="italic">feri&lt;ε</hi> conſecrated
                    ; we ſhall perhaps find it neeeffary to acknowledge that the general effects
                    even of that mixed and incoherent ſyftem of polytheiſm whieh prevailed among the
                    Greeks and Romans were favourable to fociety. To ſtate a particular inſtance ;
                    the <hi rend="italic">ancilia</hi> of Mars and the fire of Veſta were thought
                    to ſecure the perpetuity of the Roman empire. As long as the ſacred <hi
                        rend="italic"> andle,</hi> which had been dropped from heaven for that
                    benevolent purpoſe, was ſafely preſerved in thoſe holy archives in which it had
                    been depoſited ; and as long as the ſacred fire of Veſta was kept burning,
                    without being once extinguiſhed, or at leaſt ſuffered to remain for an inſtant
                    in that ſtate ; fo long was Rome to ſubſiſt and flouriſh. And, however ſimple
                    and abfurd the idea which connected the profperity of a nation with the
                    preſervation of a piece of wood in a certain place, or with the conſtant blazing
                    of a flame upon an hearth ; yet no fact can be more certain, than that the
                    patriotifm and enthuſiaſtic valour of the Romans, which we ſo much extol and
                    admire, were, in many inſtances, owing in no inconfiderable degree to the
                    veneration which they entertained for the <hi rend="italic">ancilia</hi> and
                    the veſtal ſire.</p>
                <p>A numerous ſeries of facts occur in the Roman, hiſtory, which ſhow the happy
                    effects of their religious: opinions and ceremonies on their ſentiments
                    concerning ſocial order and the public welfare. How powerful</p>
                <p>was the influence of the <hi rend="italic">ſacramentum</hi> adminiſtered to
                    the ſoldiers when they enliſted in the ſervice of their country ? The promiſes
                    made, the idea of the powers invoked, and the rites performed on that occaſion,
                    pro-duced ſo deep and ſo awful an impreffion on their minds, that no danger, nor
                    diſtreſs, nor difcontent, could prompt thcm to violate their engagements. The
                    re-ſponſes of the oracles, too, thougſh the dictates of deceit and impoſture,
                    were often of ſingular ſervice to thoſe to whom they were uttered ; when they
                    inſpiretj the warrior, as he marched out to battle, with the con-fide∏ce of
                    fucceſs, they communicated to him new vi-gour <hi rend="sub">i</hi> and more
                    heroic valour, by which he was actu-ally enabled to gain, or at leaſt to
                    deſerve, the fucceſs which they prornifed. Again, when in times of pub. lic
                    diſtrefs, the augur and the prieſt directed ſome games to be celebrated, certain
                    facriſices to be offered, or ſome other ſolemnities to be performed, in order to
                    appeaſe tbe wrath of the offended deities ; it is plain that the means were not
                    at all ſuited to accompliſh the end pro-poſed by them ; yet ſtill they were
                    highly bénéficiai* when the attention of the whole people was turned en-tirely
                    to thoſe ſolemnities by which the wrath of hea-ven was to be averted, they were
                    rouſed from that de-fpondency under which the ſenſe of the public diſtrei’s or
                    danger might have otherwiſe cauſed them to ſink : the public union was at the
                    ſame time more cloſely cemented, and the hearts of the people knit together ;
                    and when perſuaded, that by propitiating the gods they had removed the cauſe of
                    their diſtreſs, they acquired ſuch calmneſs and ſtrength of mind as enabled them
                    to take more direct and proper meaſures for the fofetyof the ſtate.</p>
                <p>Could we view the ancient Greeks and Romans acting in public or in private life
                    under the influence of that ſyſtem of ſuperſtition which prevailed among them ;
                    could we perceive how much it contributed to the maintenance of civil order;
                    could we behold Numa and Lycurgus eſtabliſhing their laws, which would otherwiſe
                    have met with a very different reception under the fonction of divinities ;
                    could we obſerve all the beneficial effects which aroſe to communities from the
                    ce-lebration of religious ceremonies - we ſhould no longer hefitate to
                    acknowledge, that thofe principles in the hu-man heart by which we are
                    fuceptible <hi rend="sup">,</hi> of religious fentiments, are ſo eminently
                    calculated to promote the hap-pineſs of mankind, that even when· perverted and
                    abuſed, their influence is ſtill favourable.</p>
                <p>The ideas which prevailed among the nations of the heathen world concerning a
                    future ſtate of retribution were, it muſt be confeffed,. not very correct. Some
                    of the poets, we believe, have repreſented them in no unfair light : both Homer
                    and virgil have conducted their heroes through the realms of Pluto, and have
                    taken occaſion to unfold to us the ſecrets of thoſe dreary abodes-The ſcenes are
                    wild and fanciful ; the rewards of the juſt and virtuous are of no very reſined
                    or dignified nature : and of the puniſhments- inflicted on. the guilty, it. is
                    often hard to ſay for what ends they could be inflicted ; whether to correct and
                    improve, or for the gratification of revenge or whim : they are often ſo
                    whim-ſical and unfuitable, that they cannot with any degree of propriety be
                    afcribed to any cauſe but blind chance or wanton caprice. A great dog with three
                    tongues, a peevilh old boat-man with a. leaky ferry-boat, de-</p>

                <p>mnndhig his freight in a furly tone, and an uxorious monarch, are objects too
                    familiar and ludicrous not to degrade the dignity of thoſe awful ſcenes which
                    are repreſented as the manſions of the dead, and to prevent them from making a
                    deep enough impreffion on the imagination. The actions and qualities, too, for
                    which departed fpirits were admitted into Elyſium, or doomed to the regions of
                    fijſſering, were not always of ſuch a nature as under a well-regulated
                    government on earth would have been thought to merit reward, or to be worthy of
                    puniſhment. It was not always virtue or wiſdom which conducted to the Elyſian
                    fields, or gained admiſſion into the fociety of the immortal gods.— Ganimede was
                    for a very different reaſon promoted to be the cup-bearer oſ Jove ; and Hercules
                    and Bacchus could not finely plead that any merits of that kind entitled them to
                    feats in the council, and at the banquets of the immortals. That doctrine,
                    likewife, which repreſented mortals ns hurried by fate to the commiſſion of
                    crimes, which they could no more abſtain from committing than the ſword can
                    avoid to obey the impulſe of a powerful and furious arm plunging it into the
                    breaſt of an unreſiſting antagυnift, could not but produce effects unfavourable
                    to virtue ; and it afforded a ready excuſe for the moſt extravagant crimes.</p>
                <p>Ύ ct, after all, he who attentively conſiders the ideas of the Greeks and Romans
                    concerning the moral government of the world and a future ſtate of rewards and
                    puniſhments, will probably acknowledge, that their general influence muſt have
                    been favourable to virtue and moral order. Allow them to have been incorrect and
                    daſhed with abſurdity ; ſtill they repreſent puniſhments prepared for ſuch
                    qualities and actions as were injurious to the welfare of ſociety ; whilſt, for
                    thoſe qualities which rendered men eminently ufefùl in the world, they hold
                    forth a reward. Though incorrect, their ideas concerning a future ſtate were
                    exceedingly diſtinct ; they were not vague or general, but ſuch as might be
                    readi-Iy conceived by the imagination, in all their circumftances, as really
                    exiſting. when a man is told that for ſuch a deed he will be put to death, he
                    may ſhud--&lt;ier and be alarmed, and think of the deed as what he jrtuſt by
                    no means commit ; but place before him the ſcene and the apparatus for his
                    execution, call him to behold ſome other criminal mounting the ſcaffold,
                    ad-βheffing his laſt words in a wild ſcream of defpair to the ſurrounding
                    ſpectators, and then launching into eternity—his horror of the crime, and his
                    dread of the puniſhment, will now be much more powerfully excited. In the ſame
                    manner, to encourage the ſoldier marching cut te battle, or the mariner fetting
                    ſail under the proſpect of a ſtorm, promiſ¢ not, merely in general terms, a
                    liberal reward ; be ſure to ſpecify the nature of the reward which you mean to
                    beſtow; deſcribe it ſo as that it may take hold on the imagination, and may riſe
                    in oppoſition to the images of death and danger with which his courage is to be
                    aſſailed.</p>
                <p>If thefe phenomena of die human mind are fairly ftated, if it be true that
                    general ideas produce no very powerful effects oa the fentimentβ and
                    diſpoſitions of the human heart, it muſt then be granted, that though the ſcenes
                    of future reward and puniſhment, which the heathens conſidered as prepared for
                    the righteous and the wicked, were of a ſomewhat motley complexion ; yet ſtill,
                    as they were diſtinct and even minute draughts,</p>
                <p>they muſt have been favbtιrable to virtue, and contribu-ted in no inconfiderable
                    degree to the fupport of civil order.</p>
                <p>Another thing of which we may take notice under this head, is the vaſt
                    multiplicity of deities with which the Greek and Roman mythology peopled all the <hi rend="italic">regions</hi> of nature. Flocks and fields, and woods and
                    oaks, and flowers, and many much more minute objects, had all their guardian
                    deities. Tlieſe were ſomewhat capricious at times, it is true, and expected to
                    have attention paid them. But yet the faithful ſhepherd, and the induſtrious
                    farmer, knew generally how to acquire their friendſhip ; and in the idea of
                    deities enjoying the ſame ſimple pleaſures, partaking in the ſame labours,
                    protecting their poſſeſſions, and bringing forward the fruits of the year, there
                    could not but be fomething of a very pleating nature, highly favourable to
                    induſtry, which would animate the labours, and cheer the feſtivals, of the good
                    people who entertained ſuch a notion ; nay, would diſſuſe a new charm over all
                    the fcene6 of the country, even in the gayeſt months of the year.</p>
                <p>From all of theſe particular obfervations, we think ourſelves warranted to
                    conclude, that notwithſtanding the mixed characters of the deities who were
                    adored by the celebrated nations of antiquity ; though they are in many
                    inſtances repreſented as conſpicuous for vices and frolics ; however vain,
                    abfurd, and morally criminal, ſome of the rites by which they were worſhipped
                    may have been, and however incorrect the notions of the heathens concerning the
                    moral government of the univerſe and a future ſtate of retribution ; yet ſtill,
                    after making a juſt allowance for all theſe imperfections, the general influence
                    of their religious ſyſtem was rather favourable thaπ unfavourable to virtue and
                    to the order and happineſs of fociety.</p>
                <p>It was not without good reaſon that the earlieſt legiſlators generally
                    endeavoured to eſtabliſh their laws and conſtitutions on the baſis of religion ;
                    government needs the ſupport of opinion ; the governed muſt be im-preſſed with a
                    belief that the particular eſtabliſhment to whieh they are required to ſubmit,
                    is tbe beſt calculated for their ſecurity and happineſs, or is ſupported on ſome
                    ſuch ſolid foundation, that it muſt prove,im-poſſible for them to overturn it,
                    or is connected with ſome awful ſanction, which it would hc the moſt heinous
                    impiety to oppoſe. Οί thefe feveral notions, the laſt will ever operate on moſt
                    men with the moſt ſteady influence. AVe are frequently blind to our own intereſt
                    ; even when eager for the attainment of happineſs, we often refuſc to take the
                    wiſeſt meaſures for that end. The great bulk of the people in every community
                    are ſo little capable of reafoning and foreſight, that the public miniſter who
                    ſhall moſt ſteadily direct his views to the public good will often be the moſt
                    unpopular. Thoſe laws, and that ſyſtem of government, which arc the moſt
                    beneficial, will often excite the ſtrongeſt popular diſcontents. Again, it is
                    not always eaſy to perſuade people that your power is ſuperior to theirs, when
                    it is not really fo. No one man will ever be able to perſuade a thouſand that he
                    is ſtronger than they all together ; and therefore, in order to perſuade one
                    part of his fub-jects or army that it is abſolutely neceſſary for them to ſubmit
                    to him, becauſe any attempts to reſiſt his power</p>
                <p>would prove ineffectual, a monarch or general muſt take care ſirſt to perſuade
                    another part that it is ſor their in-</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0068" facs="gri_33125011196389_0074.tif"/>
                <p>tertſt to ſubmit to him : or to iιnprefs the whole with a belief that, weak and
                    pitiful as he himielf may appear, when viewed ſingly in oppoſition to them all,
                    yet by tbe aſſiſtance of ſome awful inviſible beings, his friends and
                    protectors, he is ſo powerful, that any attempts to reſiſt his authority muſt
                    prove preſumptuous folly. Here, then, the aid of religion becomes requiſite.
                    Religious fentiments are the moſt happily calculated to ſerve this purpofe.
                    Scarce ever was there a ſociety formed, a inode of government eſtabliihed, or a
                    code oi laws framed and enacted, without having the religious fentiments of
                    mankind, their notions of the exiſtence of fuperior invιhble beings, and their
                    hopes and fears from thoſe beings, as its fundamental principle. Now, we
                    believe, it is almoſt univerſally agreed, that even the rndeſt form of ſociety
                    is more favourable to the happineſs of mankind, and the dignity ot the human
                    character, than a ſolitary and lavage ſtate.. And if this, with what we have
                    afferted concerning religion as the baſis of civil government, be both granted,
                    it will follow, that even the moſt imperfect religious notions, the moſt fooliih
                    and abſurd rites, and the wildeſt ideas that have been entertained concerning
                    the moral government of the univerſe by ſuperior beings, and a future ſtate of
                    retribution, have been more advantageous than atheιfm to the happinefs and
                    virtue of human life, we have already granted, nor can it be denied, indeed,
                    that many of the religious opinions which prevailed among the ancient heathens,
                    did contribute, in ſome degree, to the depravation of their morals : and' all
                    that we argue tor is, that on a comparative view oi the evil and the good which
                    reſulted from them, the latter muſt appear more than adequate to counterbalance
                    the effects of the former.</p>
                <p>But if ſuch be the natural tendency of thoſe principles by which the human heart
                    is made ſuſceptible of re=∙ ligious fentiments, that even enthuſiaſm and abſurd
                    ſuperſtition are productive of beneficial teffects more than iufficient to
                    counterbalance whatever is malignant in their influence on ſociety finely a pure
                    rational religion, the doctrines of which are founded in undeniable truth, and
                    all the obfervances which it enjoins, calculated to promote by their direct and
                    immediate effects ſome uſeful purpoſes, muſt be in a very high degree conducive
                    to the dignity and the happineſs of human nature. Indeed one collateral prooſ ol
                    the truth of any religion, which muſt have very conſiderable weight with all who
                    are not of opinion that the ſyſtem of the univerſe has been produced and
                    hitherto maintained in order and exiſtence by blind chance, will be its having a
                    ſtronger and more direct tendency than others to promote the intereſts of moral
                    virtue and the happineſs of mankind in the preſent life. Even the teſtimony of
                    thoufands, even miracles, prophecies, and the lanction of remote antiquity, will
                    ſcarce have ſuſſicient weight to perfiιade us, that a religion is of divine
                    origin, it its general tendency appear to be rather unfavourable than
                    advantageous to moral virtue.</p>
                <p>III. We ſſiall therefore, in the next place, endeavour to determine, from a
                    comparative view of the effects produced on the character and circumſtances of
                    fociety by the moſt eminent of theſe various ſyſtems of religion which have been
                    in different ages or in different countries eſtabliſſied in the world, how far
                    any cne of them has in this reſpect the advantage over the yeſt <hi
                        rend="italic"> ; and,</hi> if the utility of a ſyſtem of religion were to</p>
                <p>be received as a teſt of its truth, what particular fyſtem might, with the beſt
                    reaſon, be received as true, while the reſt were rejected.</p>
                <p>iſt,. The principle upon which we here fet out is, that all, or almoft all,
                    fyſtems of religion with which we are acquainted, whether true or falfe,
                    contribute more or leſs to the welfare of fociety. But as, one field is more
                    fruitful, and one garden leſs overgrown with weeds than another; ſo, in the fame
                    manner, one ſyſtem of religious opinions and ceremonies may be more happily
                    calculated than others to promote the trueſt intereſts of mankind. In oppofition
                    to th∩fe philoſophers who are ſo vehement in their declamations againſt the
                    inequality of ranks, we have ever been of opinion, that refinement and
                    civilization contribute to the hap-pineſs of human life. The character of the
                    ſolitary ſavage is, we are told, more dignified and reſpectabte than that of the
                    philoſopher and the hero, in proportion as he is more independent. He is indeed
                    more independent ; but his independence is that of a ſtone, which receives no
                    nouriſhment from the earth or air, and communicates none to animals or
                    vegetables around it. In point of happineſs, and in point of reſpectability, we
                    cannot hefitate a moment, let philofophers fay what they will, to prefer a
                    virtu-ous <hi rend="sub">i</hi> enlightened, and poliſhed Briton to any of the
                    rudeſt ſavages, the leaſt acquainted with tbe reſtraints and the ſympathies of
                    ſocial life, that wander through the wild foreſts of the weſtern world. But if
                    we prefer civilization to barbariſm, we muſt admit, that in this view
                    Chriſtianity has the advantage over every other religious ſyſtem which has in
                    any age or country prevailed among men ; for nowhere has civilization and uſeful
                    ſcicnce been carried to ſuch a height as among Chriſtians.</p>
                <p>It is not, indeed, in any confiderable degree that the abſurd ſuperſtitions of
                    thole rude tribes, who can lcarce be laid to be formed into any regular ſociety,
                    can contribute to their happineſs. Among them the faculty ol reaſon is but in a
                    very low ſtate; and the moral principle uſually follows the improvement or the
                    depreſſion ol the reaſoning faculty. Their appetites and merely animal paſſions
                    are almoſt their only principles ot action : their firſt religious notions, if
                    we ſuppoſe them, not to be derived from revelation or tradition, are produced by
                    the operation of gratitude, or grief, or hope,, or fear, upon their
                    imaginations. And to theſe, however wild aud fanciful, it is not improbable that
                    they may owe fome of their earlieſt moral notions. The idea of ſuperior powers
                    naturally leads to the thought that thofe powers have ſome influence on human
                    life, from this they will moſt probably proceed to fancy one fet of actions
                    agreeable, another offenſive, to thoſe beings to whom they believe themſelves
                    ſubject. And this,, perhaps, is the ſirſt diſtinction that favages can be
                    ſup-pofed to form between actions, as right or wrong, to be performed or to be
                    avoided. But if this be the eaſe, we muſt acknowledge that the religious notions
                    of the ſavage, however abſurd, contribute to elevate his character, and to
                    improve his happineſs, when, they call forth the moral principle implanted in
                    his breaſt.</p>
                <p>But iſ the ſocial ſtate be preferable to a ſtate of wild, and ſolitary
                    independence, even the rude fuperſtitions of unenlightened tribes of favages are
                    in another reſpect beneficial to thole among whom they prevail. They</p>

                <p>uſually form, as has been already obferved under this article, the baſis of
                    civil order. Religious opinions may lead the great body of the community to
                    reverence ſome particular fet of inſtitutions, ſome individual, or ſome family,
                    which are repreſented to them as peculiarly connected with the gods whom they
                    adore. Under this ſanction ſome form of government is eſta-hliſhed ; they are
                    taught to perform ſocial duties, and rendered capable of ſocial enjoyments. Not
                    only Numa and Lycurgus, but almoſi every legiſlator who has fought to civilize a
                    rude people, and reduce them under the reſtraints of legal government, have
                    endeavoured to impreſs their people with an idea that they acted with the
                    approbation, and under the immediate direction, of ſuperior powers, we cannot
                    but allow that the rude ſuperſtitions of early ages are productive of theſe
                    advantages to ſociety ; but we have already acknowledged, and it cannot be
                    denied, that they are al-ſo attended with many unhappy effects, when we view the
                    abſurdities intermixed with the ſyſtems of religion which prevailed among moſt
                    of the nations of antiquity, we cannot help lamenting that ſo noble a principle
                    of human nature as our religious ſentiments ihould be liable to ſuch groſs
                    perverfιon ; and when we view the effects which they produce on the morals of
                    mankind, and the forms of ſociety, though we allow them to have been upon the
                    whole rather beneficial than hurtful, yet we cannot but obſerve, that their
                    unfavourable effects are by far more numerous than if they had been better
                    directed, what unhappy effects, for inſtance,· have been produced by falſe
                    notions concerning the condition of human ſouls in a future Rate, various
                    nations have imagined that the ſcenes and objects of the world of ſpirits are
                    only a ſhadow; repreſentation of the things of the prefent world. Not only the
                    fouls of men, according to them, inhabit thoſe regions ; all the inferior
                    animals and vegetables, and even inanimate bodies that are killed or deſtroyed
                    here, are ſuppofed to paſs into that vifionary world ; and, exiſting there in
                    unſubftantial forms, to execute the ſame functions, or feιve the ſame purpoſes,
                    as on earth. Such are the ideas of futurity that were entertained by the
                    inhabitants of Guinea. And by thefe ideas they were induced, when a king or
                    great man died among them, to provide for his comfortable accommodation in the
                    world • of ſpirits, by burying with him meat and drink ſor his fubſiſtence,
                    ſtaves to attend and ſerve him, and wives with whom he might ſtill enjoy the
                    pltaſures of love. His faithful ſubjects vied with each other in offering,</p>
                <p>one a ſervant, another a wife, a third a ſon or daughter, to be ſent to the
                    other world in company with the monarch, that they might there be employed in
                    his 'ſervice. In New Spain, in the iſland cf Java, in the kingdom of Benen, and
                    among the inhabitants of Is-doſtan, ſimilar practices on the ſame occaſion,
                    owing no doubt to ſimilar notions of futurity, have been prevalent. But fuch
                    practices as theſe cannot be viewed with greater contempt on account of the
                    opinions ■which have given riſe to them, than horror on account of their unhappy
                    effects on the condition of thole among whom they prevail. A lively impreffion
                    of the cnjoyments to be obtained in a future ftate, together with fome very
                    ſalfe or incorrect notions concerning the qualities or actions which were to
                    entitle the departing ſoul to admiſſion into the ſcene of thoſe enjoyments, is
                    ſaid to have produced equally ùnhappÿ effects among the Japaneſe. They not only
                    bribed their prieſts to ſolicit for them ; but looking upon the enjoyments of
                    the preſent life with diſguſt or contempt, they uſed to daſh themſelves from
                    precipices, or cut their throats, in order to get to paradſſe as ſoon as
                    poffible. Various other ſuperſtitions ſubſiſting among rude πa-tions might here
                    be enumerated, as inſtances of the perverſion of the religious principles of the
                    human heart, which render them injurious to virtue and happinefs. The
                    auſterities which have been practiſed, chiefly among rude nations, as means of
                    propitiating ſuperior powers, are eſpecially worthy of notice.— when the
                    favourite idol of the Banians is carried in folemn proceſſion, fome devotees
                    proſtrate themfelve‰ on the ground, that the chariot in which the idol is
                    carried may run over them ; others, with equal enthu-ſtaſm, daſh themſelves on
                    ſpikes faſtened on purpoſe to the car. Innumerable are tbe ways of torture which
                    have been invented and practiſed on themielves by men ignorantly ſtriving to
                    recommend themſelves to the favour of heaven. Theſe we lament as inſtances in
                    which religious ſentiments have been ſo ill directed by the in-ſluence of
                    imagination, and unenlightened erring reaſon, as to produce unfavourable effects
                    on the human character, and oppofe the happineſs of ſocial life.·— Though we
                    have argued, that even the moſt abſurd fy~ ſtems of religion that have prevailed
                    in the world, have been upon the whole rather beneficial than injurious t¢f the
                    dignity and happineſs of human nature ; yet if it ſtiall not appear, as we
                    proceed farther in our comparative view of the effects of religion on ſociety,
                    that others have been attended with happier effects than theie ſuperſtitions
                    which belong to the rude ages of ſociety, we may ſcarce venture to brand the
                    infidel with the ap-peliation of <hi rend="italic">fool,</hi> for refuſing to
                    give his affent to religious doctrines, or to act under their influence.</p>
                <p>2d, The polytheſſm of the Greeks and Romans,, and cither heathen nations in a
                    ſimilar ſtate oſ civilization, we have already conſidered as being, upon the
                    whole, rather favourable than unfavourable to virtue; but we muſt not partially
                    conceal its defects. The vicious characters of the deities which they
                    worſhipped, the incorrect notions which they entertained concerning the moral
                    government cf the univerſſe and a future re-tribution, the abſurdity of their
                    rites and ceremonies,, and the criminal practices which were intermixed with
                    them, muſt have altogether had a tendency to pervert both the reaſoning and the
                    moral principles of the human mind. The debaucheries of the monarch of the gods,
                    and the fdelity with which his example in that reſpect was followed by the whole
                    crowd of the inferior deities, did, we know, diſpoſe the devout heathen, when he
                    felt the ſame paſſions which had afferted thejr power over the gods, to gratify
                    them without ſcruple. It is a truth, however, and we will not attempt to deny or
                    conceal it, that tire genius of the polytheiſm of the Greeks and Romans was
                    friendly to the arts ; to ſuch of them eſpecially as are raifed to excellence by
                    the vi-goιous exertion of a fine imagination; muſic, poetry, ſeulpture,
                    architecture, and pa ntmg, all of theſe arts appear to have been confiderably
                    indebted for that perfection to whic∩ they attained, elpecially among the.
                    Greeks, to the fplendid and fanciful ſyſtem of mytholo-gy. which was received
                    among, that ingenious people. —</p>

                <p>Rut we cannot give an equally favourable account of its influence on the
                    ſei¢nces. There was little in that ſyſtem that could contribute to call forth
                    reaſon. AVe may grant indeed, that if reaſon can be ſo ſhocked with abſurdity as
                    to be rouled to a more vigorous exertion of her powers, and a more determined
                    affertion of her rights in conlequence of furveying it ; in that caſe this
                    ſyſtem of mythology might be favourable to the exer-¢iſe and improvement of
                    reaſon ; not otherwiſe.</p>
                <p>The connection of paganiſm with morality was too imperfect for it to produce any
                    very important effects on the morals of its votaries. Sacrifices and prayers,
                    and temples and feſtivals, not purity of heart and integrity of life, were the
                    means preſcribed for propitia-ting tlie favour of the deities adored by the
                    Pagans. There were other means, too, befides true heroiſm and patriotiſm, of
                    gaining admiſljon into the Elyfian fields, or obtaining a feat in tbe council of
                    the gods. Xenophon, in one of the moſt beautiful parts of his Memoirs of
                    Socrates, repreſeuts Hercules wooed by virtue and Pleaſure in two fair female
                    forms, and deliberating with much anxiety which of the two he ſhould prefer. But
                    this is the fiction of a philoſopher délirons to improve the fables of antiquity
                    in ſuch a way as to render them truly uſeful. Hercules does not appear, from tho
                    tales which are told us of his adventures, to have been at any ſuch pains in
                    choofing his way of life. He was received into the palace of Jove, without
                    having occaſion to plead that he had through life been the faithful follower of
                    that σoddefs to whom the philoſopher makes him give the preference ; his being
                    the ſon of Jove, and his wild adventures, were ſuſſicient without any other
                    merits to gain him that honour. The ſame may be ſaid concerning many of the
                    other demi-gods and heroes who were advanced to heaven, or conveyed to the
                    bleſs-.ful fields of Elyſium. And whatever might be the good effects of the
                    religion of Greece and Rome in <hi rend="italic">general</hi> upon the civil
                    and political eſtabliſhments, and in ſome few inſtances on the manners of the
                    people, yet ſtill it muſt be acknowledged to have been but ill calculated to
                    impreſs the heart with ſuch principles as might in all circumftanceε direct to a
                    firm, uniform, tenor of virtuous conduct.</p>
                <p>But after what has been ſaid on the character of this religion elſewhere (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Polytheism),</hi> and in the ſecond part of this
                    article, we cannot without repetition enlarge farther on it here, of the Jewiſh
                    religion, however, we have as yet ſaid little, having on purpoſe reſerved to
                    this place whatever we mean to in-troduce under the article, concerning its
                    influence on ſociety.</p>
                <p>3d, when we take a general view of the circumſtances in which the Jewilh
                    religion was eſtabliſhed, the effects which it produced on the character and
                    fortune of the nation, the rites and ceremonies which it enjoined, and the
                    ſingular political inſtitutions to which it gave a fonction, it may perhaps
                    appear hard to deter-mine, whether it were upon the whole more or leſs
                    beneficial to ſociety than the pυlytheifm of the Egyp. tians, Greeks, and
                    Romans. But if ſuch be the judgement which preconceived prejudices, or an haſty
                    and careleſs view, have induced fome to form of this celebrated ſyſtem ; there
                    are others who, with equal keenneſs, and founder reaſoning, maintain, that it
                    was happily calculated, not only to accompliſh the great deſign of</p>
                <p>preparing the w⅞y for the promulgation ⅛f the Gyfpel, but likewiſe to render tbe
                    Jews a more refined and virtuous people, and a better regulated community, than
                    a∏y neighbouring nation. ' In the ſirſt place, the attributes of the Deity were
                    very clearly exhibited to the Jews in the eſtabliſhment of their religion. The
                    miracles by which he delivered them from ſcrvſtude, and conducted them out of
                    Egypt, were ſtriking demonſtrations of his power ; that condeſcenſion with which
                    he forgave their repeated acta of perverſeneſs and rebel-lion, was a moſt
                    convincing proof of his benevolence ; and the impartiality with which the
                    obſervance and the violation of his laws were rewarded and puniſhed, even in the
                    preſent life, might well convince them of his juſtice. A part of the laws which
                    he dictated to Moſes are of eternal and univerfol obligation ; others of them
                    were local and particular, ſuited to the character ot the Jews, and their
                    circumſtances in the land of Canaan. The Jewiſh code, taken altogether, is not
                    to be conſidered as a complete ſyſtem of religion, or laws calculated for all
                    countries and all ages of fociety. When we conſider the expediency of this
                    ſyſtem, we muſt take care not to overlook the deſign for which the Jews are foid
                    to have been ſeparated from other nations, the circumſtances in which they had
                    lived in Egypt, the cu∙ ſtoms and manners which they had contracted by their
                    intercourfe with the natives of that country, the manner in which they were to
                    acquire to themfelves feulements by extirpating the nations of Canaan, the rank
                    which they were to hold among the nations of Syria and the adjacent countries,
                    together with the difficulty of reſtraining a people ſo little civilized and
                    enlightened from the idolatrous worſhip which prevailed among their neighbours :
                    All thcſe circumſtances were certainly to be taken into account j and had the
                    legiſlator of the Jews not attended to them, his inſtitutions muſt have remained
                    in force only for a ſhort period ; nor could they have produced auy laſtſhg
                    effects on the character of the nation, with a due attention to theſe
                    circumſtances, let us deſcend to an examination oſ particulars.</p>
                <p>Although in every religion or ſuperſtition that has prevailed through the world,
                    we ſind one part of its in-ſtitutions to conſiſt in the enjoining of certain
                    feſtivals to be celebrated by relaxation from labour, and the per· ſormance of
                    certain ceremonies in honour of the gods ; yet in none, or almoſt none beſides
                    the Jewiſh, do we ſind every ſeventh day ordained to be regularly kept holy. One
                    great end which the legiſlator of the Jews had in view in the inſtitution of the
                    Sabbath was, to impreſs them with a belief that God was the maker of the
                    univerſe. In the early ages of the world a great part of mankind imagined the
                    ſtars, the ſun, the moon, and the other planets, to be eternal, and consequently
                    objects highly worthy of adoration. To convince the Iſraelites of the abſurdity
                    of this belief, and prevent them from adopting that idolatry, Moſes taught them,
                    that thoſe confpicuδus objects which the Gentile nations regarded as eternal,
                    and endowed with divine power and intelligence, were created by the hand of Gβd
                    } who, after bringing all things out of nothing, and giving them form, order,
                    and harmony, in the ſpace of fix days, reſted on the ſeventh ſrom all his works.
                    Van-ous paſſages in the OΓd Teſtament concur to ſhow, that this was one great
                    end of the uiſtitution of the</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0071" facs="gri_33125011196389_0077.tif"/>
                <p>Sabbath. The obſervance of the Sabbath, and deteſta-tiυn of idolatrous worſhip,
                    are frequently inculcated together ; and, again, the breach of the Sabbath, and
                    the worſhip of idols, are uſually reprobated at the ſame time. Another good
                    reaſon for the inſtitution of a Sabbath might be, to remind the Jews of their
                    delive-rance from bondage, to inſpire them with humanity to ſtrangers and
                    domeſtics, and to mitigate the rigours of ſervitude.</p>
                <p>The purpoſes for which the other feſtivals of the Jewiſh religion were
                    inſtituted appear alſo of ſuſſicient importance. The great miracle, which, after
                    a ſeries of other miracles, all directed to the ſame end, finally effected the
                    deliverance of the Jews out of Egypt ; and their actualdeparture from that land
                    of ſervitude, might well be commemorated in the feaſt of the paffover. To recal
                    to the minds of poſterity the hiſtory of their anceſtors, to impreſs them with
                    an awful and grateful ſenſe of the goodnefs and greatnefs of God, and to make
                    them think of the purpoſes for which his almighty power had been ſo ſignally
                    exerted, were ſurely good reaions for the inſtitution of ſucſh a feſtival. The
                    feaſt of Pentecoſt celebrated the ſirſt declaration of the law by Moſes, in the
                    ſpace of fifty days after the feaſt of the paffover. It ferved alſo as a day of
                    folemn thankſgiving for the bleſſings of a plenteous harveſt. Οη the feaſt of
                    tabernacles, they remembered the wanderings of their anceſtors through the
                    wilderneſs, and expreffed their gratitude to heaven for the more comfortable
                    circumſtances in which they found themſelves placed. The feaſt of ncw moons
                    ſerved to fix their kalendar, and determine the times at which the other
                    feſtivals were to be celebrated ; on it trumpets were founded, to give public
                    notice of the event which was the cauſe of the feſtival ; no ſervile works were
                    performed, divine fervice was carefully attended, and the firſt fruits of the
                    month were offered to the Lord. The Jewiſh legiila-tor limited his feſtivals to
                    a very fmall number, while the heathens devoted a confiderable part of the year
                    to the celebration of theirs. But we perceive the occaſions upon which the
                    Jewiſh feſtivals were celebrated to have been of ſuitable importance ; whereas
                    thoſe of the heathens were often celebrated on trifling or ridiculous occafions.
                    Piety and innocent recreation ſſiared the Jewiſh feſtival ; the feſtivals'of the
                    heathens were chiefly devoted to debauchery and idleneſs.</p>
                <p>The Hebrews had other ſolemn ſeaſons of devotion beſides the weekly Sabbath and
                    the£e annual feſtivals. Every ſeventh year they reſted from labour: they were
                    then neither to plough, to low, nor to prune; and what-ever the earth produced
                    ſpontaneouſiy that year belonged rather to ſtrangers, orphans, and the poor,
                    than to the proprietors of the ground. Οη this year inſolvent debtors were
                    diſcharged from all debts contracted by purchaſing the neceffaries of life : and
                    the great end of this releaſe from debts contracted during the preceding fix
                    years, appears to have been to prevent the Hebrew from flying to the Gentiles
                    and forſaking his religion when embarraffed in his circumſtances. None but
                    native Iſraelites and proſelytes of righteouſneſs were admitted to this
                    privilege j it was refuſed to ſtrangers, and even to proſelytes of the gate. The
                    jubilee was a feſtival to be celebrated every fiftieth year. It produced the
                    fame effects with the ſabbatical year as to reſt from labour and the diſcharge
                    of debts j with this addition, that on the year of the jubilee ſlaves obtained
                    their freedom, and the lands reverted to the old pro-prietors. Οη the year of
                    the jubilee, as on the ſabba» tical year, the lands were to reſt uncultivated,
                    and law-ſuits were now to terminate. The chief deſign of this inſtitution
                    appears to have been, to preſerve the order of ranks and property originally
                    eſtabliſhed in the Hc-brew ſtate. None but iſraelites or circumciſed coq-verts
                    could enjoy the benefit pf this inſtitution ; nor could even theſe hope to
                    regain their eſtates on the year of the jubilee, if they fold them for any other
                    purpoſe but to ſupply their neceſſities. The law relative to ufury was evidently
                    founded on the ſame plan of polity with reſpect to property. To almoſt any other
                    nation fuch a law, it muſt be confeffed, would have been unſuitable and unjuft :
                    but as the Jews were not de-ſigned lor a trading nation, they could have little
                    occafion to borrow, unleſs to relieve diſtreſs; and as an indulgence to people
                    in fuch circumſtances, the Jew was foi bidden to exact uiury from his brother to
                    whom he had lent money.</p>
                <p>The Jewiſh legiflator, we may well think, would be diſpoſed to adopt every
                    proper method to prevent his nation from tailing away into the idolatry of
                    heathen nations. Probably one reaſon of the diſtinctions between <hi
                        rend="italic"> clean</hi> beaſts which they were permitted to eat, and <hi
                        rend="italic"> unclean</hi> beaſts, the eating of which they were tarn
                    &gt;ſht to conſider as pollution, was to prevent them from con-viyial
                    intercourfe with profane nations, by which they might be ſeduced to idolatry.
                    ∖Ve do not readily ſit down at table with people who are fond of diſhes which we
                    regard with abhorrence. And if the Jews were taught to loathe the ſleſh of ſome
                    of thofe animals which were among the greateſt delicacies of the Gentiles, they
                    would naturally of conſequence avoid fitting down aζ meat with them, either at
                    their ordinary meals or at thoſe entertainments which they prepared in honour of
                    their deities ; and this we may with good reaſon con-ſider as one happy mean to
                    preſerve them from idolatry· Beſides, the Jews were permitted, or rather
                    in-joined, to eat animals which the Gentiles reverenced as ſacred, and from
                    which they religiouſly witlι-lιeld alI violence. Goats, ſheep, and oxen, were
                    worſhipped in Egypt (ſee Polytheism and Pan) ; and ſeveral learned writers are
                    of opinion, that Moſes directed his people to ſacriſice and eat certain of the
                    favourite animals of the Egyptians, in order to remove from their minds any
                    opinions which they might have otherwiſe entertained oſ the ſanctity ot thole
                    pretended deities. Many of the obſervances which Moſes injoined with regard to
                    food, appear to have been intended to inſpire the Iſrael-ιtes with contempt for
                    the ſuperſtitions of the people among whom they had fo long lojourπed∙ Fhey were
                    to kill the animal which the Egyptians worſhipped; to roaſt the ſteſh which that
                    people ate raw j to eat the head, which they never ate ; and to drefs the
                    entrails, which they fet apart for divination. Theſe diſtinctions concurred with
                    the peculiarities of their drefs, language, government, cuſtoms, places, and
                    times of worſhip, and even the natural ſituation of their country, by which they
                    were in a manner confined and fortified on all ſides, to ſeparate them in luch a
                    manner from neighbouring nations, that they might eſcape the infection of their
                    idolatry. And if we reflect both on the deſign for which Providence ſeparated
                    the Iſraelites from other</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0072" facs="gri_33125011196389_0078.tif"/>
                <p>nations, and on the probability that, in the ſtate of fo-ciety in which mankind
                    were during the earlier period of the Jewiſh hiſtory, the Jews, by mixing with
                    other nations, would rather have been themſelves converted to idolatry than have
                    converted idolatrous nations to the worſhip of the true God ; we cannot but be
                    ſatisfied, that even this, however it may at firſt appear, was a benefit, not a
                    diſadvantage ; and in the author of their legiilation wiſdom, not caprice.</p>
                <p>But not only in the diſtinctions of meats, and between clean and unclean
                    animals, does the legiſlator of the Jews appear to have laboured to fix a
                    barrier be-tween them and other nations which might preſerve them from the
                    contagion of idolatry—we ſhall not err, perhaps, if we aſcnbe many particulars
                    of their worſhip to this defign in the inſtitutor. The heathens had gods who
                    preſided over woods, rivers, mountains, and valleys, and to each of theſe they
                    offered ſacrifices, and performed other rites oſ worſhip in a ſuitable place.
                    Sometimes the grove, ſometimes the mountain top, at ■other times the bank oſ the
                    river or the brink of the ſpring, was the ſceae of their devotions. But as the
                    •unity of the divine nature was the truth the moſt ear-neſtly inculcated on the
                    children- of Iſrael ; ſo in order to impreſs that truth on their minds with the
                    more powerful efficacy, they were taught to offer their facri-ſices and other
                    offerings only in one place, the place choſen by the Lord ; and death waβ
                    threatened to thoſe who dared to diſobey the command. To confirm this idea, one
                    of the prophets intimates, that when idolatry ſhould be aboliſhed, the worſhip
                    of God ſhould not be confined to Jeruſalem, but it would then be lawful to
                    worſhip him anywhere.</p>
                <p>The whole inſtitutions and obſervances of the Jewiſh religion appear to have
                    been deſigned and happily calculated to impreſs the minds of the people with
                    veneration and reſpect for the Deity. All the feſtivals which either
                    commemorated ſome gracious diſpenlation ef his providence towards their
                    anceſtors, or ſerved as days of thankſgiving for the conſtant returns of his
                    goodnefs to thoſe who celebrated them, and all the other rites defigned to
                    fortify them againſt idolatry, ſerved at the fame time to impreſs their hearts
                    with awful reverence for the God of Jacob, various other particulars in the
                    inſtitutions of the Jewiſh economy appear to have been directed ſolely to that
                    end. Into the moſt focred place, the Holy of Holies, none but the high prieſt
                    was admitted, and he only once a year. No five was ufed in ſacrifice but what
                    was taken from the altar. Severe puniſhments were on various occafions inflicted
                    on ſuch as preſumed to intermeddle in the ſervice of the foil ctuary in a manner
                    contrary to what the law had directed. All the laws reſpecting the character,
                    tlιe cireumſtances, and the ſervices, of the prieſts and the Levites, appear
                    plainly to have a fimilar ten-dency.</p>
                <p>In compliance with the notions of Deity which naturally prevailed among a groſs
                    and rude people, though •no vifible object of worſhip was granted to the Jews,
                    yet they were allowed in their wanderings through the wilderneſs to have a
                    tabernacle or portable temple, in which the ſovereign oſ the univerſe ſometimes
                    deigned to diſplay ſome rays of his glory. Incapable as they were of conceiving
                    aright concerning the ſpiritual nature and the omniprcſence of the Deity, they
                    might poſſibly have thought Jehovah careleſs and indifferent about them, had
                    they been at no time favoured with a vifible demonſtration of his preſence.</p>
                <p>The ſacrifices in uſe among the Gentiles in their ' worſhip of idols were
                    permitted by the Jewiſh legiſla-tor ; but he directed them to be offered with
                    views very different from thoſe with which the Gentiles ſacri-ficed to their
                    idols. Some of the ſacrifices of the Jewiſh ritual were deſigned to avert the
                    indignation oi the Deity ; ſome to expiate offences and purify the heart ; and
                    all of them to aboliſh or remove idolatry. Lultra-tions or ablutions entered
                    likewiſe into the Jewiſh ritual; but theſe were recommended and enjoined by
                    Moſes for purpofes widely different from thoſe which induced the heathens to
                    place ſo high a value upon them. The heathens practiſed them with magical and
                    fuperſtitious ceremonics ; but in the Jewiſh ritual they were intended limply
                    for the cleanfing away of impurities and pol-lutions.</p>
                <p>The theocratical form of government to which the Jews were ſubject, the rewards
                    which they were ſure of receiving, and the puniſhments which they were equally
                    liable to ſuffer in the preſent life, had a powerful effect to remove
                    ſuperftition and preſerve them from idolatry, as well as to ſupport all the
                    ſocial virtues among them. They were promiſed a numerous offspring, a land
                    flowing' with milk and honey, long life, and victory over their enemies, on the
                    condition of their paying a faithful obedience to the will of their heavenly
                    Sovereign ; plague, famine, diſeaſe, defeats, and death, were threatened as the
                    puniflιments to be inflicted on thoſe who violated his laws 5 and theſe
                    fonctions, it muſt be allowed, were happily accommodated to the genius of a rude
                    and carnal-minded people, attentive only to pre-ſent objects, and not likely to
                    be influenced by remote and ſpiritual conſiderations.</p>
                <p>There were other rites and prohibitions in the Mo-foic law, which appear to
                    have^had but little connection with religion, morals, or policy. Theſe may be
                    more liable to be objected againſt, as adding an unneceſſary weight to a buιden
                    which, though heavy, might yet have been otherwiſe borne in conſideration of the
                    advantages connected with it. Even theſe, however, may perhaps admit oſ being
                    viewed in a light in which they flιall appear to have been in no way
                    unfavourable to the happineſs of tho'ſe to whom they were enjoined. They appear
                    to have had none of them an immoral tendency; all of them had, in all
                    probability, a tendency to re-move or prevent idolatry, or to ſupport, in ſome
                    way or other, the religious and the civil eſtabliſhment to which they belonged.</p>
                <p>From theſe views of the ſpirit and tendency of the Jewiſh religion, we may
                    fairly conclude it to have been happily calculated to promote the welfare of
                    ſociety. In comparing it with other religions, it is neceffary to reflect on the
                    peculiar purpoſes tor which it was given ; that its two principal objects were
                    to preſerve the Jews a ſeparate people, and to guard them againſt the contagion
                    of the ſurrounding idolatry, when theſe things are taken into conlideration,
                    every candid mind acquainted with the hiſtory of ancient nations will readily
                    acknowledge that the whole ſyſtem, though calculated in-deed in a peculiar
                    manner for them, was as happily adapted for the purpoſes for which it had been
                    wifely and graciouſly intended, as it is poffible to imagine any</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0073" facs="gri_33125011196389_0079.tif"/>
                <p>Rich ſyſtem to be. It would be unhappy, indeed, if, on a compariſon of pure
                    theiſm with polytheiftn, the latter, with all its abſurdities, ſhould be found
                    more beneficial to mankind than the former. Tbe theiſm of the Jews was not
                    formed to be diffeminated through the earth ; that would have been inconſiſtent
                    with the purpofes for which it is ſaid to have been deſigned. But while the Jews
                    were ſeparated by their religion from all other nations, and perhaps, in ſome
                    degree, fixed and rendered ſtationary in their progreſs towards reſine-ment,
                    they were placed in circumſtances, in reſpect to laws, and government, and
                    religion, and moral light, which might with good reaſon render them the envy of
                    every other nation in the ancient world.</p>
                <p>IV. The Chriſtian religion next demands our attention. It is to be conſidered as
                    an improvement of the Jewiſh, or a new ſuperſtructure raiſed on the ſame baſis.
                    If the effects of the Jewiftt religion were beneficial to thoſe among whom it
                    was eſtabliſhed, they were confined almoſt to them alone. But is the ſpirit of
                    Chriſtianity equally pure and benignant ? Is its influence equally beneficial
                    and more diffuſtve than that of Judaiſm ? Does it really merit to have triumphed
                    over both the theiſm of the Jews and the polytheiſin of the heathens ?</p>
                <p>If we conſider the doctrines and precepts of the Chriſtian religion, nothing can
                    be more happily calculated to raife the dignity of human nature, and promote the
                    happineſs of mankind. The happineſs of the individual is beſt promoted by the
                    exerciſe of love and gratitude towards God, and relignation to his providence ;
                    of humanity, integrity, and good will towards men ; and by the due government βf
                    our appetites and paſſions. Social happineſs again proceeds from the members of
                    ſociety entertaining a diſintereſted regard for the public welfare ; being
                    actively indαftrious each in his proper ſphere of exertion ; and being ſtrictly
                    juſt and faithful, and generouſiy benevolent in their mutual intercourfe. The
                    tenor of the goſpel inculcates theſe virtues ; it feems everywhere through the
                    whole of the Chriſtian code to have been the great deſign of its Author to
                    in-ſpire mankind with mild, benevolent, and peaceable dif-poſitions, and to form
                    them to courteous manners. Chriſtianity again repreſents the Deity and his
                    ∙attri-butes in the faireſt light; even fo as to render our ideas of his nature,
                    and the manner in which he exerts his power, conſiſtent with the moſt correct
                    principles of morality that can be collected from all the other religions that
                    have prevailed in the earth, and from the writings of the moſt admired
                    philoſophers. The ritual obſervances which Chriſtianity enjoins are few in
                    number, eafy to perform, decent, expreſſive, and edifying. It inculcates no
                    duties but what are founded on thé principles of human nature, and on the
                    relation in which men ſtand to God, their Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier ;
                    and it preſcribes accurate rules for the regulation of the conduct. The
                    aſſiſtance of the ſpirit of God is promiſed in this ſacred volume to thoſe who
                    aſſiduouſly labour to difcharge the duties which it enjoins ; and it exhibits a
                    ſtriking example of ſpotleſs pu-rity, which we may fafely venture to imitate.
                    The goſpel teaches that worldly afflictions are incident to both good and bad
                    men ; a doctrine highly conducive to virtue, which conſoles us in diſtreſs,
                    prevents deſpair, ⅛n∙d encourages us to perſiſt ſirmlv in otιr integrity under
                    every difficulty and trial. Chriſtianſty reprefents all men as children of the
                    fame God, and heirs of the fame ſalvation, and levels all diſtinctions of rich
                    and poor, as accidental and inſigniſicant in the ſight of him who rewards or
                    puniſhes with impartiality according to the merits or demerits of his creatures.
                    This doctrine is highly favourable to virtue, as it tends to humble the proud,
                    and to communicate dignity of ſentiment to the lowly ; to render princes and
                    inferior magiſtrates mo-derate and juſt, gentle and condeſcending, to their
                    inferiors. It farther requires huſhands to be affectionate and indulgent to
                    their wives, wives to be faithful and reſpectful to their huſhands, and both to
                    be true and conſtant to each other. Such is the purity of the gofpel, that it
                    forbids us even to harbour impure thoughts; it requires us to abandon our vices,
                    however dear to us ; and to the cautious wiſdom of the ſerpent it directs us to
                    join the innocent ſimplicity of the dove. The Chriſtian diſpenſation, to prevent
                    a perſeverance in immorality, offers pardon for the pail, provided the offender
                    forfake his vicious practices, with a firm refolution to act differently in
                    future. The fonctions of the goſpel have a natural tendency to exalt the mind
                    above the paltry purſuits of this world, and to render the Chriſtian
                    incorruptible by wealth, honours, or plea-ſures. The true Chriſtian not only
                    abſtains from in-juſtice towards others, but even forgives thoſe injuries which
                    he himſelf ſuffers, knowing that he cannot otherwiſe hope for forgiveneſs from
                    God. Such are the precepts, ſuch the ſpirit, and ſuch the general tendency of
                    the goſpel. Even thoſe who refuſed to give credit to its doctrines and hiſtory
                    have yet acknowledged the excellence of its precepts. They have acknowledged,
                    that " no religion ever yet appeared in the world of which the natural tendency
                    was ſo much directed to promote the peace and happineſs of mankind as the
                    Chriſtian ; and that the goſpel of Chriſt is one continued leffon of the
                    ſtricteſt morality, of juſtice, benevolence, and univerfol charity.” Thefe are
                    thertvords of Bolingbroke, one of its keeneſt and moſt inſidious op-ponents.
                    without examining the effects of this religion on ſociety, we might almoſt
                    venture to pronounce with confidence, that a religion, the precepts of which are
                    ſo happily formed to promote all that is juſt and excellent, canηot but be in
                    the higheſt degree beneficial to mankind. By reviewing the effects which it has
                    actually produced, the favourable, opinion which we naturally conceive of it,
                    after conſtdering its precepts, cannot but be confirmed.</p>
                <p>Οηε circumftance we mtiſt take notice of as rather unfavourable to this review.
                    It is really impoffible to do juſtice to Chriſtianity by fuch a diſcuffion of
                    its merits. The virtues which it has a natural tendency to produce and cheriſh
                    in the human heart, are not of a noiſy oſtentatious kind ; they often eſcape the
                    Obſervation of the world. Temperance, gentleneſs, patience, benevolence,
                    juſtice, and general purity of manners, are not the qualities which moſt readily
                    attract the admiration and obtain the applaufe of men. The man of Roſs, whom Mr
                    Pope has ſo juſtly celebrated, was a private character ; his name is nt w likely
                    to live, and his virtues to be known to the lateſt poſterity : aud yet, however
                    diſintereſted his virtues, however beneficial his influence to all around him,
                    had his character not attracted the notice of that eminent poet, his name</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0074" facs="gri_33125011196389_0080.tif"/>
                <p>would perhaps ere this time have been loſt in oblivion. Individuals in private
                    life ſeldom engage the attention of the hiſtorian ; his object is to record the
                    actions of princes, warriors, and ſtateſmen. Had not the profeſ-ſors of
                    Chriſtianity in the. earlier ages of its exiſtence been expofed to perſecutlons,
                    and unjuſt âcculations ſrom which they were called on to vindicate themſelves,
                    we ſhonld be ſtrangers to the names and virtues of ſaints and martyrs, and to
                    the learning and endowments of the firſt apologiſts for Chriſtianity. We cap
                    therefore only trace the general influence of the mſti-tutions of Chriſtianity
                    on ſociety. We cannot hope to make an accurate enumeration of particulars. In
                    many of the countries in which it has been eſtabliſhed, it has produced a very
                    favourable change on the circumſtaiices of domeſtic life. Polygamy, a practice
                    repugnant to. the will of our Creator (fee Polygamy), who has declared his
                    intentions in this inſtance in the plaineſt manner, by cauſing nearly equal
                    numbers ol males and females to be brought into the world, was never com-pletely
                    abohſhed but by Chriſtianity.</p>
                <p>‘ The practice of divorce, too, though in ſome caſes proper and even neceffary,
                    had been lo much abuſed at the time of our Saviour’s appearance in the world,
                    that he found reaſon to declare it unlawful, unleſs in the eaſe of adultery. The
                    propriety and reaſonableneſs of this prohibition will ſufficiently appear, if we
                    conlideι, that when divorces <hi rend="sup">z</hi> are eaſily obtained, both
                    parties will often have nothing elfe in view at the period of marriage than the
                    diffolution of their nuptial engagements after a ſhort cohabitation ; the
                    intereſts of the huſhand and the wife will almoſt always be ſeparate ; and tbe
                    children of ſuch a marriage are ſcarce likely to enjoy the cordial affection and
                    tender watchful care of either parent. The huſhand in fuch a caſe will naturally
                    bc to his wife, not a friend and protector, but a tyrant ; fear and deceit, not
                    love, gratitude, or a ſenſe of duty, will be the principles of the wife’s
                    obedience.</p>
                <p>In another iwſtance, likewiſe, Chriſtianity has produced an happy changé on the
                    circumſtances of domeſtic life ; it muſt be acknowledged to havc contributed
                    greatly to the abolition of ſtavery, or at leaſt to the mi-tip ation of the
                    rigour of ſervitude. The cuſtoms and laws of the Romans in relation to ſlaves
                    were cruel and ſevere. Maſters were often ſo inhuman as to remove aged, ſick, or
                    infirm ſtaves, into an iſland in the Tiber, where they fuffered them to periſh
                    without pity or aſſiſtance. The greater part of the ſubjects of many of thoſe
                    republics which enjoyed the moſt liberty, groaned under tyrannical oppreffion ;
                    they were condemned to drag out a miſerable exiſtence in hard labour, under
                    inhuman uſage, and to be transferred like beaſts from one maſter to another. The
                    ſhardſhips of ſiavery were eaſed, not by any particular precept of the Gofpel,
                    but by the o∙entle and humane ſpirit which breathed through the general tenor of
                    the whole ſyſtctn of dortrines and precepts oſ which the Goſpel conſiſts. It
                    muſt indeed be allowed, that a trade in ſiaves is at preſent carried on by
                    people who prefume to call themſelves Chriſtians, and protected by the
                    legiſiature of Chriſtian ſtates: but the ſpirit of the Chriſtian code condemns
                    the practice, and the true Chriſtian will not engage in it.</p>
                <p>Partly by the direct and conſpicuous, partly by the ſecret and unſeen, influence
                    of Chriſtianity fince its promulgation in the world, the hearts of men have been</p>
                <p>gradually ſoftened; even barbarians have been formed to mildneſs and humanity ;
                    the influence of ſelfiſhneſs has been checked and reſtrained; and even war, amid
                    all the pernicious improvements by which men have fought to render it more
                    terrible, has affirmed much more of the ſpirit of mildnefε and peace than ever
                    entered into it during the reign of heatheniſm.</p>
                <p>If we review the hiſtory of mankind with a view to their political
                    circumſtances, we ſhall ſind, that by ſome means or other, it has happened,
                    ſince the time when the Goſpel was firſt preached, that both ſyſtems of
                    legiſlature and forms of government have been raiſed to much greater perfection,
                    at leaſt in thoſe parts of the world into which the religion of Jeſus has made
                    its way, and obtained an eſtabliſhment.</p>
                <p>The popular government of the Romans, notwithſtanding the multiplicity of their
                    laws, and the imperfections oſ their political conſtitution, was, no doubt,
                    happily enough adapted to promote the increafe of the power and the extenſion of
                    the empire of Rome. In Greece there were various republics, the wiſdom and
                    impartiality of whoſe laws have been highly celebrated. But we apprehend that
                    there is a ſufficient number of well authenticated facts to warrant us to
                    affirm, that ſince Chriſtianity has been propagated, and has had ſuf-ſicient
                    time to produce its full effect on arts, manners, and literature, even under
                    governments the form oi which might appear leſs favourable than tlm celebrated
                    models of antiquity to the liberty and happineſs ol the people in general, theſe
                    actually have been much better provided for than under the laws of Athens or
                    Sparta, or even of Rome in the days of the conſuls. It is a juft and happy
                    obiewatiυn of Monteiquieu, who has attributed ſo much to the influence of
                    climate and local circumſtances, that “ the mildneſs ſo frequently recommended
                    in the Goſpel is incompatible with the deſpotic rage with which an arbitrary
                    tyrant puniſhes lus ſubjects, and exerciſes himſelf in cruelty. Tt is the
                    Chriſtian religion (ſays he) which, in ſpite of the extent of empire, and the
                    influence of climate, has hindered deſpotiſm from being eſtabliſhed in Ethiopia,
                    and has carried into Africa the manners of Europe. The heir to the empire of
                    Ethiopia enjoys a principality, and gives to other ſubjects an example of love
                    and obedience— Not far from hence may be ſeen the Mahometan ſhut-ting up the
                    children of the king of Sennaar, at whoſe death the council fends to murder them
                    in favour of the prince who aſcends the throne. Let us ſet before our eyes
                    (continues that eloquent writer), in the third chapter of the 24th book of his
                    Spirit of Laws, on one hand the continual ιnaffacres of the kings and generals
                    of the Greeks and Romans, and on the other the deduction of people and cities by
                    the famous conquerors-Timur Beg and Jenghiz Kan, who ravaged Aſia, and we ſhall
                    perceive, that we owe to Chriſtianity in government a certain political law, and
                    in war a certain law of nations, which allows to the conquered the great-</p>
                <p>advantages of liberty, laws, wealth, and always religion, when the conqueror is
                    not blind to his own intereſt.”</p>
                <p>Theſe are the reflections of no common judge in this matter, but one who had
                    long ſtudied the hiſtory of nations, and obſerved the phenomena of the various
                    forms of ſociety, with ſuch fucceſs as few others have attained.</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0075" facs="gri_33125011196389_0081.tif"/>
                <p>But on no occafion has the mild influence of Chriſti-anity been more eminently
                    diſplayed, or more happily exerted, than in ſoftening· and humanizing the
                    barbarians who overturned the Roman empire. The idolatrous religion which
                    prevailed among thoſe tribes before their converfion to Chriſtianity, inſtead of
                    diſpoſing them to cultivate humanity and mildneſs of manners, contributed
                    ſtrongly to render them fierce and blood-thirſty, and eager to diſtinguiſh
                    themſelves by deeds of ſavage valour. But no ſooner had they fettled in the
                    dominions of Rome, and embraced the principles of Chriſtianity, than they became
                    a mild and generous people.</p>
                <p>we are informed by Moſheim, who was at pains to collect his materials from the
                    moſt authentic ſources, that in the loth century Chriſtian princes exerted
                    themſelves in the converfion of nations whoſe ſierceneſs they had experienced,
                    in order to ſoſten and render them more gentle. The mutual humanity with which
                    nations at war treat each other in modern times, is certainly owing, in a great
                    meaſure, to the influence of the mild precepts of the Goſpel. It is a fact
                    worthy of notice too, that during the barbarous ages, the ſpiritual courts of
                    juſtice were more rational and impartial in their deciſions than civil
                    tribunals.</p>
                <p>How many criminal practices which prevailed among heathen nations have been
                    aboliſhed by their converſion to Chriſtianity ! Chriſtians of all nations have
                    been obſerved to retain the virtues and reject the vicious practices of their
                    reſpective countries. In Parthia, where polygamy prevailed, they are not
                    polygamiſts ; in Perſia, the Chriſtian father does not marry his own daughter.
                    By the laws of Zoroaſter the Perſtans committed inceſt until they embraced the
                    Goſpel ; after which period they abſtained from that crime, and obſerved the
                    duties of chaſtity and temperance, as enjoined by its precepts. Even the
                    poliſhed and enlightened Romans were cruel and blood-thirſty before the
                    propagation of the Goſpel. The breaking of a glaſs, or iome inch trifling
                    offence, was ſuſſicient to provoke vidius Pυllio to caſt his ∩aves into
                    ſiſh-ponds to be devoured by lampreys. The effuſion of human blood was their
                    favourite entertainment ; they delighted to ſee men combating with beaſts, or
                    with one another ; and we are informed on reſpectable authority, that no wars
                    ever made ſucſh havock on mankind as the fights of gladiators, which ſometimes
                    deprived Europe of 20,000 lives in one month. Not the humanity oſ Titus, nor the
                    wiſdom and virtue of Trajan, could abohſh the barbarous fpectacle. However
                    humane and wiſe in other inftances, in this practice thoſe princes complied with
                    the cuſtom oſ their country, and exhibited ſplendid ſhows of gladiators, in
                    which the combatants were matched by pairs ; who, though they had never injured
                    nor offended each Other, yet were obliged to maim and murder one another in cold
                    blood. Chriſtian divines ſoon exerciſed their pens againſt theſe horrid
                    practices; the Chriſtian emperor Conſtantine reſtrained them by edicts, and
                    Ho-norius finally aboliſhed them. It would be tedious to proceed through an
                    enumeration of particulars ; but wherever Chriſtianity has been propagated, it
                    has conſtantly operated to the civilization oſ the manners of mankind, and to
                    the abolition of abſurd and criminal practices. The Iriſh, the Scotch, and all
                    the ancient inhabitants of the Britiſh iſles, were, notwithſtanding</p>
                <p>their intercourfe with the Romans, rude barbarians, till ſuch time as they were
                    converted to Chriſtianity. The inhuman practice of expofing infants, which once
                    pre-vailed ſo generally over the world, and ſtill prevails a-mong ſome Pagan
                    nations, even under very humane and enlightened legiſlatures, yielded to the
                    influence of Chriſtianity.</p>
                <p>Let us likewiſe remember, in honour of Chriſtianity, that it has contributed
                    eminently to the diffuiion of knowledge, the preſervation and the advancement of
                    learning. AVhen the barbarians overſpread Europe, what muſt have become of the
                    precious remains of poliſhed, enlightened antiquity, had there been no other
                    depoſttaries to preſerve them but the heathen prieſts ? we allow that even the
                    Romiſh clergy during the dark ages did not ſtudy the celebrated models of
                    ancient times with much advantage themſelves, and did not labour with much
                    aſſiduity to make the laity acquainted with them. It muſt even be acknowledged,
                    that they did not always preſerve thoſe monuments of genius with ſuſſicient
                    care, as they were often ignorant of their real value. Yet, after all, it will
                    be granted, it cannot be denied, that had it not been ſor the clergy of the
                    Chriſtian church, the lamp of learning would, in all probability, have been
                    entirely extinguiſhed, during that night of ignorance and barbarity in which all
                    Europe were buried for a long ſeries of centuries, after the irruption of the
                    barbarians into the Roman em</p>
                <p>pire.</p>
                <p>Such is the excellence of the Chriſtian ſyſtem, and ſuch its tendency to
                    meliorate the human character, that its beneficial influence lias not been
                    confined to thoſe who have received its doctrines and precepts, and have
                    profeffed themſelves Chriſtians; it has even produced many happy effects on the
                    circumſtances and the characters oſ Pagans and infidels, who have had
                    opportunities of beholding the virtues of Chriſtians, and learning the
                    excellence of the morality of the goſpel. Thoſe virtues which diſtinguifiied the
                    character of the apoſtate Julian were ſurely owing in no inconfiderable degree
                    to his acquaintance with Chriſtianity ; and it is an undeniable fact, that after
                    the propagation of Chriſtianity through the Roman empire, even while the purity
                    of that holy religion was gradually debaſed, the manners of thoſe Pagans who
                    remained unconverted became more pure, and their religious doctrines and worſhip
                    leſs immoral and abſurd.— We might here adduce a tedious ſeries of facts to the
                    ſame purpoſe. whenever Chriſtians have had any intercourfe with Pagan idolaters,
                    and have not concealed the laws of the goſpel, nor ſhown by their conduct that
                    they diſ-regarded them, even thoſe who have not been converted to Chriſtianity
                    have, however, been improved in their diſpoſitions and manners by its influence.
                    The emperor, whoſe virtues we have mentioned as arifing, in a certain degree,
                    from his acquaintance with Chriſtianity, in a letter to an Heathen pontiff,
                    deſires him to turn his eyes to the means by which the ſuperſtition of
                    Chriſtians was propagated: bykindneſs to ſtrangers, by ſanctity of life, and by
                    the attention which they paid to the burial of the dead. He recommends an
                    imitation of their virtues, exhorts him to canſe the prieſts of Galatia to be
                    attentive to the worſhip of their gods, and authoriſes him to ſtrip them of the
                    ſacerdotal function, unleſs they obliged their wives, children, and ſervants,</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0076" facs="gri_33125011196389_0082.tif"/>
                <p>to pay attention to the ſame duties. He likewiſe en-jυins works of beneficence,
                    deſires the prieſt to relieve the diſtreſſed, and to build houſes for the
                    accommodation of ſtrangers of whatever religion ; and ſays, it is a diſgrace for
                    Pagans to difregard thoſe of their own religion, while Chriſtians do kind
                    offices to ſtrangers and enemies. This is indeed an eminent inſtance of the
                    happy influence of Chriſtianity even on the ſentiments and manners of thoſe who
                    regarded the Chriſtian name with abhorrence.</p>
                <p>Upon the whole then, may we not, from the parti-ciſlars here exhibited
                    concerning the influence of this religion on the manners and happineſs of men in
                    ſociety, conclude that Chriſtianity is infinitely ſuperior to the ſuperſtitions
                    of Paganiſm ? as being in its tendency unifoιraly favourable to the virtue and
                    the happinefs of mankind, and even to the ſyſtem of religion and laws delivered
                    by Moſes to the children of Iſrael : becauſe, while the religion of the Jews was
                    calculated only for one particular nation, and it may almoſt be ſaid for one
                    particular ſtage in the progreſs of ſociety, Chriſtiani-ty is an univerſal
                    religion, formed to exert its happy influence in all ages and among all nations
                    ; and has a tendency to diſpel the ſhades of barliariſm and ignorance, to
                    promote the cultivation of the powers of the human underſtanding, and to
                    encourage every virtuous refinement of manners.</p>
                <p>V. Another religion, which has made and ſtill makes a conſpicuous figure in the
                    world remains yet to be examined. The religion of Mahomet is that which we here
                    allude to. whether we conſider through what an extenſive part of the globe that
                    religion prevails, the political importance of the nations among whom it is
                    profeſſed, or the ſtriking peculiarity of cha-racter by which it is
                    diſtinguiſhed from all other religious ſyſtems—it is for all theſe reafons well
                    worthy of particular notice. Like the Jewiſh religion, it is not barely a ſyſtem
                    oſ religious doctrines and general moral precepts ; it forms both the civil
                    legiſlature and. the religious ſyſtem of thofe nations among whom it is
                    profeſſed ; and, like it too, it would appear to be calcula-t⅛d rather for one
                    particular period in the progreſs of mankind from rudenefs to refinement, than
                    for all ages and all ſtates of fociety.</p>
                <p>The hiſtory of its origin is pretty well known, and we have had occaſion to
                    enlarge upon it under a former article (fée Mahomet and&lt; Mahometanism).
                    ∖Ve are not here to trace the impoſtures of the prophet, or to conſider the arts
                    by which, he io ſuccefsfully accompliſhed his deſigns ; but merely to eonſider
                    the morality of his religion, and its influence on civil order and the happineſs
                    of fociety.</p>
                <p>If we view the ſtate of the- nations among whom it is eſtabliſhed, we cannot
                    hefitate a moment to declare if friendly to . ignorance, to deſpotiſm, and to
                    impurity of manners- The Turks, the Perfians, and the Malays, are all Mahometans
                    ; and in reviewing their hiſtory aud confidering their preſent ſtate, we might
                    find a ſufficient nnmhër of facts to juſtify the above aflertion and we muſt not
                    neglect to obſerve, that, as thoſe nations are not known to have ever been ſince
                    their con-verfion to Mâhometanifm under a much happier government, or in a much
                    more civilized ſtate than at preſent, it cannot be, with any degree of fairnefs,
                    argued, with refpect to Mahometaniſen as with reſpect to Chriitiani-.</p>
                <p>ty, that it is only when its influence is ſo oppoſed by other cauſes as to
                    prevent it from producing its full effects, that it does not conduct thoſe
                    ſocieties among which it is eftabliſhed to an high ſtate of civilization and
                    refinement.</p>
                <p>Οηε, and that by no means an inconfiderable, part of the Koran, was occafionally
                    invented to ſolve ſome difficulty with which the prophet found himſelf at the
                    time perplexed, or to help him to the gratification of his ruling paſſions, luſt
                    and ambition, when he and his followers were, at any time, unſucceſsful in thoſe
                    wars by which he fought to propagate his religion, to prevent them from falling
                    away into unbelief, or finking into deſpondency, he took care to inform them
                    that God ſuſſered ſuch misfortunes to befal believers, as a pυniflιment for
                    their fins, and to try their faith. The doctrine of predeſtination, which he
                    affiduouſly inculcated, had an happy effect to perfuade his followers to ruſh
                    boldly into the midſt of death and danger at his command. He prevailed with Zeyd
                    to put away his -wife, married her himſelf, and pretended that his crime had the
                    approbation of heaven ; and, in the Koran, he introduces the Deity approving of
                    this marriage. Being repulſed from the fiege of Mecca, he made a league with the
                    inhabitants ; but on the very next year, finding it convenient to ſurprife the
                    city, by violating this treaty, he juſtified his perfidy by teaching his
                    followers to difregard promiſes or leagues made with infidels. In ſome inſtances
                    again, we find abſurd prohibitions en-joined for fimilar reafons : his officers,
                    having on ſome occafion drunk to exceſs, excited much riot and confufion in the
                    camp, he prohibited the uſe of wine and other inebriating liquors among his
                    followers in future* Now, though it muſt be acknowledged that many evils ariſe
                    from the uſe of theſe liquors, yet we cannot but think that, when uſed in
                    moderation, they are in many cafés beneficial to men ; and certainly as much
                    allowed by God as. opium, which the Mahometans have ſubſti-tuted in their place.</p>
                <p>Mahomet· is allowed to have copied from the Chrb ſtian and the Jewiſh religions,
                    as well as from the ido-latrous fiiperſtitions which prevailed through Arabia,
                    and thus to have formed a motley mixture of reafon and abſurdity, of pure theiſm
                    and wild ſuperſtition. He coniidered alfo the circumftances of his country, and
                    the prejudices of his countrymen, when he attended to the former, he was
                    generally judicious enough to fuit his doctrines and decifions to them with
                    ſufficient ſkill ; the latter he alſo managed with the greateſt'art : but he
                    entered into accommodation with them in in-ſtauces when a true prophet or a wiſe
                    ;and upright le-gi∏ator would ſurely have oppofed them with decifive vigour. .
                    where the prophet indulges his own fancy, <hi rend="sub">7</hi> or borrows
                    from the ſuperſtitions of hie countrymen, nothing can be more ridiculous than
                    that.rhapſody of lies, contradictions, and extravagant fables, which he delivers
                    to his followers.' Amazing are the abſurdities which he relates concerning the
                    patriarchs, concerning . Solomon, and concerning- the&gt; animals that were
                    affuιr bled in Noah’s ark.</p>
                <p>But in the whole tiſſue cf abfurdities of which his ſyſtem confiſts, there is
                    nothing mere abſurd, or more happily calculated to promote impurity of manners,
                    than his deſcriptions of heaven and hell ; the ideas of future rewards and
                    puniſhments which he fought to imprefe</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0077" facs="gri_33125011196389_0083.tif"/>
                <p>on the minds of his followers. Paradiſe was to abound with rivers, trees,
                    fruits, and ſhady groves ; wine which would not intoxicate was to be there
                    plentifully ſerved up to believers ; the inhabitants of that happy region were
                    all to enjoy perpetual youth ; and their powers of enjoyment were to be enlarged
                    and invigorated, in order that ſo many fine things might not be thrown away upon
                    them. " Inſtead of inſpiring the bleffed inhabitants of paradiſe with a liberal
                    taſte for harmony and fcience, converſation,and friendſhip (ſays Mr Gibbon),
                    Mahomet idly celebrates tbe pearls and diamonds, the robes of ſilk, palaces of
                    marble, diſhes of gold, rich wines, artificial dainties, numerous attendants,
                    and the whole train of ſenſual luxury.—Seventy two houris, or black-eyed girls
                    of refplendent beauty, blooming youth, virgin purity, and exquifite ſenfibility,
                    will be created for the uſe of the meaneſt believer ; a moment of pleaſure will
                    be prolonged for ι ooo years, and his faculties will be increaſed ioo fold, to
                    render him worthy of his felicity.” It muſt be acknowledged that he allows
                    believers other more refined enjoyments than theſe ; thus they are to ſee the
                    face of God morn-ing and evening ; a pleaſure which is far to exceed all the
                    other pleaſures of paradiſe. The following is his deſcription of the puniſhments
                    of hell : The wicked are there to drink nothing but boiling ſtinking water ;
                    breathe nothing but hot winds ; dwell for ever in continual burning fire and
                    fmoke ; eat nothing but briars and thorns, and the fruit of a tree that rifeth
                    out of the bottom of hell, whoſe branches reſemble the heads of devils, and
                    whole fruits fiιall be in their bellies like burning pitch.</p>
                <p>All that we can conclude from a general view of the religion of Mahomet, from
                    confidering the character oſ the prophet, er from reviewing the hiſtory of the
                    nations among whom it has been eſtabliſhed, is, that it is one tiffue of
                    abſurdities, with a few truths, however, and valuable precepts incongruouſly
                    intermixed ; that a great part of it is unfavourable to virtuous manners, to
                    wiſe and equal laws, and to the progreſs of knowledge and refinement. It often
                    inculcates in a direct manner ſentiments that are highly immoral ; it
                    fubſtitutes trifling, ſuperſtitious obfervaπces in the room of genuine piety and
                    moral virtue; and it gives ſuch views of futurity as render purity of heart no
                    neceffary qualification for feeing God.</p>
                <p>Surely, therefore, even the deiſt, who rejects all but natural religion, would
                    not hefitate to prefer Chriſtianity, and even Judaiſm, to the religion of
                    Mahomet. Judaiſm, calculated for a peculiar people, was undoubtedly much more
                    fublime and much more happily framed to render that people virtuous and·happy in
                    the·circumſtances in which they were placed; and Chriſtianity we find to be an
                    univerſal religion, ſuited to all circumſtances and to all the ſtages of
                    ſociety, and acting, wherever it is received, with more or lets'force to the
                    ſupport of civil order, virtuous manners, improvement of arts, and the
                    advancement· of fctcnce. However, as Mahometaniſm forms in feme meaſure a
                    regular ſyſtem, as it has borrowed many of the precepts and doctrines of Judaiſm
                    and Chriſtianity, not indeed without corrupting and degrading them; and- as it
                    has contributed conſiderably to the ſupport of civil government, although ⅛ a
                    very imperfect form, in thoſe countries in which ſt has obtained an
                    eſtabliſhment ; for all theſe</p>
                <p>reafons we canaot but give it the preference to the ſu-perſtitions of Paganiſm.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The whole reſult of our inquiries under this article,
                        therefore, is, I. That as man, by the conſtitution of his mind, is naturally
                        fitted for acquiring certain no-tions concerning the exiſtence of invifible,
                        ſuperior be-ings, and their influence on human life ; ſo the reli-gious
                        ideas which we find to have in all ages of the world, and in all the
                        different ſtages of the progteſs of ſociety, prevailed among mankind, appear
                        to have originated partly from the natural exertions of the human
                        imagination, underſtanding, and paſſions, in various cir- ~ cumſtances, and
                        partly from ſupernatural revelation.</hi></p>
                <p>2. That though religious opinions, together with the moral precepts, and the
                    rites of worſhip connected with them, may appear to have been in numerous
                    inſtances injurious to the virtue and happinefs of ſociety ; yet <hi rend="sub">r</hi> as they have often contributed to lead the mind to form moral
                    diſtinctions, when it would otherwiſe in all probability have been an entire
                    ſtranger to ſuch diſtinctions ; and as they lrave always contributed in an
                    effential manner to the eſtabliſhment and the ſupport of civil government—it
                    muſt therefore be acknowledged that they have always, even in their humbleſt
                    ſtate, ∙ been more beneficial than hurtful to mankind.</p>
                <p>3. That when the different ſyſtems of religion that have prevailed in the world
                    are comparatively viewed with reſpect to their influence on the welfare of
                    ſociety, we find reaſon to prefer the polytheiſin of the Greeks and Romans to
                    the ruder, wilder, religious ideas and ceremonies that have prevailed among
                    ſavages ; Mahometaniſm, perhaps in ſorne reſpects, to the pol⅛theifm of the
                    Greeks and Romans ; Judaiſin however to Mahometaniſm ; and Chriſtianity to all
                    of them.</p>
