<p><span class="font0">own person and by inheritance the natural spell which sways the imagination of the world. The sentiment of&nbsp;hero-worship was at all times strong in the Romans, and&nbsp;no one was ever the object of more sincere as well as&nbsp;simulated hero-worship than Augustus. It was not, however, by his equals in station that the first feeling was&nbsp;likely to be entertained. The earliest to give expression&nbsp;to it was the humbly-born poet from the Cisalpine province ; but the spell was soon acknowledged by the calmer&nbsp;and more worldly-wise poet whose first enthusiasm had&nbsp;directed him into the opposite camp. The disgust aroused&nbsp;by the anti-national policy of Antony, and the danger to&nbsp;the empire which was averted by the result of the battle&nbsp;of Actium, with the confidence inspired by the new ruler,&nbsp;combined to reconcile the great families as well as the&nbsp;great body of the people to the new order of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While the establishment of the empire produced a revival of national and imperial feeling, it suppressed all independent political thought and action. Hence the two great&nbsp;forms of prose literature which drew their nourishment&nbsp;from the struggles of political life, oratory and contemporary history, were arrested in their development. The&nbsp;chief interest of letter-writing had consisted in its being&nbsp;the medium of interchange of thought on politics, and&nbsp;thus, although correspondence between friends still went&nbsp;on as before, no collection of letters was of sufficient importance to be preserved. The main course of literature&nbsp;was thus for a time diverted into poetry. That poetry&nbsp;in its most elevated form aimed at being the organ of the&nbsp;new empire and of realizing the national ideals of life and&nbsp;character under its auspices; and in carrying out this aim&nbsp;it sought to recall the great memories of the past. It&nbsp;became also the organ of the pleasures and interests of&nbsp;private life, the chief motives of which were the love of&nbsp;nature and the passion of love. It sought also to make&nbsp;the art and poetry of Greece live a new artistic life. Satire,&nbsp;debarred from that comment on political action which had&nbsp;been open to Lucilius and to Catullus and Calvus under&nbsp;the republic, turned to social and individual life, and combined with the newly-developed taste for ethical analysis&nbsp;and reflexion introduced by Cicero. One great work had&nbsp;still to be done in prose—a retrospect of the past history&nbsp;of the state from an idealizing and romanticizing point of&nbsp;view. For that work the Augustan age, as the end of one&nbsp;great cycle of events and the beginning of another, was&nbsp;eminently suited, and a writer who, by his gifts of imagination and sympathy, was perhaps better fitted than any&nbsp;other man of antiquity for the task, and who through the&nbsp;whole of this period lived a life of literary leisure, was&nbsp;found to do justice to the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although the age did not afford that free scope and stimulus to individual energy and enterprise which have&nbsp;been the conditions under which the most truly creative&nbsp;literature has flourished, no age afforded more material&nbsp;and social advantages for the peaceful cultivation of letters.&nbsp;The new influence of patronage, which in other times has&nbsp;chilled the genial current of literature, became, in the&nbsp;person of Maecenas, the medium through which literature&nbsp;and the imperial policy were brought into union. Poetry&nbsp;thus acquired the tone of the world, kept in close connexion&nbsp;with the chief source of national life, while it was cultivated to the highest pitch of artistic perfection under the&nbsp;most favourable conditions of leisure and freedom from&nbsp;the distractions and anxieties of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The earliest in the order of time of the poets who adorn this age—Virgil (70-19)—is also the greatest in genius,&nbsp;the most richly cultivated, and the most perfect in art.&nbsp;He is the idealizing poet of the hopes and aspirations and&nbsp;of the purer and happier life of which the age seemed to&nbsp;contain the promise. He elevates the present by associating it with the past and future of the world, and sanctifies it by seeing in it the fulfilment of a divine purpose.&nbsp;Poetry is no longer, as in the previous generation, in discord with the dominant tendency of affairs, but in harmony&nbsp;with all that was restorative of the peace, order, and&nbsp;happiness of the world. Virgil is the true representative&nbsp;poet of Rome and Italy, of national glory and of the&nbsp;beauty of nature, the artist in whom all the efforts of the&nbsp;past were made perfect, and the unapproachable standard&nbsp;of excellence to future times. While more richly endowed&nbsp;with sensibility to all native influences, he was more deeply&nbsp;imbued than any of his contemporaries with the poetry,&nbsp;the thought, and the learning of Greece. It was by leaning on these supports that his genius felt its way and&nbsp;expanded into higher and wider development. His art&nbsp;begins in imitation of the cadences, the diction, and the&nbsp;pastoral fancies of Theocritus ; but even in these imitative&nbsp;poems of his youth we see that he is perfect master of&nbsp;his materials. The Latin hexameter, which in Ennius and&nbsp;Lucretius was the organ of the more dignified and majestic&nbsp;emotions, became in his hands the most perfect measure&nbsp;in which the softer and more luxurious sentiment of nature&nbsp;has been expressed; and the Latin language was enriched&nbsp;with its sweetest and most musical variations. The sentiment of Italian scenery and the love which the Italian&nbsp;peasant has for the familiar sights and sounds of his home&nbsp;found a voice which never can pass away; and the joy&nbsp;and pain of the passion of love were revealed in these poems&nbsp;in a way as yet unapprehended by the world. In this&nbsp;the earliest and least serious effort of Virgil’s genius there&nbsp;is no immaturity of art, and in poems outwardly most&nbsp;remote from the current of active life there is the recognition of the master-force by which that current was destined&nbsp;to be impelled and controlled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In his next poem, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Georgies,</span><span class="font0"> we are struck by the great advance in the originality and self-dependence of the&nbsp;artist, in the mature perfection of his workmanship, in the&nbsp;deepening and strengthening of all his sympathies and&nbsp;convictions. His genius still works under forms prescribed&nbsp;by Greek art, and under the disadvantage of having a&nbsp;practical and utilitarian aim imposed on it. But he has&nbsp;even in form so far surpassed his originals that he alone&nbsp;has gained for the pure didactic poem a place among the&nbsp;highest forms of serious poetry, while he has so transmuted&nbsp;his material that, without violation of truth, he has made&nbsp;the whole poem alive with poetic feeling. The homeliest&nbsp;details of the farmer’s work are transfigured through the&nbsp;magical potency of the poet’s love of nature in her immediate charm of sight and sound and in her all-pervading&nbsp;presence, especially as that charm and presence reveal&nbsp;themselves in the land and climate of Italy; through his&nbsp;religious feeling and his pious sympathy with the sanctities of human affection ; through his patriotic sympathy&nbsp;with the national greatness; and through the rich allusiveness of his art to everything in poetry and legend&nbsp;which can illustrate and glorify his theme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pastoral Poems</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Georgies</span><span class="font0"> Virgil is the idealizing poet of the beauty and of the old simple and hardy life of Italy, as the imagination could conceive of it in an&nbsp;altered world. In the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sEneid,</span><span class="font0"> he is the idealizing poet of&nbsp;national glory, especially as that glory was manifested in&nbsp;the person of Augustus. The epic of national life, vividly&nbsp;conceived but rudely executed by Ennius, was perfected&nbsp;in the years that followed the decisive victory at Actium.&nbsp;To do justice to his idea Virgil enters into rivalry with a&nbsp;greater poet than those whom he had equalled or surpassed in his previous works. And, though he cannot&nbsp;unroll before us the page of heroic action with the power&nbsp;and majesty of Homer, yet by the sympathy with which&nbsp;he realizes the idea of Rome, and by the power with which</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
