σχηπτιχος from σχεπτομαν, "I conſider, look about, or deliberate, ” properly ſignifies <hi rend="italic">conſiderative</hi> and <hi rend="italic">inquiſitive,</hi> or one who is always weighing reaſons on one fide, and the other without ever deciding between them. It is chiefly applied to an ancient ſect of philoſophers founded by Pyrrho (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Pyrrho),</hi> who, according to Laertius, had various other denominations. From their maſter they were called <hi rend="italic">Pyrrhonians</hi>; from the diſtinguiſhing tenets or characteriſtic of their philoſophy they derived the name of <hi rend="italic">Aporetici,</hi> from απορειν, “to doubt;” from their ſuſpenſion and heſitation they were called <hi rend="italic">ephectici,</hi> from “to ſtay or keep back;”</p><p>and laſtly, they were called <hi rend="italic">zetetici</hi> or <hi rend="italic">seekers,</hi> from their never getting beyond the ſearch of truth.</p><p>That the ſceptical philoſophy is abſurd, can admit of no diſpute in the preſent age; and that many of the followers of Pyrrho carried it to the moſt ridiculous height, is no leſs true. But we cannot believe that he himſelf was ſo extravagantly ſceptical as has ſometimes been afferted, when we reflect on the particula∣s of his life, which are ſtill preſerved, and the reſpectful manner in which we find him mentioned by his contemporaries and writers of the firſt name who flouriſhed ſoon after him. The truth, as far as at this diſtance of time it can be diſcovered, ſeems to be, that he learned from Democritus to deny the real exiſtence of all qualities in bodies, except thoſe which are eſſential to primary atoms, and that he referred every thing elſe to the perceptions of the mind produced by external objects, in other words, to appearance and opinion. All knowledge of courſe appeared to him to depend on the fallacious report of the ſenſes, and conſtquently to be uncertain; and in this notion he was confirmed by the general ſpirit of the Eleatic ſchool in which he was educated. He was further confirmed in his ſcepticiſm by the ſubtilties of the Dialectic ſchools, in which he had been inſtructed by the lon of Stilpo; chooſing to overturn the cavils of ſophiſtry by recurring to the doctrine of univerſal uncertainty, and thus breaking the knot which he could not unlooſe. For being naturally and habitually inclined to conſider immoveable tranquillity as the great end of all philoſophy, he was eaſily led to deſpiſe the diſſenſions of the dogmatiſts, and to infer from their endleſs diſputes, the uncertainty of the queſtions on which they debated; controverſy, as it has often happened to others, becoming alſo with reſpect to him the parent of ſcepticiſm.</p><p>Pyrrho’s doctrines, however new and extraordinary, were not totally diſregarded. He was attended by ſeveral ſcholars, and ſucceeded by ſeveral followers, who preſerved the memory of his notions. The moſt eminent of his followers was Timon (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Timon),</hi> in whom the public ſucceſſion of profeſſors in the Pyrrhonic ſchool terminated. In the time of Cicero it was almoſt extinct, having ſuffered much from the jealouſy of the dogmatiſts, and from a natural averſion in the human mind to acknowledge total ignorance, or to be left in abſolute darkneſs. The diſciples of Timon, however, ſtill continued to profeſs ſcepticiſm, and their notions were embraced privately at leaſt by many others. The ſchool itſelf was afterwards revived by Ptolaemeus a Cyrenian, and was continued byÆnefidemus a contemporaryot Cicero, who wrote a treatiſe on the principles of the Pyrrhonic philoſophy, the heads of which are preſerved by<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0703.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0697"/>
Photius. From this time it was continued through a ſeries of preceptors of little note to Sextus Empiricus, who alſo gave a ſummary of the ſceptical doctrine.</p><p>A ſyſtem of philoſophy thus founded on doubt, and clouded with uncertainty, could neither teach tenets of any importance, nor preſcribe a certain rule of conduct; and accordingly we find that the followers of ſcepticiſm were guided entirely by chance. As they could form no certain judgment reſpecting good and evil, they accidentally learned the folly of eagerly purſuing any apparent good, or of avoiding any apparent evil; and their minds of courſe fettled into a ſtate of undiſturbed tranquillity, the grand poſtulatum of their ſyſtem.</p><p>In the ſchools of the ſceptics we find ten diſtinct topics of argument urged in ſupport of the doctrine of uncertainty, with this precaution, however, that nothing could be poſitively aſſerted either concerning their number or their force. Theſe arguments chiefly reſpect objects of ſenſe: they place all knowledge in appearance; and, as the ſame things appear very different to different people, it is impoſſible to ſay which appearance moſt truly expreffes their real nature. They likewiſe ſay, that our judgment is liable to uncertainty from the circumſtance of frequent or rare occurrence, and that mankind are continually led into different conceptions concerning the ſame thing by means of cuſtom, law, fabulous tales, and eſtabliſhed opinions. On all theſe accounts they think every human judgment is liable to uncertainty; and concerning any thing they can only aſſert, that it ſeems to be, not that it is what it ſeems.</p><p>This doubtful reaſoning, if reaſoning it may be called, the ſceptics extended to all the ſciences in which they diſcovered nothing true, or which could be abſolutely aſſerted. In all nature, in phyſics, morals, and theology, they found contradictory opinions, and inexplicable or incomprehenſible phenomena. In phyſics, the appearances they thought might be deceitful; and reſpecting the nature of God and the duties of morality, men were, in their opinion, equally ignorant and uncertain. To overturn the ſophiſtical arguments of theſe ſceptical reaſoners would be no difficult matter, if their reaſoning were worthy of confutation. Indeed, their great principle is ſufficiently, though ſhortly, refuted by Plato, in theſe words. “When you ſay all things are incomprehenſible (ſays he), do you comprehend or conceive that they are thus incomprehenſible, or do you not? If you do, then ſomething is comprehenſible; if you do not, there is no reaſon we ſhould believe you, ſince you do not comprehend your own aſſertion. ”</p><p>But ſcepticiſm has not been confined entirely to the ancients and to the followers of Pyrrho. Numerous ſceptics have ariſen alſo in modern times, varying in their principles, manners, and character, as chance, prejudice, vanity, weakneſs, or indolence, prompted them. The great object, however, which they ſeem to have in view, is to overturn, or at leaſt to weaken, the evidence of analogy, experience, and teſtimony; though ſome of them have even attempted to ſhow, that the axioms of geometry are uncertain, and its demonſtrations inconcluſive. This laſt attempt has not indeed been often made; but the chief aim of Mr Hume’s philoſophical writings is to introduce doubts into every branch of <hi rend="italic">phyſics, metaphyſics, history, ethics,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">theology.</hi> It is needleſs to give a ſpecimen of his reaſonings in ſupport of modern ſcepticiſm. The moſt important of them have</p><p>been noticed elſewhere (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Miracle, Metaphysics,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Philosophy,</hi> n <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> 41. ); and ſuch of our readers as have any reliſh for ſpeculations of that nature can be no ſtrangers to his Eſſays, or to the able confutations of them by the Doctors Reid, Campbell, Gregory, and Beattie, who have likewiſe expoſed the weakneſs of the ſceptical reaſonings of Des Cartes, Malbranche, and other philoſophers of great fame in the ſame ſchool.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
