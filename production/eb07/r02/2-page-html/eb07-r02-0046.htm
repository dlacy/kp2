<p><span class="font0">of the charge of repairing roads was taken off the respective parishes through which they pass, and levied on the general traveller by means of turnpike-gates ; but it was for many&nbsp;years a complaint that the roads were little, if at all, fundamentally improved by the expenditure of the money so raised. This complaint is very energetically advanced in a&nbsp;Dissertation concerning the present State of the High Roads&nbsp;of England, especially of those near London, wherein is proposed a new Method of Repairing and Maintaining them ;&nbsp;read before the Royal Society in the winter of 1736-37, by&nbsp;Robert Phillips, and printed in a small separate volume.&nbsp;The author’s great object is to recommend washing the&nbsp;roads by a constant stream, if possible, and at any rate,&nbsp;washing the materials of which they are composed. In this&nbsp;respect, notwithstanding the existence of single roads so&nbsp;situated that the effects of water upon them have been very&nbsp;beneficially introduced, his plans for the universal employment of water have been altogether superseded by later experience ; but he remonstrates, with great propriety, against&nbsp;the practice, which has, however, continued to prevail so&nbsp;generally even of late years, of laying down large heaps of&nbsp;unprepared gravel, to be gradually consolidated into a harder&nbsp;mass, at the expense of the intolerable labour of the poor&nbsp;animals that are obliged to grind it down. As an illustration of the good effect of water, he mentions that even the&nbsp;sediment deposited by it at the bottom of Fleetditch, which&nbsp;was supposed to be a soft mud, and to require removal when&nbsp;the ditch was filled up, proved in fact to be a hard gravelly&nbsp;substance, which afterwards afforded an excellent foundation for the roads and buildings supported by it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The attention of the public has been more lately directed to the subject of roads and carriages, by several essays which appeared in the Communications to the Board of Agriculture ; they principally belong to the names of Beatson,&nbsp;Wright, Jessop, Hall, Wilkes, Erskine, Ellis, Cumming,&nbsp;Whetley, Amos, and Booth : the most remarkable are Mr&nbsp;Wilkes’s Remarks on the Advantages of Concave Roads ; Mr&nbsp;Ellis’s on Washing Roads ; Mr Wilkes’s on Railways ; and&nbsp;Mr Cumming’s on Wheel-Carriages ; showing particularly&nbsp;the disadvantage of broad conical wheels, and the historical&nbsp;progress of the practice of bending the line of the axes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But all these improvements, whether real or imaginary, have since been in a great measure superseded by the ingenuity and success of Mr Loudon Macadam, a gentleman&nbsp;whose practice is in general principally to be applauded for&nbsp;its obvious simplicity and economy, though he has also had&nbsp;the merit of discovering that the simplest and cheapest&nbsp;methods, in particular cases, especially in that of boggy&nbsp;soils, are also the most scientific and the most effectual.&nbsp;The practical observations, which are to be here inserted,&nbsp;cannot therefore be so well cxpressed in any other form, as&nbsp;in that of an abstract of Mr Macadam’s own directions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mr Macadam’s leading principles are (Remarks, p. 37), “ that a road ought to be considered as an artificial flooring,&nbsp;forming a strong, smooth, solid surface, at once capable of&nbsp;carrying great weights, and over which carriages may pass&nbsp;without meeting any impediment.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He proceeds to give directions for repairing an old road and for making a new one, in the form of a communication&nbsp;to a committee appointed by the House of Commons, in the&nbsp;year 1819, with some subsequent corrections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No additional materials, he observes, are to be brought upon a road, unless in any part of it there be not a quantity of clean stone equal to ten inches in thickness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The stone already in the road, supposing it to have been made in the usual manner, is to be loosened, and broken so&nbsp;that no piece may exceed six ounces in weight ; the road&nbsp;is then to be laid as flat as possible, leaving only a fall of&nbsp;three inches from the middle to the sides when the road&nbsp;is thirty feet wide. The stones, thus loosened, are to be&nbsp;dragged to the side by a strong heavy rake, with teeth two</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">inches and a half in length, and there broken ; but the stones are never to be broken on the road itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the great stones have been removed, and none are left exceeding six ounces in weight, the surface is to be&nbsp;made smooth by a rake, which will also settle the remaining materials into a better consistence, bringing up the&nbsp;stone, and letting the dirt fall down into its place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The road being so prepared, the stone that has been broken by the side is then to be carefully spread over it :&nbsp;this operation reqιdres very particular attention, and the&nbsp;future quality of the road will greatly depend on the manner in which it is performed ; the stone must not be laid on&nbsp;in shovels-full, but scattered over the surface, one shovel-full following another, and being spread over a considerable&nbsp;space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Only a small part of the length of the road should be </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lifted</span><span class="font0"> in this manner at once ; that is, about two or three&nbsp;yards ; five men in a gang should be employed to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lift</span><span class="font0"> it&nbsp;all across, two continually digging up and raking off the&nbsp;large stones, and preparing the road for receiving them&nbsp;again, and the other three breaking them at the side of the&nbsp;road. It may, however, happen that the surveyor may&nbsp;see cause to distribute the labour in a proportion somewhat&nbsp;different.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The only proper method of breaking stones, in general, both for effect and for economy, is in a sitting posture. The&nbsp;stones are to be placed in small heaps, and women, boys,&nbsp;and old men past hard labour, may sit down and break&nbsp;them witn small hammers into pieces not exceeding </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">six&nbsp;ounces</span><span class="font0"> in weight. When the heavy work of a quarry can&nbsp;be performed by men, and the lighter by their wives and&nbsp;children, the stone can be obtained by contract for two&nbsp;thirds of the former prices, although the stones were then&nbsp;left four times as large. It has also been recommended by&nbsp;Mr Macadam and others (p. 35), that the largest stone employed should not exceed the measure of an inch in its&nbsp;greatest dimensions, or, in other words, that it should be&nbsp;capable of being contained in a sphere of about an inch in&nbsp;diameter, which would seldom weigh more than a single&nbsp;ounce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In some cases it would bc unprofitable to lift and relay a road, even if the materials should have been originally too&nbsp;large ; for example, the road betwixt Bath and Cirencester&nbsp;was made of large stones, but so friable, that in lifting they&nbsp;w<sup>,</sup>ould have fallen into sand ; in this case Mr Macadam&nbsp;merely had the higher parts cut down, and replaced when&nbsp;sifted (p. 107), and the surface kept smooth, until those&nbsp;materials were gradually worn out ; and they were afterwards replaced by stone of a better quality, properly prepared. At Egham it was necessary to remove the whole&nbsp;road, in order to separate the small portion of valuable ma-tcrials from the mass of soft matter in which they were enveloped, and which was carried away, at a considerable expense, before a good road could be made. But although&nbsp;freestone is by no means calculated to make a durable road,&nbsp;yet by judicious management it may be made to form a very&nbsp;good road as long as it lasts. (P. 103.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Whenever new stone is to be laid on a road already consolidated, the hardened surface is to be loosened with a pick, in order to enable the fresh materials to unite with&nbsp;the old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A new road, however well it may have been made, will always receive the impressions of the carriage-wheels until&nbsp;it is hardened ; a careful person must, therefore, attend the&nbsp;road for some time, in order to rake in the tracks made by&nbsp;the wheels ; that is, as long as any loose materials are left&nbsp;that can be so employed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is always superfluous, and generally injurious, to add to the broken stone any mixture of earth, clay, chalk, or&nbsp;any other matter that will imbibe water and be affected by&nbsp;frost, or to lay any thing whatever on the clean stone for the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
