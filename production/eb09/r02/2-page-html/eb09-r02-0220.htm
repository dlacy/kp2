<p><span class="font0">of his situations and the names of the English localities in which his scenes are laid. Three other Spanish romances may be mentioned here. Though the earliest&nbsp;printed edition of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Oliveros y Artus</span><span class="font0"> is in French, the work&nbsp;(printed in Spanish at Burgos in 1499) is undoubtedly of&nbsp;Spanish origin. It has been popular in all languages. An&nbsp;English version came from the press of Wynkyn de Worde&nbsp;in 1518. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Felix Marte de Hyrcania</span><span class="font0"> (Valladolid, 1556), by&nbsp;Melchor Ortega, is chiefly remarkable as having been read&nbsp;by Dr Samuel Johnson, who is likely to have been the only&nbsp;person since the 16th century capable of such a feat. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Guerras de Granada</span><span class="font0"> (1595-1619) of Perez de Hita contains some of the finest ballads in the language, and is an&nbsp;interesting and well-written fiction. The first (and best)&nbsp;part deals with the reign of the last Moorish king of&nbsp;Granada, and the second part relates the final ruin of the&nbsp;Moors in Philip III.’s reign.—Another favourite fiction in&nbsp;many lands is that in which a chaste wife is wrongfully&nbsp;accused of infidelity and punished. The character even&nbsp;appears among the earliest ballads of the Charlemagne&nbsp;cycle (Z&lt;τ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">reine Sibelle)</span><span class="font0"> ; but here we have to mention&nbsp;three distinct narratives which have attracted generations&nbsp;of readers, and which are widely known from their adoption by many writers. These are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Patient Grizel (Griseldis),&nbsp;Genevieve of Brabant,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">La belle Helene.</span><span class="font0"> The story in&nbsp;each is similar, and the plot or some of the incidents may&nbsp;be traced in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lai del Fresne</span><span class="font0"> of Marie de France (c.&nbsp;1220), in the Latin legendary history of St Geneviève&nbsp;(written about 1272), in several old monkish lives of St&nbsp;Helena of Constantinople, in the late romances of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Valentine&nbsp;and Orson, Florent et Lyon,</span><span class="font0"> and other stories,—the heroine&nbsp;being variously described as the Chaste Empress, the Chaste&nbsp;Queen, or the Chaste Duchess. The most celebrated of&nbsp;these stories is that of Griseldis. She is said to have been&nbsp;the wife of Walter, marquis of Saluces or Saluzzo, in the&nbsp;llth century, and her misfortunes were considered to&nbsp;belong to actual history when they were handled by Boccaccio and Petrarch, although the probability is that Boccaccio borrowed his narrative from a Provençal </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fabliau.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">He included it in the recitations of the tenth day </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Deca-merone),</span><span class="font0"> and must have written it about 1350. Petrarch&nbsp;Latinized it in 1373, and his translation formed the basis&nbsp;of much of the later literature. These works, however,&nbsp;really belong to a different class from that treated here,&nbsp;and may be referred to popular tales, like the narratives&nbsp;which have been repeated in many forms and in many&nbsp;lands from the time of Bidpai downwards. The prose&nbsp;French romance, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">La Patience de Griselidis</span><span class="font0"> (Bréhan-Loudéac,&nbsp;1484), was derived from Petrarch, as also Chaucer’s narrative in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Canterbury Tales,</span><span class="font0"> and the Elizabethan drama&nbsp;in which Dekker was a collaborateur.—The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Duobus&nbsp;Amantibus</span><span class="font0"> (or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eurialus and Lucretiaj</span><span class="font0"> of Æneas Sylvius&nbsp;is usually included amongst romances, but it is rather an&nbsp;historical novel based upon the imperial court gossip of&nbsp;his own day.—The Spanish </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Carcel de Amor,</span><span class="font0"> composed&nbsp;about 1480-90 by Diego de San Pedro, is also a novel;&nbsp;the famous or infamous </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cdestina</span><span class="font0"> is a drama of surpassing&nbsp;vigour and interest ; and the pastoral romances of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Diana,&nbsp;Pastor Fido,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Arcadia</span><span class="font0"> belong to a different class from&nbsp;that of mediæval romance.—As much may be said of the&nbsp;English romances produced in the 16th and the earlier&nbsp;part of the 17th century, which are chiefly weak novelistic&nbsp;imitations of the later adjuncts to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Amαdis</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Palmerin.—&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Seven Champions of Christendom</span><span class="font0"> is a popular tale.—&nbsp;The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Romance of the Fox {Reynard the Fox)</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Roman&nbsp;de la Rose</span><span class="font0"> likewise belong to totally distinct orders of&nbsp;literature, the former to that of tales ( </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Volksbücher)</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;the latter to the large class of allegorical poems.—The&nbsp;Norman stories of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Robert the Devil</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Robert of Sicily&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">are also popular tales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">III. Modern Romance to the 17th Century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The inspiration of mediæval romance is gone ; but it is necessary briefly to trace its final reflexions to the close&nbsp;of the 17 th century, when prose fiction began to assume&nbsp;more definitely the character of the modern novel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have seen how large a place in the history of romances is occupied by France down to the end of the&nbsp;16th century. We first meet with the so-called “pastoral&nbsp;romance” in French in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">HAstree</span><span class="font0"> (1612) of Honoré d’Urfé,&nbsp;an enormous work inspired by Montemayor, which, however, La Rochefoucauld found interesting. It was frequently reprinted and had many continuations and imitations. Camus de Pontcarré wrote in opposition religious&nbsp;pastorals such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Palombe.</span><span class="font0"> ∙ To the same class belong&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Florù et Cleonthe</span><span class="font0"> (1613) by Moulinet du Parc, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Les Bergeries&nbsp;de Vesper</span><span class="font0"> (1618) by G. Coste, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chryserionte de Gaule</span><span class="font0"> (1620)&nbsp;by De Sonan, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Le Courtisan Solitaire</span><span class="font0"> (1622) by J. Lourdelot,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Le Mêlante</span><span class="font0"> (1624) by L. Videl, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">L'Endimion</span><span class="font0"> (1624) by J.&nbsp;Ogier de Gombauld, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cleomèdes et Sophonisbe</span><span class="font0"> (1627) by De&nbsp;Gerzan, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Le Berger Extravagant</span><span class="font0"> (1627) by Ch. Sorel, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anax-andre et Grazie</span><span class="font0"> (1629) by Boisrobert, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ariane</span><span class="font0"> (1632) and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Roxane</span><span class="font0"> (1639) by J. Des Marets. Le Roy de Gomberville&nbsp;led the way to the new school of French romance in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Polexaηdre</span><span class="font0"> (1632-39) and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">La Cytheree</span><span class="font0"> (1640-42), which&nbsp;were the models for the still more ponderous productions&nbsp;of La Calprenède and De Scudéry. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">La jeune Alcidiane&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1651), an unfinished continuation of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Polexaηdre,</span><span class="font0"> was completed by Mademoiselle M. A. Gomez. These form a link&nbsp;between the genuine romance of chivalry and the so-called&nbsp;heroic style. We still meet with giants and extravagant&nbsp;exploits. The adventures with pirates and the sea scenes&nbsp;show the influence of translations of Greek novels. Madeleine de Scudéry produced her romances under the name&nbsp;of her eccentric brother Georges, but the authorship was&nbsp;well known. The first to appear was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ibrahim, ou VIllustre&nbsp;Passa</span><span class="font0"> (1641); then the work for which she is best known,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aitamène, ou le Grand Cyrus</span><span class="font0"> (10 vols., 1649-53); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Clelie,&nbsp;histoire romaine</span><span class="font0"> (10 vols., 1650-53), contains the famous&nbsp;“carte du pays de Tendre”; then came </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Almahide, ou&nbsp;VEsclave Reyne</span><span class="font0"> (1660), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Les Femmes Illustres</span><span class="font0"> (1665), and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">La Promenade de Versailles</span><span class="font0"> (1669). One of the causes&nbsp;of her great popularity was her representation of living&nbsp;characters under flimsy disguise. Keys to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Le Grand Cyrus&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">have been published. Gauthier de Costes, chevalier de&nbsp;la Calprenède, wrote </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cassandre</span><span class="font0"> (1642-50); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cléopâtre</span><span class="font0"> (12&nbsp;vols., 1647-58), the best of his works, which contains the&nbsp;character of Juba satirized by Boileau; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Faramond</span><span class="font0"> (12&nbsp;vols., 1661-70), continued by Pierre Dortigue de Vau-morière; and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Les Nouvelles</span><span class="font0"> (1661). In spite of their&nbsp;appalling length and their tedious conversations and descriptions, La Calprenède’s romances are not without merit.&nbsp;The author has imagination, and his heroes have a share&nbsp;of the noble sentiments of their predecessors. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Berenice&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1648) by J. R. de Segrais, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">La Précieuse</span><span class="font0"> (1656-58) by&nbsp;Mich, de Pure, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire du Temps</span><span class="font0"> (1654) and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Marcarise&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1664), both by Hédelin, and the mystical romances of the&nbsp;Jesuit Ceriziers, belong to the same school. Nearly all&nbsp;the familiar machinery of the old romances is now absent :&nbsp;we no longer meet with dragons, necromancers, giants, and&nbsp;enchanted castles. Formerly love was secondary to heroic&nbsp;achievement ; now it becomes the ruling passion, and&nbsp;knightly deeds are performed only to excite the applauding smile of a mistress and not for the sake of military&nbsp;glory. The jargon of gallantry used in these fictions&nbsp;exercised an evil influence upon contemporary literature,&nbsp;until it was laughed out of existence by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Précieuses&nbsp;Ridicules</span><span class="font0"> of Molière and the dialogue of Boileau on </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Les&nbsp;Héros de Roman.</span><span class="font0"> Such works as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Marie Stuart</span><span class="font0"> (1675) by&nbsp;P. Le Pesant de Boisguilbert, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nouvelles d<sup>,</sup>Elisabeth</span><span class="font0"> (1680),</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
