The europæa, or nuthatch, is in length near five inches three-quarters, in breadth nine inches ; the bill is ſtrong and ſtraight, about three-quarters of an inch long ; the upper mandible black, the lower white : the irides are hazel ; the crown of the head, back, and coverts of the wings, of a fine bluiſh grey ; a black ſtroke passes over the eye from the mouth : the cheeks and chin are white ; the breaſt and belly of a dull orange-colour ; the quill-feathers duſky ; the wings underneath are marked with two ſpots, one white at the root of the exterior quills, the other black at the joint of the baſtard-wing ; the tail conſiſts of twelve feathers ; the two middle are grey, the two exterior feathers tipt with grey ; then ſucceeds a tranſverſe white ſpot ; beneath that the reſt is black : the legs are of a pale yellow ; the back toe very ſtrong, and the claws large. The female is like the male, but leſs in ſize, and weighs commonly 5 or at moſt 6 drams. The eggs are ſix or ſeven in number, of a dirty white, dotted with rufous ; theſe are depoſited in ſome hole of a tree, frequently one which has been deſerted by a woodpecker, on the rotten wood mixed with a little moſs, &amp;c. If the entrance be too large, the bird nicely ſtops up part of it with clay, leaving only a ſmall hole for itſelf to paſs in and out by. While the hen is fitting, if any one puts a bit of ſtick into the hole, ſhe hisses like a ſnake, and is ſo attached to her eggs, that ſhe will ſooner ſuffer any one to pluck off her feathers than fly away. During the time of incubation, the male ſupplies her with ſuſtenance, with all the tenderneſs of an affectionate mate.</p><p>The bird runs up and down the bodies of trees, like the woodpecker tribe ; and feeds not only on infects, but nuts, of which it lays up a conſiderable proviſion in the hollows of trees. “ It is a pretty fight, ſays Mr Willoughby, to ſee her fetch a nut out of her hoard, place it faſt in a chink, and then, ſtanding above it with its head downwards, ſtriking it with all its force, break the ſhell, and catch up the kernel. It is ſuppoſed not to ſleep perched on a twig like other birds ; for when confined in a cage, it prefers ſleeping in a hole or corner. When at reſt it keeps the head down. In autumn it begins to make a chattering noiſe, being silent for the greateſt part of the year.” Dr Plott tells us, that this bird, by putting its bill into a crack in the bough of a tree, can make ſuch a violent found as if it was rending aſunder, ſo that the noiſe may be heard at leaſt twelve ſcore yards.</p><p>SITOPHYLAX, Σιτοφυλαέ formed from οιτος “corn,” and φυλαέ, " keeper,” in antiquity, an Athenian magistrate, who had the ſuperintendence of the corn, and was to take care that nobody bought more than was neceſſary for the proviſion of his family. By the Attic laws, particular perſons were prohibited from buying more than fifty meaſures of wheat a man ; and that ſuch perſons might not purchaſe more, the ſitophylax was appointed to ſee the laws properly executed. It was a capital crime to prevaricate in it. There were 15 of theſe <hi rend="italic">ſitophylaces,</hi> ten for the city, and five for the Pireaeus.</p><p>SIVA, a name given by the Hindoos to the Supreme</p><p>Being, when conſidered as the avenger or deſtroyer. Sir William Jones has ſhown that in ſeveral reſpects the character of Jupiter and Siva are the ſame. @@As Jupiter overthrew the Titans and giants, ſo did Siva overthrow the Daityas, or children of Diti, who frequently rebelled againſt Heaven ; and as during the conteſt the god of Olympus was furniſhed with lightning and thunderbolts by an eagle, ſo Brahma, who is ſometimes repreſented riding on the Garuda, or eagle, presented the god of deſtruction with fiery ſhafts. Siva alſo correſponds with the Stygian Jove, or Pluto ; for, if we can  rely on a Perſian tranſlation of the Bhagavat, the ſovereign of Pâtâla, or the infernal regions, is the king of ſerpents, named <hi rend="italic">Seſhanaga,</hi> who is exhibited in painting and ſculpture, with a diadem and ſceptre, in the same manner as Pluto. There is yet another attribute of Siva, or Mahadéva, by which he is viſibly diſtinguiſhed in the drawings and temples of Bengal. To deſtroy, according to the Vedantis of India, the Sufis of Perſia, and many philoſophers of our European ſchools, is only to generate and reproduce in another form. Hence the god of deſtruction is holden in this country to preside over generation, as a ſymbol of which he rides on a white bull. Can we doubt that the loves and feats of Jupiter Genitor (not forgetting the white bull of Europa), and his extraordinary title of Lapis, for which no ſatisfactory reaſon is commonly given, have a connection with the Indian philoſophy and mythology ?</p><p>SIUM, <hi rend="smallcaps">Water Parsnep,</hi> in botany: A genus of plants belonging to the claſs of <hi rend="italic">pentandria,</hi> and order of <hi rend="italic">digynia,</hi> and in the natural ſyſtem ranging under the 45th order, <hi rend="italic">Umbellate.</hi> The fruit is a little ovated, and ſtreaked. The involucrum is polyphyllous, and the petals are heart-ſhaped. There are 12 ſpecies ; the latifolium, anguſtifolium, nodiflorum, ſiſarum, ninſi, rigidius, japonicum, falearica, græcum, ſiculum, repens, and decumbens. The three firſt are natives of Britain. I. The <hi rend="italic">latifolium,</hi> or great water-parſnep, which grows ſpontaneouſly in many places both of England and Scotland on the ſides of lakes, ponds, and rivulets. The ſtalk is erect and furrowed, a yard high or more. The leaves are pinnated with three or four pair of large elliptic pinnæ, with an odd one at the end, all ſerrated on the edges. The ſtalk and branches are terminated with erect umbels, which is the chief characteriſtic of the ſpecies. Cattle are ſaid to have run mad by feeding upon this plant. 2. The <hi rend="italic">angustifolium,</hi> or narrowleaved water-parſnep, has pinnated leaves ; the axillary umbels are pedunculated, and the general involucrum is pinnatifid. It grows in ditches and rivulets, but is not common. 3. The <hi rend="italic">nodiflorum,</hi> reclining water-parſnep, has pinnated leaves, but the axillary umbels are ſeſſile. It grows on the ſides of rivulets.</p><p>The si<hi rend="italic">um ſiſarum,</hi> or ſkirret, is a native of China, but has been for a long time cultivated in Europe, and particularly in Germany. The root is a bunch of fleſhy fibres, each of which is about as thick as a finger, but very uneven, covered with a whitiſh rough bark, and has a hard core or pith running thro' the centre. From the crown of this bunch come ſeveral winged leaves, conſiſting of two or three pair of oblong dentated lobes each, and terminated by an odd one. The ſtalk riſes to about two feet, is ſet with leaves at the joints, and breaks into branches towards the top, each terminating with an umbel of ſmall white flowers, which are ſucceeded by ſtriated</p><p>@@@[mu] Asiatic Researches,.</p></body></text></TEI>
