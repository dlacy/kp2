God, they say, being perfectly benevolent, never punished the wicked otherwise than by the pain and affliction which are the natural consequences of evil actions ; and hell, therefore, is no other than a consciousness of evil.</p><p>The Neadirsen Shaster is said to have been written by a philosopher called Goutam, nearly four thousand years ago. The Brahmins, from Mr Dowâ€™s account of their sacred books, appear to believe invariably in the unity, eternity, omniscience, and omnipotence of God ; and the polytheism of which they have been accused is no more than a symbolical worship of the divine attributes, which they divide into three classes. Under the name of Brahma, they worship the wisdom and creative power of God ; under the appellation of Vishen, his providential and preserving quality ; and under that of Shevah, that attribute which tends to destroy.</p><p>SHAT-UL-ARAB, a large river, or rather canal, formed by the confluence of the Euphrates and the Tigris, before they enter the Persian Gulf. It forms a broad and splendid stream ; and as far as Bassora, seventy miles from its mouth, it is navigable for vessels of 500 tons burden, It is generally supposed to fall into the Persian Gulf by various mouths; but this Colonel Kinneir, in his Geographical Memoir of the Persian Empire, shows to be a mistake, as those streams, supposed to be the mouths of the Shat-ul- Arab, are really the channels through which the great river Karoon pours its waters into the Gulf. With these six eastern channels the Shat-ul-Arab communicates by an artificial cut, and receives the waters of the Karoon.</p><p>SHAW, <hi rend="smallcaps">Dr Thomas</hi>, known to the learned world by his Travels to Barbary and the Levant, was bom at Kendal, in Westmoreland, about the year 1692. He was appointed chaplain to the English consul at Algiers, in which station he continued for several years ; and thence took proper opportunities of travelling into different parts. He returned in 1733, was elected fellow of the Royal Society, and published the account of his travels at Oxford, 1738, folio. In 1740 he was nominated principal of St Edmond Hall, which he raised from a ruinous state by his munificence ; and was regius professor of Greek at Oxford until his death, which happened in 1751. Dr Clayton, bishop of Clogher, having attacked these Travels in his Description of the East, Dr Shaw published, by way of vindication, a supplement, which is incorporated into the second edition of his Travels, prepared by himself, and published in 1757, 4to.</p><p>SHAWABAD, a district of Hindustan, in the province of Bahar, situated principally between the 25th and 26th degrees of north latitude. It has the Ganges on the north, Rotas and Bahar on the south, the district of Bahar on the east, and Chunar and Rotas on the west. This is a populous and fertile country, particularly in the northern quarter, which is watered by the Ganges and the Soane. In answer to queries circulated by the Marquis Wellesley to the collectors of the districts in 1801, it appeared that the population amounted to two millions, in the proportion of one Mahommedan to twenty Hindus. The principal towns are Buxar, Boujepoor, and Arrah ; and the chief rivers are the Ganges, Soane, and Caramnassa.</p><p>SHAWLS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Figured.</hi> This article has, within less than forty years, become a very considerable branch of our manufactures. For a long period the district of Cashmere, a province of Hindustan, formerly subject to the king of Canda- har, produced articles of this description in such perfection as to make them highly prized both in Europe and in Asia. The date at which this manufacture took its rise is not known ;</p><p>but ever since the British established themselves in India, Cashmere shawls have been considered as one of the most valuable manufactures of the East.</p><p>These shawls are made both long and square, the former generally measuring fifty-four inches wide, and a hundred and twenty-six long; the latter are from sixty-three to seventy-two ioches square. The finest of them are composed of a material exquisitely soft and warm, surpassing in this respect probably any other material that has ever been fabricated into clothing. It is recorded that, at the most flourishing period of this manufacture, the district of Cashmere had not less than 40,000 looms or frames employed in it. This district produced also a fine article of cloth, which has also been imitated in this country, and is in extensive use, called Cashmeres or Cassimeres. These manufactures were sufficient to draw to the district of Cashmere, merchants and commercial agents from Northern India, Turkey, Persia, and Tartary ; and the increasing prosperity of this industrious and ingenious people was only checked by the oppressions of their own government, or the rapacity of the bordering states.</p><p>These shawls were not more prized for their fine, soft texture, than for the chaste beautiful-coloured flowering with which they were ornamented. Long practice, united to a natural delicacy of taste, enabled the manufacturers to dye the numerous colours of an unfading and brilliant hue, and to arrange them in such a manner as to produce a harmony and elegance such as no article made in Europe has ever fully equalled. The value put upon them by the traders who brought them to the different markets runs from L.5 to L.100, and those of the finest texture and greatest extent of figure sold for still higher prices. At a time when there was a duty of eighty per cent. upon their importation into this country (when, however, many were smuggled), a celebrated dealer in the article in London possessed a shawl for which he asked five hundred guineas.@@*</p><p>As this country became more and more engaged in a variety of manufactures, and the ingenuity of so many persons was put upon the stretch, it was but natural that attention should be turned to a manufacture at once so curious and so much prized. It was long before the manufacturers of this country ascertained the material of which the Cashmerian shawls were made, or by what process they were fabricated ; and hence the first specimens that were produced in imitation of them in this country were very inferior. The merit of commencing, and bringing to a high degree of perfection, British shawls, belongs exclusively to Edinburgh, and the principal seat of the manufacture all along has been in Scotland. About thirty-four years ago the late Miss Bowie, who, with her father, had for a number of years been engaged in the gold-lace manufacture, attempted to make square shawls of the more simple patterns, in imitation of the Cashmere, by means of the sewing-needle, from a fabric made of silk, spun from the waste made in reeling the finest Italian silk. This plan was tedious and expensive, and in effect fell far short of the originals.</p><p>The manufacture of damask had been carried on in Edinburgh for a long period. The process by which the figures are produced in this elegant fabric first suggested the idea that a similar contrivance might produce a close imitation of the Indian shawls, both in the form of the figures and the distribution of the colours attained. To accomplish this, and to train children to insert the coloured yam with their fingers, were simultaneously attempted by several manufacturers in Edinburgh ; but although this article was manufactured by means of the fingers in Cashmere, it was soon found that the higher price of labour in Britain ren-</p><p><hi rend="superscript smallcaps">@@@,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"> The duty is now (1840) thirty per cent.</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
