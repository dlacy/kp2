For it is to be obſerved, that the benefit of this ſociety is by no means confined to the two caſes of drowning and ſuſpenſion. Its timely ſuccours have rouſed the lethargy of opium taken in immoderate and repeated doſes ; they have reſcued the wretched victims of intoxication ; rekindled the life extinguiſhed by the ſudden ſtroke of lightning ; recovered the apoplectic ; reſtored life to the infant that had lost it in the birth ; they have proved efficacious in caſes of accidental ſmothering and of ſuffocation by noxious damps ; in instances in which the tenderneſs of the infant body or the debility of old age greatly leſſened the previous probability of ſucceſs ; inſomuch that no ſpecies of death ſeems to be placed beyond the reach of this Society’s aſſiſtance, where the miſchief had gone no farther than an obſtruction of the movements of the animal machine without any damage of the organs themſelves. In conſequence of every neceſſary aſſiſtance afforded by this ſociety, similar inſtitutions have been eſtabliſhed at Algiers, Liſhon, Philadelphia, Boſton, Jamaica, Dublin, Leith, Glaſgow, Aberdeen, Birmingham, Glouceſter, Shropſhire, Northamptonſhire, Lancaſter, Briſtol, Whitehaven, Norwich, Exeter, Kent and Newcaſtle. The ſociety has publiſhed an 8vo volume with plates, conſiſting of caſes, correſpondence, and a variety of intereſting matter relating to the object of this benevolent inſtitution.</p><p>6. <hi rend="italic">The Philanthropic Society,</hi> was inſtituted in September 1788. It aims at the prevention of crimes, by removing out of the way of evil counſel, and evil company, thoſe children who are, in the preſent ſtate of things, deſtined to ruin. It propoſes to educate and inſtruct in ſome uſeful trade or occupation the children of convicts or other infant poor who are engaged in vagrant or criminal courſes ; thus to break the chain of thoſe pernicious confederacies, deprive the wicked of ſucceſſors, the gaols of inhabitants, juſtice of its victims, and by all theſe means add citizens to ſociety. This inſtitution is not only calculated to decreaſe vice and infamy, but to increaſe uſeful induſtry ; ſo that thoſe children who would otherwiſe ſucceed to their parents hereditary crimes, and become the next race of beggars and thieves, will now be taught to ſupply by honeſt means their own wants and the wants of others.</p><p>To carry into effect theſe desirable purpoſes, it is the  firſt bufineſs of the ſociety to ſelect from priſons, and from the haunts of vice, profligacy, and beggary, ſuch objects as appear moſt likely to become obnoxious to the laws, or prejudicial to the community ; and, in the execution of this duty, the aſſiſtance of the magiſtrates, the clergy, and all who are intereſted in the promotion of good morals and good government, is moſt earneſtly requeſted. For the employment of the children, ſeveral houſes are ſupported, at Cambridge Heath, near Hackney, in each of which a maſter-workman is placed for the purpoſe of teaching the children ſome uſeful trade. The trades already eſtabliſhed are thoſe of a printer, carpenter, ſhoemaker, and taylor. The girls are at preſent educated as menial ſervants.</p><p>In the year 1791 no less than 70 children were un</p><p>der the protection of this ſociety, among whom were many who have been guilty of various felonies, burglaries, and other crimes. Yet, singular as it may appear, in leſs than two years thoſe very children became no leſs remarkable for induſtry, activity, decency, and obedience, than they formerly were for the contrary vices. Such are the grounds on which the Philanthropic Society now claims the attention and ſolicits the patronage of the public. If we regard humanity and religion, this inſtitution opens an aſylum to the moſt forlorn and abject of the human race ; it befriends the moſt friendleſs ; it ſaves from the certain and fatal conſequences of infamy ard vicious courſes orphans and deſerted children. If we regard national proſperity and the public welfare, it is calculated to increaſe induſtry ; and it directs that induſtry into the moſt uſeful and neceſſary channels. If we regard ſelf-intereſt, its immediate object is to protect our perſons from assault and murder, our property from depredation, and our peaceful habitations from the deſperate fury oſ midnight incendiaries.</p><p>One guinea <hi rend="italic">per annum</hi> conſtitutes a member of the ſociety ; and L. 10 at one payment a member for life. A life-ſubſcription, or an annual payment of at leaſt two guineas, is a neceſſary qualification for being elected into the committee.</p><p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Societies for Promoting Science and Literature.</hi></p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Royal Society of London</hi> is an academy or body of perſons of eminent learning, inſtituted by Charles II. for the promoting of natural knowledge. The origin of this ſociety is traced by Dr Sprat, its earlieſt historian, no farther back than to “ ſome ſpace after the end of the civil wars” in the laſt century. The ſcene of the firſt meetings of the learned men who laid the foundation of it, is by him fixed in the univerſity of Oxford at the lodgings of Dr Wilkins warden of Wadham college. But Dr Birch, on the authority of Dr Wallis, one of its earlieſt and moſt considerable members, aſſigns it an earlier origin. According to him, certain worthy perſons, refilling in London about the year 1645, being “ inquiſitive into natural and the new and experimental philoſophy, agreed to meet weekly on a certain day, to discourſe upon such ſubjects, and were known by the title of <hi rend="italic">The Invisible</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Philoſophical College.”</hi> In the years 1648 and 1649, the company who formed theſe meetings were divided, part retiring to Oxford and part remaining in London ; but they continued the ſame purſuits as when united, correſponding with each other, and giving a mutual account of their reſpective discoveries. About the year 1659 the greater part of the Oxford ſociety returned to London, and again uniting with their fellow-labourers, met once, if not twice, a-week at Greſham college, during term time, till they were ſcattered by the public diſtractions of that year, and the place of their meeting made a quarter for ſoldiers. On the reſtoration 1660 their meetings were revived, and attended by a greater concourſe of men eminent for their rank and learning. They were at laſt taken notice of by the king, who having himſelf a conſiderable taſte for phyſical ſcience, was pleaſed to grant them an ample charter, dated the 15th of July 1662, and afterwards a ſecond dated 15th April 1763, by which they were erected into a corρo-</p></body></text></TEI>
