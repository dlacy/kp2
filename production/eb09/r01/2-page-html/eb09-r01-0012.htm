<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">pet dogs than in those which are less domesticated, hut in all the remission is so complete after the first paroxysm that the animals&nbsp;appear to be almost well, if not in perfect health. During the&nbsp;paroxysms respiration is hurried and laboured, but tranquil during&nbsp;the remissions. There is an increase of temperature and the pulse&nbsp;is quick and hard. When the animal is kept in a dark place and&nbsp;not excited, the fits of fury are not observed. Sometimes it is&nbsp;agitated and restless in the manner already described. It never&nbsp;becomes really furious or aggressive unless excited by external&nbsp;objects,—the most potent of these, as has been said, being another&nbsp;dog, which, however, if it be admitted to its cage, it may not at&nbsp;once attack. The attacked animal rarely retaliates, but usually&nbsp;responds to the bites by acute yells, which contrast strangely with&nbsp;the silent anger of the aggressor, and tries to hide its head with&nbsp;its paws or beneath the straw. These repeated paroxysms hurry&nbsp;the course of the disease. The secretion and flowing of a large&nbsp;quantity of saliva from the mouth are usually only witnessed in&nbsp;cases in which swallowing has become impossible, the mouth being&nbsp;generally dry. At times the tongue, nose, and whole head appear&nbsp;swollen. Other dogs frequently shun one which is rabid, as if&nbsp;aware of their danger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The rabid dog, if lodged in a room or kept in a house, is continually endeavouring to escape; and when it makes its escape it goes freely&nbsp;forward, as if impelled by some irresistible force. It travels considerable distances in a short time, perhaps attacking every living&nbsp;creature it meets,—preferring dogs, however, to other animals, and&nbsp;these to mankind ; cats, sheep, cattle, and horses are particularly&nbsp;liable to be injured. It attacks in silence, and never utters a&nbsp;snarl or a cry of anger; should it chance to be hurt in return it&nbsp;emits no cry or howl of pain. The degree of ferocity appears to be&nbsp;related to natural disposition and training. Some dogs, for instance,&nbsp;will only snap or give a slight bite in passing, while others will&nbsp;bite furiously, tearing the objects presented to them, or which they&nbsp;meet in their way, and sometimes with such violence as to injure&nbsp;their mouth and break their teeth, or even their jaws. If chained,&nbsp;they will in some cases gnaw the chain until their teeth are worn&nbsp;away and the bones laid bare. The rabid dog does not continue&nbsp;its progress very long. Exhausted by fatigue and the paroxysms&nbsp;of madness excited in it by the objects it meets, as well as by&nbsp;hunger, thirst, and also, no doubt, by the malady, its limbs soon&nbsp;become feeble; the rate of travelling is lessened and the walk is&nbsp;unsteady, while its drooping tail, head inclined towards the ground,&nbsp;open mouth, and protruded tongue (of a leaden colour or covered with&nbsp;dust) give the distressed creature a very striking and characteristic&nbsp;physiognomy. In this condition, however, it is much less to be&nbsp;dreaded than in its early fits of fury, since it is no longer capable&nbsp;or desirous of altering its course or going out of its way to attack&nbsp;an animal or a man not immediately in the path. It is very&nbsp;probable that its fast-failing vision, deadened scent, and generally&nbsp;diminished perception prevent its being so readily impressed or&nbsp;excited by surrounding objects as it previously was. To each</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">S</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">aroxysm, which is always of short duration, there succeeds a egree of exhaustion as great as the fits have been violent and&nbsp;oft repeated. This compels the animal to stop; then it shelters&nbsp;itself in obscure places—frequently in ditches by the roadside—and&nbsp;lies there in a somnolescent state for perhaps hours. There is great&nbsp;danger, nevertheless, in disturbing the dog at this period; for when&nbsp;roused from its torpor it has sometimes sufficient strength to inflict a bite. This period, which may be termed the second stage,&nbsp;is as variable in its duration as the first, but it rarely exceeds&nbsp;three or four days. The above-described phenomena gradually&nbsp;merge into those of the third or last period, when symptoms of&nbsp;paralysis appear, which are speedily followed by death. During&nbsp;the remission in the paroxysms these paralytic symptoms are more&nbsp;particularly manifested in the hind limbs, which appear as if unable to support the animal’s weight, and cause it to stagger about;&nbsp;or the lower jaw becomes more or less drooping, leaving the&nbsp;parched mouth partially open. Emaciation rapidly sets in, and&nbsp;the paroxysms diminish in intensity, while the remissions become&nbsp;less marked. The physiognomy assumes a still more sinister and&nbsp;repulsive aspect; the hair is dull and erect; the flanks are retracted ; the eyes lose their lustre and are buried in the orbits,&nbsp;the pupil being dilated, and the cornea dull and semi-opaque ; very&nbsp;often, even at an early period, the eyes squint, and this adds still&nbsp;more to the terrifying appearance of the poor dog. The voice, if at&nbsp;all heard, is husky, the breathing laborious, and the pulse hurried&nbsp;and irregular. Gradually the paralysis increases, and the posterior&nbsp;extremities are dragged as if the animal’s back were broken, until&nbsp;at length it becomes general; it is then the prelude to death. Or&nbsp;the dog remains lying in a state of stupor, and can only raise itself&nbsp;with difficulty on the fore-limbs when greatly excited. In this&nbsp;condition it may yet endeavour to bite at objects within its reach.&nbsp;At times convulsions of a tetanic character appear in certain&nbsp;muscles ; at other times these are general. A comatose condition&nbsp;ensues, and the rabid dog, if permitted to die naturally, perishes,&nbsp;in the great majority of cases, from paralysis and asphyxia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">In dumb madness there is paralysis of the lower jaw, which imparts a curious and very characteristic physiognomy to the dog; the voice is also lost, and the animal can neither eat nor drink.&nbsp;In this condition the creature remains with its jaw pendent and&nbsp;the mouth consequently wide open, showing the flaccid or swollen&nbsp;tongue covered with brownish matter, and a stringy gelatinous-looking saliva lying between it and the lower lip and coating the&nbsp;fauces, which sometimes appear to be inflamed. Though the&nbsp;animal is unable to swallow fluids, the desire to drink is nevertheless intense ; for the creature will thrust its face into the vessel of&nbsp;water in futile attempts to obtain relief, even until the approach&nbsp;of death. Water maybe poured down its throat without inducing&nbsp;a paroxysm. The general physiognomy and demeanour of the poor&nbsp;creature inspire the beholder with pity rather than fear. The&nbsp;symptoms due to cerebral excitement are less marked than in the&nbsp;furious form of the disease; the agitation is not so considerable,&nbsp;and the restlessness, tendency to run away, and desire to bite are&nbsp;nearly absent; generally the animal is quite passive. Not !infrequently one or both eyes squint, and it is only when very much&nbsp;excited that the dog may contrive to close its mouth. Sometimes&nbsp;there is swelling about the pharynx and the neck ; when the&nbsp;tongue shares in this complication it hangs out of the mouth. In&nbsp;certain cases there is a catarrhal condition of the membrane lining&nbsp;the nasal cavities, larynx, and bronchi; sometimes the animal&nbsp;testifies to the existence of abdominal pain, and the faeces are then&nbsp;soft or fluid. The other symptoms—such as the rapid exhaustion&nbsp;and emaciation, paralysis of the posterior limbs towards the termination of the disease, as well as the rapidity with which it runs&nbsp;its course—are the same as in the furious form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The simultaneous occurrence of furious and dumb madness is frequently observed in packs of fox-hounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dumb madness</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">differs, then, from the furious type in the paralysis of the lower jaw, which hinders the dog from biting, save in very exceptional&nbsp;circumstances; the ferocious instincts are also in abeyance ; and&nbsp;there is no tendency to aggression. It has been calculated that&nbsp;from 15 to 20 per cent, of rabid dogs have this particular form of&nbsp;the disease. Puppies and young dogs chiefly have furious rabies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">These are the symptoms of rabies in the dog; but it is not likely, nor is it necessary, that they will all be present in every case. In&nbsp;other species the symptoms differ more or less from those manifested by the dog, but they are generally marked by a change in&nbsp;the manner and habits of the creatures affected, with strong indications of nervous disturbance, in the majority of species amounting&nbsp;to ferociousness and a desire to injure, timid creatures becoming&nbsp;bold and aggressive. (See Fleming, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rabies and Hydrophobia.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In order to prevent injury from this disease in countries in which it is prevalent owners of dogs should be well&nbsp;acquainted with its symptoms, especially the premonitory&nbsp;ones j of these a change in the demeanour and habits of&nbsp;the animal—unusual irritability, depraved appetite, restlessness, and a tendency to wander from home—are the&nbsp;most marked. One of the chief police measures is diminution in the number of useless dogs. This is best&nbsp;enforced by the imposition of a dog-tax or licence, which&nbsp;may be large or small in proportion to the number of dogs&nbsp;or the urgency of the case. ^0n the licence-paper the&nbsp;chief symptoms of the malady should be described so as&nbsp;to warn dog-owners. Every dog should wear a collar&nbsp;with a brass plate, on which are inscribed the name and&nbsp;address of the owner as well as a police register-number&nbsp;stamped thereon, or some particular mark affixed by the&nbsp;police or inland revenue authorities, for purposes of identification ; all stray dogs without a collar of this description&nbsp;ought to be captured, and sold or destroyed after three or&nbsp;more days if not claimed. Blunting the canine and incisor&nbsp;teeth of dogs has also been proposed as a precautionary&nbsp;measure. All dogs suspected of rabies should be captured&nbsp;and, when the existence of the disease is confirmed, destroyed. Rabid dogs should be destroyed at once. It is&nbsp;also well as a precautionary measure to kill dogs or cats&nbsp;which have been bitten or “ worried ” by rabid animals.&nbsp;During an outbreak of rabies all dogs should be securely&nbsp;muzzled and if possible led. It is a great mistake to destroy immediately suspected dogs which have bitten people ;&nbsp;they should be kept until their condition is ascertained,&nbsp;as, if they are found to be healthy, this will greatly relieve&nbsp;the mind of those who have been bitten. Suspected dogs&nbsp;should be carefully kept under observation and frequently&nbsp;inspected by a veterinary surgeon or other competent per-</span></p>
