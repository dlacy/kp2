        <p><span class="font2">constituted as separate communities in alliance with Rome. In many
                cases, too, no freedom of trade or intermarriage&nbsp;was allowed between the allies
                themselves, a policy afterwards systematically pursued in the provinces. Nor
                were&nbsp;all these numerous allied communities placed on the same&nbsp;footing as
                regarded their relations with Rome herself. To&nbsp;begin with, a sharp distinction
                was drawn between the&nbsp;“ Latini ” and the general mass of Italian allies.
                The&nbsp;“ Latins ” of this period had little more than the name in&nbsp;common with
                the old thirty Latin peoples of the days of&nbsp;Spurius Cassius. With a few
                exceptions, such as Tibur&nbsp;and Præneste, the latter had either disappeared or
                had&nbsp;been incorporated with the Roman state, and the Latins&nbsp;of 268
                </span><span class="font0">B.c. </span><span class="font2">were almost exclusively
                the “ Latin colonies,”&nbsp;that is to say, communities founded by Rome,
                composed&nbsp;of men of Roman blood, and whose only claim to the title&nbsp;“ Latin
                ” lay in the fact that Rome granted to them some&nbsp;portion of the rights and
                privileges formerly enjoyed by&nbsp;the old Latin cities under the Cassian
                    treaty.@@<sup>1</sup> Though&nbsp;nominally allies, they were in fact offshoots
                of Rome&nbsp;herself, bound to her by community of race, language,
                and&nbsp;interest, and planted as Roman garrisons among alien and&nbsp;conquered
                peoples. The Roman citizen who joined a&nbsp;Latin colony lost his citizenship,—to
                have allowed him to&nbsp;retain it would no doubt have been regarded as
                enlarging&nbsp;too rapidly the limits of the citizen body; but he received
                in&nbsp;exchange the status of a favoured ally. The Latin colony&nbsp;did not indeed
                enjoy the equality and independence&nbsp;originally possessed by the old Latin
                cities. It had no&nbsp;freedom of action outside its own territory, could
                not&nbsp;make war or peace, and was bound to have the same&nbsp;friends and foes as
                Rome. But its members had the right&nbsp;of commercium and down to 268@@<sup>2</sup>
                of connubium also with&nbsp;Roman citizens. Provided they left sons and property
                to&nbsp;represent them at home, they were free to migrate to&nbsp;Rome and acquire
                the Roman franchise. In war time they&nbsp;not only shared in the booty, but claimed
                a portion of any&nbsp;land confiscated by Rome and declared “ public.”
                These&nbsp;privileges, coupled with their close natural affinities with&nbsp;Rome,
                successfully secured the fidelity of the Latin&nbsp;colonies, which became not only
                the most efficient props&nbsp;of Roman supremacy, but powerful agents in the
                work&nbsp;of Romanizing Italy. Below the privileged Latins stood&nbsp;the Italian
                allies ; and here again we know generally that&nbsp;there were considerable
                differences of status, determined&nbsp;in each case by the terms of their respective
                treaties with&nbsp;Rome. We are told that the Greek cities of Neapolis
                and&nbsp;Heraclea were among the most favoured ;@@<sup>3</sup> the Bruttii,
                on&nbsp;the other hand, seem, even before the Hannibalic war, to&nbsp;have been less
                generously treated. But beyond this the&nbsp;absence of all detailed information
                does not enable us to</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">gθ∙ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Rome, however, did not rely only on this policy of isola</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">tion. Her allies were attached as closely to herself as they were
                clearly separated from each other, and from the first&nbsp;she took every security
                for the maintenance of her own paramount authority. Within its own borders, each
                ally was&nbsp;left to manage its own affairs as an independent
                    state.@@<sup>4&nbsp;</sup>The badges which marked subjection to Rome in the
                provinces—the resident magistrate and the tribute—were&nbsp;unknown in Italy. But in
                all points affecting the relations&nbsp;of one ally with another, in all questions
                of the general</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">interests of Italy and of foreign policy, the decision rested solely
                with Rome. The place of a federal constitution, of&nbsp;a federal council, of
                federal officers, was filled by the Roman&nbsp;senate, assembly, and magistrates.
                The maintenance of&nbsp;peace and order in Italy, the defence of the coasts
                and&nbsp;frontiers, the making of war or peace with foreign powers,&nbsp;were
                matters the settlement of which Rome kept entirely&nbsp;in her own hands. Each
                allied state, in time of war, was&nbsp;called upon for a certain contingent of men,
                but, though&nbsp;its contingent usually formed a distinct corps under
                officers&nbsp;of its own, its numerical strength was fixed by Rome, it&nbsp;was
                brigaded with the Roman legions, and was under the&nbsp;orders of the Roman
                    consul.@@<sup>5</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">This paramount authority of Rome throughout the peninsula was
                confirmed and justified by the fact that Rome herself was now infinitely more
                powerful than any one&nbsp;of her numerous allies. Her territory, as distinct
                from&nbsp;that of the allied states, covered something like one-third&nbsp;of the
                peninsula south of the Æsis. Along the west&nbsp;coast it stretched from Cære to the
                southern borders of&nbsp;Campania. Inland, it included the former
                territories&nbsp;of the Æqui and Hernici, the Sabine country, and even&nbsp;extended
                eastward into Picenum, while beyond these&nbsp;limits were outlying districts, such
                as the lands of&nbsp;the Senonian Celts, with the Roman colony of Sena,&nbsp;and
                others elsewhere in Italy, which had been confiscated&nbsp;by Rome and given over to
                Roman settlers. Since&nbsp;the first important annexation of territory after
                the&nbsp;capture of Veii (396), twelve new tribes had been
                    formed,@@<sup>6&nbsp;</sup>and the number of male citizens registered at
                the&nbsp;census had risen from 152,000 to 290,OOO.@@<sup>7</sup> Within&nbsp;this
                enlarged Roman state were now included numerous&nbsp;communities with local
                institutions and government.&nbsp;At their head stood the Roman colonies
                (“coloniae&nbsp;civium Romanorum ”), founded to guard especially the&nbsp;coasts of
                Latium and Canqjania.@@<sup>8</sup> Next to these eldest&nbsp;children of Rome came
                those communities which had been&nbsp;invested with the full Roman franchise, such,
                for instance,&nbsp;as the old Latin towns of Aricia, Lanuvium,
                Tusculum,&nbsp;Nomentum, and Pedum. Lowest in the scale were those&nbsp;which had
                riot been considered ripe for the full franchise,&nbsp;but had, like Cære, received
                instead the “ civitas sine&nbsp;suffragio,” the civil without the political
                    rights.@@<sup>9</sup> Their&nbsp;members, though Roman citizens, were not
                enrolled in the&nbsp;tribes, and in time of war served not in the ranks of
                the&nbsp;Roman legions but in separate contingents. In addition&nbsp;to these
                organized town communities, there were also the&nbsp;groups of Roman settlers on the
                public lands, and the&nbsp;dwellers in the village communities of the
                enfranchised&nbsp;highland districts in central Italy.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The administrative needs of this enlarged Rome were obviously such as
                could not be adequately satisfied by the&nbsp;system which had done well enough fur
                a small city state&nbsp;with a few square miles of territory. The old centralization
                of all government in Rome itself had become an&nbsp;impossibility, and the Roman
                statesmen did their best to&nbsp;meet the altered requirements of the time. The
