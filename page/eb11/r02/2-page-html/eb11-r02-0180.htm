<p><span class="font2">Leto, because it was foretold that Leto’s son would kill the dragon. Leto escapes to Ortygia, which Poseidon covers with&nbsp;the sea in order to protect Leto. Here Apollo is bom, who&nbsp;four days later slays the dragon. Yet another explanation from&nbsp;Egyptian mythology is given by Bousset </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Offenbarung Johannis,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">2nd ed., pp. 354, 355) in the birth of the sun-god Horus.&nbsp;Here the goddess mother is represented with a sun upon her&nbsp;head. Typhon slays Horus. Hathor, his mother, is persecuted&nbsp;by Typhon and escapes to a floating island with the bones of&nbsp;Horus, who revives and slays the dragon.@@<sup>1</sup> There are obvious&nbsp;points of similarity, possibly of derivation, between the details&nbsp;in our text and the above myths, but the subject cannot&nbsp;be further pursued here, save that we remark that in the sun&nbsp;myth the dragon tries to kill the mother before the child’s birth,&nbsp;whereas in our text it is after his birth, and that neither in the&nbsp;Egyptian nor in the Greek myth is there any mention of the&nbsp;flight into the wilderness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The insertion of the alien matter 7-12 between 1-5 and 13-17 may be due to our author’s wish to show that the expulsion of&nbsp;Satan from heaven after Christ’s birth and ascension to heaven&nbsp;was owing in some measure to Christ, although he has allowed&nbsp;Michael’s name to remain in the borrowed passage, 7-12—a fact&nbsp;which shows how dependent the writer was on tradition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">xiii.—</span><span class="font2">In this chapter we have the two beasts@@<sup>2</sup> which symbolize respectively Rome and the Roman provincial priesthood of the&nbsp;imperial cult. Thus the world powers of heathen statesmanship&nbsp;and heathen religion are leagued in a confederacy against the&nbsp;rising Christian Church. Against these the church is not to&nbsp;attempt to use physical force; its only weapon is to be passive&nbsp;endurance and loyalty to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That this chapter must be interpreted by the contemporary-historical method is now generally admitted. Even Gunkel is obliged to abandon his favourite theory here, though he&nbsp;contests strongly the recognition of any allusion to Nero.&nbsp;Various solutions have been offered as to the seven emperors&nbsp;designed by the seven heads of the beast, xiii. 1. But thc&nbsp;details of this passage are not sufficiently definite to determine&nbsp;the question here. It will return in chapter xvii. There are,&nbsp;however, two facts pointing to a late date. The first is the&nbsp;advanced stage of development of this, the Neronic-Antichrist&nbsp;legend. One of the heads “ is smitten unto death,” but is healed&nbsp;of the death stroke. This points, we may here assume, to the&nbsp;Nero </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">redivivus</span><span class="font2"> legend, which could not have arisen for a full&nbsp;generation after Nero’s death, and the assumption receives&nbsp;large confirmation from the most probable Interjjretation of&nbsp;the enigmatical words, xiii. 18, “ the number of the beast . . .&nbsp;is six hundred and sixty six.” Four continental scholars,&nbsp;Fritzsche, Benary, Hitzig and Reuss, independently recognized&nbsp;that Nero was referred to under the mystical number 666.&nbsp;For by transliterating. Καισαρ Νβρώρ into Hebrew P&quot;<sup>13 Ί</sup>°Ρ&nbsp;and adding together the sums denoted by the Hebrew letters&nbsp;we obtain the number 666. This solution is confirmed by the&nbsp;fact<sup>4</sup>that it is possible to explain by it an ancient (Western?)&nbsp;variant for the number 666, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font2"> 616. This latter, which is&nbsp;attested by Irenaeus (v. 30. 1), the commentary of Ticonius,&nbsp;and the iincial C, can be explained from the Latin form of the&nbsp;name Nero, which by its omission of the final </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font2"> makes the sum&nbsp;total 616 instead of 666.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The above solution may be regarded as estabhshed, though several scholars, as Oscar Holtzmann (Stade’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Geschichte des&nbsp;Volkes Israel,</span><span class="font2"> ii. 661), Spitta and Erbes, have contended that&nbsp;616 was the original reading (Γάϊο$ Καΐσαρ=6ι6) and that</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>1</sup> On the possibility of other points of contact between the Apocalypse and Egyptian mythology, see Mrs Grenfell’s article,&nbsp;“ Egyptian Mythology and the Bible,” in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Monist</span><span class="font1"> (1906), pp.&nbsp;169-200.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>2</sup>In xiii. 2. the description of the beast unites the features of the four beasts in Daniel’s vision (vii.). It is clear that our author&nbsp;identified the fourth beast-, (vii. 23) with Rome, as did also the&nbsp;author of 4 Ezra xii. 10. But this was not the original significance&nbsp;of the fourth beast, for the author of Daniel referred thereby to the&nbsp;Greek empire; but, since the prophecy was not realized, it was&nbsp;subsequently reinterpreted, and applied, as we have observed, to&nbsp;Rome.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2">chapter xiii. was part of a Jewish apocalypse written under Caligula between the years 39 and 41. But this Cahgula&nbsp;hypothesis cannot be carried out unless by a vigorous use of&nbsp;the critical knife, in the course of which more than a third of&nbsp;the chapter is excised. Moreover the number 616 is too weakly&nbsp;supported to admit of its being recognized as the original.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The figure of the first beast presents many difficulties, owing to the fact that it is not freely invented but largely derived&nbsp;from traditional elements and is by the writer identified with&nbsp;the seventh wounded head. The second beast, signifying the&nbsp;pagan priesthood of the imperial cult, called “ the false&nbsp;prophet ” in xvi. 13, appears to be an independent development&nbsp;of the Antichrist legend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">xiv-xvi.—</span><span class="font2">These chapters contain a vision of Christ on Mount Zion and the 144,000 of the undefiled that follow Him, xiv. 1-5,&nbsp;the last warnings relating to the harvest and vintage of the&nbsp;world, xiv. 6-20: the vision of the wrath of God in the outpouring of the seven bowls containing the seven last plagues,&nbsp;xv.-xvi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the above section most critics are agreed that xiv. 14-20 originally represented the final judgment and was removed&nbsp;from its rightful place at the close of an apocalypse to its&nbsp;present position. In its original setting <sup>44</sup> the one like unto a&nbsp;Son of Man, having on his head a golden crown ” (xiv. 14),&nbsp;undoubtedly designated the Messiah, but the transformation&nbsp;of the final judgment into a preliminary act of judgment by a&nbsp;redactor, necessarily brought with it the degradation of the&nbsp;Son of Man to the level of a mere angel. Some critics hold&nbsp;that this apocalypse was the apocalyptic groundwork, but&nbsp;Bousset is of opinion that it stood originally in connexion with</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">xi. 1-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As regards xvi. the views of critics take different directions, but that of Bousset followed by Porter seems the most reasonable. This is that this chapter forms an introduction to xvii.,&nbsp;which was an independent fragment. The writer throws this&nbsp;introduction into his favourite scheme of seven acts, in this&nbsp;case symbolized by seven bowis. The earlier verses, 2-11, do&nbsp;not amount to much beyond a repetition of what is found in&nbsp;viii.-ix., save that as a preparation for xvii. references, are&nbsp;inserted to the beast and his worshippers (ver. 2) and to Rome&nbsp;(ver. 10). In xvi. 12-16 is a revised form of an older tradition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">xvii.—</span><span class="font2">This chapter presents great difficulties, especially if with the older and some of the recent exegetes we regard it as&nbsp;written at the same time and by the same author. Even so&nbsp;strong an upholder of the unity of the book as Swete is ready&nbsp;to admit that portions of xvii., as well as of xiii., show signs of&nbsp;an earlier date than the rest of the book. He writes: <sup>44</sup> The&nbsp;unity of the Book . . . cannot be pressed so far as to exclude&nbsp;the possibility that the extant book is a second edition of an&nbsp;earlief work, or that it incorporates earlier materials, and&nbsp;either hypothesis would sufficiently account for the few indications of a Neronic or Vespasianic date that have been found&nbsp;in it ” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Apoc. of St John<sup>2</sup>,</span><span class="font2"> p. civ.). This chapter cannot be&nbsp;interpreted apart from the Neronic myth. Of this there appear&nbsp;to be two stages attested here. Of the earlier we have traces&nbsp;in xvii. 16-17 and xvi. 12, where there are allusions to Nero’s&nbsp;confederacy with the Parthian kings with a view to the destruction of Rome. Of the later stage, when the myth of Nero&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">redivivus</span><span class="font2"> was fused with that of the Antichrist, we have attestation in xvii. 8, 12-14, where Nero is regarded as a demon&nbsp;coming up from the abyss to war not with Rome but with&nbsp;Christ and the elect. This development of the Neronic myth&nbsp;belongs to the last years of the ist century, and is decidedly&nbsp;against a Vespasianic date. To meet this difficulty a recent&nbsp;interpreter—Anderson Scott—though he assigns the book to&nbsp;the year </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font2"> 77, is yet willing to admit that the book though&nbsp;composed in the reign of Vespasian was <sup>44</sup> reissued with additions&nbsp;by the same hand after the death of Domitian” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Revelation,</span><span class="font2"> p. 56).&nbsp;Our author represents himself as writing under the sixth&nbsp;emperor. Five have already died, the seventh is yet to come,&nbsp;to be followed by yet an eighth, who is one of the seven </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Nero). In order to arrive at the date here implied, we can</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
