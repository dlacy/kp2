The ' following character of him is ſaid to be the production of Mr Burke :</p><p>- “ H is illneſs was long, but borne with a mild and cheerful fortitude, without the leaſt mixture of any thing irritable or querulous, agreeably to the placid and even tenor of his whole life. He had from the beginning of his malady a diſtinct view of his diffolu-tion, which he contemplated with that entire compo-ſure which nothing but the innocence, integrity, and uſefulncſa of his life, and an unaffected ſubmiffion to the will of Providence, could beſtow. In this ſituation he liad every conſolation from family tenderneſs, which his tenderneſs to his family had always merited.</p><p>" Sir Joſhua Reynolds was, on very many accounts, one of the moſt memorable men of his time : Pie was the ſirſt Engliſhman who added the praiſe of the ele-gant arts to the other glories of his country. In tafte, in grace, in facility, in happy invention, and in the richneſs and harmony of colouring, he was equal to the great matters of the renowned ages. In portrait he went beyond them ; for he communicated to that deſcription of the art in which Engliſh artiſts are the moſt engaged, a variety, a fancy, and a dignity, derived from the higher branches, which even thoſe who profeffed them in a ſuperior manner did not ai ways preſerve when they delineated individual nature. His portraits remind the ſpectator of tlie invention of hiſtory and the amenity of landfcape. In painting portraits, he appears not to be raiſed upon that platform, but to de-ſcend to it from a higher ſphere. His paintings illu-ſtrate his leſſons, and his leffons ſeem to be derived from his paintings.</p><p>“ He poffeffed the theory as perfectly as the practice of his art. To be ſuch a painter, he was a profound and penetrating philoſopher.</p><p>" In full happinefs of foreign and domeſtic ſame, admired by the expert in art, and by the learned in ſcience, courted by the great, careffed by ſovereign powers, and celebrated by diſtinguiſhed poets, bis native humility, modeſty, and candour, never forſook him, even on-ſurpriſe or provocation ; nor was the leaſt degree of arrogance or affumption viſible to the maſt ſcrutinizing eye in any part of his conduct or diſcourfe.</p><p>" His talents of every kind—powerful from nature, and not meanly cultivated in letters—his ſocial virtues in all the relations and all the habitudes of life, rendered him the centre of a very great and unparalleled variety of agreeable ſocieties, which will be diffipated by his death. He had too much merit not to excite ſome jea-louſy, too much innocence to provoke any enmity. The loſs of no man of his time can be felt with more ſincere, general, and unmixed ſorrow.”</p><p>REZAN, or Rezanskoi, an ancient town of Ruf-ſia, and capſtal of a duchy of the ſame name, with an archbiſhop’s ſee.
