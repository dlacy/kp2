<p><span class="font1">of the troops, offering to be reſponſible for the public peace, and to proceed in a body to Paris to encoun-ter perſonally every danger that might occur. But&nbsp;they were coolly told, that the king was the beſt judge&nbsp;of the mode of employing the troops, and that the pre-fence of the aſſembly was neceſſary at Verfailles. From&nbsp;a fovereign wh® doubtleſs recollected the proceedings&nbsp;of the long parliament of England, a different reply&nbsp;could not in reafon be expected. Οη receiving it,&nbsp;however, it was inſtantly decreed, on the motion of the&nbsp;marquis de la Fayette, that the late miniſtry had </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">carried with them</span><span class="font1"> the confidence of the aſſembly ; that the&nbsp;troops </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ought</span><span class="font1"> to be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">removed ;</span><span class="font1"> that the miniſtry are and&nbsp;ſhall be reſponſible to the people for their conduct ;&nbsp;that the aſſembly perſiſted in all its former decrees ; and&nbsp;that as it had taken the public debt under the protec-tion of the nation, no power in France was entitled to&nbsp;pronounce the infamous word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bankruptcy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The city of Paris was thrown into deep conſterna-tion by the news of M. Neckar’s retreat. His bull and that of the Duke dOrleans were dreſſed in mourning, and carried through the ſtreets. The royal Alle-mand, a German regiment, broke in pieces the buſts,&nbsp;and diſperſed the populace. The prince De Lambeſq,&nbsp;grand ecuyer of France, was ordered to advance with&nbsp;his regiment of cavalry, and take poſt at the Tlιuilleries.&nbsp;Being a man of a violent temper, and enraged by the&nbsp;appearances of diſapprobation which were viſible around&nbsp;him, he furiouſly cut down with his ſword a poor old&nbsp;man who was walking peaceably in the gardens. The&nbsp;conſequences of this act of inhumanity were ſuch as&nbsp;might have been expected ; a ſhout of execration instantly aroſe ; the cry </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">to arms</span><span class="font1"> was heard ; the military&nbsp;were aſſaulted on all ſides ; the French guards joined&nbsp;their countrymen, and compelled the Germans, over-powered by numbers, and unſupported by the reſt of&nbsp;the army, to retire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All order was now at an end, and as night approached an univerſal terror diſſuſed itſelf through the city. Bands of robbers were collecting ; and from them or&nbsp;from the foreign ſoldiery a general pillage was expected.&nbsp;The night paſſed away in conſternation and tumult. It&nbsp;was found in thc morning that the hoſpital of St Lazare was already plundered. The alarm bells were rung ;&nbsp;the citizens aſſembled at the Hotel de ville, and adopted a propoſal that was there made, of enrolling themſelves as a militia for general defence, under the appellation of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">national guard.</span><span class="font1"> This day and the ſucceed-ing night were ſpent in tolerable quietneſs, without any&nbsp;attempt on the part of the army. Οη the morning of&nbsp;the memorable 14th of July, it was diſcovered that the&nbsp;troops encamped in the Champs Eliſees had moved&nbsp;off, and an immediate aſſault was expected. The national guard now amounted to 150,000 men ; but they&nbsp;were in general deſtitute of arms. They had aſſumed&nbsp;a green cockade ; but on recollecting that this was the&nbsp;livery of the Count d’Artois, they adopted one of red,&nbsp;blue, and white. M. de la Salle was named commander&nbsp;in chief, officers were choſen, and detachments ſent&nbsp;around in queſt of arms. In the Hotel des Invalides&nbsp;upwards of 30,000 ſtand of arms were found, along&nbsp;with 20 pieces of cannon ; a variety of weapons was&nbsp;alfo procured from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">garde meuble de la couronne,</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;from the ſhops of armourers, cutlers, &amp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;»</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The celebrated fortreſs of the Baſtile was an object</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">of much jealouſy to the Pariſians. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">At 1</span><span class="font1">1 o'clock </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font1">the morning, M. de la Roſiere, at the head of a numerous deputation, waited upon M. de Launay the go-vernor, who promifed, ∙ along with the officers of his&nbsp;garrifon, that they would not ſire upon the city unleſs&nbsp;they ſhould be attacked. But a report was foon ſpread&nbsp;through Paris, that M. de Launay had, in a ſhort time&nbsp;thereafter, admitted into the fortreſs a multitude of&nbsp;perſons, and then treacherouſly maſſacred them. The&nbsp;cauſe of this piece of perfidy has never been explained.&nbsp;The fact itſelf has been denied ; but it was atteſted at&nbsp;the time by the duke of Dorſet, the Britiſh ambaſſa-dor at the court of France. The effect of the report&nbsp;was, that a ſudden refolution was adopted of aſſaulting&nbsp;the Baſtile ; an immenſe and furious multitude ruſhed&nbsp;into its outer, and ſoon forced their way into its inner,&nbsp;courts, where they received and returned a ſevere fire&nbsp;for the fpace of an hour. The French guards, who&nbsp;were now embodied into the national guard, conducted&nbsp;the attack with ſkill and coolneſs : they dragged three&nbsp;waggons loaded with ſtraw to the foot of the walls,&nbsp;and there ſet them on fire ; the ſmoke of thcſe broke&nbsp;the aim of the garrifon, while it gave no diſturbance&nbsp;to the more diſtant a(Γailants. The beſieging multitude preſſed the attack with incredible obſtinacy and&nbsp;vigour for the ſpace of four hours ; the garrifon was&nbsp;in confuſion ; the officers ſerved the cannon in perfon, and fired their muſkets in the ranks ; the governor,&nbsp;in deſpair, thrice attempted to blow up the fortrefs.&nbsp;A capitulation, when at laſt fought, was refuſed to the&nbsp;garrifon, and an unconditional ſurrender took place.&nbsp;The governor, and M. de Loſme Salbrai his major, a&nbsp;gentleman of diſtinguiſhed humanity and honour, be-came victims of popular fury in ſpite of every effort&nbsp;that could be made for their protection ; but the French&nbsp;guards ſucceeded in procuring the ſafety of the garrifon. only feven priſoners were found in the Baſtile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A guard was placed in it, and the keys were ſent to the celebrated M. Briffot de warville, who a few years&nbsp;before had inhabited one of its caverns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The remaining part of this eventful day was fpent at Paris in a mixture of triumph and alarm. In the&nbsp;pocket of the governor of the Baſtile a letter was found,&nbsp;encouraging him to reſiſtance by the promiſe of ſpeedy&nbsp;ſuccours, written by M. de Fleffelles, the prevot de&nbsp;marchands, or chief city magiſtrate, who had pretended to be a moſt zealous patriot. This piece of trea-chery was puniſhed by inſtant death ; and his bloody&nbsp;head was carried through the city on a pole, along with,&nbsp;that of M. de Launay. At the approach of night </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">body of troops advanced towards the city, at the Bar-riere d<sup>,</sup>Enfer. The new national guard hurried thither, preceded by a train of artillery, and the troops&nbsp;withdrew upon the firſt fire : barricadoes were everywhere formed, the alarm-bells were rung, and a general illumination continued during the whole of this night&nbsp;of confuſion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the mean time, it was obvious that the new mini-ſtry were entering upon a difficult ſcene of action, where one falſe ſtep might lead to ruin, and where&nbsp;their own plan of conduct ought to be maturely digeſt-ed. Marſhall Broglio was made miniſter of war, the&nbsp;baron de Breteuil preſident of finance, M. de la Gale-ziere comptroller-general, M. de la Porte intendant of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the war department, and </span><span class="font1">M.
