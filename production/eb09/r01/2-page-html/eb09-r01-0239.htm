<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">oosphères of the Saprolegnieæ. In this case that differentiation of the protoplasm of the oogonium into ooplasm and periplasm which has been described above as occurring&nbsp;in the closely allied and completely sexual Peronosporeæ&nbsp;does not take place, but the whole is used in the formation&nbsp;of the oosphères. It is quite clear also that in the Saprolegnieæ no sexual process takes place. In some species of&nbsp;Saprolegnia the antheridia are altogether absent, in others&nbsp;they are rudimentary, and even in those Saprolegnieæ&nbsp;(some species of Saprolegnia, Achlya, Aphanomyces) in&nbsp;which the antheridia are well-developed they remained&nbsp;closed. No case is known of male parthenogenesis, that&nbsp;is, of the development of an individual from a male reproductive cell, among plants in which the sexual differentiation of the reproductive cells is well-marked, but there are&nbsp;instances of the kind in more lowly organized plants.&nbsp;Thus in the Mucorini, mentioned above, one of the azygo-spores produced may be regarded as belonging to a male&nbsp;organ ; again, in Ectocarpus the male planogamete germinates independently as well as the female. Among plants&nbsp;the sexual organs of which do not produce specialized reproductive cells instances of parthenogenesis also occur.&nbsp;Thus the spores (ascospores) which are produced by the&nbsp;female organ (ascogonium) of those Ascomycetes, such as&nbsp;the Erysipheæ, Pénicillium, Melanospora, Xylaria, in which&nbsp;the male organ is functionless or absent can only be regarded&nbsp;as being parthenogenetically produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Admitting, then, that sexual differ from asexual reproductive cells in the lack of something which the&nbsp;latter possess, and which was thrown off either from the&nbsp;former or from the organs which produce them, we may&nbsp;go on to inquire what this something may be. Our information on this point is very scanty, but Strasburger’s&nbsp;views throw some light upon it. He considers, namely,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• that the formative processes of the cell are regulated by the hyaline plasma of the nucleus—the nucleo-idioplasma,&nbsp;as he terms it ; the richer the nucleus is in this substance&nbsp;the more capable is the cell of producing new cells. The&nbsp;asexual reproductive cells are then cells the nuclei of which&nbsp;are especially rich in this substance. He considers that&nbsp;the differences between asexual and sexual reproductive&nbsp;cells is quantitative and not qualitative—that the nuclei of&nbsp;the former are rich in nucleo-idioplasma, those of the latter&nbsp;poor, either originally or by the throwing off of part of&nbsp;their substance in the mode described above. In endeavouring to account for the further differentiation of&nbsp;sexual reproductive cells into male and female, it seems&nbsp;natural to suggest that the respective nuclei have undergone a qualitative differentiation, and that in the sexual&nbsp;process the qualitative, as w׳ell as the quantitative,&nbsp;incompleteness of each is made good. Strasburger is,&nbsp;however, strongly of opinion that this is not so, but that&nbsp;the difference is purely quantitative. But it must be&nbsp;pointed out that, according to this view, there is no&nbsp;reason why a sexual process should not take place, either&nbsp;between two male cells or organs, or between two female&nbsp;cells or organs, a possibility which is never realized, nor is&nbsp;it possible to account for the fact to be subsequently discussed that in many cases a sexual process cannot take place&nbsp;between sexual cells or organs of a closely-allied origin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The nature of the sexual process will be better understood by a detailed description of it in some particular case. The following is a brief account of the results of&nbsp;Strasburger’s observations on the process of fertilization in&nbsp;Angiosperms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">At the period of the dehiscence of the anther, the protoplasm of the pollen-grain undergoes division into two cells—a smaller, the&nbsp;&gt;- generative cell, and a larger, the vegetative cell. At the time of&nbsp;pollination, when the pollen-grain is mature, it is usually the&nbsp;case that the only persisting indication of the previous cell-division&nbsp;is the presence of two nuclei in the protoplasm. In many cases</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">the two nuclei were found to differ qualitatively, inasmuch as the generative nucleus stained readily when treated with carmine,&nbsp;picro-carmine, methyl-green, &amp;c., whereas the vegetative nucleus&nbsp;stained imperfectly or not at all. On the formation of the pollen-tube, the generative nucleus, and sometimes the vegetative nucleus&nbsp;also, is carried down into it, and the former then undergoes division&nbsp;into two ; occasionally one of the new nuclei divides again. The&nbsp;pollen-tube grows down the style, enters the ovary, and is directed&nbsp;to the micropyle of an ovule. In the ovule the egg-apparatus lies&nbsp;at the micropylar end of the embryo-sac, and the delicate wall of&nbsp;the embryo-sac covering it undergoes absorption. In its further&nbsp;growth the pollen-tube comes into contact with the synergic!* ; in&nbsp;some cases its growth now stops, and a portion of its protoplasm,&nbsp;with one or both of the generative nuclei, passes through the&nbsp;mucilaginous wall at the apex of the tube, without leaving any&nbsp;opening behind it, and travels to the oosphere ; in other cases the&nbsp;pollen-tube grows between the synergidie to the oosphere, and at&nbsp;once pours a portion of its protoplasm with a generative nucleus&nbsp;into it. This is followed by the appearance of a second nucleus in&nbsp;the oosphere (the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">male pronucleus),</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> which is the generative nucleus&nbsp;derived from the pollen-tube, which now travels towards the&nbsp;nucleus of the oosphere </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">{female pronucleus)</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and fuses with it; wheu&nbsp;the two pronuclei have each a nucleolus these also eventually fuse.&nbsp;Fertilization is now complete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The synergidie take no direct share in the process of fertilization, but become disorganized; their disorganization usually begins&nbsp;when the pollen-tube first comes into contact with them. They&nbsp;serve merely to direct the pollen-tube or its escaped contents to the&nbsp;oosphere and to provide nourishment for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The fusion of the male and female pronuclei has been observed also in the oosphere of the Gymnosperms, and in the conjugation&nbsp;of Spirogyra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Since plants are so commonly able to reproduce vege-tatively, the question arises as to the necessity of the production, either sexually or asexually, of spores. The&nbsp;biological importance of these cells is very great. They are&nbsp;capable, namely, of retaining their vitality under external&nbsp;conditions, such as long drought, absence of food, extremes&nbsp;of heat and cold, which would prove fatal to the plant,&nbsp;and they therefore are essential to the maintenance of the&nbsp;species. Further they are of importance in the distribution&nbsp;of the species; they are light, readily transportable by&nbsp;wind or water, in some cases themselves actively motile.&nbsp;In this way they serve to prevent that close aggregation of&nbsp;individuals of the same species which would result from a&nbsp;continued vegetative multiplication, and would prove injurious to the species. In the case of Phanerogams, in&nbsp;which the macrospore is not set free from its sporangium,&nbsp;the same ends are obtained by the production of seeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The further question now arises as to the importance of the sexual process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">It appears that, if any given species, at least among the higher plants, is reproduced through a long series of&nbsp;generations in a non-sexual manner, the individuals tend&nbsp;to degenerate, and the original well-developed form can&nbsp;only be reattained by the formation of a sexually produced&nbsp;spore. This result is to some extent realized by the fusion&nbsp;of two sexual cells or organs belonging to the same individual—that is, by self-fertilization—but more completely&nbsp;when the fusion takes place between sexual cells or organs&nbsp;belonging to distinct individuals—that is, by cross-fertilization. In some plants, as in the Peronosporem and in those&nbsp;sexual Ascomycetes which have pollinodial antheridia, self-fertilization alone is possible ; this is also the case in certain&nbsp;Phanerogams in which the arrangements are such (notably&nbsp;in cleistogamous flowers) that only pollen from its own&nbsp;anthers can reach the stigma of the flower. In most cases,&nbsp;however, the conditions under which the sexual process is&nbsp;carried on, such as the formation of free-swimming gametes&nbsp;and antherozoids, and of spermatia and pollen-grains which&nbsp;can be readily conveyed from place to place, are such as to&nbsp;favour the occurrence of cross-fertilization. In some there&nbsp;are special arrangements for the attainment of this end,&nbsp;the most general of which is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dioecism,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> that is, the production of the male and female organs by distinct organisms.&nbsp;Thus in certain Fucaceae (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fucus vesicidosus, F. nodosus</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
