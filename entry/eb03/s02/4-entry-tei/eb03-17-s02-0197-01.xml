a puncheon, piece of metal, or other matter, uſually either round or oval; whereon are engraven the arms, device, &amp;c. of ſome prince, ſtate, community, magiſtrate, or private perſon, often with a legend or inſcription; the impreſſion whereof in wax ſerves to make acts, inſtruments, &amp;c. authentic.</p><p>The uſe of ſeals, as a mark of authenticity to letters and other inſtruments in writing, is extremely ancient, We read of it among the Jews and Perſians in the earlieſt and moſt ſacred records of hiſtory. And in the book of Jeremiah there is a very remarkable inſtances not only of an atteſtation by ſeal, but alſo of the other uſual formalities attending a Jewiſh purchaſe. In the civil law alſo, ſeals were the evidence of truth, and were required, on the part of the witneſſes at leaſt, at the atteſtation of every teſtament; But in the times of our Saxon anceſtors, they were not much in uſe in England. For though Sir Edward Coke relies on an<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0204.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0198"/>
inſtance of king Edwyn’s making uſe of a ſeal about 100 years before the conqueſt, yet it does not follow that this was the uſage among the whole nation: and perhaps the charter he mentions may be of doubtful authority, from this very circumſtance of its being ſealed; ſince we are aſſured by all our ancient hiſtorians that ſealing was not then in common uſe. The method of the Saxons was, for ſuch as could write to ſubſcribe their names, and, whether they could write or not, to affix the ſign of the croſs; which cuſtom our illiterate vulgar do for the moſt part to this day keep up, by ſigning a croſs for their mark when unable to write their names. And indced this inability to write, and therefore making a croſs in its ſtead, is honeſtly avowed by Caedwalla, a Saxon king, at the end of one of his charters. In like manner, and for the ſame unſurmountable reaſon, the Normans, a brave but illiterate nation, at their firſt ſettlement in France uſed the practice of ſealing only, without writing their names; which cuſtom continued when learning made its way among them, though the reaſon for doing it had ceaſed; and hence the charter of Edward the Confeſſor to Weſtminſter- abbey, himſelf being brought up in Normandy, was witneſſed only by his ſeal, and is generally thought to be the oldeſt ſealed charter of any authenticity in England. At the Conqueſt, the Norman lords brought over into this kingdom their own faſhions; and introduced waxen ſeals only, inſtead of the Engliſh method of writing their names, and ſigning with the ſign of the croſs. The impreſſions of theſe ſeals were ſometimes a knight on horſeback, ſometimes other devices; but coats of arms were not introduced into ſeals, nor indeed uſed at all till about the reign of Richard I. who brought them from the croiſade in the Holy Land, where they were firſt invented and painted on the ſhields of the knights, to diſtinguiſh the variety of perſons of every Chriſtian nation who reſorted thither, and who could not, when clad in complete ſteel, be otherwiſe known or aſcertained.</p><p>This neglect of ſigning, and reſting only upon the authenticity of ſeals, remained very long among us; for it was held in all our books, that ſealing alone was ſufficient to authenticate a deed: and ſo the common form of atteſting deeds, “ſealed and delivered,” continues to</p><p>this day; notwithſtanding the ſtatute 29 Car. II, c. 3. revives the Saxon cuſtom, and expreſsly directs the ſigning in all grants of lands and many other ſpecies of deeds: in which, therefore, ſigning ſeems to be now as neceſſary as ſealing, though it hath been ſometimes held that the one includes the other.</p><p>The king’s <hi rend="italic">great ſeal</hi> is that whereby all patents, commiſſions, warrants, &amp;c. coming down from the king are ſealed; the keeping whereof is in the hands of the lord chancellor.
