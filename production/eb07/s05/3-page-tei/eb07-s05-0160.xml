Instant relief invariably follows the securing a state of perfect rest ; other means, local and constitutional, are thus afforded a fair chance of doing good, and the natural efforts towards a cure are no longer thwarted and interrupted. But, above all, the effect on the general health is most remarkable and cheering. Even in very complicated and bad cases, in which sinuses communicate with the cavity of the joint, and the heads of the bones are ascertained to be in a state of ulceration, or partially necrosed, the good effects of perfect quietude of the joint will soon be manifested by cessation of pain, diminution of discharge, and speedy improvement of the general health. A cure of the local mischief may not be possible by this means alone, but much will often be gained, as regards the success of ulterior proceedings, by the rapid and certain amendment of the patient’s condition.” This salutary rest is the first part of the treatment of all diseased joints, and is ∞ntinued, in general, throughout the whole period of cure ; it is obtained by the application of splints, varied in form and construction according to the particular joint affected.</p><p>Disease of the soft parts of the joint usually commences in an inflammatory form, requiring depletion ; when acute, the antiphlogistic treatment, local and general, must be very active, so as at once to arrest the morbid action ; and hot fomentation and poultice will generally be found more soothing than cold applications. When the more violent symptoms have subsided, the disease giving way, a determination to the surface, with discharge, lends powerful aid towards its final extinction. For this purpose vesication may be produced,by cantharides or by nitrate of silver; or an eruption may be established by friction with a liniment of croton oil, or an ointment of tartrite of antimony, their strength proportioned to the nature of the part, and age of the patient. In chronic swelling of a joint, whether the effect of inflammatory action, or slowly and gradually supervening after injury, the diseased action must not only be arrested, but absorption also procured of the deposit and effusion within the synovial capsule and bursæ. To obtain the former indication, local depletion and counter-irritation are employed, according as the circumstances of the case require; and to obtain the latter, uniform pressure of the whole swelling, and gentle irritation of the surface, are combined with the means of securing the all-important rest of the joint, according to the method first recommended by Mr Scott. The limb having been uniformly supported by a roller, from its extremity up to the diseased articulation, the surface of the swelling is covered by lint spread with some gently stimulating ointment,—soap cerate with camphor, for example, or that with a greater or less proportion of the unguentum hydrargyri ; and the whole articulation is then surrounded by long strips of adhesive plaster, drawn with moderate and uniform tightness, so as to support and gently compress the parts, without producing absolute pain or uneasiness. Above all, splints are applied to secure total immunity from motion ; and they may either be of leather or wood, as most suitable to the joint affected. When this dressing has become loose, from subsidence of the swelling, it is re-applied as often as may be necessary. Should fresh excitement occur in the joint, from any accidental cause, during this treatment, the apparatus must be discontinued, until such excitement has been subdued by the usual means already described ; and when the pressure is resumed, it should at first be very moderate. During the treatment the limb must be kept or gradually brought into the most advantageous position for ultimate use, particularly if, from the duration, nature, and extent of the disease, there is reason to expect impairment of the joint’s motion. Thus, by steady extension with splints, the knee-joint may be brought into nearly a straight position, so that it shall be serviceable in progression ; and the elbow may be bent, to form a right angle</p><p>with the humerus, so as to be convenient for prehension. But such alterations of stiffened limbs must be proceeded with very cautiously, otherwise they may occasion undue excitement, and consequent renewal of disease in the joint.</p><p>The preceding treatment will be found applicable to almost all joints, the hip not excepted. In morbus coxarius, for example, it is useful for securing immobility of the articulation, an object of such paramount importance towards arresting the progress of that formidable disease ; and in its advanced stages it is productive of at least relief. The joint is placed extended, that being the preferable position, in case of anchylosis, and surrounded by “ soft lint soaked in a strong solution of gum acacia, which is laid on in strips over the side and pelvis, from the short ribs to the knee, and made to embrace the limb fully. A layer of dry lint is first applied, and then two or three others, soaked in the mucilage, follow : these are covered by a fold or two of coarse calico, and the whole is retained by a roller.” Sometimes it is necessary to preserve the limb steadily in position by a wooden splint, as in fracture, until the composition has dried, and the splint, so formed, adapted itself closely to the parts. “ This gum-splint can be made of any form, so as to allow of its being taken off, trimmed, lined with wash leather, or protected with a layer of oiled silk, and re-applied with a clean bandage. It can also be fashioned so as to leave any part exposed : the discharge from issues and abscesses can thus be allowed to escape, and the parts can be dressed, and otherwise attended to, without disturbing the limb. In fact, the apparatus can be varied as circumstances demand, and is applicable in a great variety of cases, and to any articulation.” A similarly useful splint is made “ of leather dressed without oil, cut to a pro- per form, moistened in hot water, and applied with a roller. It soon becomes firm, and forms a case which fits the part accurately; it is then pared, fashioned neatly, and lined. In many chronic cases such splints answer admirably ; but the gum-splints can be applied with less disturbance of the limb, which in many instances is a great recommendation.”</p><p>“ In the painful and dangerous affections of the articulations, when the cartilages are extensively absorbed, and when the cancellated texture of the bone is more or less diseased, good effects may yet follow judicious treatment. Besides following out the principle of preventing all motion, great relief will often be experienced from establishing a permanent discharge from the neighbourhood of the diseased tissues. This can be done simply and effectually, without causing alarm, or exciting much pain, by confining a small piece of caustic potash on the skin near the diseased joint. The sore thus formed is deepened, and made to discharge freely, when disposed to heal, by a few hours’ application of the antimonial ointment. <hi rend="italic">A</hi> seton may be preferred in some situations : certainly discharge can be thus kept up, and derivation obtained from the affected parts, fully as well as by actual cauteries, moxas, pea-issues, or other farrier-like practices. Great care must be taken in the placing of issues ; they should be near to, but not upon ajoint. Serious results have sometimes followed their careless application ; diseased action has been increased, they having reached, or even penetrated, the synovial capsule.’’</p><p>By the careful and judicious employment of such treatment, many affections of joints which resisted the less simple modes of cure formerly in use, are now successfully combated ; and many limbs are saved which our forefathers would not even have attempted to cure. But still there are too many cases which baffle all efforts to arrest the progress of morbid action ; and it becomes necessary, in order to relieve the labouring constitution, and preserve life, to remove either the diseased parts alone, or the remainder of the limb along with them by amputation. The former operation is termed resection, and is the preferable, because the less mutilating and severe, when the case is such as to</p></body></text></TEI>
