A vegetable principle known as “saponin,” and chemically analogous to the arabin of soluble gums and to mucilage, forms with water a lather, and is on that account available as a substitute for soap. Saponin is obtainable from soap nuts, the fruit of a tree, <hi rend="italic">Saponaria officinalis</hi> and allied species; but its most important source is the Quillai bark of Chili yielded by a large tree, <hi rend="italic">Quillaja saponaria.</hi> The inner bark of the tree, reduced to powder, is employed in Chili as a substitute for soap.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
