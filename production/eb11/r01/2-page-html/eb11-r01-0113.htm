<p><span class="font1">RAM MOHAN ROY (1774-1833), Indian religious reformer, and founder of the Brahma Sa1naj (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q. υ. )</span><span class="font1"> or Theistic Church,&nbsp;was born at Radhanagar, in the district of Hugli, Bengal, in&nbsp;May 1774. He was the son of a small landowner, and in his&nbsp;early life acquired a knowledge of Persian, Arabic and Sanskrit,&nbsp;besides his own vernacular, Bengali. At the age of sixteen he&nbsp;first assailed idolatry in his Bengali work, entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Idolatrous&nbsp;Religious System of the Hindus.</span><span class="font1"> This gave offence to his orthodox father, and Ram Mohan left home and spent some years&nbsp;in travel. At the age of twenty-two he began his study of the&nbsp;English language, and he also acquired a knowledge of other&nbsp;modern and ancient European languages. On the death of his&nbsp;father he obtained an appointment under the British goverment in 1800, from which he retired in 1814, settled down in&nbsp;Calcutta, and devoted himself to religious reform. He had&nbsp;already inaugurated a circle for discussing the absurdities of&nbsp;idol worship, and published a striking book in Persian called&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tuhfat-al-Muwahhiddin</span><span class="font1"> (“ A Gift to Monotheists On his&nbsp;settlement in Calcutta he established a little friendly society&nbsp;(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Atmiya Sabha),</span><span class="font1"> which met weekly to read the Hindu scriptures&nbsp;and to chant monotheistic hymns. In 1820 he issued a selection&nbsp;from the Christian Gospels entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Precepts of Jesus the&nbsp;Guide to Peace and Happiness.</span><span class="font1"> He also wrote Bengali works&nbsp;on the Vedanta philosophy, translated some of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Upanishads,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">entered into controversies with Christian missionaries, and on&nbsp;the 23rd of January 1830 definitely established the Brahma&nbsp;Samaj “ for the worship and adoration of the Eternal, Unsearchable, Immutable Being who is the Author and Preserver&nbsp;of the Universe. ” He gave his support to the governor-general,&nbsp;Lord William Bentinck, for the abolition of the suttee rite, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the custom of permitting Hindu widows to burn themselves on&nbsp;the funeral pyre of their husbands. He also worked hard to&nbsp;spread education among his fellow-countrymen, and to improve&nbsp;the quality and the prestige of the native press. In 1830 the&nbsp;emperor of Delhi bestowed on Ram Mohan the title of raja, and&nbsp;sent him to England as his agent. Raja Ram Mohan Roy gave&nbsp;his evidence before the Select Committee of the House of&nbsp;Commons on the judicial and revenue systems of India. He&nbsp;presented petitions to the House of Commons in support of the&nbsp;abolition of the suttee rite, and had the satisfaction of being&nbsp;present in the House when the appeal against such abolition&nbsp;was rejected on the 11th of July 1832. As the first educated and&nbsp;eminent Indian who had come to England, he received a cordial&nbsp;welcome from learned men; and Bentham addressed him as an&nbsp;“ intensely admired and dearly beloved collaborator in the&nbsp;service of mankind. ” Ram Mohan also visited France and&nbsp;contemplated a voyage to America, but a sudden attack of&nbsp;brain fever led to his death on the 27th of September 1833. He&nbsp;was buried at Bristol, where a tomb was erected by his friend&nbsp;Dwarka Nath Tagore.</span></p>

(1901) 14, 546.&nbsp;It is the residence of a raja of old family, head of the Maravar&nbsp;caste, whose title is setupathi, or lord of Adam’s Bridge. The&nbsp;estate covers an area of 2104 sq. m., and pays a permanent&nbsp;land revenue of £25, 000. It is a desolate and generally unfertile&nbsp;tract, traversed by the South Indian railway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RÂMNICU SARAT </span><span class="font0">(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rîmnicu Sărat),</span><span class="font1"> the capital of the department of Râmnicu Sarat, Rumania; on the railway from&nbsp;Buzeu to Focshani, and on the left bank of the Râmnicu, a&nbsp;tributary of the Sereth. Pop. (1900) 13,134, about 1500&nbsp;being Jews. The town rises from a marshy plain, east of the&nbsp;Carpathians, and west of the cornlands of southern Moldavia.&nbsp;Salt and petroleum are worked in the mountains, and there&nbsp;is a considerable trade in agricultural produce and preserved&nbsp;meat. Râmnicu Sarat was the scene of battles between the&nbsp;Moldavians and the Walachians in 1434 and 1573, and between&nbsp;the Walachians and Turks in 1634. Here also, in 1789, an&nbsp;Austro-Russian army defeated the Turks. In 1854 the town was&nbsp;almost destroyed by fire and was rebuilt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RÂMNICUVÂLCEA(</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rímnicu</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vâlcea),</span><span class="font1"> or Rymnik, an episcopal city and the capital of the department of Vâlcea, Rumania; situated at the foot of the Carpathians, on the right bank of&nbsp;the river Olt, and on the railway from Caracal to Hermann-stadt in Transylvania.

Besides wine,&nbsp;fruit, grain and timber, the surrounding uplands yield&nbsp;petroleum and salt. Within a few miles are the thermal&nbsp;springs of Olanestzi and the salt mines of Ocnele Mari. The&nbsp;city is said to be the ancient Castra Traiana, and many traces&nbsp;of old encampments bear evidence of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RAMPOLLA, COUNT MARIANO DEL TINDARO (1843- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;),</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Italian cardinal, was born on the 17th of August 1843, at Polizzi, in the Sicilian diocese of Cefalù. Having completed&nbsp;his studies in the Capranica College at Rome, and having&nbsp;taken holy orders, he studied diplomacy at the College of&nbsp;Ecclesiastical Nobles, and in 1875 was appointed councillor&nbsp;to the papal nunciature at Madrid. Two years later he was&nbsp;recalled to Rome and appointed secretary of the Propaganda&nbsp;for Eastern Affairs, and for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical&nbsp;Affairs. Consecrated titular archbishop of Heraclea in 1885,&nbsp;he returned to Madrid as nuncio, but was shortly afterwards&nbsp;created cardinal and appointed to the papal secretaryship of&nbsp;state. New to the Sacred College and free from traditional&nbsp;preconceptions, he was admirably fitted to carry out the papal&nbsp;policy under Leo XIII. (see Papacy). Rightly or wrongly, he&nbsp;was held personally responsible for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rapprochement</span><span class="font1"> with&nbsp;France and Russia and the opposition to the Powers of the&nbsp;Triple Alliance; and this attitude had its effect on his career&nbsp;when Leo XIII. died. Rampolla was undoubtedly the&nbsp;favourite among the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">papabili</span><span class="font1"> cardinals; but the veto of Austria&nbsp;was interposed (see Conclave), and the votes of the Sacred&nbsp;College fell to Cardinal Sarto, who on the 4th of August 1903&nbsp;became pope as Pius X. Cardinal Rampolla at once resigned&nbsp;his office as secretary of state, being succeeded by Cardinal&nbsp;Merry del Val, and ceased to play any conspicuous part in&nbsp;the Curia.</span></p>

The&nbsp;country is level and generally fertile; being watered in the&nbsp;north by the rivers Kosila and Nahul, and in the south by the&nbsp;Ramganga.

When the Rohillas were subjugated by&nbsp;the nawab of Oudh, with the assistance of a force lent by&nbsp;Warren Hastings, one of their number, Faiz-uflah Khan, from&nbsp;whom the present nawab traces his descent, was permitted&nbsp;to retain possession of Rampur. During the Mutiny of 1857&nbsp;the nawab of Rampur rendered important services to the&nbsp;British, for which he received a grant of land ‘assessed at £9000&nbsp;in perpetuity, besides other honours. The state is crossed&nbsp;by the main line of the Oudh &amp; Rohilkhand railway from&nbsp;Bareilly to Moradabad. The town of Rampur is on the left&nbsp;bank of the river Kosila, 620 ft. above the sea, with a railway&nbsp;station 39 m. N. W. of Bareilly, Pop. (1901) 78,758.
