It is connected by rail with Rostoff-on-the-Don. Although founded only in 1776 for military purposes, it has rapidly grown, and has now a population of 35,500, while it is one of the best built provincial towns of the Russian empire. It has wide streets, and its houses are mostly of stone ; large gardens surround the houses; and numerous farms and gardens occupy the territory (nearly 50,000 acres) belonging to the town. It is well provided with educational institutions, there being four gymnasia for boys and girls and several primary schools. Nearly all the manufactures of the province are concentrated in Stavropol. The trade is considerable, large numbers of cattle (more than 35,000 head annually) being sent to Moscow and St Petersburg, while tallow and more than 15,000 sheepskins are exported <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Rostoff to Russia. Corn is also exported to the value of nearly £300,000, while manufactured wares are imported to the value of nearly £150,000.
