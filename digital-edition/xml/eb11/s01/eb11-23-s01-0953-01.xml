                <p><label>S</label>, the twenty-first letter of the Phoenician alphabet, is one of
                    the four sibilants which that alphabet possesses. In the Phoenician alphabet it
                    takes a form closely resembling the English W, and this when moved through an
                    angle of 90˚ is the ordinary Greek <hi rend="italic">sigma</hi> Σ. In Phoenician
                    itself and in the other Semitic alphabets the position of the middle legs of the
                    W is altered so that the symbol takes such forms as ■ or ■or ■,ultimately ending
                    sometimes in a form like K laid sideways,■. In Greek, where Σ is the twentieth
                    letter of the alphabet, or, if the merely numerical ■ and ■ are excluded, the
                    eighteenth, another form ■ or ■ according to the direction of the writing is
                    also widespread. This, which is the only form of the earliest period at Cumae,
                    where it is also found more rounded ■ , is</p>
                <p>the origin of the Latin S and its descendants. The development from the angular
                    to the curved shape of S may be seen in its occurrences on the early cippus
                    found in the Roman Forum in 1899. Apart from doubtful instances it is there six
                    times dearly engraved; four of the instances are angular, the other two are more
                    or less rounded. The Semitic name of the symbol is <hi rend="italic">shin;</hi>
                    the Greek name <hi rend="italic">sigma</hi> may mean merely the hissing letter
                    and may be a genuine Greek derivative from the verb ■, hiss. Some, however, see
                    in it a corruption of the Semitic name <hi rend="italic">samekh,</hi> the letter
                    which corresponds in alphabetic position and in shape to the Greek ξ (x). The
                    Dorian Greeks, however, as Herodotus tells us (i. 139), called that letter <hi
                        rend="italic">san</hi> which the Ionian Greeks called <hi rend="italic"
                        >sigma; san</hi> seems more likely to be an attempt to reproduce the Semitic
                    name. Herodotus says nothing of a difference in shape, but most authorities
                    regard the form M, which with the value of <hi rend="italic">s</hi> is
                    practically confined to Doric areas, as being <hi rend="italic">san.</hi> In the
                    compound <hi rend="italic">σαμφopαs, san</hi> like koppa (κoππατiαs) was known
                    to the Athenians as a brand for highbred horses (cf. Aristophanes, <hi
                        rend="italic">Clouds,</hi> 122, 1298, 23, 438). For the symbol T which was
                    used at Ephesus and other places in Asia Minor and elsewhere for the sound
                    represented by -σσ- in Ionic Greek, by -ττ- in Attic, see Alphabet. Further
                    points of diffi-culty in connexion with the sibilants are discussed under X and
                    Z. The pronunciation of <hi rend="italic">s</hi> was originally unvoiced: in
                    English it is often used for the voiced sound as well, compare <hi rend="italic"
                        >lose</hi> with <hi rend="italic">loose, house</hi> with <hi rend="italic"
                        >houses.</hi> At the end of words the voiced sound is often written with -5,
                    the unvoiced with - <hi rend="italic">ss</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">his</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">hiss.</hi> In other cases the pronunciation can be
                    ascertained only from the context, as in <hi rend="italic">use,</hi> unvoiced
                    for the substantive, voiced for the verb. Sometimes a difference of meaning is
                    indicated by difference of spelling though the sounds in the two words are
                    identical, as in <hi rend="italic">furs</hi> and <hi rend="italic">furze.</hi>
                    The voiced form of <hi rend="italic">s</hi> (i.e. <hi rend="italic">z)</hi>
                    readily passes into <hi rend="italic">r</hi> in many languages: compare the Eng.
                        <hi rend="italic">hare</hi> with the Ger. <hi rend="italic">Hase,</hi> the
                    Eng. <hi rend="italic">ear</hi> and Lat. <hi rend="italic">auris</hi> with the
                    Gothic <hi rend="italic">auso</hi> and Lithuanian <hi rend="italic">ausìs,
                        "</hi> ear." Here also should be mentioned the sound <hi rend="italic"
                        >sh,</hi> which, like <hi rend="italic">th,</hi> is not a combination of
                    sounds though written with two symbols. Hence in transcription from foreign
                    languages and in works on phonetics it is represented by ■ or ■. The difference
                    in formation between ■ and ■ is that the former is dental or alveolar, the
                    latter is produced farther back and has at least two varieties. In the usual
                    Eng. <hi rend="italic">sh</hi> the tip of the tongue is bent backwards so that
                    the tongue becomes spoon-shaped. The voiced sound to this is generally written
                        <hi rend="italic">z</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">azure,</hi> but sometimes
                        <hi rend="italic">s</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">pleasure.</hi> The sound of
                        <hi rend="italic">sh</hi> is also sometimes represented bý <hi rend="italic"
                        >s,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">sure, sugar.</hi> This is occasioned by the
                    y-sound with which <hi rend="italic">u</hi> now begins, and is carried further
                    in dialect than in the literary language, <hi rend="italic">sue</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">suit,</hi> for example, being pronounced in Scotland like the
                    Eng. <hi rend="italic">shoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">shoot.</hi> The <hi
                        rend="italic">sh</hi> sound is sometimes not even written with a sibilant,
                    as in the pronunciation of the <hi rend="italic">ci</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >ti</hi> of words like <hi rend="italic">rhetorician</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">nation.</hi> (P. Gι.)</p>
