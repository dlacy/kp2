<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sense Organs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tegumentary Organs of some Tactileor other Sense.—</span><span class="font0">Reptiles&nbsp;possess apparently no traces of those tegumentary sense organs&nbsp;which, belonging to the domains of thc trigeminal and vagus&nbsp;nerves, have spread far over the body in fishes and batrachia.&nbsp;They were developed by those classes in correlation with their&nbsp;essentially aquatic life. This does not apply to the reptiles&nbsp;which, as a class, are of absolutely terrestrial origin. Nevertheless all recent reptiles possess numerous low sense-organs,&nbsp;“ tactile bodies,” in most parts of the skin, connected with&nbsp;the regional, spinal nerves. They are most obvious in snakes,&nbsp;appearing as one or more little colourless spots near the apex of&nbsp;each scale on the back. The spot is formed by a little cluster&nbsp;of epidermal cells, connected with a sensory nerve. Their&nbsp;lowest stage they show in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font0"> and in lizards, whilst in&nbsp;crocodiles they have reached a higher stage, at the bottom of&nbsp;the pit, since the tactile bodies, mostly several together, have&nbsp;sunk into the cutis, below the epiderm, forming a little pit,&nbsp;mostly near to the anterior margin of the flat scutes. They are&nbsp;most obvious on the belly of crocodiles, whilst in the American&nbsp;alligator such pits are scarcer, not because the organs are&nbsp;absent, but because these have sunk still farther into the skin.&nbsp;The last stage is that met with in tortoises, which possess such&nbsp;tactile bodies in considerable numbers in the softer subepidermal&nbsp;layers, beneath the large horny shields which themselves show no&nbsp;traces of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Taste.—</span><span class="font0">The respective organs do not seem to have been&nbsp;investigated. That they exist is amply proved by the careful&nbsp;predilection for certain kinds of food which is shown especially&nbsp;by vegetarian tortoises and lizards, independent of smell.&nbsp;AIany lizards are, for instance, very fond of sugar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nose.—</span><span class="font0">The sense of smell is well developed in all reptiles. In none is the olfactory organ degraded; that the nasal&nbsp;passages, the nose itself, are never degraded is explained by the&nbsp;fact that all reptiles invariably breathe through the nose, except&nbsp;snakes during the act of swallowing their prey. The nostrils,&nbsp;always paired, are frequently provided with valves, to shut out&nbsp;the water, or sand. In some water tortoises, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. Trionyx,&nbsp;ChelyI<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font0">  the nostrils are prolonged into a soft, unpaired proboscis.&nbsp;Double tubes exist in the snake </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Herpelon</span><span class="font0"> (see Snakes, Opis-thoglypha). The nostril leads into an antrum or vestibulum,&nbsp;this again into the nasal cavity proper, at the dorsal farther end&nbsp;enters the olfactory nerve, whilst ventrally it leads into the naso-laryngeal duct, with its posterior narial opening, or choana.&nbsp;The ducts are short in snakes and lizards, the choanae lying in the&nbsp;front part of the palate, but in tortoises and crocodiles they are&nbsp;placed far backwards, as·has been described under </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Skull</span><span class="font0"> above.&nbsp;Into the nasal cavity projects, from the septum, a concha, least&nbsp;developed in tortoises, most in lizards and snakes. Crocodiles&nbsp;show a beginning of separation into several conchae as in birds&nbsp;and mammals. A large nasal gland lies against the lateral, or&nbsp;ventral, side of the outer wall of the nasal cavity, into which also&nbsp;opens the naso-lacrymal duct. Jacobson’s organ, of uncertain&nbsp;function, is present in most reptiles. It is paired. In tortoises&nbsp;it is still placed within its nasal cavity, against the median wall,&nbsp;and is still nothing but a recess of the same and its mucous&nbsp;lining. In lizards and snakes the organ has become completely&nbsp;separated from the nasal cavity, lying below it and opening,&nbsp;each by a separate passage, into the palate mouth, close to or still&nbsp;within the choanae. In snakes it is mushroom-shaped, with a&nbsp;very short stalk. It lies immediately below the floor of the&nbsp;nasal capsule, and the membranous wall of the cavity on which&nbsp;it lies is covered and protected by a bone, commonly called the&nbsp;turbinal, which extends out from the median nasal system to&nbsp;the maxilla. In crocodiles these organs are vestigial and soon&nbsp;disappear:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ear.—</span><span class="font0">In crocodiles the outer ear lies in a recess, dorsally&nbsp;overhung by the lateral edge of the bony squamoso-frontal&nbsp;hridge; it carries a flap of skin, provided with muscles, to close the&nbsp;ear tightly. In lizards the outer ear is quite unprotected, and&nbsp;when the meatus is very short and wide, the drum is quite&nbsp;exposed. No reptiles possess cartilages comparable to the&nbsp;mammalian outer ear. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon,</span><span class="font0"> chameleons, snakes have&nbsp;no outer ear, the skin passing over the region. So also in&nbsp;tortoises, but in some of the aquatic kinds its position is well&nbsp;indicated by softer and thinner skin; in others, for instance&nbsp;marine turtles, a thick leathery plug, or a bigger scale&nbsp;marks the former position. In various lizards, chiefly burrowing in sand, the ear passage is very narrow, or closed. The&nbsp;middle ear or tympanic cavity is quite obliterated in snakes,&nbsp;Amphisbaenas and some other snake-shaped lizards. In&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anguis</span><span class="font0"> may exist individual traces. The cavity communicates&nbsp;with the mouth. In lizards the communication is a wide recess,&nbsp;lined with black pigment, so that in these creatures the whole&nbsp;auditory chain can easily be inspected from the opened mouth.&nbsp;In tortoises the recesses are contracted into the Eustachian&nbsp;tubes, each of which opens by a separate aperture into the roof&nbsp;of the mouth. In the crocodiles part of the cavities is transformed into an intricate system of canals and passages. The two&nbsp;Eustachian tubes open together in the mid-lines protected by a&nbsp;valve, between the basioccipital and basisphenoid; thence arises&nbsp;a median passage which with lateral arms and loops extends&nbsp;upward through the occiput into the cranial roof, communicating&nbsp;with the tympanic cavity, and further continued through the&nbsp;quadrates and beyond into the mandibles, by the siphonium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In spite of the obliterated tympanic cavity of snakes, and thc closed up outer ear passage and absence of a tympanic membrane&nbsp;in snakes and tortoises, these creatures can hear very well. The&nbsp;same applies to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphcnodon,</span><span class="font0"> but it seems doubtful whether&nbsp;chameleons can hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Through the whole middle ear, from the fenestra ovalis to the drum-membrane, stretches thc chain of auditory ossicles or&nbsp;cartilages, partly attached to the posterior w’all by the common&nbsp;lining membrane. The arrangement appears simplest in&nbsp;snakes, in chameleons and in tortoises, not because it is primitive&nbsp;but because it is so much reduced, partly in correlation with the&nbsp;abolition of the outer ear. In these creatures the columella&nbsp;goes as a bony, slender rod straight to the middle of the quadrate,&nbsp;against which it leans, or with which it articulates by a short&nbsp;piece of cartilage, the extra-columella. Here the whole chain&nbsp;ends. It looks like a proof that columella=Stapes, extracolumella= incus, and quadrate = malleus; or, w’ith the usual&nbsp;ignoring of the little extra-columellar piece, that quadrate =&nbsp;incus, Gegenbauris favourite impossibility. In those lizards&nbsp;which have a tympanic membrane conditions are far less reduced.&nbsp;The extra-columellar piece sends out three distal processes; one&nbsp;leans on to the middle of the tympanic membrane, the second&nbsp;usually is fastened to the bony dorsal rim of the meatus, the&nbsp;third is directed downwards and is continued as a thin ligament&nbsp;towards the inner angle of the articular of the mandible, but *&nbsp;before reaching this it comes to grief, being squeezed in between&nbsp;the quadrate and the posterior end of the pterygoid. The&nbsp;hyoid proper is of no account in snakes and tortoises, since&nbsp;it is reduced to very short distal pieces attached to the base&nbsp;of the tongue; but in lizards it remains in its OriginalJength, or&nbsp;it even lengthens, and shows many vagaries in its position and&nbsp;attachments. In embryos of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font0"> and lizards it arises from&nbsp;near the junction of the columella with the extra-columella. It&nbsp;becomes very long, too long for the available space (perhaps&nbsp;correlated with lingual functions), and it forms a high loop,&nbsp;thereby causing the peculiar loop of the chorda tympani; the&nbsp;upward bend of the hyoid becomes connected with the parotic&nbsp;process of the cranium. Next aborts the portion between this&nbsp;connexion and the original proximal end of the hyoid, near the&nbsp;columellar mass. The upper end of the hyoid </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">either</span><span class="font0"> remains&nbsp;attached to the parotic process (various lizards and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon)&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">whence the lingual apparatus remains suspended, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font0"> the hyoid,&nbsp;having broken loose, leaves a little cartilage, Versluy’s cartilage,&nbsp;behind, at the end of the parotic process, and the hyoid horn&nbsp;remains free, in the majority of lizards.
