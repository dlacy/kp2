John Rough, who had formerly been chaplain to the regent, entered the caſtle and joined them. At this time alſo John Knox began to diſtinguiſh himſelf in an eminent manner, both by his ſucceſs in argument and the unbounded freedom of his diſcourſe; while the Roman clergy, every where defeated and aſhamed, implored the aſſiſtance of the regent and his council, who aſſured them that the laws againſt heretics ſhould be put in execution.</p><p>In the mean time the caſtle of St Andrew’s being inveſted by a fleet of 16 ſail under admiral Strozzi from France, was obliged to capitulate. Honourable conditions were granted to the conſpirators; but after being conveyed to France, they were cruelly uſed, from the hatred entertained by the Catholics againſt the Proteſtants. Many were confined in priſons; and others, among whom, ſays Dr Stuart, was John Knox, were ſent to the galleys. The caſtle itſelf was raſed to the ground.</p><p>The ſame year, 1547, Scotland was invaded by an Engliſh army under the duke of Somerſet, who had been choſen protector of England during the minority of Edward VI. The deſign of this invaſion was to oblige the Scots to comply with the ſcheme of Henry VIII. and conclude a marriage between Edward and the young queen of Scotland. The Engliſh army conſiſted of 18,000 men; beſides which the protector had a fleet of 60 fail, one half of which were ſhips of war, and the others conſiſted of veſſels laden with proviſions and military ſtores. On the other hand, the regent oppoſed him with an army of 40,000 men. Before the commencement of hoſtilities, however, the duke of Somerſet addreſſed a letter or manifeſto to the government, in which he preſſed the marriage with ſuch powerful arguments, and ſo clearly ſhowed the benefits which would reſult from it to both nations, that the regent and his party, who were averſe to peace, thought proper to ſuppreſs it, and to circulate a report that the Engliſh had come to force away the queen, and to reduce the kingdom to a ſtate of dependence. All hopes of an accommodation being thus removed, the Engliſh army advanced in order to give battle to the Scots. They found the latter poſted in the moſt advantageous ſituation, around the villages of Muſſelburgh, Invereſk, and Monckton; ſo that he could not force them to an action, at the ſame time that he found himſelf in danger of having his communication with his ſhips cut off, which would have totally deprived his army of the means of ſubſiſtence. In this dangerous ſituation he had again recourſe to negociation, and offered terms ſtill more favourable than before. He now declared himſelf ready to retire into England, and to make ample compenſation for the injuries committed by his army, if the Scottiſh government would promiſe that the queen ſhould not be contracted to a foreign prince, but ſhould be kept at home till ſhe was of age to chooſe a huſband for herſelf, with the conſent of the nobility. Theſe conceſſions increaſed the confidence of the regent ſo much, that,</p><p>without taking advantage of the ſtrength of his ſituation, he reſolved to come to a general engagement.— The protector moved towards Pinkey, a gentleman’s houſe to the eaſtward of Muſſelburgh; and the regent conceiving that he meant to take refuge in his fleet, changed the ſtrong ground in which he was encamped. He commanded his army to paſs the river Eſk, and to approach the Engliſh forces, which were poſted on the middle of Faſideſhill. The earl of Angus led on the van; the main body of the battle marched under the regent; and the earl of Huntley commanded in the rear. It was the regent’s intention to ſeize the top of the hill. The lord Gray, to defeat this purpoſe, charged the earl of Angus, at the head of the Engliſh cavalry. They were received upon the points of the Scottiſh ſpears, which were longer than the lances of the Engliſh horſemen, and put to flight. The earl of Warwick, more ſucceſsful with his command of infantry, advanced to the attack. The ordnance from the fleet aſſiſted his operations; and a briſk fire from the Engliſh artillery, which was planted on a riſing ground, ſerved ſtill more to intimidate the Scottiſh ſoldiery.— The remaining troops under the protector were moving ſlowly, and in the beſt order, to take a ſhare in the engagement. The earl of Angus was not well ſupported by the regent and the earl of Huntley. A panic ſpread itſelf through the Scottiſh army. It fled in different ways, preſenting a ſcene of the greateſt havoc and confuſion. Few periſhed in the fight; but the chaſe continuing in one direction to Edinburgh, and in another to Dalkeith, with the utmoſt fury, a prodigious ſlaughter was made. The loſs of the conquerors did not amount to 500 men; but 10,000 ſoldiers periſhed on the fide of the vanquiſhed. A multitude of priſoners were taken; and among theſe the earl of Huntley, the lord high chancellor.</p><p>Amidſt the conſternation of this deciſive victory, the duke of Somerſet had a full opportunity of effectuating the marriage and union projected by Henry VIII. and on the ſubject of which ſuch fond anxiety was entertained by the Engliſh nation. But the cabals of his enemies threatening his deſtruction at home, he yielded to the neceſſities of his private ambition, and marched back into England. He took precautions, however, to ſecure an entry into Scotland, both by ſea and land. A garriſon of 200 men was placed in the iſle of St Columba in the Forth, and two ſhips of war were left as a guard to it. A garriſon was alſo ſtationed in the caſtle of Broughty, which was ſituated in the mouth of the Tay. When he paſſed through the Merſe and Teviotdale, the leading men of theſe counties repaired to him; and taking an oath of allegiance to king Edward, ſurrendered their places of ſtrength. Some of theſe he demoliſhed, and to others he added new fortifications. Hume caſtle was garriſoned with 200 men, and intruded to Sir Edward Dudley; and he poſted 300 ſoldiers, with 200 pioneers, in the caſtle of Roxburgh, under the command of Sir Ralph Bulmer.</p><p>The only reſource of the regent now was the hope of aſſiſtance from France. The young queen was lodged in the caſtle of Dumbarton, under the care of the lords Erſkine and Livingſtone; and ambaſſadors were ſent to Henry II. of France, acquainting him with the diſaſter at Pinkey, and imploring his aſſiſtance.
