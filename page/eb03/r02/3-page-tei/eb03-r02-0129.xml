The fathers could not agree in opinion. Some were for employing ſoft words and fair promiſes to quiet and gain over the moſt turbulent. But Appius’s advice prevailed : which was, that the conſuls ſhould call the people together, aſſure them that the patricians had not brought upon them the miſeries they ſuffered, and promiſe, on the part of the ſenate, all poſſible care to provide for their neceſſities ; but at the ſame time ſhould reprove the diſturbers of the public peace, and threaten them with the ſevereſt puniſhments if they did not amend their behaviour.</p><p>When the conſuls, towards the cloſe of the day, having aſtembled the people, would have ſigniſied to them the diſpoſition and intention of the ſenate, they were interrupted by the tribunes. A diſpute enſued, in which no order or decency was obſerved on either ſide. Several ſpeaking at the ſame time, and with great vopiſe-ιation, no one could be well underſtood by the audience. The conſuls judged, that being the ſuperior magiſtrates, their authority extended to all aſſemblies of the citizens. On the other ſide, it was pretended, that the aſſemblies of the people were the province of the tribunes, as the ſenate was that of the conſuls.</p><p>The diſpute grew warm, and both parties were ready to come to blows ; when Brutus having put ſome queſtions to the conſuls, ended it for that time. Next day he propoſed a law which was carried, that no perſon whatever ſhould interrupt a tribune when ſpeaking in an aſſembly of the people ; by which means the influence and power of the popular party was conſiderably increaſed, and the tribunes became formidable opponents to the conſuls and patricians. An opportunity ſoon offered for both parties to try their ſtrength. A great fleet of ſhips laden with com from Sicily, a great part of which was a preſent from Gelon the king of that country to the Romans, and the reſt purchaſed by the ſenate with the public money, raiſed their ſpirits once more.</p><p>But Coriolanus incurred their reſentment, by inſiſt-ing that it ſhould not be diſtributed till the grievances of the ſenate were removed. For this, the tribunes ſum-monei him to a trial before the people, under pretence that he aſpired at the ſovereignty.</p><p>When the appointed day was come, all perſons were filled with the greateſt expectations, and a vaſt con-courſe from the adjacent country aſſembled and filled up the forum. Coriolanus, upon this, preſented himſelf before the people with a degree of intrepidity that merited better fortune. His graceful perſon, his perſuaſive eloquence, the cries of thoſe whom he had ſaved from the enemy, inclined the auditors to relent. But being confounded with a new charge which he did not expect, of having embezzled the plunder of Antium, the tribunes immediately took the votes, and Coriolanus was condemned to perpetual exile.</p><p>This ſentence againſt their braveſt defender ſtruck the whole body of the ſenate with ſorrow, conſternation, and regret. Coriolanus alone, in the midſt of the tumult, ſeemed an unconcerned ſpectator. He returned home, followed by the lamentations of hundreds of the moſt reſpectable ſenators and citizens of Rome, to take a laſting leave of his wife, his children, and his mother Yeturia. Thue recommending his little children to their care, he left the city, without followers or fortune, to take refuge with Tullus Attius, aman of great power among the Volſcians, who took him under his protection, and eſpouſed his quarrel.</p><p>The firſt thing to be done, was to induce the Volſci to break the league which had been made with Rome; and for this purpoſe Tullus ſent many of his citizens thither, in order to ſee ſome games"at that time celebrating ; but at the ſame time gave the ſenate private information, that the ſtrangers had dangerous intentions of burning the city. This had the deſired effect ; the ſenate iſſued an order that all ſtrangers, whoever they were, ſhould depart ſrom Rome before ſun-ſet. This order Tullus repreſented to his countrymen as an infraction of the treaty, and procured an embaſſy to Rome, complaining of the breach, and demanding back all the territories belonging to the Volſcians, of which they had been violently diſpoſſeſſed ; declaring, war in caſe of a refuſal : but this meſſage was treated by the ſenate with contempt.</p><p>War being thus declared on both ſides, Coriolanus and Tullus were made generals of the Volſcians ; and accordingly invaded the Roman territories, ravaging and laying waſte all ſuch lands as belonged to the plebeians, but letting thoſe of the ſenators remain untouched. In the mean time, the levies w<hi rend="sup">τ</hi>ent on very ſlowly at Rome ; the two conſuls, who were re-elected by the people, ſeemed but little ſkilled in war, and even feared to eιaco unter a general whom they knew to be their ſuperior in the field. The allies alſo ſhowed their fears, and ilowly brought in their, ſuccours ; ſo that. Coriolanus continued to take their towns one after the other. Fortune followed him in every expedition ; and he was now ſo famous for his victories, that, the Volſei left their towns, deſenceleſs to follow him into the field. The very ſoldiers of his colleague’s aιmy came over to him, and would acknowledge no other general. Thus finding himſelf unoppoſed in the field, and at the head of a numerous army, he at length inveſted the city of Rome itſelf, fully reſolved to beſiege it. It was then that the ſenate and the people unanimouily agreed to ſend deputies to him, with propoſals of reſtoration, in caſe he ſhould draw off his army. Coriolanus received their propoſals at the head of his principal officers, and, with the ſternneſs of a general that was to give the law, refuſed their offers.</p><p>Another embaſſy was now ſent forth, conjuring him not to exact from, his native city aught but what became Romans to grant. Coriolanus, however, ſtill perſiſted in his former demands, and granted them but three days in which to finiſh their deliberations. In this exigence, all that was left, was another deputation ſtill more ſolemn than either of the former, compoſed of the pontiffs, the prieſts, and the augurs. Theſe, cloathed in their habits of ceremony, and with a grave and mournful deportment, iſſued ſrom the city, and entered the camp of the conqueror : but all in vain, they found him ſevere and inflexible as before.</p><p>When the people ſaw them return ineffectually, they began to give up the commonwealth as loſt. Their temples were filled with old men, with women and children, who, proſtrate at their altars, put up their ardent prayers ſor the preſervation of their country. Nothing was to be heard but anguiſh and lamentation, nothing to be ſeen but ſcenes of affright and diſtreſs, At length</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
