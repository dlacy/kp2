It was in advance of the period to which it is always referred. The necessity of conferring the franchise upon the plebeians had not been sufficiently felt, consequently the patrician order, the ancient Roman populus, could not endure the admission of a new and recently conquered people to any thing even approaching an equality. Hence their enmity against Servius, and their concurrence in the ambition of Tarquinius, afterwards sumamed Super-bus. On their part, it was a plot to overturn the new constitution, and deprive the plebeians of the rights and privileges conferred upon them by that wise and patriotic monarch. The introduction of the plebeians may perhaps have been too early even for their own good, as they had been too recently united to Rome to have thoroughly acquired the true Roman spirit; and they needed to purchase their privileges more dearly, by a lengthened and fluctuating struggle, in order that they might sufficiently prize them. For men always value most what they have with the greatest difficulty acquired. And, besides, the arrangement was too completely military to be perfectly adapted to the more peaceful spirit and structure of a purely civil economy. It was also of too sudden formation, not only that the people were not ripe for it, but that it did not, by its deliberate growth, tend to ripen them. In its gradual formation afterwards, every sucessive stage was sharply contested, and hardly won. The principles of law and justice, municipal and natural, on which they rested, were all made manifest in the course of the contest ; so that not only a sound civil polity was at length established, but, at the same time, there was formed a code of laws based on principles so profound and true, as to entitle them to be retained as the foundation of all laws, to all civilized nations, from that period to the present, and probably to the end of time.</p><p>SECTION π.</p><p>Scarcely hail the Romans succeeded in raising a portion of the city out of its ashes, when they were again involved in war. The various states and nations who had been reduced to subjection in previous wars, seemed to regard the humbled state of Rome as affording a propitious opportunity, not only of recovering their freedom, but of crushing a dangerous neighbour. The next year after the burning of Rome by the Gauls, the Latins and Hernicans revolted; while the Volscians declared open war, and invaded the lands of their weakened antagonist. But Camillus was at the head of the state, and his military genius enabled him to lead the feeble remains of the Roman armies to victory over their ungenerous foes. The Æquians had themselves suffered from the march of a part of tbe Gauls through their country into Apulia; yet they also took up arms against Rome, and were defeated. Meanwhile the Etrurians assailed the Romans in another quarter ; and Camillus was compelled to march against them, when again victory crowned bis exertions.</p><p>In a short time afterwards, the Latins and Hernicans having united their forces, struck such apprehension into the Romans, that as Camillus could not be spared from Rome, on account ofthe dissensions by which the state was agitated, Cossus was appointed dictator, and sent against them. He not only gained a complete victory over them, but also established a colony at Satricum. The Prænestines sustained a severe defeat; and on all sides the Romans repelled their assailants, and even began to extend the boundaries of the republic.</p><p>But while victory attended the Roman arms in these contests, the dangers arising from intestine broils became more and more urgent The state of confusion in public matters, caused by the destruction of all public records, rendered it possible for the ruling orders to levy taxes and contributions from the plebeian order beyond their due proportion. That they did so may be fairly conjectured from the fact, that no accurate census was taken during fifteen years after the burning of the city, while taxes were levied by rates merely conjectural, and, we need scarcely add, with partiality and oppression. The building of the houses being, in a great measure, a public work, was done at the public expense, and the commons were, in many instances, enjoined to bear their proportion of the pecuniary burden, even after their whole property had been assigned to the patricians to whom they had been indebted. This necessarily plunged them deeper and deeper into debt ; until the dungeons in the houses of the patricians became filled with their ruined countrymen in the sad condition of <hi rend="italic">nexi,</hi>  or persons assigned to slavery for life, for the payment of their debts. Censors had indeed been appointed, but no census was taken, so that the oppressive effects of continuing to exact a heavy tax from people whose property had already been alienated by debt, as if that property were still their own, continued unabated.</p><p>Manlius, the brave defender of the Capitol, took upon himself the dangerous task of defending the oppressed people. His seeming patriotism was, in all probability, increased by disappointed ambition, the influence of Camillus being too powerful for him. He publicly sold an estate, and with the produce paid the debts of a number of the oppressed plebeians. He next proposed the sale of public lands for the same object ; and also accused the government ofhaving concealed the money said to have been recovered from the Gauls, for the purpose of appropriating it to themselves. For this and similar conduct, he was accused of sedition and cast into prison ; but so formidable was the appearance ofhis friends, that the senate restored him to liberty. This only encouraged Manlius to persevere in his violent course ; and at last availing himself of his house in the Capitol he seized on that citadel, and was immediately accused of aiming at kingly power. On this accusation he was condemned to be thrown from the Tarpeian rock; his house in the Capitol was razed to the ground, and it was decreed that no member ofthe Manlian house should ever afterwards bear the name of Marcus. Such is the most common account given of this transaction ; though there are others which differ considerably, both representing the conduct of Manlius in a much more favourable light, and relating his death differently. His death, however, unquestionably occasioned an accession of strength to the patricians, and in a corresponding degree weakened and dispirited the plebeians. Additional taxes were levied for the rebuilding of the walls ; and by a sad consequence, additional debts were incurred by the oppressed commons, and greater numbers thrown into prison, or reduced to a state of servile dependence. All the privileges and rights for which the commons had so long and perseveringly striven, were wτested from them one by one, and the city seemed to be on the point of sinking into the wretched and powerless condition of being the abode of tyrannous patrician citizens, and degraded plebeian slaves.</p><p>But two men, equal to tlle emergency, were raised up to rescue the Roman state from its danger. These were two of the tribunes of the people, Caius Licinius Stolo and Lucius Sextius. In their patriotic endeavours they were aided by the influence of Marcus Fabius Ambustus, whose daughter had been given in marriage to Licinius. By their energetic and persevering efforts these tribunes so ingratiated themselves with the commons, that year after year they were re-elected tribunes, gained over their colleagues, concentrated public opinion, met and counterbalanced the influence of the patricians, and after a struggle of five years, carried three new laws, which may be said to have completed the fabric of Roman liberty. One of these was an agrarian law, prohibiting</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
