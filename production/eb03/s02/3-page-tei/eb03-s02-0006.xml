Hepburn acquainted him with all the feuds and animoſities which raged among the great families of Scotland, their ferocious character, and barbarous behaviour to their enemies. He repreſented the civil power as too weak to curb theſe potent chieftains; and gave it as his opinion that the regent’s adminiſtration ought to be ſupported by foreign arms, meaning thoſe of France.</p><p>Hepburn is ſaid alſo to have gained an aſcendency over the regent by means of large ſums of money laid out among his domeſtics, by a fawning and plauſible addreſs, and by well-directed flatteries; and he employed this aſcendency to deſtroy thoſe who were obnoxious to himſelf. The earl of Hume, as being the firſt ſubject in rank and authority, became obnoxious to the regent through the inſinuations of Hepburn; and as that nobleman had frequent occaſion to be at court in virtue of his office of chamberlain, he ſoon perceived that neither he nor his friends were welcome gueſts there. Alarmed for his own ſafety, he reſolved to form a party alongſt with the queen-mother and her new huſband againſt the regent. This was by no means a difficult taſk: for the queen naturally imagined that her new huſband ought to have had ſome ſhare in the government; and the earl of Angus readily concurred in the  ſcheme. In the mean time, the regent was making a progreſs. through Scotland, while bloody feuds were raging among the nobles: but before any remedy could be applied to theſe diſorders, he was informed of the ſchemes laid by the queen-mother and her party; and that ſhe had reſolved to fly into England with her two infants. On this he inſtantly returned to Edinburgh; and, as no time was to be loſt, ſet out at midnight that very night, and ſurpriſed the caſtle of Stirling, where he found the queen-mother and her two infants.</p><p>The regent, after this bold ſtep, took care to ſhow that the care of the royal infants was his chief ſtudy. As he himſelf was nearly allied to the crown, in order to remove all ſuſpicions and calumnies on that account, he committed the care of the king and his brother to three noblemen of the moſt unexceptionable characters in the kingdom, but of whom we now know the name only of one, viz. the earl of Lenox. They were appointed to attend the princes by turns; to whom alſo a guard, conſiſting partly of French and partly of Scots, was aſſigned; and the queen-mother was left at liberty to reſde where ſhe pleaſed.</p><p>The earl of Hume, finding his ſchemes thus abortive, retired to his own eſtate; from whence he was ſoon after drawn, and obliged to fly into England, by the earls of Arran and Lenox. The queen-mother retired to a monaſtery at Coldſtream; and meſſengers were diſpatched to the court of England, to know how Henry would have his ſiſter diſpoſed of. He ordered the lord Dacres, his warden of the marches, to attend her to Harbottle-caſtle in Northumberland; and here ſhe was delivered of her daughter the Lady Mary Douglas, mother to Henry lord Darnley, father to James I. of England. The regent diſpatched ambaſſadors to Henry, in order to vindicate his own conduct. He likewiſe ſent to aſſure the queen that ſhe had nothing to fear in Scotland; and to invite her to return thither, where ſhe ſhould at all times be admitted to ſee her children. This offer, however, ſhe declined; and ſet out for London, where ſhe was affectionately received and entertained by her brother. But in the mean time many diſorders were committed throughout the kingdom by the party of the queen-mother; though, by the interpoſition of archbiſhop Forman, they were at preſent terminated without bloodſhed, and ſome of the principal offenders were perſuaded to return to their duty. Among theſe was the earl of Angus himſelf, the queen’s huſband; which when king Henry heard, he exclaimed, "That the earl, by deſerting his wife, had acted <hi rend="italic">like a Scot."</hi> Lord Hume refuſed to ſurrender himſelf, or to accept of the regent’s terms; and was of conſequence declared a traitor, and his eſtate confiſcated. All this time he had been infeſting the borders at the head of a lawleſs banditti; and now he began to commit ſuch devaſtations, that the regent found it neceffary to march againſt him at the head of 1000 diſciplined troops. Hume being obliged to lay down his arms, was ſent priſoner to Edinburgh caſtle; where the regent very unaccountably committed him to the charge of his brother-in-law the earl of Arran. Hume eaſily found means to gain over this near relation to his own party; and both of them, in the month of October 1515, eſcaped to the borders, where they ſoon renewed hoſtilities. Both the earls were now proclaimed traitors, but Hume was allowed fifteen days to ſurrender himſelf. This ſhort interval the regent employed in quaſhing the rebellion, for which purpoſe the parliament had allowed him 15,000 men. He beſieged the caſtle of Hamilton, the earl of Arran’s chief ſeat, which was in no condition of defence: but he was prevailed upon by Arran’s mother, daughter to James II. and aunt to the regent himſelf, to forbear further hoſtilities, and even to pardon her ſon, provided he ſhould return to his duty. Arran accordingly ſubmitted; but the public tranquillity was not by that means reſtored. An aſſociation, at the head of which was the earl of Moray, the king’s natural brother, had been formed againſt the earl of Huntley. That nobleman was too well attended to fear any danger by day; but his enemies found means to introduce ſome armed troops in the nighttime into Edinburgh. On this a fierce ſkirmiſh enſued, in which ſome were killed on both ſides; but farther bloodſhed was prevented by the regent, who confined all the lords in priſon till he had brought about a general reconciliation. One Hay, who had been very active in ſtirring up the quarrels, was baniſhed to France; and only the earl of Hume now continued in arms.</p><p>In 1516 died the young duke of Rotheſay: an event which brought the regent one degree nearer the crown, ſo that he was declared heir in cafe of the demiſe of young James. Negociations were then entered into about prolonging the truce which at that time ſubſiſted with England; but Henry inſiſting upon a removal of the regent from his place, they were for the preſent dropped. Finding, however, that he could neither prevail on the parliament as a body to diſmiſs the regent, nor form a party of any cooſequence againſt him,</p></body></text></TEI>
