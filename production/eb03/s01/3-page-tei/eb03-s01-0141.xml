The male and female of this infect are very eaſily diſtinguiſhable; the male being ſmaller and leſs hairy. The female brings forth her young alive, and perfect in their kind. Redi having bought a quantity of ſcorpions, ſelected the females, which, by their ſize and roughneſs, were eaſily diſtinguiſhable from the reſt, and putting them in ſeparate glaſs veſſels, he kept them for ſome days without food. In about five days one of them brought forth 38 young ones, well-ſhaped, and of a milk-white colour, which changed every day more and more into a dark ruſty hue. Another female, in a different veſſel, brought forth 27 of the ſame colour; and the day following the young ones ſeemed all fixed to the back and belly of the female. For near a fortnight all theſe continued alive and well: but afterwards ſome of them died daily; until, in about a month, they all died except two.</p><p>Were it worth the trouble, theſe animals, might be kept living as long as curioſity ſhould think proper. Their chief food is worms and infects; and upon a proper ſupply of theſe, their lives might be lengthened to their natural extent. How long that may be, we are not told; but if we may argue from analogy, it cannot be leſs than ſeven or eight years; and perhaps, in the larger kind, double that duration. As they have ſomewhat the form of the lobſter, ſo they reſemble that animal in caſting their ſhell, or more properly their ſkin; ſince it is softer by far than the covering of the lobſter, and ſet with hairs, which grow from it in great abundance, particularly at the joinings. The young lie in the womb of the parent, each covered up in its own membrane, to the number of 40 or 50, and united to each other by an oblong thread, ſo as to exhibit altogether the form of a chaplet.</p><p>Such is the manner in which the common ſcorpion produces its young: but there is a ſcorpion of America produced from the egg, in the manner of the ſpider. The eggs are no longer than pins points; and they are depoſited in a web, which they ſpin from their bodies, and carry about with them, till they are hatched. As ſoon as the young ones are excluded from the ſhell, they get upon the back of the parent, who turns  her tail over them, and defends them with her ſting. It ſeems probable, therefore, that captivity produces that unnatural diſpoſition in the ſcorpion which induces it to deſtroy its young; ſince, at liberty, it is found to protect them with ſuch unceaſing aſſiduity. For the various modes of preventing the fatal conſequences of the bites of theſe and other noxious animals, we refer to Moſeley’s treatiſe above quoted.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scorpio, </hi><hi rend="italic">Scorpion,</hi> in aſtronomy, the eighth ſign of the zodiac denoted by the character m.

It is an annual plant, with trailing herbaceous ſtalks, which at each joint have a ſpatular-ſhaped leaf with a long foot-ſtalk. From the wings of the leaves come out the foot-ſtalks oſ the flowers, which ſuſtain at the top one yellow butterfly flower, ſucceeded by a thick twiſted pod having the ſize and appearance of a larger caterpillar, from whence it had this title. This has long been preſerved in the gardens of this country, more on account of its odd ſhape than for any great beauty. It is propagated by lowing the ſeeds on a bed of light earth; and when the plants come up, they muſt be kept free from weeds and thinned, ſo that there may be a foot diſtance between them.</p><p>SCORZONERA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Viper-grass,</hi> in botany: A genus of the polygamia æqualis order, belonging to the ſyngeneſia claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 49th order, <hi rend="italic">Compositœ.</hi> The receptacle is naked; the pappus plumy; the calyx imbricated, with ſcales membranaceous on their margins.</p><p>The moſt remarkable ſpecies is the hiſpanica, or common ſcorzonera, which is cultivated in the gardens of this country, both for culinary and medicinal purpoſes. The root is carrot-ſhaped, about the thickneſs of a finger, covered with a dark brown ſkin, is white within, and has a milky juice. The ſtalk riſes three feet high, is ſmooth, branching at the top, and garniſhed with a few narrow leaves, whoſe baſe half embrace the ſtalk The flowers are of a bright yellow colour, and terminate the ſtalks in ſcaly empalements compoſed of many narrow tongue-ſhaped hermaphrodite florets lying imbricatim over each other like the ſcales of fiſh, and are of a bright yellow colour. After theſe are decayed, the germen, which fits in the common empalements, turns to oblong cornered ſeeds, having a roundiſh ball of feathered down at the top This plant is propagated by ſeeds; and muſt be carefully thinned and kept free from weeds, otherwiſe the plants will be weak.</p><p>The roots of ſcorzonera were formerly much celebrated for their alexipharmic virtues, and for throwing out the ſmall-pox; but have now almoſt entirely loſt their character: however, as they abound with an acrid juice, they may ſometimes be of uſe for ſtrengthening the viſcera, and promoting the fluid ſecretions.</p><p>SCOT, a cuſtomary contribution laid upon all ſubjects, according to their abilities.
