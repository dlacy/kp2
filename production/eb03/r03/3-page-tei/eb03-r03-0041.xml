This we learn, by comparing the value of CO with that oſ'CP in art. 30. This being the caſe, it follows, that if an external force is applied in a direction paſſing thro’ O, perpendicularly to CO, it will produce the ſame initial velocity of the centre as if the body were free : for as it exerts no preſſure on the points of ſupport, the initial motion muſt be the ſame as if they were not there.</p><p>If the external force be applied at a greater diſtance in the line CG, the velocity of the centre will be greater than if the body were free. In this caſe the preſ-fure excited in the axis will be backward, and conſequently the points of ſupport will re-act forward, and this re-action will be equivalent to another external force conſpiring with the one applied at O. Some curious conſequences may be deduced from this.</p><p>If the external force be applied to a point in the line GC, lying beyond C, the motion of the centre will be in the oppoſite direction to what it would have taken had the body been free, and ſo will be the preſ-ſures exerted by the points of ſupport on the axis.</p><p>A force w.GI applied at P produces the initial pro-<hi rend="sup">; </hi>greſſive motion rc.GH ; and<hi rend="italic">any</hi>  force applied at O, perpendicularly to CG, produces the ſame motion of the centre as if the body were free. Therefore a force m.GH applied thus at O will produce a motion w.GIT in the centre, and therefore the ſame motion which τw.Gl applied at P would produce ; and it will produce the momentum wz.GI at P. Therefore if a force equal to the progreſſive motion of the body be applied at O, perpendicularly to CO, in the oppoſite direction, ft wfill ſtop all this motion wfithout exciting any ſtrain on the axis or points of ſuppoit. Therefore the equivalent of all the motions of each particle round C is conceived as paſſing through O in a direction perpendicular to CO ; and the blow given by that point to any body oppoſed to its motion is conſidered as equal to the compounded effect of the rotatory motion, or to the progreſſive motion of the body combined with its rotation.</p><p>For ſuch reafons O has been called the Centre of Percussion of the body turning round C. But the name of <hi rend="italic">centre of momentum,</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">rotatory effort,</hi>  would have been more proper.</p><p>We can feel this property of the point O when we give a ſmart blow with a flick. If we give it a motion round the joint of the wriſt only, and ſtrike ſmart-ly with a point conſiderably nearer or more remote than τ of its length, we feel a painful ſhock or wrench in the hand ; but if we ſtrike with that point which is preciſely at y of its length, we feel no ſuch diſagreeable ſtrain.</p><p>Mechanical writers frequently ſay, that O conſidered as the centre of percuſſion, is that with which the moſt violent blow is ſtruck. But this is by no means true; O is that point of a body turning round C which gives a blow preciſely equal to the progreſſive motion of the body, and in the ſame direction. As we have already ſaid, it is the point where we may ſuppoſe the whole rotatory momentum of the body accumulated. Every particle of the body is moving in a particular direction, with a velocity proportional to its diſtance from the axis of rotation ; and iſ the body were ſtopped in any point, each particle tending to continue its motion endeavours to drag the reſt along with it. Whatever point we call the centre of percuſſion ſhould have this property, that when it is ſtopped by a ſuſſicient force, the whole motion and tendency to motion of every kind ſhould be ſtopped ; ſo that if at that inſtant the ſupports of the axis were annihilated, the body would remain in abſolute reſt.</p><p>The conſideration of a veιy ſimple caſe will ſhow that this point of ſtoppage cannot be taken indifferently. Suppoſe a ſquare or rectangular board CDD'C', fig. 4. advancing in jthe direction GH, perpendicular to its plane, without any rotation. Let G be the centre of gravity, and the middle of the board. It is evident, that if a force be applied at G, in the direction HG,</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
