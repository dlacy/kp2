For though rivers proceed originally from ſprings, yet, by their rapid motion, and by being expoſed during a long courſe to the influence of the ſun and air, the earthy and metallic ſalts which they contain are decompoſed, the acid flies off, and the terreſtrial parts precipitate to the bottom. Rivers are alſo rendered ſofter by the vaſt quantity of rain-water, which, paſſing along the ſurface of the earth, is conveyed into their channels. But all rivers carry with them a great deal of mud and other impurities; and, when they flow near large and populous towns, they become impregnated with a number of heterogeneous fubſtances, in which ſtate the water is certainly unfit for the purpoſes of life; yet, by remaining for ſome time at reſt, all the feculen-cicsfubſide, and the water becomes ſufficiently pure and potable.</p><p>RIVERS (Earl). See Wodevile.</p><p>RIVINIA, in botany : A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the tetfandria claſs of plants.—The perianth is four-leaved, coloured, and permanent, the leaflet oblong-egged and obtuſe ; there is no corolla, unleſs the calyx be conſidered as ſuch. There are four or eight filaments, ſhorter than the calyx, approaching by pairs, permanent ; the anthers are ſmall. The germ is large and roundiſh ; the ſtyle very ſhort ; the ſtigma ſimple and obtuſe. The berry is globular, fitting on the green reflected calyx, one-celled with an incurved point. There is one ſeed, lensform and rugged. This plant is called <hi rend="italic">Solenoides</hi>  by Tournefort, and <hi rend="italic">Piercea</hi>  by Miller. It grows naturally in moſt of the iſlands of the Weft Indies. The juice of the berries of the plant wall ftain paper and linen of a bright red colour, and many experiments made with it to colour flowers have ſuc-ceeded extremely well in the following manner : the juice of the berries was preſſed out, and mixed with common water, putting it into a phial, ſhaking it well together for ſome time, till the water was thoroughly tinged ; then the flowers, which were white and juſt fully blown, were cut off, and their ſtalks placed into the phial ; and in one night the flowers have been finely variegated with red ; the flowers on which the experiments were made were the tuberoſe, and the double ’white narciſſus.</p><p>RIVULET, a diminutive of river.

They uſually ſtrengthened the ground by ramming it, laying it with flints, pebbles, or ſands, and ſometimes with a lining of maſonry, rubbiſh, bricks, &amp;c. bound together with mortar. In ſome places in the Lionoîs, F. Meneſtrier obſerves, that he has found huge cluſters of flints cemented with lime, reaching io or 12 ſeet deep, and making a maſs as hard and compact as marble ; and which, after rtſiſting the injuries of time for 1600 years, is ſtill ſcarce penetrable by all the force of hammers, mattocks, &amp;c. and yet the flints it conſiſts of are not bigger than eggs. The moſt noble of the Roman roads was the λζia Appia, which was carried to ſuch a</p><lb/><p>vaſt length, that Procopius reckons it five days journey to the end of it, and Leipſius computes it at 350 miles; it is 12 ſeet broad, and made of ſquare ſree-ſtone generally a foot and a half on each ſide ; and though this has laſted for above 1800 years, yet in many places it is for ſeveral miles together as entire as when it was firſt made.</p><p>The ancient roads are diſtinguiſhed into military roads, double roads, ſubterraneous roads, &amp;c. The military roads were grand roads, formed by the Romans for marching their armies into the provinces of the empire ; the principal of theſe Roman roads in England are Watling-ſtreet, Tkenild-ſtreet, Foſs-way, and Erminage-ſtreet. Double roads among the Romans, were roads for carriages, with two pavements, the one for thoſe going one way, and the other for thoſe returning the other : theſe were ſeparated from each other by a cauſeway raiſed in the middle, paved with bricks, for the conveniency of foot paſſengers ; with borders and mounting ſtones from ſpace to ſpace, and military columns to mark the diſtance. Subterraneous roads are thoſe dug through a rock, and left vaulted ; as that of Puzzuoli near Naples, which is near half a league long, and is 15 feet broad and as many high.</p><p>The firſt law enacted reſpecting highways and roads in England was in the year 1285 ; when the lords of the ſoil were enjoined to enlarge thoſe <hi rend="italic">ways</hi>  where buſh-es, woods, or ditches be, in order to prevent robberies. The next law was made by Edward III. in the year 1346 ; when a commiſſion was granted by the king to lay a toll on all ſorts of carriages paſſing from the hoſ-pital of St Giles in the fields to the bar of the Old Temple, and alſo through another highway called <hi rend="italic">Port-pool</hi>  (now Gray’s Inn Lane) joined to the before-named highway ; which roads were become almoſt impaſſable. Little further relating to this ſubject occurs, till the reign of Henry VIII. when the pariſhes were entruſt-ed with the care of the roads, and ſurveyors were annually elected to take care of them. But the increaſe of luxury and commerce introduced ſuch a number of heavy carriages for the conveyance of goods, and lighter ones for the convenience and eaſe of travelling, that pariſh aid was found inſufficient to keep the beſt frequented roads in repair. This introduced toll-gates or turnpikes ; that ſomething might be paid towards their ſupport by every individual who enjoyed the benefit ol theſe improvements, by paſſing over the roads.</p><p>Speaking of roads, the Abbé Raynal juſtly remarks. “ Let us travel over all the countries of the earth, and wherever we ſhall find no facility of trading from a city to a town, and from a village to a hamlet, we may pronounce the people to be barbarians ; and we ſhall only be deceived reſpecting the degree of barbariſm.”</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Road, in navigation, a bay, or place of anchorage, at ſome diſtance from the ſhore, whither ſhips or veſſels occaſionally repair to receive intelligence, orders, or neceſſary ſupplies ; or to wait for a fair wind, &amp;c. The excellence of a road conſiſts chiefly in its being protected from the reigning winds and the ſwell of the ſea ; in having a good anchoring-ground, and being at a competent diſtance from the ſhore.
