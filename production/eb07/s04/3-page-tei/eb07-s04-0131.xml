Much air was thus liberated, and more was got rid of by agitation, in the manner of the water hammer, and by leaving it standing for some time erect, until at last I got it so free from air, that when I raised it upright, it supported a column of mercury 34 inches high ; and no vacuum was formed until it was violently shaken, when it fell down suddenly and settled at 28.75 inches, but upon being inclined, a speck of air always remained, though, when it was expanded by a pillar of mercury 27 inches high, this speck was not larger than a pin’s head.</p><p>In this state, when the tube was perpendicular, I found the mercury to stand at 28.75 inches, the column of water above it was about 6½ inches, = half an inch of mercury. The whole then being 29.25 inches, when the stationary barometer stood at 29.4, the difference, or pillar supported by the elasticity of the steam = 0.15 inch. The water in the pan was then heated exceedingly slowly by a lamp, and stirred continually by a feather to make the heat as equal as possible.

When this solution was perfectly saturated by boiling, and was put into the tube, it precipitated a quantity of salt which disturbed the experiment. I was therefore obliged to take it out, and filter it, during which process it attracted moisture from the air, and appeared, by its boiling point, not to be perfectly saturated. Though it was more free from air than water is, yet it parted from what it contained with great difficulty, and would part with none when shaken as a water-hammer, though it opened in all parts of the liquor.

A thermometer was fixed in another opening, so that the bulb was in the inside of the digester, and the stem and scale without ; and the bulb was kept half an inch from the cover of the digester by a wooden collar. The cover being fixed on tight, and the digester half filled with water, it was heated by means of a large lamp.</p><p>The air in the upper part of the digester expanding by heat, the column of mercury in the tube was considerably raised by that expansion before the water boiled. The air was let out, and the water heated to boiling ; still, however, some air remained, for the mercury stood at 213½°.
