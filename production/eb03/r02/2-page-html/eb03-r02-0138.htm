<p><span class="font1">ved </span><span class="font0">ſparingly from the public ſtock, and</span><span class="font1"> a </span><span class="font0">little meaſure of wine out of his ſcanty allowance. An inconſiderable&nbsp;preſent indeed in itſelf, but very acceptable at that time&nbsp;to the perſon on whom it was beſtowed. The tribune’s&nbsp;next care was to puniſh the negligent: accordingly the&nbsp;captain of the guard, who ought to have had an eye&nbsp;over the centinels, was condemned to die, and, purſuant&nbsp;to his ſentence, thrown down ſrom the top of the capitol. The Romans extended their puniſhments and rewards even to the animals. Geeſe were ever after had&nbsp;in honour at Rome, and a flock of them always kept&nbsp;at the expence of the public. A golden image of a&nbsp;gooſe was erected in memory of them, and a gooſe every&nbsp;year carried in triumph upon a ſoft litter finely adorned; whilſt dogs were held in abhorrence by the Romans, who every year impaled one of them on a branch&nbsp;of elder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The blockade of the Capitol had already laſted ſeven months; ſo that the famine began to be very ſenſibly&nbsp;felt both by the beſieged and beſiegers. Camillus,&nbsp;ſince his nomination to the dictatorſhip, being maſter&nbsp;of the country, had poſted ſtrong guards on all the&nbsp;roads; ſo that the Gauls dared not ſtir out for fear&nbsp;of being cut to pieces. Thus Brennus, who beſieged&nbsp;the Capitol, was beſieged himſelf, and ſuffered the ſame&nbsp;inconveniences which he made the Romans undergo.&nbsp;Beſides, a plague raged in his camp, which was placed&nbsp;in the midſt of the ruins of the demoliſhed city, his men&nbsp;lying confuſedly among the dead carcaſes of the Romans, whom they had ſlain, and not buried. So great&nbsp;a number of them died in one quarter of the city, that&nbsp;it was afterwards called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Buſta Gallica,</span><span class="font0"> or the place&nbsp;where the dead bodies of the Gauls were burnt. But,&nbsp;in the mean time, the Romans in the Capitol were&nbsp;more pinched with want than the Gauls. They were&nbsp;reduced to the laſt extremity, and at the ſame time ignorant both of the lamentable condition to which the&nbsp;enemy’s army was brought, and of the ſteps Camillus&nbsp;was taking to relieve them. That great general only&nbsp;waited for a favourable opportunity to fall upon the&nbsp;enemy; but, in the mean time, ſuffered them to pine&nbsp;away in their infected camp, not knowing the extreme&nbsp;want the Romans endured in the Capitol, where they&nbsp;were ſo deſtitute of all ſorts of proviſions, that they&nbsp;could no longer ſubſiſt. Matters being brought to this&nbsp;ſad paſs on both ſides, the centinels of the Capitol, and&nbsp;thoſe of the enemy’s army, began to talk to one another of an accommodation. Their diſcourſes came at&nbsp;length to the ears of their leaders, who were not averſe&nbsp;to the deſign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſenate, not knowing what was become of Camillus, and finding themſelves hard pinched by hunger, reſolved to enter upon a negotiation, and empowered Sulpitius, one of the military tribunes, to treat with the Gauls; who made no great difficulty in coming to&nbsp;terms, they being no leſs deſirous than the Romans to&nbsp;put an end to the war. In a conference, therefore, between Brennus and Sulpitius, an agreement was made,&nbsp;and ſworn to. The Romans were to pay to the Gauls&nbsp;1000 pounds weight of gold, that is, 45, 000l. Sterling;&nbsp;and the latter were to raiſe the ſiege of the Capitol,&nbsp;and quit all the Roman territories. </span><span class="font1">On </span><span class="font0">the day appointed, Sulpitius brought the ſum agreed on, and&nbsp;Brennus the ſcales and weights; for there were no gold&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or ſilver coins at that time, metals </span><span class="font0">paſſing only by</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">weight. We are told, that the weights </span><span class="font1">of the Gauls </span><span class="font0">were falſe, and their ſcales untrue; which Sulpitius complaining of, Brennus, inſtead of redreſſing the injuſtice, threw his ſword and belt into the ſcale where&nbsp;the weights were; and when the tribune aſked him the&nbsp;meaning of ſo extraordinary a behaviour, the only anſwer he gave was, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ve</span><span class="font0"> </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">victis!</span><span class="font0"> “ Wo to the conquered! ”&nbsp;Sulpitius was ſo ſtung with this haughty anſwer, that&nbsp;he was for carrying the gold back into the Capitol,&nbsp;and ſuſtaining the ſiege to the laſt extremity; but&nbsp;others thought it adviſable to put up the affront, ſince&nbsp;they had ſubmitted to a far greater one, which was to&nbsp;pay any thing at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During theſe diſputes of the Roman deputies among themſelves and with the Gauls, Camillus advanced with,&nbsp;his army to the very gates of the city; and being there&nbsp;informed of what was doing, he commanded the main&nbsp;body to follow him ſlowly and in good order, while he,&nbsp;with the choiceſt of his men, haſtened to the place of&nbsp;the parley. The Romans, overjoyed at his unexpected&nbsp;arrival, opened to make room for him as the ſupreme&nbsp;magiſtrate of the republic, gave him an account of the&nbsp;treaty they had made with the Gauls, and complained&nbsp;of the wrong Brennus did them in the execution of it.&nbsp;They had ſcarce done ſpeaking, when Camillus cried&nbsp;out, “ Carry back this gold into the Capitol; and you;&nbsp;Gauls, retire with your ſcales and weights. Rome&nbsp;muſt not be redeemed with gold, but with ſteel. Brennus replied, That he contravened a treaty which was&nbsp;concluded and confirmed with mutual oaths. “ Be it&nbsp;ſo (anſwered Camillus); yet it is of no force, having&nbsp;been made by an inferior magiſtrate, without the privity or conſent of the dictator. I, who am inveſted with&nbsp;the ſupreme authority over the Romans, declare the&nbsp;contract void. ” At theſe words Brennus flew into </span><span class="font1">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">rage; and both ſides drawing their ſwords, a confuſed&nbsp;ſcuffle enſued among the ruins of the houſes, and in the&nbsp;narrow lanes. The Gauls, after an inconſiderable loſs,&nbsp;thought fit to retire within their camp; which they&nbsp;abandoned in the night, not caring to engage Camillus’s whole army, and, having marched eight miles, encamped on the Gabinian way. Camillus purſued them&nbsp;as ſoon as it was day, and, coming up with them, gave&nbsp;them a total overthrow. The Gauls, according to Livy, made but a faint reſiſtance, being diſheartened at the&nbsp;loſs they had ſuſtained the day before. It was not,&nbsp;ſays that author, ſo much a battle as a ſlaughter. Many of the Gauls were ſlain in the action, more in the&nbsp;purſuit; but the greater number were cut off, as they&nbsp;wandered up and down in the fields, by the inhabitants&nbsp;of the neighbouring villages. In ſhort, there was not&nbsp;one ſingle Gaul leſt to carry to his countrymen the news of this fatal cataſtrophe. The camp of the barbarians was plundered; and Camillus, loaded with&nbsp;ſpoils, returned in triumph to the city, the ſoldiers in&nbsp;their ſongs ſtyling him, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Romulus, Father of his country,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Second founder of Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As the houſes of Rome were all demoliſhed, and the walls razed, the tribunes of the people renewed, with&nbsp;more warmth than ever, an old project which had occa-ſioned great diſputes. They had formerly propoſed </span><span class="font1">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">law ſor dividing the ſenate. and government between&nbsp;the cities of Veii and Rome. Now this law was revived; nay, moſt of the tribunes were for entirely abandoning their old ruined city, and </span><span class="font1">making Veii </span><span class="font0">the ſole</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
