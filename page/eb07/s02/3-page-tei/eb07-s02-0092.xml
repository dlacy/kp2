He died, as Lipsius conjectures, in the sixty-third or sixty-fourth year of his age, and in about the tenth or eleventh of Nero’s reign. Tacitus, on mentioning his death, observes, that, as he entered the bath, he took of the water, and with it sprinkled some of his nearest domestics, saying, “ that he offered these libations to Jupiter the Deliverer.” These words are an evident proof that Seneca was not a Christian, as some have imagined him to have been ; and that the thirteen epistles from Seneca to St Paul, and from St Paul to Seneca, are supposititious pieces. The writings of Seneca, excepting his books of Physical Questions, are chiefly of a moral kind. They consist of a hundred and twenty-four epistles, and distinct treatises on Anger, Consolation, Providence, Tranquillity of Mind, Constancy, Clemency, The Shortness of Life, Happiness, Retirement, and Benefits. A number of tragedies are extant under the name of Seneca, and written in a vicious style ; but it is uncertain whether the whole or any part of them were his. The first good edition of his acknowledged works was published by Justus Lipsius, which was succeeded by the <hi rend="italic">Variorum,</hi> 1672, three vols. 8vo, and others. Of the tragedies, the best are that of Scriverius, 1621, the <hi rend="italic">Variorum, </hi>1651, and Schroeder's, 1728, 4to.</p><p>SENEGAL, a great river of Western Africa, which, like the Gambia and Rio Grande, has its source in a group of mountains situated a short distance to the north-west of Temboo, in Foota Jallon. Mollien places the source of the Ba Fing, the middle branch of the Senegal, in latitude 10° 10' north, longitude 11° 18' west; and that of the Falerne, the western branch, in latitude 10° 20' north, and longitude 11° west. This traveller thus describes the spot whence the former mighty stream issues. “ Ascending the stream, I perceived two basins, one above the other, from which the water gushed forth ; and still higher a third, which was only humid, as well as the channel that led to the basin immediately below it. The negroes consider the upper basin as the principal source of the river. These three springs were situated about the middle of the side of the mountain. In the rainy season, two ponds, at equal distances above the upper source, supply it with water by two deep channels. The Senegal, called Baleo (Black River) in the Poula language, and Bafing in Maudingo, which has the same signification, or Foura, which means simply the river, runs at first from north to south, then passes at a little distance to the south of Teembo, and afterwards pursues a western direction,” which, we may add, it maintains till its embouchure in the Atlantic Ocean. We are indebted chiefly to the enterprises of the French for our knowledge of the Senegal, of which river they were long the sole masters as high as the cataract of Feloo, and at the mouth of which they fixed the capital of the factories they possessed from Arguin to Sierra Leone. Amongst the copious descriptions of this great river, we avail ourselves of that of M. Golberry. The course of the Senegal, from its mouth to the rock of Feloo, the boundary of French navigation, is nearly 280 leagues, although the distance in a direct line is not more than 160 leagues. This cataract, which is situated sixty miles above Galam, is the principal one on the river ; forty miles above it is that of Govinea. The windings of the Senegal are remarkably tortuous and circuitous. As far as the rock of Feloo, the country through which it flows is a level, having so small an inclination that a very slight interruption is sufficient to divert the course of the stream, so that it frequently seems on the point of returning to its source. It is only navigable during the rainy season ; but Adanson informs us that he found the river, at its greatest ebb, from twenty to thirty feet deep at Podor, sixty leagues up, where, however, the influence of the tide reaches. The greatest rise of the tide at the mouth of the river is two feet and a half. Here there is a bar, which prevents the entrance of all vessels drawing ten feet</p><p>of water, although immediately within it there is sufficient depth for ships of any size. The entrance of the bar has shifted from time to time, owing to the influence of opposing currents. Sand-banks and rocks embarrass the navigation ; enormous trees and portions of the bank are continually borne down by the current; frequent hurricanes and storms are encountered, followed by dead calms; and the burning atmosphere, when not violently agitated, becomes extremely oppressive, so that the voyage into the interior has always proved highly detrimental to Europeans. Were it not for these perils, it would be particularly interesting to the naturalist, as the extremely picturesque banks present a rich variety of the noblest productions of the vegetable kingdom, whilst the extensive forests abound with all kinds of wild animals. Amongst others, elephants are seen in large troops. In the shallow parts of the river are a vast number of hippopotami, and caymans of prodigious size. The whole length of the river is estimated at 800 miles, its embouchure taking place in latitude 16° 5' north. About eight leagues below Galam, at the village of Tafa- lisga, the Senegal receives the Falemé, which may be navigated during the rainy season by vessels of sixty tons. The easterly and inferior arm of the Senegal, called the Kokora, is formed of a number of streams which rise between 5° and 7° of west longitude, and 12° and 13° of north latitude. The Ba Fing and the Kokora unite a short distance above Feloo, and the combined streams then take the name of the Senegal.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Isle of </hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">Senegal,</hi> sometimes called <hi rend="italic">Saint Louis,</hi> is a small island in the mouth of the river Senegal, and, according to Maskelyne’s tables, is situated in long. 16.31.

N.</p><p>SENEGAMBIA, a large country of Africa, on the Atlantic Ocean, lying between the rivers Senegal and Gambia, from the mouth of the Nunez to Portendik, with several adjoining districts, and extending from 8° to 18° 20' of north latitude, and from about 5° to 17° 30'30'' of west longitude. It is bounded on the west by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by Guinea, on the east by Nigritia or Soudan, and on the north by the great desert of Sahara. This fine territory lies upon the western and northern declivities of the mountains of Kong, which here stretch from east to west in some degree parallel with the Gulf of Guinea, and is separated by the great valley of the Quorra or Niger from that part of the northern table or terrace land in which the elevated portion of Africa sinks into Soudan. The interior of this extensive tract of high land, called High Soudan, whose southern limit towards the Gulf of Guinea more especially bears the name of the Kong Mountains, is wholly unknown to us ; but its general height is not more than two thousand feet above the level of the sea. It appears to be fine pasture-land, to have an excellent climate, and to support a vast number of African tribes. Surrounding it on the west and north, are those table-lands called the Wildernesses of Jallonkadu, which are only inhabited by wild beasts and reptiles, and through which Mungo Park travelled five days without seeing the face of man. But beyond these to the north and west extends a fertile country, rich in streams, which descend to the coast in a westerly or north-westerly direction. Immediately north from Sierra Leone the fruitful part of the coast is narrow, but enlarges as we proceed in the same direction, especially where the mountains on the middle of the Gambia fall back to the east ; and on the Senegal it expands into broad plains, which reach to the foot of the highlands already mentioned. The principal capes upon the coast arc called Verga, Roxo, St Mary, and Verd. The low parts of this tract of country are reckoned amongst the hottest on the globe, the average temperature throughout the year being 63° Fahrenheit ; but the heat is of course moderated on the mountainous districts and high table-lands.
