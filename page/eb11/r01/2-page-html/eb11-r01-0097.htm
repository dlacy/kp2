<p><span class="font4">sleepers (which are of iron) are very portable, and skilled labour is not required to lay or to take them up; the making of a&nbsp;“ turn-out ” is easy, by taking out a 15 ft. section of the way&nbsp;and substituting a section with points and crossings. The safe&nbsp;load per wheel varies between 12 cwt. on a 10 in. 16 lb wheel&nbsp;and 40 cwt. on an 18 in. 56 lb wheel. The rolling stock is constructed either for farm produce or heavy minerals, the latter&nbsp;holding 10 to 27 cub. ft. For timber, 4 or 5 ft. bogies can&nbsp;be used. A useful wagon for agricultural transport on a 24 in.&nbsp;gauge line is 16 ft. long by 5 ft. wide; it weighs 72 cwt. and&nbsp;costs £30. A portable line of this kind will have 20 lb steel rails&nbsp;and 2112 steel sleepers—4 ft. 6 in. long—to a mile, laid 2 ft. 6 in.&nbsp;apart centre to centre. The total cost per mile of such a line,&nbsp;including all bolts, nuts, fish-plates and fastenings, ready for&nbsp;laying, delivered in the United Kingdom, is under £500 a mile.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">RAIMBACH, ABRAHAM (1776-1843), English line-engraver, a Swiss by descent, was born in London in 1776. Educated at&nbsp;Archbishop Tenison’s Library School, he was an apprentice to&nbsp;J. Hall the engraver from 1789 to 1796. For nine years part of&nbsp;his working-time was devoted to the study of drawing in the&nbsp;Royal Academy and to executing occasional engravings for the&nbsp;booksellers, whilst his leisure hours were employed in painting&nbsp;portraits in miniature. Having formed an intimacy with Sir&nbsp;David Wilkie, Raimbach in 1812 began to engrave some of that&nbsp;master’s best pictures. At his death, in 1843, he held a gold&nbsp;medal awarded to him for his “ Village Politicians ” at the&nbsp;Paris Exhibition of 1814. He was elected corresponding member&nbsp;of the Institute of France in 1835. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">RAIMUND, FERDINAND (1790-1836), Austrian actor and dramatist, was bom on the 1st of June 1790, in Vienna. In&nbsp;1814 he acted at the Josefstädter Theater, and in 1817 at the&nbsp;Leopoldstädter Theater. In 1823 he produced his first play,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Der </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Barοlnetermαcher auf der Zauberinsel,</span><span class="font4"> which was followed&nbsp;by </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Der Diamant des Geisterkönigs</span><span class="font4"> (1824) and the still popular&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bauer als Millionär,</span><span class="font4"> The last-mentioned play, which appeared&nbsp;in 1826, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Der Alpenkönig und der Menschenfeind</span><span class="font4"> (1828) and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Der&nbsp;Verschwender</span><span class="font4"> (1833) are Raimund’s masterpieces. He committed suicide on the 5th of September 1836, owing to the fear&nbsp;that he had been bitten by a mad dog. Raimund was a master&nbsp;of the Viennese </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Posse</span><span class="font4"> or farce; his rich humour is seen to&nbsp;best advantage in his realistic portraits of his fellow-citizens.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">RAINBOW, formerly known as the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">iris,</span><span class="font4"> the coloured rings seen in the heavens when the light from the sun or moon shines&nbsp;on falling rain; on a smaller scale they may be observed when&nbsp;sunshine falls on the spray of a waterfall or fountain. The&nbsp;bows assume the form of concentric circular arcs, having their&nbsp;common centre on the line joining the eye of the observer to the&nbsp;sun. Generally only one bow is clearly seen; this is known as&nbsp;the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">primary rainbow;</span><span class="font4"> it has an angular radius of about 41°,&nbsp;and exhibits a fine display of the colours of the spectrum, being&nbsp;red on the outside and violet on the inside. Sometimes an&nbsp;outer bow, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">secondary rainbow,</span><span class="font4"> is observed; this is much&nbsp;fainter than the primary bow, and it exhibits the same play of&nbsp;colours, with the important distinction that the order is reversed,&nbsp;the red being inside and the violet outside. Its angular radius is&nbsp;about 57°. It is also to be noticed that the space between the&nbsp;two bows is considerably darker than the rest of the sky. In&nbsp;addition to these prominent features, there are sometimes to be&nbsp;seen a number of coloured bands, situated at or near the summits&nbsp;of the bows, close to the inner edge of the primary and the&nbsp;outer edge of the secondary bow; these are known as the&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">spurious, supernumerary</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">complementary rainbows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The formation of the rainbow in the heavens after or during a shower must have attracted the attention of man in remote&nbsp;antiquity. The earliest references are to be found in the various&nbsp;accounts of the Deluge. In the Biblical narrative (Gen. ix. 12-17)&nbsp;the bow is introduced as a sign of the covenant between God and&nbsp;man, a figure without a parallel in the other accounts. Among&nbsp;the Greeks and Romans various speculations as to the cause of&nbsp;the bow were indulged in; Aristotle, in his </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Meteors,</span><span class="font4"> erroneously&nbsp;ascribes it to the reflection of the sun’s rays by the rain; Seneca&nbsp;adopted the same view. The introduction of the idea that the&nbsp;phenomenon was caused by refraction is to be assigned to&nbsp;Vitellio. The same conception was utilized by Theodoric of&nbsp;Vriberg, a Dominican, who wrote at some time between 1304&nbsp;and 1311 a tract entitled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">De radialibus impressionibus,</span><span class="font4"> in which&nbsp; he showed how the primary how is formed by two refractions&nbsp;and one internal reflection; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.</span><span class="font4"> the light enters the drop and is&nbsp;refracted; the refracted ray is then reflected at the opposite&nbsp;surface of the drop, and leaves the drop at the same side at which&nbsp;it enters, being again refracted. It is difficult to determine the&nbsp;influence which the writings of Theodoric had on his successors;&nbsp;his works were apparently unknown until they were discovered&nbsp;by G. B. Venturi at Basel, partly in the city library and partly&nbsp;in the library of the Dominican monastery. A full account,&nbsp;together with other early contributions to the science of light, is&nbsp;given in Venturi’s </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Commentari sopra la stοria de la Teoria del&nbsp;Ottica</span><span class="font4"> (Bologna, 1814). John Fleischer (sometimes incorrectly&nbsp;named Fletcher), of Breslau, propounded the same view in a&nbsp;pamphlet, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">De iridibus doctrina Aristotelis et Vitellonis</span><span class="font4"> (1574);&nbsp;the same explanation was given by Franciscus Maurolycus in his&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Photismi de lumine et umbra</span><span class="font4"> (1575).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The most valuable of all the earlier contributions to the scientific explanation of rainbows is undoubtedly a treatise&nbsp;by Marco Antonio de Dominis (1566-1624), archbishop of&nbsp;Spalatro. This work, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">De radiis visūs et lucis in υitris per spec-tiυis et iride,</span><span class="font4"> published at Venice in 1611 by J. Bartolus, although&nbsp;written some twenty years previously, contains a chapter&nbsp;entitled “ Vera iridis tota generatio explicatur, ” in which it is&nbsp;shown how the primary how is formed by two refractions and&nbsp;one reflection, and the secondary bow by two refractions and two&nbsp;reflections. Descartes strengthened these views, both by experiments and geometrical investigations, in his </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Meteors</span><span class="font4"> (Leiden,&nbsp;1637). He employed the law of refraction (discovered by&nbsp;W. Snellius) to calculate the radii of the bows, and his theoretical&nbsp;angles were in agreement with those observed. His methods,&nbsp;however, were not free from tentative assumptions, and were&nbsp;considerably improved by Edmund Halley </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Phil. Trans.,</span><span class="font4"> 1700,&nbsp;714). Descartes, however, could advance no satisfactory&nbsp;explanation of the chromatic displays; this was effected by&nbsp;Sir Isaac Newton, who, having explained how white light is&nbsp;composed of rays possessing all degrees of refrangibility, was&nbsp;enabled to demonstrate that the order of the colours was in&nbsp;perfect accord with the requirements of theory (see Newton’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Opticks,</span><span class="font4"> book i. part 2, prop. 9).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The geometrical theory, which formed the basis of the investigations of Descartes and Newton, afforded no explanation of the supernumerary bows, and about a century elapsed before&nbsp;an explanation was forthcoming. This was given by Thomas&nbsp;Young, who, in the Bakerian lecture delivered before the Royal&nbsp;Society on the 24th of November 1803, applied his principle</span></p>
