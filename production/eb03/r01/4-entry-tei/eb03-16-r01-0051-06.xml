                <p><label>REGATA</label> or Regatta, a ſpecies of amuſement peculiar to the republic
                    of venice. This fpectacle has the power of exciting the greateſt emotions of the
                    heart, admiration, enthufiaſm, a ſenſe of glory, and the whole train of our beſt
                    feelings. The grand regata is only exhibited on particular occaſions, as the
                    vifits of foreign princes and kings at venice.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to givc a juſt idea of the ardour that the notice of a <hi
                        rend="italic"> regata</hi> ſpreads among all claffes of the inhabitants of
                    venice. Proud of the exclufive privilege of giving inch a fpectacle, through the
                    wonderful local cir-cumſtances of their city, they are highly delighted with
                    making preparations a long tinie before, in order to contribute all they can
                    towards the perfection and enjoyment of the fpectacle. A thouſand intereſts are
                    formed and augmented every day ; parties in favour of the different competitors
                    who are known j the protection of young</p>
                <p>noblemen given to the gondoliers in their ſervice ; the deiire ot honours and
                    rewards in the aſpirants ; aud, in the midft of all this, that ingenious
                    national induſtry, which awakes the Venetians from their habitual indolence, to
                    derive advantage from the bufineſs and agita-tioπ of the moment : all theſe
                    circumſtances united give to the numerous inhabitants of this lively city a
                    degree of ſpirit and animation which render it during that time a delightful
                    abode in the eyes of the philoſopher and the ſtranger. Crowds of people flock
                    from the adjacent parts, and travellers joyfully repair to thi3 ſcene of gaiety
                    and pleaſure.</p>
                <p>Although it is allowable for any man to go and in-ſcribe his name in the liſt of
                    combatants until the fixed number is complete, it will not be amiſs to remark
                    one thing, which has relation to more ancient times. The ſtate of a
                        gondolier<note anchored="true" place="margin" type="authorial" n="1">See <hi
                            rend="italic">Gondola</hi>.</note> is of much confideration among the
                    people ; whieh is very natural, that having been the primitive condition of the
                    inhabitants of this country. But, befides this general confideration, there are
                    among them ſome families truly diſtinguiſhed and reſpected by their equals,
                    whoſe antiquity is acknowledged, and who, on account of a. ſucceſiion of
                    virtuous men, able in their profeſſion, and honoured for the prizes they have
                    carried oft in theſe conteſts, form the body of noble gondoliers ; often more
                    worthy of that title than the higher order of nobility, who only derive their
                    honours from the merit of their anceſtors, or from their own riches. The
                    confideration for thoſe families is carried ſo far, that, in the diſputes
                    frequently arifing among· the gondoliers in their ordinary paffage of the
                    canals, we ſometimes ſee a quarrel inffantly made up, by the fimple
                    interpofition of a third perſon, who has chanced to be of this reverend body.
                    They are rigid with reſpect to mif∙ alliances in their families, and they
                    endeavour reciprocally to give and take their wives among thoſe of their own
                    rank. But we muſt remark here, with pleaſure, that thefe diſtinctions infer no
                    inequality of condition, nor admit any oppreſſion of inferiors, being founded
                    ſolely on laudable and virtuous opinions. Diſtinctions derived ſrom fortune
                    only, are thoſe which always out-rage nature, and often virtue.</p>
                <p>In general, the competitors at the great regatas are choſen from among thele
                    families ol reputation. As ſoon as they are fixed upon for this exploit, they
                    ſpend the intermediate time in preparing themſelves for it, by a daily aſſiduous
                    and fatiguing exerciſe» If they are in ſervice, their maſters during that time
                    not only give them their liberty, but aſſo augment their wages. This cuſtom
                    would ſeem to indicate, that they look upon them as perſons coniecrated to the
                    honour of the nation, and under a fort of obligation to contribute to its glory.</p>
                <p>At laſt the great day arrives. Their relations affem-ble together : they
                    encourage the heroes, by calling to their minds the records of their families ;
                    the women preſent the oar, beſeeching them, in an epic tone, to remember that
                    they are the ſons of famous men, whoſe ſteps they will be expected to follow :
                    this they do with as much ſolemnity as the Spartan women preſented the ſhield to
                    their ſons, bidding them either return with or upon it. Religion, as practiſed
                    among the lower claſs of people, <hi rend="sub">j</hi> has its flιare in the
                    preparations for this en» terprize. They cauſe maffes to be ſaid ; they make
                    vows to ſome particular church ; and they arm their boats for the contell with,
                    the images of thoſe faint» who are moſt in vogue. Sorcerers are not forgotten</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0052" facs="gri_33125011196389_0058.tif"/>
                <p>upon this occaſion. For gondoliers who have loſt the race often declare, that
                    witchcraft had been practiſed againſt them, or certainly they muſt have won the
                    day. Such a ſuppoſition prevents a poor fellow from thinking ill of himſelf ; an
                    opinion that might be favourable to him another time.</p>
                <p>The courſe is about four miles. Tlie boats ſtart ſrom a certain place, run
                    through the great winding canal, which divides the town into two parts, turn
                    round a picket-, and, coming back the fame way, go and ſeize the prize, which is
                    fixed at the acuteſt angle of the great canal, on the convex ſide, ſo that the
                    point of fight may he the more extended, and the prize ſeized in the ſight of
                    the ſpectators on both ſides.</p>
                <p>According to the number of competitors, different races are performed in
                    different ſorts of boats ; ſome with ∙ one oar and others with two. The prizes
                    propoſed are four, indicated by four flags of different colours, with the
                    different value of the prizes marked upon them.— Theſe flags, public and
                    glorious monuments, are the prizes to which the competitors particularly aſpire.
                    But the government always adds to each a genteel ſum of money ; befides that the
                    conquerors, immediately after the victory, are ſurroundtd by all the <hi
                        rend="italic"> beau monde,</hi> who congratulate and make them pref <hi
                        rend="sup"> ,</hi> μts ; after which they go, bearing their honourable
                    trophy in their hand, down the whole length of the canal, and receive the
                    applauſe of innumerable fpectat0r3.</p>
                <p>This grand canal, ever ſtriking by the ſingularity and beauty of the buildings
                    which border it, is, upon theſe occaſions, covered with an infinity of
                    ſpectators, in all ſorts of barges, boats, and gondolas. The element on whieh
                    they move is ſearcely ſeen ; but the noiſe of' oars, the agitation of arms and
                    bodies in perpetual motion, indicate tbe fpectacle to be upon the water. At
                    certain diſtances, on each ſide of the ſhore, are erected little amphitheatres
                    and ſcaffoldings, where are placed bands of muſic ; the harmonious found of
                    which predominates now and then over the buzzing nυile of the people. Some days
                    before a <hi rend="italic">regata,</hi> one may ſee on the great canal many
                    boats for pleafιue and entertainment. The young noble, the citizen, the rich
                    artizan, mounts a long boat of ſix or eight oars ; his gondoliers decorated with
                    rich and ſingular dreffes, and the veffel itſelf adorned with various ſtuffs.
                    Among the nobles there are always a number who are at a conſiderable expence in
                    theſe decorations ; and at the <hi rend="italic">regate</hi> it-ſelf ' exhibit
                    on the water perſonages of mythologie ſtory, with the heroes of antiquity in
                    their train, or amufe themſelves with repreſenting the coſtumi of different
                    nations ; in ſhort, people contribute with a mad fort of magnificence, from all
                    quarters, to this maſque-rade, the favourite diverlion of the venetians. But
                    theſe great machines, not being the lefs in motion on account of their
                    ornaments, are not merely deſtined to grace the ſhow : they are employed at the
                    regata, at every moment, to range the people, to protect the courſe, and to keep
                    the avenue open and clear to the goal. The nobility, kneeling upon cuſhions at
                    the prow of their veffels, are attentive to theſe matters, and announce their
                    orders to the moſt reſtive, by darting at them Jittle gilded or ſilvered balls,
                    by means of certain bows, with which they are furniſhed on this occaſion.</p>
                <p>And this is the only appearance of coercion in the VC-uetian police on theſe
                    days of the greateſt tumult : nor is there to be ſeen, in any part of the city,
                    a body of guards or patrol, nor even a gun or a halbert. The mildneſs of the
                    nation, its gaiety, its education in the habit oſ believing that the government
                    is ever awake, that it knows and fees every thing ; its reſpectfid attachment to
                    the body of patricians ; the ſole afpect of certain officers of the police in
                    their robes, diſperſed in different places, at once operate and explain that
                    tran-quillity, that ſecurity, which we ſee in the midſt oſ the greateſt
                    confuſion, and that ſurpriſing docility in ſo lively and fiery a people.
                    Regattas have been attempted on the river Thames, but they were but humble
                    imitations oſ tbe venetian amuſement.</p>
