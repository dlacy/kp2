<p><span class="font0">first plebeian chief pontiff, of giving advice in law in public had a still greater effect in popularizing it ; and the Jus Aelianum, some&nbsp;fifty years later—a collection that included the Tables, the iηter-pretatio, and the current styles of actions—made it as much the&nbsp;heritage of the laity as of the pontifical college.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Subsequent Legislation.—</span><span class="font1">Of legislation during the fourth and fifth centuries that affected the private law we have&nbsp;but scanty record. The best-known enactments are the&nbsp;Canuleian law of 309 repealing the decemviral prohibition&nbsp;of marriages between patricians and plebeians ; the Genu-cian, Marcian, and other laws about usury and the rate of&nbsp;interest; the Pœtilian law of 428, abolishing the nexal&nbsp;contract ; the Silian law, probably not long afterwards,&nbsp;which introduced a new form of process for actions of&nbsp;debt and appears to have given statutory sanction to the&nbsp;stipulation (in its earliest form of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sponsio)</span><span class="font1"> ; and the Aquilian&nbsp;law of 467, which amended the decemviral provisions about&nbsp;actions of damages for culpable injury to property, and&nbsp;continued to regulate the law on the subject even in the&nbsp;books of Justinian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">II. The Actions of the Law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Legis Actiones generally.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup>—</span><span class="font1">We owe to Gaius the only connected (though, owing to the state of the Verona&nbsp;MS., rather fragmentary) account we possess of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legis&nbsp;actiones,</span><span class="font1"> as the system of judicial procedure was called&nbsp;which prevailed in Rome down to the substitution of that&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per formulas</span><span class="font1"> by the Æbutian and Julian laws,—the first&nbsp;early in the sixth century of the city, and the second in&nbsp;the age of Augustus. He tells us that as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">genera agendi</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;generic forms of process they were five in number, each&nbsp;taking its name from its characteristic feature, viz., (1)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sacramento,</span><span class="font1"> (2) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per judicis postulαtionem</span><span class="font1"> (3) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per condic-tionem,</span><span class="font1"> (4) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per manus injectionem,</span><span class="font1"> and (5) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per pignoris&nbsp;capionem.</span><span class="font1"> The third was unknown in the decemviral&nbsp;period, and was introduced by the Silian law alluded to in&nbsp;last paragraph. The other four were all more or less regulated by the XII. Tables, but must in some form have&nbsp;been anterior to them. It is utterly impossible, however,&nbsp;to say of any one of them at what time it was introduced,&nbsp;or what was the statute (Zez) by which it was sanctioned ;&nbsp;it may well be that they were not of statutory introduction&nbsp;at all, but were called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legis actiones</span><span class="font1"> simply because recognized and indirectly confirmed by the Tables. In character and purpose they were very different. The first three&nbsp;were directly employed for determining a question of right&nbsp;or liability, which, if persistently disputed, inevitably resulted in a judicial inquiry. The fourth and fifth might&nbsp;possibly result in judicial intervention ; but primarily they&nbsp;were proceedings in execution, in which the party moving&nbsp;in them worked out his own remedy. As regards their&nbsp;comparative antiquity there is much to be said for the&nbsp;opinion of Ihering and Bekker that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manus injectio,</span><span class="font1"> as essentially nothing more than regulated self-help, must have been&nbsp;the earliest of the five, and that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legis actio Sacramento&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judicis postulatio</span><span class="font1"> must have been introduced in aid&nbsp;of it, and to prevent too hasty resort to it where there was&nbsp;room for doubt upon question either of fact or law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the three judicial legis actiones the first step was the in jus voeatio or procedure for bringing the respondent into court, minutely</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">regulated by the provisions of the first of the XΠ. Tables. This duty was not committed to any officers of the law ; there was no&nbsp;writ of summons of any sort ; the party moving in the contemplated&nbsp;litigation had himself to do what was needed. Once before the&nbsp;magistrate (consul or prætor), the plaintiff stated his contention.&nbsp;If admitted unqualifiedly by the defendant, the magistrate at once&nbsp;pronounced his decree, leaving the plaintifi' to work out his remedy&nbsp;as the law prescribed. But, if the case presented was met either&nbsp;with a denial or a qualified defence, and appeared to the magistrate&nbsp;to be one proper for trial, he remitted it for that purpose either to&nbsp;the centumviral tribunal or to one or more private citizens as judges&nbsp;or arbiters. The act of remit was technically litis cœntestatio or&nbsp;ordinatio judixvi, the first so named because originally the parties&nbsp;called upon those present to be witnesses to the issue that was being&nbsp;sent for trial. This was the ordinary practice under both the system&nbsp;of the legis actiones and that of the formulae, and prevailed until&nbsp;the time of Diocletian. In the first stage the proceedings were said&nbsp;to be in jure, and the duties of the magistrate in reference to them&nbsp;made up his jurisdictiο ; in the second they were said to be in&nbsp;judirio, those presiding in it being styled judixes. All that the&nbsp;judge or judges had to do was to pass judgment on the question&nbsp;remitted to them. They were “ right-declarers ” only, not “ right-enforcers.” If their judgment was for the plaintiff, and he failed&nbsp;to obtain an amicable settlement, he had himself to make it operative by subsequent proceedings by manus injeetio, and that under&nbsp;the eye of the magistrate, not of the judge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From an enumeration in Cicero of a variety of causes proper to the centumviral court the conclusion seems warranted that it was&nbsp;its peculiar province to decide questions of quiritary right in the&nbsp;strictest acceptation of the word. They were all apparently real&nbsp;actions ipindicationes'),—claims of property in land or of servitudes&nbsp;over it, of right as heir under a testament or in opposition to it, of&nbsp;rights of tutory and succession ab intestalo as agnate or gentile, and&nbsp;so forth. In all these it was a numerous court of Quirites, advised&nbsp;in the early republic by a pontiff, that determined by its vote the&nbsp;question of quiritary right submitted to it. Many such questions&nbsp;in course of time, and possibly at first of express consent of parties,&nbsp;came to be referred to a single judge ; but some, and notably claims&nbsp;of inheritance under or in opposition to a testament, were still&nbsp;remitted to the centumviral court in the classical period. Personal&nbsp;actions, however, do not appear ever to have fallen within its cognizance : they were usually sent to a single judge—a private citizen&nbsp;—selected by the parties, but appointed by the magistrate, and to&nbsp;whom the latter administered an oath of office. But, in a few cases in&nbsp;which an action involved not so much a disputed question of right&nbsp;as the exercise of skill and discretion in determining the nature&nbsp;and extent of a right that in the abstract was not denied, the remit&nbsp;was to a plurality of private judges or arbiters, usually three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Legis Actio Sacramento.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup>—</span><span class="font1">The characteristic feature of this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legis actio,</span><span class="font1"> as described by Gaius, was that the parties,&nbsp;after a somewhat dramatic performance before the consul or&nbsp;prætor, each challenged the other to stake a certain sum, the&nbsp;amount of which was fixed by the Tables, and which was&nbsp;to abide the issue of the inquiry by the court or judge to&nbsp;whom the cause was eventually remitted. This stake Gaius&nbsp;refers to indifferently as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sacramentum, summa sacramenti,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">poena sacramenti.</span><span class="font1"> The formal question the court had&nbsp;to determine was,—whose stake had been justified, whose&nbsp;not </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(cujus sacramentum justum, cujus injustum)</span><span class="font1"> ; the first&nbsp;was returned to the staker, the second forfeited originally&nbsp;to sacred and afterwards to public uses. But the decision&nbsp;on this formal question necessarily involved a judgment&nbsp;on the matter actually in dispute, and, if it was for the&nbsp;plaintiff, entitled him, failing an amicable arrangement, to&nbsp;take ulterior steps for making it effectual. The procedure&nbsp;was still employed in the time of Gaius in the few cases</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
