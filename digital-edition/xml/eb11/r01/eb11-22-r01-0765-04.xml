<p><label>RABA BEN JOSEPH BEN ḤAMA</label> (c. 280-352), Babylonian rabbi or amora. He is closely associated in his studies with Abaye. The latter was head of the Academy at Pumbeditha. Raba founded a new school at Maḥuza, which eventually became so long as Raba lived the only academy in Babylonia (Persia). The development of Talmudic Law (or <hi rend="italic">Halakhah)</hi> was much indebted to this rabbi, whose influence in all branches of Jewish learning was supreme. His friendship with the King Shapur II. enabled Raba to secure a relaxation of the oppressive laws enacted against the Jews of Persia.</p><p>See Graetz, <hi rend="italic">History of the Jews;</hi> (Eng. trans., vol. ii. ch. xxi. ); Bacher, <hi rend="italic">Agada der Babyl. Amoräer,</hi> p. 108, &amp;c. and 114-133. (I. A. )</p>
