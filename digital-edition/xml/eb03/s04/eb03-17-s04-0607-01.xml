an appellation aſſumed in the early periods of Grecian hiſtory by thoſe who devoted their time to the ſtudy of ſcience. This appellation appearing too arrogant to Pythagoras, he declined it, and wiſhed to be called <hi rend="italic">a philosopher ;</hi> declaring that, though he could not conſider himſelf as a wise man, he was indeed a lover of wiſdom. True wiſdom and modeſty are generally united. The example of Pythagoras was followed by every man of eminence ; while the name <hi rend="italic">Sophist</hi> was retained only by thoſe who with a pomp of words made a magnificent diſplay of wiſdom upon a very slight foundation of knowledge. Thoſe men taught an artificial ſtructure of language, and a falſe method of reaſoning, by which, in argument, the worſe might be made to appear the better reaſon (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Sophism).</hi> In Athens they were long held in high repute, and ſupported, not only by contributions from their pupils, but by a regular ſalary from the ſtate. They were among the bittereſt enemies of the illuſtrious Socrates, becauſe he embraced every opportunity of exposing to contempt and ridicule their vain pretenſions to ſuperior knowledge, and the pernicious influence of their doctrines upon the taſte and morals of the Athenian youth.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
