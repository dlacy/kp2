<p><span class="font0">nobles, chiefly of the Colonna clan, were left dead. This was a real catastrophe to them, and the aristocracy never&nbsp;again achieved the rule of the republic. But Rienzi’s head&nbsp;was turned by this sudden success. In great need of&nbsp;money, he began to play the tyrant by levying taxes and&nbsp;exacting instant obedience. The papal legate saw his&nbsp;opportunity and seized it, by threatening to bring a charge&nbsp;of heresy against the tribune. Rienzi was dismayed. He&nbsp;declared himself friendly to the pope and willing to respect&nbsp;his authority; and he even sought to conciliate the nobles.&nbsp;At this moment certain Neapolitan and Hungarian captains,&nbsp;after levying soldiers with the tribune’s consent, joined the&nbsp;nobles and broke out in revolt. On their proving victorious&nbsp;in a preliminary encounter with some of Rienzi’s guards,&nbsp;the tribune suddenly lost heart, resigned the power he had&nbsp;held for seven months, and took refuge with a few trusty&nbsp;adherents in Castle St Angelo, on the 15th December&nbsp;1347. Thence he presently fled to Naples, vainly hoping&nbsp;to find aid, and afterwards disappeared for some time&nbsp;from the scene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meanwhile the Romans remained tranquil, intent on making money by the jubilee ; but no sooner was this over&nbsp;than disorders broke out and the tyranny of the baronage&nbsp;recommenced. To remedy this state of things, application&nbsp;was made to the pope. He consulted with a committee&nbsp;of cardinals, who sought the advice of Petrarch, and the&nbsp;poet suggested a popular government, to the complete&nbsp;exclusion of the nobles, since these, he said, were strangers&nbsp;who ruined the city. The people had already elected the&nbsp;Thirteen, and now, encouraged by these counsels, on the&nbsp;26th December 1351 chose Giovanni Perrone as head of&nbsp;the republic. But the new leader was unable to withstand&nbsp;the hostilities of the nobles; and in September 1353&nbsp;Prancesco Baroncelli was elected tribune. He was a&nbsp;follower of Rienzi, had been his ambassador to Florence,&nbsp;and did little beyond imitating his mode of government&nbsp;and smoothing the way for his return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rienzi had spent two years in the Abruzzi, leading a life of mystic contemplation on Monte Maiella. Then, in&nbsp;1350, he had gone to Prague and endeavoured to convert&nbsp;to his ideas the yet uncrowned emperor Charles IV. When&nbsp;apparently on the point of success, he was sent under&nbsp;arrest to the new pope, Innocent VI. (1352-62), a man&nbsp;of great shrewdness and practical sense. On Rienzi’s&nbsp;arrival at Avignon it became evident that his popularity&nbsp;was still very great, and that it would be no easy task to&nbsp;dispose of him. The Romans were imploring his return ;&nbsp;Petrarch lauded him as a modern Gracchus or Scipio ; and&nbsp;the pope finally released him from confinement. Innocent&nbsp;had decided to send to Italy, in order to settle affairs and&nbsp;bring the state into subjection to the church, that valiant&nbsp;captain and skilled politician, Cardinal Albornoz. And,&nbsp;having no fear that the latter’s hand would be forced, he&nbsp;further decided that Rienzi should be sent to give him the&nbsp;support of his own popularity in Rome. In fact directly&nbsp;the pair arrived Baroncelli was overthrown, the supremacy of&nbsp;the senate granted to the pope, and the government confided&nbsp;to Albornoz, who, without concerning himself with Rienzi,&nbsp;nominated Guido Patrizi as senator. He then marched at&nbsp;the head of his troops against Giovanni, prefect of Vico,&nbsp;and forced him to render submission at Montefiascone on&nbsp;the 5th June 1354. With the same promptitude and&nbsp;skill he reduced Umbria and the Tuscan and Sabine&nbsp;districts, consented to leave the privileges of the cities&nbsp;intact in return for their recognition of the papal authority, and planted fortresses in suitable positions. In the&nbsp;meantime Rienzi’s popularity was increasing in Rome ;&nbsp;without either money or arms, the ex-tribune succeeded&nbsp;by his eloquence in winning over the two Provençal&nbsp;leaders, brothers of the famous free captain Fra Monreale;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and, seduced by his promises and hopes, they supplied him with funds. Then, profiting by his prestige, the&nbsp;apparent favour of the pope, and the sums received,&nbsp;he was able to collect a band of five hundred soldiers of&nbsp;mixed nationalities and returned towards Rome. On&nbsp;Monte Mario he was met by the cavallerotti. On&nbsp;the 1st August 1354 he entered the Castello gate, took&nbsp;possession of the government, named Monreale’s two&nbsp;brothers his captains, and sent them to lay siege to&nbsp;Palestrina, which was still the headquarters of the Colonna.&nbsp;But then money ran short, and he again lost his head.&nbsp;Inviting Fra Monreale to a banquet, he put him to death&nbsp;for the sake of his wealth, and kept the two brothers&nbsp;in confinement. This act excited general indignation.&nbsp;And when, after his ill-gotten gains were spent, he again&nbsp;recurred to violence to fill his purse, the public discontent&nbsp;was vented in a sudden revolt on the 8th October. The&nbsp;people stormed the Capitol with cries of “ Death to the&nbsp;traitor.” Rienzi presented himself at a window waving&nbsp;the flag of Rome. But the charm was finally broken.&nbsp;Missiles were hurled at him ; the palace was fired. He hid&nbsp;himself in the courtyard, shaved his beard, and, disguised&nbsp;as a shepherd with a cloth over his head, slipped into the&nbsp;crowd and joined in their cries against himself. Being&nbsp;recognized, however, by the golden bracelets he had forgotten to remove, he was instantly stabbed. For two days&nbsp;his corpse was left exposed to the insults of the mob, and&nbsp;was then burned. Such was the wretched end of the man&nbsp;who, at one moment, seemed destined to fill the world&nbsp;with his name as the regenerator of Rome and of Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In all the Italian cities the overthrow of the aristocracy had led to military impotence and pressing danger of tyranny. The same thing had happened in Rome when&nbsp;the nobility, weakened by the absence of church and&nbsp;empire, received its death blow from Rienzi. But, whereas elsewhere tyrants were gradually arising in the citizen&nbsp;class, Rome was always in danger of oppression by the&nbsp;pope. Nor was any aid available from the empire, which&nbsp;had never recovered from its abasement under Louis the&nbsp;Bavarian. In fact, when Charles of Luxembourg came to&nbsp;Rome to be crowned, he was obliged to promise the pope&nbsp;that he would not enter the city. On Easter day 1355&nbsp;he received the crown, and departed, after counselling the&nbsp;Romans to obey the pope. And the pontiffs had greater&nbsp;need than ever of an established kingdom. Their position&nbsp;in France was much endangered by that country’s disorder.&nbsp;New states were being formed on all sides ; the mediæval&nbsp;unity was shattered ; and the shrunken spiritual authority&nbsp;of the church increased her need of material strength. As&nbsp;Italian affairs stood, it would be easy for the popes to&nbsp;found a kingdom, but their presence was required in Rome&nbsp;before it could be firmly established. The blood-stained&nbsp;sword of Albornoz had prepared the way before them.&nbsp;In 1355-56 he vanquished the lords or tyrants of Rimini,&nbsp;Fano, Fossombrone, Pesaro, Urbino, and other cities.&nbsp;And all these places had been so rudely oppressed that&nbsp;the cardinal was often hailed as a liberator after subduing&nbsp;their masters by fire , and sword. But everywhere he&nbsp;had been obliged to leave existing Governments and&nbsp;rulers </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in statu quo</span><span class="font0"> after exacting their oaths of fealty.&nbsp;Thus the state was still dissevered, and it was impossible&nbsp;to bind it together with the pope at Avignon and Rome&nbsp;a republic. Bologna was still independent, Ordelaffi still&nbsp;lord of Forli; Cesena and other cities were still rebellious ; and the Campagna was still in the hands of the&nbsp;barons. Some places were ruled by rectors nominated&nbsp;by the pope ; at Montefiascone there was an ecclesiastical rector, with a bench of judges, and a captain&nbsp;commanding a mixed band of adventurers. Rome had&nbsp;submitted to the haughty cardinal, but hated him</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
