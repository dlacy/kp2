<p><span class="font0">Rome three legates, who, on the 2lst of the month, concluded an agreement with the parliament. The people&nbsp;gave up the gates, the fortresses, and the Trastevere, and&nbsp;promised that if the pope returned to Rome he should&nbsp;have the same powers which had been granted to Urban V.&nbsp;But, on his side, he must pledge himself to maintain the&nbsp;executores, their council, the Three of War, and allow&nbsp;the Romans the right of reforming the banderesi, who&nbsp;would then swear fealty to him. The terms of this peace&nbsp;and the pope’s epistles clearly prove that the two councils&nbsp;still exercised their functions, that the banderesi were still&nbsp;the virtual heads of the Government, and that their suppression was not contemplated. In fact, when the pope&nbsp;made his entry on the 17th January 1377 accompanied by&nbsp;two thousand armed men, he perceived that there was&nbsp;much public agitation, that the Romans did not intend to&nbsp;fulfil their agreement, and that the Government of the&nbsp;banderesi went on as before. Accordingly, after naming&nbsp;Gomez Albornoz, a nephew of the deceased cardinal, to&nbsp;the office of senator, he retired to Anagni, and remained&nbsp;there until November 1377. The Romans presently waited&nbsp;on him with conciliating offers, and begged him to negotiate&nbsp;a peace for them with the prefect of Vico. In fact the&nbsp;treaty was concluded at Anagni in October, and on the&nbsp;IOth November confirmed in Rome by the general council.&nbsp;The meeting was held in the great hall of the Capitol,&nbsp;“ ubi consilia generalia urbis fieri soient,” in the presence&nbsp;of all the members of the republican Government. But&nbsp;the pope was enraged by the survival of this Government,&nbsp;and, being worn out by the persistent hostility of the&nbsp;Florentines, which reduced his power to a low ebb, had&nbsp;determined to make peace, when surprised by death on&nbsp;the 27th March 1378.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The next pope, Urban VI. (1378-89), a Neapolitan, was the spirit of discord incarnate. His election was not&nbsp;altogether regular: the French party among the cardinals&nbsp;was against him ; and the people were ripe for insurrection. But, regardless of all this, Urban threatened the&nbsp;cardinals in his first consistory, saying that church reform&nbsp;must begin with them ; and he used the same tone with&nbsp;the people, reproving them for failing to suppress the&nbsp;banderesi. In consequence of this the cardinals of the&nbsp;French party, assembling at Fondi, elected the antipope&nbsp;Clement VIL (1378-94) and started a long and painful&nbsp;schism in the church. Clement resided in Avignon, while&nbsp;Urban in Rome was engaged in opposing Queen Joanna I.&nbsp;of Naples and favouring Charles of Durazzo, who, on&nbsp;conquering the Neapolitan kingdom, was made gonfalonier&nbsp;of the church and senator of Rome, where he left a vicar&nbsp;as his deputy. Shortly afterwards the pope went to Naples,&nbsp;and made fierce war on the king. Then, after many&nbsp;adventures, during which he tortured and put to death&nbsp;several cardinals whom he suspected of hostile intentions,&nbsp;he returned to Rome, where the utmost disorder prevailed. The conservators and the banderesi were still at&nbsp;the head of the Government, and, the pope speedily falling&nbsp;out with them, a riot ensued, after which he excommunicated the banderesi. These at last made submission to&nbsp;him, and Urban VI. became master of Rome before his&nbsp;death in 1389. He was succeeded by Boniface IX.&nbsp;(1389-1404), another Neapolitan, but a man of greater&nbsp;shrewdness and capacity. His first act was to crown&nbsp;Ladislaus king of Naples, and secure the friendship and&nbsp;protection of this ambitious and powerful prince. In all&nbsp;the principal cities of the state he chose the reigning lords&nbsp;for his vicars. But he allowed Fermo, Ascoli, and Bologna&nbsp;the privilege of assuming their own vicariate for twenty-five years. And, as these different potentates and Governments had only to pay him an annual tribute, all parties&nbsp;were satisfied, and the pope was able to bestow at least an&nbsp;appearance of order and unity on his state. But fresh&nbsp;tumults soon arose, partly because the conservators and&nbsp;banderesi sought to govern on their own account, and&nbsp;especially because the pope seems for a time to have omitted&nbsp;naming the senator. Boniface was a prudent man ; he&nbsp;saw that events were turning in his favour, now that&nbsp;throughout Italy liberty was tottering to its fall, and bided&nbsp;his time. He was satisfied for the moment by obtaining&nbsp;a recognition of the immunities of the clergy, rendering&nbsp;them solely amenable to ecclesiastical tribunals, and thus&nbsp;distinguishing the powers of the church from those of the&nbsp;state in Rome. The republic also pledged itself neither&nbsp;to molest the prelates nor to levy fresh contributions on&nbsp;them towards repairing the walls, to aid in recovering&nbsp;the estates of the church in Tuscia, and to try to conciliate the baronage. This concordat, concluded with the&nbsp;Conservatorsandbanderesionthe Ilth September 1391,&nbsp;was also confirmed on the 5th March 1392 by the heads&nbsp;of the regions, together with a fresh treaty binding both&nbsp;parties to furnish a certain number of armed men to combat the prefect of Vico and the adherents of the antipope&nbsp;at Viterbo. With the exception of this city, Orchi, and&nbsp;Civita Vecchia, all other conquered territory was to belong&nbsp;to the republic. But the Romans soon discovered that&nbsp;they were playing into the hands of the pope, who kept&nbsp;everything for himself, without even paying the troops.&nbsp;Upon this a riot broke out; Boniface fled to Perugia in&nbsp;October 1392, and resolved to exact better terms when next&nbsp;recalled to Rome. Meanwhile the Romans subdued the&nbsp;prefect, captured Viterbo, and, being already repentant,&nbsp;handed it over to the pope and implored his return. He&nbsp;then proposed his own terms, which were approved, not&nbsp;only by the conservators, banderesi, and four councillors,&nbsp;but also by the special council and by the unanimous vote&nbsp;of a general assembly composed of the above-mentioned&nbsp;authorities, heads of regions, other officials, and a hundred&nbsp;citizens (8th August 1393). These terms prescribed that&nbsp;the pope was to elect the senator, and that, on his failing&nbsp;so to do, the conservators would carry on the government&nbsp;after swearing fealty to him. The senatorial function was&nbsp;to be neither controlled nor hampered by the banderesi.&nbsp;The immunities of the clergy were to be preserved, and&nbsp;all church property was to be respected by the magistrates.&nbsp;The expenses of the pope’s journey were to be paid, and&nbsp;he was to be escorted to Rome in state. Boniface tried to&nbsp;complete his work by abolishing the banderesi, the last&nbsp;bulwarks of freedom ; but the people, although weakened&nbsp;and weary, made efforts to preserve them, and, although&nbsp;their fall was inevitable, the struggle went on for some&nbsp;time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the spring of 1394 the banderesi provoked an insurrection in which the pope’s life was endangered ; it&nbsp;was only saved by the arrival of King Ladislaus, who&nbsp;came from Naples with a large force in the early autumn.&nbsp;But for the Neapolitan soldiery Boniface could not have&nbsp;withstood the long series of revolts that continually&nbsp;exposed him to fresh perils and the anxiety caused by&nbsp;the persistent schism .of the church. The death of Clement&nbsp;VII. in 1394 was followed by the election of another&nbsp;antipope, Benedict XIII. But a new jubilee was in&nbsp;prospect for the year 1400, and this was always an efficacious means of bending the will of the Romans. Depending upon this and the assistance of Ladislaus, Boniface&nbsp;not only demanded full powers to nominate senators&nbsp;(none having been recently elected), but insisted on the&nbsp;suppression of the banderesi. Both requests were granted ;&nbsp;but, directly Angelo Alaleoni was made senator, a conspiracy was hatched for the re-establishment of the&nbsp;banderesi. However, the pope felt sure of his strength ;&nbsp;the plot was discovered and the conspirators were beheaded</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
