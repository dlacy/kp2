<p><span class="font0">higher level of culture, but an idea or blend of ideas familiar to primitive thought. An important consequence of thus giving&nbsp;the study of primitive religion the wide scope of a comparative&nbsp;hierology is that magic is no longer divorced from religion, since&nbsp;the sacred will now be found to be coextensive with the magico-religious, that largely undifferentiated plasm out of which religion&nbsp;and magic slowly take separate shape as society comes more&nbsp;and more to contrast legitimate with illicit modes of dealing&nbsp;with the sacred. We may define, then, the religious object as&nbsp;the sacred, and the corresponding religious attitude as consisting in such manifestation of feeling, thought and action in&nbsp;regard to the sacred as is held to conduce to the welfare of the&nbsp;community or to that of individuals considered as members&nbsp;of the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aspects of the Nature of the Sacred.—</span><span class="font0">To exhibit the general character of the sacred as it exists for primitive religion it&nbsp;is simplest to take stock of various aspects recognized by&nbsp;primitive thought as expressed in language. If some, and&nbsp;not the least essential, of these aspects are quasi-negative,&nbsp;it must be remembered that negations—witness the Unseen,&nbsp;the Unknown, the Infinite of a more advanced theology—are&nbsp;well adapted to supply that mystery on which the religious&nbsp;consciousness feeds with the slight basis of conceptual support&nbsp;it needs, (i) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The sacred as the forbidden.</span><span class="font0"> The primitive&nbsp;notion that perhaps comes nearest to our “ sacred,” whilst it&nbsp;immediately underlies the meanings of the Latin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sacer</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sanctus,</span><span class="font0"> is that of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">taboo,</span><span class="font0"> a Polynesian term for which equivalents can be quoted from most savage vocabularies. The&nbsp;root idea seems to be that something is marked off as to be&nbsp;shunned, with the added hint of a mystic sanction or penalty&nbsp;enforcing the avoidance. Two derivative senses of a more&nbsp;positive import call for special notice. On the one hand,&nbsp;since that which is tabooed is held to punish the taboo-breaker&nbsp;by a sort of mystic infection, taboo comes to stand for uncleanness and sin. On the other hand, since the isolation of&nbsp;the sacred, even when originally conceived in the interest of&nbsp;the profane, may be interpreted as self-protection on the part&nbsp;of the sacred as against defiling contact, taboo takes on the&nbsp;connotation of ascetic virtue, purity, devotion, dignity and&nbsp;blessedness. Primary and secondary senses of the term between&nbsp;them cover so much ground that it is not surprising to find&nbsp;taboo used in Polynesia as a name for the whole system of&nbsp;religion, founded as it largely is on prohibitions and abstinences. (2) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The sacred as the mysterious.</span><span class="font0"> Another quasinegative notion of more restricted distribution is that of the&nbsp;mysterious or strange, as we have it expressed, for example, in&nbsp;the Siouan </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">wakan,</span><span class="font0"> though possihly this is a derivative meaning.&nbsp;Meanwhile, it is certain that what is strange, new or portentous is regularly treated by all savages as sacred. (3) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;sacred as the secret.</span><span class="font0"> The literal sense of the term </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">churinga,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">applied by the Central Australians to their sacred objects,&nbsp;and likewise used more abstractly to denote mystic power,&nbsp;as when a man is said to be “ full of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Churinga,&quot; </span><span class="font0"> is “ secret,”&nbsp;and is symptomatic of the esotericism that is a striking mark&nbsp;of Australian, and indeed of all primitive, religion, with its&nbsp;insistence on initiation, its exclusion of women, and its strictly&nbsp;enforced reticence concerning traditional lore and proceedings.&nbsp;(4) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The sacred as the potent.</span><span class="font0"> Passing on to positive conceptions&nbsp;of the sacred, perhaps the most fundamental is that which&nbsp;identifies the efficacy of sacredness with such mystic or magical&nbsp;power as is signified by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mana</span><span class="font0"> of the Pacific or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">orenda</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;the Hurons, terms for which analogies are forthcoming on all&nbsp;sides. Of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mana</span><span class="font0"> Dr R. H. Codrington in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Melanesians,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">119 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">n.,</span><span class="font0"> writes: “It essentially belongs to personal beings to originate it, though it may act through the medium of water,&nbsp;or a stone, or a bone. All Melanesian religion consists . . .&nbsp;in getting this </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mana</span><span class="font0"> for oneself, or getting it used for one’s&nbsp;benefit.” E. Tregear’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Maori-Polynesian Comparative Dictionary</span><span class="font0"> shows how the word and its derivatives are used to&nbsp;express thought, memory, emotion, desire, will—in short,&nbsp;psychic energy of all kinds. It also stands for the vehicle&nbsp;of the magician’s energy—the spell; which would seem likewise to be a meaning, perhaps the root-meaning, of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">orenda&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(cf. J. N. B. Hewitt, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">American Anthropologist,</span><span class="font0"> N.S., iv. 40).&nbsp;Whereas everything, perhaps, has some share of indwelling&nbsp;potency, whatever is sacred manifests this potency in an extraordinary degree, as typically the wonder-working leader of&nbsp;society, whose </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mana</span><span class="font0"> consists in his cunning and luck together.&nbsp;Altogether, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mana</span><span class="font0"> we have what is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">par excellence</span><span class="font0"> the primitive&nbsp;religious idea in its positive aspect, tahoo representing its&nbsp;negative side, since whatever has </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mana</span><span class="font0"> is taboo, and whatever is taboo has </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mana.</span><span class="font0"> (5) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The sacred as the animate.</span><span class="font0"> The&nbsp;term “ animism,” which embodies Tylor’s classical theory&nbsp;of primitive religion, is unfortunately somewhat ambiguous.&nbsp;If we take it strictly to mean the belief in ghosts or spirits&nbsp;having the “ vaporous materiality ” proper to the objects&nbsp;of dream or hallucination, it is certain that the agency of such&nbsp;phantasms is not the sole cause to which all mystic happenings&nbsp;are referred (though ghosts and spirits are everywhere believed&nbsp;in, and appear to be endowed with greater predominance&nbsp;as religious synthesis advances amongst primitive peoples).&nbsp;Thus there is good evidence to show that many of the early&nbsp;gods, notahly those that are held to be especially well disposed&nbsp;to man, are conceived rather in the shape of magnified nonnatural men dwelling somewhere apart, such as the Mungan-ngaur of the Kurnai of S.E. Australia (cf. A. Lang, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Making of Religion<sup>2</sup>, x.</span><span class="font0"> sqq.). Such anthropomorphism is&nbsp;with difficulty reduced to the Tylorian animism. The term,&nbsp;however, will have to be used still more vaguely, if it is to&nbsp;cover all attribution of personality, will or vitality. This&nbsp;can be more simply brought under the notion of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mana.</span><span class="font0"> Meanwhile, since quasi-mechanical means are freely resorted to&nbsp;in dealing with the sacred, as when a Maori chief snuffs up&nbsp;the sanctity his fingers have acquired by touching his own&nbsp;sacred head that he may restore the virtue to the part whence&nbsp;it was taken (R. Taylor, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Te Ika a Maui,</span><span class="font0"> 165), or when uncleanness is removed as if it were a physical secretion by washing,&nbsp;wiping and so forth, it is hard to say whether what we should&nbsp;now call a “ material ” nature is not ascribed to the sacred,&nbsp;more especially when its transmissihility after the manner of&nbsp;a contagion is the trait that holds the attention. It is possible,&nbsp;however, that the savage always distinguishes in a dim way&nbsp;between the material medium and the indwelling principle&nbsp;of vital energy, examples of a pure fetishism, in the sense of&nbsp;the cult of the purely material, recognized as such, being hard&nbsp;to find. (6) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The sacred as the ancient.</span><span class="font0"> The prominence of&nbsp;the notion of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Alcheringa</span><span class="font0"> “ dreamtime,” or sacred past,&nbsp;in Central Australian religion illustrates the essential connexion perceived by the savage to lie between the sacred and&nbsp;the traditional. Ritualistic conservatism may be instanced as&nbsp;a practical outcome of this feeling. Another development is&nbsp;ancestor-worship, the organized cult of ancestors marking,&nbsp;however, a certain stage of advance beyond the very primitive,&nbsp;though the dead are always sacred and have </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mana</span><span class="font0"> which the&nbsp;living may exploit for their own advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Activity of the Sacred.—</span><span class="font0">The foregoing views of the sacred, though starting from distinct conceptions, converge in a single&nbsp;complex notion, as may be seen from the many-sided sense&nbsp;borne by such a term as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">wakan,</span><span class="font0"> which may stand not only for&nbsp;“ mystery,” but also for “ power, sacred, ancient, grandeur,&nbsp;animate, immortal ” (W J McGee, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">15th Report of U. S. Bureau&nbsp;of Ethnology,</span><span class="font0"> 182). The reason for this convergence is that,&nbsp;whereas there is found great difficulty in characterizing the&nbsp;elusive nature of the sacred, its mode of manifesting itself is&nbsp;recognized to be much the same in all its phases. Uniform&nbsp;characteristics are the fecundity, ambiguity, relativity and&nbsp;transmissihility of its activity, (r) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fecundity.</span><span class="font0"> The mystic&nbsp;potency of the sabred is no fixed quantity, but is big with&nbsp;possibilities of all sorts. The same sacred person, object, act,&nbsp;will suffice for a variety of purposes. Even where a piece of&nbsp;sympathetic magic appears to promise definite results, or when&nbsp;a departmental god is recognized, there would seem to be room&nbsp;left for a more or less indefinite expectancy. It must be re-membered that the meaning of a rite is for the most part obscure</span></p>
