an ancient name for the northern parts of Aſia, now known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Tartary;</hi> alſo for ſome of the north-eaſtern parts of Europe.</p><p>This vaſt territory, which extends itſelf from the Iſter or Danube, the boundary of the Celts, that is, from about the 25th to almoſt the 110th degree of eaſt longitude, was divided into Scythia in Europe and Scythia in Aſia, including, however, the two Sarmatias; or, as they are called by the Greeks, <hi rend="italic">Sauromatias,</hi> now the Circaſſian Tartary, which lay between and ſevered the two Scythias from each other. Sauromatia was alſo diſtinguiſhed into European and Aſiatic; and was divided from the European Scythia by the river Don or Tanais, which falls into the Palus Meotis; and from the Aſiatic by the Rha, now Volga, which empties itſelf into the Caſpian ſea.</p><p>1. The Aſiatic Scythia comprehended, in general, great Tartary, and Ruſſia in Aſia; and, in particular, the Scythia beyond or without Imaus, contained the regions of Bogdoi or Oſtiacoi, and Tanguti. That within, or on this ſide Imaus, had I urkeſtan and Mυngal, the Uſheck or Zagatai, Kalmuc and Nagaian Tartars; beſides Siberia, the land of the Samoiedes, and Nova Zembla. Theſe three laſt not being ſo ſoon inhabited as the former, as may be reaſonably ſuppoſed, were wholly unknown to the ancients; and the former were peopled by the Bactrians, Sogdians, Gandari. Sacks, and Maffagetes. As for Sarmatia, it contained Albania, Iberia, and Colchis; which makes now the Circaſſian Tartary, and the province of Georgia.</p><p>2. Scythia in Europe reached (towards the ſouth- weſt) to the Po and the Alps, by which it was divided from Celto-Gallia. It was bounded on the ſouth by the Iſter or Danube and the Euxine ſea. Its northern limits have been ſuppoſed to ſtretch to the ſpring-heads of the Boriſthenes or Nieper, and the Rha or Volga, and ſo to that of the Tanais—The ancients divided this country into Scythia Arimaſpaea, which lay eaſtward, joining to Scythia in Aſia; and Sarmatia Europeana on the weft. In Scythia, properly ſo called, were the Arimaſpæi on the north; the Getae or Dacians along the Danube, on the ſouth; and the Neuri between theſe two. So that it contained the European Ruſſia or Muſeovy, and the Leſſer Crim Tartary eaſtward; and, on the weſt, Lithuania, Poland, part of Hungary; Tranſilvania, Walachia, Bulgaria, and Moldavia. Sarmatia is ſuppoſed to have reached northward to that part of Swedeland called <hi rend="italic">Feningia,</hi> now <hi rend="italic">Finland;</hi> in which they placed the Games, Panoti, and Hippopodes. This part they divided from northern Germany, now the weſt part of Sweden and Norway, by the <hi rend="italic">Mare Sarmaticum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Scythicum,</hi> which they ſuppoſed ran up into the northern ocean, and, dividing Lapland into two parts, formed the weſtern part of Sweden, with Norway, into one iſland, and Finland into another; ſuppoſing this alſo to be cut off from the continent by the gulph of that name.</p><p>Although the ancient Scythians were celebrated as a warlike people, yet their hiſtory is too uncertain and obſcure to enable us to give any detail which would not prove equally tireſome and unintereſting to the reader. Mr Pinkerton, in a diſſertation on their origin, endeavours to prove that they were the moſt ancient of nations; and he aſſigns for the place of their firſt habitation the country known by the name of Perſia. From Perſia, he thinks, they proceeded in numerous hordes weſtward, ſurrounded the Euxine, peopled Germany, Italy, Gaul, the countries bordering on the Baltic, with part of Britain and Ireland. That the Scythians were of Aſi-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0195.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0189"/>
atic origin cannot, we think, be queſtioned; and as Perſia was peopled at a very early period, it may not improbably have been their parent country: but when our author contends that their empire had ſubſiſted for more than 1500 years before Ninus the founder of the Aſſyrian monarchy, and that it extended from Egypt to the Ganges, and from the Perſian gulf and Indian ſea to the Caſpian, we cannot help thinking that his prejudices againſt the Celts, and his deſire to do honour to his favourite Goths, have made him advance a paradox inconſiſtent with the moſt authentic records of antiquity. His diſſertation however is ingenious, and replete with a variety of curious learning.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Scythian</hi> <hi rend="italic">Lamb,</hi> in natural hiſtory.
