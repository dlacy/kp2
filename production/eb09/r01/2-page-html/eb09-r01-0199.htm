<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">new conception of human life, the new interest in the material universe, the new method of education, and the&nbsp;new manners, which we have seen to be inseparable from&nbsp;Italian humanism. Under these forms of intellectual&nbsp;eulightenment and polite culture the renascence of the&nbsp;human spirit had appeared in Italy, where it was more&nbsp;than elsewhere connected with the study of classical&nbsp;antiquity. But that audacious exploratory energy which&nbsp;formed the motive force of the Renaissance as distinguished&nbsp;from the Revival of Learning took, as we shall see, very&nbsp;different directions in the several nations who now were&nbsp;sending the flower of their youth to study at the feet of&nbsp;Italian rhetoricians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Renaissance ran its course in Italy with strange indifference to consequences. The five great powers, held&nbsp;in equilibrium by Lorenzo de’ Medici, dreamed that the&nbsp;peninsula could be maintained </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in statu quo</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> by diplomacy.&nbsp;The church saw no danger in encouraging a pseudopagan ideal of life, violating its own principle of existence&nbsp;by assuming the policy of an aggrandizing secular state,&nbsp;and outraging Christendom openly by its acts and&nbsp;utterances. Society at large was hardly aware that an&nbsp;intellectual force of stupendous magnitude and incalculable&nbsp;explosive power had been created by the new learning.&nbsp;Why should not established institutions proceed upon the&nbsp;customary and convenient methods of routine, while the&nbsp;delights of existence were augmented, manners polished,&nbsp;arts developed, and a golden age of epicurean ease made&nbsp;decent by a state religion which no one cared to break&nbsp;with because no one was left to regard it seriously ? This&nbsp;was the attitude of the Italians when the Renaissance,&nbsp;which they had initiated as a thing of beauty, began to&nbsp;operate as a thing of power beyond the Alps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Germany was already provided with universities, seven of which had been founded between 1348 and 1409.&nbsp;In these haunts of learning the new studies took root&nbsp;' after the year 1440, chiefly through the influence of travelling professors, Peter Luder and Samuel Karoch.&nbsp;German scholars made their way to Lombard and Tuscan&nbsp;lecture-rooms, bringing back the methods of the humanists.&nbsp;Greek, Latin, and Hebrew erudition soon found itself at&nbsp;home on Teutonic soil. Like Italian men of letters,&nbsp;these pioneers of humanism gave a classic turn to their&nbsp;patronymics; unfamiliar names, Crotus Rubeanus and&nbsp;Pierius Grsecus, Capnion and Lupambulus Ganymedes,&nbsp;GScolampadius and Melanchthon, resounded on the Rhine.&nbsp;A few of the German princes, among whom Maximilian,&nbsp;the prince cardinal Albert of Mainz, Frederick the Wise&nbsp;of Saxony, and Eberhard of Wiirtemberg deserve mention,&nbsp;exercised a not insignificant influence on letters by the&nbsp;foundation of new universities and the patronage of&nbsp;learned men. The cities of Strasburg, Nuremberg, Augsburg, Basel, became centres of learned coteries, which&nbsp;gathered round scholars like Wimpheling, Brant, Peutinger,&nbsp;Schedel, and Pirckheimer, artists like Dürer and Holbein,&nbsp;printers of the eminence of Froben. Academies in&nbsp;imitation of Italian institutions came into existence, the&nbsp;two most conspicuous, named after the Rhine and Danube,&nbsp;holding their headquarters respectively at Heidelberg and&nbsp;Vienna. Crowned poets, of whom the most eminent was&nbsp;Conrad Geltes Protucius (Pickel!), emulated the fame of&nbsp;Politian and Pontano. Yet, though the Renaissance was&nbsp;thus widely communicated to the centres of German&nbsp;intelligence, it displayed a different character from that&nbsp;which it assumed in Italy. Gothic art, which was indigenous in Germany, yielded but little to southern influences. Such work as that of Dürer, Yischer, Cranach,&nbsp;Schöngauer, Holbein, consummate as it was in technical&nbsp;excellence, did not assume Italian forms of loveliness, did&nbsp;not display the paganism of the Latin races. The modi</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">fication of Gothic architecture by pseudo-Roman elements of style was incomplete. What Germany afterwards took&nbsp;of the Palladian manner was destined to reach it on a&nbsp;circuitous route from France. In like manner the new&nbsp;learning failed to penetrate all classes of society with the&nbsp;rapidity of its expansion in Italy, nor was the new ideal&nbsp;of life and customs so easily substituted for the mediaeval.&nbsp;The German aristocracy, as AEneas Sylvius had noticed,&nbsp;remained for the most part barbarous, addicted to&nbsp;gross pleasures, contemptuous of culture. The German&nbsp;dialects were too rough to receive that artistic elaboration under antique influences which had been so facile&nbsp;in Tuscany. The doctors of the universities were too&nbsp;wedded to their antiquated manuals and methods, too&nbsp;satisfied with dulness,, too proud of titles and diplomas,&nbsp;too anxious to preserve ecclesiastical discipline and to&nbsp;repress mental activity, for a genial spirit of humanism to spread freely. Not in Cologne or Tübingen&nbsp;but in Padua and Florence did the German pioneers of&nbsp;the Renaissance acquire their sense of liberal studies.&nbsp;And when they returned home they found themselves&nbsp;encumbered with stupidities, jealousies, and rancours.&nbsp;Moreover, the temper of these more enlightened men&nbsp;was itself opposed to Italian indifference and immorality ; it was pugnacious and polemical, eager to beat&nbsp;down the arrogance of monks and theologians rather&nbsp;than to pursue an ideal of sesthetical self-culture. To a&nbsp;student of the origins of German humanism it is clear&nbsp;that something very different from the Renaissance of&nbsp;Lorenzo de’ Medici and Leo X. was in preparation from&nbsp;the first upon Teutonic soil. Far less plastic and form-loving than the Italian, the German intelligence was&nbsp;more penetrative, earnest, disputative, occupied with substantial problems. Starting with theological criticism,&nbsp;proceeding to the stage of solid studies in the three&nbsp;learned languages, German humanism occupied the attention of a widely scattered sect of erudite scholars; but it&nbsp;did not arouse the interest of the whole nation until it was&nbsp;forced into a violently militant attitude by Pfefferkorn’s&nbsp;attack on Reuchlin. That attempt to extinguish honest&nbsp;thought prepared the Reformation; and humanism after&nbsp;1518 was absorbed in politico-religious warfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The point of contact between humanism and the Reformation in Germany has to be insisted on ; for it is just here that the relation of the Reformation to the Renaissance in&nbsp;general makes itself apparent. As the Renaissance had&nbsp;its precursory movements in the medieval period, so the&nbsp;German Reformation was preceded by Wickliffe and Huss,&nbsp;by the discontents of the Great Schism, and by the&nbsp;councils of Constance and Basel. These two main streams&nbsp;of modern progress had been proceeding upon different&nbsp;tracks to diverse issues, but they touched in the studies&nbsp;stimulated by the Revival, and they had a common origin&nbsp;in the struggle of the spirit after self-emancipation.&nbsp;Johann Reuchlin, who entered the lecture-room of Argyro-poulos at Rome in 1482, Erasmus of Rotterdam, who&nbsp;once dwelt at Venice as the house guest of the Aldi, applied&nbsp;their critical knowledge of Hebrew and of Greek to the&nbsp;elucidation and diffusion of the Bible. To the Germans,&nbsp;as to all nations of that epoch, the Bible came as a new&nbsp;book, because they now read it for the first time with&nbsp;eyes opened by humanism. The touch of the new spirit&nbsp;which had evolved literature, art, and culture in Italy&nbsp;sufficed in Germany to recreate Christianity. This new&nbsp;spirit in Italy emancipated human intelligence by the&nbsp;classics ; in Germany it emancipated the human conscience&nbsp;by the Bible. The indignation excited by Leo X.’s sale&nbsp;of indulgences, the moral rage stirred in Northern hearts&nbsp;by papal abominations in Rome, were external causes&nbsp;which precipitated the schism between Teutonic and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
