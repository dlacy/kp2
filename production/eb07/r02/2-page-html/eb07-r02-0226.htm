<p><span class="font0">quarto. It was elegantly printed by John Maccreery, who, at his suggestion, had recently established a press in Liverpool. The success of this publication exceeded the most&nbsp;sanguine expectations which the author could have ventured&nbsp;to cherish. From the periodical critics he obtained ample&nbsp;praise. He received letters of warm commendation from&nbsp;men of rank and men of letters, with several of whom he&nbsp;had no previous acquaintance or correspondence. One of&nbsp;these was the eccentric earl of Bristol and bishop of Derry,&nbsp;who was then residing in Rome. He first applied to Mr&nbsp;Cadell,the bookseller, in order to ascertain the author’s profession, resources in life, and what present of books, pictures,&nbsp;or statues, might be most acceptable to him. Dr Parr’s&nbsp;fervent zeal in the cause of literature likewise prompted&nbsp;him to seek the correspondence of the elegant biographer.&nbsp;The first letter which he addressed to him contains the&nbsp;subsequent passage : “ You will pardon my zeal, Sir, and&nbsp;you may confide in my sincerity, when I declare to you&nbsp;that the contents of your book far surpassed my expectation, and amply rewarded the attention with which I perused&nbsp;it. You have thrown the clearest and fullest light upon a&nbsp;period most interesting to every scholar. You have produced much that was unknown, and to that which was known&nbsp;vou have given perspicuity, order, and grace. You have&nbsp;shown the greatest diligence in your researches, and the&nbsp;purest taste in your selection ; and upon the characters&nbsp;and events which passed in review before your inquisitive&nbsp;and discriminating mind, you have united sagacity of observation with correctness, elegance, and vigour of style.”&nbsp;The correspondence thus begun led to an intimate friendship. The work obtained a very high compliment from&nbsp;another individual, from whom it was less to be expected.&nbsp;Mathias so completely overcame the violence of his political animosities, as to bestow this eulogium on the author :</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But hark ! what solemn strains from Amo’s vales Breathe raptures wafted on the Tuscan gales !</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Lorenzo rears again his awful head,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And feels his ancient glories round him spread ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Muses starting from their trance revive,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And at their Roscoe's bidding wake and live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To these lines, in his Pursuits of Literature, he has subjoined a long note, which contains the subsequent passage : “ I have not terms sufficient to express my admiration of&nbsp;his genius and erudition, or my gratitude for the amusement and information I have received.” An intercourse of&nbsp;civilities with the anonymous writer was a very natural result ; and he was afterwards extolled by Mathias in Italian&nbsp;verse as well as prose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first edition of this work was printed at thc expense of the author ; but soon after its appearance, Cadell and&nbsp;Davies offered him no less a sum than L.1200 for the copyright. Of this liberal offer he did not hesitate to accept ;&nbsp;and little doubt can be entertained that the booksellers&nbsp;found it a very advantageous transaction. The fourth edition, in three volumes octavo, was printed in 1800. In&nbsp;other countries, the success of this book was equally brilliant. Three editions were speedily circulated in America.&nbsp;The work, translated into German by Sprengel, was published at Berlin in 1797. In 1799 a French translation, by&nbsp;François Thurot, was published at Paris. During the same&nbsp;year, an Italian version, by the Cavaliero Gaetano Mechi-rini, made its appearance at Pisa, in four volumes octavo. It&nbsp;was undertaken at the suggestion of the elegant Fabroni, who&nbsp;had himself published a Latin life of Lorenzo, which he intended to translate into his native language ; but he was so&nbsp;much delighted with Roscoe’s work, that he abandoned bis&nbsp;design, and recommended the other task to Mechirini. In&nbsp;the course of the ensuing year, he addressed a very gratifying letter to the author. Similar letters were addressed&nbsp;to him by Bandini, the learned keeper of the Laurentian</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Library in Florence, and by the Abate Andres, a Spanish Jesuit, resident in Italy, and deeply skilled in Italian literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For the avocation of an attorney Mr Roscoe never had any hearty relish, and he finally relinquished it in the year&nbsp;17^96. With his last partner, Mr Lace, he made an arrangement which secured him some interest in the business ;&nbsp;and during the following year he entered himself at Gray’s&nbsp;Inn, with the view of being called to the bar. He kept&nbsp;Hilary term, but made no further progress in this new career, although, according to the opinion of his son, he possessed qualities which must in all probability have rendered his success certain. In conjunction with Mr Thomas&nbsp;Wakefield, he had in 1793 obtained a lease of an extensive&nbsp;tract of peat-moss in the vicinity of Manchester ; and from&nbsp;the draining and improvement of this land he anticipated an&nbsp;ample return. In 1799 he purchased one half of the Allerton estate, a valuable property situate about six miles from&nbsp;Liverpool. Allerton Hall, which belonged to his portion,&nbsp;was originally built in the reign of James the First ; but&nbsp;that structure had been partly taken down about the middle&nbsp;of last century, and a handsome stone-edifice had been&nbsp;erected in its place. The house was surrounded by gardens disposed in the old English taste, and was environed&nbsp;on every side with ample woods. Here it was his wish to&nbsp;spend the remainder of his days in studious retirement ;&nbsp;but within the brief period of twelve months, he found himself deeply involved in the labours and anxieties of commercial life. The family of his intimate friend Mr Clarke,&nbsp;which had long been connected with an extensive banking-house at Liverpool, was at the close of the year 1799 placed&nbsp;in circumstances of considerable difficulty. “ The aid of&nbsp;Mr Roscoe, as a confidential adviser, was requested by the&nbsp;partners, and he did not hesitate to lend his best assistance.&nbsp;Chiefly through his instrumentality, the difficulties which&nbsp;existed between the Liverpool bank and their London correspondents were removed, and it was the anxious wish of&nbsp;the latter, as well as the former, that Mr Roscoe should&nbsp;render his labours complete, by becoming an active partner&nbsp;in the banking-house at Liverpool.” It was rather his&nbsp;friendship for tile family of Clarke, than any motive more&nbsp;personal to himself, that induced him to embrace this offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By great and unremitting exertions, he brought the affairs of the house into a better train of management ; and towards the close of the year 1800, he could again command some portion of leisure for his favourite pursuits. He&nbsp;had previously published “ The Nurse, a poem translated&nbsp;from the Italian of Luigi Tansillo.” This elegant versioc&nbsp;was favourably received, and it reached a third edition in&nbsp;1804. But he had for some time contemplated a more&nbsp;magnificent undertaking, a life of Leo the Tenth ; and on&nbsp;receiving, through the kindness of Lord Holland, some important and unpublished materials from Florence, he reverted to it with new ardour. “ The History of the Life&nbsp;and Pontificate of Leo X.” was published in four volumes&nbsp;quarto in the year 1805. It had been in the press upwards&nbsp;of two years. For one half of the copyright Cadell and&nbsp;Davies paid the sum of L.2000. This work, notwithstanding its great and varied merit, experienced a less favourable&nbsp;reception than its precursor. The author’s brilliant success&nbsp;appears to have excited no small degree of spleen in some&nbsp;of the periodical critics, who accordingly treated him with&nbsp;little candour or courtesy. This production however, relating to a most important era in the civil, ecclesiastical,&nbsp;and literary history of Europe, was highly estimated by&nbsp;many very competent judges. The history of the revival&nbsp;of learning was itself a very extensive, as τvell as a very arduous field for disquisition. The history of the fine arts&nbsp;required knowledge and taste of a different denomination.&nbsp;The history of the reformation of religion involved many&nbsp;questions of subtle disputation, as well as many topics of</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
