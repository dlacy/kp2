            <p>SS, ſ, or s, the 18th letter and 14th conſonant of our alphabet; the found of which is
                formed by driving the breath through a narrow paſſage between the palate and the
                tongue elevated near it, together with a motion of the lower jaw and teeth towards
                the upper, the lips being a little way open; with ſuch a configuration of every part
                of the mouth and larynx, as renders the voice ſomewhat ſibilous and hiſſing. Its
                found, however, varies; being ſtrong in ſome words, as this, thus, &amp;c. and ſoft
                in words which have a final e, as muſe, wiſe, &amp;c. It is generally doubled at the
                end of words, whereby they become hard and harſh, as in kiſs, loss, &amp;c. In ſome
                words it is ſilent, as iſle, iſland, viſcount, &amp;c. In writing or printing, the
                long character ſ is generally uſed at the beginning and middle of words, but the
                ſhort s at the end.</p>

                royal ſociety. In medicinal preſcriptions, S. A. ſignifies <hi rend="italic"
                    >ſecundum artem,</hi> i. e. according to the rules of art: And in the notes of
                the ancients, S ſtands for <hi rend="italic">Sextus;</hi></p>
            <p>S. P. for <hi rend="italic">Spurius;</hi> S. C. <hi rend="italic">for ſenatus
                    conſultum;</hi> S. P. Q. R. <hi rend="italic">for ſenatus populuſque
                    Romanus;</hi> S. S. S. <hi rend="italic">for ſtratum ſu- per ſtratum,</hi> i. e.
                one layer above another alternately; S. V. B. E. E. Q. V. for <hi rend="italic">ſi
                    vales bene eſt, ego quoque valeo, </hi>a form uſed in Cicero’s time, in the
                beginning of letters. Uſed as a numeral, S anciently denoted ſeven; in the Italian
                inuſic, S ſignifies <hi rend="italic">ſolo:</hi> And in books of navigation, S.
                ſtands for ſouth; S. E. for ſouth-eaſt; S. W. for ſouth-weſt; S. S. E. for ſouth
                ſouth-eaſt; S. S. W for ſouth ſouth-weſt &amp;c.</p>
