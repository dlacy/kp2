in the manufactories, the ſame with ſine-drawing. It confiſts in ſewing two pieces of cloth edge to edge, without doubling them, ſo that the ſeam ſcaree appears ; and hence it is denominated <hi rend="italic">fine-drawing.</hi> lt is a French word meaning the ſame thing, and is derived from the Latin <hi rend="italic">reirahere,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">re, in,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">trahere,</hi> becauſe the ſeam is drawn in or covered. WC are told*, that in the Eaſt Indies, if a piece of fine muſiin be torn and afterwards mended by the ſine-drawers, it will be impoſſible to diſcover where the rent was. Irf this country the dexterity of the ſine-drawers is not ſo great as that of thoſe in the eaſt ; but it is ſtill ſuch as to enable them to defraud the revenue, by fewing a head or ſlip of Engliſh cloth on a piece of Dutch, Spaniſh, or other foreign cloth : or a ſiip of foreign cloth on a piece of Engliſh, ſo as to paſs the whole as of a piece ; and by that means avoid the duties, penalties, &amp;c. The trick was ſirſt diſcovered in France by M. Savary.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Renterino, in tapeſtry, is the working new warp into a piece of damaged tapeſtry, whether eaten by the rats or otherwife deſtroyed, and on this warp to reſtore the ancient pattern or deſign. The warp is to be of woollen, not linen. Among the titles of the French tapeſtry makers is included that of renterers. Fine-drawing is particularly uſed for a rent or hole, which happens in dreſſing or preparing a piece of cloth art-fully ſewed up or mended with lilk. All fine-drawings are reckoned defects or blemiſhes ; and ſhould be allow-</hi> ¢d for in the price of the piece.</p>
