<p><span class="font1">Island are citizens of the state. Under an act of 1724 the suffrage was restricted to adult males who possessed a freehold&nbsp;of the value of $134 (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History).</span><span class="font1"> So far as state and national&nbsp;elections are concerned, the privilege was extended to native&nbsp;non-freeholders by the constitution of 1842, to naturalized&nbsp;foreigners who had served in the -Civil War by an amendment&nbsp;of the 7th of April 1886, and to all adult male citizens by the&nbsp;amendment of the 4th of April 1888. A curious survival of&nbsp;the old system exists in the provision that only those who pay&nbsp;taxes on $134 worth of property may vote for members of city&nbsp;councils or on propositions to levy taxes or to expend public&nbsp;money. The working men are thus almost entirely excluded&nbsp;from participating in the government of the large factory&nbsp;towns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Amendments to the constitution must be passed by both houses of the General Assembly at two consecutive sessions,&nbsp;and must then be ratified by three-fifths of the electors of the&nbsp;state present and voting thereon in town and ward meetings.&nbsp;Fifteen amendments have thus been added to the constitution&nbsp;of 1842. An amendment of the 7th of April 1886 forbade&nbsp;the manufacture and sale of intoxicating beverages, but it was&nbsp;badly enforced and was repealed by a subsequent amendment&nbsp;of the 20th of June 1889.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The powers of the governor are unusually small. Until 1909, when a constitutional amendment was adopted, he had no power&nbsp;of veto, and his very limited nominal powers of appointment and&nbsp;removal are controlled by a rotten-borough Senate. The other&nbsp;administrative officers </span><span class="font2">are </span><span class="font3">a secretary </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font3">state, an attorney-general,&nbsp;an auditor, a treasurer, a commissioner of public schools, a railroad&nbsp;commissioner, and a factory inspector, and various boards and&nbsp;commissions, such as the board of education, the board of agriculture, the board of health, and the commissioners of inland&nbsp;fisheries, commissioners of harbours and commissioners of pilots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The legislative power is vested in the General Assembly,@@<sup>1</sup> which consists of a Senate made up of the lieutenant-governor and of one&nbsp;senator from each of the thirty-eight cities and townships in the&nbsp;state, and a House of Representatives of one hundred members,&nbsp;apportioned according to population, but with the proviso that each&nbsp;town or city shall have at least one member and none shall have&nbsp;more than one-fourth of the total (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">History).</span><span class="font3"> Members of the&nbsp;legislature and all state officials are elected annually in November.&nbsp;A majority vote was formerly required, but since the adoption&nbsp;of the tenth amendment (November 28, 1893) a plurality vote&nbsp;has elected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the head of the judicial system is the supreme court (1747), divided since 1893 into an appellate division and a common pleas&nbsp;division, with final revisory and appellate jurisdiction upon all&nbsp;questions of law and equity. Below this are the twelve district&nbsp;courts, the town councils, probate courts in the larger towns, and&nbsp;justices of the peace. The seven judges of the supreme court and&nbsp;the district judges are elected by the General Assembly, the former&nbsp;during good behaviour, the latter for terms of three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The town (or township) is the unit of local government, the county being recognized only for judicial purposes and to a certain&nbsp;extent in the appointment by central administrative boards. There&nbsp;are five counties and thirty-eight towns. The municipal governments of Newport and Providence present interesting features, for&nbsp;which see the separate articles on these cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Education.</span><span class="font3">—The public school system of Rhode Island was established in 1800, abolished in 1803, and re-established in 1828.&nbsp;At the head of it is a commissioner of education, appointed by the&nbsp;governor and the Senate, and a board of education, composed of&nbsp;the governor and the lieutenant-governor </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ex officio</span><span class="font3"> and six other&nbsp;members elected by the General Assembly. Under an act of the&nbsp;12th </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font3">April 1883, as amended on the 4th of April 1902, education&nbsp;is compulsory for children between the ages of seven and fifteen,&nbsp;but the maximum limit is reduced to thirteen for children who are&nbsp;employed at lawful labour. The total enrolment in the public&nbsp;schools in 1905 was 71,425 and the total expenditure for public&nbsp;school purposes was $1,987,751. A considerable proportion of the&nbsp;Irish and the French Canadians send their children to the Roman&nbsp;Catholic parochial schools. The chief institutions for higher education are Brown University (1764), the State School of Design&nbsp;(1877), the State Normal School (reorganized 1898), and the Moses&nbsp;Brown School (1819), all at Providence </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font3"> and the State College&nbsp;of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (1888) at Kingston, a land grant&nbsp;college under the Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890, the Hatch Act of&nbsp;1887 and the Adams Act of 1906. This institution was founded&nbsp;as an agricultural school in 1888 and became a college in 1892.&nbsp;It has departments of agriculture, engineering and science, a&nbsp;library of 15,000 volumes and an experiment station. There are&nbsp;state training-schools for teachers at Providence, Cranston, Bristol,&nbsp;Barrington, Central Falls, Warwick and Pawtucket.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">@@@<sup>1</sup> Under the constitution of 1842 it was provided that there should be two sessions of the General Assembly annually: one at Newport&nbsp;in Klay, and the other in October to be held at South Kingstown&nbsp;once in two years, and the intermediate years alternately at Bristol&nbsp;and East Greenwich, an adjournment from the October session&nbsp;being held annually at Providence. In 1.854 this was amended:&nbsp;one session was provided for to be held in Newport in May, an&nbsp;adjournment being held annually at Providence. And in 1900&nbsp;by another amendment Providence became the only meeting-place&nbsp;of the General Assembly.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Charitable and Penal Institutions.—</span><span class="font3">A board of state charities and corrections, established in 1869, supervises and controls all of&nbsp;the penal, charitable and correctional institutions of the state at&nbsp;large and also the local almshouses. There were in 1910 nine&nbsp;members of the board, three from Providence county, one from&nbsp;each of the other counties, and one from the state at large; five&nbsp;were appointed by the governor with the consent of the Senate,&nbsp;and four were elected by the Senate. </span><span class="font1">A </span><span class="font3">group of institutions&nbsp;(under the control of the board) at Howard, in Cranston township, about 7 m. from Providence, including the Workhouse and&nbsp;House of Correction, the Hospital for the Insane (1869), the Almshouse, the State Prison and Providence County Jail, the Sock-anosset School for Boys, and the Oaklawn School for Girls, are&nbsp;supported entirely or in part by the state. In addition to the&nbsp;institutions under the board of charities and corrections there are&nbsp;two under the board of education, and supported wholly or in part&nbsp;by the state, the School for the Deaf (1877) and the Home and&nbsp;School for Dependent and Neglected Children (1885) at Providence.&nbsp;The Soldiers’ Home (1891) at Bristol, the Butler Hospital for the&nbsp;Insane (1847) at Providence, and a Sanitarium (1905) at Wallum&nbsp;Lake, in the township of Burrillville, also receive state aid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Finance.</span><span class="font3">—The chief sources of revenue in the order named are the general property tax, the tax on savings banks, the tax on&nbsp;insurance companies,. and liquor licences. There is no corporation&nbsp;tax. The total receipts from all sources for the year </span><span class="font1">1909 </span><span class="font3">were&nbsp;$2,3.17,512,. the expenditures $2,345,359. The public debt, which&nbsp;originated in 1752, amounted to £70,000 sterling in 1764, to £4000&nbsp;in 1775. and to $698,000 in 1783. Part of the Revolutionary debt&nbsp;was paid in depreciated paper, part was assumed by the United&nbsp;States government, part was paid at various rates of depreciation&nbsp;between 1803 and 1820, and the remainder, $43,971, was repudiated&nbsp;in 1847. Other obligations had accumulated in the meantime,&nbsp;however, so that the debt in 1848 amounted to $187,000. This&nbsp;was gradually reduced until the Civil War, when it was increased&nbsp;to $3,889,000 by 1865. A sinking fund commission was established&nbsp;in 1875, and the entire sum was extinguished by the ist of August&nbsp;1894. The issue of Tonds for the construction of the new capitol&nbsp;building and other purposes has led, however, to a new debt, which&nbsp;at the beginning of 1910 amounted to $4,800,000. There w<sup>r</sup>as at&nbsp;the same time a sinking fund of $654,999. Before the adoption&nbsp;of the Federal constitution Rhode 1 stand was badly afflicted with&nbsp;the paper money heresy. £5000 were printed Jn 1710, and from&nbsp;that time until 1751 there were nine separate issues. These were&nbsp;gradually retired, however, through the efforts of the mercantile&nbsp;classes, aided by the parliamentary statutes of 1751 and 1763, and&nbsp;by about 1763 the finances were again placed on a sound money&nbsp;basis. The influx of Continental currency gave some trouble during&nbsp;the War of Independence, but there were no further local issues&nbsp;until 1786, when £100,000 were issued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The first banks organized in the state were the providence Bank in 1791, the Bank of Rhode Island at Newport in 1795, and the&nbsp;Washington Bank at Westerly in 1800. Forty-four charters had&nbsp;been issued in 1826 and sixty in 1837. Partly through restrictive&nbsp;local legislation and partly as a result of the operation of the Suffolk&nbsp;system of redemption in Boston, these institutions were always&nbsp;conservative. During practically the entire period before tne&nbsp;Civil War their note issues constituted a smaller proportion of the&nbsp;capital, stock than those of any other state. By an act of 1858&nbsp;which is still in force, annual reports must be presented to the state&nbsp;auditor. On the establishment of the national banking system,&nbsp;1863-65, nearly all of the banks took out national charters.&nbsp;Since 1865 the most notable features have been the rise and decadence of the national banks and the rise of the trust companies.&nbsp;During the decade from 1890 to 1900 the deposits in the national&nbsp;banks increased only 5%, from $16,700,000 to $17,500,000; those&nbsp;of the trust companies increased 330%, from $12,000,000 to more&nbsp;than $40,000,000. During the period from 1890 Jo 1901 twenty&nbsp;national banks retired from business, and the total capital stock </span><span class="font2">was </span><span class="font3">reduced from about twenty millions to about thirteen millions of dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History.—</span><span class="font1">Rhode Island was founded by refugees from Massachusetts, who went there in search of religious and&nbsp;political freedom. The first settlements were made at Providence by Roger Williams (ç.e.) in June 1636, and at&nbsp;Portsmouth on the island of Aquidneck by the Antinomians,&nbsp;William Coddington (1601-1678), John Clarke (1609-1676),&nbsp;and Anne Hutchinson (1591-1643), in March-April 1638.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
