<p><span class="font1">very simple; in the country west of the Aravallis only one crop is raised in the year, while in other parts south and east of the&nbsp;Aravallis two crops are raised annually, and various kinds of&nbsp;cereals, pulses and fibres are grown. In the desert tracts fine&nbsp;breeds of camels, cattle, horses and sheep are to be found&nbsp;wherever there is pasturage. Irrigation, mostly from wells,&nbsp;is almost confined to the N. portion. The country is traversed&nbsp;throughout by the Rajputana railway, with its Malwa branch&nbsp;in the south, and diverging to Agra and Delhi in the north.&nbsp;Jodhpur, Udaipur and Bikanir have constructed branch&nbsp;railways at their own cost, the first of which was extended in&nbsp;1901 to Hyderabad in Sind. In 1909 another line was opened&nbsp;running N. near the E. boundary from Kotah to Bharatpur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History. </span><span class="font1">—Only faint outlines can be traced of the condition of Rajputana previous to the invasion of Upper India by the&nbsp;Mahommedans, and these indicate that the country was subject&nbsp;for the most part to two or three powerful tribal dynasties.&nbsp;Chief of these were the Rahtors, who ruled at Kanauj; the&nbsp;Chauhans of Ajmere; the Solankis of Anhilwara, in Gujarat;&nbsp;the Gehlots with the Sisodhyias sept, still in Mewar or Udaipur;&nbsp;and the Kachwaha clan, still in Jaipur. These tribal dynasties&nbsp;of Rajputs were gradually supplanted by the Moslem invaders&nbsp;of the nth century and weakened by internal feuds. At the&nbsp;beginning of the 16th century the Rajput power began to revive,&nbsp;only to be overthrown by Baber at Fatehpur Sikri in 1527.&nbsp;The clans were finally either conquered, overawed or conciliated&nbsp;by Akbar—all except the distant Sisodhyia clan, which, however, submitted to Jehangir in 1616. From Akbar’s accession&nbsp;to Aurangzeb’s death, a period of 151 years, the Mogul was&nbsp;India’s master. Aurangzeb’s death and the invasion of Nadir&nbsp;Shah led to a triple alliance among the three leading chiefs,&nbsp;which internal jealousy so weakened that the Mahrattas, having&nbsp;been called in by the Rahtors to aid them, took possession of&nbsp;Ajmere about 1756; thenceforward Rajputana became involved in the general disorganization of India. By the end of&nbsp;the century nearly the whole of Rajputana had been virtually&nbsp;subdued by the Mahrattas. The victories of Generals Wellesley&nbsp;and Lake, however, saved the Rajputs; but on Lord Wellesley’s&nbsp;departure from India the floodgates of anarchy were reopened&nbsp;for ten years. On the outbreak of the Pindari War in 1817 the&nbsp;British government offered its protection. The Pindaris were&nbsp;put down, Amir Khan submitting and signing a treaty which&nbsp;constituted him the first ruler of the existing state of Tonk.&nbsp;By the end of 1818 similar treaties had been executed by the&nbsp;other Rajput states with the paramount power. Sindhia gave&nbsp;up the district of Ajmere to the British, and the pressure of the&nbsp;great Mahratta powers upon Rajputana was permanently&nbsp;withdrawn. Since then the political history of Rajputana has&nbsp;been comparatively uneventful. The great storm of the&nbsp;Mutiny of 1857, though dangerous while it lasted, was short.&nbsp;Most of the rajas remained loyal; and the capture of the town&nbsp;of Kotah, which had been held by the mutineers of that state,&nbsp;in March 1858, marked the extinction of armed rebellion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rajputana is of great archaeological interest, possessing some fine religious buildings in ruins and others in excellent&nbsp;preservation. Among the latter are the mosques at Ajmere&nbsp;and the temples on Abu. But the most characteristic features&nbsp;of architecture in the country are shown in the forts and&nbsp;palaces of the chiefs and in their cenotaphs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RAJSHAHI, a district and division of British India, in the province of Eastern Bengal and Assam. The administrative&nbsp;headquarters are at Rampur Boalia. The area of the district&nbsp;is 2593 sq. m., comprising an alluvial plain seamed with old&nbsp;river-beds and studded with marshes. The Ganges and the&nbsp;Mahananda are its principal rivers; the former constitutes a&nbsp;great, natural boundary-line to the south and south-west, and&nbsp;the latter, which rises in the Himalayas, borders the district&nbsp;on the west for a few miles before joining the Ganges. Other&nbsp;rivers are the Narad and Baral, important offshoots of the&nbsp;Ganges; the Atrai, a channel of the Tista; and the Jamuna,&nbsp;a tributary of the Atrai. Both the Atrai and the Jamuna&nbsp;belong to the Brahmaputra system and are navigable throughout&nbsp;the year for small cargo boats. The drainage of Rajshabi is&nbsp;not carried off by means of its rivers, but through the chains of&nbsp;marshes and swamps, the most important of which is the Chalan&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bhil</span><span class="font1"> or lake, which discharges itself into the Brahmaputra.&nbsp;In 1901 the population was 1, 462, 407, showing an increase of&nbsp;1∙6% in the decade. Rice is the staple crop, with pulses,&nbsp;oilseeds and jute. Indigo has disappeared. Sericulture has&nbsp;received a stimulus from the efforts of the agricultural department, supported by private enterprise, to improve the breed&nbsp;of silkworms. The hemp grown on a small tract in the north&nbsp;of the district supplies all the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ganja</span><span class="font1"> that is consumed in Bengal.&nbsp;The district is traversed from south to north by the main line&nbsp;of the Eastern Bengal railway to Darjeeling, with a branch to&nbsp;Bogra. Most of the permanent buildings in the district were&nbsp;severely damaged by the earthquake of the 12th of June 1897.&nbsp;When the East India Company took over the administration of&nbsp;Bengal in 1765, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">zamindari</span><span class="font1"> of Rajshabi or Nattor was one&nbsp;of the largest and most important in the province. It appears&nbsp;to have extended from Bhagalpur on the west to Dacca on the&nbsp;east, and to have included an important subdivision called Nij-Chakla Rajshahi on the south of the Ganges. The total area&nbsp;was estimated at 13, 000 sq. m., or more than five times the size&nbsp;of the present district. Having been found much too large&nbsp;to be effectually administered by one central authority, Rajshahi&nbsp;was stripped in 1793 of a considerable portion of its outlying&nbsp;territory, and a natural boundary-line was drawn to the west,&nbsp;south and east along the Ganges and Brahmaputra. Its&nbsp;north-western limits were reduced in 1813, when the present&nbsp;district of Malda was constituted. The erection of Bogra into&nbsp;a separate jurisdiction in 1821 still further reduced its area;&nbsp;and in 1832 the limits of Rajshahi were fixed by the constitution&nbsp;of Pabna into an independent jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Division</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">of Rajshahi</span><span class="font1"> is coextensive with northern Bengal, from the Ganges to the mountains. It comprises the&nbsp;seven districts of Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Jalpaiguri, Malda,&nbsp;Rangpur Bogra and Pabna. Total area, 18, 091 sq. m.

In military and naval use&nbsp;“ to rake ’’ means to enfilade, to fire so that the shot may pass&nbsp;lengthwise along a ship, a line of soldiers, entrenchments, &amp;c.&nbsp;In the nautical sense of the projection or slope of a ship’s bows&nbsp;or stem or the inclination of a mast, the word is apparently&nbsp;an adaptation of the Scandinavian </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raka,</span><span class="font1"> to reach, in the sense&nbsp;of reach forward.</span></p>
