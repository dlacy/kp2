a kind of ring made to turn round in a ſtaple, or other ring.

The trunnions of this piece are contained in a sort of iron crotch, of which the lower end terminates in a cylindrical pivot reſting in the socket, ſo as to ſupport the weight of the cannon. The socket is bored in a ſtrong piece of oak, reinforced with iron hoops, in order to enable it to ſuſtain the recoil. By means of this frame, which is called the s <hi rend="italic">wivel,</hi> and an iron handle on its caſe cable, the gun may be directed by the hand to any object. It is therefore very neceſſary in the tops, particularly when loaded with muſket-balls, to fire down on the upper decks of the adverſary in action.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
