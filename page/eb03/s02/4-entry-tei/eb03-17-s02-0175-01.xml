<hi rend="italic">(Scrutinium),</hi> in the primitive church, an examination or probation practiſed in the laſt week of Lent, on the catechumens, who were to receive baptiſm on the Eaſter-day. The ſcrutiny was performed with a great many ceremonies. Exorciſms and prayers were made over the heads of the catechumens; and on Palm Sunday, the Lord’s Prayer and Creed were given them, which they were afterwards made to rehearſe. This cuſtom was more in uſe in the church of Rome than anywhere elſe; though it appears, by ſome miſſals, to have been likewiſe uſed, though much later, in the Gallican church. It is ſuppoſed to have ceaſed about the year 860. Some traces of this practice ſtill remain at Vienne, in Dauphiné, and at Liage.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scrutiny</hi> is alſo uſed, in the canon law, for a ticket or little paper billet, wherein at elections the electors write their votes privately, ſo as it may not be known for whom they vote. Among us the term <hi rend="italic">ſcrutiny</hi> is chiefly uſed for a ſtrict peruſal and examination of the ſeveral votes haſtily taken at an election; in order to find out any irregularities committed therein, by unqualified voters, &amp;c.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
