New York and Philadelphia, 90 miles in 112 minutes. The 440 miles from New York to Buffalo are run in 10¾ hours, and the 960 miles from New York to Chicago in 25 hours. A great obstacle to fast running is the original vice of construction with level highway and railway crossings. Only few lines are provided with the block signals and interlocking apparatus required with numerous fast trains ; but the use of continuous air-brakes is general. There has been more success in designing appliances to mitigate the effect of accidents than in inventions for avoiding them altogether. Accidents are very numerous, the casualties being more frequent in proportion to traffic than in the principal European countries. The number of accidents to passengers, however, is insignificant when compared with that of accidents to employés and persons walking over crossing-lines. In 1880 the numbers killed and injured were (Table XXXVIII.):—

This gives one passenger killed for every 43,280,000 miles travelled, and one injured to every 11,375,000. In the United Kingdom there were one passenger killed for every 960,000 miles run by passenger trains, and one injured for every 254,000 miles.
Though American railways have steeper grades and sharper curves than in Europe, the loads carried in freight trains are sometimes exceptionally large : trains of 45 or 50 eight-wheeled cars each loaded with nearly 18 tons are common. The average load on the principal lines has been doubled since 1870, largely by the adoption of heavier and more powerful locomotives and by the better management of trains, and to some extent by a better condition of permanent wτ ay. This has had much to do with the great reduction in the rates charged. The cost of working American railways is usually a larger proportion of the earnings than in Europe. An American railway which spends 60, 66⅔, or 75 per cent, of its earnings for working expenses would in England be called costly to work. The expense per ton per mile on several railways in recent years has been, in cents per ton of 2000 lb (Table XXXIX.) :—

American railways also contrive to do their work with a very small number of men. In 1880 86,781 miles of railway were worked with a force of 418,957 men, or 4∙7 men per mile, against 367,793 in the United Kingdom on 18,681 miles, or 19∙7 per mile, and 316,570 in Germany, or 143 per mile. The greater thinness of traffic on American lines accounts for but part of this, for the number of train-miles per year per man employed in different countries is 929 in the United States, 350 in the United Kingdom, 476 in Germany, 395 in Austria-Hungary. A better measure of the
work done per man is the number of passenger and ton miles for each man employed (which cannot be given for the United Kingdom) ; this is shown in Table XLI. :—

(A. M. W.-D. W. D.)
RAIMBACH, Abraham (1776-1843), line-engraver, a Swiss by descent, was born in London in 1776. Educated at Archbishop Tenison’s Library School, he was an apprentice to J. Hall the engraver from 1789 to 1796. For nine years part of his working-time was devoted to the study of drawing in the Royal Academy and to executing occasional engravings for the booksellers, whilst his leisure hours Were employed in painting portraits in miniature. Having formed an intimacy with Sir David Wilkie, Raim-bach in 1812 began to engrave some of that master’s best pictures. The Village Politicians, the Rent-Day, the Cut Finger, Blind-Man’s Buff, the Errand-Boy, Distraining for Rent, the Parish Beadle, and the Spanish Mother and Child raised him in the estimation of connoisseurs, the French especially holding him in great honour. It is said that he never employed any assistants, but executed the whole of his plates With his own hand. At his death, in 1843, he held a gold medal awarded to him for his Village Politicians at the Paris Exhibition of 1814. He was elected corresponding member of the Institute of France in 1835.

RAINBAND. Every transparent substance is perfectly
opaque to some particular kinds of light. A certain shade of orange light is absorbed by the vapour of water, and, when sunlight which has traversed a stratum containing this vapour is decomposed in a spectroscope, the blank caused by the missing rays appears as a black band or group of fine lines. This is called the rainband, because from its intensity the amount of moisture in the atmosphere may be guessed at, and the occurrence of rain predicted with considerable certainty. It has long been known that the spectrum of sunlight shows lines of telluric as well as of solar origin. The former constitute the absorption-spectrum of the atmosphere (see SPECtro-
