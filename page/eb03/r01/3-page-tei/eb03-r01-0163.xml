From this laſt ſtage of the pι⅛)-ceſs, a tranſmigration was eaſily ſuppoſed : and hence we hear of the gods of Egypt wandering about like ſo many vagrants in brute ſhapes, and of princes being tranſlated into ſtars, becauſe a ſtar was their emblem in hieroglyphic, or ſtood for their name in figurative lan-guage. And, in like manner, we ſee, from the ſpeci-men of this character -which is ſtill preſerved on ce-leſtial globes, how the heavens aj firſt came to be filled with bears, ſeorpions, and dragons, and with a va-riety of other animals.</p><p>The opinions concerning the ſtate of the dead are ſtill more numerous than thoſe concerning the place where they reiide. Rude nations have generally thought that the future ſtate is limilar to the preſent; that plants, animals, and inanimate things there, have their ſhades ; and that theſe contribute as much to the pleaſures and conveniences of the dead as their realities do to the li-ving ; that huſhands have their wives (s), lovers their miſtreſſes, warriors their battles, huntſmen their ſport ; and that all their paſſions, amuſements, and bufineſs, are the ſame as formerly. For this reaſon, that the dead may not appear unprovided in the next world, like the ancient Gauls, ſome tribes of India, America, and Africa, bury with them in the ſame grave their wives, their arms, their favourite animals, and their neceffary utenfils.</p><p>Ί he ancient Egyptians, who believed in tranſmigra-tion, ſuppoſed that the ſoul was after death obliged to animate every ſpecies of bird and quadruped, of reptile and infect, and was not to return to a human form till after a period of 3500 years, others have confined their tranſmigrations to particular animals, as the ſoul oſ man to the human form, and the ſoul of the brute to the bodies of the ſpecies to which it belonged. Some bave changed the brute into man, and man into the brute, that man might ſuffer injuries ſimilar to what he had inflicted, and the brute retaliate what he had ſuffered. others have confined the human ſoul in plants and in ftones ; and Bell of Antermony mentions an Indiau who ſuppoſed that his anceſtors might be in fiſhes.</p><p>The notions of Homer were probably thoſe of many of his time. But theſe notions were difimd indeed, when his hero Ulyffes vifited the ſhades, many of the ghoſts ſeemed to retain the mangled and ghaſtly appearance which they had ct death 5 and, what is worſe, feemed to be all ſtarving with hunger, innumerable multitudes, with loud ihrieks, flocking to the fleams of lus ſlain victim-as to a moſt ſumptuoug and delicious banquet.</p><p>For ſcarcely had the purple torrent flow’d,</p><p>And all the caverns imok’d with ſtreaming blood, when, lo ! appear’d along the duſky coaſts Thin airy flιoals oſ viſionary ghoſts ;</p><p>Fair penfive youths, and ſoft enamour’d maids,.</p><p>And wither’d elders, pale and wrinkl’d ſhades.</p><p>Ghaſtly with wounds, the forms of warriors ſlain, Stalk’d with majeſtic port, a martial train.</p><p>Thςfe, and a thouſand more, ſwarrn’d o’er the ground, And all the dire aſſembly ſhriek’d around.</p><p>Ulyſſes ſaw, as ghoſt by ghoſt aroſe,</p><p>All wailing with unutterable woes.</p><p>Alone, apart, in diſcontented mood,</p><p>A gloomy ihade, the ſullen Ajax ſtood ;</p><p>For ever fad, with proud diidain he pin’d,</p><p>And the loſt arms lor ever ſtung his mind.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Upon Ulyfſts faying to Achilles,</hi></p><p>Alive, we hail’d thee with our guardian gods ;</p><p>And, dead, thou rul’ſt a king in theſe abodes ;</p><p><hi rend="italic">Thefhade replfd :</hi></p><p>Talk not of ruling in this dol’rous gloom,</p><p>Nor think vain words (he cry’d) can eaſe my doom ; Rather I ehυυfe laboriouſly to bear</p><p>A weight of woes, and breathe the vital air,</p><p>A slave to some poor hind that toils for bread. Than live a scepter’d monarch of the dead.</p><p>In this gloomy region no one is rewarded for his virtue, nor is puniſhed for his crimes, unleſs committed, like thoſe of Siſyphus, Tantalus, and Ixion, againſt the gods. AU indeed are claifed into groups, from a certain analogy of age, fex, fate, and diſpolition ; but all appear to be equally unhappy, having their whole heart and affections concentrated in a world to which they are fated never to return.</p><p>The Elyfιum of Homer is allotted only for the rela-tions and deſcendants of the gods ; and Menelaus goes to this country of perpetual ſpring (τ), not as a perlon of ſuperior merit, but becauſe he had married the daughter of Jove.</p><p>Even long after a future ſtate had become the ſcene of rewards and puniſhments, theſe for the moſt part were diſtributed, not according to moral, but phyfical diſtinctions. with the Greeks and Romans,.the ſoul was condemned to many calamities for a number of</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(r)</hi>     A military gentleman who refided at Penobſcot during the late American war, aſſured us that the Indians, when defired to ſubfcribe a written agreement, drew always the picture of the object or animal whoſe name they bore. But for fuller information on this ſubject, ſee Clavigero’s Hiſt. of Mexico.</p><p>(s)    The queſtion which the Sadducees put to our Saviour about the wile of the ſeven brothers, is a proof</p><p>that the Phariſees thought there was marriage and giving in marriage in the future ſtate, and that it was ſome-what ſimilar to the preſent.    ...</p><p>(τ) Homer fends the ghoſt of Hercules to the ſhades, while Hercules himſelf is quaffing nectar with Hebe in the ſkies. Οηε ſoul of the hero is therefore repining with the ghoſts of mortals in the regions below, while the other is enjoying all the happineſs of the gods above. (See odyssey, B. II. near the end). Philoſophers ſince have improved on this hint oſ the poet ; and men have now got rational, animal, and vegetable ſouls, to which ſometimes a fourth one is added, as properly belonging to matter in general. Homer infιnuateε, that Menelaus was to be tranſiated to Elyſium without taſting death. This Elyſium is the habitation of men, and not of ghoſts, and is deſcribed as being ſimilar to the feat of the gods.
