<p><span class="font0">Ryle was a strong supporter of the evangelical school. Among his longer works are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Christian Leaders of the Eighteenth Century&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1869), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Expository Thoughts on the Gospels</span><span class="font0"> (7 vols., 1856-69),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Principles for Churchmen</span><span class="font0"> (1884). His second son, Herbert&nbsp;Edward Ryle (b. .1856), a distinguished Old Testament&nbsp;scholar, was made bishop of Exeter in 1901, and in 1903&nbsp;bishop of Winchester.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYLSK, a town of Russia, in the government of Kursk, 71 m. by rail W.S.W. of the town of Kursk. It is connected by a&nbsp;branch line with the Kursk-Kiev railway. Pop. (1897) 11,415.&nbsp;It has oil works, blast furnaces, and manufactories of soap and&nbsp;tallow, and an active trade in corn, hemp, and scythes imported&nbsp;from Austria. It was founded in the 9th century, and is&nbsp;frequently mentioned in the annals from 1152 onwards. Its&nbsp;cathedral was built in the 15th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RYMER, THOMAS (1641-1713), English historiographer royal, was the younger son of Ralph Rymer, lord of the manor of&nbsp;Brafferton in Yorkshire, described by Clarendon as “ possessed&nbsp;of a good estate,” and executed for his share in the “Presbyterian rising ” of 1663. Thomas was probably born at Yafforth&nbsp;Hall early in 1641, and was educated at a private school kept at&nbsp;Danby-Wiske by Thomas Smelt, a noted Royalist, with whom&nbsp;Rymer was “ a great favourite,” and “ well known for his great&nbsp;critical skill in human learning, especially in poetry and history.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He was admitted as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pensionarius minor</span><span class="font0"> at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, on April 29, 1658, but left the university&nbsp;without taking a degree. On May 2, 1666, he became a member&nbsp;of Gray’s Inn, and was called to the bar on June 16, 1673. His&nbsp;first appearance in print was as translator of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cicero's Prince&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1668), from the Latin treatise (1608) drawn up for Prince Henry.&nbsp;He also translated Rapin’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Reflections on Aristotle's Treatise of&nbsp;Poesie</span><span class="font0"> (1674), with a preface in defence of the classical rules&nbsp;for unity in the drama, and followed the principles there set&nbsp;forth in a tragedy in verse, licensed September 13, 1677, called&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Edgar, or the English Monarch,</span><span class="font0"> which was a failure. The printed&nbsp;editions of 1678, 1691 and 1693 belong to the same issue, with&nbsp;new title-pages. Rymer’s views on the drama were again given&nbsp;to the world in the shape of a printed letter to Fleetwood&nbsp;Shepheard, the friend of Prior, under the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Tragedies&nbsp;of the Last Age Consider'd</span><span class="font0"> (1678, 2nd ed. 1692). To </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ovid's&nbsp;Epistles Translated by Several Hands</span><span class="font0"> (1680), with preface by&nbsp;Dryden, “ Penelope to Ulysses ” was contributed by Rymer,&nbsp;who was also one of the “ hands ” who “ Englished ” the Plutarch&nbsp;of 1683-86. ’ The life of Nicias fell to his share. He furnished&nbsp;a preface to Whitelocke’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Memorials of English Affairs</span><span class="font0"> (1682),&nbsp;and wrote in 1681 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A General Draught and Prospect of the Government of Europe,</span><span class="font0"> reprinted in 1689 and 1714 as 0/ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the Antiquity,&nbsp;Power, and Decay of Parliaments,</span><span class="font0"> where, ignorant of his future&nbsp;dignity, the critic had the misfortune to observe, “ You are not&nbsp;to expect truth from an historiographer royal.” He contributed&nbsp;three pieces to the collection of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Poems to the Memory of Edmund&nbsp;Waller</span><span class="font0"> (1688), afterwards reprinted in Dryden’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Miscellany&nbsp;Poems,</span><span class="font0"> and is said to have written the Latin inscription on&nbsp;Waller’s monument in Beaconsfield churchyard. The preface&nbsp;to the posthumous </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Historia Ecclesiastica</span><span class="font0"> (1688) of Thomas&nbsp;Hobbes is said to have been by Rymer, but the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Life of Hobbes&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1681) sometimes ascribed to him was written by Richard&nbsp;Blackburne. He produced a congratulatory poem upon the&nbsp;arrival of Queen Mary in 1689. His next piece of authorship&nbsp;was to translate the sixth elegy of the third book of Ovid’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tristia</span><span class="font0"> for Dryden’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Miscellany Poems</span><span class="font0"> (1692, p. 148). On the&nbsp;death of Thomas Shadwell in 1692 Rymer received the appointment of historiographer royal, at a yearly salary of £200. Immediately afterwards appeared his much discussed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Short View of&nbsp;Tragedy</span><span class="font0"> (1693), criticizing Shakespeare and Ben Jonson, which&nbsp;produced </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Imperial Critick</span><span class="font0"> (1693) of Dennis, the epigram of&nbsp;Dryden@@<sup>2</sup> and the judgment of Macaulay that Rymer was “ the&nbsp;worst critic that ever lived.” John Dunton </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Life and Letters,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">p. 3S4)&gt; however, considered him “ orthodox and modest,” and&nbsp;Pope “ one of the best critics we ever had ” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Spence's Anecdotes).&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Rymer contended that although Shakespeare possessed humour&nbsp;he had no genius for tragedy, Othello being merely “ a bloody&nbsp;farce without salt or savour.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Within eight months of his official appointment Rymer was directed (August 26, 1693) to carry out that great national&nbsp;undertaking with which his name will always be honourably&nbsp;connected, and of which there is reason to believe that Lords&nbsp;Somers and Halifax were the original promoters. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Codex&nbsp;Juris Gentium Diplomatics</span><span class="font0"> (1693) of Leibnitz was taken by the&nbsp;editor as the model of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Foedcra.</span><span class="font0"> The plan was to publish&nbsp;all records of alliances and other transactions in which England&nbsp;was concerned with foreign powers from 1101 to the time of&nbsp;publication, limiting the collection to original documents in the&nbsp;royal archives and the great national libraries. Unfortunately,&nbsp;this was not uniformly carried out, and the work contains some&nbsp;extracts from printed chronicles. From 1694 he corresponded&nbsp;with Leibnitz, by whom he was greatly influenced with respect&nbsp;to the plan and formation of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Foedera.</span><span class="font0"> While collecting&nbsp;materials, Rymer unwisely engraved a spurious charter of King&nbsp;Malcolm, acknowledging that Scotland was held in homage&nbsp;from Edward the Confessor. When this came to be known&nbsp;the Scottish antiquaries were extremely indignant. G. Redpath&nbsp;published a MS. on the independence of the Scottish crown, by&nbsp;Sir T. Craig, entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scotland's Sovereignly Asserted</span><span class="font0"> (1695), and&nbsp;the subject was referred to by Bishop Nicolson in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scottish&nbsp;Historical Library</span><span class="font0"> (1702). This led Rymer to address three&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Letters to the Bishop of Carlisle</span><span class="font0"> (1702-1706) explaining his action,&nbsp;and discussing other antiquarian matters. Sir Robert Sibbald&nbsp;answered the second letter (1704). The first and second letters&nbsp;are usually found together; the third is extremely rare. Rymer&nbsp;had now been for some years working with great industry,&nbsp;but was constantly obliged to petition the crown for money to&nbsp;carry on the undertaking. Up to August 1698 he had expended&nbsp;£1253, and had only received £500 on account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At last, on November 20,1704, was issued the first folio volume of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Foedera, Conventiones, Litterae el cujuscunque generis Acta&nbsp;Publica inter reges Angliae et alios quosvis imperatores, reges, &amp;c.,&nbsp;ab. A.D.1101 .ad nostra usque tempora habita aut tradata.</span><span class="font0"> The&nbsp;publication proceeded with great rapidity, and fifteen volumes&nbsp;were brought out by Rymer in nine years. Two hundred and&nbsp;fifty copies were printed; but, as nearly all of them were presented&nbsp;to persons of distinction,' the work soon became so scarce&nbsp;that it was priced by booksellers at one hundred guineas. A&nbsp;hundred and twenty sheets of the fifteenth volume and the copy&nbsp;for the remainder were burnt at a fire at William Bowyer's, the&nbsp;printer, on January 30, 1712-13. Rymer died shortly after the&nbsp;appearance of this volume, but he had prepared materials for&nbsp;carrying the work down to the end of the reign of James I.&nbsp;These were placed in the hands of Robert Sanderson, his assistant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For the greater part of his life Rymer derived his chief subsistence from a mortgage assigned to him by his father. His miscellaneous literary work could not have been very profitable.&nbsp;At one time he was reduced to offer his MSS. for a new edition&nbsp;for sale to the earl of Oxford. About 1703 his affairs became&nbsp;more settled, and he afterwards regularly received his salary as&nbsp;historiographer, besides an additional £200 a year as editor of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Foedera.</span><span class="font0"> Twenty-five copies of each volume were also allotted&nbsp;to him. He died at AAindel Street, Strand, December 14, 1713,&nbsp;and was buried in the church of St Clement Danes. His will&nbsp;was dated July 10,1713. Tonson issued an edition of Rochester’s&nbsp;Worfo (1714), with a short preface by the late historiographer.&nbsp;Another posthumous publication was in a miscellaneous collection called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Curious Amusements,</span><span class="font0">by M. B. (1714), which included&nbsp;“ some translations from Greek, Latin and Italian poets, by T.</span></p><div>
