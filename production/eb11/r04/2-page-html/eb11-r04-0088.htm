<p><span class="font2">Romans an arch of Tanus Quadrifrons. Though partly built of earlier fragments, it is late in style, and jnay be the Arcus Con-stantini mentioned in the Xlth region. The finest existing arch&nbsp;is that by the Colosseum erected by Constantine. It owes, however,&nbsp;little of its beauty to that artistically degraded period. Not only&nbsp;most of its reliefs but its whole design and many of its architectural&nbsp;features were stolen from an earlier arch erected by Trajan as an&nbsp;entrance to his forum (see above). The arch of Claudius, built in&nbsp;43 to commemorate his supposed victories in Britain, stood across&nbsp;the Via Lata (modern Corso) in the Piazza Sciarra. Its exact&nbsp;position ¡s shown in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bull. Comm. Arch. Rom.,</span><span class="font2"> 1878, pi. iv. Its remains&nbsp;were removed in the middle of the 16th century,@@and nothing now&nbsp;is left but half its inscription, preserved in the garden of the Barberini&nbsp;palace. It is shown on both aurci and denarii of Claudius, with&nbsp;an attic inscribed </span><span class="font1">DR BRITANNIS, </span><span class="font2">and surmounted by a quadriga&nbsp;and trophies. A little to the N. of the Piazza Colonna was an&nbsp;arch popularly called the Arco di Portogallo, destroyed in 1665,&nbsp;whose reliefs are now in the Palazzo dei Conservatori. They appear&nbsp;to date from the reign of Hadrian, but may have been used at a&nbsp;later time to decorate this arch. An arch also stood opposite&nbsp;S. Maria in Via Lata until 1498, which was probably erected by&nbsp;Diocletian in </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font2"> 303. The central part of the once triple arch of&nbsp;Gallicnus still exists on the Esquiline; it took the place of the ancient&nbsp;Porta Esquilina of the Servian wall. It is built of travertine, is&nbsp;simple in design, with coarse details, and has an inscription on its&nbsp;attic. The two side arches and pediment over the centre existed&nbsp;in the 16th century, and are shown in the Mantuan oil-painting&nbsp;of Rome,@@and in several antiquarian works of the 16th century.&nbsp;The inscription (C./.L. vi. 1106) records that it was erected in&nbsp;honour of Gallicnus and his wife Salonina by Aurelius Victor@@</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The column of Antoninus Pius was a monolith of red granite, erected after his death by his adopted sons M. Aurelius and L.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Verus. One fragment of it is preserved in the Vatican with an interesting quarry incription, recording that it&nbsp;was cut in the ninth year of Trajan’s reign, under the supervision&nbsp;of Dioscurus and the architect Aristides. The rest of its fragments&nbsp;were used by Pius VI. to repair the obelisk of Monte Citorio, set&nbsp;up by Augustus in the Campus Martius as the gnomon of a sundial&nbsp;(Plin. Z/.AT. xxxvi. 72). The .marble pedestal of the Antonine&nbsp;column is now in the Vatican; it has reliefs representing the&nbsp;apotheosis of Faustina and Antoninus Pius, and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">decursio equitum&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">which formed part of the funeral ceremony. This and the column&nbsp;of M. Aurelius were both surmounted by colossal portrait statues&nbsp;of gilt bronze. The column of M. Aurelius is very similar in size&nbsp;and design to that of Trajan. Its spiral reliefs represent victories&nbsp;in Germany from 171-175, arranged in twenty tiers. Like the&nbsp;column of Trajan, it is exactly. 100 Roman ft. high, without the&nbsp;pedestal. The pedestal was originally much higher.than at present,&nbsp;but is now partly buried; it is shown by Gamucci, Du P6rac and&nbsp;other 16th-century writers. This column stood in front of a temple&nbsp;to M. Aurelius, and within a great peribolus, forming a forum&nbsp;similar to that of Trajan, though much smaller; the remains of this&nbsp;temple, amongst other buildings, probably form the elevation nqw</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">called Monte Citorio.@@</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The prehistoric cemeteries of Rome are described above </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Prehistoric Rome),</span><span class="font2"> Few tombs exist of the Roman period earlier than the 1st&nbsp;century </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.,</span><span class="font2">—probably owing to the great extension of the&nbsp;city beyond the Servian limits, which thus obliterated the&nbsp;earlier burial-places. The tomb of the Cornelii Scipiones is the most&nbsp;important of early date which still exists. It is excavated in the&nbsp;tufa rock at the side of the Via Appia, outside the Porta Capena.&nbsp;Interments of the Scipio family went on here for about 400 years,&nbsp;additional chambers and passages being excavated from time to time.&nbsp;The peperino sarcophagus </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font2">Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus&nbsp;(Liv. x. 12, 13), consul in 298 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.,</span><span class="font2"> is now in the Vatican; its inscription, in rude Saturnian verse., is one of the most important existing&nbsp;specimens of early Latin epigraphy. Many other inscribed slabs&nbsp;were found in the 17th century, covering the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">loculi</span><span class="font2"> in which lay the&nbsp;bodies of later members of the family. Those now existing in the&nbsp;tomb are modern copies@@This burial-place of the Scipios is unlike&nbsp;those of other families, owing to the gens Cornelia keeping up the&nbsp;early custom of interment without burning; thus stone sarcophagi&nbsp;or loculi (rock-cut recesses) were required instead of mere pigeonholes to hold the cinerary urns. The tomb of M. Bibulus, a few&nbsp;yards outside the Porta Fontinalis, and remains of two recently</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">discovered during the destruction of the Aurelian towers at the Porta Salara, date from about the middle of the 1st century </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.,</span><span class="font2"> as&nbsp;does also the curious tomb of the baker Eurysaces outside the Porta&nbsp;Maggiore. In 1863 an interesting tomb of the Sempronia gens<sup>@@6</sup>&nbsp;was discovered on the Quirinal, below the royal palace, near the site&nbsp;of the Porta Salutaris. It is of travertine, with a rich entablature&nbsp;and frieze sculptured with the Greek honeysuckle ornament (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bull. Comm. Arch.,</span><span class="font2"> 1876,126, pi. xii.). This also is of the last years&nbsp;of the republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The mausoleum of Augustus, built 28 </span><span class="font1">B.c., </span><span class="font2">stood in the north part of the Campus Martius, between the Tiber and the Via Flaminia.&nbsp;It is a massive cylindrical structure of concrete, faced with&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">opus reticulatum</span><span class="font2">; according to Strabo, this was faced with</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">white stone,’* </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font2"> travertine; inside w'as a series of radiating chambers, in plan like a wheel. On the top was a great mound of&nbsp;earth, planted with trees and flowers (Tac. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ann.</span><span class="font2"> lii. 9). In the&nbsp;middle ages it was converted into a fortess by the Colonna, which was&nbsp;destroyed in 1167. In the 16th century the central portion was&nbsp;occupied by a garden.<sup>@@7</sup> Only the bare core exists now, with its&nbsp;fine </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">opus reticulatum,</span><span class="font2"> best seen in the court of the Palazzo Valdam-brini. The inside is concealed by modern seats, being now used as&nbsp;a concert-hall (Anfiteatro Chorea). The sepulchral inscription in&nbsp;honour of Augustus, engraved on two bronze columns at the entrance,&nbsp;is preserved to us by its copy atAncyra </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font2"> It records an almost&nbsp;incredible amount of building: in addition to the long list of building mentioned by name Augustus says, </span><span class="font1">DVO. ET. OCTAGINTA.&nbsp;TEMPLA.DEVM. IN.VRBE . CONSVL. SEXTVM . REFECI. </span><span class="font2">The&nbsp;first burial in the mausoleum of Augustus was that of M. Claudius&nbsp;Marcellus (died 23 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.),</span><span class="font2"> and it continued to be the imperial tomb&nbsp;till the death of Nerva, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font2"> 98, after whose interment there was no&nbsp;more room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The mausoleum of Hadrian, built by that emperor as a substitute for that built by. Augustus, and dedicated in </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A.D. </span><span class="font2">138 by his successor,&nbsp;was a large circular building on a square podium; its walls, of&nbsp;enormous thickness, were of tufa fared with Parian marble and&nbsp;surrounded by a colonnade with rows of statues,—a work of the&nbsp;greatest magnificence. . The splendour of the whole is described by&nbsp;Procopius </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">CBell. Goth.</span><span class="font2"> i. 22), who mentions its siege by the Goths,&nbsp;when the defenders hurled statues on to the heads of the enemy.&nbsp;In the 7th century the church of S. Angclus inter Nubes was built&nbsp;on its summit, and all through the middle ages it served as a papal&nbsp;fortress. The interior chambers are still well preserved, but its&nbsp;outside has been so often wrecked and refaced that little of the&nbsp;original masonry is visible.<sup>@@8</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Several of the grander sepulchral monuments of Rome were built in the form of pyramids. One of these still exists, included in the&nbsp;Aurelian wall, by the Porta Ostiensis. It is a pyramid of&nbsp;concrete, 118 feet high, faced with blocks of white marble,&nbsp;and contains, a small chamber decorated with painted&nbsp;stucco. An inscription in large letters on the marble&nbsp;facing records that it was built as a tomb for C. Cestius, a praetor,&nbsp;tribune of the people, and septemvir of the epulones (officials who&nbsp;supervised banquets in honour of the gods). It was erected,&nbsp;according to Cestius’s will, by his executors, in the space of 330 days.&nbsp;It dates from the time of Augustus<sup>@@9</sup>(see Falconieri, in Nardini,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Roma Antica,</span><span class="font2"> iv. p. 1, ed. 1818-20). Another similar pyramid,&nbsp;popularly known as the tomb of Romulus, stood between the mausoleum of Hadrian and the basilica of St Peter. It was destroyed&nbsp;at the close of the 15th century, during the rebuilding of the long&nbsp;bridge which connects the former building with the Vatican.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1 he. earliest bridge was a wooden drawbridge called the Pons Sublicius from the piles </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(sublicae)</span><span class="font2"> on which it was built. The&nbsp;river being an important part of the defence of Rome from&nbsp;the Aventine to the Porta Flumentana (see plan of Servian&nbsp;wall, fig. 8), no permanent bridges were made till the Romans were&nbsp;strong enough not to fear attacks from without. The Pons Sublicius&nbsp;had a sacred.character, and was always restored in wood, even in the&nbsp;imperial period.<sup>@@10</sup> Its exact site is doubtful, but it must be placed&nbsp;some d istance below the Ponte Rot to.
