(Lucius Annaeus), a Stoic philoſopher, was born at Corduba in Spain, about the beginning of the Chriſtian era, of an Equeſtrian family, which had probably been tranſplanted thither in a colony from Rome. He was the ſecond ſon of Marcus Annaeus Seneca, commonly called the <hi rend="italic">rhetorician,</hi> whole remains are printed under the title of <hi rend="italic">Suaſoriae</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">Controversiae, cum Declamationum Excerptis;</hi> and his youngeſt brother Annaeus Mela (for there were three of them) bad the honour of being father to the poet Lucan. He was removed to Rome, together with his father and the reſt of his family, while he was yet in his infancy. There he was educated in the most liberal manner, and under the beſt maſters. He learned eloquence from his father ; but his genius rather leading him to philoſophy, he put himſelf under the ſtoics Attalus, Sotion, and Papirius Fabianus ; men famous in their way, and of whom he has made honourable mention in his writings. It is probable, too, that he travelled when he was young, ſince we find him, in ſeveral parts of his works, particularly in his Qu <hi rend="italic">aestiοnes Naturales,</hi> making very exact and curious observations upon Egypt and the Nile.— But this, though entirely agreeable to his own humour, did not at all correſpond with that ſcheme or plan of life which his father had drawn out for him ; who therefore forced him to the bar, and put him upon ſoliciting for public employments ; ſo that he afterwards became quaeſtor, prætor, and, as Lipſius will have it, even conſul.</p><p>In the firſt year of the reign of Claudius, wſhen Julia the daughter of Germanicus was accuſed of adultery by Meſſalina, and baniſhed, Seneca was baniſhed too, being charged as one of the adulterers. Corsica was the ſeat of his exile, where he lived eight years ; "happy in the midſt of thoſe things which uſually make other people miſerable ; <hi rend="italic">inter eas res beatus, qua solent miſeros facere:”</hi> and where he wrote his books of consolation, addreſſed to his mother Helvia, and to his friend Polybius, and perhaps ſome of thoſe tragedies which go under his name ; for he ſays, <hi rend="italic">modo se levioribus studiis ibi oblectasse.</hi> Agrippina being married to Claudius, upon the death of Meſſalina, ſhe prevailed with the emperor to recal Seneca from baniſhment ; and afterwards procured him to be tutor to her ſon Nero, whom ſhe deſigned for the empire. Africanus Burrhus, a prætorian præfect, was joined with him in this important charge : and these two preceptors, who were entruſted with equal authority, had each his reſpective department. By the bounty and generality of his royal pupil, Seneca ac</p><p>quired that prodigious wealth which rendered him in a manner equal to kings. His houſes and walks were the moſt magnificent in Rome. His villas were innumerable : and he had immenſe ſums of money placed out at intereſt in almoſt every part of the world. The hiſtorian Dio reports him to have had 250,000 l. Sterling at intereſt in Britain alone ; and reckons his calling it in all at a ſum, as one of the cauſes of a war with that nation.</p><p>All this wealth, however, together with the luxury and effeminacy of a court, does not appear to have had any ill effect upon the temper and dispoſition of Seneca. He continued abſtemious, exact in his manners, and, above all, free from the vices ſo commonly prevalent in ſuch places, flattery and ambition. “ I had rather (ſaid he to Nero) offend you by ſpeaking the truth, than pleaſe you by lying and flattery : <hi rend="italic">maluerim veris offendere, quam placere adulando.’’</hi> How well he acquitted himſelf in quality of preceptor to his prince, may be known from the five firſt years of Nero’s reign, which have always been considered as a perfect pattern of good government ; and if that emperor had but been as observant of his maſter through the whole courſe of it, as he was at the beginning, he would have been the delight, and not, as he afterwards proved, the curſe and deteſtation of mankind. But when Poppæa and Tigellinus had got the command of his humour, and hurried him into the moſt extravagant and abominable vices, he ſoon grew weary of his maſter, whoſe life muſt indeed have been a constant rebuke to him. Seneca, perceiving that his favour declined at court, and that he had many accuſers about the prince, who were perpetually whiſpering in his ear the great riches of Seneca, his magnificent houſes and fine gardens, and wſhat a favourite through means of theſe he was grown with the people, made an offer of them all to Nero. Nero refuſed to accept them : which, however, did not hinder Seneca from changing his way of life ; for, as Tacitus relates, he “ kept no more levees, declined the uſual civilities which had been paid to him, and, under a pretence of indiſpoſition, or ſome engagement or other, avoided as much as poſſible appearing in public.”</p><p>Nero, in the mean time, who, as it is ſuppoſed, had dispatched Burrhus by poison, could not be eaſy till he had rid himſelf of Seneca alſo : For Burrhus was the manager of his military concerns, and Seneca conducted his civil affairs. Accordingly, he attempted, by means of Cleonicus, a freedman of Seneca, to take him off by poiſon ; but this not ſucceeding, he ordered him to be put to death, upon an information that he was privy to Piso’s conſpiracy againſt his perſon. Not that he had any real proof of Seneca’s being at all concerned in this plot, but only that he was glad to lay hold of any pretence for deſtroying him.— He left Seneca, however, at liberty to cbooſe his manner of dying ; who cauſed his veins to be opened immediately. His wife Paulina, who was very young in compariſon of himſelf, had yet the reſolution and affection to bear him company, and thereupon ordered her veins to be opened at the same time ; but as Nero was not willing to make his cruelty more odious and inſupportable than there ſeemed occaſion for, he gave orders to have her death prevented : upon which her wounds were bound up, and the blood ſtopped, in juſt time enough to ſave her ; tho’, as Tacitus ſays, ſhe looked ſo miſer-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0271.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0265"/>
ably pale and wan all her life after, that it was eaſy to read the loss of her blood and ſpirits in her countenance. In the mean time, Seneca, finding his death flow and lingering, deſired Statius Annæus his phyſician to give him a dose of poison, which had been prepared ſome time before in case it ſhould be wanted ; but this not having its uſual effect, he was carried to a hot bath, where he was at length ſtiſted with the ſteams. He died, as Lipſius conjectures, in the 63d or 64th year of his age, and in about the 10th or 11th of Nero’s reign. Tacitus, on mentioning his death, obſerves, that, as he entered the bath, he took of the water, and with it ſprinkled ſome of his neareſt domeſtics, saying, “ That he offered thoſe libations to Jupiter the Deliverer.” Theſe words are an evident proof that Seneca was not a Chriſtian, as ſome have imagined him to have been ; and that the 13 epiſtles from Seneca to St Raul, and from St Paul to Seneca, are ſuppoſititious pieces. His philosophical works are well known.— They conſiſt of 124 <hi rend="italic">epistles</hi> and diſtinct treatiſes ; and, except his books of phyſical queſtions, are chiefly of the moral kind, treating of anger, conſolation, providence, tranquillity of mind, conſtancy, clemency, the ſhortneſs of life, a happy life, retirement, benefits. He has been juſtly cenſured by Quintilian and other critics, as one of the firſt corrupters of the Roman ſtyle ; but his works are highly valuable, on account of the vaſt erudition which they diſcover, and the beautiful moral ſentiments which they contain.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
