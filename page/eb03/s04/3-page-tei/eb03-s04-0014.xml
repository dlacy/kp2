It proſpers indeed beſt in swamps, though the grain is better in a drier soil. Next to rice the cassada conſtitutes the chief food oſ the inhabitants, and is cultivated with great care. The country likewiſe produces yams, various kinds of potatoes, eddoes, or the <hi rend="italic">arum eſculentum.</hi> Oil-palm, plantains, and bananas ; papaw, guava, oranges and limes; pompions, melons, and cucumbers ; pine-apples, pigeon- peas, which dressed like Engliſh peas are a good pulſe ; maize or Indian corn ; millet, cocoa-nut trees ; ockra ; the tallow-tree ; a great variety of tamarinds ; different kinds of fig-trees and plums ; a kind of fruit reſembling grapes, but more acid and acrid ; cherries reſembling a fine nectarine in taſte ; a ſpecies of the bread fruit-tree; the cream fruit, ſo called becauſe when wounded it yields a fine white juice reſembling ſugar or the beſt milk, of which the natives are very fond ; the mala- guetta pepper, or grains of paradiſe ; a new ſpecies of nutmeg, but whether ſo good as the common fort has not yet been aſcertained ; a new ſpecies of the Peruvian bark, which it is hoped will prove as uſeful as the other ; and cola, a fruit highly eſteemed by the natives for the  same virtues with that bark; the ricinus, caſſia, dye- stuffs, and gums, of great value ; cotton, tobacco, and sugar-canes, which, it is thought, would thrive exceedingly well under proper cultivation.</p><p>Considering the ardour of the maritime nations of Europe for settling colonies in diſtant regions of the globe, it is ſomewhat ſurprising that a climate ſo temperate and a soil ſo productive as that of Sierra Leona did not  long ago attract their notice. But it was left to be colonized for a better purpoſe than that which firſt drew the natives of Europe to the West Indies and the American continent. Being thinly inhabited, Sierra Leona appeared to ſome benevolent gentlemen in England a place where, without incommoding the natives, a ſufficient quantity of ground might be bought on which to  settle a great number of free negroes, who in 1786 swarmed in London in idleneſs and want. About 400 of theſe wretches, together with 60 whites, mostly women of bad character and in ill health, were accordingly ſent out, at the charge of government, to Sierra Leona. Neceſſity, it was hoped, would make them induſtrious and orderly ; and Captain Thomſon of the navy, who conducted them, obtained, for their use, a grant of land to his majeſty from king Tom, the neighbouring chief, and afterwards from Naimbanna, the king of the country. The colony, however, ſoon went to ruin; but the land which they occupied being about 20 miles ſquare, his majeſty was enabled to grant by act of parliament to another colony founded on better principles and for a ſtill nobler purpoſe.</p><p>The moſt intelligent members of that ſociety, which  has laboured ſo ſtrenuouſly to procure an abolition of the ſlave-trade, juſtly concluding that the natives of Guinea would reap very little benefit from the attainment of their object, unleſs they ſhould be taught the principles of religion and the arts of civil life, which alone can render them really free, conceived the plan of a colony at Sierra Leona to be ſettled for the truly generous purpoſe of civilizing the Aſricans by maintaining with them a friendly intercourſe, and a commerce in every thing but men. This plan could not be carried into effect but at a very great expence. Subſcriptions were therefore opened upon rational and equitable terms, and a sum deemed ſufficient was ſpeedily raiſed.</p><p>An act of parliament was paſſed in favour of the ſubscribers, by which they were incorporated by the denomination of the <hi rend="italic">Sierra Leona Company ;</hi> and in pursuance of that act they held their firſt meeting at London on the 19th of October 1791, when the following gentlemen wore choſen directors for that year	</p><p>“Henry Thornton, Esq; M.P. chairman-Philip Charles Middleton, Bart.—Sir George Young, Knt. William Wilberforce, Eſq; M. P.-Rev. Thomas Clarkſon, A. M. -Joſeph Hardcaſtle, Esq; -John Kingston, Esq;-Samuel Parker, Eſq;-Granville Sharp, Eſq;-William  Sandford, Esq;- Vickeris Taylor, Eſq;—George Wolf, Esq."</p><p>The directors having ſtated the natural advantages of Sierra Leona, and its present miserable condition, obſerved, that they had not merely to eſtabliſh a commercial factory, but that, to introduce civilization, cultivation, and a ſafe trade, the company must provide or the ſecurity of the perſons and property of the colonists. The directors therefore reſolved, that three or four veſſels ſhould sail at once, with ſuch a number of people as would be able to protect and aſſist each other; with goods both for trade and for the ſupply of the colony Accordingly ſeveral veſſels ſailed, having on board a council for the government of the colony and the management of the company’s affairs ; a number of artificers and other ſervants of the company ; ſome ſoldiers, and a very few Engliſh ſettlers. The directors were laudably cautious in the choice of coloniſts. They admitted into the ſociety no white man of bad character, or who was not a declared enemy to the ſlave-trade; and as the chief object of their enterpriſe was the civilization of the natives, it was with great propriety that they choſe more than three-fourths of their ſettlers from the <hi rend="italic">free</hi> negroes in Nova Scotia, who had borne arms for the Britiſh government during the American war. The Superintendant and council were particularly inſtructed to ſecure to all blacks and people of colour, at Sierra Leona, equal rights and equal treatment, in all reſpects, with whites. They were to be tried by jury, as well as others ; and the council was deſired to allot to the blacks employments ſuited to their preſent abilities, and to afford them every opportunity of cultivating their talents. All practicable means of maintaining ſubordination were directed to be uſed ; and the council was eſpecially instructed to promote religion and morals, by ſupporting public worſhip and the due obſervance of the Sabbath, and by the inſtruction of the people, and the education of children. But no perſon was to be prevented from performing or attending religious worſhip in whatever place, time, or manner, he might think fit, or from peaceably inculcating his own religious opinions. Orders were given in chooſing the scite of a town, to conſider health as the firſt object ; and the firſt town was directed to be called <hi rend="italic">Free-Town.</hi> Articles for building and cultivation were ſent out, beſides the cargoes for proſecuting the company’s commerce; and schools for reading, writing, and accounts, were ordered to be set up for the purpose of inſtructing the children of ſuch natives as ſhould be willing to put them under the company’s care.</p><p>The leading object of the company was to ſubſtitute, for that diſgraceful traffic which has too long ſubſiſted,</p></body></text></TEI>
