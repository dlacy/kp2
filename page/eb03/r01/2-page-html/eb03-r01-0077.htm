<p><span class="font0">prudent </span><span class="font1">a∣ he was zealous ; and, as thc minds of the Swedes were in a fluctuating ſtate, he wifely avoided&nbsp;all kind of vehemence and precipitation in ſpreading&nbsp;the new doctrine. Accordingly, the firft object of his&nbsp;attention was the inſtruction of his people in the ſa-cred doctrines of the Holy Scriptures : for which pur-poſe he invited into his dominions feveral learned Ger-mans, and ſpread abroad through the kingdom the&nbsp;Swediſh tranſlation of the Bible that had been made&nbsp;by olaus Petri. Some time after this, </span><span class="font0">in 1526, </span><span class="font1">he&nbsp;appointed a conference at Upfal, between this reformer&nbsp;and Peter Gallius, a zealous defender of the ancient ſu-perſtition, in which each of the champions was to bring&nbsp;forth his arguments, that it might be ſeen on which&nbsp;fide the truth lay. In this diſpute olaus obtained&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font1">fignal victory ; which contributed much to confirm&nbsp;Guſtavus in his perſuaſion of the truth of Luther’s doc-trine, and to promote its progrefs in Sweden. The&nbsp;following year another event gave the finiſhing ſtroke&nbsp;to its propagation and ſuccefs. This was the aſſembly&nbsp;¢f the ſtates at weſteraas, where Guſtavus recommend-ed the doctrine of the reformers with ſuch zeal, that,&nbsp;after warm debates fomented by the clergy in general,&nbsp;rt was unanimouſly refolved that the reformation introduced by Lutiιer ſhould have place in Sweden. This&nbsp;refolution was principally owing to the firmneſs and&nbsp;magnanimity of Guſtavus, who declared publicly, that&nbsp;he would lay down the fceptre and retire from the&nbsp;kingdom, rather than rule a people enſlaved by the orders and authority of the pope, and more contracted by&nbsp;the tyranny of their biſhops than by the laws of their&nbsp;monarch. From this time the papal empire in Sweden was entirely overthrown, and Guſtavus declared&nbsp;head of the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Denmark, the reformation was introduced as early as the year 1 ς2τ, in conſequence of the ardent deſire&nbsp;diſcovered by Chriſtiern II. of having his fubjects in-ſtructed in the doctrines of Luther. This monarch,&nbsp;notwithſtanding his cruelty, for which his name has&nbsp;been rendered odious, was nevertheleſs deſirous of delivering his dominions from the tyranny of the church&nbsp;of Rome. For this purpofe, in the year 1 Ç20, he ſent&nbsp;for Martin Reinard, one of the difciples of Carloſtadt,&nbsp;out of Saxony, and appointed him profeffor of divinity&nbsp;at Hafnia ; and after his death, which happened in&nbsp;1521, he invited Carloſtadt himielf to fill that important place. Carloſtadt accepted of this office indeed,&nbsp;but in a ſhort time returned to Germany ; upon which&nbsp;Chriſtiern uſed his utmoſt endeavours to engage Lu-ther to viſit his dominions, but in vain. However, the&nbsp;progreſs of Chriſtiern, in reforming the religion of his&nbsp;ſubjects, or rather of advancing his own power above&nbsp;that of the church, was checked, in the year 1523,&nbsp;by a conſpiracy, by which he was depofed and baniſhed ; his uncle Frederic·, duke of Holilein and Sleſwic,&nbsp;being appointed his ſucceſſor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Frederic conducted the reformation with much greater prudence than his predeceſſor. He permitted the Proteſtant doctors to preach publicly the fentiments&nbsp;of Luther, but did not venture to change the eſtabliſh-ed government and diſcipline of the church. However,&nbsp;he contributed greatly to the progreſs of the reforma-tion, by his ſucceſsful attempts in favour of religious&nbsp;liberty in an aſſembly of the ſtates held at odenſee in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">1527. Here he procured the publication of a famous</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">edict, by which every ſubject of Denmark was deekj' red free either to adhere to the tenets of the church of&nbsp;Rome, or to tfie doctrine of Luther. The papal tyranny was totally deſtroyed by his ſucceſſor Chri-ſtiern III. He began by ſuppreſſing the deſpotic au»&nbsp;thority of the biſhops, and reſtoring to their lawful&nbsp;owners a great part of the wealth and poſſeſſions which&nbsp;the church had acquired by various ſtratagems. Ι'fiis&nbsp;was followed by a plan of religious doctrine, worſhip,&nbsp;and discipline, laid down by Bugenhagius, whom the&nbsp;king had ſent for from wittemberg for that purpoſe ;&nbsp;and in 1539 <sup>an</sup> aſſembly oſ the ſtates at odenſee gave&nbsp;a ſolemn ſanction to all theſc tranſactions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In France alſo, the reformation began to make ſome progreſs very early. Margaret queen of Navarre,&nbsp;fiſter to Francis I. the perpetual rival of Charles V. was&nbsp;a great friend to the new doctrine ; and it appears&nbsp;that, as early as the year 1523, there were in ſeveral&nbsp;of the provinces of France great numbers of people&nbsp;who had conceived the greateſt averſion both to the&nbsp;doctrine and tyranny of the church of Rome ; among&nbsp;whom were many of the firſt rank and dignity, and&nbsp;even ſome of the epiſcopal order. But as their number increafed daily, and troubles and commotions were&nbsp;excited in ſeveral places on account of the religious differences, the authority of the king intervened, and&nbsp;many perſons eminent for their virtue and piety were&nbsp;put to death in the moſt barbarous manner. Indeed&nbsp;Francis, who had either no religion at all, or, at beſt,&nbsp;no fixed and conſiſtent fyſtem of religious principles,&nbsp;conducted himſelf towards the Proteſtants in ſuch </span><span class="font0">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">manner as beſt anſwered his private views. Sometimes&nbsp;he reſolved to invite Melancthon into France, probably&nbsp;with a view to pleaſe his fiſter the queen of Navarre,&nbsp;whom he loved tenderly, and who had ſtrongly imbibed the Proteſtant principles. At other times he eχ-ercifed the moſt infernal cruelty towards the reformed ;&nbsp;and once made the following mad declaration, That if&nbsp;he thought the blood in his arm was tainted by the&nbsp;Lutheran hereſy, he woctd have ſt cut off ; and that&nbsp;he woctd not ſpare even his own children, if they en-tertained ſentiments contrary to thoſe of the Catholic&nbsp;church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">About this time the famous Calvin began to draw the attention of the public, but more eſpecially of the&nbsp;queen of Navarre His zeal expofed him to danger j&nbsp;and the friends of the reformation, whom Francis was&nbsp;daily committing to the flames, placed him more than&nbsp;once in the moſt perilous ſituation, from which he was&nbsp;delivered by the interpoſition of the queen of Navarre.&nbsp;He therefore retired out of France to Baſil in Swiſſei-land; where he publiſhed his Chriſtian Inſtitutions, and&nbsp;became afterwards ſo famous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>l</sup>pmfe <sup>amon</sup>S' <sup>t</sup>^<sup>ιe</sup> French who firſt renounced the juriſdiction of the Romiſh church, are commonly called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lutherans</span><span class="font1"> by the writers of thoſe early times.&nbsp;Hence it has been ſuppoſed that they had all imbibed&nbsp;the peculiar ſentiments of Luther. But this appears by&nbsp;no means to have been the caſe : for the vicinity of&nbsp;the cities of Geneva, Laufanne, &amp;c. which had adopted the doctrines of Calvin, produced a remarkable effect upon the French Proteſtant churches ; infomuch&nbsp;that, about the middle of this century, they all entered&nbsp;into communion with the church of Geneva. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">French Proteſtants were called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">IIuguenoW*</span><span class="font0"> by </span><span class="font1">their ad-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
