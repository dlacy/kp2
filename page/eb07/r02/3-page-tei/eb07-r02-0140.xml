He was a man of great natural abilities, which had received the utmost degree of cultivation, through the care of his mother, the celebrated Cornelia, and the example of his relatives, the Scipios. Circumstances had led him to mark the baneful practice of the wealthy families, in assigning to slaves the cultivation of their lands, and thus causing the removal to the city of that class of free and privileged men, who ought to have been the main proprietors and tenants of the soil, which the valour of their fathers and of themselves had won for Rome. The evil consequences of thus forming a population of agricultural slaves, and needy citizens prepared for every enormity, both by their degradation and their distress, arrested the attention of Gracchus ; and he resolved to exert himself for the removal of that corruption which was already preying so deeply on the vitals of the commonwealth. His desire was to relieve the distress of the lower orders, and to prevent the danger of their relapse into an equally unfavourable condition. Having been elected tribune of the people, he availed himself of his official power, and proposed a better division of the public lands. At first he sought merely the re-enactment of the Licinian law in a modified form, somewhat better suited to the altered circumstances of the republic. In this he was strenuously opposed by the senate, and also by one of his colleagues in the tribunate; Octavius. The opposition, instead of inducing Gracchus to adopt more prudent methods of conciliation, roused his indignation, and from a patriot, anxious only to promote the public weal, converted him into a demagogue, determined to effect his purpose by whatever means and at whatever hazard to his country’s welfare. He brought forward a new law much more harsh in its provisions than the Licinian ; and being still opposed by Octavius, he procured his ejection from the tribuneship, contrary to the principles of the constitution, which he thus himself set the example of violating. He then carried the new law, and got himself, his brother, and his father-in-law appointed as commissioners for surveying the public lands, and taking steps preparatory to a new division.</p><p>Had Gracchus contented himself with these enactments, and done his utmost to carry them into peaceful execution, he might after all have been regarded as a true patriot, and might have been the preserver of his country ; but he now found himself in the position, into which, sooner or later, every demagogue finds himself driven. It had become necessary for him to retain popular support, even fbr his own personal safety, if he should remain at Rome after the expiration of his year of tribuneship. He therefore introduced other measures more calculated to maintain his popularity, than to promote the true interests of the community. He proposed a distribution of the treasures of Attalus among the people ; a reduction of the period of military service ; and the right of appeal from the sentence of the judges to the people. Measures so glaringly democratic incensed the senate to the very highest degree ; and as his tribune-ship was now nearly expired, during which his person was inviolable, he endeavoured to procure his re-election as a tribune, both that he might retain the power of pressing forward his proposed enactments, and for the security of his personal safety. The aristocratic party in the senate were now resolved to have recourse to any method of removing such a dangerous foe. They mustered all their partizans, disturbed the proceedings of the comitia, and interrupted them both by intrigues and violence. At length, on the second day of the comitia, held for the election of tribunes, when both parties had mustered in full force, Tiberius wishing to inform the people tllat his life was in danger, and the tumult being too great for him to be heard, raised his hand to his head ; tllis gesture the opposite party misinterpreted into a sign ofhis wish that the people should crown him ; and Scipio Nasica rushed out of tlle senate-house at the head of the most determined of its members, loudly accusing Gracchus of a conspiracy to make himself king. A fierce conflict ensued, the friends of Gracchus dispersed and fled, and he was killed during the confusion of the tumult. About three hundred of the democratic party fell along with their leader, and their bodies were cast into the Tiber.</p><p>Thus terminated the attempt of the elder Gracchus to reform the abuses which were rapidly destroying the virtue of the Roman state and people ; and like all unsuccessful attempts, it but served to consolidate more firmly what it had shaken, but not removed. The senate did not indeed venture directly to repeal the Sempronian law for the division of the public land, which had superseded that of Licinius, but left it to fall into desuetude like its predecessor. In the contest, however, both parties had been guilty of tlle most glaring violations of both law and justice; both parties contemned the fundamental principles ofthe constitution ; and both manifested an utter disregard for the true welfare of the republic, in their eager endeavours to prosecute their self-interested views. How different from the early struggles between the patrician and plebeian bodies, in which no blood was shed by either party, and the utmost that even the oppressed plebeians threatened, was to forsake the city which denied them the rights of citizens ! But the love of country had perished in the sordid pursuit of wealth; and there no longer remained enough of true patriotism to impel the contending parties to resort to mutual concessions for the general good. A contest so begun and so waged, could have no other termination than in tlle complete destruction of the one or the other of the contending bodies, or in the overthrow of both by some designing and powerful usurper, and thus in the total subversion of the constitution and the extinction of Roman liberty.</p><p>Within the course of a few years the contest was renewed, and with more determination and energy than before, under the conduct of Caius Gracchus, the younger brother of Tiberius. During the interval that elapsed between the death of Tiberius and the public appearance of Caius, the tribunes of the people had prosecuted their endeavours to increase their own power, especially in tlle renewal of their tenure of official dignity. The senate managed to impede their endeavours chiefly by bestowing on them such employments as required them to be absent from Rome; and Caius himself was detained as quaestor in Sicily, even beyond the legal term of that office. Immediately on his return he was chosen tribune of the people, and forthwith resumed with double energy the enterprise of his brother. His first object was to enforce the Agrarian law's ofhis brother, which had hitherto been kept in abeyance, and to renew the commission appointed to survey the public lands. Being chosen a second time to the tribuneship, he procured the enactment of a law transferring the judicial power entirely from the senate to the equestrian order ; and he even attempted to procure the addition of three hundred knights to the senate, for the purpose of overpowering their deliberations by the votes of his own partizans. Another of his laws provided that the soldiers should be clothed at the expense of the public, without diminution of their pay ; another secured the regular distribution of corn to the poor</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
