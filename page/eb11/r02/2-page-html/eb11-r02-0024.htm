Liddon </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Some Elements. of Religion,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Lecture I. 19) says: “ Lactantius may be wrong in his etymology,&nbsp;but he has certainly seized the broad popular sense of the word&nbsp;when he connects it with the idea of an obligation by which man&nbsp;is bound to an invisible God.” Archbishop Trench </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Study of&nbsp;Words)</span><span class="font2"> supposed that when “ religion ” became equivalent to&nbsp;the monastic life, and “ religious ” to a monk, the words lost&nbsp;their original meaning, but the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ancren Riwle<sub>i</sub> ante</span><span class="font2"> 1225, and the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cursor Mundi</span><span class="font2"> use the words both in the general and the more&nbsp;particular sense (see quotations in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New English Dictionary),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and both meanings can be found in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Imitatio Christi</span><span class="font2"> and in&nbsp;Erasmus’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Colloquia.</span><span class="font2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(X.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The study of the forms of belief and worship belonging to different tribes, nations or religious communities has only&nbsp;recently acquired a scientific foundation. The Greek historians&nbsp;early directed their attention to the ideas and customs of the&nbsp;peoples with whom they were brought into contact ; and&nbsp;Herodotus has been called the “ first anthropologist of religion.” Theopompus described the Persian dualism in the 4th&nbsp;century </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.,</span><span class="font2"> and when Megasthenes was ambassador to the&nbsp;court of Chandragupta, 302 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.,</span><span class="font2"> he noted the religious usages&nbsp;of the middle Ganges valley. The early Christian Fathers&nbsp;recorded many a valuable observation of the Gentile faiths&nbsp;around them from varying points of view, sympathetic or&nbsp;hostile; and Eusebius and Epiphanius, in the 4th century&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.,</span><span class="font2"> attributed to the librarian of Ptolemy Philadelphus the&nbsp;design of collecting the sacred books of the Ethiopians,&nbsp;Indians, Persians, Elamites, Babylonians, Assyrians, Romans,&nbsp;Phoenicians, Syrians and Greeks. The AIahommedan BiruiiI&nbsp;(b. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d,</span><span class="font2"> 973) compared the doctrines of the Greeks, Christians,&nbsp;Jews, Manichaeans and Sufis with the philosophies and religions of India. Akbar (1542-1605) gathered Brahmans and&nbsp;Zoroastrians, Jews, Christians and Mahommedans at his court,&nbsp;and endeavoured to get translations of their scriptures. In the&nbsp;next century the Persian author of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Dabistan</span><span class="font2"> exhibited the&nbsp;doctrines of no less than twelve religions and their various sects.&nbsp;Meanwhile the scholars of the West had begun to work. Thomas&nbsp;Hyde (1636-1703) studied the religion of the ancient Persians;&nbsp;John Spencer (1630-1693) analysed the laws of the Hebrews;&nbsp;and Lord Herbert of Cherbury </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(De Religione Gentilium,</span><span class="font2"> 1645)&nbsp;endeavoured to trace all religions back to five “ truly Catholic&nbsp;truths ” of primitive faith, the first being the existence of God.&nbsp;The doctrine of a primeval revelation survived in various forms&nbsp;for two centuries, and appeared as late as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Juventus Mundi&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">of W. E. Gladstone (1868, p. 207 ff.). David Hume, on the other&nbsp;hand, based his essay on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Natural History of Religion</span><span class="font2"> (1757)&nbsp;on the conception of the development of human society from&nbsp;rude beginnings, and all modern study is frankly founded on the&nbsp;general idea of Evolution.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The materials at Hume’s command, however, were destined to vast and speedy expansion. The Jesuit missionaries had&nbsp;already been at work in India and China, and a brilliant band of&nbsp;English students, led by Sir William Jones ând H. T. Colebrooke,&nbsp;began to make known the treasures of Sanskrit literature,&nbsp;which the great scholars of Germany and France proceeded to&nbsp;develop. In Egypt the discovery of the Rosetta stone placed&nbsp;the key to the hieroglyphics within Western reach; and the&nbsp;decipherment of the cuneiform character enabled the patient&nbsp;scholars of Europe tq recover the clues to the contents of the&nbsp;ancient libraries of Babylonia and Assyria. With the aid of&nbsp;inscriptions the cults of Greece and Rome have been largely&nbsp;reconstructed. Travellers and missionaries reported the beliefs&nbsp;and usages of uncivilized tribes in every part of the world,&nbsp;with the result that “ ethnography knows no race devoid of&nbsp;religion, but only differences in the degree to which religious&nbsp;ideas have developed ” (Ratzel, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History of Mankind,</span><span class="font2"> i. 40).&nbsp;Meanwhile philosophy was at work on the problem of the&nbsp;religious consciousness. The great series of ,German thinkers,&nbsp;Lessing, Herder, Kant, Hegel, Fichte, Schleiermacher and their</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">successors, sought to explain religion by means of the phenomena of mind, and to track it to its roots in the processes of thought&nbsp;and feeling. While ethnography was gathering up the facts&nbsp;from every part of the globe, psychology began to analyse the&nbsp;forms of belief, of action and emotion, to discover if possible&nbsp;the key to the multitudinous variety which history revealed.&nbsp;From the historical and linguistic side attention was first fixed&nbsp;upon the myth, and the publication of the ancient hymns of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rig Veda</span><span class="font2"> led Max Müller to seek in the common elements of&nbsp;Aryan thought for the secrets of primitive religion (essay on&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Comparative Mythology,</span><span class="font2"> 1856). The phenomena of day and&nbsp;night, of sunshine and storm, and other aspects of nature, were&nbsp;invoked by different interpreters to explain the conceptions of&nbsp;the gods, their origins and their referions. Fresh materials&nbsp;were gathered at the same time out of European folk-lore; the&nbsp;work begun by the brothers Grimm was continued by J. W. E.&nbsp;Mannhardt, and a lower stratum of beliefs and rites began to&nbsp;emerge into view beneath the poetic forms of the more developed&nbsp;mythologies. By such preliminary labours the way was&nbsp;prepared for the new science of anthropology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since the appearance of Dr E. B. Tylor’s classical treatise on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Primitive Culture</span><span class="font2"> (1871), the study of the origins of religion&nbsp;has becn pursued with the utmost zeal. Comte had already&nbsp;described the primitive form of the religious consciousness as&nbsp;that in which man conceives of all external bodies as animated&nbsp;by a life analogous to his own </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Philos. Positive,</span><span class="font2"> tome v., 1841,&nbsp;p. 30). This has been since designated as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">polyzoism</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Panthelism&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">panvitalism,</span><span class="font2">@@<sup>2</sup> and represents the obscure undifferentiated&nbsp;groundwork out of which Tylor’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Animism</span><span class="font2"> arises. Many are&nbsp;the clues by which it has been sought to explain the secret of&nbsp;primitive religion. Hegel, before the anthropological stage,&nbsp;found it in magic. Max Muller, building on philosophy and&nbsp;mythology, affirmed that “ Religion consists in the perception&nbsp;of the infinite under such manifestations as are able to influence&nbsp;the moral character of man ” (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Natural Religion,</span><span class="font2"> 1899, p. 188).&nbsp;Herbert Spencer derived all religion from the worship of the dead&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Principles of Sociology,</span><span class="font2"> i.), like Grant Allen, and Lippert in&nbsp;Germany. Mr Andrew Lang, on the other hand, supposes that&nbsp;belief in a supreme being came first in order of evolution, but&nbsp;was afterwards thrust into the background by belief in ghosts&nbsp;and lesser divinities </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Magic and Religion,</span><span class="font2"> 1901, p. 224).@@<sup>3</sup> Dr&nbsp;Jevons finds the primitive form in totemism </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Introd. to the&nbsp;History of Religion,</span><span class="font2"> 1896, chap. ix.). Mr J. G. Frazer regards&nbsp;religion (see his definition quoted below) as superposed on an&nbsp;antecedent stage of magic. In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Tree of Life</span><span class="font2"> (1905), Mr E.&nbsp;Crawley interprets it by the vital instinct, and connects its&nbsp;first manifestations with the processes of the organic life. The&nbsp;VeteranWilhelm Wundt </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Mythus und Religion,</span><span class="font2"> ii. 1906, p. 177)&nbsp;recurs to the primitive conceptions of the soul as the source of&nbsp;all subsequent development. The origin of religion, however,&nbsp;can never be determined archaeologically or historically; it&nbsp;must be sought conjecturally through psychology. (J. E. C.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">There is a point at which the History of Religion becomes in its predominant aspect a History of Religions. The conditions&nbsp;that we describe by the comprehensive term “ civilization ”&nbsp;occasion a specification and corresponding differentiation of the&nbsp;life of societies; whence there result competing types of culture,&nbsp;each instinct with the spirit of propagandism and, one might&nbsp;almost say, of empire. It is an age of conscious selection as&nbsp;between ideal systems. Instead of necessitating a wasteful&nbsp;and precarious elimination of inadequate customs by the actual&nbsp;destruction of those who practise them—this being the method&nbsp;of natural selection, which, like some Spanish Inquisition,&nbsp;abolishes the heresÿ by wiping out the heretics one and all—&nbsp;progress now becomes possible along the more direct and less</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
