<p><span class="font0">exhibits her image to the king, and Neptune conveys her across the seas; Justice, Health and Plenty endow her son; Prudence&nbsp;and Generosity are at her sides during the regency; and, when&nbsp;she resigns the helm of the state to the prince, Justice,&nbsp;Strength, Religion and Fidelity hold the oars. The sketches&nbsp;of all these paintings—now in the Munich Gallery—were&nbsp;painted in Antwerp, a numerous staff of distinguished&nbsp;collaborators being entrusted with the final execution. But&nbsp;the master himself spent much time in Paris, retouching the&nbsp;whole work, which was completed within less than four years.&nbsp;On the 13th of May 1625, Rubens writes from Paris to his&nbsp;friend Peiresc that both the queen and her son are highly satisfied with his paintings, and that Louis XIII. came on purpose&nbsp;to the Luxembourg, “ where he never has set foot since the&nbsp;palace was begun sixteen or eighteen years ago.” We also&nbsp;gather from this letter that the picture representing the&nbsp;“ Felicity of the Regency ” was painted to replace another,&nbsp;the “ Departure of the Queen,” which had caused some offence.&nbsp;Richelieu gave himself some trouble to get part of the work,&nbsp;intended to represent the life of Henry IV., bestowed upon&nbsp;Cavalier d’Arpina, but did not succeed in his endeavours. The&nbsp;queen’s exile, however, prevented the undertaking from going&nbsp;beyond a few sketches, and two or three panels, one of which,&nbsp;the “ Triumph of Henry IV.,” now in the Uffizi Gallery, is&nbsp;one of the noblest works of Rubens or of any master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the 11th of May 1625, Rubens was present at the nuptials of Henrietta Maria at Notre Dame in Paris, when the scaffolding&nbsp;on which he stood gave way, and he tells us he was just able to&nbsp;catch an adjoining tribune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No painter in Europe could now pretend to equal Rubens either in talent or in renown. Month after month productions&nbsp;of amazing size left the Antwerp studio; and to those unacquainted with the master’s pictures magnificent engravings&nbsp;by Vorsterman, Pontius and others had conveyed singularly&nbsp;striking interpretations. “ Whatever work of his .1 may&nbsp;require,” writes Moretus, the celebrated Antwerp printer,&nbsp;“ I have to ask him six months before, so as that he may think&nbsp;of it at leisure, and do the work on Sundays or holidays; no&nbsp;week days of his could I pretend to get under a hundred&nbsp;florins.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of the numerous creations of his brush, none, perhaps, will more thoroughly disclose to us Rubens’s comprehension of&nbsp;religious decorative art than the “ Assumption of the Virgin ”&nbsp;at the high altar of Antwerp cathedral, finished in 1625. It&nbsp;is, of twenty repetitions of this subject, the only example still&nbsp;preserved at the place for which it was intended. In spirit&nbsp;we are here reminded of Titian’s “ Assunta ” in the cathedral&nbsp;at Verona, but Rubens’s proves perhaps a higher conception&nbsp;of the subject. The work is seen a considerable way off, and&nbsp;every outline is bathed in light, so that the Virgin is elevated&nbsp;to dazzling glory with a power of ascension scarcely, if ever,&nbsp;attained by any master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although able to rely so greatly on his power as a colourist, Rubens is not a mere decorator. He penetrates into the&nbsp;spirit of his subjects more deeply than, at first sight, seems&nbsp;consistent with his prodigious facility in execution. The&nbsp;“ Massacre of the Innocents,” in the Munich Gallery, is a&nbsp;composition that can leave no person unmoved—mothers&nbsp;defending their children with nails and teeth. When St Francis&nbsp;attempts to shelter the universe from the Saviour’s wrath&nbsp;(Brussels Gallery), Rubens recalls to our memory that most&nbsp;dramatic passage of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Iliad</span><span class="font0"> when Hecuba, from the walls of&nbsp;Troy, entreats her son Hector to spare his life. Rubens was&nbsp;a man of his time; his studies of Italian art in no way led&nbsp;him back to the Quattrocentisti nor the Raffaeleschi; then-power was at an end. The influence of Michelangelo, Titian,&nbsp;Tintoretto, more especially Baroccio, Polidoro, and even&nbsp;Parmigiano, is no less visible with him than with those masters&nbsp;who, like Spranger, C. Schwartz and Goltzius, stood high in&nbsp;public estimation immediately before his advent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the midst of the rarest activity as a painter, Rubens was now called upon to give proofs of a very different kind&nbsp;of ability. The truce concluded between Spain and the Netherlands in 1609 ended in 1621; Archduke Albrecht died the&nbsp;same year. His widow sincerely wished to prolong the arrangement, still hoping to sec the United Provinces return to the&nbsp;Spanish dominion, and in her eyes Rubens was the fittest person&nbsp;to bring about this conclusion. The painter’s comings and&nbsp;goings, however, did not remain unheeded, for the French&nbsp;ambassador writes from Brussels in 1624—“ Rubens is here&nbsp;to take the likeness of the prince of Poland, by order of the&nbsp;infanta. I am persuaded he will succeed better in this than&nbsp;in his negotiations for the truce.” But, if Rubens was to&nbsp;fail in his efforts to bring about an arrangement with the&nbsp;Netherlands, other events enabled him to render great service&nbsp;to the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rubens and Buckingham met in Paris in 1625; a correspondence of some importance had been going on between the painter and the Brussels court, and before long it was proposed that he should endeavour to bring about a final arrangement between the Crowns of England and Spain. The infanta&nbsp;willingly consented, and King Philip, who much objected to&nbsp;the interference of an artist, gave way on hearing, through his&nbsp;aunt, that the negotiator on the English side, Sir Balthasar&nbsp;Gerbier—a Fleming by birth—was likewise a painter. Rubens&nbsp;and Gerbier very soon met in Holland. Matters went on very&nbsp;well, and Rubens volunteered to go to Spain and lay before the&nbsp;council the result of his negotiations (1628). Nine months&nbsp;were thus spent at Madrid; they rank among the most important in Rubens’s career. He had brought with him eight&nbsp;pictures of various sizes and subjects as presents from the&nbsp;infanta, and he was also commissioned to paint several portraits&nbsp;of the king and royal family. An equestrian picture of Philip&nbsp;IV., destroyed by fire in last century, became the subject of a&nbsp;poem by Lope de Vega, and the description enables us to identify&nbsp;the composition with that of a painting now in the Palazzo Pitti,&nbsp;ascribed to Velazquez.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Through a letter to Peiresc we hear of the familiar intercourse kept up between the painter and the king. Philip delighted to see Rubens at work in the studio prepared for&nbsp;him in the palace, where, he not only left many original pictures,&nbsp;but copied for his own pleasure and profit the best of Titian’s.&nbsp;An artistic event of some importance connected with the sojourn in Spain is the meeting of Rubens and Velazquez, to the&nbsp;delight, and, it may be added, advantage of both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Great as was the king’s admiration of Rubens as a painter, it seems to have been scarcely above the value attached to&nbsp;his political services. He now commissioned the painter to&nbsp;go to London as bearer of his views to Charles I., and Rubens,&nbsp;honoured with the title of secretary of the king’s privy council&nbsp;in the Netherlands, started at once on his new mission.&nbsp;Although he stopped but four days in Antwerp, he arrived&nbsp;in London just as peace had been concluded with France.&nbsp;Received by Charles with genuine pleasure, he very soon was able&nbsp;to ingratiate himself so far as to induce the king to pledge his&nbsp;royal word to take part in no undertakings against Spain so&nbsp;long as the negotiations remained unconcluded, and all the&nbsp;subsequent endeavours of France, Venice and the States found&nbsp;the king immovable in this resolution. The tardiness of the&nbsp;Spanish court in sending a regular ambassador involved the unfortunate painter in distressing anxieties, and the tone of his&nbsp;despatches is very bitter. But he speaks with the greatest&nbsp;admiration of England and the English, regretting that he&nbsp;should only have come to know the country so late. His&nbsp;popularity must have been very great, for on the 23rd of&nbsp;September 1629 the university of Cambridge conferred upon&nbsp;him the honorary degree of master of arts, and on the 21st of&nbsp;February 1630 he^was knighted, the king presenting him with&nbsp;the sword used at the ceremony, which is still preserved by the.&nbsp;descendants of the artist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although, it seems, less actively employed as an artist in Englarfd than in Spain, Rubens, besides his sketches for the&nbsp;decoration of the Banqueting Hall at Whitehall, painted the&nbsp;admirable picture of “ The Blessings of Peace ” now in the</span></p>
