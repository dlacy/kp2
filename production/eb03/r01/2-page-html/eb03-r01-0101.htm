<p><span class="font0">Sabbath. The </span><span class="font1">obſervance of the Sabbath, and deteſta-tiυn of idolatrous worſhip, are frequently inculcated together ; and, again, the breach of the Sabbath, and the worſhip of idols, are uſually reprobated at the ſame&nbsp;time. Another good reaſon for the inſtitution of a&nbsp;Sabbath might be, </span><span class="font0">to </span><span class="font1">remind the Jews of their delive-rance from bondage, to inſpire them with humanity to&nbsp;ſtrangers and domeſtics, and to mitigate the rigours of&nbsp;ſervitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The purpoſes for which the other feſtivals of the Jewiſh religion were inſtituted appear alſo of ſuſſicient&nbsp;importance. The great miracle, which, after a ſeries&nbsp;of other miracles, all directed to the ſame end, finally&nbsp;effected the deliverance of the Jews out of Egypt ; and&nbsp;their actualdeparture from that land of ſervitude, might&nbsp;well be commemorated in the feaſt of the paffover. To&nbsp;recal to the minds of poſterity the hiſtory of their anceſtors, to impreſs them with an awful and grateful ſenſe&nbsp;of the goodnefs and greatnefs of God, and to make&nbsp;them think of the purpoſes for which his almighty&nbsp;power had been ſo ſignally exerted, were ſurely good&nbsp;reaions for the inſtitution of ſucſh a feſtival. The feaſt&nbsp;of Pentecoſt celebrated the ſirſt declaration of the law&nbsp;by Moſes, in the ſpace of fifty days after the feaſt of&nbsp;the paffover. It ferved alſo as a day of folemn thankſgiving for the bleſſings of a plenteous harveſt. Οη the&nbsp;feaſt of tabernacles, they remembered the wanderings of&nbsp;their anceſtors through the wilderneſs, and expreffed&nbsp;their gratitude to heaven for the more comfortable circumſtances in which they found themſelves placed.&nbsp;The feaſt of ncw moons ſerved to fix their kalendar, and&nbsp;determine the times at which the other feſtivals were&nbsp;to be celebrated ; on it trumpets were founded, to give&nbsp;public notice of the event which was the cauſe of the&nbsp;feſtival ; no ſervile works were performed, divine fervice was carefully attended, and the firſt fruits of the&nbsp;month were offered to the Lord. The Jewiſh legiila-tor limited his feſtivals to a very fmall number, while&nbsp;the heathens devoted a confiderable part of the year to&nbsp;the celebration of theirs. But we perceive the occaſions upon which the Jewiſh feſtivals were celebrated to&nbsp;have been of ſuitable importance ; whereas thoſe of the&nbsp;heathens were often celebrated on trifling or ridiculous&nbsp;occafions. Piety and innocent recreation </span><span class="font0">ſſiared </span><span class="font1">the&nbsp;Jewiſh feſtival ; the feſtivals'of the heathens were chief</span><span class="font0">ly </span><span class="font1">devoted to debauchery and idleneſs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Hebrews had other ſolemn ſeaſons of devotion beſides the weekly Sabbath and the£e annual feſtivals.&nbsp;Every ſeventh year they reſted from labour: they were&nbsp;then neither to plough, to low, nor to prune; and what-ever the earth produced ſpontaneouſiy that year belong</span><span class="font0">ed </span><span class="font1">rather to ſtrangers, orphans, and the poor, than to&nbsp;the proprietors of the ground. Οη this year inſolvent&nbsp;debtors were diſcharged from all debts contracted by&nbsp;purchaſing the neceffaries of life : and the great end of&nbsp;this releaſe from debts contracted during the preceding&nbsp;fix years, appears to have been to prevent the Hebrew&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">from </span><span class="font1">flying to the Gentiles and forſaking his religion&nbsp;when embarraffed in his circumſtances. None but native Iſraelites and proſelytes of righteouſneſs were admitted to this privilege j it was refuſed </span><span class="font0">to </span><span class="font1">ſtrangers,&nbsp;and even to proſelytes of the gate. The jubilee was&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font1">feſtival </span><span class="font0">to </span><span class="font1">be celebrated every fiftieth year. It produced the fame effects with the ſabbatical year as to&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">reſt from labour and the diſcharge of debts </span><span class="font1">j with this&nbsp;addition, </span><span class="font0">that on the </span><span class="font1">year of the jubilee ſlaves obtained&nbsp;their freedom, and the lands reverted to the old pro-prietors. Οη the year of the jubilee, as on the ſabba»&nbsp;tical year, the lands were to reſt uncultivated, and law-ſuits were now to terminate. The chief deſign of this&nbsp;inſtitution appears to have been, to preſerve the order&nbsp;of ranks and property originally eſtabliſhed in the Hc-brew ſtate. None but iſraelites or circumciſed coq-verts could enjoy the benefit pf this inſtitution ; nor&nbsp;could even theſe hope to regain their eſtates on the&nbsp;year of the jubilee, if they fold them for any other purpoſe but to ſupply their neceſſities. The law relative&nbsp;to ufury was evidently founded on the ſame plan of&nbsp;polity with reſpect to property. To almoſt any other&nbsp;nation fuch a law, it muſt be confeffed, would have been&nbsp;unſuitable and unjuft : but as the Jews were not de-ſigned lor a trading nation, they could have little occafion to borrow, unleſs to relieve diſtreſs; and as an indulgence to people in fuch circumſtances, the Jew was&nbsp;foi bidden to exact uiury from his brother to whom he&nbsp;had lent money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Jewiſh legiflator, we may well think, would </span><span class="font0">be </span><span class="font1">diſpoſed to adopt every proper method to prevent his&nbsp;nation from tailing away into the idolatry of heathen&nbsp;nations. Probably one reaſon of the diſtinctions </span><span class="font0">be</span><span class="font1">tween </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">clean</span><span class="font1"> beaſts which they were permitted to eat,&nbsp;and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">unclean</span><span class="font1"> beaſts, the eating of which they were tarn &gt;ſht&nbsp;to conſider as pollution, was to prevent them from con-viyial intercourfe with profane nations, by which they&nbsp;might be ſeduced to idolatry. ∖Ve do not readily </span><span class="font0">ſit&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">down at table with people who are fond of diſhes which&nbsp;we regard with abhorrence. And if the Jews were&nbsp;taught to loathe the ſleſh of ſome of thofe animals which&nbsp;were among the greateſt delicacies of the Gentiles, they&nbsp;would naturally of conſequence avoid fitting down aζ&nbsp;meat with them, either at their ordinary meals or at&nbsp;thoſe entertainments which they prepared in honour of&nbsp;their deities ; and this we may with good reaſon con-ſider as one happy mean to preſerve them from idolatry· Beſides, the Jews were permitted, or rather in-joined, to eat animals which the Gentiles reverenced as&nbsp;ſacred, and from which they religiouſly witlι-lιeld alI&nbsp;violence. Goats, ſheep, and oxen, were worſhipped </span><span class="font0">in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Egypt (ſee Polytheism and Pan) ; and ſeveral learned writers are of opinion, that Moſes directed his people to ſacriſice and eat certain of the favourite animals&nbsp;of the Egyptians, in order to remove from their minds&nbsp;any opinions which they might have otherwiſe entertained oſ the ſanctity ot thole pretended deities. Many&nbsp;of the obſervances which Moſes injoined with regard to&nbsp;food, appear to have been intended to inſpire the Iſrael-ιtes with contempt for the ſuperſtitions of the people&nbsp;among whom they had fo long lojourπed∙ Fhey were&nbsp;to kill the animal which the Egyptians worſhipped; </span><span class="font0">to&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">roaſt the ſteſh which that people ate raw j to eat the&nbsp;head, which they never ate ; and to drefs the entrails,&nbsp;which they fet apart for divination. Theſe diſtinctions&nbsp;concurred with the peculiarities of their drefs, language,&nbsp;government, cuſtoms, places, and times of worſhip, and&nbsp;even the natural ſituation of their country, by which&nbsp;they were in a manner confined and fortified on all&nbsp;ſides, to ſeparate them in luch a manner from neighbouring nations, that they might eſcape the infection of&nbsp;their idolatry.
