The warp must be of woollen, not linen. Amongst the titles of the French tapestry-makers is included that of renterers. Fine drawing is particularly used for a rent or hole, which happens in dressing or preparing a piece of cloth artfully sewed up or mended with silk. All fine drawings are reckoned defects or blemishes, and should be allowed for in the price of the piece.</hi></p>
