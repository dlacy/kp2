Theſe letters, however, were intercepted by the centurion’s friends, who ſent him down a full relation of the deſign laid againſt the liberty and the honour of his only daughter. Virginius, upon this, pretending the death of a near relation, got permiffioH to leave the camp, and flew to 'Rome, inſpired with indignation and revenge. Ac-cordingly, the next day he appeared before the tribune<hi rend="sup">1</hi>,to the aftoni(hment of Appius, leading his weeping daughter by the hand, both habited in the deepeſt mourning. Claudius, the accuſer, was alſo there, and began by making his demand. Virginius next ſpoke in turn : he repreſented that his wiſe had many children ; that ſhe had been ſeen pregnant by numbers ; that, if he had intentions of adopting a ſuppoſititious child, he would have fixed upon a boy rather than a girl ; that it was notorious to all, that his wiſe had herſelf ſuckled her own child ; and that it was ſurpriſing ſſuch a claim ſhould be now revived, after a 15 years diſeontinuance. While the father ſpoke this with a ſtern air, Virginia ſtood trembling by, and, with looks of perſuaſive innocence, added Weight to all his remon-ſtrances. The people ſeemed entirely ſatisfied of the hardſhip of his caſe, till Appius, fearing what he ſaid might have dangerous effects upon the multitude, interrupted him, under a pretence of being ſufficiently inſtructed in the merits of the cauſe, and finally adjudged her to Claudius, ordering the lictors to carry her off. The lictors, in obedience to his command, ſoon drove off the throng that preſſed round the tribunal ; and now they ſeized upon Virginia, and were delivering her up into the hands of Claudius, when Virginius, who found that all was over, ſeemed to acquieſce in the ſentence. He therefore mildly intreated Appius to be permitted to take a laſt farewel of one whom he had long conſidered as his child ; and ſo ſatisfied, he would return to his duty with freſh alacrity. With this the decemvir complied, but upon condition that' their endearments ſhould paſs in his preſence. Virginius, with the moſt poignant anguiſh, took his almoſt expiring' daughter in his arms, for a while ſupported her head upon his breaft, and wiped away the tears that rolled down her lovely viſage ; and happening to be near the ſhops that ſurrounded the forum, he ſnatched up a knife that lay on the ſhambles, and buried the weapon in her breaſt ; then holding it up, reeking with the blood of his daughter, “ Appius (he cried) by this blood of innocence, I devote thy head to the infernal gods.” Thus ſaying, with the bloody knife in his hand, and threatening deſtruction to whomſoever ſhould oppoſe him, he ran through the city, wildly calling upon the people to ſtrike for freedom, and from thence went to the camp, in order to ſpread a like flame through the army.</p><p>He no ſooner arrived at the camp, followed hy a number of his friends, but he informed the army of all that was done, ſtill holding the bloody knife in his hand. He allied their pardon, and the pardon of the gods, for having committed ſo raſh an action, but af-cribed it all to the dreadful neceſſity of the times. The army, already prediſpoſed, immediately with ſhouts echoed their approbation ; and decamping, left their generals behind, to take their ſtation once more upon mount Aventine, whither they had retired about 40</p><p>years before. The other army, which had been to oppoſe the Sabines, ſeemed to feel a like reſentment, and came over in large parties to join them.</p><p>Appius, in the mean time, did all he could to quell the diſturbances in the city ; but finding the tumult incapable of controul, and perceiving that his mortal enemies, Valerius and Horatius, were the moſt active in oppoſition, at firſt attempted to find ſafety by flight; nevertheleſs, being encouraged by Oppius, who waâ one of his colleagus, he ventured to aſſemble the ſenate, and urged the puniſhment of all deſerters. The ſenate, however, were far from giving him the relief he ſought for ; they foreſaw the dangers and miſeries that threatened the ſtate, in caſe of oppoſing the incenſed army ; they therefore diſpatched meſſengers to them, offering to reſtore their former mode of government. To this propoſal all the people joyfully aſſent-ed, and the army gladly obeyed. Appius and Oppius, one of his colleagues, both died by their own hands in priſon. The other eight decemvirs went into voluntary exile ; and Claudius, the pretended maſter of Virginia, was driven out after them.</p><p>The tribunes now grew more turbulent : they propoſed two laws ; one to permit plebeians to intermarry with patricians ; and the other, to permit them to be admitted to the conſulſhip alſo. The ſenators received theſe propoſals with indignation, and ſeemed reſolved to undergo the utmoſt extremities rather than ſubmit to enact them. However, finding their reſiſtance only increaſe the commotions of the ſtate, they at laſt conſented to paſs the law concerning intermarriages, hoping that this conceſſion would ſatisfy thç. people. But they were to be appeaſed but for a very ſhort time : for, returning to their old cuſtom of refu-fing to enliſt upon the approach of an enemy, the conſuls were forced to hold a private conference with the chief of the ſenate ; where, after many debates, Claudius propoſed an expedient as the moſt probable means of ſatisfying the people in the preſent conjuncture. This was, to create fix or eight governors in the room of conſuls, whereof one half at leaſt ſhould be patricians. This project was eagerly embraced by the people ; yet ſo fickle were the multitude, that though many of the plebeians ſtood, the choice wholly fell upon the patricians who offered themſelves as candidates. Theſe new magiſtrates were called <hi rend="italic">military tribunes ;</hi>  they were at firſt but three, afterwards they were increaſed to four, and at length to fix. They had the power and enſigns of conſuls ; yet that power being divided among a number, each fingly was of leſs authority. The firſt that were choſen only continued in office about three months, the augurs having found ſomething amiſs in the ceremonies of their election.</p><p>The military tribunes being depoſed, the conſuls once more came into office ; and, in order to lighten the weight of buſineſs which they were obliged to ſuſtain, a new office was erected, namely, that of <hi rend="italic">cenſors, </hi>to be choſen every fifth year. Their buſineſs was to take an eſtimate of the number and eſtates of the people, and to diſtribute them into their proper claſſes; to inſpect into the-lives and manners of their fellow-citizens ; tö degrade ſenators for miſconduct ; to diſmount knights ; and to turn down plebeians fiom their tribes into an inferior, in caſe of miſdemeanour.
