M. Voltaire, after having obſerved that Rollin was “ the firſt member of the univerſity of Paris who wrote French with dignity and correctneſs,” ſays of this work, that “ though the laſt volumes, which were written in too great a hurry, are not equal to the firſt, it is nevertheless the heft compilation that has yet appeared in any language ; becauſe it is ſeldom that compilers are eloquent, and Rollin was remarkably ſo.” This is perhaps ſaying too much. There are indeed in this work ſome paſſages very well handled ; but they are only ſuch as he had taken from the ancient authors, in doing juſtice to whom he was always very happy. The reader will eaſily diſcover in this work the lame attachment to religion, the ſame deſire for the public good, and the ſame love of virtue, which appears in that on the Belles Lettres. But it is to be lamented that his chronology is neither exact nor correſponding ; that he ſtates facts inaccurately ; that he has not ſufficiently examined the exaggerations of ancient hiſtorians ; that he often interrupts the moſt ſolemn narrations with mere trifles ; that his ſtyle is not uniform ; and this want oſ uniformity ariſes from his borrowing from writers of a modern date 43 or 50 pages at a time. Nothing can be more noble and more reſined than his reflections; but they are ſtrewed with too ſparing a hand, and want that lively and laconic turn ort account of which the hiſtorians of antiquity are read with ſo much pleaſure. He tranſgreſſes the rule which he himſelf had eſtabliſhed in his Treatiſe on Studies. “ The precepts which have a reſpect to manners (ſays he) ought, in order to make an impreſſion, to be ſhort and lively, and pointed like a dart. That is the moſt certain method of making them enter and remain on the mind.” There is a viſible negligence in his diction with regard to grammatical cuſtom, and the choice of his expreſſions, which he does not chooſe at all times with ſufficient taſte, although, on the whole, he writes well, and has preſerved himſelf free from many of the faults of modern authors. While the laſt volumes of his ancient hiſtory were printing, he publiſhed the firſt of his Roman Hiſtory; which he lived to carry on, through the eighth and into part of the ninth, to the war againſt the Cimbri, about 70 years before the battle of Actium. Mr Crevier, the worthy diſciple of Rollin, continued the hiſtory to the battle of Actium, which cloſes the tenth volume ; and has ſince completed the original plan of Rollin in 16 vols I2mo, which was to bring it down from the foundation of the city to the reign of Conſtantinc the Great. This hiſtory had not ſo great ſucceſs as his Ancient Hiſtory had. Indeed it is rather a moral and hiſtorical diſcourſe than a formal hiſtory ; for the author does little more than point out ſome more remarkable events, while he dwells with a ſort of prolixity on thoſe parts which furniſh him a free field for moralizing. It is alternately diffuſe and barren ; and the greateſt advantage of the work is, that there are ſeveral paſſage» from T.</p><lb/><p>Livy tranſlated with great elegance into Frecch, He alſo publiſhed A Latin Tranſlation of moſt of the Theological Writings relative to the diſputes of the Time« in which he lived. Rollin was one of the moſt zealous adherents of deacon Paris ; and before the iιιclofαre of the cemetery of St Medard, this diſtinguiſhed character might have been often ſeen praying at the foot of his tomb. This he confeſſes in his Letters. He publiſhed alſo Leſſer Pieces ; containing different Letters, Latin Harangues, Diſcourſes, Complimentary Addreſſes, &amp;c. Paris 1771, 2 vols. 12mo. A collection which might have been contained in one volume, by keeping in only the beſt pieces. It is notwithſtanding valuable for ſome good pieces which it contains, for the favourable opinion which it exhibits of ſolid probity, found reaſon, and the zeal of the author ſor the progreſs of virtue and the preſervr.tion of taſte. The Latin of RoUin is very correct, and much after the Ciceronian ſtyle, and embelliſhed with moſt judicious thoughts and agreeable images. Full of the reading of the ancients,, from which he brought quotations with as much propriety as plenty’, he expreſſed himſelf with much ſpirit and excellence. His Latin poems deſerve the ſame eulo-gium.</p><p>This excellent perſon died in 1741. He had been named by the king a member of the academy of in-ſcriptions and belles lettres in 1701 : but as he had not then brought the college of Beauvais into repute, and found he had more buſineſs upon his hands than was conſiſtent with a decent attendance upon the functions of an academician, he begged the privileges of a veteran, which were honourably granted him. Nevertheleſs, he maintained his connections with the academy, attended their aſſemblies as often as he could, laid the plan of his ancient hiſtory before them, and demanded an academician for his cenſor. Rollin was a man of an admirable compoſition ; very ingenious, conſummate in polite learning, of rigid morals, and eminently pious. He was rather too religious; his religion carrying him into the territories of ſuperſtition ; and he wanted nothing but a mixture of the philoſophic in his nature to make him a very perfect character. Nothing could be more benign, more pacific, more ſweet, more moderate, than Rollin’s temper. He ſhowed, it muſt be owned, ſome zeal ſor the cauſe of Janſeniſm ; but in all other reſpects he was exceedingly moderate. The celebrated poet Rouſſeau conceived ſuch a veneration for him, that he came out of baniſhment incognito to Paris, on purpoſe to viſit him and pay his reſpects to him. He looked upon his hiſtories, not only as the beſt models of the hiſtoric kind, but as a complete ſyſtem of politics and morals, and a moſt inſtructive ſchool for princes as well as ſubjects to learn all their duties in.</p><p>Inſtead of bluſhing at the lowneſs of his birth, Rollin on no occaſion heſitated to ſpeak of it. “ It is from the Cyclops’s ſhop (ſays he, in a Latin epigram to one of his friends, to whom he had ſent a ſmall ſword) that I have taken my flight towards Parnaſſus.” He was not, however, without ſome ſhare of vanity, eſpecially at hearing mention made of his writings, of which the well-timed praiſes of his adherents had given him a veιγ high opinion. He ſpoke without any diſſimulation what he thought ; and his opinions were leſs the effect of preſumption than of openneſs of heart. He was one <hi rend="italic">of</hi>  thoſe mei» who are vain without any mixture of</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
