(c. 1499-1559) Danish reformer, the son of Jens Christensen, a curate and subsequently a canon of Viborg cathedral, and consequently, in all probability, born (c. 1499) out of wedlock, as his Catholic opponents frequently took care to remind him. He himself never used the name Sadolinus, which seems to have been invented subsequently by his son Hans, and points to the fact that the family were originally saddle-makers. We first hear of him on the 1st of December 1525, when Frederick I. permitted him to settle at Viborg to teach young persons of the poorer classes “ whatever might be profitable.” On this occasion he is described as “ magister ” and no doubt got his degree abroad, where he seems to have been won for the Reformation. He sided with Hans Tausen when the latter first began to preach the gospel at Viborg, and Tausen, though himself only in priest’s orders, shortly before he left the place, ordained Sadolin (1529). Amongst “ the free priests ” who attended the <hi rend="italic">herredag</hi> of Copenhagen in 1530 Sadolin occupied a prominent place. Frederick subse-quently transferred him to Funen, where he acted, according to his own expression, as “ adjutor in verbo ” to Knud</p><p>Gyldenstjerne, bishop of Odense. At the diocesan council held on the 27th of May 1532, during the absence of the bishop, he presented to the assembled priests a translation of Luther’s catechism, with Luther’s name omitted, preceded by an earnest plea in favour of a better system of education and a more practical application of the Christian life, which occupies a conspicuous place in the literature of the Danish Reformation. In the following year Sadolin published the first Danish translation of the Confession of Augsburg. He disappears during the troublous times of “ C’-revens Fejde ” (1533-1536), though we get a glimpse of him at the end of 1536 as one of the preachers at <hi rend="italic">Vor Frue Kirke,</hi> the principal church of Copenhagen. On the 2nd of September 1537 he was consecrated by the German reformer, Johann Bugenhagen, who himself only had priest’s orders, superintendent, or first evangelical bishop, of Funen. As bishop he was remarkable for the success with which he provided the necessary means for the support of churches, schools and hospitals in his widespread diocese, which had been deprived of its usual sources of income by the wholesale con-fiscation of church property. Towards the Catholics he adopted a firm, but moderate and reasonable, tone, and his indulgence towards the monks in St Knud’s cloister drew down upon him a fierce attack from the Puritan clergyman of Odense, who absurdly accused him of being a crypto-Catholic. He gave the funeral oration over Christian III. in St John’s Church at Odense in February 1559, though now very infirm and blind, and died at the end of the same year.</p><p>See Bricka, <hi rend="italic">Dansk Biografish Lx.
