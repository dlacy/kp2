<p><label>RHODOCHROSITE</label>
a mineral species consisting of manganese carbonate, MnCO <hi rend="sub">s</hi> , crystallizing in the rhombohedral system and isomorphous with calcite. It usually occurs as cleavable, compact or botryoidal masses, distinct crystals being somewhat rare; these often have the form ,of thé primitive rhombohedron, parallel to the faces of which there are perfect cleavages. When pure, the mineral contains 47*7% of manganese, but this is usually partly replaced by varying amounts of iron, and sometimes -by calcium, magnesium, zinc, or rarely cobalt (cobalt-manganese-spar). With these variations in chemical composition the specific gravity varies from 3-45 to 3-60; the hardness is 4. The coloqr is usually rose-red, but may sometimes be grey to brown. The name rhodochrosite, from the Greek <hi rend="italic">ρόδο-χρως</hi> (rose-coloured), has reference to the characteristic , colour of the mineral : manganese-spar and dialogite are synonyms. ‘ It is found in mineral veins with ores of silver, lead, copper,- &amp;c., or in deposits of manganese ore. Crystals have beep met with in the mines at Kapnik-Banya and Nagyâg near :Déva in Transylvania and at Diez in Nassau, but by far the best specimens are from Colorado. The mineral is used to a limited extent in the manufacture of spiegeleisen and ferromanganese.</p>
