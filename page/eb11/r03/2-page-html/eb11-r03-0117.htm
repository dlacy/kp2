In July he succeeded Sir Donald Stewart as commander-in-chief in India, and during his seven years’&nbsp;tenure of this high position instituted many measures for the&nbsp;benefit of the army, and greatly assisted the development of&nbsp;frontier communications and defence. At the end of 1886, at&nbsp;the request of the viceroy, he took personal command for a&nbsp;time of the forces in Burma, and organized measures for the&nbsp;suppression of dacoity. For his services he received the medal,&nbsp;was created G.C.I.E., and promoted supernumerary general.&nbsp;In 1890 he did the honours of the army to Prince Albert Victor&nbsp;at a standing camp at Muridki, and in 1891 his attention was&nbsp;occupied with the Zhob and Hunza Nagar frontier campaigns.&nbsp;On the ist of January 1892 he was raised to the peerage as&nbsp;Baron Roberts of Kandahar and Waterford. In 1893 he left&nbsp;India for good, and the G.C.S.I. was bestowed upon him. He&nbsp;was promoted to be field-marshal in 1895, and in the autumn&nbsp;of that year succeeded Lord Wolseley in the Irish command&nbsp;and was sworn a privy councillor. At Queen Victoria’s diamond&nbsp;jubilee in 1897 he was created K.P.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After the disastrous actions in the Boer war in South Africa in December 1S99 at Magersfontein, Stormberg and Colenso,&nbsp;where his only son was killed, Lord Roberts was sent out as&nbsp;commander-in-chief. He arrived at Cape Town on the 10th&nbsp;of January 1900, and after organizing his force, advanced with&nbsp;sound strategy on Bloemfontein, the capital of the Orange&nbsp;Free State, and soon changed the aspect of affairs. The sieges&nbsp;of Kimberley and Ladysmith were raised, and the Boer general,&nbsp;Cronje, flying towards the capital, was overtaken at Paardeberg&nbsp;and, after a fine defence, compelled to surrender, with 5000 men,&nbsp;on the anniversary of Majuba Day, the 27th of February 1900.&nbsp;Roberts entered Bloemfontein on the 13th of March, and after&nbsp;six weeks’ preparation, advanced on Pretoria, the capital of&nbsp;the Transvaal. Mafeking was relieved on the 17th of May,&nbsp;and Pretoria occupied on the 5th of June. The two Boer states&nbsp;were annexed, and the war gradually assuming a guerilla&nbsp;character, Roberts handed over the command to Lord Kitchener&nbsp;and returned to England to fill the office of commander-in-chief&nbsp;of the army in succession to Lord Wolseley.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He arrived in the Solent on the 2nd of January 1901, and the same day, at Osborne, had an audience of Queen Victoria,&nbsp;who handed him the insignia of the Order of the Garter. The&nbsp;next day he was received at Paddington by the prince and&nbsp;princess of Wales, and drove in procession to Buckingham&nbsp;Palace, where he was entertained as the guest of the queen.&nbsp;He again had an audience of the queen at Osborne on the 14th&nbsp;of January on his elevation to an earldom, the last audience&nbsp;given by her majesty before her death, which took place eight&nbsp;days later. When the German emperor came to London for&nbsp;the queen’s funeral, he decorated Lord Roberts with the Order&nbsp;of the Black Eagle. Earl Roberts received the thanks of both&nbsp;Houses of Parliament and a grant of £100,000 for his services&nbsp;in South Africa. In 1905 he resigned his post on the Committee&nbsp;of National Defence, and devoted himself to attempting to&nbsp;rouse his countrymen to the necessity of cultivating rifleshooting and of adopting systematic general military training&nbsp;and service. As an author he is known by his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rise of Wellington</span><span class="font1"> (1895), and his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Forty-One Years in India</span><span class="font1"> (1897), an autobiography which has passed through numerous editions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROBERTSON, FREDERICK WILLIAM (1816-1853), English divine, known as Robertson of Brighton, was born in London&nbsp;on the 3rd of February 1816. The first five years of his life&nbsp;were passed at Leith Fort, where his father, a captain in the&nbsp;Royal Artillery, was then resident. The military spirit entered&nbsp;into his blood, and throughout life he was characterized by&nbsp;the qualities of the ideal soldier. In 1821 Captain Robertson&nbsp;retired to Beverley, where the boy was educated. At the age&nbsp;of fourteen he spent a year at Tours, from which he returned&nbsp;to Scotland and continued his education at the Edinburgh&nbsp;Academy and university. In 1834 he was articled to a solicitor&nbsp;in Bury St Edmunds, but the uncongenial and sedentary&nbsp;employment soon broke down his health. He was anxious&nbsp;for a military career, and his name was placed upon the list&nbsp;of the 3rd Dragoons, then serving in India. For two years he&nbsp;worked hard in preparing for the army, but, by a singular&nbsp;conjunction of circumstances and at the sacrifice of his own&nbsp;natural bent to his father’s wish, he matriculated at Brasenose&nbsp;College, Oxford, just two weeks before his commission was&nbsp;put into his hands. Oxford he did not find wholly congenial&nbsp;to his intensely earnest spirit, but he read hard, and, as he&nbsp;afterwards said, “ Plato, Aristotle, Butler, Thucydides, Sterne,&nbsp;Jonathan Edwards, passed like the iron atoms of the blood&nbsp;into my mental constitution.” At the same time he made a&nbsp;careful study of the Bible, committing to memory the entire&nbsp;New Testament both in English and in Greek. The Tractarian&nbsp;movement had no attraction for him, although he admired&nbsp;some of its leaders. He was at this time a moderate Calvimst&nbsp;in doctrine, and enthusiastically evangelical. Ordained in&nbsp;July 1840 by the bishop of Winchester, he at once entered on&nbsp;ministerial work in that city, and during his ministry there&nbsp;and under the influence of the missionaries Henry Martyn and&nbsp;David Brainerd, whose lives he studied, he carried devotional&nbsp;asceticism to an injurious length. In less than a year he was&nbsp;compelled to seek'relaxation; and going to Switzerland he&nbsp;there met and married Helen, third daughter of Sir George&nbsp;William Denys, Bart. Early in 1842, after a few months*&nbsp;rest, he accepted a curacy in Cheltenham, which he retained&nbsp;for upwards of four years. The questioning spirit was first&nbsp;aroused in him by the disappointing fruit of evangelical doctrine&nbsp;which he found in Cheltenham, as well as by intimacy with&nbsp;men of varied reading. But, if we are to judge from his own&nbsp;statement in a letter from Heidelberg in 1846, the doubts&nbsp;which now actively assailed him had long been latent in his&nbsp;mind. The crisis of his mental conflict had just been passed&nbsp;in Tirol, and he was now beginning to let his creed grow again&nbsp;from the one fixed point which nothing had availed to shift:&nbsp;“ The one great certainty to which, in the midst of the darkest&nbsp;doubt, I never ceased to cling—the entire symmetry and&nbsp;loveliness and the unequalled nobleness of the humanity of&nbsp;the Son of Man.” After this mentaI revolution he felt unahle&nbsp;to return to Cheltenham, but after doing duty for two months&nbsp;at St Ebbe’s, Oxford, he entered in August 1847 θ<sup>η</sup> his famous&nbsp;ministry at Trinity Chapel, Brighton. Here he stepped at&nbsp;once into the foremost rank as a preacher, and his church was&nbsp;thronged with thoughtful men of all classes in society and of&nbsp;all shades of religious belief. His fine appearance, his flexible&nbsp;and sympathetic voice, his manifest sincerity, the perfect&nbsp;lucidity and artistic symmetry of his address, and the brilliance&nbsp;with which he illustrated his points would have attracted&nbsp;hearers even had he had little to say. But he had much to&nbsp;say. He was not, indeed, a scientific theologian; hut his insight into the principles of the Spiritutal life was unrivalled.&nbsp;As his biographer says, thousands found in his.sermons “a&nbsp;living source of impulse, a practical direction of thought, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">key to many of the problems of theology, and above all a path&nbsp;to spiritual freedom.” His closing years were full of sadness.&nbsp;His sensitive nature was subjected to extreme suffering, arising&nbsp;mainly from the opposition aroused by his sympathy with&nbsp;the revolutionary ideas of the 1848 epoch. Moreover, he was&nbsp;crippled by incipient disease of the brain, which at first inflicted unconquerable lassitude and depression, and latterly&nbsp;agonizing pain. On the 5th of June 1853 he preached for the&nbsp;last time, and on the 15th of August he died.</span></p>
