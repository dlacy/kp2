                <p><label>SALESBURY (or Salisbury), WILLIAM</label> (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>.
                    1520- <hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 1600), Welsh scholar, was a native of
                    Denbighshire, being the son of Foulke Salesbury, who belonged to a family said
                    to be descended from a certain Adam of Salzburg, a member of the ducal house of
                    Bavaria, who came to England in the 12th century. Salesbury was educated at
                    Oxford, where he accepted the Protestant</p>

                <p>faith, but he passed most of his life at Llanrwst, working at his literary
                    undertakings. The greatest Welsh scholar of his time, Salesbury was acquainted
                    with nine languages, including Latin, Greek and Hebrew, and was learned in
                    philology and botany. He died about 1600. About 1546 he edited a collection of
                    Welsh proverbs (<hi rend="italic">Oll synwyr pen kembero),</hi> probably the
                    first book printed in Welsh, and in 1547 his <hi rend="italic">Dictionary in
                        Englyshe and Welshe</hi> was published (facsimile edition, 1877). In 1563
                    the English parliament ordered the Welsh bishops to arrange for the translation
                    of the Scriptures and the book of common prayer into Welsh. The New Testament
                    was assigned to Salesbury, who had previously translated parts of it. He
                    received valu-able assistance from Richard Davies, bishop of St Davids, and also
                    from Thomas Huet, or Hewett (d. 1591), but he himself did the greater part of
                    the work. The translation was made from the Greek, but Latin versions were
                    consulted, and in October 1567 the New Testament was published for the first
                    time in Welsh. This translation never became very popular, but it served as the
                    basis for the new one made by Bishop William Morgan (c. 1547-1604). Salesbury
                    and Davies continued to work together, translating various writings into Welsh,
                    until about 1576 when the literary partnership was broken. After this event,
                    Salesbury, although continuing his studies, produced nothing of importance.</p>
                <p>Other noteworthy members of the family (the modern spelling is Salusbury) are:
                    John Salesbury (<hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps">c</hi></hi>
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">. 1500-1573), who held many preferments under the Tudor
                        sovereigns and was bishop of Sodor and Man from 1571 to 1573; Thomas

                    <hi rend="smallcaps">. I555-1586), an associate of Anthony Babington, who was
                        executed for conspiring against Queen Elizabeth; Henry Salesbury (1561-</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 1637), the author of a Welsh grammar published in
                    1593; Thomas Salesbury (d. 1643), a poet, who probably fought for Charles I. at
                    Edgehill; and another royalist, William Salesbury (c. 1580-c. 1659), governor of
                    Denbigh Castle, which, in 1646, he gallantly defended in the interests of the
                    king.</p>
