<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Reimarus’s reputation as a classical and historical scholar rests on the valuable edition of Dio Cassius (1750-52)&nbsp;which he prepared from the. materials collected by his&nbsp;father-in-law, J. A. Fabricius. In the department of&nbsp;philosophy he published a work on logic ( </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vernunftlehre als&nbsp;Anweisung zum richtigen Gebrauche der Vernunft,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1756,&nbsp;fifth edition 1790), and two very popular books bearing&nbsp;on the great religious questions of the day. The first of&nbsp;these works was a collection of essays on the principal&nbsp;truths of natural religion </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Abhandlungen von den vornehmsten Wahrheiten der natürlichen Religion</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">, 1754, 6th ed.&nbsp;1791) ־ the second (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Betrachtungen über die Kunsttriebe der&nbsp;Thiere,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1762, 4th ed. 1798) dealt with one particular&nbsp;branch of the same subject. In these works he appears as&nbsp;a powerful opponent of French materialism and Spinoza’s&nbsp;pantheism, a zealous teleologist and able wielder of the&nbsp;ai’gument from design. His philosophical position is&nbsp;essentially that of Christian Wolff. But it is the work&nbsp;(carefully kept back during his lifetime, strangely enough)&nbsp;from which Lessing published certain chapters after the&nbsp;author’s death with which his name is most widely associated. Lessing’s relation to this work has been stated in&nbsp;the article </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Lessing. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Its title in the MS. is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Apologie oder&nbsp;Schutzschrift für die vernünftigen Verehrer Gottes.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> The&nbsp;original MS. is in the Hamburg town library </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> a copy was&nbsp;made for the university library of Göttingen, 1814, and&nbsp;other copies are known to exist. In addition to the seven&nbsp;fragments published by Lessing, a second portion of the&nbsp;work was issued in 1787 by C. A. E. Schmidt (a pseudonym), under the title </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">TJebrige noch ungedruckte Werke des&nbsp;Wolfenbüttelschen Fragmentisten,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and a further portion by&nbsp;D. W. Klose in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">JViedner’s Zeitschrift für historische Theologie</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">, 1850-52. Two of the five books of the first part&nbsp;and the whole of the second part, as well as appendices&nbsp;on the canon, remain still, and will probably always remain,&nbsp;unprinted. But D. F. Strauss has given an exhaustive&nbsp;analysis of the whole work in his book on Reimarus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The standpoint of Reimarus in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Apologie</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> is that of pure naturalistic deism. Miracles and mysteries are denied, and natural religion is put forward as the absolute contradiction of revealed.&nbsp;The essential truths of the former are the existence of a wise and&nbsp;good Creator and the doctrine of the immortality of the soul. These&nbsp;truths are discoverable by reason, and are such as can constitute the&nbsp;basis of a univei'sal and rational religion. A revealed religion could&nbsp;never obtain universality, as it could never be made intelligible&nbsp;and credible to all men. Even supposing its possibility, the Bible&nbsp;does not present such a revelation. It abounds in error as to&nbsp;matters of fact, contradicts human experience, reason, and morals,&nbsp;and is one tissue of folly, deceit, enthusiasm, selfishness, and crime.&nbsp;Moreover, it is not a doctrinal compendium, or catechism, which a&nbsp;revelation would have to be. What the Old Testament says of the&nbsp;worship of God is little, and that little worthless, while its writers&nbsp;are unacquainted with the second fundamental truth of religion,&nbsp;the immortality of the soul. The design of the writers of the&nbsp;New Testament, as well as that of Jesus, was not to teach true&nbsp;rational religion, but to serve their own selfish ambitions, in promoting which Reimarus makes them exhibit an inconceivable&nbsp;combination of conscious fraud and enthusiasm. With all his&nbsp;acuteness as a rationalistic critic, and the destructive force of his&nbsp;attack upon the old orthodox conception of the nature of the Bible&nbsp;and revelation, Reimarus must be regarded simply as the classical&nbsp;representative of rationalism in its absolute inability to form any&nbsp;remotely just conception of God, religion, revelation, the Bible, and&nbsp;Christianity. His </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Apologie</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> is the historical monument to the incapacity of rationalism with regard to philosophy, religion, and&nbsp;true historical and literary criticism. By the higher and profounder&nbsp;ideas and historical insight of Lessing, Herder, Semler, Kant, and&nbsp;Schleiermacher, his entire position was rendered antiquated, and the&nbsp;permanently valid portions of his criticism of the Bible are of value&nbsp;only as destructive of a theory, now outlived, of it and religion.&nbsp;But as a learned, acute, and logical assailant of that theory he&nbsp;must be honoured with a place amongst the pioneers of truer views&nbsp;of both.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REINAUD, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Joseph Toussaint </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(1795-1867), a distinguished French Orientalist, was born in 1795 at Lambesc, Bouches du Rhône, and began to study for the church,&nbsp;but, being drawn towards Eastern learning, he came to Paris&nbsp;in 1815 and became a pupil of Silvestre de Sacy. In 1818&nbsp;and the following year he was at Rome as an attache to the&nbsp;French minister, and studied under the Maronites of the&nbsp;Propaganda, but gave special attention to Mohammedan&nbsp;coins. In 1824 he entered the department of Oriental&nbsp;MSS. in the Royal Library at Paris, and in 1838, on the&nbsp;death of De Sacy, he succeeded to his chair in the school&nbsp;of living Oriental languages. In 1847 he became president of the Société Asiatique, and in 1858 conservator of&nbsp;Oriental MSS. in the Imperial Library. In all these functions Reinaud maintained the great reputation of the&nbsp;French Oriental school, ·and he also did good service with&nbsp;his pen. His first important work was his classical description of the collections of the Duc de Blacas (1828). To&nbsp;history he contributed an essay on the Arab invasions&nbsp;of France, Savoy, Piedmont, and Switzerland (1836), and&nbsp;various collections for the period of the crusades ; he&nbsp;edited (1840) andin part translated (1848) the geography&nbsp;of Abulfeda; to him too is due a useful edition of the very&nbsp;curious records of early Arabic intercourse with China of&nbsp;which Renaudot had given but an imperfect translation&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Relation des Voyages</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">, &amp;c., 1845) and various other essays&nbsp;illustrating the ancient and mediaeval geography of the&nbsp;East. His chief quality was indefatigable industry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REINHOLD, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Karl Leonhard </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(1758-1823), who played a considerable part in the early spread and development of the Kantian philosophy, was born at Vienna in&nbsp;1758. At the age of fourteen he entered the Jesuit&nbsp;College of St Anna with the intention of becoming a&nbsp;priest of the order. The order was dissolved by the pope&nbsp;in the following year ; but young Reinhold, being full of&nbsp;Catholic and monastic zeal, joined a similar college of the&nbsp;order of St Barnabas in 1774. There he remained nine&nbsp;years, before the end of which his scientific and philosophic&nbsp;studies had completely estranged him from the life and&nbsp;aims of the cloister. In 1783 he fled to North Germany,&nbsp;and settled in Weimar, where he became Wieland’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">collaborateur</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> on the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">German Mercury,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and eventually his&nbsp;son-in-law. In the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">German Mercury</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> he published, in the&nbsp;years 1786-87, his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Briefe über die Kantische Philosophie,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">which, by their clear and eloquent exposition were most&nbsp;important in making Kant known to a wider circle of&nbsp;readers. Reinhold himself had read the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Critique</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> five&nbsp;times without a single ray of light ; in the end it was&nbsp;the ethical side of the system by which he found himself attracted and convinced. As a result of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Letters,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Reinhold at once received a call to the neighbouring&nbsp;university of Jena, where he taught from 1787 to 1794,&nbsp;and largely contributed to make Jena, after Königsberg,&nbsp;the second home of the Kantian philosophy. In 1789&nbsp;he published his chief work, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Versuch einer neuen&nbsp;Theorie des menschlichen Vorstellungsvermögens,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> in which&nbsp;he attempted to simplify the Kantian theory and make it&nbsp;more of a unity. In 1794 he accepted a call to Kiel, but&nbsp;his departure from Jena marks the zenith of his reputation. He taught at Kiel till his death in 1823, but his&nbsp;independent activity was at an end. His essentially&nbsp;receptive and impressible nature yielded first to the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
