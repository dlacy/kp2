<p><label>RONDA</label>
a town of Spain, in the province of Malaga, and about 43 miles to the west of that city. It occupies a site of singular picturesqueness on a high rock nearly surrounded by the Guadalvin (afterwards the Guadiaro), which flows through a deep and abrupt chasm (or “ Tajo ”) by which the old town is separated from the new. Of the two bridges the more modern (1761) spans the stream in a single arch at a height of about 255 feet. On the edge of the Tajo is the alameda or public promenade, commanding a wide and beautiful prospect of the fertile valley or vega and the sierra beyond. The old part of the town has a Moorish aspect, with narrow, steep, and crooked lanes, and still retains some Moorish towers and other buildings. The Ronda bull-ring is one of the finest in Spain, and can accommodate 10,000 spectators. Ronda is the seat of a considerable trade in leather, saddlery, and horses, and has an important fair (May 20). The population within the limits of the municipality was 19,181 in 1877.</p><p>Some inconsiderable remains of an aqueduct and theatre, about 7 miles to the north of Ronda, are supposed to represent the <hi rend="italic">Acinipo</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Arunda</hi> of ancient geographers. Ronda was taken from the Moors in 1485. It was the birthplace of Espinel.</p>
