a mathematical inſtrument conſiſting of ſeveral lines drawn on wood, braſs, ſilver, &amp;c. and variouſly divided, according to the purpoſes it is intended to ſerve; whence it acquires various denominations, as the <hi rend="italic">plain ſcale, diagonal ſcale, plotting ſcale,</hi> &amp;c. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Geometry.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sc ale,</hi> in muſic, ſometimes denominated a <hi rend="italic">gamut,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">diagram</hi>, a <hi rend="italic">ſeries,</hi> an <hi rend="italic">order,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">diapaſon.</hi> It conſiſts of the regular gradations of found, by which a compoſer or performer, whether in riſing or deſcending, may paſs from any given tune to another. Theſe gradations are ſeven. When this order is repeated, the firſt note of the ſecond is conſentaneous with the loweſt note of the firſt; the ſecond of the former with the ſecond of the latter; and ſo through the whole octave. The ſecond order, therefore, is juſtly eſteemed only a repetition of the firſt. For this reaſon the ſcale, among the moderns, is ſometimes limited to an octave; at other times extended to the compaſs of any particular voice or inſtrument. It likewiſe frequently includes all the practical gradations of muſical found, or the whole number of octaves employed in compoſition or execution, arranged in their natural order.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
