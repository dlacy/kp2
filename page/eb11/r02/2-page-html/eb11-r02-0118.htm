<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vulgaris,</span><span class="font0"> 4 or 5 in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anolis,</span><span class="font0"> to 1-3 in some other iguanids, skinks and geckos. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Uroplates fimbriates</span><span class="font0"> has 14, and the last four&nbsp;pairs are separated from the dorsal portions of their ribs;&nbsp;similar discontinuity occurs in geckos, the median portions&nbsp;bearing a striking, although not fundamental, resemblance to&nbsp;parasternal ribs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the lizards with much reduced fore limbs, the sternum loses its connexion with the ribs from behind forwards; two&nbsp;sternal ribs existing in the Tejid&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ophiodes</span><span class="font0"> and in the Scincoid&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Acontias,</span><span class="font0"> one only in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pygopus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">none in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ophisaurus</span><span class="font0"> s. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pseudopus</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anguis</span><span class="font0"> (in the latter one&nbsp;rib is still connected in the&nbsp;embryo). The sternum is likewise quite free in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chirotes</span><span class="font0"> in spite&nbsp;of its functional limbs; the sternum is still a large plate, with</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">a window, and ending in two long, xiphoid processes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Lastly, the sternum has vanished without a trace, as in the snakes, in some species of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Acontias,</span><span class="font0"> in the Anelytropidae,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dibamus</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aniella</span><span class="font0"> (Fürbringer). In the limbless genera&nbsp;of Amphisbaenidae the sternum is very much reduced; in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Trogonophis</span><span class="font0"> alone it is still represented by a narrow transverse bar connecting the ossicular vestiges of the shoulder-girdle;&nbsp;in the other genera the sternum has shrunk to a pair of&nbsp;nodules or to a single nodule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pectoral</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">shoulder-girdle</span><span class="font0"> in its completest condition consists of a right and left scapula, coracoid, precoracoid and&nbsp;clavicles, and an unpaired interclavicle or episternum. The&nbsp;dorsal portion of the scapula remains cartilaginous, with or&nbsp;without calcification, and is usually distinguished as supra-scapula. The ventral portion of the precoracoidal and cora-coidal mass remains likewise more or less cartilaginous, rather&nbsp;unnecessarily distinguished as epicoracoid. Ossification begins&nbsp;near the glenoid cavity and thence spreads, eventually with&nbsp;thc formation of a dorsal and a ventral centre. The resulting&nbsp;suture separates the dorsal or scapular from the ventral or&nbsp;coraco-precoracoidal mass. A kind of landmark, not always&nbsp;reliable, between coracoid and precoracoid is the exit of the&nbsp;supra-coracoidal nerve. The ventral margins of the coracoids&nbsp;articulate in tenon and mortice fashion with the antero-lateral&nbsp;margins of the sternum. The interclavicle, usually T-shaped,&nbsp;is a dermal bone and rests upon the ventral side of the girdle.&nbsp;The paired clavicles, sometimes fused together, rest upon the&nbsp;anterior end of the inter clavicle and extend transversely to the&nbsp;acromial process of the scapula; the detail of the attachments&nbsp;varies much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The girdle is most complete in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font0"> and in Lacertilia. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font0"> the coracoid forms one continuous mass with&nbsp;the precoracoid, without further differentiation; the clavicles&nbsp;are fused with the interclavicle into one T-shaped mass, the&nbsp;cross-arms of which are attached to the acromia by ligaments.&nbsp;In the lizards (except </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Heloderma)</span><span class="font0"> the much-broadened central&nbsp;and anterior halves of the girdle are fenestrated; the windows,&nbsp;always closed by membranes, are bordered by bony processes,&nbsp;distally by unossified cartilage. The first window to appear,&nbsp;or the most constant, lies between the coracoid and its precoracoid; in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anguis</span><span class="font0"> it is the only window, in this case not a&nbsp;primary feature. In other lizards, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. Uromastix,</span><span class="font0"> a second&nbsp;window occurs between precoracoid and scapula, and even&nbsp;a third window can appear in the scapula itself, causing in&nbsp;many Iguanidae, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. Amblyrhynchus</span><span class="font0"> (see fig. 33, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ms.),</span><span class="font0"> the so-called mesoscapula; an analogous window within the coracoid&nbsp;produces the mesocoracoid; unnecessary distinctions of little&nbsp;morphological value considering the great variability of these&nbsp;fenestrations in closely allied genera.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The chameleons have lost the clavicles and the interclavicle, and the scapula, which is very slender and long, is devoid of&nbsp;an acromial process. The coracoid forms one mass with the&nbsp;precoracoid, through the middle of which /passes the supra-coracoidal nerve; the coracoids articulate by their whole&nbsp;bases with the sternum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Geckos possess a complete shoulder-girdle; the ventral portion shows, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. Hemidactylus,</span><span class="font0"> three pairs of windows; only one in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Uroplatcs.</span><span class="font0"> In the latter the interclavicle is much reduced; the clavicles meet each other and are slender rods.&nbsp;In the Geckoninae and Eublepharinae the ventral halves of&nbsp;the clavicles are dilated and possess each a foramen; the interclavicle is cross-shaped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the more or less limbless genera of lizards the shoulder-girdle is much reduced. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chirotcs,</span><span class="font0"> which still has functional fore limbs, the clavicles and the interclavicle are absent, the&nbsp;coracoids are not divided from the precoracoids; in the limbless Amphisbaenidae the girdle is reduced to a pair of cylindrical&nbsp;ossicles in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Amphisbaena, Blanus</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Trogonophis',</span><span class="font0"> no vestiges&nbsp;exist in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhincura, Lepidostcrnon</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Foramina in the broadened clavicles occur also in various Lacertae, for instance in the Iguanid </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Laemanctus,</span><span class="font0"> in the Scin-coid </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Trachysaurus,</span><span class="font0"> in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Plestiodon, Zonosaurus</span><span class="font0"> and in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lacerta&nbsp;simonyi,</span><span class="font0"> but not in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">L. agilis.</span><span class="font0"> In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mabnia</span><span class="font0"> the median portions&nbsp;are especially broad and show each two foramina. Their presence can be of but very doubtful taxonomic value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The girdle of the Crocodiles is considerably simplified. Scapula and coracoidae, movably united, at least in younger&nbsp;specimens. The precoracoid is slightly indicated by a process&nbsp;of the coracoid, which is perforated by the supra-coracoidal&nbsp;nerve near the glenoid cavity. Clavicles are absent. The&nbsp;interclavicle is reduced to a long, fiat splint-bone, which is&nbsp;firmly fused on to the sternal cartilage. The Chelonian shoulder-girdle shows several very remarkable modifications. Instead&nbsp;of lying outside the trunk, it has been transferred into the cavity&nbsp;of the trunk, the carapace with the ribs covering it from the&nbsp;outside. An explanation of the changes implied in this transposition is still extant. Chelomans are, moreover, the only&nbsp;reptiles besides Pterosauria in which the scapula is attached&nbsp;to the skeleton of the trunk. The scapulae stand in a more&nbsp;or less vertical position, and their dorsal end rests against the&nbsp;inside of the nuchal plate, where this is sutured to the first&nbsp;neural and the first costal plate, a little in front of and sidewards from the first short rib. From near its ventral end the&nbsp;scapula sends oit a long process, which converges transversely&nbsp;with its fellow. This process, the clavicle(J) or the precoracoid of many authors, is the acromial process, the Plesiosauri&nbsp;giving the clue as to how an acromion can assume such an&nbsp;abnormal position. The coracoid, with a suture between it&nbsp;and the scapula, is very long and extends horizontally backwards, not meeting that of the other side.
