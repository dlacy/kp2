<p><span class="font2">ROSCOE, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">William</span><span class="font2"> (1753-1831), historian and miscellaneous writer, was born March 8, 1753, at Ijverpool, where his father, who was a market gardener, kept the&nbsp;public house known as the Bowling Green at Mount&nbsp;Pleasant. Young Roscoe showed an early eagerness in the&nbsp;acquisition of knowledge, and at twelve he left school,&nbsp;having learned all that his schoolmaster could teach. He&nbsp;now assisted his father in the work of the garden, and&nbsp;gave his leisure hours to reading and study. “This mode&nbsp;of life,” he says, “ gave health and vigour to my body, and&nbsp;amusement and instruction to my mind ; and to this day&nbsp;I well remember the delicious sleep which succeeded my&nbsp;labours, from which I was again called at an early hour.&nbsp;If I were now asked whom I consider to be the happiest of&nbsp;the human race, I should answer, those who cultivate the&nbsp;earth by their own hands.” At fifteen it was necessary to&nbsp;decide upon a path in life. A month’s trial of bookselling&nbsp;sufficed to disgust him, and in 1769 he was articled to a&nbsp;solicitor, on whose death he was transferred to the office of&nbsp;Peter Ellames, who had more than a local reputation.&nbsp;Although a diligent student of law, he did not bid farewell&nbsp;to the Muses, but continued to read the classics, and made&nbsp;that acquaintance with the language and literature of Italy&nbsp;which became the instrument of his distinction in after life.&nbsp;He wrote many verses : his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mount Pleasant</span><span class="font2"> was composed&nbsp;when he was sixteen, and this and similar compositions,&nbsp;though now forgotten, won the esteem of good critics. In&nbsp;1774 he commenced business as an attorney, and as soon&nbsp;as his professional gains warranted he married (1781).&nbsp;His sympathies were attracted to the miseries of the&nbsp;victims of the African slave trade, and he had the courage&nbsp;to denounce it in his native town, where not a little of the&nbsp;wealth came from this source. He wrote the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Wrongs of&nbsp;Africa</span><span class="font2"> (1787-88), and entered into a controversy with an&nbsp;apostate Roman Catholic priest, who undertook to prove&nbsp;the “ licitness of the slave trade ” from the Bible. Roscoe&nbsp;was also a political pamphleteer, and like many other&nbsp;Liberals of the day hailed the promise of liberty in the&nbsp;French Revolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Meanwhile he had steadily pursued his Italian studies, and had made extensive collections relating to the great&nbsp;ruler of Florence. The result was his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Life of Lorenzo dd&nbsp;Medici, called the Magnificent,</span><span class="font2"> which appeared in 1796,&nbsp;and at once placed him in the front rank of contemporary&nbsp;historians. The first edition was produced at Liverpool&nbsp;by John M<sup>c</sup>Creery, an elegant printer who had settled&nbsp;there by Roscoe’s encouragement. Soon after the appearance of the book, Cadell &lt;fe Davis bought the copyright for £1200. The work has often been reprinted,&nbsp;and translations in French, German, and other languages&nbsp;show that its popularity was not confined to its author’s&nbsp;native land. Perhaps the most gratifying testimony was&nbsp;that of Fabroni, who had intended to translate his own&nbsp;Latin life of Lorenzo, but abandoned the design and induced Gaetano Mecherini to undertake an Italian version&nbsp;of Roscoe instead. In 1796 Roscoe gave up practice as&nbsp;an attorney, and had some thought of going to the bar,&nbsp;but abandoned the idea after keeping a single term.&nbsp;Between 1793 and 1800 he gave much attention to&nbsp;agriculture, and was one of those who helped to reclaim&nbsp;Chat Moss, near Manchester. He also succeeded in restoring to good order the affairs of a banking house in&nbsp;which his friend William Clark, then resident in Italy,&nbsp;was a partner. This task led to his introduction to the&nbsp;business, which eventually proved disastrous. His translation of Tansillo’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nurse</span><span class="font2"> appeared in 1798, and went&nbsp;through several editions. It is dedicated in a sonnet to&nbsp;his wife, who had practised the precepts of the Italian,&nbsp;poet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Life and Pontificate of Leo the Tenth</span><span class="font2"> appeared in 1805, and was a natural sequel to that by which he had&nbsp;made his reputation. For one half of the copyright he&nbsp;received £2000 from Cadell &amp; Davis. The work, whilst&nbsp;it maintained its author’s fame, did not, on the whole,&nbsp;meet with so favourable a reception as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Life of Lorenzo.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">It has been frequently reprinted, and the insertion of the&nbsp;Italian translation in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Index</span><span class="font2"> did not prevent its circulation even in the papal states. Roscoe was elected member&nbsp;of parliament for Liverpool in 1806, but the House of&nbsp;Commons was not a congenial place, and at the dissolution&nbsp;in the following year he declined to be again a candidate.&nbsp;The commercial troubles of 1816 brought into difficulties&nbsp;the banking house with which he was connected, and&nbsp;forced the sale of his collection of books and pictures. It&nbsp;was on this occasion that he wrote the fine </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sonnet an&nbsp;Parting with his Books.</span><span class="font2"> After a five years’ struggle to&nbsp;discharge the liabilities of the bank, the action of a small&nbsp;number of creditors forced the partners into bankruptcy in&nbsp;1820. For a time Roscoe was in danger of arrest, but&nbsp;ultimately he received an honourable discharge. On the&nbsp;dispersal of his library, the volumes most useful to him&nbsp;were secured by friends and placed in the Liverpool&nbsp;Athenæum, where they still remain. The sum of £2500&nbsp;was also invested for his benefit. The independent and&nbsp;sensitive nature of Roscoe made both these operations&nbsp;difficult. Having now resigned commercial pursuits&nbsp;entirely, he found a pleasant task in the arrangement of&nbsp;the great library at Holkham, the property of his friend&nbsp;Coke. In 1822 he issued an appendix of illustrations to&nbsp;his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lorenzo</span><span class="font2"> and also a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Memoir of Richard Robert Jones&nbsp;of Aberdaron,</span><span class="font2"> a remarkable self-taught linguist. The year&nbsp;1824 was memorable for the death of his wife and the&nbsp;publication of his edition of the works of Pope, which involved him in a controversy with Bowles. His versatility&nbsp;was shown by the appearance of a folio monograph on the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Monandrian Plants,</span><span class="font2"> which was published in 1828. It&nbsp;appeared first in numbers, and the last part came out&nbsp;after his recovery from a paralytic attack. He died on&nbsp;the 30th June 1831.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Roscoe’s character was a fine one. Under circumstances uncongenial and discouraging he steadfastly maintained the ideal of the intellectual life. Sensitive and conscientious, he sacrificed his&nbsp;possessions to a punctilious sense of duty. He had the courage of&nbsp;unpopular opinions, and, whilst promoting every good object in his&nbsp;native town, did not hesitate to speak out where plain dealing, as&nbsp;in the matter of slavery, was required. Nor was his public life&nbsp;more meritorious than his private career, for he was a sincere friend&nbsp;and exemplary in his domestic relations. Posterity is not likely&nbsp;to endorse the verdict of Horace Walpole, who thought Roscoe “ by&nbsp;far the best of our historians,” but in spite of newer lights and of&nbsp;some changes of fashion in the world of letters, his books on&nbsp;Lorenzo de’ Medici and Leo X. remain important contributions to&nbsp;historical literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In addition to the writings already named. Roscoe wrote tracts on penal jurisprudence, and contributed to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Trans act ions</span><span class="font0"> of the Royal Society of Literature and of the Linnean Society. The first collected edition of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Poetical</span><span class="font0"> IForis&nbsp;was published in 1857, and is sadly incomplete, omitting, with Otherversesknown&nbsp;to be from his pen, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Butterfly's Ball,</span><span class="font0"> a fantasy, which has charmed thousands&nbsp;of Cliildren since it appeared in 1820-21 in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Poems for Youth, by a Family Circle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font0"> by his son Henry Roscoe (2 vols., London, 1833) contains full details of Roscoe’s career.
