<p><span class="font1">the power of flight. This has been settIed by M. Fürbringer (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Untersuchungen . . </span><span class="font1">. 1888), and there is now no doubt that&nbsp;the absence of the power of flight is a secondary, not primitive,&nbsp;feature in the Ratitae as well as in the flightless </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bona fide&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Carinatae, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. Didus,</span><span class="font1"> and penguins. It had already been&nbsp;understood that the various genera of the Ratitae were the&nbsp;representatives of so many different groups, each of which&nbsp;was at least equivalent to ordinal rank, and that therefore, if&nbsp;the Ratitae were still to be considered a naturaI group, this&nbsp;common ancestry must be referred to a remote geological epoch.&nbsp;Fürbringer, however, separated </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Apteryx</span><span class="font1"> with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dinornis</span><span class="font1"> from the&nbsp;rest, combining his “ Apteryges ’’ with Crypturi and Galli&nbsp;as Alectorornithes, the latter being practically A. H. Garrod's&nbsp;Galliformes, of which his “ Struthiones ’’ form part together&nbsp;with the Tinamidae or Crypturi. Relationship of this otherwise typically carinate, neotropical family with the Ratitae&nbsp;had already been insisted upon by T. H. Huxley; hence&nbsp;his term Dromaeognathae for the Crypturi. L. Stejneger&nbsp;(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Standard Nat. Hist.,</span><span class="font1"> iv., Boston, 1885) applied this term&nbsp;in a new wider sense to all the Ratitae, and recently W. P.&nbsp;Pycraft has revived this notion by his division of the&nbsp;Neornithes into Dromaeo- and Neognathae. At any rate we&nbsp;begin to see that some of the Ratitae, namely the Rheidae, may&nbsp;possibly be an early and then much modified offshoot of such&nbsp;of the Carinatae as are now represented by the Crypturi, whilst in another part of the world, and at a much later time,&nbsp;kiwis and moas have sprung from a somewhat more Galliform&nbsp;stock, which points to </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font1">descent from a still undivided Galliform-Tinamiform mass. Further, it is the opinion of competent&nbsp;ornithologists that there is affinity of the Australian emeus and&nbsp;cassowaries with the New Zealand moas and with the Malagasy&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aepyornis. Struthio</span><span class="font1"> alone still stands aloof, possibly because&nbsp;it is the oldest and most specialized form. This genus was&nbsp;already typically developed in late Miocene times, and with a&nbsp;very wide geographical distribution (see Bird, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fossil</span><span class="font1">)</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font1"> but of&nbsp;the affinities of the other mid- and early tertiary flightless birds&nbsp;we know nothing, and it must be emphasized that we should&nbsp;probably not be able to classify a truly ancestral Ratite, namely,&nbsp;a bird which is still to a certain extent carinate and not&nbsp;yet ratite. It is impossible to give a satisfactory diagnosis of&nbsp;such intermediate forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All the recent Ratitae still possess a considerable number of rather primitive characters, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> they are typically nidifugous;&nbsp;the simple structure of their neossoptiles; quintocubital;&nbsp;compound rhamphotheca; holorhinal nares imperviae; basi-pterygoid processes; simple articular facet of the quadrate;&nbsp;configuration of the palatal bones, including the large vomer;&nbsp;incisura ischiadica; simple hypotarsus; the thigh muscles;&nbsp;the copulatory organ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We restrict the origin of the Ratitae to that great branch of still primitive Carinatae which, after separation of the Ratitae,&nbsp;has further deveIoped into the legion of the AIectoromorphae,*&nbsp;notably Tinami- and Galliformes, together with still low Gruiformes (see Bird, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Classification).</span><span class="font1"> From such a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rudis indigestaque moles,</span><span class="font1"> after it had attained an almost world-wide distribution, have arisen the various Ratitae, independently at&nbsp;various epochs and in various countries. Most of them are&nbsp;now restricted to widely separated countries of the southern&nbsp;hemisphere. Although loss of flight (correlated with more or&nbsp;less reduction of the wings and the sternaI keel, and often compensated by stronger hind limbs) has occurred, and is still taking&nbsp;place in various groups of birds, it is quite impossible that a new&nbsp;Ratite can still come into existence, because the necessary&nbsp;primitive substratum, whence arose the true Ratitae, is no&nbsp;longer available. Consequently we are justified in retaining&nbsp;“ Ratitae ’’ in our classification, although they are a hetero-geneous, not strictly monophyletic, assembIy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(H. F.

<p><span class="font1">RATKE (RATCHIUS), WOLFGANG (1571-1635), German educationist, was born at Wilster, Holstein, on the 18th of&nbsp;October 1571, and educated at the university of Rostock.&nbsp;His system of education was based upon Bacon’s philosophy,&nbsp;the principle being that of “ proceeding from things to names,”&nbsp;from the particular to the general, and from the mother tongue&nbsp;to foreign languages. In 1618 he opened schools at Augsburg&nbsp;and elsewhere, but at Köthen difficulties with the clergy led to&nbsp;his imprisonment for eight months, and after starting another&nbsp;school at Magdeburg in 1620 which failed, he became a wanderer&nbsp;and died at Erfurt on the 27th of April 1635. His ideas were&nbsp;far in advance of his time, but he lacked executive ability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RATLAM (or Rutlam), a native state of central India, in the Malwa agency. Area, 902 sq. m. Its territory is closely&nbsp;interlaced with that of Sailana. It is held as tributary to&nbsp;Sindhia; but in 1819 an arrangement was made by which&nbsp;Sindhia engaged never to send any troops into the country or&nbsp;to interfere with the internal administration, and in 1861 the&nbsp;tribute was assigned to the British government in part payment&nbsp;of the Gwalior contingent. The population in 1901 was 83,773,&nbsp;showing a decrease of 6% in the decade; estimated revenue,&nbsp;£34,000; tribute, £2850. The chief, whose title is raja, is a&nbsp;Rahtor Rajput of the Jodhpur family. The chief Sujjan&nbsp;Singh succeeded in 1893, and attained full powers in 1898. The&nbsp;town of Ratlam is 1577 ft. above sea-level. Pop. (1901) 36,321.&nbsp;It is a junction on the Rajputana-MaIwa railway, and an&nbsp;important centre of trade, especially in opium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RÂTNAGIRI, a town and district of British India, in the southern division of Bombay. The town is on the seacoast,&nbsp;136 m. S. of Bombay. Pop. (1901) 16,094. A leading industry&nbsp;is the sardine fishery, which usually takes place in January and&nbsp;February, and engages fleets of canoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The District of Ratnagiri has an area of 3998 sq. m. It forms a strip between the western Ghats and the sea, and its&nbsp;general character is rugged; nearly all the fertile land lies on&nbsp;the banks of the streams which intersect the country. The&nbsp;coast, about 150 m. in length, is almost uniformly rocky and&nbsp;dangerous. At intervals of about 10 m. a river or bay opens,&nbsp;sufficiently large to form a secure harbour for native craft, and&nbsp;the promontories at the river mouths are almost invariably&nbsp;crowned with the ruins of an old fort. The rivers and creeks&nbsp;are generally navigable for about 20 m., and afford facilities for&nbsp;a coasting trade. At the beginning of British rule there were&nbsp;no roads, and traffic was confined to places where there was&nbsp;water carriage; but a network of roads has been made, opening&nbsp;communication by hill passes with the Deccan. Ratnagiri&nbsp;formed part of the dominions of the peshwa, and was annexed&nbsp;by the British government in 1818 on the overthrow of Baji&nbsp;Rao. In 1901 the population was 1,167,927, showing an&nbsp;increase of 6% in the decade. Ratnagiri is the home of the&nbsp;influential class of Chitpavan Brahmans. It also supplies&nbsp;factory hands to Bombay and sepoys to the native army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RATNAPURA (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> “ The City of Gems ”), the chief town in the province of Sabaragamuwa, Ceylon. It is the centre of a&nbsp;long established industry in digging for precious stones—rubies,&nbsp;sapphires, cat’s-eyes, &amp;c. There is also much rice and fruit&nbsp;cultivation and planting of tea in the district. . Pop. of town&nbsp;(1901) 4084; of district 132,964.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RATON, a city and the county seat of Colfax county, New Mexico, U.S.A., in the N.E. part of the state, and about&nbsp;193 m. by rail N.E. of Santa Fé. Pop. (1890) 1255; (1900) 3540&nbsp;(337 foreign-born); (1910 census) 4539. Raton is served by the&nbsp;Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fé, the Saint Louis, Rocky Mountain&nbsp;&amp; Pacific, and the Santa Fé, Raton &amp; Eastern railways. The&nbsp;city lies immediately W. of the Raton Mountains, from which it&nbsp;derives its name, and has an elevation of 6400-6650 ft. above&nbsp;the sea. Among its institutions are a miners’ hospital, main-tained by the state, and a picturesque public park. The&nbsp;city lies within the Raton coal field, a southern continuation of&nbsp;the field of the same name in Colorado, and the richest coal-producing area in New Mexico. In 1907 70% of the total coal&nbsp;product of New Mexico came from Colfax county, in which this&nbsp;field is situated. Ores of gold, silver and lead have been mined&nbsp;in Colfax county. South and east of the city there is good&nbsp;farming land. Raton is a place of railway origin, and owes its&nbsp;development to its extensive railway shops, as well as to the&nbsp;proximity of mines. It was incorporated in 1891.</span></p><div style="border-right:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
