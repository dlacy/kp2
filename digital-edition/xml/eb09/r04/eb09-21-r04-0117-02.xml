<p><label>RYE</label>
. As in the case of other cereals, it is doubtful if rye <hi rend="italic">(Secale cereale)</hi> exists at the present time in a truly wild state. The best evidence on this point goes to show that the plant is a native of the regions between the Black and Caspian Seas. It is also recorded from Afghanistan and Turkestan ; but botanists are very chary about admitting the validity of the evidence hitherto adduced. Aitchison, the latest investigator of the flora of Afghanistan, mentions it as growing in wheat-fields, where it is considered as a weed, not being intentionally sown. In some fields “it almost eradicates the wheat crop.” But this merely shows that the conditions are more favourable to the growth of rye than to that of wheat. In spite of the uncertainty as to the precise origin of the cultivated plant, its cultivation does not appear to have been practised at a very early date, relatively speaking. Alphonse de Candolle, who has collected the evidence on this point, draws attention to the fact that no traces of this cereal have hitherto been found in Egyptian monuments or in the earlier Swiss dwellings, though seeds have been found in association with weapons of the Bronze period at</p><p>Olmiitz. The absence of any special name for it in the Semitic, Chinese, and Sanskrit languages is also adduced as an indication of its comparatively recent culture. On the other hand, the general occurrence of the name in the more modern languages of northern Europe, under various modifications, points to the cultivation of the plant then, as now, in those regions. The origin of the Latin name <hi rend="italic">secale,</hi> which exists in a modified form among the Basques and Bretons, is not explained. The circumstances that the cultivation of rye is relatively not of great antiquity and that it is confined to a relatively restricted area must be taken into account, in connexion with the fact that the variations of this cereal are much fewer than are noted in the case of other plants of like character.</p><p>The fact stated by Müller that the anthers and stigmas of the flowers come to maturity at the same time would tend to “ close fertilization ” and a consequent constancy of “characters” in the offspring, and, as a matter of fact, the varieties of this grass are not numerous. Rye is a tall-growing annual grass, with fibrous roots, flat, narrow, ribbon-like bluish-green leaves, and erect or decurved cylindrical slender spikes like those of barley. The spikelets contain two or three flowers, of which the uppermost is usually imperfect. The outer glumes are acute glabrous, the flowering glumes lance-shaped, with a comb-like keel at the back, and the outer or lower one prolonged at the apex into a very long bristly awn. AVithin these are three stamens surrounding a compressed ovary, with two feathery stigmas. AA <hi rend="sup">τ</hi> hen ripe, the grain is of an elongated oval form, with a few hairs at the summit.</p><p>In the southern parts of Great Britain rye is chiefly or solely cultivated as a forage-plant for cattle and horses, being usually sown in autumn for spring use, after the crop of roots, turnips, &amp;c., is exhausted, and before the clover and lucerne are ready. For forage purposes it is best to cut early, before the leaves and haulms have been exhausted of their supplies to benefit the grain. In the northern parts of Europe, and more especially in Scandinavia, Russia, and parts of northern Germany, rye is the principal cereal ; and in nutritive value, as measured by the amount of gluten it contains, it stands next to wheat, a fact which furnishes the explanation of its culture in northern latitudes ill-suited for the growth of wheat. Rye-bread or black-bread is in general use in northern Europe, but finds little favour with those unaccustomed to its use, owing to its sour taste, the sugar it contains rapidly passing into the acetous fermentation.</p><p>When the ovaries of the plant become affected with a peculiar fungus <hi rend="italic">(Cordyceps),</hi> they become blackened and distorted, constituting Ergot <hi rend="italic">(q.ν.).</hi></p>
