a borough in the county of Surrey, but one of the suburbs of London, being only separated from it by the river Thames. The means of access have been greatly increased by a new bridge, and by the re building of London Bridge. It contains six parishes, and, as to its police, is in a great degree under the control of the magistracy of the city. As it in fact forms a district of the capital, it is described under the head <hi rend="smallcaps">London</hi>.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
