                    conflicting responses being tendered from two or more&nbsp;jurists equally
                    privileged. It was an awkward predicament for a&nbsp;judge to be placed in.
                    Hadrian solved the difficulty by declaring&nbsp;that in such a case the judge
                    should be entitled to use his own&nbsp;discretion.<sup>@@1 </sup>That on
                    receiving a response with which he was dissatisfied he could go on calling for
                    others until he got one to his&nbsp;mind, and then pronounce judgment in
                    accordance with it on the&nbsp;ground that there was difference of opinion, is
                    extremely unlikely.&nbsp;The more probable explanation of Hadrian’s rescript is,
                    that the&nbsp;number of patented responding counsel was very limited; that
                    a&nbsp;judge, if he desired their assistance, was required by this

                    imperial council&nbsp;and publicly notified in all parts of the Empire. His

                    in principle, .it is thought, his successor on the throne&nbsp;was no more bound
                    to adopt any ofhis edicts than a praetor was to&nbsp;adopt those of his

                    transmuted into a senatus-consult; this fact proves of itself that an edict

                    opinion&nbsp;may have come to impute force of statute to the edict itself
