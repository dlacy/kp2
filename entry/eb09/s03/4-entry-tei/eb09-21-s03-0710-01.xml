In 1876 a new building was erected at the end of the park of St Cloud to replace the older structures, which were in a dangerous state, but have since been transformed into a normal school for girls. In the museum connected with the works are preserved specimens of the different kinds of ware manufactured in all ages and countries, and the whole series of models employed at Sèvres from the commencement of the manufacture, for an account of which see vol. xix. pp. 637-38. A technical school of mosaic was established at Sèvres in 1875.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
