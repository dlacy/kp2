<p><span class="font2">elevation in frönt of the pubic bones caused by a mass of fibro-fatty tissue; the skin over it is covered by hair in thc adult. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">labia majora</span><span class="font2"> are two folds of skin, also containing fibro-fatty&nbsp;tissue and covered on their outer surfaces by hair, running down&nbsp;from the mons Veneris to within an inch.of the anus and touching&nbsp;one another by their internal surfaces. They are the homologues&nbsp;of the scrotum in tbe male. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">labia minora</span><span class="font2"> are two folds of&nbsp;skin containing no fat, which are usually hidden by the labia&nbsp;majora and above enclose the clitoris, they are of a pinkish&nbsp;colour and look like mucous membrane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">clitoris</span><span class="font2"> is the representative of thc penis, and consists of two corpora cavernosa which posteriorly diverge to form the&nbsp;crura clitoridis, and are attached to the ischium; the organ is&nbsp;about an inch and a half long, and ends anteriorly in a rudimentary glans which is covered by the junction of the labia&nbsp;minora; this junction forms the prepuce of the clitoris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">orifice of the urethra</span><span class="font2"> is about an inch below the glans clitoridis and is slightly puckered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hymen</span><span class="font2"> is a fold of mucous membrane which surrounds the orifice of the vagina and is usually only seen in the virgin.&nbsp;As has been pointed out above, it is represented in the male by&nbsp;thc fold at the opening of the uterus rnasculinus. Occasionally&nbsp;the hymen is imperforate and then gives rise to trouble in&nbsp;menstruation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bulbs of the vestibule</span><span class="font2"> two masses of erectile tissue situated one on each side of the vaginal orifice: above they are&nbsp;continued up to the clitoris; they represent the bulb and the&nbsp;corpus spongiosum of the male, split into two, and the fact that&nbsp;they are so divided accounts for the urethra failing to be&nbsp;enclosed in the clitoris as it is in thc penis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">glands of Bartholin</span><span class="font2"> are two oval bodies about half an inch long, lying on each side of the vagina close to its opening; they&nbsp;represent Cowper’s glands in the male, and their ducts open by&nbsp;minute orifices between the hymen and the labia minora.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From the above description it will be seen that all the parts of the male external genital organs are represented in the&nbsp;female, though usually in a less developed condition, and that,&nbsp;owing to the orifice of the vagina, they retain their original&nbsp;bi-lateral form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Forfurther details see Quain<sup>t</sup>S </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anatomy</span><span class="font1"> (LondoniLongmans, Green &amp; Co.) ; Gray’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anatomy</span><span class="font1"> (London : Longmans, Green &amp; Co.) ;&nbsp;Cunningham’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Text-BoSk of Anatomy</span><span class="font1"> (Edinburgh: Young J.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Embryology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The development of the reproductive organs is so closely interwoven with that of the urinary that some reference from&nbsp;this article to that on the </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Urinary System</span><span class="font2"> is ncceàsary. It&nbsp;will here be convenient to take up the development at the stage&nbsp;depicted in the accompanying figure (fig. 7), in which the genital&nbsp;ridge </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font2"> is seen on each side of the attachment of the mesentery;&nbsp;external to this, and forming another slight ridge of its own, is&nbsp;the Wolffian duct, while a little later the Müllerian duct is&nbsp;formed and lies ventral to the Wolffian. The early history of&nbsp;these ducts is indicated in the article on the </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Urinary System.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Until the fifth or sixth week the development of the genital&nbsp;ridge is very much the same in the two sexes, and consists of&nbsp;cords of cells growing from the epithelium-covered surface into&nbsp;the mesenchyme, which forms the interior of the ridge. In&nbsp;these cords are some large germ cells which are distinguishable&nbsp;at a very early stage of development. It must, of course, be&nbsp;understood that the germinal epithelium covering the ridge, and&nbsp;the mesenchyme inside it, are both derived from the mesoderm&nbsp;or middle layer of the embryo. About the fifth week of human&nbsp;embryonic life the tunica albuginea appears in the male, from&nbsp;which septa grow to divide the testis into lobules, while the&nbsp;epithelial cords form the seminiferous tubes, though these do&nbsp;not gain a lumen until just before puberty. From thc adjacent&nbsp;mesonephros cords of cells grow into the attached part of the&nbsp;genital ridge, or testis, as it now is, and from these the rete testis&nbsp;is developed. Recent research, however, points to these cords&nbsp;of the rete testis ct ovarii as being derived from thc coelomic&nbsp;epithelium instead of from the mesonephros.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2">In the female the same growth of epithelial cords into the mesenchyme of the genital ridge takes place, but each one is</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">distinguished by a bulging toward its middle, in which alone the large germ cells are found. Eventually this bulging part is&nbsp;broken up into a series of small portions, each of which contains&nbsp;one germ cell or ovum, and gives rise to a Graafian follicle.&nbsp;Mesonephric cords appear as in the male; they do not enter the&nbsp;ovary, however, but form a transitory network </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(rete ovarii)</span><span class="font2"> in the&nbsp;mesovarium. As each gcnital gland enlarges it remains attached&nbsp;to the rest of the intermediate cell mass by a constricted fold of&nbsp;the coelomic membrane, known as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mesorchium</span><span class="font2"> in the male,&nbsp;and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mesovarium</span><span class="font2"> in the female. Lying dorsal to tbe genital&nbsp;ridge in the intermediate cell mass is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mesonephros,</span><span class="font2"> consisting</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">of numerous tubules which open into the Wolffian duct. This at first is an important excretory organ, but during development&nbsp;becomes used for other purposes. In the male, as has been&nbsp;shown, it may form the rete testis, and certainly forms the vasa&nbsp;efferentia and globus major of the epididymis: in addition to&nbsp;these, some of its separate tubes probably account for the vas&nbsp;aberrans and the organ of Giraldès (sec fig. 8, E. and O.G.). In&nbsp;the female the tubules of the epoöphoron represent the main part,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
