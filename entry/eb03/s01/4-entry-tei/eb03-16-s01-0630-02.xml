an archbiſhopric of Germany, in the circle of Bavaria, bounded on the eaſt by Stiria and the Upper Auſtria, on the weft by the county of Tyrol, on the north by the duchy of Bavaria, and on the ſouth by the duchy of Carinthia and the biſhopric of Brixen. It is ſaid to be about 100 miles from eaſt to weft, and upwards of 60 from north to ſouth. With reſpect to the ſoil, it is very mountainous, yielding, however, excellent paſturage, and, in conſequence of that, abounding in cattle, and horſes remarkable for their mettle and hardineſs. This country is particularly noted for the great quantities of ſalt it produces, and its ſtrong paſſes and cattles. Here are alſo conſiderable mines of gold, ſilver. copper, lead, iron, and lapis cala- minaris, with quarries of marble, and a natural hot-bath. The principal rivers are the Salza, the Inn, the Ens, and Muer; which, as well as the lakes and other ſtreams, are well-ſtored with fiſh. The peaſants here are all allowed the uſe of arms, and trained to military duty. There are no nobles in the country, and moſt of the lands belong to the clergy. The ſtates conſiſt of the prelates, the cities, and towns. Notwithſtanding this country is under the power of a Popiſh eccleſiaſtic, and the violent, arbitrary, and oppreſſive manner in which the Proteſtants have always been treated, great numbers of them ſtill remained in it till the year 1732, when no leſs than 30, 000 of them withdrew from it, diſperſing themſelves in the ſeveral Proteſtant ſtates of Europe, and ſome of them were even ſent from Great Britain to the American colonies. Beſides braſs and ſteel wares, and all ſorts of arms and artillery, there are manufactures of coarſe cloth and linen here The archbiſhop has many and great prerogatives: he is a prince oſ the empire, and perpetual legate of the holy ſee in Germany, of which he is alſo primate He has the firſt voice in the diet of this circle, and next to the electors in that of the empire, in the college of princes, in which he and the archduke of Auſtria preſide by turns. No appeal lies from him either in civil or eccleſiaſtical cauſes, but to the pope alone; and he is entitled to wear the habit of a cardinal. He has alſo the nomination to ſeveral biſhoprics; and the canonicates that fall vacant in the months in which the popes, by virtue of the concordat, are allowed to nominate, are all in his gift. His ſuffragans are the biſhops of Freyſingen, Ratiſbon, Brixen, Gurk, Chiemſee, Seckau, and Lavant; and of theſe, the four laſt are nominated, and even confirmed by him and not by the pope. At the diet of the empire, his envoy takes place of all the princes that are preſent, under the degree of an elector. His revenue is ſaid to amount to near 200,000 l. a year, a great part</p><p>of it ariſing from the ſalt-works. He is able to raiſe 25,000 men; but keeps in conſtant pay, beſides his guards, only one regiment, conſiſting of 1000 men. His court is very magnificent; and he has his hereditary great officers, and high colleges. The chapter conſiſts of 24 canons, who muſt be all noble, but are obliged only to four months reſidence. At his acceſſion to the fee, the archbiſhop muſt pay 100,000 crowns to Rome for the pall. There is an order of knighthood here, inſtituted in 1711, in honour of St Rupert, who was the firſt biſhop of Saltſburg about the beginning of the 8th century.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Saltsburg,</hi> the capital of a German archbiſhopric of the ſame name, and which takes its own from the river Salza, on which it ſtands, and over which it has a bridge. It is a very handſome place, well fortified, and the reſidence of the archbiſhop. The houſes are high, and all built of ſtone: the roofs are in the Italian taſte, and you may walk upon them. The caſtle here is very ſtrong, and as ſtrongly garriſoned, and well provided with proviſions and warlike ſtores. The archbiſhop’s palace is magnificent; and in the area before it is a fountain, eſteemed the largeſt and grandeſt in Germany. The ſtables are very lofty; and the number oſ the horſes uſually kept by the archbiſhop is ſaid to be upwards of 200. The city, of which one part ſtands on a ſteep rock, is well built, but the ſtreets are narrow and badly paved. Beſides the above-mentioned, there are two other ſtately palaces belonging to the archbiſhop, one of which is called the <hi rend="italic">Nuebau,</hi> and the other <hi rend="italic">Mirabella.</hi> The latter of theſe has a very beautiful garden; and the number of trees in the orangery is ſo great, that Mr Keyſler tells us, 20, 000 oranges have been gathered from them in one year. The river Salza runs cloſe by the walls of this garden. There are a great many other fine ſtructures in the city, public and private, ſuch as palaces, monaſteries, hoſpitals, and churches. In the cathedral dedicated to St Rupert (the apoſtle of Bavaria, and a Scotchman by birth), all the altars are of marble of different kinds, and one of the organs has above 3200 pipes. The whole ſtructure is extremely handſome. It is built of freeſtone in imitation of St Peter’s at Rome. The portico is of marble, and the whole is covered with copper. Before the portico there is a large quadrangular place, with arches and galleries, in which is the prince’s reſidence and there is a ſtatue Peter. In the middle of this place of an unnatural of the Virgin in bronze; it is fine, but of an unnatural ſize. There are large areas encompaſſed with handſome buildings on both ſides of the church. In the middle of that which is to the left, there is a moſt magnificent fountain of marble, and ſome valuable figures of gigantic ſize. There is likewiſe a fountain in that to the right, but it is not to be compared with the former one, and the Neptune of it makes but a very pitiful figure. This town contains many more excellent buildings and ſtatues, which remind one that the borders of Italy are not far diſtant. The winter and ſummer riding ſchools here are noble ſtructures. The univerſity was founded in 1620, and committed to the care of the Benedictines. Beſides it, there are two colleges, in which the young noblemen are educated. E Long. 33. 0. N.
