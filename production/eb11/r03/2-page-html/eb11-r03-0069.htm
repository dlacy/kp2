<p><span class="font1">RIO DE ORO, a Spanish possession on the N.W. coast of Africa. It is bounded W. by the Atlantic, E. and S. by Saharan&nbsp;territory under French protection. The northern frontier, where&nbsp;the protectorate adjoins the territory of the semi-independent&nbsp;tribes south of Morocco, is undefined. The most northerly&nbsp;point claimed by Spain on the coast is Cape Bojador. The&nbsp;southern and eastern boundaries were defined by a Franco-Spanish convention in 1900. The frontier traverses the middle&nbsp;of the Cape Blanco promontory, then runs eastward along the&nbsp;parallel of 21° 20' N. till it meets the meridian of 13° W., whence&nbsp;it turns first N.W. and afterwards N.E., meeting the tropic of&nbsp;Cancer at 12° W. and thereafter runs due N. Forming part of&nbsp;the Sahara, Rio de Oro is nearly waterless. Oases are few and&nbsp;the sparse population consists almost entirely of nomad Arabs&nbsp;and Berhers. They are Mahommedans. In the south is the&nbsp;hilly country called Adrar Suttuf, not to be confounded with&nbsp;Adrar Temur (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Adrar</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sahara).</span><span class="font1"> The estimated area of&nbsp;the protectorate is 70,000 sq. m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The peninsula of Rio de Oro, where is the principal Spanish settlement, occupies the central part of the coast-line in 23° so'&nbsp;N., 16° W., and is united to the mainland by a sandy isthmus.&nbsp;Its length is 23 m., its breadth ij to 2 m. and it is on an average&nbsp;about 20 ft. above sea-level. The bay between peninsula and&nbsp;mainland—the so-called Rio de Oro—is 22 m. long, 5 broad,&nbsp;navigable over two-thirds of its extent, with good anchorage in&nbsp;most of the channel, but the bar at its mouth is not always easy&nbsp;to pass in rough weather. The peninsula has very sparse&nbsp;vegetation, except in its southernmost part near Cape Durnford.&nbsp;At the head of the bay is a small island—Isla Herne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The climate is generally temperate, and not unhealthy except in the autumn. Esparto grass and manzanilla are grown in many&nbsp;places, but European plants are not easily acclimatized. On the&nbsp;peninsula and in the neighbouring country there are many wolves,&nbsp;loxes, hyenas, gazelles, lizards, hares, pelicans and large crows.&nbsp;The natives rear cattle, sheep, camels, and have but few horses.&nbsp;In contrast with the sterility of the land the sea throughout the coast&nbsp;of Rio de Oro abounds in fish, especially cod. The fishing industry&nbsp;is in the hands of the Canary Islanders and of the French.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The estuary between the mainland and the peninsula was taken by its Portuguese discoverers in the middle of the 15th century&nbsp;for a river, and, obtaining there a quantity of gold dust from the&nbsp;natives, they named it Rio d’Ouro (Gold River), Rio de Oro&nbsp;being the Spamsh form. At a spot about 50 m. inland from·&nbsp;the head of the estuary a Portuguese trading station was established, of which ruins exist, but the activity of the Portuguese&nbsp;was before long transferred to the true auriferous regions of the&nbsp;Gulf of Guinea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Spain’s interest in the Saharan coast dates from the 13th century, but was particularly directed to that part nearest the&nbsp;Canary Islands, a strip of coast over which she now exercises 110&nbsp;sovereignty. The site of the fort of Santa Cruz de Mar Pequefia,&nbsp;established in 1476, though not identified, was north of Cape&nbsp;Bojador. The protection of the Canary Islanders engaged in&nbsp;the fisheries south of that point occasioned, however, the presence&nbsp;of Spanish warships in these waters, and small trading stations&nbsp;were formed at Rio de Oro, Cape Blanco and elsewhere. To&nbsp;preserve the interests thus acquired, Spain in January 1885&nbsp;took the territories on the coast between capes Blanco and&nbsp;Bojador under her protection. The year before the Hispano-American Company had built a trading station on Rio de Oro&nbsp;peninsula, but in 1885 it was destroyed by the natives. The&nbsp;company renewed its operations, but subsequently ceded its&nbsp;rights to the Transatlantic Company of Barcelona. The extension inland of Spanish influence was opposed by France, which&nbsp;claimed a protectorate over the Sahara. The conflicting claims&nbsp;of the two powers were finally settled By the convention of 1900,&nbsp;which fixed the frontier in the manner stated. The administration is carried on under the control of the captain-general of the&nbsp;Canary Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIO GRANDE, a North American river, which rises in the San Juan Mountains of southern Colorado, flows S.E. and S.&nbsp;in Colorado, S. by W. and S.E. through New Mexico, and S.E.&nbsp;between Texas and Mexico to the Gulf of Mexico. Its length&nbsp;is approximately 2200 m., and for about 1300 m. it forms the&nbsp;international boundary between the UnitedStatesand Mexico.&nbsp;It presents many features of a complex physiographic type,&nbsp;being first a river of the Rocky Mountains, then of the interior deserts and then of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. It also&nbsp;presents a complicated geological history, as it includes what&nbsp;were originally several distinct streams. The Mexicans call&nbsp;it the Rio del Norte in its upper course, the Rio Bravo in the&nbsp;“ Big Bend,” from the mouth of the Conchas river to the&nbsp;mouth of the Devils river, and the Rio Grande only in its&nbsp;course through the Coastal Plain. From its headwaters,&nbsp;12,000 ft. above the sea, it rushes rapidly down a mountain&nbsp;canyon to San Luis ValIey, in Colorado. It flows with moderate&nbsp;speed through this broad valley, enters a long canyon with a&nbsp;maximum depth of 400 ft., about 4 m. above the boundary&nbsp;between Colorado and New Mexico, and is hemmed in between&nbsp;canyon walls rising as high as 1000 ft. or between the sides&nbsp;of narrow mountain ■ valleys throughout its course through&nbsp;New Mexico. It passes through a series of picturesque&nbsp;canyons, some of them 17so ft. in depth, in the “Big Bend,”&nbsp;and becomes a silt-laden stream with a shifting channel in&nbsp;its passage through the Coastal Plain. Except in the flood&nbsp;season of May and June, the quantity of water which, for&nbsp;irrigation and by evaporation, is taken from the Rio Grande&nbsp;between its entrance to the San Luis Valley and the mouth&nbsp;of the Conchas, is greater than that received, and as a consequence it is an intermittent stream in this region. The&nbsp;flow of the Conchas is constant, and in the *“ Big Bend ” the&nbsp;volume of the Rio Grande is enhanced by springs which break&nbsp;out in the bed. The total flow of the Rio Grande is ten times&nbsp;greater in some years than in others, and when its waters have&nbsp;been highest there have been great floods in its lower course&nbsp;and so much shifting of its banks as to cause international&nbsp;CompUcations. Even in its course through the Coastal Plain&nbsp;its channel is so much obstructed by sand bars that it is of&nbsp;little importance for navigation. As the increasing diversion&nbsp;of the water of the Upper Rio Grande for irrigation in Colorado&nbsp;and New Mexico resulted in a scarcity of water for this purpose&nbsp;in Mexico, that country complained, and to remedy the evil&nbsp;the Reclamation Service of the United States proposed the&nbsp;construction by the United States of a storage dam across&nbsp;the river near Engle, New Mexico, which would form a storage&nbsp;reservoir having a capacity of 2,000,000 acre-feet and from&nbsp;which Mexico should be furnished with 60,000 acre-feet of&nbsp;water annually. Mexico agreed to this proposal and a treaty&nbsp;covering the matter was proclaimed in January 1907. The&nbsp;principal towns and cities on the river are: BrownsviUe,&nbsp;Texas; Matamoros, Mexico; Laredo, Texas; El Paso,&nbsp;Texas; and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RlO GRANDE DO SUL, </span><span class="font1">a southern frontier state of Brazil, bounded N. by the state of Santa Catharina, E. by the Atlantic,&nbsp;S.. by Uruguay and W. by Uruguay and Argentina—the&nbsp;Uruguay river forming the boundary Une wdth the latter.&nbsp;Area, 91,333 sq. m. Pop. (1900) 1,149,070, an increase of&nbsp;251,61s since 1890. The northern part of the state lies on the&nbsp;southern slopes of the elevated plateau extending southward&nbsp;from Sao Paulo across the states of Paranâ and Santa&nbsp;Catharina, and is much broken by low mountain ranges whose&nbsp;general direction across the trend of the slope gives them the&nbsp;appearance of escarpments. A range of low mountains extends&nbsp;southward from the Serra do Mar of Santa Catharina and&nbsp;crosses the state into Uruguay. West of this range is a vast&nbsp;grassy plain devoted principally to stock-raising—the northern&nbsp;and most elevated part being suitable in pasturage and climate&nbsp;for sheep, and tfie southern for cattle. East of it is a wide&nbsp;coastal zone only sUghtly elevated above the sea; within it&nbsp;are two great tide-water lakes—Lagôa dos Patos and Lagôa&nbsp;Mirim—which are separated from the ocean by two sandy,&nbsp;partiaUy barren peninsulas. The coast is one great sand&nbsp;beach, broken only at one point—that of the outlet of the two&nbsp;lakes, caUed the Rio Grande, which affords an entrance to&nbsp;navigable inland waters and several ports. There are two</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
