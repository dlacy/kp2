<p><span class="font2">ed by the titles of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Captain oſ the queen's guards,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lieutenant general oſ Cornwall.</span><span class="font2"> From this period to the&nbsp;year 1594, he was continually engaged in projecting&nbsp;new expeditions, fending ſuccours to colonies abroad,&nbsp;defending the kingdom from the inſults of the Spani-ards, and tranſacting parliamentary buſineſs, with equal&nbsp;ability and refolution. whilſt thus employed, he was&nbsp;publicly charged, in a libel written by the infamous&nbsp;Jeſuit Parlous, with being an Atheiſt ; a groundleſs&nbsp;and ridiculous imputation. In 1594, he obtained from&nbsp;the queen a grant of the manor of Sherborne in Dor-ſetſhire, where he built a magnificent houſe : but Sir&nbsp;waiter fell under the queen’s diſpleaſure on account of&nbsp;an intrigue with the daughter of Sir Nicholas Throg-morton, one of the maids of honour ; however, he married the lady, and lived with her in great conjugal har-mony. During his diſgrace at court, he projected the&nbsp;conqueſt of Guiana in South America, and in 1595&nbsp;failed ſor that country ; of which having taken poſſeſſion, after defeating the Spaniards who were ſettled&nbsp;there, he returned to England the ſame year, and ſoon&nbsp;after publiſhed an account <sub>k</sub>of his expedition. In the&nbsp;following year he was one of the admirals in the ſucceſs-ful expedition againſt Cadiz, under the command of&nbsp;Howard and the earl of Eſſex ; and in 1597 he failed&nbsp;with the ſame commanders againſt the Azores. Soon&nbsp;after theſe expeditions, we find him aſſiduouſly engaged&nbsp;in parliamentary buſineſs, [and a diſtinguiſhed perſonage&nbsp;in jouſts and tournaments. In 1600 he was ſent on a&nbsp;joint embaſſy with Lord Cobham to Flanders, and at&nbsp;his return made governor of Jerſey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Queen Eliſabeth died in the beginning of the year 1603 ; and with her Raleigh’s glory and felicity funk,&nbsp;never to riſe again. Upon the acceſſion of James, Sir&nbsp;walter loſt his intereſt at court, was ſtripped of his preferments, and accuſed of a plot againſt the king. He&nbsp;was arraigned at wincheſter, and, on his trial, inſulted&nbsp;by the moſt ſhockmg brutality by the famous Coke,&nbsp;attorney-general, whoſe ſophiſtical vociferation influen-ced the jury to convict him without the leaſt proof of&nbsp;guilt. After a month’s impriſonment, however, in daily&nbsp;expectation of his execution, he was reprieved, and ſent&nbsp;to the Tower ; and his eſtat es were given to Car, earl of&nbsp;Somerſet, the king’s favourite. During this confine-ment, he wrote many of his moſt valuable pieces, parti-cularly his Hiſtory of the world. In March 1615, after 16 years impriionment, he obtained his liberty, and&nbsp;immediately began to prepare·for another voyage to&nbsp;Guiana. In Auguſt 161 6, the king granted him a very&nbsp;ample commiflion for that purpoſe ; and in July the&nbsp;year following, he failed from Plymouth : but, ſtrange&nbsp;as it may appear, it is moſt certain that the whole&nbsp;ſcheme was revealed to the Spaniards by the king himſelf, and thus neceſſarily rendered abortive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He returned to England in 1618, where he was foon after ſeized, imprifoned, and beheaded ; not for any pre-tended miſdemeanor on the late expedition, but in conſequence of his former attainder. The truth of the&nbsp;matter is, he was ſacrificed by the ptiſillanimous monarch&nbsp;to appeaſe the Spaniards ; who, whilſt Raleigh lived,&nbsp;thought every part of their dominions in danger. He&nbsp;was executed in old Palace Yard, and buried in St&nbsp;Margaret’s adjoining, in the ∙66th year of his age. His&nbsp;behaviour on the ſcaſſold was manly, unaffected, cheer-ful, and eaſy. Being aſked by the executioner which</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">be right, it is no matter which way the head lies.” He was a man of admirable parts, extenfive knowledge, un- '&nbsp;daunted reſſoIution, and ſtrict honour and honeſty. He&nbsp;was the author oſ a great many works, ſome of which&nbsp;have not been printed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RALLUS, the Rail, in ornithology ; a genus be-longing to the order of grallæ. The beak is thickeſt at the baſe, compreffed, equal, acute, and ſomewhat ſharp&nbsp;on the back near the point ; the noſtriis are oval ; thc&nbsp;feet have four toes, without any web ; and the body is&nbsp;compreffed. Mr Latham, in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Index Ornithologicus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">enumerates 24 ſpecies, befides ſome varieties. They&nbsp;are chiefly diſtinguiſhed by their colour. &quot; Theſe birds&nbsp;(ſays Buffon) conſtitute a large family, and their ha-bits are different from thoſe of the other ſhore-birds,&nbsp;which reſide on ſands and gravel. The rails, on the&nbsp;contrary, inhabit only the ſlimy margins of pools and&nbsp;rivers, eſpecially low grounds covered with flags and&nbsp;other large marſh plants. This mode of living is habitual and common to all the ſpecies of water-rails. The&nbsp;land rail frequents meadows, and from the diſagreeable&nbsp;cry, or rather rattling in the throat of this bird, is de-rived the generic name. In all the rails, the body is&nbsp;ſlender, and ſhrunk at the ſides ; the tail extremely&nbsp;ſhort ; the head ſmall ; the bill pretty like that ©f the&nbsp;gallinaceous kind, though much longer, and not ſo&nbsp;thick ; a portion of the leg above the knee is bare ; the&nbsp;three fore-toes without membranes, and very long : they&nbsp;do not, like other birds, draw their feet under their bel-ly in flying, but allow them to hang down : their wings&nbsp;are ſmall and very concave, and their flight is ſhort.—&nbsp;They ſeem to be more diffuſed than varied ; and nature&nbsp;has produced or tranſported them over the moſt diſtant&nbsp;lands. Captain Cook found them at the Straits of Ma-gellan ; in different iſlands of the fouthern hcmiſphere,&nbsp;at Anamoka, at Tanna, and at the iſle of Norfolk. In&nbsp;the Society Iſlands there are two ſpecies of rails ; a little black ſpotted one, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(pooa-ηee},</span><span class="font2"> and a little red-eyed&nbsp;one </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(mai-ho}.</span><span class="font2"> It appears that the two acolins of Fernandez, which he denominates </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">water-quails,</span><span class="font2"> are of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">ſpecies of rails peculiar to the great lake of Mexico.—&nbsp;The colins, which might be confounded with theſe, are&nbsp;a kind of partridges.” The principal are,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1. The aquaticus, or water-rail, is a bird of a long&nbsp;ſlender body, with ſhort concave wings. It delights&nbsp;leſs in flying than running : which it does very ſwiftly&nbsp;along the edges of brooks covered with buſhes : as it&nbsp;runs, it every now and then flirts up its tail, and in&nbsp;flying hangs down its legs ; actions it has in common&nbsp;with the water-hen. Its weight is four ounces and a&nbsp;half. The length to the end of the tail is 12 inches ;&nbsp;the breadth 16. The bill is ſlender, ſlightly incurvated, one inch three quarters long : the upper mandible&nbsp;black, edged with red ; the lower, orange-coloured :&nbsp;the head, hind part of the neck, the back, and coverts&nbsp;of the wings and tail, are black, edged with an olive&nbsp;brown ; the throat, breaſt, and upper part of the belly,&nbsp;are aſh-coloured : the ſides under the wings as far as&nbsp;the rump, finely varied with black and white bars. The&nbsp;tail is veι*y ſhort, conſiſts of 12 black feathers ; the&nbsp;ends of the two middle tipt with ruſt colour ; the fea-thers immediately beneath the tail white. The legs are&nbsp;placed far behind, and are of a duſky fleſh-colour. The&nbsp;toes very - long, and divided to their very origin ;&nbsp;though the feet are not webbed, it takes the water.;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">will f∞im ∩n it with mnrh f<sup>,</sup>afp. but i.&lt;s r&gt;ftpn nbſerued</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
