<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">roads to transcribe tlieir notes, so that they might be ready for the printer on arrival at their destination. Charles&nbsp;Dickens used to tell several stories of his adventures of&nbsp;this kind while he held an engagement on the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Morning&nbsp;Chronicle.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> He was, indeed, perhaps the best reporter of&nbsp;his time, and he was most successful in outstripping many&nbsp;of his rivals. One result of the efforts thus made was&nbsp;that the provincial newspapers were stimulated to greater&nbsp;efforts. Reporters were rapidly trained, and in all directions reporting grew. There were none but weekly newspapers ; but they devoted much of their space to reporting, and public men became more ready to speak as they&nbsp;found that what they said would be more widely made&nbsp;known. As railways were extended, the newspapers were&nbsp;able to extend the sphere of their work of this kind, and&nbsp;reporting spread apace. Then, with changes in the fiscal&nbsp;policy of the country, daily newspapers sprang up in all&nbsp;directions; the electric telegraph was being improved and&nbsp;developed so that greater facilities were given for reporting ; and in a few years the old supremacy of the London&nbsp;journals in this department of newspaper work had well-nigh disappeared. The country newspapers did more&nbsp;reporting of speeches and public meetings than the metropolitan papers. No public man made a speech but it was&nbsp;faithfully reproduced in print. Local governing bodies,&nbsp;charitable institutions, political associations, public companies—all these came in a short time to furnish work for&nbsp;the reporter, and had full attention paid to them. Curiously&nbsp;enough, while the country newspapers have thus cultivated&nbsp;reporting, and have made it one of their chief features,&nbsp;the London newspapers, for reasons into which this article&nbsp;need not enter, have fallen behind, and have for some&nbsp;years past given little attention to the work of which they&nbsp;were the originators. This fact explains a development of&nbsp;reporting which may be more fully described.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">When the second half of this century began, parliamentary reporting was a leading feature of the London newspapers. They had a monopoly of it. All the reporting arrangements in the House of Lords and in&nbsp;the House of Commons were made with sole regard to&nbsp;their requirements. There had indeed been a long battle&nbsp;between the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and some of the other London newspapers as to which should have the best parliamentary&nbsp;report, and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> had established its supremacy,&nbsp;which has never been shaken. But, while its reporting&nbsp;was fuller than that of other London daily newspapers,&nbsp;they did not neglect the work, and they gave in shorter&nbsp;compass admirable digests of the proceedings, with full&nbsp;reports of the most important speeches. The provincial&nbsp;newspapers were in the main obliged to copy the reports&nbsp;thus provided, and rarely made any attempt to get&nbsp;reports of their own. When the electric telegraph came&nbsp;into use for commercial purposes a change began. The&nbsp;company which first carried wires from London to the&nbsp;principal towns in the country started a reporting service&nbsp;for the country newspapers. It gathered up scraps&nbsp;of news and sent them to the journals that subscribed&nbsp;for the service. In addition, it procured admission to&nbsp;the parliamentary galleries for reporters in its employment, and began to send short accounts of the debates&nbsp;to the newspapers in the country. These newspapers&nbsp;were thus enabled to publish in the morning some&nbsp;account of the parliamentary proceedings of the previous&nbsp;night, instead of having to take like reports a day later&nbsp;from the London journals. The effect was greatly to&nbsp;stimulate the appetite of the provincial public for parliamentary reporting. The telegraph companies for a long&nbsp;time could or would do no more than they had begun by&nbsp;doing; and they offered no inducements to the provincial&nbsp;newspapers to telegraph speeches. The public meanwhile&nbsp;wanted to know more fully what their representatives&nbsp;were saying in parliament, and gradually the leading provincial newspapers adopted the practice of employing&nbsp;reporters in the service of the London journals to report&nbsp;debates on subjects of special interest in localities; and&nbsp;these reports, forwarded by train or by post, were printed&nbsp;in full, but of course a day late.. The London papers paid&nbsp;little attention to such debates, and thus the provincial&nbsp;papers had parliamentary reporting which was not to be&nbsp;found elsewhere. Bit by bit this feature was developed. It&nbsp;was greatly accelerated by a movement which the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scotsman&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">was the first to bring about. The telegraph companies&nbsp;had increased in number, but they had not given more&nbsp;facilities for newspaper reporting. About 1865, however,&nbsp;a new company having come into existence, it was agreed&nbsp;that wires from London should be put at the disposal of&nbsp;such newspapers as desired them. Each newspaper was&nbsp;to have the use of a wire—of course on payment of a&nbsp;large subscription—from six o’clock at night till three&nbsp;o’clock in the morning. This was the beginning of the&nbsp;“ special wire ” which now plays so important a part in&nbsp;the production of almost all newspapers. The arrangement&nbsp;was first made by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scotsman</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and by other newspapers&nbsp;in Scotland. The immediate result was that the parliamentary reporting in these papers was greatly increased,&nbsp;and was no longer confined to debates on local affairs. The&nbsp;special wires were used to their utmost capacity to convey reports of the speeches of leading statesmen and&nbsp;politicians; and, instead of bare summaries of what had&nbsp;been done, the newspapers contained pretty full reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">When the telegraphs were taken over by the state, the facilities for reporting were increased in every direction.&nbsp;But now, as to parliamentary reporting, a new difficulty&nbsp;arose. The London papers, with the exception of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">, had given less and less attention to parliamentary&nbsp;debates. There were, indeed, fairly long reports in one&nbsp;or two other newspapers in London, but the tendency was&nbsp;to shorten them, while on the other hand several of the&nbsp;provincial newspapers were giving more space than ever&nbsp;to the debates. These newspapers had to get their&nbsp;reports as best they could. The demand for such reporting had led, on the passing of the telegraphs into the&nbsp;hands of the state, to the formation of news agencies which&nbsp;undertook to supply the provincial papers. These agencies&nbsp;were admitted to the reporters’ galleries in the Houses of&nbsp;Parliament, and they provided longer or shorter reports of&nbsp;the debates, to meet the wishes of their clients. But the&nbsp;reports which any agency supplied were identical</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> that is&nbsp;to say, all the newspapers taking a particular class of&nbsp;report had exactly the same material supplied to them—&nbsp;the reporter producing the number of copies required by&nbsp;means of manifold copying paper. It is easy to see that,&nbsp;though this might serve the purpose of most of them, it&nbsp;could not meet the requirements of all; and accordingly&nbsp;attempts Avere made to get separate reports’ by engaging&nbsp;the services of some of the reporters employed by the&nbsp;London papers. Nothing else indeed was possible. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> gallery ” was shut to all, save the London papers and&nbsp;the news agencies. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scotsman</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> sought in vain to break&nbsp;through this exclusiveness. The line, it Avas said, must&nbsp;be drawn somewhere, and the proper place to draw it was&nbsp;at the London press. Once that line was departed from&nbsp;every newspaper in the kingdom must have admission.&nbsp;But in 1880 a select committee of the House of Commons&nbsp;was appointed to consider the question. It took evidence,&nbsp;and it reported in favour of the extension of the gallery&nbsp;and of the admission of provincial papers. The result was&nbsp;that some of the papers entered into combinations to&nbsp;procure reports; that is to say, three or four papers which&nbsp;would be satisfied with the same report joined in providing</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
