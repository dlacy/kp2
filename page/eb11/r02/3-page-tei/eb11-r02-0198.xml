At the revival of letters the treatise of Aphthonius once more became a standard text-book. Much popularity was enjoyed also by the exercises of Aelius Theon (of uncertain date; see Tiieon). (See further the editions of the <hi rend="italic">Rhetores Graeci </hi>by L. Spengel and by Ch. Walz.)</p><p>During the first four centuries of the empire the practice of the art was in greater vogue than ever before or since. First, there was a general dearth of the higher intellectual interests: politics gave no scope to energy; philosophy was stagnant, and literature, as a rule, either arid or frivolous. Then the Greek schools had poured their rhetoricians into Rome, where the same tastes which revelled in coarse luxuiy welcomed tawdry declamation. The law-courts of the Roman provinces further created a continual demand for forensic speaking. The public teacher of rhetoric was called “ sophist,” which was now an academic title, similar to “ professor ” or “ doctor.” In the 4th century b.c. Isocrates had taken pride in the name of <hi rend="italic">σοφιστήν,</hi>  which, indeed, had at no time wholly lost the good, or neutral, sense which originally belonged to it. The academic meaning which it acquired under the early empire lasted into the middle ages (see Du Cange, <hi rend="italic">s.v.,</hi>  who quotes from Baldricus, “ Egregius Doctor magnusque Sophista Geraldus ”). While the word <hi rend="italic">rhetor</hi>  still denoted the faculty, the word <hi rend="italic">sophistes</hi>  denoted the office or rank to which the rhetor might hope to rise. So Lucian (“ Teacher of Rhetoricians,” § i) says: “ You ask, young man, how you are to become a rhetor, and attain in your turn to the repute of that most impressive and illustrious title, sophist.” Lucian also satirizes the discussions of the nature of rhetoric in his parody</p><p>the <hi rend="italic">Parasite</hi>  (cf. also his <hi rend="italic">Bis Accusatus).</hi></p><p>Vespasian (70-79 a.d.), according to Suetonius, was the first emperor who gave a public endowment to the teaching of rhetoric. Under Hadrian and the Antonines (a.d. 117-180) the public chairs of rhetoric became objects of the highest ambition. The complete constitution of the schools at Athens was due to Marcus Aurelius. The</p><p>Philosophical school had four chairs <hi rend="italic">(fipovoi)—</hi>Platonic, Stoic, Peripatetic, Epicurean. The Rhetorical school had two chairs, one' for “ sophistic,” the other for “ political ” rhetoric. By “ sophistic ” was meant the academic teaching of rhetoric as an art, in distinction from its “ political ” application to the law-courts. The “ sophistical ” chair was superior to the “political” in dignity as in emolument,and its occupant was invested with a Jurisdiction over the youth of Athens similar to that of the vice-chancellor in a modern university. The Antonines further encouraged rhetoric by granting immunities to its teachers. Three “ sophists ” in each of the smaller towns, and five in the larger, were exempted from taxation <hi rend="italic">(Dig. </hi>xxvii.' r, 6, § 2). The wealthier sophists affected much personal splendour. PoIemon (6. a.d. 130) and Adrian of Tyre (c. a.d. 170) are famous examples of extravagant display. The aim of the sophist was to impress the multitude. His whole stock-in-trade was style, and this was directed to astonishing by <hi rend="italic">tours de forée.</hi>  The scholastic declamations were chiefly of two classes. (1) The <hi rend="italic">Suasoriae</hi>  were usually on historical or legendary subjects, in which some course of action was commended or censured (cf. Juv. <hi rend="italic">Satf.</hi>  These</p><p><hi rend="italic">Suasoriae</hi>  belonged to deliberative rhetoric (the <hi rend="italic">βουλευτικόν yévos, deliber ativum genus).</hi>  (2) The <hi rend="italic">Controversiae</hi>  turned especially on legal issues, and represented the forensic rhetoric <hi rend="italic">(bLKavLKov yevos, Judiciale genus).</hi>  But it was the general characteristic of this period that all subjects, though formally “ deliberative ” or “ forensic,” were treated in the style and spirit of that third branch which Aristotle distinguished, the rhetoric of <hi rend="italic">επίδειξή</hi>  or “ display.” The oratory produced by the age of the academic sophists can be estimated from a large extant literature. It is shown under various aspects, and presumably at its best, by such writers as Dio Chrysostom at the end of the ist century, AeIius Aristides (see Aristides, Aelius) in the 2nd, the chief rhetorician under the Antonines, Themistius, Himerius and Libanius in the 4th. Amid much which is tawdry or vapid, these writings occasionally present passages of true literary beauty, while they constantly offer matter of the highest interest to the student.</p><p>In the medieval system of academic studies, grammar, logic and rhetoric were the subjects of the trivium, or course followed during the four years of undergraduateship.</p><p>Music, arithmetic, geometry and astronomy constituted the quadrivium, or course for the three years from the B.A. to thé M.A. degree. These were the seven liberal arts. In the middle ages the chief authorities on rhetoric were the latest Latin epitomists, such as Martianus CapeIla (5th cent.), Cassiodorus (5th cent.) or Isidorus (7th cent.).</p><p>After the revival of learning the better Roman and Greek writers gradually returned into use. Some new treatises were also produced. Leonard Cox (d. 1549) wrote <hi rend="italic">The Art or Craft of Rhetoryke,</hi>  partly compiled, partly original, which was reprinted in Latin at Cracow. The <hi rend="italic">Art of Rhetoriqiie,</hi>  by Thomas Wilson (1553), afterwards secretary of state, embodied rules chiefly from Aristotle, with help from Cicero and Quintilian. About the same time treatises on rhetoric were published in France by Tonquelin (1555) and Courcelles (1557). The general aim at this period was to revive and popularize the best teaching of the ancients on rhetoric. The subject was regularly taught at the universities, and was indeed important.</p><p>At Cambridge in 1570 the study of rhetoric was based on Quintilian, Hermogenes and the speeches of Cicero viewed as works of art. An Oxford statute of 1588 shows that the same books were used there. In 1620 George Herbert was delivering lectures on rhetoric at Cambridge, where he held the office of public orator. The decay of rhetoric as a formal study at the universities set in during the 18th century. The function of the rhetoric lecturer passed over into that of correcting written themes; but his title remained long after his office had lost its primary meaning. If the theory of rhetoric fell into neglect, the practice, however, was encouraged by the public exercises (“ acts ” and “ opponencies ”) in the schools. The college prizes for “ declamations ” served the same purpose.</p><p>The fortunes of rhetoric in the modern world, as briefly sketched above, may suffice to suggest why few modern writers of ability have given their attention to the subject.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most notable modern contributions to the art is the collection of commonplaces framed (in Latin) by Bacon, “ to be so many spools from which the threads can be drawn out as occasion serves,” a truly curious work of that acute and fertile mind. He called them “ Antitheta.” A specimen is subjoined:—</p><table><row><cell cols="2" rows="1"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Uxor et Liberi</hi></p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p><hi rend="italic">For.</hi></p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p><hi rend="italic">Against.</hi></p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>“ Attachment to the state begins from the family.”</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="2"><p>“ He who marries, and has children, has given hostages to fortune.”</p><p>“ The immortality of brutes is</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>“ Wife and children are a dis</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>cipline in humanity.

The popularity enjoyed by Blair’s <hi rend="italic">Rhetoric</hi>  in the latter part of the 18th and the earlier part of the 19th century was merited rather by the form than by the matter. Campbell’s <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Rhetoric, </hi>which found less wide acceptance than its predecessor, was superior to it in Mepth, though often marred by an imperfect comprehension of logic. But undoubtedly the best modern book on the subject is Whately’s <hi rend="italic">Elements of Rhetoric.</hi></p><p>Starting from Aristotle’s view, that rhetoric is “ an offshoot from logic,” Whately treats it as the art of “ argumentative composition.” He considers it under four heads:</p><p>(1)    the address to the understanding ( = Aristotle’s <hi rend="italic">\ογικη πίστις);</hi></p><p>(2)    the address to the will, or persuasion (=Aristotle<hi rend="sup">i</hi>S<hi rend="italic">ηθική</hi>  and</p></body></text></TEI>
