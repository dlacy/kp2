                <p><label>SCOTLAND</label>, the country of the Scots, or that part of Great Britain
                    lying to the north of the Tweed; is ſituated between the 54th and 59th degrees
                    of north latitude, and extends in length about 278 miles, and in ſome places
                    near 180 in breadth; containing an area of 27,794 miles. On the ſouth it is
                    bounded by England; on the north, eaſt, and weft, by the Deucaledonian, German,
                    and Iriſh ſeas.</p>
                <p>It is extremely difficult to give any ſatisfactory account of the origin oſ the
                    appellation of <hi rend="italic">Scots,</hi> from which the country has derived
                    its name. It has puzzled the</p>
                <p>most eminent antiquaries, whoſe conjectures ſerve rather to perplex than to clear
                    up the difficulty. Nor is this to be wondered at, when Varro and Dionyſius could
                    not agree about the etymon of <hi rend="italic">Italia,</hi> nor Plutarch and
                    Solinus about that of <hi rend="italic">Rome.</hi> All that we know with any
                    degree of certainty, concerning the appellation of <hi rend="italic">Scot,</hi>
                    amounts to this—That it was at firſt a term of reproach, and conſequently framed
                    by enemies, rather than aſſumed by the nation diſtinguiſhed by that name. The
                    Highlanders, who were the genuine deſcendants of the ancient Scots, are
                    abſolutely ſtrangers to the name, and have been ſo from the beginning of time.

                    in a latter period alſo the more ſouthern, diviſion of North Britain, were at
                    firſt more powerful than the Caledonians of the weſt. It is therefore probable,
                    that the Picts, from a principle of malevolence and pride, were ready to traduce
                    and ridicule their weaker neighbours of Argyle. Theſe two nations ſpoke the ſame
                    language, the Gaelic. In that language <hi rend="italic">Scot,</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">Scode,</hi> ſignifies a corner or ſmall diviſion of a country.
                    Accordingly, a corner of north Britain is the very name which Giraldus
                    Cambrenſis gives the little kingdom of Argyle, which the ſix ſons of Muredus
                    king of Ulſter were ſaid, according to his information, to have erected in
                    Scotland. <hi rend="italic">Scot</hi> in Gaelic is much the ſame with <hi
                        rend="italic">little</hi> or <hi rend="italic">contemptible</hi> in Engliſh;

                    of men. (Dr <hi rend="italic">Macpherson's Diſſert.)</hi></p>
                <p>Others obſerve, that in the ſame language the word <hi rend="italic">Scuit</hi>
                    ſigniſies a <hi rend="italic">wanderer,</hi> and ſuppoſe that this may have been
                    the origin oſ the name of <hi rend="italic">Scot;</hi> a conjecture which they
                    think is countenanced by a paſſage in Ammianus Marcellinus (1. xxvii.), who
                    characterizes the men by the epithet of <hi rend="italic">roaming;</hi> “per
                    diverſa vagantes.” (Mr <hi rend="italic">Macpherſon. and Mr Whitaker).</hi></p>
                <p>All that we can ſay is, that for ſome one of the reaſons couched under the above
                    diſparaging epithets, their malicious or ſneering neighbours, the Picts or the
                    Britons, may have given the appellation of <hi rend="italic">Scots</hi> to the
                    anceſtors of the Scottiſh nation.</p>
                <p>At what time the inhabitants of the weſt of Scotland came to be diſtinguiſhed by
                    this name is uncertain. Porphyrius the philoſopher is the firſt who mentions
                    them, about the year of the Chriſtian era 267; and towards the middle of the 4th
                    century we find them mentioned with other Britiſh nations by Am. Marcellinus, in
                    the paſſage above referred to.</p>
                <p>The origin of the Scots has been warmly diſputed by many antiquaries of note;
                    particularly by Mr Macpherſon and Mr Whitaker. The firſt contends, that they are
                    of Caledonian, the latter, that they are of Iriſh extraction. Each ſupports his
                    poſition with ſuch arguments and authorities, that an impartial inquirer is
                    almoſt at a loſs which of their opinions he ought to eſpouſe. What appears moſt
                    probable is, that they are both partly in the right and partly in the wrong —The
                    Scots ſeem to have been originally deſcended from Britons of the ſouth, or from
                    Caledonians, who being preſſed forward by new colonies from Gaul, till they came
                    to the weſtern ſhore of Britain, paſſed over from thence into Ireland, probably
                    about 100 years before the Chriſtian era. About the year of Chriſt 320, they
                    returned again into Britain; or at leaſt a large colony of them, under the
                    conduct of Fergus, and ſettled on the weſtern coaſts of Caledonia, from whence
                    they had formerly migrated. As early as the year 340, we find them aſſociated
                    with the Picts in their expeditions to the Roman province; and for 90 or 100
                    years after, their ravages are frequently mentioned by the Roman and Britiſh
                    writers (<hi rend="italic">Whitaker's hiſt. of the Britons,</hi> 284).</p>
                <p>The territory of the ancient Scots, before the annexation of Pictavia,
                    comprehended all that ſide of Caledonia which lies along the north and weſtern
                    ocean, from the frith of Clyde to the Orkneys. Towards the eaſt, their dominions
                    were divided from the Pictiſh</p>
                <p>territories by thoſe high mountains which run from Dumbarton to the frith of
                    Tain. —In proceſs of time, the Scots, under the reign of Kenneth the ſon of
                    Alpin, became ſo powerful as to ſubdue entirely their neighbours the Picts, and
                    gave their own denomination to all Caledonia, Pictavia, and Valentia; all which
                    are ſtill comprehended under the general name of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Scotland.</hi></p>
                <p>Like thoſe of all other nations, the hiſtorians of Scotland aſſitme too great an
                    antiquity for their countrymen; however, they are much leſs extravagant in this
                    reſpect than many others. By them the reign of Fergus, the firſt Scots monarch,
                    is placed in 330 B. C. He was the ſon of Ferchard an Iriſh prince; and is ſaid
                    to have been called into Scotland by the Caledonians, to aſſiſt them againſt the
                    ſouthern Britons, with whom they were then at war. Having landed on one of the
                    Aebudae or weſtern iſles, he had a conference with the Caledonians, whoſe
                    language and manners he found to be the ſame with thoſe of his countrymen.
                    Having then landed in Scotland, and taken the field at the head of his new
                    allies, he engaged the Britons under their king Coilus. Victory declared in
                    favour of the Scots; Coilus was defeated and killed; and from him the province
                    of Kyle firſt received its name. After this Fergus was declared king of the
                    Scots, with the ſolemnity of an oath. But he did not long enjoy his new dignity:
                    for having been recalled to Ireland to quiet ſome commotions there, he was
                    drowned, by a ſudden tempeſt, on his return, at a place in Ireland called from
                    him <hi rend="italic">Knock-Fergus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Carrick-Fergus;
                        i.e.</hi> Fergus’s Rock.</p>
                <p>Fergus was ſucceeded by his brother Feritharis, to the prejudice of his two ſons
                    Ferlegus and Mainus, This, we are told by the ancient Scottiſh writers, was done
                    in conformity to a law, by which it was ordained, that whilſt the children of
                    their kings were infants, one of their relations who was reckoned the moſt fit
                    for the government ſhould be railed to the throne, but that after his death the
                    ſovereignty ſhould return to the ſons of the former king. This was the caſe at
                    preſent; however, Ferlegus, impatient for the crown, made a formal demand of it
                    from his uncle. The diſpute being referred to an aſſembly of the ſtates,
                    Feritharis was confirmed on the throne; and Ferlegus would have been condemned
                    for ſedition, had not his uncle interpoſed. However, he was impriſoned; but
                    having made his eſcape, he fled firſt to the Picts, and then to the Britons, in
                    order to excite them againſt Feritharis. With both he failed in accompliſhing
                    his purpoſe: but, in the mean time, his uncle being ſtabbed in his bed, the
                    ſuſpicion fell upon Ferlegus, who was thereupon ſet aſide from the ſucceſſion,
                    and died in obſcurity, the throne being conferred upon his brother Mainus.</p>
                <p>The reigns of Mainus, Dornadil, and Nothat, afford nothing remarkable, excepting
                    that Dornadil, who was a great hunter, inſtituted the laws of hunting in this
                    country. Nothat was killed in a battle with Reuther his nephew; upon which the
                    latter was immediately inveſted with the ſovereignty. A bloody war enſued, in
                    which both parties were reduced to the laſt extremity, and glad at length to
                    conclude a peace. The fate of Reuther is not known; but it is generally ſuppoſed
                    that he ended his life in the year 187 B. C.</p>
                <p>The reigns of Reutha, Thereus, Jalina, and Finnan,<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0730.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0724"/> afford no
                    remarkable tranſactions, excepting that under the laſt we find the firſt
                    beginnings of the Scottiſh parliament; as he enacted, that kings ſhould do
                    nothing without the conſent of their grand council. — After him followed
                    Durſtus, Even, and Gillus, whoſe reigns afford nothing of conſequence. Even II
                    the nephew of Finnan, who ſucceeded Gillus, is ſaid to have built the towns of
                    Innerlochy and Inverneſs. He overcame Belus king of the Orkneys, who had invaded
                    Scotland; and was ſucceeded by his ſon Eder, in whole time Julius Caeſar invaded
                    the ſouthern parts of this iſland. Eder is laid to have aſſiſted the Britons
                    againſt the common enemy. He was ſucceeded, after a reign of 48 years, by his
                    ſon Even III. who is repreſented as a monſter of cruelty and luſt. Not content
                    with having 100 noble concubines of his own, he made a law that a man might
                    marry as many wives as he could maintain; and that the king ſhould have the
                    firſt night with every noble bride, and the nobles the like with the daughters
                    of their tenants. Nor was he leſs remarkable for his cruelty and rapaciouſneſs,
                    which at laſt occaſioned a rebellion; and Even was dethroned, impriſoned, and
                    put to death.</p>
                <p>We meet with nothing memorable in the hiſtory of Scotland ſrom this time to that
                    of Agricola, excepting that the famous Caractacus, who was carried priſoner to
                    Rome, is ſaid to have been one of the Scottiſh monarchs; which, however, ſeems
                    not very probable, as the Romans in his time had not penetrated near ſo far as
                    Scotland. The invaſion of Agricola happened during the reign of Corbred, called
                    by the Roman hiſtorians <hi rend="italic">Galgacus.</hi> Agricola having
                    completed the conqueſt of the ſouthern parts, and in a great meaſure civilized
                    the inhabitants, formed a like plan with regard to Scotland. It is probable,
                    that at this time the Caledonians or Scots were rendered more formidable than
                    ever they had been, by the acceſſion of great numbers from the ſouth; for though
                    the Romans had civilized the greateſt part, it cannot be doubted that many of
                    thoſe ſavage warriors, diſdaining the pleaſures of a peaceable life, would
                    retire to the northward, where the martial diſpoſition of the Scots would better
                    ſuit their inclination. The utmoſt efforts of valour, however, were not proof
                    againſt the diſcipline of the Roman troops, and the experience of their
                    commander. In the third year Agricola had penetrated as far as the river Tay;
                    but the particulars of his progreſs are not recorded. The following year he
                    built a line of forts between the friths of Forth and Clyde, to exclude the
                    Caledonians from the ſouthern parts of the iſland; and the year after, he
                    ſubdued thoſe parts which lay to the ſouth and weſt of his forts, namely, the
                    counties of Galloway, Cantyre, and Argyle, which at that time were inhabited by
                    a people called <hi rend="italic">Gangi,</hi> though ſome historians place theſe
                    as far ſouth as Cheſhire in England, and the north part of Wales. This
                    ſuppoſition, however, can ſcarcely be admitted, when we conſider that Tacitus
                    expreſsly informs us, that the people whom Agricola conquered had never before
                    been known to the Romans</p>
                <p>Agricola ſtill purſued the ſame prudent meaſures by which he had already ſecured
                    the poffeſſion of ſuch a large tract of country, that is, advancing but ſlowly,
                    and building forts as he advanced, in order to keep the people in obedience. The
                    Scots, though commanded</p>
                <p>by their king, who is ſaid to have been well acquainted with the manner of
                    fighting and diſcipline of the Romans, were yet obliged to retreat; but at laſt,
                    finding that the enemy made ſuch progreſs as endangered the ſubjugation of the
                    whole country, he reſolved to cut off their communication with the ſouthern
                    parts, and likewiſe to prevent all poſſibility of a retreat by ſea. Agricola,
                    though ſolicited by ſome of his officers, refuted to retreat; but divided his
                    troops into three bodies, having a communication with each other. Upon this,
                    Galgacus reſolved to attack the weakeſt of the three, which conſiſted only of
                    the ninth legion, and lay at that time, as is ſaid, at a place called <hi
                        rend="italic">Lockore,</hi> about two miles from Loch-Leven in Fife. The
                    attack was made in the night: and as the Romans were both unprepared and
                    inferior in number, the Scots penetrated into the heart of their camp, and were
                    making a great ſlaughter, when Agricola detached ſome light-armed troops to
                    their aſſiſtance; by whom the Caledonians in their turn were routed, and forced
                    to fly to the marſhes and inacceſſible places, where the enemy could not follow
                    them.</p>
                <p>This engagement has been magnified by the Roman hiſtorians into a victory, though
                    it can ſcarce be admitted from the teſtimonies of other hiſtorians. The Romans,
                    however, certainly advanced very conſiderably, and the Scots as conſtantly
                    retreated, till they came to the foot of the Grampian mountains, where the
                    Caledonians reſolved to make their laſt ſtand. In the eighth year of the war,
                    Agricola advanced to the foot of the mountains, where he found the enemy ready
                    to receive him. Tacitus has given us a ſpeech of Galgacus, which he has
                    undoubtedly fabricated for him, in which he ſets forth the aſpiring difpoſition
                    of the Romans, and encourages his countrymen to defend themſelves vigorouſly, as
                    knowing that every thing valuable was at ſtake. A deſperate engagement
                    accordingly enſued. In the beginning, the Britons had the advantage, by the
                    dexterous management of their bucklers: but Agricola having ordered three
                    Tungrian and two Batavian cohorts, armed with ſhort ſwords, and emboſſed
                    bucklers terminating in a point, to attack the Scots, who were armed with long
                    ſwords, the latter soon found theſe weapons uſeleſs in a cloſe encounter; and as
                    their bucklers only covered a small part of their bodies, they were eaſily cut
                    in pieces by their adverſaries. The most forward of their cavalry and
                    charioteers fell back upon their infantry, and diſordered the centre; but, the
                    Britons endeavouring to out flank their enemies, the Roman general oppoſed them
                    with his horſe; and the Caledonians were at laſt routed with great ſlaughter,
                    and forced to fly into the woods, whither the Romans purſued with ſo little
                    caution, that numbers of them were cut off Agricola, however, having odered his
                    troops to proceed more regularly, prevented the Scots from attacking and cutting
                    off his men in separate parties, as they had expected; ſo that this victory
                    proved the greateſt ſtroke to the Caledonians that they had hitherto received
                    This battle is ſuppoſed by ſome to have been fought in Strathern, half a mile
                    ſouth from the kirk of Comrie; but others imagine the place to have been near
                    Fortingal- Gamp, a place ſomewhat farther on the other ſide of the Tay.</p>
                <p>Great as this victory was, it ſeems not to have been<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0731.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0725"/> productive of
                    any ſolid or laſting advantage to the Romans; ſince we find that Agricola,
                    inſtead of putting an end to the war by the immediate conqueſt of all Caledonia,
                    retreated into the country of the Foreſti, commonly ſuppoſed to be Forſarſhire,
                    though others imagine it to have been the county of Fife. Here he received
                    hoſtages from part of the Caledonians; and ordered part of his fleet to ſail
                    round Britain, that they might diſcover whether it was an iſland or a continent.
                    The Romans no former had left that part of the country, than the Caledonians
                    demoliſhed all the forts they had raiſed: and Agricola being ſoon after recalled
                    by Domitian, the further progreſs of the Roman arms was flopped; Galgacus
                    proving ſuperior to any of the ſucceſors of that general.</p>
                <p>From the time of Agricola to that of Adrian, we know little of the affairs of
                    Scotland, excepting that during this interval the Scots muſt have entirely
                    driven the Romans out of their country, and reconquered all that tract which lay
                    between Agricola’s chain of forts and Carliſle on the weſt, and Newcaſtle or
                    Tinmouth- Bar on the eaſt; which Adrian, on viſiting Britain, thought proper to
                    fix as the northern boundary of the Roman dominions. Here he built a wall of
                    turf between the mouth of the Tine and the Solway frith, with a view to ſhut out
                    the barbarians; which, however, did not anſwer the purpoſe, nor indeed could it
                    be thought to do ſo, as it was only built of turf, and guarded by no more than
                    18,000 men, who could not be ſuppoſed a ſufficient force to defend ſuch an
                    extent of fortification.</p>
                <p>On the departure of Adrian, he left Julius Severus as his lieutenant: but this
                    man, though one of the greateſt commanders of his age, did not carry his arms to
                    the northward of Adrian’s wall; and this long interval of peace gave ſo much
                    ſecurity to Mogold the Scottiſh monarch, that he degenerated into a tyrant, and
                    was murdered by ſome of his noblemen. The only inſtance of his tyranny which is
                    produced, however, is a law by which it was enacted, that the eſtates of ſuch as
                    were condemned ſhould be forfeited to his exchequer, without any part thereof
                    being allotted to their wives and children; an act which ſubſiſts almoſt in its
                    full force to this day in Great Britain and the beſt regulated European
                    governments.</p>
                <p>In the reign of Antoninus Pius, the proprietor Lollius Urbius drove the Scots far
                    to the northward, and repaired the chain of forts built by Agricola, which lay
                    between the Carron on the frith of Forth and Dunglaſs on the Clyde. Theſe were
                    joined together by turf walls, and formed a much better defence than the wall of
                    Adrian. However, after the death of Antoninus, Commodus having recalled
                    Calpurnius Agricola, an able commander, who kept the Scots in awe, a more
                    dangerous war broke out than had ever been experienced by the Romans in that
                    quarter. The Scots having paſſed the wall, put all the Romans they could meet
                    with to the ſword: but they were ſoon repulſed by Ulpius Marcellus, a general of
                    conſummate abilities, whom Commodus ſent into the iſland. — In a ſhort time the
                    tyrant alſo recalled this able commander. After his departure, the Roman
                    diſcipline in Britain ſuffered a total relaxation; the ſoldiery grew mutinous,
                    and great djſorders enſued: but theſe were all happily removed by the arrival,
                    of Clodius Albinus, a perſon of great ſkill and experience in military affairs.
                    His preſence for ſome time reſtrained the Scots within proper bounds: but a
                    civil war breaking out between him and Severus, Albinus croſſed over to the
                    continent with the greateſt part of the Roman forces in Britain; and meeting his
                    antagoniſt at Lyons, a dreadful battle enſued, in which Albinus was utterly
                    defeated, and his army cut in pieces. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Rome,</hi> n⁰
                    375.</p>
                <p>The abſence of the Roman forces gave encouragement to the Scots to renew their
                    depredations, which they did with ſuch ſucceſs, that the emperor became
                    apprehenſive of loſing the whole iſland; on which he determined to go in perſon
                    and quell theſe troubleſome enemies. The army he collected upon this occaſion
                    was far more numerous than any the Romans had ever ſent into Britain; and being
                    commanded by ſuch an able general as Severus, it may eaſily be ſuppoſed that the
                    Scots muſt have been very hard preſſed. The particulars of this important
                    expedition are very imperfectly related; however, we are aſſured that Severus
                    loſt a vaſt number of men, it is ſaid not leſs than 50,000, in his march through
                    Scotland. Notwithſtanding, he penetrated, it is laid, to the moſt northern
                    extremity of the iſland, and obliged the enemy to yield up their arms. On his
                    return, he built a much ſtronger fortification to ſecure the frontiers againſt
                    the enemy than had ever been done before, and which in ſome places coincided
                    with Adrian’s wall, but extended farther at each end. But in the meantime, the
                    Scots, provoked by the brutality of the emperor’s ſon Caracalla, whom he had
                    left regent in his abſence, again, took arms: on which Severus himſelf took the
                    field, with a deſign, as it would ſeem, to extirpate the whole nation; for he
                    gave orders to his ſoldiers “not to ſpare even the child in the mother’s belly.”
                    The event of his furious declaration is unknown: but in all probability the
                    death of the emperor, which happened ſoon after, put a flop to the execution of
                    this revenge; and it is certain that his ſon Caracalla, who ſucceeded Severus,
                    ratified the peace with the Scots.</p>
                <p>During all theſe important tranſactions, Scotland was governed by Donald I. who
                    is ſaid to have been the firſt Chriſtian king of this country. From him to the
                    time of Eugene I. no remarkable occurrence offers; but under the latter, the
                    Roman and Fictiſh forces were united againſt the Scots. The Picts were commanded
                    by their king, named <hi rend="italic">Hargust;</hi> and the Romans by Maximus,
                    who murdered Valentinian III. and afterwards aſſumed the empire<note

                    <hi rend="italic">§</hi>. The allies defeated Eugene in the county of Galioway;
                    but Maximus being obliged to return ſouthward on account of an inſurrection, the
                    Picts were in their turn defeated by the Scots. Next year, however, Maximus
                    marched againſt the Scots; who being now reduced to extremity, brought into the
                    field not only all the men capable of bearing arms, but the women alſo. In this
                    engagement the Picts would have been utterly defeated, had not they been
                    ſupported by the Romans; but Eugene being killed, with the greateſt part of his
                    nobility, the Scots were defeated; and ſo well did the conquerors improve their
                    victory, that their antagoniſts were at laſt totally driven out of the country.
                    Some of them took refuge in the Aebudae iſlands, and ſome in Scandinavia and
                    Ireland, from whence they made frequent deſcents upon Scotland. The Picts were
                    at firſt mightily pleased<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0732.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0726"/> with the victory they had gained over their
                    antagoniſts; but being commanded to adopt the laws of the Romans, and to chooſe
                    no king who was not ſent them from Rome, they began to repent of their having
                    contributed to the expulſion of the Scots; and in the year 421, when Autulphus
                    king of the Goths ſent over a body of exiled Scots to Britain, under Fergus, a
                    deſcendant of the royal family of Scotland, the Picts immediately joined them
                    againſt the common enemy. The conſequence of this was, that the Britons were
                    puſhed to the laſt extremity; and the Romans being obliged, on account of the
                    inundation of northern barbarians who poured in upon them, to recal their forces
                    from Britain, the inhabitants were reduced to the moſt miſerable ſituation that
                    can be imagined. In the time of Fergus II. they were obliged to give up all the
                    country which lies to the north of Adrian’s wall; and in the reign of Grimus or
                    Graham, the ſucceſſor of Fergus, they were obliged to write that remarkable
                    letter to Rome, intitled, “The groans of the Britons<note anchored="true" n="2" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>† See England, n⁰ 27.</p></note> †.”
                    This, however, not being attended with ſucceſs, the Britons were obliged to call
                    in the Saxons to their aſſiſtance. By theſe new allies the Scots were defeated
                    in a great battle, and their king (Eugene) drowned in the river Humber; which
                    put a ſtop for ſome time to theſe incurſions.</p>
                <p>Hitherto we have ſeen the Scots very formidable enemies to the ſouthern Britons.
                    But when the Saxons became the enemies of the Britons, the Scots joined in a
                    ſtrict alliance with the latter; and the famous king A rthur is ſaid to have
                    been aſſiſted by the Scots in all his battles with the Saxons: neither does it
                    appear that this league was ever diſſolved again, though the united efforts of
                    the Scots and Brſtons were not ſufficient to preſerve the independency of the
                    latter.</p>
                <p>The next remarkable event in the hiſtory of Scotland is the war with the Picts,
                    which took place in the ninth century. The occaſion of the quarrel was, that
                    Dongal king of Scotland pretended a right to the Pictiſh throne; which, however,
                    was rejected by the Picts: upon which both parties had recourſe to arms; but
                    when every thing was ready for the campaign, Dongal was drowned in croſſing the
                    river Spey.</p>
                <p>At this time the dominions of the Scots comprehended the weſtern iſlands,
                    together with the counties of Argyle, Knapdale, Kyle, Kintyre, Lochaber, and a
                    part of Breadalbane; while the Picts poſſeſſed all the reſt of Scotland, and
                    part of Northumberland; ſo that the Picts ſeem to have been by much the moſt
                    powerful people of the two. However, the Scots appear to have been ſuperior in
                    military ſkill; for Alpin, the ſucceſſor of Dongal, having engaged the Pictiſh
                    army near Forfar, after an obſtinate engagement defeated them, and killed their
                    king, though not without the loſs of a great number of his own men. The Picts
                    choſe Brudus, the ſon of their former king, to ſucceed him; but ſoon after
                    depoſed and put him to death, on account of his ſtupidity and indolence. His
                    brother Kenneth ſhared the ſame fate on account of his cowardice; till at laſt
                    another Brudus, a brave and ſpirited prince, aſcended the throne. Having raiſed
                    a powerful army, he began with offering terms of peace to the Scots; which,
                    however, Alpin rejected, and inſiſted upon a total ſurrender of his crown.
                    Brudus on this endeavoured to procure the aſſiſtance of Edwin</p>
                <p>king of Northumberland. Edwin accepted the money; but pretending to be engaged in
                    other wars, he refuſed the aſſiſtance which he at firſt promiſed. Brudus, not
                    diſmayed by this diſappointment, marched reſolutely againſt his enemies; and the
                    two armies came to an engagement near Dundee. The ſuperior ſkill of the Scots in
                    military affairs was about to have decided the victory in their favour, when
                    Brudus bethought himſelf of the following ſtratagem to preſerve his army from
                    deſtruction. He cauſed all the attendants, and even the women who attended his
                    army, to aſſemble and ſhow themſelves at a diſtance as a powerful reinforcement
                    coming to the Picts. This ſtruck the Scots with ſuch a panic, that all the
                    efforts of Alpin could not recover them; and they were accordingly defeated with
                    great ſlaughter. Alpin himſelf was taken priſoner, and ſoon after beheaded by
                    order of the conqueror. This execution happened at a place now called <hi
                        rend="italic">Pit-alpy,</hi> but in former times <hi rend="italic"
                        >Bas-alpin,</hi> which in the Gaelic language ſigniſies the <hi
                        rend="italic">death of Alpin.</hi> His head was afterwards ſtuck upon a
                    pole, and expoſed on a wall.</p>
                <p>Alpin was ſucceeded by his ſon Kenneth II. who being a brave and enterpriſing
                    prince, reſolved to take a moſt ſevere revenge for his father’s death. The
                    Scots, however, were ſo diſpirited by their late defeat, that they were
                    exceedingly averſe to any renewal of the war: while, on the other hand, the
                    Picts were ſo much elated, that they made a law by which it became death for any
                    man to propoſe peace with the Scots, whom they reſolved to exterminate; and ſome
                    of the nobility were expelled the council on account of their oppoſition to this
                    law. The conſequence of this was, that civil diffenſions took place among them,
                    and a bloody battle was fought between the oppoſite parties, before the Scots
                    had thought of making any farther reſiſtance.</p>
                <p>By theſe diſtractions Brudus, wſho had in vain endeavoured to appeaſe them, was
                    ſo much affected, that he died of grief; and was ſucceeded by his brother
                    Druſken. —The new prince alſo failed in his endeavours to accommodate the civil
                    differences; ſo that the Scots, by gaining ſo much reſpite, at laſt began to
                    recover from their conſternation; and ſome of them having ventured into the
                    Pictiſh territories, carried off Alpin’s head from the capital of their
                    dominions, ſuppoſed to have been Abernethy. In the mean time, Kenneth ſound
                    means to gain over the nobility to his ſide by the following ſtratagem; which,
                    however ridiculous, is not incredible, if we conſider the barbariſm and
                    ſuperſtition of that age. Having invited them to an entertainment, the king
                    introduced into the hall where they ſlept a perſhn clothed in a robe made of the
                    ſkins of fifties, which made ſuch a luminous appearance in the dark, that he was
                    miſtaken for an angel or ſome ſupernatural meſſenger. To add to the terror of
                    thoſe who ſaw him, he denounced, through a ſpeaking trumpet, the moſt terrible
                    judgments, if war was not immediately declared againſt the Picts, the murderers
                    of the late king. In conſequence of this celeſtial admonition, war was
                    immediately renewed with great vigour. The Picts were not deficient in their
                    preparations, and had now procured ſome aſſiſtance from England. The firſt
                    battle was fought near Stirling; where the Picts, being deſerted by their
                    Engliſh auxiliaries, were utterly defeated. Druſken eſcaped by the ſwift-<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0733.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0727"/> neſs of his
                    horſe, and a few days after made application to Kenneth for a ceſſation of
                    hoſtilities; but as the Scottiſh monarch demanded a ſurrender of all the Pictiſh
                    dominions, the treaty was inſtantly broken off. Kenneth purſued his good
                    fortune, and conquered the Counties of Merns, Angus, and Fife; but as he marched
                    againſt Stirling, he received intelligence that theſe counties had again
                    revolted, and cut off all the garriſons which he had left, and that Druſken was
                    at the head of a conſiderable army in theſe parts. On this Kenneth battened to
                    oppoſe him, and a negociation again took place. The reſult was equally
                    unfavourable with the reſt. Kenneth inſiſted on an abſolute furrender of the
                    counties of Fife, Merns, and Angus; which being refuſed, both parties prepared
                    for a deciſive battle. The engagement was very bloody and deſperate, the Picts
                    fighting like men in deſpair. Druſken renewed the battle ſeven times; but at
                    laſt was entirely defeated and killed, and the counties in diſpute became the
                    immediate property of the conqueror.</p>
                <p>Kenneth did not fail to improve his victory, by reducing the reft of the Pictiſh
                    territories; which he is ſaid to have done with the greateſt cruelty, and even
                    to have totally exterminated the inhabitants. The capital, called <hi
                        rend="italic">Camelon,</hi> (ſuppoſed to have been Abernethy), held out four
                    months; but was at laſt taken by ſurpriſe, and every living creature deſtroyed.
                    This was followed by the reduction of the Maiden Caſtle, now that of Edinburgh;
                    which was abandoned by the garriſon, who fled to Northumberland.</p>
                <p>After the reduction of theſe important places, the reſt of the country made no
                    great reſiſtance, and Kenneth became matter of all the kingdom of Scotland in
                    the preſent extent of the word; ſo that he is juſtly to be eſteemed the true
                    founder of the Scottiſh monarchy. Beſides this war with the Picts, Kenneth is
                    ſaid to have been ſucceſsful againſt the Saxons, though of theſe wars we have
                    very little account. Having reigned 16 years in peace after his ſubjugation of
                    the Picts, and compoſed a code of laws for the good of his people, Kenneth died
                    of a fiſtula, at Fort Teviot, near Duplin in Perthſhire Before his time the feat
                    of the Scots government had been in Argyleſhire; but he removed it to Scone, by
                    transferring thither the famous black ſtone ſuppoſed to be the palladium of
                    Scotland, and which was afterwards carried off by Edward I. of England, and
                    lodged in Weſtminſter abbey.</p>
                <p>Kenneth was ſucceeded by his brother Donald, who is repreſented as a man of the
                    worſt character; ſo that the remaining Picts who had fled out of Scotland were
                    encouraged to apply to the Saxons for aſſiſtance, pro- miſing to make Scotland
                    tributary to the Saxon power after it ſhould be conquered. This propoſal was
                    accepted; and the confederates invaded Scotland with a powerful army, and took
                    the town of Berwick; however, they were ſoon after defeated by Donald, who took
                    alſo their ſhips and proviſions. This capture proved their ruin; for ſome of the
                    ſhips being loaden with wine, the Scots indulged themſelves ſo much with that
                    liquor, that they became incapable of defending themſelves; the conſequence of
                    this was, that the confederates rallying their troops, attacked them in that
                    ſtate of intoxication. The Scots were defeated with exceſſive ſlaughter. Twenty
                    thouſand of the common ſoldiers lay dead on the ſpot; the king and his
                    princi</p>
                <p>pal nobility were taken priſoners; and all the country from the Tweed to the
                    Forth became the property of the conquerors. Still, however, the confederates
                    found themſelves unable to purſue their victory farther; and a peace was
                    concluded, on condition that the Saxons ſhould become maſters of all the
                    conquered country. Thus the Forth and Clyde became the ſouthern boundaries of
                    the Scottiſh dominions. It was agreed that the Forth ſhould from that time
                    forward be called the <hi rend="italic">Scots Sea;</hi> and it was made capital
                    for any Scotſman to ſet his foot on Engliſh ground. They were to erect no forts
                    near the Engliſh confines, to pay an annual tribute of a thouſand pounds, and to
                    give up 60 of the ſons of their chief nobility as hoſtages. A mint was erected
                    by the Saxon prince named <hi rend="italic">Osbreth,</hi> at Stirling; and a
                    croſs raiſed on the bridge at that place, with the following inſcription,
                    implying that this place was the boundary between Scotland and England:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Anglos a Scotis ſeparat crux ista remotis:</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Arma hic stant Bruti, stant Scoti sub hac cruce tuti.</hi></p>
                <p>After the concluſion of this treaty, ſo humiliating to the Scots, the Picts,
                    finding that their intereſt had been entirely neglected, fled to Norway, while
                    thole who remained in England were maſſacred. Donald flιared the common fate of
                    unfortunate princes, being dethroned and ſhut up in priſon, where he at laſt put
                    an end to his own life in the year 858. —In juſtice to this unhappy monarch,
                    however, it muſt be obſerved, that the character of Donald, and indeed the whole
                    account of theſe tranſactions, reſts on the credit of a Angle author, namely
                    Boece; and that other writers repreſent Donald as a hero, and ſucceſsful in his
                    wars: but the obſcurity in which the whole of this period of Scottiſh hiſtory is
                    involved, renders it impoſſible to determine any thing ſatisſactory concerning
                    theſe matters.</p>
                <p>Donald was ſucceeded by his nephew Conſtantine, the ſon of Kenneth Mac Alpin, in
                    whoſe reign Scotland was firſt invaded by the Danes, who proved ſuch formidable
                    enemies to the Engliſh. This invaſion is ſaid to have been occaſioned by ſome
                    exiled Picts who fled to Denmark, where they prevailed upon the king of that
                    country to ſend his two brothers, Hungar and Hubba, to recover the Pictiſh
                    dominions from Conſtantine. Theſe princes landed on the coaſt of Fife, where
                    they committed the moſt horrid barbarities, not ſparing even the eccleſiaſtics
                    who had taken refuge in the iſland of May at the mouth of the Forth. Conſtantine
                    defeated one of the Daniſh armies commanded by Hubba, near the water of Leven;
                    but was himſelf defeated and taken priſoner by Hungar, who cauſed him to be
                    beheaded at a place ſince called the <hi rend="italic">Devil’s Cave,</hi> in the
                    year 874.</p>
                <p>This unfortunate action coſt the Scots 10,000 men; but the Danes ſeem not to have
                    purchaſed their victory very eaſily, as they were obliged immediately afterwards
                    to abandon their conqueſts, and retire to their own country; However, the many
                    Daniſh monuments that are ſtill to be ſeen in Fife, leave no room to doubt that
                    many bloody ſcenes have been acted here between the Scots and Danes beſides that
                    above-mentioned.</p>
                <p>Conſtantine was ſucceeded by his brother Eth, ſurnamed the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Svoiſtſooted,</hi> from his agility. Concerning him we find nothing
                    memorable; indeed the accounts are ſo confuſed and contradictory, that it is
                        impoſſible<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0734.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0728"/>
                    to form any deciſive opinion concerning the tranſactions of this reign. All
                    agree, however, that it was but ſhort; and that he was ſuccceded by Gregory the
                    ſon of Dongal, contemporary with Alfred of England, and that both princes
                    deſervedly acquired the name of <hi rend="italic">Great.</hi> The Danes at their
                    departure had left the Picts in poſſeſſion of Fife. Againſt them Gregory
                    immediately marched, and quickly drove them into the north oſ England, where
                    their confederates were already maſters of Northumberland and York. In their way
                    thither they threw a garriſon into the town of Berwick; but this was preſently
                    reduced by Gregory, who put to the ſword all the Danes, but ſpared the lives of
                    the Picts. From Berwick, Gregory purſued the Danes into Northumberland, where he
                    defeated them; and paſſed the winter in Berwick. He then marched againſt the
                    Cumbrians, who being moſtly Picts were in alliance with the Danes. Them he
                    eaſily overcame, and obliged to yield up all the lands they had formerly
                    poſſeſſed belonging to the Scots, at the ſame time that he agreed to protect
                    them from the power of the Danes. In a ſhort time, however, Conſtantine the king
                    of the Cumbrians violated the convention he had made, and invaded Annandale; but
                    was defeated and killed by Gregory near Lochmaben. After this victory Gregory
                    entirely reduced the counties of Cumberland and Weſtmoreland, which, it is ſaid,
                    were ceded to him by Alfred the Great; and indeed the ſituation of Alſred’s
                    affairs at this time renders ſuch a ceſſion by no means improbable.</p>
                <p>We next find Gregory engaged in a war with the Iriſh, to ſupport Donach, an Iriſh
                    prince, againſt two rebellious noblemen. The Iriſh were the firſt aggreſſors,
                    and invaded Galloway; but being repulſed with great loſs, Gregory went over to
                    Ireland in perſon, where the two chieftains, who had been enemies to each other
                    before, now joined their forces in order to oppoſe the common enemy. The firſt
                    engagement proved fatal to one of their chiefs named <hi rend="italic"
                        >Brian,</hi> who was killed with a great number of his followers. After this
                    victory Gregory reduced Dundalk and Drogheda. On his way to Dublin he was
                    oppoſed by a chieftain named <hi rend="italic">Corneil,</hi> who ſhared the fate
                    of his confederate, being alſo killed, and his army entirely defeated. Gregory
                    then became guardian to the young prince whom he came to aſſiſt, appointed a
                    regency, and obliged them to ſwear that they would never admit into the country
                    either a Dane or an Engliſhman without his conſent. Having then placed garriſons
                    in the ſtrongeſt fortreſſes, he returned to Scotland, where he built the city of
                    Aberdeen; and died in the year 892, at his caſtle of Dundore in the Garioch.</p>
                <p>Gregory was ſucceeded by Donald III. the ſon of Conſtantine, who imitated the
                    virtues of his predeceſſor. The Scots hiſtorians unanimouſly agree that
                    Northumberland was at that time in the hands of their countrymen; while the
                    Engliſh as unanimouſly affirm that it was ſubject to the Danes, who paid homage
                    to Alfred. Be this as it will, however, Donald continued to live on good terms
                    with the Engliſh monarch, and ſent him a body of forces, who proved of
                    conſiderable advantage to him in his wars with the Danes. The reign of Donald
                    was but ſhort; for having marched againſt ſome robbers (probably no other than
                    the Danes) who had invaded and ravaged the counties of Murray and Roſs, he died
                    at Forres ſoon after, having defeated and ſubdued them in the year 903. He was
                    ſucceeded by Conſtantine III. the ſon of Eth the Swift- footed, concerning whom
                    the moſt remarkable particular we find related is his entering into an alliance
                    with the Danes againſt the Engliſh. The occaſion of this confederacy is ſaid to
                    have been, that the Engliſh monarch, Edward the Elder, finding the Scots in
                    poſſeſſion of the northern counties of England, made ſuch extravagant demands
                    upon Conſtantine as obliged him to ally with the Danes in order to preſerve his
                    dominions in ſecurity. However, the league ſubſiſted only for two years, after
                    which the Danes found it more for their advantage to reſume their ancient
                    friendſhip with the Engliſh.</p>
                <p>As ſoon as Conſtantine had concluded the treaty with the Danes, he appointed the
                    ρreſumptive heir to the Scottiſh crown, Malcolm, or, according to ſome, Eugene
                    the ſon of the late king Donald, prince of the ſouthern counties, on condition
                    of his defending them againſt the attacks of the Engliſh. The young prince had
                    ſoon an opportunity of exerting his valour: but not behaving with the requiſite
                    caution, he had the misfortune to be defeated, with the loſs of almoſt all his
                    army, he himſelf being carried wounded out of the field; and in conſequence of
                    this diſaſter, Conſtantine was obliged to do homage to Edward for the
                    poſſeſſions he had to the ſouthward of the Scots boundary.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of the reign of Athelſtan the ſon of Edward the Elder, the
                    northern Danes were encouraged by ſome conſpiracies formed againſt that monarch
                    to throw off the yoke; and their ſucceſs was ſuch, that Athelſtan thought proper
                    to enter into a treaty with Sithric the Daniſh chief, and to give him his
                    daughter in marriage. Sithric, however, did not long ſurvive his nuptials; and
                    his ſon Guthred, endeavouring to throw off the Engliſh yoke, was deſeated, and
                    obliged to fly into Scotland. This brought on a ſeries of hoſtilities between
                    the Scots and Engliſh, which in the year 938 iſſued in a general engagement. At
                    this time the Scots, Iriſh, Cumbrians, and Danes, were confederated againſt the
                    Engliſh. The Scots were commanded by their king Conſtantine, the Iriſh by Anlaf
                    the brother of Guthred the Daniſh prince, the Cumbrians by their own ſovereign,
                    and the Danes by Froda. The generals of Athelſtan were Edmund his brother, and
                    Tmketil his favourite. The Engliſh attacked the entrenchments of the
                    confederates, where the chief reſiſtance they met with was from the Scots.
                    Conſtantine was in the utmoſt danger of being killed or taken priſoner, but was
                    reſoued by the bravery of his ſoldiers: however, after a moſt obſtinate
                    engagement, the confederates were defeated with ſuch ſlaughter, that the ſlain
                    are laid to have been <hi rend="italic">innumerable.</hi> The conſequence of
                    this victory was, that the Scots were deprived of all their poſſeſſions to the
                    ſouthward of the Forth; and Conſtantine, quite diſpirited with his misfortune,
                    reſigned the crown to Malcolm, and retired to the monaſtery of the Culdees at St
                    Andrew’s, where he died five years after, in 943.</p>
                <p>The diſtreffes which the Engliſh ſuſtained in their ſubſequent wars with the
                    Danes gave the Scots an opportunity of retrieving their affairs; and in the year
                    944, we find Malcolm, the ſucceſſor of Conſtantine, inveſted with the
                    ſovereignty of Northumberland, on con-<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0735.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0729"/> dition of his holding it as fief of the crown of
                    England, and aſſiſting in defence of the northern border. Soon after the
                    concluſion of this treaty Malcolm died, and was ſucceeded by his ſon Indulfus.
                    In his reign the Danes became extremely formidable by their invaſions, which
                    they now renewed with greater fury than ever, being exaſperated by the
                    friendſhip ſubſiſting between the Scots and Engliſh monarchs. Their firſt
                    deſcent was upon Eaſt Lothian, where they were ſoon expelled, but croſſed over
                    to Fife. Here they were a ſecond time defeated, and driven out; and ſo well had
                    Indulfus taken care to guard the coaſts, that they could not find an opportunity
                    of landing; till having ſeemed to ſteer towards their own country, the Scots
                    were thrown off their guard, and the Danes on a ſudden made good their landing
                    at Cullen, in Banffshire. Here Indulfus ſoon came up with them, attacked their
                    camp, and drove them towards their ſhips. but was killed in an ambuſcade, into
                    which he fell during the pursuit. He was ſucceeded by Duffus, to whom hiſtorians
                    give an excellent character; but, after a reign of five years, he was murdered,
                    in the year 965. He was ſucceeded by Culen the ſon of Indulfus, who had been
                    nominated prince of Cumberland in his father’s lifetime, as heir-apparent to the
                    throne. He is represented as a very degenerate prince; and is ſaid to have given
                    himſelf up to ſenſuality in a manner almoſt incredible, being guilty of
                    incontinence not only with women of all ranks, but even with his own ſiſters and
                    daughters. The people in the mean time were fleeced, in order to ſupport the
                    extravagance and luxury of their prince. In conſequence of this, an aſſembly of
                    the ſtates was convened at Scone for the reſettling of the government; but on
                    his way thither Culen was aſſaſſinated, near the village of Methven, by Rohard,
                    thane or ſheriff of Fife, whoſe daughter the king had debauched.</p>
                <p>The provocations which Culen had given to his nobility ſeem to have rendered them
                    totally untractable and licentious; which gave an occaſion to a remarkable
                    revolution in the reign of Kenneth III. who ſucceeded Culen. This prince, being
                    a man of great reſolution, began with relieving the common people from the
                    oppreſſions of the nobility, which were now intolerable; and this plan he
                    purſued with ſo much ſucceſs, that, having nothing to fear from the great
                    barons, he ordered them to appear before him at Lanerk; but the greateſt part,
                    conſcious of their demerits, did not attend. The king ſo well diſſembled his
                    diſpleaſure, that thoſe who came were quite charmed with his affability, and the
                    noble entertainment he gave them; in conſequence of which, when an aſſembly was
                    called next year, the guilty were encouraged to appear as well as the innocent.
                    No ſooner had this affembly met, however, than the place of meeting was beſet
                    with armed men. The king then informed them that none had any thing to apprehend
                    excepting ſuch as had been notorious offenders; and theſe he ordered to be
                    immediately taken into cuſtody, telling them, that their ſubmitting to public
                    juſtice muſt be the price of their liberty. They were obliged to accept the
                    king’s offer, and the criminals were accordingly puniſhed according to their
                    deſerts.</p>
                <p>About this time Edgar, king of England, finding himſelf hard preſſed by the
                    Danes, found means to unite the king of Scotland and the prince of Cumberland
                    along with himſelf in a treaty againſt the Danes; which gave occaſion to a
                    report that Kenneth had become tributary to the king of England. This, however,
                    is utterly denied by all the Scots hiſtorians; who affirm that Kenneth
                    cultivated a good correſpondence with Edgar, as well becauſe he expected
                    aſſiſtance in defending his coaſts, as becauſe he intended entirely to alter the
                    mode of ſucceſſion to the throne. About this time the Danes made a dreadful
                    invaſion. Their original intention ſeems to have been to land on ſome part of
                    the Engliſh coaſts; but finding them probably too well guarded, they landed at
                    Montroſe in Scotland, committing every where the moſt dreadful ravages. Kenneth
                    at that time was at Stirling, and quite unprepared; however, having collected an
                    handful of troops, he cut off many of the enemy as they were ſtraggling up and
                    down, but could not prevent them from beſieging Perth. Nevertheleſs, as the
                    king’s army conſtantly increaſed, he reſolved to give the enemy battle. The
                    ſcene of this action was at Loncarty, near Perth. The king is ſaid to have
                    offered ten pounds in ſilver, or the value of it in land, for the head of every
                    Dane which ſhould be brought him; and an immunity from all taxes to the ſoldiers
                    who ſerved in his army, provided they ſhould be victorious: but, notwithſtanding
                    the utmoſt efforts of the Scots, their enemies fought ſo deſperately, that
                    Kenneth’s army muſt have been totally defeated, had not the fugitives been
                    flopped by a yeoman and his two ſons of the name of <hi rend="italic">Hay,</hi>
                    who were coming up to the battle, armed with ſuch ruſtic weapons as their
                    condition in life afforded. Buchanan and Boece inform us, that theſe countrymen
                    were ploughing in a field hard by the ſcene of action, and perceiving that their
                    countrymen fled, they looſed their oxen, and made uſe of the yokes as weapons,
                    with which they firſt obliged their countrymen to ſtand, and then annoyed their
                    enemies. The fight was now renewed with ſuch fury on the part of the Scots, that
                    the Danes were utterly defeated; and, after the battle, the king rewarded Hay
                    with the barony of Errol in the Carſe of Gowrie, ennobled his family, and gave
                    them an armorial bearing alluding to the ruſtic weapons with which they had
                    atchieved this glorious exploit.</p>
                <p>In the year 994, Kenneth was murdered at the inſtigation of a lady named <hi
                        rend="italic">Fenella,</hi> whoſe ſon he had cauſed to be put to death. The
                    murder was perpetrated in Fenella’s caſtle, where ſhe had perſuaded the king to
                    pay her a viſit. His attendants waited long near the place; but being at length
                    tired out, they broke open the doors, and found their king murdered: upon which
                    they laid the caſtle in aſhes; but Fenella eſcaped by a poſtern. The throne was
                    then ſeized by an uſurper named <hi rend="italic">Constantine;</hi> who, being
                    killed in battle after a reign of a year and an half, was ſucceeded by Grime,
                    the grandſon of king Duffus; and he again was defeated and killed by Malcolm the
                    ſon of Kenneth, the lawful heir of the Scottiſh throne. After this victory,
                    however, Malcolm did not immediately aſſume the ſovereignty; but aſked the crown
                    from the nobles, in conſequence of a law paſſed in the reign of Kenneth, by
                    which the ſucceſſion to the throne of Scotland became hereditary. This they
                    immediately granted, and Malcolm was accordingly crowned king. He joined himſelf
                    in ſtrict alliance with the king of England; and proved ſo ſucceſsful againſt
                    the Danes in England, that<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0736.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0730"/> Sweyn their king reſolved to direct his whole
                    force againſt him by an invaſion of Scotland. His firſt attempt, however, proved
                    very unſucceſsſul; all his ſoldiers being cut in pieces, except ſome few who
                    eſcaped to their ſhips, while the loſs of the Scots amounted to no more than 30
                    men. But in the mean time, Duncan, prince of Cumberland, having neglected to pay
                    his homage to the king of England, the latter invaded that country in
                    conjunction with the Danes. Malcolm took the field againſt them, and defeated
                    both; but while he was thus employed in the ſouth, a new army of Danes landed in
                    the north at the mouth of the river Spey. Malcolm advanced againſt them with an
                    army much inferior in number; and his men, neglecting every thing but the blind
                    impulſes of fury, were almoſt all cut to pieces; Malcolm himſelf being
                    deſperately wounded.</p>
                <p>By this victory the Danes were ſo much elated, that they ſent for their wives and
                    children, intending to ſettle in this country. The caſtle of Nairn, at that time
                    thought almoſt impregnable, fell into their hands; and the towns of Elgin and
                    Forres were abandoned both by their garriſons and inhabitants. The Scots were
                    everywhere treated as a conquered people, and employed in the moſt ſervile
                    offices by the haughty conquerors; who, to render the caſtle of Nairn, as they
                    thought, abſolutely impregnable, cut through the ſmall iſthmus which joined it
                    to the land. All this time, however, Malcolm was raiſing forces in the ſouthern
                    counties; and having at laſt got an army together, he came up with the Danes at
                    Murdoch, near Balveny, which appears at this day to have been a ſtrong Daniſh
                    fortification. Here he attacked the enemy; but having the misfortune to loſe
                    three of his general officers, he was again obliged to retreat. However, the
                    Daniſh general happening to be killed in the purſuit, the Scots were encouraged
                    to renew the fight with ſuch vigour, that they obtained at laſt a complete
                    victory; but ſuffered ſo much, that they were unable to derive from it all the
                    advantages which might otherwiſe have accrued.</p>
                <p>On the news of this ill ſucceſs, Sweyn ordered two fleets, one from England and
                    another from Norway, to make a deſcent upon Scotland, under the command of
                    Camus, one of his moſt renowned generals. The Danes attempted to land at the
                    mouth of the Forth; but finding every place there well fortified, they were
                    obliged to move farther northward, and effected then purpoſe at Redhead in the
                    county of Angus. The caſtle of Brechin was firſt beſieged; but meeting with a
                    ſtout reſiſtance there, they laid the town and church in aſhes. From thence they
                    advanced to the village of Panbride, and encamped at a place called <hi
                        rend="italic">Karboddo.</hi></p>
                <p>Malcolm in the mean time was at hand with his army, and encamped at a place
                    called <hi rend="italic">Barr,</hi> in the neighbourhood of which both parties
                    prepared to decide the fate of Scotland; for as Moray and the northern provinces
                    were already in the poſſeſſion of the Danes, it was evident that a victory at
                    this time mult put them in poſſeſſion of the whole. The engagement was
                    deſperate, and ſo bloody, that the rivulet which proceeds from Loch Tay is ſaid
                    to have had its water dyed with the blood of the ſlain; but at laſt the Danes
                    gave way and fled. There was at that time in the army of Malcolm, a young prince
                    of the name of <hi rend="italic">Keith</hi><note anchored="true" n="3"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> This prince

                            Caithneſs takes its name.</p></note>
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">(a).</hi> He purſued Camus; and having overtaken him,
                    engaged and killed him; but another Scots officer coming up at the ſame time,
                    diſputed with Keith the glory of the action. While the diſpute laſted, Malcolm
                    came up; who ſuffered them to decide it by Angle combat. In this ſecond combat
                    Keith proved alſo victorious, and killed his antagoniſt. The dying perſon
                    confeſſed the juſtice of Keith’s claim; and Malcolm dipping his finger in his
                    blood marked the ſhield of Keith with three ſtrokes, pronouncing the words <hi

                    been the armorial bearing and motto of the family of Keith<note anchored="true"

                            obſerves, that in all probability the Scots gained two victories over
                            the Danes on the preſent occaſion; one near the place called <hi
                                rend="italic">Karboddο,</hi> already mentioned; and the other at
                            Aberlemno, four miles from Brechin. At both places there are monuments
                            with rude ſculptures, erected moſt probably in memory of a victory. That
                            at Karboddo is called <hi rend="italic">Camus's crοss;</hi> near which,
                            ſomewhat more than a century ago, a large ſepulchre, ſuppoſed to be that
                            of Camus, was diſcovered. It conſiſted of four great ſtones; and had in
                            it a huge ſkeleton, ſuppofed to be that of the Daniſh prince. The fatal
                            ſtroke ſeemed to have been given him on the back part of the head; a
                            conſiderable portion of the ſkull being cut away, probably by the ſtroke
                            of the ſword.</p></note>

                <p>The ſhattered remains of the Daniſh forces reached their ſhips; but being driven
                    back by contrary winds, and proviſions becoming ſcarce, they put aſhore 500 men
                    on the coaſt of Buchan, to procure them ſome food: but their communication with
                    the ſhips being ſoon cut off, they fortified themſelves as well as they could,
                    and made a deſperate reſiſtance; but at laſt were all put to the ſword. The
                    place where this maſſacre happened is ſtill called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Crudane;</hi> being probably an abbreviation of <hi rend="italic">Cruor

                <p>Sweyn, not yet diſcouraged, ſent his ſon Canute, afterwards king of England, and
                    one of the greateſt warrious of that age, into Scotland, with an army more
                    powerful than any that had yet appeared. Canute landed in Buchan; and, as the
                    Scots were much weakened by ſuch a long continued war, Malcolm thought proper to
                    act on the defenſive. But the Scots, who now thought themſelves invincible,
                    demanded to be led on to a general engagement. Malcolm complied with their
                    deſire, and a battle enſued; in which though neither party had much reaſon to
                    boaſt of victory, the Danes were ſo much reduced, that they willingly concluded
                    a peace on the following terms, viz. That the Danes ſhould immediately depart
                    Scotland; that as long as Malcolm and Sweyn lived, neither of them ſhould wage
                    war with the other, or help each other’s enemies;<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0737.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0731"/> and that the
                    field in which the battle was fought ſhould be ſet apart and conſecrated for the
                    burial of the dead. Theſe ſtipulations were punctually fulfilled by Malcolm, who
                    built in the neighbourhood a chapel dedicated to Olaus, the tutelar ſaint of
                    theſe northern nations.</p>
                <p>After all theſe glorious exploits, and becoming the ſecond legiſlator in the
                    Scottiſh nation, Malcolm is ſaid to have ſtained the latter part of his reign
                    with avarice and oppreſſion; in conſequence of which he was murdered at the age
                    of 80 years, after he had reigned above 30. This aſſaſſination was perpetrated
                    when he was on his way to Glamis. His own domeſtics are ſaid to have been privy
                    to the murder, and to have fled along with the conſpirators; but in paſſing the
                    lake of Forfar on the ice, it gave way with them, and they were all drowned,
                    their bodies being diſcovered ſome days after. The latter part of thia account
                    is confirmed by the ſculptures upon ſome ſtones erected near the ſpot; one of
                    which is ſtill called <hi rend="italic">Malcolm's grave-ſtone;</hi> and all of
                    them exhibit ſome rude repreſentations of the murder and the fate of the
                    aſſaſſins.</p>
                <p>Malcolm was ſucceeded, in the year 1034, by his grandſon Duncan I. but he is ſaid
                    to have had another grandſon, the famous Macbeth; though ſome are of opinion
                    that Macbeth was not the grandſon of Malcolm, but of Fenella who murdered
                    Kenneth III. The firſt years of Duncan’s reign were paſſed in tranquillity, but
                    domeſtic broils ſoon took place on the following occaſion. Banquo, thane of
                    Lochaber, and anceſtor to the royal family of Stuart, acted then in the capacity
                    of ſteward to Duncan, by collecting his rents; but being very rigid in the
                    execution of his office, he was way-laid, robbed, and almoſt murdered. Of this
                    outrage Banquo complained as ſoon as he recovered of his wounds and could appear
                    at court. The robbers were ſummoned to ſurrender themſelves to juſtice; but
                    inſtead of obeying, they killed the meſſenger. Macbeth repreſented this in ſuch
                    ſtrong terms, that he was ſent with an army to reduce the inſurgents, who had
                    already deſtroyed many of the king’s friends. This commiſſion he performed with
                    ſuch lucceſs, that the rebel chief put an end to his own life; after which
                    Macbeth ſent his head to the king, and then proceeded with the utmoſt ſeverity
                    againſt the inſurgents, who were compoſed of Iriſhmen, Iſlanders, and
                    Highlanders.</p>
                <p>This inſurrection was ſcarcely quelled, when the Danes landed again in Fife; and
                    Duncan put himſelf at the head of an army, having the thanes Macbeth and Banquo
                    ſerving under him. The Danes were commanded by Sweyn king of Norway, and eldeſt
                    ſon of Canute. He proceeded with all the barbarity natural to his nation,
                    putting to death men, women, and children who fell in his way. A battle was
                    fought between the two nations near Culroſs, in which the Septs were defeated:
                    but the Danes purchaſed their victory ſo dearly, that they could not improve it;
                    and Duncan retreated to Perth, while Macbeth was ſent to raiſe more forces. In
                    the mean time Sweyn laid ſiege to Perth, which was defended by Duncan and
                    Banquo. The Danes were ſo much diſtreſſed for want of proviſions, that they at
                    laſt conſented to treat of a peace, provided the preſſing neceſſities of the
                    army were relieved. The Scots hiſtorians inform us, that this treaty was ſet on
                    foot in order to amuſe Sweyn, and gain time for the</p>
                <p>ſtratagem which Duncan was preparing. This was no other than a barbarous
                    contrivance of infuſing intoxicating herbs into the liquors that were ſent along
                    with the other proviſions to the Daniſh camp. Theſe ſoporifics had their
                    intended effect; and while the Danes were under their influence, Macbeth and
                    Banquo broke into their camp, where they put all to the ſword, and it was with
                    difficulty that ſome of Sweyn’s attendants carried him on board; and we are told
                    that his was the only ſhip of all the fleet that returned to Norway. It was not
                    long, however, before a freſh body of Danes landed at Kinghorn in the county of
                    Fife: but they were entirely defeated by Macbeth and Banquo. Such of the Danes
                    as eſcaped fled to their ſhips; but before they departed they obtained leave to
                    bury their dead in Inchcolm, a ſmall iſland lying in the Forth, where one of
                    their monuments is ſtill to be ſeen.</p>
                <p>Thus ended the formidable invaſions of the Danes; after which Duncan applied
                    himſelf to the adminiſtration of juſtice, and the reformation of the manners of
                    his ſubjects. Macbeth, however, who had obtained great reputation by his ſucceſs
                    againſt the Danes, began to form ambitious deſigns, and to aſpire to the crown
                    itſelf. The fables relating to his uſurpation are ſo well known from the tragedy
                    compoſed by Shakeſpeare which bears the name of <hi rend="italic">Macbeth,</hi>
                    that we ſhall not take notice of them here; but only obſerve, that at laſt
                    Duncan, not knowing he had ſo dangerous an enemy near his perſon, whoſe ſchemes
                    required to be watched, was murdered at Inverneſs by Macbeth, who ſucceeded him
                    in the throne.</p>
                <p>During the greateſt part of the reign of the uſurper, Malcolm, the true heir to
                    the crown of Scotland, kept cloſe in his principality of Cumberland, without any
                    thoughts of aſcending his father’s throne. Macbeth for ſome time governed with
                    moderation, but at laſt became a tyrant. Becoming jealous of Banquo, the moſt
                    powerful ſubject in his dominions, he invited him to an entertainment, and
                    cauſed him to be treacherouſly murdered. His ſon Fleance was deſtined to the
                    ſame fate, but eſcaped to Wales. After him Macduff, the thane of Fife, was the
                    moſt powerful perſon in Scotland; for which reaſon, Macbeth determined to
                    deſtroy him. On this Macduff fled to France; and Macbeth cruelly put to death
                    his wife, and children who were yet infants, and ſequeſtered his eſtate. Macduff
                    vowed revenge, and encouraged Malcolm to attempt to dethrone the tyrant. Macbeth
                    oppoſed them with his whole force; but being defeated in a pitched battle, he
                    took refuge in the moſt inacceſſible places of the Highlands, where he defended
                    himſelf for two years; but in the mean time Malcolm was acknowledged king of
                    Scotland, and crowned at Scone.</p>
                <p>The war between Macbeth and the new king continued for two years after the
                    coronation of the latter; but at laſt he was killed in a ſally by Macduff.
                    However the public tranquillity did not end with his life. His followers elected
                    one of his kinſmen named <hi rend="italic">Lullach,</hi> ſurnamed the <hi
                        rend="italic">Idiot,</hi> to ſucceed him: but he not being able to withſtand
                    Malcolm, withdrew to the north, where being purſued, he was killed at Elſey in
                    Strathbogie, after a reign of four months.</p>
                <p>Malcolm being now eſtablilhed on the throne, began with rewarding Macduff for his
                    great ſervices; and conferred upon his family four extraordinary privileges,<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0738.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0732"/> 1. That they
                    ſhould place the king in his chair of ſtate at the coronation. 2. That they
                    ſhould lead the van of all the royal armies. 3. That they ſhould have a regality
                    within themſelves: and, 4. That if any of Macduff’s family ſhould happen to kill
                    a nobleman un- premeditately, he ſhould pay 24 marks of ſilver, and, if a
                    plebeian, 12. The king’s next care was to reinſtate in their fathers poſſeſſions
                    all the children who had been diſinherited by the late tyrant; which he did in a
                    convention of his nobles held at Forfar. In the time of William the conqueror,
                    we find Malcolm engaged in a dangerous war with England, the occaſion of which
                    was as follows. On the death of Edward the Confeſſor, Harold ſeized the throne
                    of England, to the prejudice of Edgar Atheling the true heir to the crown.
                    However, he created him earl of Oxford, and treated him with great reſpect; but
                    on the defeat and death of Harold, William diſcovered ſome jealouſy of Edgar.
                    Soon alter, William having occaſion to pay a viſit to his dominions in Normandy,
                    he appointed Edgar to attend him, along with ſome other noblemen whom he
                    ſuſpected to be in his intereſt; but on his return to England, he found the
                    people ſo much diſaffected to his government, that he proceeded with great
                    ſeverity, which obliged great numbers of his ſubjects to take refuge in
                    Cumberland and the ſouthern parts of Malcolm’s dominions. Edgar had two ſiſters,
                    Margaret and Chriſtina: theſe, with his two chief friends, Goſpatric and
                    Marteſwin, ſoon made him ſenſible how precarious his life was under ſuch a
                    jealous tyrant, and perſuaded him to make preparations for flying into Hungary
                    or ſome foreign country. Edgar accordingly ſet ſail with his</p>
                <p>mother Agatha, his two ſiſters, and a great train of Anglo-Saxon noblemen; but by
                    ſtreſs of weather was forced into the frith of Forth, where the illuſtrious
                    exiles landed at the place ſince that time called the Queen' <hi rend="italic">s
                        Ferry.</hi> Malcolm no ſooner heard of their landing than he paid them a
                    viſit in perſon; and at this viſit he fell in love with the princeſs Margaret.
                    In conſequence of this, the chief of Edgar’s party repaired, to the court of
                    Scotland. William ſoon made a formal demand of Edgar; and on Malcolm’s refuſal,
                    declared war againſt him.</p>
                <p>William was the moſt formidable enemy the Scots had ever encountered, as having
                    not only the whole force of England, but of Normandy, at his command. However,
                    as he had tyrannized moſt unmercifully over his Engliſh ſubjects, they were much
                    more inclined to aſſiſt his enemies than their own prince; and he even found
                    himſelf obliged to give up the county of Northumberland to Goſpatric, who had
                    followed Edgar, upon condition of his making war on the Scots. This nobleman
                    accordingly invaded Cumberland; in return for which Malcolm ravaged
                    Northumberland in a dreadful manner, carrying off an immenſe booty, and inviting
                    at the ſame time the Iriſh and Danes to join him.</p>
                <p>Even at this time the Danes kept up their claims upon the crown of England, ſb
                    that they could not be ſuppoſed very zealous for the intereſt of Edgar. The
                    Iriſh were alſo intereſted in advancing the cauſe of Harold’s three ſons, who
                    had put themſelves under their protection; and beſides, their chief view ſeems
                    to have been to obtain plunder at the expence of any party. However, as all
                    theſe views tended to the pulling down of William’s power, an union was formed
                    againſt him;</p>
                <p>but when they came to particular ſtipulations, the parties immediately diſagreed.
                    The three ſons of Harold, with a body of Iriſh, made a deſcent upon
                    Somerſetſhire, and defeated a body of Engliſh; but the Iriſh having thus
                    obtained an opportunity of acquiring ſome booty, immediately retired with it,
                    after having ravaged the country. The Danes landed at the mouth of the Humber
                    from 40 ſmall ſhips, where they were joined by Edgar and his party; and had the
                    allies been unanimous, it is probable that William’s government would have been
                    overthrown.</p>
                <p>By this time William had taken from Goſpatric the earldom of Northumberland, and
                    given it to Robert Cummin one of his Norman barons; but the Northumbrians having
                    joined Goſpatric, and received the Danes as their countrymen, murdered Cummin
                    and all his followers at Durham, where they had been guilty of great cruelties.
                    After this they laid ſiege to the forts built by William in Yorkſhire; but not
                    being able to reduce them, the Engliſh, Scots, and Danes, united their forces,
                    took the city of York itſelf, and put to the ſword three thouland Normans who
                    were there in garriſon; and this ſucceſs was followed by many incurſions and
                    ravages, in which the Danes and Northumbrians acquired great booty. It ſoon
                    appeared, however, that theſe allies had the intereſt of Edgar no more at heart
                    than the Iriſh; and that all the dependence of this forlorn prince was upon
                    Malcolm, and the few Engliſhmen who had followed his fortune: for the booty was
                    no ſooner obtained, than the Danes retired to their ſhips, and the Northumbrians
                    to their habitations, as though they had been in perfect ſafety. But in the mean
                    time William, having raiſed a conſiderable army, advanced northwards. He firſt
                    took a ſevere revenge upon the Northumbrians; then he reduced the city of York,
                    and put to death all the inhabitants; and perceiving that danger was ſtill
                    threatened by the Danes, he bribed them with a ſum of money to depart to their
                    own country.</p>
                <p>Malcolm was now left alone to encounter this formidable adversary; who, finding
                    himſelf unable to oppoſe ſo great a force, withdrew to his own dominions, where
                    he remained for ſome time upon the defenſive, but not without making great
                    preparations for invading England once more. His ſecond invaſion took place in
                    the year 1071, while William was employed in quelling an inſurrection in Wales.
                    He is ſaid at this time to have behaved with the greateſt cruelty. He invaded
                    England by Cumberland; ravaged Teeſdale; and at a place called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hundreds-keld,</hi> he maſſacred ſome Engliſh noblemen, with all their
                    followers. From thence he marched to Cleveland in the north-riding of Yorkſhire;
                    which he alſo ravaged with the utmoſt cruelty, ſending back the booty with part
                    of his army to Scotland: after which, he pillaged the biſhopric of Durham, where
                    he is ſaid not to have, ſpared the moſt. ſacred edifices, but to have burnt them
                    to the ground. In the mean time Goſpatric, to whom William had had again ceded
                    Northumberland, attempted to make diverſion in his favour, by invading
                    Cumberland: but being utterly defeated by Malcolm, he was obliged to ſhut
                    himſelf up in Bamborough caſtle; while Malcolm returned in triumph with his army
                    to Scotland, where he married the princeſs Margaret.</p>
                <p>The next year William, having greatly augmented<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0739.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0733"/> his army,
                    invaded Scotland in his turn. The particulars of the war are unknown; but it
                    certainly ended much to the diſadvantage of the Scots, as Malcolm agreed to pay
                    him homage. The Engliſh hiſtorians contend that this homage was for the whole of
                    his dominions; but the Scots with more ſhow of reaſon affirm, that it was only
                    for thoſe he poſſeſſed in England. On the concluſion of the peace, a croſs was
                    erected at Stanmore in Richmondſhire, with the arms of both kings, to ſerve as a
                    boundary between the poſſeſſions of William and the feudal dominions of Malcolm.
                    Part of this monument, called <hi rend="italic">Re-croſs,</hi> or rather <hi
                        rend="italic">Roy-croſs,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">The croſs of the
                        kings,</hi> was entire in the days of Camden.</p>
                <p>This peace between Malcolm Canmore and William produced the greateſt alteration
                    in the manners of the Scots. What contributed chiefly to this was the excellent
                    diſpofition of queen Margaret; who was, for that age, a pattern of piety and
                    politeneſs: and next to this was the number of foreigners who had ſettled in
                    Scotland; among whom were ſome Frenchmen, who laid the foundation of that
                    friendſhip with the Scots which laſted for ages. Malcolm himſelf, alſo, though
                    by his ravages in England he ſeems naturally to have been a barbarian, was far
                    from being averſe to a reformation, and even ſet the example himſelf. During her
                    huſband’s abſence in England queen Margaret had choſen for her confeſſor one
                    Turgot, whom ſhe alſo made her aſſiſtant in her intended reformation. She began
                    with new-modelling her own court; into which ſhe introduced the offices,
                    furniture, and manner of living, common among the more polite nations of Europe.
                    She diſmiſſed from her ſervice all thoſe who were noted for immorality and
                    impiety: and charged Turgot, on pain of her diſpleaſure, to give his real
                    ſentiments on the ſtate of the kingdom, after the beſt inquiry he could make. By
                    him ſhe was informed, that faction reigned among the nobles, rapine among the
                    commons, and incontinence among all degrees of men. Above all, he complained
                    that the kingdom was deſtitute of a learned clergy, capable of reforming the
                    people by their example and doctrine. All this the queen repreſented to her
                    huſband, and prevailed upon him to let about the work of reformation
                    immediately; in which, however, he met with conſiderable oppoſition. The Scots,
                    accuſtomed to oppreſs their inferiors, thought all reſtrictions of their power
                    were as many ſteps towards their ſlavery. The introduction of foreign offices
                    and titles confirmed them in this opinion; and ſuch a dangerous inſurrection
                    happened in Moray and ſome of the northern counties, that Malcolm was obliged to
                    march againſt the rebels in perſon. He found them, indeed, very formidable; but
                    they were ſo much intimidated by his reſolution, that they intreated the clergy
                    who were among them to intercede with the king in their favour. Malcolm received
                    their ſubmiſſion, but refuſed to grant an unconditional pardon.. He gave all the
                    common people indeed leave to return to their habitations, but obliged the
                    better ſort to ſurrender themſelves to his pleaſure. Many of the moſt guilty
                    were put to death, or condemned to perpetual impriſonment; while others had
                    their eſtates confiſcated. This ſeverity checked the rebellious ſpirit of the
                    Scots, upon which Malcolm returned to his plans of reformation. Still, however,
                    he found himſelf oppoſed even in thoſe abuſes,</p>
                <p>which were moſt obvious and glaring. He durſt not entirely aboliſh that infamous
                    practice of the landlord claiming the firſt night with his tenant’s bride;
                    though, by the queen’s influence, the privilege was changed into the payment of
                    a piece of money by the bridegroom, and was afterwards known by the name of <hi
                        rend="italic">mercheta mulierum,</hi> or “the woman’s merk.” In thoſe days
                    the Scots were without the practice of ſaying grace after meals, till it was
                    introduced by Margaret, who gave a glaſs of wine, or other liquor, to thoſe who
                    remained at the royal table and heard the thankſgiving; which expedient gave
                    riſe to the term of the <hi rend="italic">grace-drink.</hi> Beſides this, the
                    terms of the duration of Lent and Eaſter were fixed; the king and queen beſtowed
                    large alms on the poor, and the latter waſhed the feet of ſix of their number;
                    many churches, monaſteries, &amp;c. were erected, and the clerical revenues
                    augmented. However, notwithſtanding theſe reformations, ſome hiſtorians have
                    complained, that, along with the manners of the Engliſh and French, their
                    luxuries were alſo introduced. Till this reign the Scots had been remarkable for
                    their ſobriety and the ſimplicity of their fare; which was now converted into
                    exceſs and riot, and ſometimes ended fatally by quarrels and bloodſhed. We are
                    told, at the ſame time, that even in thoſe days, the nobility eat only two meals
                    a-day, and were ſerved with no more than two diſhes at each meal; but that their
                    deviation from their ancient temperance occaſioned a diminution of the ſtrength
                    and ſize of the people.</p>
                <p>In the year 1077, Malcolm again invaded England; but upon what provocation, or
                    with what ſucceſs, is not well known. But in 1088, after the death of the
                    Conqueror, he again eſpouſed the cauſe of Edgar Atheling, who had been reduced
                    to implore his aſſiſtance a ſecond time, when William Rufus aſcended the throne
                    of England. At the time of Edgar’s arrival, Malcolm was at the head of a brave
                    and well-diſciplined army, with which he penetrated a great way into the country
                    of the enemy; and, as it is ſaid, returned to Scotland with an immenſe booty.
                    Some hiſtorians tell us, that in this expedition Malcolm met with a defeat,
                    which obliged him to return; and indeed this is not a little countenanced by
                    others, who ſay, not indeed that he was defeated, but that it was <hi
                        rend="italic">the will oſ God</hi> he ſhould proceed no farther. But, be
                    this as it will, William reſolved to revenge the injury, and prepared great
                    armaments both by ſea and land for the invaſion of Scotland. His ſucceſs,
                    however, was not anſwerable to the greatneſs of his preparations. His fleet was
                    daſhed to pieces by ſtorms, and almoſt all on board of it periſhed. Malcolm had
                    alſo laid waſte the country through which his antagoniſt was to paſs, in ſuch an
                    effectual manner, that William loſt a great part of his troops by fatigue and
                    famine; and, when he arrived in Scotland, found himſelf in a ſituation very
                    little able to reſiſt Malcolm, who was advancing againſt him with a powerful
                    army. In this diſtreſs, Rufus had recourſe to Robert de Mowbray earl of
                    Northumberland, who diſſuaded him from venturing a battle, but adviſed him by
                    all means to open a negociation by means of Edgar and the other Engliſh noblemen
                    who reſided with Malcolm. Edgar undertook the negociation, on condition of his
                    being reſtored to his eſtates in England; but met with more difficulty than he
                    imagined. Malcolm had never yet recognized the right of William Rufus to the
                        throne<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0740.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0734"/> of
                    England, and therefore refuſed to treat with him as a ſovereign prince; but
                    offered to enter into a negociation with his brother Robert, ſurnamed <hi
                        rend="italic">Curt-hoſe,</hi> from the ſhortneſs of his legs. The two
                    princes accordingly met; and Malcolm, having ſhown Robert the diſpoſition of his
                    army, offered to cut off his brother William, and to pay to him the homage he
                    had been accuſtomed to pay to the Conqueror for his Engliſh dominions. But
                    Robert generouſly anſwered, that he had reſigned to Rufus his right of
                    primogeniture in England; and that he had even become one of William’s ſubjects,
                    thereby accepting of an Engliſh eſtate. An interview with William then followed;
                    in which it was agreed that the king of England ſhould reſtore to Malcolm all
                    his ſouthern poſſeſſions, for which he ſhould pay the ſame homage he had been
                    accuſtomed to do to the Conqueror; that he ſhould reſtore to Malcolm 12 diſputed
                    manors, and give him likewiſe 12 merks of gold yearly, beſides reſtoring Edgar
                    to all his Engliſh eſtates.</p>
                <p>This treaty was concluded in Lothian, according to the Engliſh hiſtorians; but at
                    Leeds in Yorkſhire, according to the Scots. However, the Engliſh monarch looked
                    upon the terms to be ſo very diſhonourable, that he reſolved not to fulfil them.
                    Soon after his departure Edgar and Robert began to preſs him to fulfil his
                    engagements; but receiving only evaſive anſwers, they paſſed over into Normandy.
                    After their departure, William applied himſelf to the fortification of his
                    northern boundaries, eſpecially Carliſle, which had been deſtroyed by the Danes
                    200 years before. — As this place lay within the feodal dominions of Malcolm, he
                    complained of William’s proceeding, as a breach of the late treaty; and ſoon
                    after repaired to the Engliſh court at Glouceſter, that he might have a perſonal
                    interview with the king of England, and obtain redreſs. On his arrival, William
                    refuſed him admittance to his preſence, without paying him homage. Malcom
                    offered this in the ſame manner as had been done by his predeceſſors, that is,
                    on the confines of the two kingdoms; but this being rejected by William, Malcolm
                    returned to Scotland in a rage, and prepared again for war.</p>
                <p>The firſt of Malcolm’s military operations now proved fatal to him; but the
                    circumſtances of his death are variouſly related. According to the Scots
                    hiſtorians, Malcolm having laid ſiege to Alnwick, and reduced the place to ſuch
                    ſtraits, that a knight came out of the caſtle, having the keys on the point of a
                    ſpear, and pretending that he deſigned to lay them at Malcolm’s feet; but
                    inſtead of this, he ran him through the eye with the ſpear, as ſoon as he came
                    within reach. They add, that prince Edward, the king’s eldeſt ſon, was mortally
                    wounded in attempting to revenge his father’s death. The Engliſh hiſtorians, on
                    the other hand, contend, that the Scots were ſurpriſed in their camp, their army
                    entirely defeated, and their king killed. On this occaſion the Scots hiſtorians
                    alſo inform us, that the family of Piercy received its name; the knight who
                    killed the Scots king having been ſurnamed <hi rend="italic">Pierce-eye,</hi>
                    from the manner in which he gave that monarch the fatal ſtroke. Queen Margaret,
                    who was at that time lying ill in the caſtle of Edinburgh, died four days after
                    her huſband.</p>
                <p>After the death of Malcolm Canmore, which happened in the year 1093 the throne
                    was uſurped by his brother Donald Bane; who, notwithstanding the great virtues
                    and glorious achievements of the late king, had been at the head of a ſtrong
                    party during the whole of his brother’s reign. The uſurper, giving way to the
                    barbarous prejudices of himſelf and his countrymen, expelled out of the kingdom
                    all the foreigners whom Malcolm had introduced, and obliged them to take refuge
                    in England. Edgar himſelf had long reſided at the Engliſh court, where he was in
                    high reputation; and, by his intereſt there, found means to reſcue his nephew
                    young Edgar, the king of Scotland’s eldeſt ſon, out of the hands of the uſurper
                    Donald Bane. The favour he ſhowed to him, however, produced an accuſation
                    againſt himſelf, as if he deſigned to adopt young Edgar as his ſon, and ſet him
                    up as a pretender to the Engliſh throne. This accuſation was preferred by an
                    Engliſhman whoſe name was <hi rend="italic">Organ;</hi> but, as no legal proofs
                    of the guilt could be obtained, the cuſtom of the times rendered a ſingle combat
                    between the parties unavoidable. Orgar was one of the ſtrongeſt and moſt active
                    men in the kingdom; but the age and infirmities of Edgar allowed him to be
                    defended by another. For a long time none could be found who would enter the
                    liſts with this champion; but at laſt one Godwin of Wincheſter, whoſe family had
                    been under obligations to Edgar or his anceſtors, offered to defend his cauſe.
                    Orgar was overcome and killed: and, when dying, confeſſed the falſehood of his
                    accuſation. The conqueror obtained all the lands of his adverſary, and William
                    lived ever afterwards on terms of the ſtricteſt friendſhip with Edgar.</p>
                <p>This combat, trifling as it may ſeem to us, produced very conſiderable effects.
                    The party of Edgar and his brother’s (who had likewiſe taken refuge at the
                    Engliſh court) revived in Scotland, to ſuch a degree, that Donald was obliged to
                    call in the Danes and Norwegians to his aſſiſtance. In order to engage them more
                    effectually to his intereſt, the uſurper yielded up to them the Orkney and
                    Shetland iſlands; but when his new allies came to his aſſiſtance, they behaved
                    in ſuch a manner as to become more intolerable to the Scots than ever the
                    Engliſh had been. This diſcontent was greatly increaſed when it was found that
                    William deſigned to place on the throne of Scotland a natural ſon of the late
                    Malcolm, named <hi rend="italic">Duncan,</hi> who had ſerved in the Engliſh
                    armies with great reputation. Donald attempted to maintain himſelf on the throne
                    by the aſſiſtance of his Norwegian allies; but, being abandoned by the Scots, he
                    was obliged to fly to the iſles, in order to raiſe more forces; and in the mean
                    time Duncan was crowned at Scone with the uſual ſolemnity.</p>
                <p>The Scots were now greatly diſtreſſed by two uſurpers who contended for the
                    kingdom, each of them ſupported by a foreign army. One of them, however, was
                    ſoon diſpatched. Malpedir, thane of Mearns, ſurpriſed Duncan in the caſtle of
                    Mentieth, and killed him; alter which he replaced Donald on the throne. The
                    affection of the Scots, however, was by this time entirely alienated from
                    Donald, and a manifeſt intention of calling in young Edgar was ſhown. To prevent
                    this, Donald offered the young prince all that part of Scotland which lay to the
                    ſouthward of the Forth; but the terms, were rejected, and the meſſengers who<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0741.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0735"/> Brought them
                    were put to death as traitors. The king of England alſo, dreading the
                    neighbourhood of the Norwegians, interpoſed in young Edgar’s favour, and gave
                    Atheling the command of an army in order to reſtore his nephew. Donald prepared
                    to oppoſe his enemies with all the forces he could raiſe; but was deſerted by
                    the Scots, and obliged to flee: his enemies purſued him ſo cloſely, that he was
                    ſoon taken; and being brought before Edgar, he ordered his eyes to be put out,
                    condemning him at the ſame time to perpetual baniſhment, in which he died ſome
                    time after.</p>
                <p>The hiſtorians of theſe times inform us, that this revolution was owing to the
                    interpoſition of St Cuthbert, who appeared to Edgar, informing him that he
                    ſhould prove victorious, provided he repaired next day to his church, and
                    received his banner from the hands of the canons; which he accordingly did, and
                    proved ever afterwards a moſt grateful votary to his patron. During his reign a
                    ſtrict friendſhip ſubſiſted between the courts of England and Scotland; owing to
                    the marriage of Henry I. of England with the Princeſs Matilda, filler to Edgar.
                    This has given occaſion to the Engliſh hiſtorians to aſſert that Edgar held the
                    kingdom of Scotland as a feudatory of Henry; and to this purpoſe have forged
                    certain writings, by which Edgar acknowledges “That he held the kingdom of
                    Scotland by gift from his Lord William king of England; and with conſent of his
                    ſaid lord, he gives to Almighty GOD, and the church of Durham, and to the
                    glorious biſhop of St Cuthbert, and to biſhop William, and to the monks of
                    Durham, and their ſucceſſors, the manſions of Berwick and Coldingham, with
                    ſeveral other lands poſſeſſed by his father Malcolm: and this charter is granted
                    in the preſence of biſhop William, and Turgot the prior; and confirmed by the
                    croſſes of Edgar his brother, and other noblemen.” But that theſe writings are
                    forged, appears from the non-exiſtence of the original charter, and from their
                    being related in quite a different manner by ſome other authors. —For the ſame
                    purpoſe a ſeal has been forged of Edgar fitting on horſeback, with a ſword in
                    his right-hand, and a ſhield on his left arm, within a border of France. But
                    this laſt circumſtance is a ſufficient proof of the forgery; ſince, in the ſame
                    repoſitory in which this ſeal is kept, there are five charters of the ſame
                    Edgar, which are undoubtedly genuine; and on the ſeals belonging to them he is
                    repreſented ſitting on two ſwords placed acroſs, with a ſceptre in one hand, a
                    ſword in the other, a royal diadem on his head, with this inſcription round it,
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Scotorum Basileus,</hi> which the beſt Engliſh
                    antiquaries allow to have been a title denoting independency.</p>
                <p>After a reign of nine years, Edgar died at Dundee, in the year 1107; and was
                    ſucceeded by his brother Alexander I. ſurnamed the <hi rend="italic">Fierce</hi>
                    from the impetuoſity of his temper. On his acceſſion to the throne, however, the
                    Scots were ſo ignorant of his true character, on account of his appearance of
                    piety and devotion, that the northern parts of the kingdom were ſoon filled with
                    ravages and bloodſhed, by reaſon of the wars of the chieftains with each other.
                    Alexander immediately raiſed an army, and marching into Moray and Roſsſhire,
                    attacked the inſurgents ſeparately; and having ſubdued them all, he put great
                    numbers of them to death. He then ſet himſelf to reduce the exorbitant power of
                    the nobles, and to deliver the common people</p>
                <p>from the oppreſſion under which they groaned. A remarkable inſtance of this
                    appeared on his return from the expedition juſt now mentioned. In paſſing
                    through the Mearns, he met with a widow, who complained that her huſhand and ſon
                    had been put to death by the young earl their ſuperior. Alexander immediately
                    alighted from his horſe, and ſwore that he would not remount him till he had
                    inquired into the juſtice of the complaint; and, finding it to be true, the
                    offender was hanged on the ſpot. Theſe vigorous proceedings prevented all
                    attempts at open rebellion; but produced many conſpiracies among the profligate
                    part of his private ſubjects, who had been accuſtomed to live under a more
                    remiſs government. The moſt remarkable of theſe took place while the king was
                    engaged in building the caſtle oſ Baledgar, ſo called in memory of his brother
                    Edgar, who had laid the foundation-ſtone. It was ſituated in the Carſe of
                    Gowrie, which, we are told, had formerly belonged to Donald Bane, but afterwards
                    came to the crown, either by donation or forfeiture. The conſpirators bribed one
                    of the king’s chamberlains to introduce them at night into the royal
                    bed-chamber: but Alexander, alarmed at the noiſe, drew his ſword, and killed ſix
                    of them; after which, by the help of a knight named <hi rend="italic">Alexander
                        Carron,</hi> he eſcaped the danger, by fleeing into Fife. The conſpirators
                    chiefly reſided in the Mearns, to which Alexander once more repaired at the head
                    of an army; but the rebels retreated northwards, and croſſed the Spey. The king
                    purſued them acroſs that river, defeated them, and brought to juſticc all that
                    fell into his hands. In this battle, Carron diſtinguiſhed himſelf ſo eminently,
                    that he obtained the name of <hi rend="italic">Skrimgeour</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">Skrimzeour;</hi> which indeed is no other than the Engliſh
                    word <hi rend="italic">skirmisher</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fighter.</hi></p>
                <p>The next remarkable tranſaction of Alexander’s reign, as recorded by the Engliſh
                    hiſtorians, was his journey into England, where he paid a vifit to Henry I. whom
                    he found engaged in a war with the Welſh. The occaſion of it was this: Henry had
                    planted a colony of Flemings on the borders of Wales, in order to keep that
                    turbulent people in awe, as well as to introduce into his kingdom the
                    manufactures for which the Flemings were famous. The Welſh, jealous of this
                    growing colony, invaded England; where they defeated the earl of Chtſter and
                    Gilbert Strongbow, the two moſt powerful of the Engliſh ſubjects. Alexander, in
                    virtue of the fealty which he had ſworn for his Engliſh poſſeſſions, readily
                    agreed to lead an army into Wales. There he defeated one of the chieftains, and
                    reduced him to great ſtraits; but could not prevent him from eſcaping to
                    Griffith prince oſ North Wales, with whom he was cloſely allied. Henry alſo
                    marched agamſt the enemy, but with much worſe ſucceſs in the field than
                    Alexander; for he loſt two-thirds of his army, with almoſt his whole baggage, by
                    fatigue, famine, and the attacks of the Welſh. This loſs, however, he made up in
                    ſome meaſure by his policy; for having found means to raiſe a jealouſy between
                    the two Welſh chiefs, he induced them to conclude a peace, but not without
                    reſtoring all his lands to the one, and paying a conſiderable ſum of money to
                    the other. Alexander died in 1124, after a reign of ſeventeen years; and was
                    buried at Dunfermline.</p>
                <p>This prince, dying a bachelor, was ſucceeded by his younger brother David; who
                    interfered in the affairs<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0742.tif"

                    in the civil war ſhe carried on with Stephen. In 1136, David met his antagoniſt
                    at Durham; but as neither party cared to venture an engagement, a negociation
                    took place, and a treaty was concluded. This, however, was obſerved but for a
                    ſhort time; for, in the following year, David again invaded England, on ſome
                    frivolous pretences. He defeated Stephen at Roxburgh; and forced him to retreat
                    precipitately, after loſing one half of his army. Next year he renewed his
                    invaſion; and, though he himſelf was a man of great mildneſs and humanity, he
                    ſuffered his troops to commit ſuch outrages, as firmly united the Engliſh in
                    oppoſition to him. His grand-nephew William cut in pieces the vanguard of the
                    Enghſh army at Clithero; after which he ravaged the country with ſuch cruelty,
                    that the inhabitants became exaſperated beyond meaſure againſt him. New
                    aſſociations were entered into againſt the Scots; and the Engliſh army receiving
                    great reinforcements from the ſouthward, advanced to Northallerton, where the
                    famous ſtandard was produced. The body of this ſtandard was a kind of box which
                    moved upon wheels, from which aroſe the maſt of a ſhip ſurmounted by a ſilver
                    croſs, and round it were hung the banners of St Peter, St John de Beverly, and
                    St Wilfred. Standards of this kind were common at that time on the continent of
                    Europe; and ſo great confidence had the Engliſh in this ſtandard, that they now
                    thought themſelves invincible. They had, however, a much more ſolid ground of
                    confidence, as being much better armed than their antagoniſts. The armies met at
                    a place called <hi rend="italic">Culton Moor.</hi> The firſt line of the Scots
                    army was compoſed of the inhabitants of Galloway, Carric, Kyle, Cunningham, and
                    Renfrew. Theſe by ſome hiſtorians are called <hi rend="italic">Pifts,</hi> and
                    are ſaid to have had a prince of their own, who was a feudatory to David. The
                    ſecond line conſiſted of the Lothian men, by which we are to underſtand the
                    king’s ſubjects in England as well as the ſouth of Scotland, together with the
                    Engliſh and Normans of Maud’s party. The third line was formed of the clans
                    under their different chieftains; but who were ſubject to no regular command,
                    and were always impatient to return to their own country when they had acquired
                    any booty. The Engliſh ſoldiers having ranged themſelves round their ſtandard,
                    diſmounted from their horſes, in order to avoid the long lances which the firſt
                    line of the Scots army carried. Their front-line was intermixed with archers;
                    and a body of cavalry, ready for purſuit, hovered at ſome diſtance. The Picts,
                    beſides their lances, made uſe of targets; but, when the Engliſh cloſed with
                    them, they were ſoon diſordered and driven back upon the centre, where David
                    commanded in perſon. His ſon made a gallant reſiſtance, but was at laſt forced
                    to yield: the laſt line ſeems never to have been engaged. David, ſeeing the
                    victory decided againſt him, ordered ſome of his men to ſave themſelves by
                    throwing away their badges, which it ſeems Maud’s party had worn, and mingling
                    with the Engliſh; after which he himſelf, with his ſhattered forces, retreated
                    towards Carliſle. The Engliſh hiſtorians ſay, that in this battle the Scots were
                    totally defeated, with the loss of 10,000 men; but this ſeems not to be the
                    caſe, as the Engliſh did not purſue, and the Scots were in a condition for
                    carrying on the war next year. However, there were now no great exploits
                    performed on either ſide; and a peace was concluded, by which Henry prince of
                    Scotland was put in poſleſſion of Huntingdon and Northumberland, and took an
                    oath of fealty to Stephen. David continued faithful to his niece the empreſs as
                    long as he lived; and died at Carliſle in the year 1153, after a glorious reign
                    of ſomewhat more than 29 years.</p>
                <p>David was ſucceeded by his grandſon Malcolm IV. ſurnamed the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Maiden,</hi> on account of his continence. He appears to have been a weak
                    and ſuperſtitious prince, and died of a depreſſion of ſpirits in the year 1165.
                    He was ſucceeded by his brother William I. who immediately entered into a war
                    with Henry II. of England, on account of the earldom of Northumber land, which
                    had been given up by Malcolm; but Henry, finding his affairs in a very
                    embarraſſed ſituation, conſented to yield up this county, on William’s paying
                    him homage, rather than continue the miſeries of war. In 1172, he attempted to
                    avail himſelf of the unnatural war which Henry’s ſons carried on againſt their
                    father, and invaded England. He divided his army into three columns: the firſt
                    of which laid ſiege to Carliſle; the ſecond he himſelf led into Northumberland;
                    and the king’s brother, David, advanced with the third into Leiceſterſhire.
                    William reduced the caſtles of Burgh, Appleby, Warkworth, and Garby; and then
                    joined that diviſion of his army which was beſieging Carliſle. The place was
                    already reduced to ſuch ſtraits, that the governor had agreed to ſurrender it by
                    a certain day, provided it was not relieved before that time: on which the king,
                    leaving ſome troops to continue the ſiege, inveſted a caſtle with ſome of the
                    forces he had under his command, at the ſame time ſending a ſtrong reinforcement
                    to his brother David; by which means he himſelf was left with a very ſmall army,
                    when he received intelligence that a ſtrong body of Engliſh under Robert de
                    Stuteville and his ſon were advancing to ſurpriſe him. — WiUiam, ſenſible of his
                    inability to reſiſt them, retired to Alnwick, to which he inſtantly laid ſiege;
                    but in the mean time acted in ſuch a careleſs and unthinking manner, that his
                    enemies actually effected their deſigns. Having dreſſed a party of their
                    ſoldiers in Scots habits, they took the king himſelf priſoner, and carried him,
                    with his feet tied under the belly of a horſe, to Richmond Caſtle. He was then
                    carried in chains before Henry to Northampton, and ordered to be tranſported to
                    the caſtle of Falaiſe in Normandy, where he was ſhut up with other ſtate
                    priſoners. Soon after this an accommodation took place between Henry and his
                    ſons, and the priſoners on both ſides were ſet at liberty, William only
                    excepted, who bore his confinement with great impatience. Of this Henry took the
                    advantage, tp make him pay homage for the whole kingdom of Scotland, and
                    acknowledge that he held it only as a feu of the crown of England; and, as a
                    ſecurity, he was obliged to deliver into the hands of Henry all the principal
                    forts in Scotland, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> the caſtles of Roxburgh, Berwick,
                    Jedburgh, Edinburgh, and Stirling; William at the ſame time agreeing to pay the
                    Engliſh garriſons which were put into theſe caſtles. David, the king’s brother,
                    with 20 barons, who were preſent at the ſigning of this ſhameful convention,
                    were put into the hands of Henry as hoſtages for William’s good faith; after
                    which the king was ſet at liberty, and returned to Scotland.<pb

                    of Scotland were now in the greateſt confuſion. The people of Galloway, at the
                    head of whom were two noblemen or princes called <hi rend="italic">Othred</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Gilbert,</hi> had taken the opportunity of aſſerting their
                    independency on the crown of Scotland; and, having expelled all the Scots
                    officers out of the country, they demoliſhed all the forts which William had
                    erected in their country, and put to death all the foreigners. But in the mean
                    time a quarrel enſuing between the two chiefs, Othred was murdered by Gilbert,
                    who immediately applied to. Henry for protection.</p>
                <p>Henry, in order to give all poſſible fonction to the convention betwixt him and
                    William, ſummoned him to meet him and his ſon at York. William obeyed the
                    ſummons, and along with him appeared all the great nobility and landholders; who
                    confirmed the convention of Falaiſe, ſwore fealty to Henry, and put themſelves
                    and their country under his protection. In the mean time, Gilbert, who was at
                    the head of the rebels in Galloway, had offered to put himſelf and his people
                    under the protection of the king of England, and to pay to Henry 2000 merks of
                    ſilver yeatly, with 500 cows and as many hogs, by way of tribute: however,
                    Henry, that he might oblige his new feudatory William, refuſed to have any
                    concern in the affair. On this, William ordered his general Gilchriſt to march
                    againſt him; which he did with ſuch ſucceſs, that Gilbert was entirely defeated,
                    and Galloway again reduced under the dominion of Scotland. Very ſoon after this
                    victory, Gilchriſt fell under the king’s diſpleaſure on the following occaſion.
                    He had married Matilda, ſiſter to William; and on ſuſpicion, or proof, of her
                    incontinence, put her to death at a village called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Maynes,</hi> near Dundee. The king being highly diſpleaſed at ſuch a groſs
                    affront to himſelf, ſummoned Gilchriſt to take his trial for the murder: but as
                    the general did not chooſe to make his appearance, his eſtates were confiſcated,
                    his caſtles demoliſhed, and he himſelf baniſhed. He took refuge in England; but
                    as it had been agreed in the convention between William and Henry that the one
                    ſhould not harbour the traiterous ſubjects of the other, Gilchriſt was forced to
                    return to Scotland with his two ſons. There they were expoſed to all the
                    miſeries of indigence, and in perpetual fear of being diſcovered, ſo that they
                    were obliged to ſkulk from place to place. William, on his return from an
                    expedition againſt an uſurper whom he had defeated, happened to obſerve three
                    ſtrangers, who, though diſguiſed like ruſtics, appeared by their noble mien to
                    be above the vulgar rank. William, who firſt diſcovered them, was confirmed in
                    this apprehenſion, by feeing them ſtrike out of the high road, and endeavour to
                    avoid notice. He ordered them to be ſeized and brought before him. The oldeſt,
                    who was Gilchriſt himſelf, fell upon his knees before him, and gave ſuch a
                    detail of his misfortunes as drew tears from the eyes of all preſent; and the
                    king reſtored him to his former honours and eſtates. From the family of this
                    Gilchriſt that of the Ogilvies is ſaid to be deſcended.</p>
                <p>The Scots continued to be in ſubjection to the Engliſh until the acceſſion of
                    Richard I. This monarch being a man of romantic valour, zealouſly undertook an
                    expedition into the Holy Land againſt the Turks, according to the ſuperſtition
                    of the times. That he</p>
                <p>might ſecure the quiet of his dominions in his abſence, he determined to make the
                    king of Scotland his friend; and for this purpoſe, histhought nothing could be
                    more acceptable than releaſing him and his ſubjects from that ſubjection which
                    even the Engliſh themſelves conſidered as forced and unjuſt. However, he
                    determined not to loſe this opportunity of ſupplying himſelf with a ſum of
                    money, which could not but be abſolutely neceſſary in ſuch an expenſive and
                    dangerous undertaking. He therefore made William pay him 10,000 merks for this
                    releaſe: after which he entered into a convention, which is ſtill extant; and in
                    this he acknowledges, that “all the conventions and acts of ſubmiſſion from
                    William to the crown of England had been extorted from him by unprecedented
                    writings and dureſſe” This tranſaction happened in the year 1189.</p>
                <p>The generoſity of Richard met with a grateful return from William; for when
                    Richard was impriſoned by the emperor of Germany in his return from the Holy
                    Land, the king of Scotland ſent an army to aſſiſt his regency aginſt his
                    rebellious brother John, who had wickedly uſurped the throne of England. For
                    this Richard owned his obligation in the higheſt degree; but William afterwards
                    made this an handle for ſuch high demands as could not be complied with.
                    Nevertheleſs, the two monarchs continued in friendſhip as long as Richard lived.
                    Some differences happened with King John about the poſſeſſion of Northumberland
                    and other northern counties: but theſe were all finally adjuſted to the mutual
                    ſatisfaction of both parties; and William continued a faithful ally of the
                    Engliſh monarch till his death, which happened in the year 1214, after a reign
                    of 49 years.</p>
                <p>William was ſucceeded by his ſon Alexander II. a youth of 16. He revived his
                    claim to Northumberland and the other northern counties of England; but John,
                    ſuppoſing that he had now thoroughly ſubdued the Engliſh, not only refuſed to
                    conſider the demands of Alexander, but made preparations for invading Scotland.
                    John had given all the country between Scotland and the river Tees to Hugh de
                    Baliol and another nobleman, upon condition of their defending it againſt the
                    Scots. Alexander fell upon Northumberland, which he eaſily reduced, while John
                    invaded Scotland. Alexander retired to Melros, in order to defend his own
                    country; upon which John burnt the towns of Wark, Alnwick, and Morpeth, and took
                    the ſtrong caſtles of Roxburgh and Berwick. He next plundered the abbey of
                    Coldingham, reduced Dunbar and Haddington, ravaging the country as he paſſed
                    along. His next operation was directed againſt Edinburgh; but being oppoſed by
                    Alexander at the head of an army, he precipitately marched back. Alexander did
                    not fail to purſue; and John, to cover his retreat, burnt the towns of Berwick
                    and Coldingham. In this retreat the king of England himſelf ſet his men an
                    example of barbarity, by ſetting fire every morning to the houſe in which he had
                    lodged the preceding night. In ſhort, ſuch deſolation did John ſpread all around
                    him, that Alexander found it impoſſible to continue his purſuit; for which
                    reaſon he marched weſtward, and invaded England by the way of Carliſle. This
                    place he took and fortified; after which he marched ſouth as far as Richmond,
                    receiving homage from all the great barons as he went<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0744.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0738"/> along. At
                    Richmond he was again flopped by John’s ravages, and obliged to return, through
                    Weſtmoreland to his own dominions.</p>
                <p>When the Engliſh barons found it neceſſary to put themſelves under the protection
                    of Louis, ſon to the king of France, that prince, among other acts of
                    ſovereignty, ſummoned Alexander to do him homage; but the latter being then,
                    engaged in the ſiege of Carliſle, which had fallen into the hands of King John,
                    he could not immediately attend. In a ſhort time Alexander found himſelf obliged
                    to abandon this enterpriſe: after which he laid ſiege to Barnard caſtle; but
                    being baffled here alſo, marched ſouthwards through the whole kingdom of
                    England, and met Louis at London or- Dover, where the prince confirmed to him
                    the rights to Northumberland, Cumberland, and Weſtmoreland. He continued a
                    faithful ally to Louis and the barons in their wars with John; and, in 1216,
                    brought a freſh army to their aſſiſtance, when their affairs were almoſt
                    deſperate. This once more turned the ſcale againſt John; but he ſoon after
                    dying, the Engliſh eaſily became reconciled to the government of Henry III. and
                    the party of Louis dwindled every day, till at laſt he was obliged to drop all
                    thoughts of being king of England.</p>
                <p>As long as Louis continued in England, Alexander proved faithful to his intereſt;
                    but, in 1217, he was on ſuch good terms with Henry as to demand his eldeſt
                    ſiſter, the Princeſs Joan, for a wife. His requeſt was granted, and in 1221 he
                    eſpouſed the princeſs; while his eldeſt ſiſter Margery was married to Hubert de
                    Burgh juſticiary of England, and his ſecond ſiſter to Gilbert earl Marſhal, the
                    two greateſt ſubjects in England.</p>
                <p>As long as the queen of Scotland lived, a perfect harmony ſubſiſted between the
                    Scots and Engliſh: but in 1239 Queen Joan died without children; and Alexander
                    ſoon after married Mary, the daughter of Egeland de Coucy, a young and beautiful
                    French lady, by whom he had a ſon named <hi rend="italic">Alexander,</hi> in
                    1241. From this time a coolneſs took place between the two courts, and many
                    differences aroſe; but no hoſtilities were commenced on either ſide during the
                    lifetime of Alexander, who died in 1249 in the 35th year of his reign.</p>
                <p>Immediately after the death of his father, Alexander III. took poffeſſion of the
                    throne. He is the firſt of the Scots kings of whoſe coronation we have any
                    particular account. We are told, that the ceremony was performed by the biſhop
                    of St Andrew’s, who girded the king with a military belt, probably as an emblem
                    of his temporal juriſdiction. He then explained in Latin, and afterwards in
                    Gaelic, the laws and oaths relating to the king; who agreed to and received them
                    all with great appearance of joy, as he alſo did the benediction and ceremony of
                    coronation from the ſame prelate. After the ceremony was performed, a
                    Highlander, probably one of thoſe who went under the denomination of <hi
                        rend="italic">Sannachies,</hi> repeated on his knees before the throne, in
                    his own language, the genealogy of Alexander and his anceſtors, up to the firſt
                    king of Scotland.</p>
                <p>In 1250, the king, though no more than ten years of age, was married to the
                    daughter of Henry, who now thought it a proper opportunity to cauſe him do
                    homage for the whole kingdom of Scotland. But Alexander, notwithſtanding his
                    youth, replied with great ſenſe and modeſty, that his buſineſs in England was
                    matrimony; that he had come thither under Henry’s protection and invitation; and
                    that he was no way prepared to anſwer inch a difficult queſtion.</p>
                <p>Henry ſeems to have been encouraged to make this attempt by the diſtracted ſtate
                    of the Scots affairs at that time; for, during the minority of the king, the
                    nobility threw every thing into confuſion by their diſſenſions with one another.
                    The family of Cummin were now become exceedingly powerful; and Alexander II. is
                    blamed by Buchanan for allowing them to obtain ſuch an exorbitant degree of
                    power, by which they were enabled almoſt to ſhake the foundation of government,
                    Notwithſtanding the king’s refuſal to ſubmit to the homage required of him, they
                    imagined that Henry’s influence was now too great; and fearing bad conſequences
                    to themſelves, they withdrew from York, leaving Henry in full poſſeſſion of his
                    ſon-in-law’s perſon. Henry, however, to ſhow that he deſerved all the confidence
                    which could be repoſed m him, publicly declared, that he dropped all claim of
                    ſuperiority with regard to the crown of Scotland, and that he would ever
                    afterwards act as the father and guardian of his ſon-in-law; confirming his
                    aſſurances by a charter. Yet when Alexander returned to Scotland, he found they
                    had made a ſtrong party againſt his Engliſh connections. They now exclaimed,
                    that Scotland was no better than a province of England; and having gained almoſt
                    all the nobility over to this opinion, they kept the king and queen as two
                    ſtate-priſoners in the caſtle of Edinburgh. Henry had ſecret intelligence of
                    theſe proceedings; and his queen privately lent a phyſician whom ſhe could
                    truſt, to inquire into her daughter’s ſituation. Having found means of being
                    admitted into the young queen’s preſence, ſhe gave him a moſt lamentable account
                    of her ſituation. She ſaid, that the place of their confinement was very
                    unwholeſome, in conſequence of which their health was in imminent danger; and
                    that they had no concern in the affairs of government. Hiſtorians do not inform
                    us by what means they were reduced to this diſmal ſituation; only in general,
                    that the Cummins uſurped the whole power of the ſtate. Henry did not well know
                    how to act. If he proceeded at once to violent meaſures, he was afraid of the
                    lives of his daughter and ſon-in-law; and, on the other hand, by a more cautious
                    conduct, he leſt them expoſed to the wicked attempts of thoſe who kept them in
                    thraldom, ſome of whom, he very well knew, had deſigns on the crown itſelf. By
                    advice of the Scots royaliſts, among whom were the earls of Dunbar, Fife,
                    Stratherne, Carric, and Robert de Bruce, Henry aſſembled his military tenants at
                    York, from whence he himſelf advanced to Newcaſtle, where he publiſhed a
                    maniſeſto, diſclaiming all deſigns againſt the peace or independency of
                    Scotland; declaring, that the forces which had been collected at York were
                    deſigned to maintain both; and that all he meant was to have an interview with
                    the king and queen upon the borders. From Newcaſtle he proceeded to Wark, where
                    he privately diſpatched the Earl of Gloceſter, with his favourite John Manſel,
                    and a train of truſty followers, to gain admiſſion into the caſtle of Edinburgh,
                    which was then held by John Baliol and Robert de Roſs, noblemen of great
                    influence both in England and Scotland. The Earl and Manſel<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0745.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0739"/> gained
                    admittance into the caſtle in diſguiſe, on pretence of their being tenants to
                    Baliol and Roſs; and their followers obtained acceſs on the ſame account,
                    without any ſuſpicion, till they were ſufficiently numerous to have maſtered the
                    garriſon, had they met with any reſiſtance. The queen immediately informed them
                    of the thraldom and tyranny in which ſhe had been kept; and among other things
                    declared, that ſhe was ſtill a virgin, as her jailors obliged her to keep
                    ſeparate from her huſband. The Engliſh, being matters of the caſtle, ordered a
                    bed to be prepared that very night for the king and queen; and Henry, hearing of
                    the ſucceſs of his party, ſent a ſafe-conduct for the royal pair to meet him at
                    Alnwick. Robert de Roſs was ſummoned by Henry to anſwer for his conduct; but
                    throwing himſelf at the king’s feet, he was puniſhed only by the ſequeſtration
                    of his eſtate, as was John Baliol by a heavy fine, which the king of England
                    reſerved entirely to his own uſe.</p>
                <p>Alexander and his queen were attended to Alnwick by the heads of their party; and
                    when they arrived, it was agreed that Henry ſhould act as his ſon-in-law’s
                    guardian; in conſequence of which, ſeveral regulations were made in order to
                    ſuppreſs the exorbitant power of the Cummins. That ambitious family, however,
                    were all this time privately ſtrengthening their party in Scotland, though they
                    outwardly appeared ſatisfied with the arrangements which had been made. This
                    rendered Alexander ſecure; ſo that, being off his guard, he was ſurpriſed when
                    aſleep in the caſtle of Kinroſs by the earl of Menteith, who carried him to
                    Stirling. The Cummins were joined in this treaſon by Sir Hugh de Abernethy, Sir
                    David Lochore, and Sir Hugh de Barclay; and, in the mean time, the whole nation
                    was thrown into the utmoſt confuſion. The great ſeal was forcibly taken from
                    Robert Stuterville, ſubſtitute to the chancellor the biſhop of Dunkeld; the
                    eſtates of the Toyaliſts were plundered; and even the churches were not ſpared.
                    The king at laſt was delivered by the death of the earl of Menteith, who is ſaid
                    to have been poiſoncd by his wife, in order to gratify her paſſion for young
                    Engliſh gentleman named <hi rend="italic">John Ruſſel.</hi> This charge,
                    however, was never proved; but it is certain that the earl died at a juncture
                    very critical for Scotland, and that his death diſconcerted all the ſchemes of
                    his party, which never afterwards could make head againſt the royaliſts.</p>
                <p>Alexander being thus reſtored to the exerciſe of regal authority, acted with
                    great wiſdom and moderation. He pardoned the Cummins and their adherents, upon
                    their ſubmitting to his authority; after which, he applied himſelf to the
                    regulation of his other affairs: but a ſtorm was now ready to break upon him
                    from another quarter. We have already ſeen, that the uſurper Donald Bane,
                    brother to Malcom Canmore, had engaged to deliver up the iſles of Orkney and
                    Shetland to the king of Norway, for aſſiſting him in making good his pretenſions
                    to the crown of Scotland. Haquin, the king of Norway, at this time alleged, that
                    theſe engagements extended to the delivering up the Hands of Bute, Arran, and
                    others in the Frith of Clyde, as belonging to the Ebudae or Weitem iſles; and as
                    Alexander did not think proper to comply with theſe demands, the Norwegian
                    monarch appeared with a fleet of 160 fail, having on board 20, 000 troops,</p>
                <p>who landed and took the caſtle of Air. Alexander immediately diſpatched
                    ambaſſadors to enter into a treaty with Haquin; but the latter, fluſhed with
                    ſucceſs, would hearken to no terms. He made himſelf maſter of the iſles' of Bute
                    and Arran; after which he paſſed over to Cunningham. Alexander, preparcd to
                    oppoſe him, divided his army into three bodies. The firſt was commanded by
                    Alexander high ſteward of Scotland (the great grandfather of Robert II. ), and
                    conſiſted of the Argyle, Athol, Lenox, and Galloway men. The ſecond was compoſed
                    of the inhabitants of Lothian, Fife, Merſe, Berwick, and Stirling, under the
                    command of Patrick earl of Dunbar. The king himſelf led the centre, which
                    conſiſted of the inhabitants of Perthſhire, Angus, Mearns, and the northern
                    counties. — Haquin, who was an excellent commander, diſpoſed his men in order of
                    battle, and the engagement began at a place called <hi rend="italic">Largs.</hi>
                    Both parties fought with great reſolution; but at laſt the Norwegians were
                    defeated with dreadful ſlaughter, no fewer than 16,00 of them being killed on
                    the ſpot. The remainder eſcaped to their ſhips; which were ſo completely wrecked
                    the day after, that Haquin could ſcarce find a veffel to carry him with a few
                    friends to Orkney, where he ſoon after died of grief.</p>
                <p>In conſequence of this victory, Owen or John king of the iſland of Man ſubmitted
                    to Alexander; and his example was followed by ſeveral other princes of the
                    iſlands belonging to the Norwegians. Haquin’s ſon, Magnus, a wiſe and learned
                    prince, ſoon after arrived in Scotland with freſh reinforcements, and propoſed a
                    treaty: but Alexander, inſtead of liſtening to an accommodation, ſent the earls
                    of Buchan and Murray, with Allen the chamberlain, and a conſiderable body of
                    men, to the weſtern iſlands, where they put to the ſword ſome of the
                    inhabitants, and hanged their chiefs for having encouraged the Norwegian
                    invaſion. In the mean time, Magnus returned to Norway; where a treaty was at
                    laſt concluded between him and Alexander. By this Magnus renounced all right to
                    the conteſted iſlands; Alexander at the ſame time conſenting to pay him 1000
                    merks of ſilver in the ſpace of two years, and 100 yearly ever after, as an
                    acknowledgement for theſe iſlands. To cement the friendſhip more firmly, a
                    marriage was concluded between Margaret the daughter of Alexander, and Eric the
                    ſon and heir of Magnus, who was alſo a child; and, ſome years after, when the
                    parties were of proper age, the marriage was conſummated.</p>
                <p>From this time to the acceſſion of Edward I. of England, we find nothing
                    remarkable in the hiſtory of Scotland. That prince, however, proved a more cruel
                    enemy to this country than it had ever experienced. Alexander was preſent at the
                    coronation of Edward, who was then newly arrived from the Holy Land, where he
                    had been on a cruſade. Soon after this Alexander paid him homage for his Engliſh
                    eſtates; particularly for the lands and lordſhip of Penrith and others, which
                    Henry had given him along with his daughter. He proved an excellent ally to
                    Edward in his wars againſt the French; and the latter paſſed a charter, by which
                    he acknowledged that the ſervices of the king of Scotland in thoſe wars were not
                    in conſequence of his holding lands in England, but as an ally to his crown.
                    Even at this time, however, Edward<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0746.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0740"/> had formed a deſign on the liberties of that
                    kingdom; for in the charter juſt mentioned, he inſerted a ſalvo, acknowledging
                    the ſuperiority, by which he reſerved his right to the homage of the kingdom of
                    Scotland, when it ſhould be claimed by him or his heirs. The biſhop of Norwich
                    ſuggeſted this ſalvo: and this was the reaſon why Alexander would not perform
                    the homage in perſon, but left it to be performed by Robert Bruce earl of
                    Carric; Alexander ſtanding by, and expreſsly declaring, that it was only paid
                    for the lands he held in England. —No acts of hoſtility, however, took place
                    during the lifetime of Alexander, who was killed on the 19th of March 1285, in
                    the 45th year of his age, by his horſe ruſhing down the black rock near Kinghorn
                    as he was hunting.</p>
                <p>Both before and after the death of Alexander, the great ſubjects of Scotland
                    ſeemed to have been ſenſible of Edward’s ambitious deſigns. On the marriage of
                    Margaret with Eric prince of Norway, the ſtates of Scotland paſſed an act
                    obliging themſelves to receive her and her heirs as queen and ſovereigns of
                    Scotland. Edward at that time was in no condition to oppoſe this meaſure, in
                    which the Scots were unanimous; and therefore contented himſelf with forming
                    factions among the leading men of the country. Under pretence of reſuming the
                    croſs, he renewed his intrigues at the court of Rome, and demanded leave from
                    the pope to collect the tenths in Scotland; but his holineſs replied, that he
                    could make no ſuch grant without the conſent of the government of Scotland. On
                    the death of Margaret queen of Norway, her daughter, in conſequence of the act
                    above-mentioned, was recognized by the ſtates as queen of Scotland. As ſhe was
                    then but two years old, they came to a reſolution of excluding from all ſhare in
                    the government, not only Edward I. but their queen’s father; and they
                    accordingly eſtabliſhed a regency from among their own number, conſiſting of the
                    ſix following noblemen; viz. Robert Wiſhart biſhop of Glaſgow, Sir James Cummin
                    of Badenoch, ſenior, James lord high ſteward of Scotland, who were to have the
                    ſuperintendency of all that part of Scotland which lay to the ſouth of the
                    Forth; William Fraſer biſhop of St. Andrews, Duncan M'Duff earl of Fife, and
                    Alexander Cummin earl of Buchan, who were to have the direction of all affairs
                    to the north of the fame river. With theſe arrangements Eric was exceedingly
                    diſpleaſed, as conſidering himſelf as the only rightful guardian of his own
                    child. He therefore cultivated a good correſpondence with Edward, from whom he
                    had received conſiderable pecuniary favours; and perceiving that the ſtates of
                    Scotland were unanimous in excluding all foreigners from the management of their
                    concerns, he fell in with the views of the king of England, and named
                    commiſſioners to treat with thoſe of Edward upon the Scots affairs. Theſe
                    negociations terminated in a treaty of marriage between the queen of Scotland
                    and Edward prince of Wales, young as they both were. This alarmed the ſtates of
                    Scotland, who reſolved not to ſuffer their queen to be diſpoſed of without their
                    conſent. It was therefore agreed by the commiſſioners on both ſides, to acquaint
                    them with the reſult of their conferences, and to demand that a deputation
                    ſhould be ſent up for fettling the regency of Scotland, or, in other words, for
                    putting the ſovereign power into the hands of the two kings. As the two parties,
                    however, were within the prohibited degrees of conſanguinity, being firſt
                    couſins, a diſpenſation was applied for to Pope Boniface, who granted it on
                    condition that the peers of Scotland conſented to the match.</p>
                <p>Though the Scots nobility were very much againſt this match, they could not
                    refuſe their conſent to it when propoſed by the father and grand-uncle of their
                    young queen. They therefore appointed the biſhops of St Andrew’s and Glaſgow,
                    with Robert Bruce lord of Annandale, and John Cummin, to attend as their
                    deputies, but with a ſalvo to all the liberties and honours of the realm of
                    Scotland; to which Edward agreed. Theſe: deputies met at Saliſhury with thoſe of
                    England and Norway; and it was at laſt agreed, 1. That the young queen ſhould be
                    ſent from Norway (free of all marriage-engagements) into England or Scotland. 2.
                    That if the queen came to England, ſhe ſhould be at liberty to repair to
                    Scotland as ſoon as the diſtractions of that kingdom ſhould be ſettled; that ſhe
                    ſhould, on her arrival in her own dominions, be free of all matrimonial
                    contracts but that the Scots ſhould engage not to diſpoſe of her in marriage
                    without her father or Edward’s conſent. 3. The Scots deputies promiſed to give
                    ſuch ſecurity as the Norwegian commiſſioners ſhould require, that the
                    tranquillity of the nation ſhould be ſettled before her arrival. 4. That the
                    commiſſioners of Scotland and Norway, joined with commiſſioners from England,
                    ſhould remove ſuch regents and officers of ſtate in Scotland as ſhould be
                    ſuſpected of diſaffection, and place others in their ſtead. If the Scots and
                    Norwegian commiſſioners ſhould diſagree on that or any other head relating to
                    the government of Scotland, the deciſion was to be left to the arbitration of
                    Engliſh commiſſioners.</p>
                <p>The party of Edward was now ſo ſtrong in Scotland, that no oppoſition was made to
                    the late agreement, in a parliament held at Brechin to deliberate upon the
                    ſettlement of the kingdom. It is uncertain whether he communicated in form to
                    the Scottiſh parliament the pope’s diſpenſation for the marriage: but moſt
                    probably he did not; as, in a letter written to him by the ſtates of Scotland,
                    they mention this as a matter they heard by report. On the whole, however, they
                    highly approved of the marriage, upon certain conditions to which Edward was
                    previouſly to agree; but the latter, without waiting to perform any conditions,
                    immediately ſent for the young queen from Norway. This exceedingly diſpleaſed
                    Eric, who was by no means inclined to put his daughter into the hands of a
                    prince whoſe ſincerity he ſuſpected, and therefore ſhifted off the departure of
                    the princeſs till he ſhould hear farther from Scotland. Edward, alarmed at this,
                    had again recourſe to negociation; and ten articles were at laſt drawn up, in
                    which the Scots took all imaginable precautions for the ſafety and independency
                    of their country. Theſe articles were ratified by Edward on the 28th of Auguſt
                    1289; yet, even after the affair of the marriage was fully fettled, he loſt no
                    time in procuring as ſtrong a party as he could. At the head of theſe were the
                    biſhop of St Andrew’s and John Baliol. That prelate, while he was in England,
                    was highly careſſed by Edward, from whom he had great expectations of
                    preferment; and Baliol, having great eſtates in England, conſidered the latter
                    as his ſovereign. The bi-<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0747.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0741"/> ſhop, on his return to Scotland, acted as a ſpy
                    for Edward, and carried on with him a ſecret correſpondence, informing him of
                    all public tranſactions. It appears from this correſpondence, that the Scots
                    were far from being unanimous as to the marriage. Bruce earl of Annandale
                    ſuſpected, for ſome reaſon or other, that the young queen was dead; and, ſoon
                    after Michaelmas 1290, aſſembled a body of forces, and was joined by the earl of
                    Mar and Athol. Intelligence of theſe commotions was carried to Edward by Baliol;
                    and the biſhop of St Andrew’s adviſed Edward, in caſe the report of the queen’s
                    death ſhould prove true, to march a body of troops towards Scotland, in order to
                    ſecure ſuch a ſucceſſor as he thought proper.</p>
                <p>Edward, in the mean time, conſented to allow ambaſſadors to be ſent from Scotland
                    to bring over the young queen; previous to which, he appointed the biſhop of
                    Durham to be lieutenant in Scotland for the queen and her future huſband; and
                    all the officers there, both civil and military, obliged themſelves to ſurrender
                    their employments and fortreſſes to the king and queen (that is, to Edward)
                    immediately on their arrival in Scotland. But while the moſt magnificent
                    preparations were making for the reception of the young queen, certain
                    intelligence of her death was received; but it is not certainly known whether
                    this event happened before the arrival of the ambaſſadors in Norway or after her
                    departure from that country.</p>
                <p>The Scots were thrown into the utmoſt conſternation by the news of their queen’s
                    death; while, on the other hand, Edward was as well prepared as it he had known
                    what was to happen. The ſtate of Scotland at this time indeed was to the laſt
                    degree deplorable. The act of ſucceſſion eſtabliſhed by the late king had no
                    farther operation, being determined by the death of the queen; and ſince the
                    crown was rendered hereditary, there was no precedent by which it could be
                    ſettled. The Scots, in general, however, turned their eyes upon the poſterity of
                    David earl of Huntingdon, brother to the two kings Malcolm the Maiden and his
                    ſucceſſor William, both of whom died without lawful iſſue. The earl had three
                    daughter s. Margaret, the eldeſt, was married to Allan lord of Galloway; the
                    only iſſue of which marriage was Derverguill wife to John Baliol, who had a ſon
                    of the ſame name, a competitor</p>
                <p>for the crown. The ſecond daughter, Iſabella, was married to Robert Bruce; and
                    their ſon Robert was a candidate likewiſe. The third daughter, Ada, had been
                    married to Henry Haſtings, an Engliſh nobleman, and predeceſſor to the preſent
                    earl of Huntingdon. John Haſtings, the ſon of this marriage, was a third
                    competitor; but as his claim was confeſſedly the worſt of the three, he only put
                    in for a third of the kingdom, on the principle that his mother was joint- heir
                    with her two filters<note anchored="true" n="5" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                            understood from the following scheme.</p></note> (C). Several other
                    claimants now ſtarted up. Florence earl of Holland pretended to the crown of
                    Scotland in right of his great grandmother Ada, the eldeſt lawful ſiſter of
                    William, ſometime king; as did Robert de Pynkeny, in the right alſo of his
                    great-grandmother Marjory, ſecond ſiſter of the ſame king William. Patrick
                    Gallightly was the ſon of Henry Gallightly, a baſtard of William; William de
                    Roſs was deſcended of Iſabel; Patrick earl of March, of Ilda or Ada; and,
                    William de Veſci, of Marjory; who were three natural daughters of king William.
                    Roger de Mandeville, deſcended from Aufrie, another natural daughter of William,
                    alſo put in his claim; but the right of Nicolas de Soulis, if baſtardy could
                    give a right, was better than the former. His grandmother Marjory, the wife of
                    Allan le Huiſſier, was a natural daughter of Alexander II. and confequently
                    ſiſter to. Alexander III. John Cummin lord of Badenoch derived his claim from a
                    more remote ſource, viz. Donald Bane, who uſurped the crown about 200 years
                    before this time; but he was willing to reſign his pretenſions in favour of John
                    Baliol. The latter indeed had ſurely the beſt right; and, had the ſucceſſion
                    been regulated as it is in all hereditary kingdoms at this day, he would
                    undoubtedly have carried it. Bruce and Haſtings, however, pleaded that they were
                    preferable, not only to John Baliol the grandchild of Margaret, but alſo to
                    Derverguill her daughter and his mother, for the following reaſon. Derverguill
                    and they were equally related to their grandfather earl David: ſhe was indeed
                    the daughter of his eldeſt daughter; but ſhe was a woman, they were men; and,
                    ſaid they, the male in the ſame degree ought to ſucceed to ſovereignties, in
                    their own nature impartible, preferable to the female.</p>
                <p>Notwithſtanding this number of candidates, how-<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0748.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0742"/> ever, it was
                    ſoon perceived, that the claims of all of them might be cut off excepting two,
                    viz. Baliol and Bruce, of whom the former had the preference with reſpect to
                    hereditary right, and the latter as to popularity. Baliol had ſtrongly attached
                    himſelf to Edward’s party; which being by far the moſt powerful in Scotland,
                    gave him a decided ſuperiority over Bruce. The event was, that Edward, by his
                    own party moſt probably, though, ſome ſay, by the unanimous voice of the Scot’s
                    parliament, was appointed to decide between the two competitors. It ſoon
                    appeared, however, that Edward had no mind to adjudge the crown to any perſon
                    but himſelf; for, in an aſſembly held at Norham on the 10th of May 1291,
                    Brabanzon the chief juſtice of England informed the members, “That his maſter
                    was come thither in conſideration of the ſtate of the realm of Scotland, which
                    was then without a king, to meet them, as <hi rend="italic">direct
                        ſovereign</hi> of that kingdom, to do juſtice to the claimants of his crown,
                    and to eſtabliſh a ſolid tranquillity among his people; that it was not his
                    intention to retard juſtice, nor to uſurp the right of any body, or to infringe
                    the liberties of the kingdom of Scotland, but to render to every one his due.
                    And to the end this might be done with the more eaſe, he required the affent of
                    the ſtates <hi rend="italic">ex abundante,</hi> and that they ſhould own him as
                    direct sovereign of the kingdom; offering, upon that condition, to make uſe of
                    their counſels to do what juſtice demanded. ” The deputies were aſtoniſhed at
                    this declaration, and replied, that they were by no means prepared to decide on
                    Edward’s claim of ſuperiority; but that Edward ought previouſly to judge the
                    cauſe between the two competitors, and require homage from him whom he ſhould
                    chooſe to be king. Edward treated this excuſe as trifling, and gave them till
                    next day to conſider of his demand. Accordingly, on that day, the aſſembly was
                    held in Norham church, where the deputies from Scotland inſiſted upon giving no
                    anſwer to Edward’s demands, which could be decided only by the whole community;
                    repreſenting, at the same time, that numbers of the noblemen and prelates were
                    abſent, and that they muſt have time to know their ſenſe of the affair. In
                    conſequence of this, Edward gave them a delay of three weeks; which interval he
                    employed in multiplying claimants to the drown of Scotland, and in flattering
                    each with hopes, if he would acknowledge his ſuperiority. But when the aſſembly
                    met, according to appointment, on the 2d of June following, they found the place
                    of meeting ſurrounded by a numerous army of Engliſh. Edward had employed the
                    biſhop of Durham to draw up the hiſtorical evidence of his right to the crown oſ
                    Scotland; which has ſince been publiſhed. In this paper mention is made of the
                    fealty and homage performed by the kings of Scotland to the Anglo-Saxon kings of
                    England; but no ſuſſicient evidence is brought of any ſuch homage being actually
                    performed. As to the homage performed by the kings of Scotland from the time of
                    William the Conqueror to that of the diſpute between Bruce and Baliol, the Scots
                    never denied it; but they contended, and indeed with juſtice, that it was
                    performed for the lands which they held from the crown of England; and they
                    alleged, that it was as far removed from any relation to a fealty or homage
                    performed for the crown of Scotland, as the homage</p>
                <p>paid by the Engliſh monarchs to the crown of France was removed from all relation
                    to the crown of England. With regard to the homage paid by William king of
                    Scotland to Henry II. of England, it was not denied that he performed it for the
                    whole kingdom of Scotland: but they pleaded, that it was void of itſelf, becauſe
                    it was extorted when William was a priſoner to Henry; and they produced Richard
                    I.’s charters, which pronounced it to have been compulſive and iniquitous.</p>
                <p>But, however urgent theſe reaſons of the Scots might be, Edward was by no means
                    diſpoſed to examine into their merits. Inſtead of this, he cloſeted the ſeveral
                    pretenders to the crown; and having found them all ready to comply with his
                    meaſures, he drew up the following charter of recognition to be ſigned by them
                    all.</p>

                    Patrick de Dunbar earl of March, John Veſci for his father Nicholas Soulis and
                    William de Roſs, greeting in the Lord:</p>
                <p>“Whereas we intend to purſue our right to the kingdom of Scotland; and to
                    declare, challenge, and aver the ſame before him that hath moſt power,
                    juriſdiction, and reaſon to try it; and the noble prince Edward, by the grace of
                    God king of England, &amp;c. having informed us, by good and ſufficient
                    reaſons, that to him belongs the ſovereign ſeigniory of the ſame; We therefore

                    our ſeals to this writing, made and granted at Norham, the Tueſday after the
                    Aſcenſion, in the yeat of Grace 1291.”</p>
                <p>Edward then declared, by the mouth of his chancellor, that although, in the
                    diſpute which was ariſen between the ſeveral claimants, touching the ſucceſſion
                    to the kingdom of Scotland, he acted in quality of ſovereign, in order to render
                    juſtice to whomſoever it was due; yet he did not thereby mean to exclude himſelf
                    from the hereditary right which in his own perſon he might have to that crown,
                    and which right he intended to aſſert and improve when he ſhould think fit: and
                    the king himſelf repeated this proteſtation with his own mouth in French. The
                    candidates were then ſeverally called upon by the Engliſh chancellor, to know
                    whether they were willing to acknowledge Edward’s claim of ſuperiority over the
                    crown of Scotland, and to ſubmit to his award in diſpoſing of the ſame; which
                    being anſwered in the affirmative, they were then admitted to prove their
                    rights. But this was mere matter of form; for all the force of England was then
                    aſſembled on the borders in order to ſupport the claims of Edward, and nothing
                    now remained but to furniſh him with a ſuſſicient pretence for making uſe of it.
                    He obſerved, that the Scots were not ſo unanimous as they ought to be in
                    recogniſing his ſuperiority, and that the ſubmiſſion, which had been ſigned by
                    the candidates, was not ſuſſicient to carry it into execution; for which reaſon
                    he demanded that all the forts in Scotland ſhould be put into his poſſeſſion,
                    that he might reſign them to the ſucceſsful candidate.</p>

                    with this laſt demand of Edward, the regency of Scotland without heſitation
                    yielded to it alſo; for which they gave the following reaſons. “That whereas
                    they (the ſtates of Scotland) had, with one aſſent, already granted that King

                    them; ſaving to the king of England the homage of him that ſhall be king; ſo as

                    received in the mean time ſhall be kept in the hands of the chamberlain of
                    Scotland that now is, and one to be joined with him by the king of England; ſo
                    as the charge of the government, caſtles, and officers of the realm, may be
                    deducted. In witneſs whereof, &amp;c.”</p>
                <p>For theſe reaſons, as it is ſaid, the regency put into the hands of Edward all
                    the forts in the country. Gilbert de Umfreville alone, who had the command of
                    the caſtles of Dundee and Forfar, refuſed to deliver them up, until he ſhould be
                    indemnified by the ſtates, and by Edward himſelf, from all penalties of treaſon
                    of which he might afterwards be in danger.</p>
                <p>But though Edward had thus got into his hands the whole power of the nation, he
                    did not think proper to determine every thing by his own authority. Inſtead of
                    this, he appointed commiſſioners, and promiſed to grant letters-patent declaring
                    that ſentence ſhould be paſſed in Scotland. It had been all along foreſeen that
                    the great diſpute would be between Bruce and Baliol; and though the plea of
                    Cummin was judged frivolous, yet he was a man of too much influence to be
                    neglected, and he agreed tacitly to refign it in favour of Baliol. Edward
                    accordingly made him the compliment of joining him with Baliol in nominating 40
                    commiſſioners. Bruce was to name 40 more; and the names of the 80 were to be
                    given in to Edward in three days; after which the king was to add to them 24 of
                    his own chooſing. The place and time of meeting were left in their own option.
                    They unanimouſly pitched upon Berwick for the place of meeting; but as they
                    could not agree about the time, Edward appointed the 2d of Auguſt following.
                    Soon after this, the regents reſigned their commiſſions to Edward; but he
                    returned them, with powers to act in his name; and he nominated the biſhop of
                    Caithneſs to be chancellor of Scotland; joining in the commiſſion with him
                    Walter de Hemondeſham an Engliſhman, and one of his own ſecretaries. Still,
                    however, he met with great difficulties. Many of his own great men, particularly
                    the earl of Glouceſter, were by no means fond of increaſing the power of the
                    Engliſh monarch by the acquiſition of Scotland; and therefore threw ſuch
                    obſtacles in his way, that he was again obliged to have recourſe to negociation
                    and intrigue, and at laſt to delay the meeting until the 2d of June in 1292: but
                    during this interval, that he might the better reconcile the Scots to the loſs
                    of their liberty, he propoſed an union of the two kingdoms; and for this he
                    iſſued a writ by virtue of his ſuperiority.</p>
                <p>The commiſſioners having met on the ſecond of June 1292, ambaſſadors for Norway
                    preſented themſelves in the aſſembly, demanding that their maſter ſhould be
                    admitted into the number of the claimants, as father and next heir to the late
                    queen. This demand too was admitted by Edward, after the ambaſſadors had
                    acknowledged his ſuperiority over Scotland; after which he propoſed that the
                    claims of Bruce and Baliol ſhould be previouſly examined, but without prejudice
                    to thoſe of the other competitiors. This being agreed to, he ordered the
                    commiſſioners to examine by what laws they ought to proceed in forming their
                    report. The diſcuſſion of this queſtion was attended with ſuch difficulty, and
                    the opinions on it were ſo various, that Edward once more adjourned the aſſembly
                    to the 12th of October following; at which time he required the members to give
                    their opinions on the two following points: 1. By what laws and cuſtoms they
                    ought to proceed to judgment; and, ſuppoſing there could be no law or precedent
                    found in the two kingdoms, in what manner? 2. Whether the kingdom of Scotland
                    ought to be taken in the ſame view as all other fiefs, and to be awarded in the
                    ſame manner as earldoms and baronies? The commiſſioners replied, that Edward
                    ought to give juſtice conformable to the uſage of the two kingdoms; but that if
                    no certain laws or precedents could be found, he might, by the advice of his
                    great men, enact a new law. In anſwer to the ſecond queſtion they ſaid, that the
                    ſuceeſſion to the kingdom might be awarded in the ſame manner as to other
                    eſtates and great baronies. Upon this, Edward ordered Bruce and Baliol to be
                    called before him; and both of them urged their reſpective pleas, and anſwers,
                    to the following purpoſe.</p>
                <p>Bruce pleaded, 1. That Alexander II. deſpairing of heirs of his own body, had
                    declared that he held him to be the true heir, and offered to prove by the
                    teſtimony of perſons ſtill alive, that he declared this with the advice and in
                    the preſence of the good men of his kingdom. Alexander III. alſo had declared to
                    thoſe with whom he was intimate, that, failing iſſue of his own body, Bruce was
                    his right heir. The people of Scotland alſo had taken an oath for maintaining
                    the ſucceſſion of the neareſt in blood to Alexander III. who ought of right to
                    inherit, failing Margaret the Maiden of Norway and her iſſue. — Baliol anſwered,
                    that nothing could be concluded from the acknowledgment of Alexander II. for
                    that he left heirs of his body; but made no anſwer to what was ſaid of the
                    ſentiments of Alexander III. and of the oath made by the Scottiſh nation to
                    maintain the ſucceſſion of the next of blood.</p>
                <p>2. Bruce pleaded, that the right of reigning ought to be decided according to the
                    natural law, by which kings reign; and not according to any law or uſage in
                    force between ſubject and ſubject: That by the law of nature, the neareſt
                    collateral in blood has a right to the crown; but that the conſtitutions which
                    prevail among vaſſals, bind not the lord, much leſs the ſovereign; That although
                    in private inheritances, which<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0750.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0744"/> are diviſible, the eldeſt female heir has a
                    certain prerogative, it is not ſo in a kingdom that is indivisible; there the
                    neareſt heir of blood is preferable whenever the ſucceſſion opens. —To this
                    Baliol replied, that the claimants were in the court of their lord paramount;
                    and that he ought to give judgment in this caſe, as in the caſe of any other
                    tenements, depending on his crown, that is, by the common law and uſage of his
                    kingdom, and no other. That by the laws and uſages of England, the eldeſt female
                    heir is preferred in the succeſſion to all inheritances, indiviſible as well as
                    diviſible.</p>
                <p>3. It was urged by Bruce, that the manner of ſucceſſion to the kingdom of
                    Scotland in former times, made for his claim; for that the brother, as being
                    neareſt in degree, was wont to be preferred to the ſon of the deceaſed king.
                    Thus, when Kenneth Macalpin died, his brother Donald was preferred to his ſon
                    Conſtantine, and this was confirmed by ſeveral other authentic inſtances in the
                    hiſtory of Scotland. — Baliol anſwered, that if the brother was preferred to the
                    ſon of the king, the example proved againſt Bruce; for that the ſon, not the
                    brother, was the neareſt in degree. He admitted, that after the death of Malcolm
                    III. his brother uſurped the throne; but he contended, that the ſon of Malcolm
                    complained to his liege lord the king of England, who diſpoſſeſſed the uſurper,
                    and placed the ſon of Malcolm on the throne; that after the death of that ſon
                    the brother of Malcolm III. again uſurped the throne; but the king of England
                    again diſpoſſeſſed him, and raiſed Edgar, the ſecond ſon of Malcolm, to the
                    ſovereignty.</p>
                <p>4. Bruce pleaded, that there are examples in other countries, particularly in
                    Spain and Savoy, where the ſon of the ſecond daughter excluded the grandſon of
                    the eldeſt daughter. Baliol anſwered, that examples from foreign countries are
                    of no importance; for that according to the laws of England and Scotland, where
                    kings reign by ſucceſſion in the direct line, and earls and barons ſucceed in
                    like manner, the iſſue of the younger ſiſter, although nearer in degree,
                    excludes not the iſſue of the eldeſt ſiſter, although more remote; but the
                    ſucceſſion continues in the direct line.</p>
                <p>5. Bruce pleaded, that a female ought not to reign, as being incapable of
                    governing: That at the death of Alexander III. the mother of Baliol was alive;
                    and as ſhe could not reign, the kingdom devolved upon him, as being the neareſt
                    male heir of the blood royal. But to this Baliol replied, that Bruce’s argument
                    was inconſiſtent with his claim: for that if a female ought not to reign,
                    Iſabella the mother of Bruce ought not, nor must Bruce himſelf claim through
                    her. Beſides, Bruce himſelf had ſworn fealty to a female, the maiden of
                    Norway.</p>
                <p>The arguments being thus ſtated on both ſides, Edward demanded an anſwer from the
                    council as to the merits of the competitors. He alſo put the following queſtion
                    to them: By the laws and uſages of both kingdoms, does the iſſue of the eldeſt
                    ſiſter, though more remote in one degree, exclude the iſſue of the ſecond
                    ſiſter, though nearer in one degree? or ought the nearer in one degree, iſſuing
                    from the ſecond ſiſter, to exclude the more remote in one degree iſſuing from
                    the eldeſt ſiſter? To this it was anſwered unanimouſly, That by the laws and
                    uſages of both kingdoms, in every heritable ſucceffion, the more remote in one
                    degree lienally deſcended from the eldeſt ſiſter, was preferable to the nearer
                    in degree iſſuing from the ſecond ſiſter. In conſequence of this, Bruce was
                    excluded from the ſucceſſion; upon which he entered a claim for one third of the
                    kingdom: but being baffled in this alſo, the kingdom of Scotland being
                    determined an indiviſible ſee, Edward ordered John. Baliol to have ſeiſin of
                    Scotland; with this caveat, however, “That this judgment ſhould not impair his
                    claim to the property of Scotland.”</p>
                <p>After ſo many diſgraceſul and humiliating conceſſions on the part of the Scots,
                    John Baliol was crowned king at Scone on the 30th November 1292; and ſiniſhed
                    the ceremony by doing homage to the king of England. All his ſubmiſſions,
                    however, could not ſatisfy Edward, as long as the leaſt ſhadow of independence
                    remained to Scotland. A citizen of Berwick appealed from a ſentence of the Scots
                    judges appointed by Edward, in order to carry his cauſe into England. But this
                    was oppoſed by Baliol, who pleaded a promiſe made by the Engliſh monarch, that
                    he ſhould “obſerve the laws and uſages of Scotland, and not withdraw any cauſes
                    from Scotland into his Engliſh courts.” Edward replied, that it belonged to him
                    to hear the complaints made againſt his own miniſters; and concluded with
                    aſſerting his right, not only to try Scots cauſes in England, but to ſummon the
                    king of Scotland, if neceſſary, to appear before him in perſon. Baliol had not
                    ſpirit to reſiſt; and therefore ſigned a moſt diſgraceful inſtrument, by which
                    he declared, that all the obligations which Edward had come under were already
                    fulfilled, and therefore that he diſcharged them all.</p>
                <p>Edward now thought proper to give Baliol ſome marks of his favour, the moſt
                    remarkable of which was giving him ſeiſin of the Iſle of Man; but it ſoon
                    appeared that he intended to exerciſe his rights of ſuperiority in the moſt
                    provoking manner. The firſt inſtance was in the caſe of Malcolm earl of Fife.
                    This nobleman had two ſons, Colban his heir, and another who is conſtantly
                    mentioned in hiſtory by the family- name of Macduff. —It is ſaid, that Malcolm
                    put Macduff in poſſeſſion of the lands of Reres and Crey. Malcolm died in 1266;
                    Colban his ſon, in 1270; Duncan the ſon of Colban, in 1288. To this laſt earl,
                    his ſon Duncan, an infant, ſucceeded. During the nonage of this Duncan,
                    grand-nephew of Macduff, William biſhop of St Andrew’s, guardian of the earldom,
                    diſpoſſeſſed Macduff. He complained to Edward; who having ordered his cauſe to
                    be tried, reſtored him again to poſſeſſion. Matters were in this ſtate when
                    Baliol held his firſt parliament at Scone, 10th February 1292. There Macduff was
                    cited to anſwer for having taken poffeſſion of the lands of Reres and Crey,
                    which were in poſſeſſion of the king ſince the death of the laſt earl of Fife.
                    As his defences did not ſatisfy the court, he was condemned to impriſonment; but
                    an action was reſerved to him againſt Duncan, when he ſhould come of age, and
                    againſt his heirs. In all this defence, it is ſurpriſing that Macduff ſhould
                    have omitted his ſtrongeſt argument, viz. that the regents, by Edward’s
                    authority, had put him in poſſeſſion, and that Baliol had ratified all things
                    under Edward’s authority. However, as ſoon as he was ſet at liberty, he
                    petitioned Baliol for a rehearing; but this being refuſed, he appealed<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0751.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0745"/> to Edward,
                    who ordered Baliol to appear before him in perſon on the 25th of March 1293; but
                    as Baliol did not obey this order, he ſummoned him again to appear on the 14th
                    of October. In the mean time the Engliſh parliament drew up certain <hi
                        rend="italic">ftanding orders</hi> in caſes of appeal from the king of
                    Scots; all of which were harſh and captious. One of theſe regulations provided,
                    “that no excuſe of abſence ſhould ever be received either from the appellant, or
                    the king of Scotland reſpondent; but that the parties might have counſel if they
                    demanded it.”</p>
                <p>Though Baliol had not the courage to withſtand the ſecond ſummons of Edward, he
                    behaved with conſiderable reſolution at the trial. The cauſe of Macduff being
                    come on, Edward aſked Baliol what he had to offer in his own defence; to which
                    he replied, “I am king of Scotland. To the complaint of Macduff, or to ought
                    elſe reſpecting my kingdom, I dare not make anſwer without the advice of my
                    people.”—Edward affected ſurpriſe at this refuſal, after the ſubmiſſions which
                    Baliol had already made him; but the latter ſteadily replied, “In matters
                    reſpecting my kingdom, I neither <hi rend="italic">dare</hi> nor <hi
                        rend="italic">can</hi> anſwer in this place, without the advice of my
                    people.” Edward then deſired him to aſk a farther adjournment, that he might
                    adviſe with the nation. But Baliol, perceiving that his doing ſo would imply an
                    acquieſcence in Edward’s right of requiring his perſonal attendance on the
                    Engliſh courts, made anſwer, “That he would neither aſk a longer day, nor
                    conſent to an adjournment.” — It was then reſolved by the parliament of England,
                    that the king of Scotland had offered no defence; that he had made evaſive and
                    diſreſpectful anſwers: and that he was guilty of manifeſt contempt of the court,
                    and of open disobedience. To make recompenſe to Macduff for his impriſonment, he
                    was ordered damages from the king of Scots, to be taxed by the court; and it was
                    alſo determined that Edward ſhould inquire, according to the uſages of the
                    country, whether Macduff recovered the tenements in queſtion by the judgment of
                    the king’s court, and whether he was diſpoſſeſſed by the king of Scots. It was
                    alſo reſolved, that the three principal caſtles of Scotland, with the towns
                    wherein they were ſituated, and the royal juriſdiction thereof, ſhould be taken
                    into the cuſtody of the king, and there remain until the king of Scots ſhould
                    make ſatisfaction for his contempt and diſobedience. But, before this judgment
                    was publicly intimated, Baliol addreſſed Edward in the following words: “My
                    lord, I am your liege-man for the kingdom of Scotland; that, whereof you have
                    lately treated, reſpects my people no leſs than myſelf: I therefore pray you to
                    delay it until I have conſulted my people, left I be ſurpriſed through want of
                    advice: They who are now with me, neither will nor dare adviſe me in abſence of
                    the reſt of my kingdom. After I have adviſed with them, I will in your firſt
                    parliament after Eaſter report the reſult, and do to you what I ought.”</p>
                <p>In conſequence of this addreſs, Edward, with conſent of Macduff, ſtopped all
                    proceedings till the day after the feaſt of Trinity 1294. But before this, term
                    Edward was obliged to ſuſpend all proceedings againſt the Scots, by a war which
                    broke out with France. In a parliament held this year by Edward, the king of
                    Scotland appeared, and conſented to yield up the whole re</p>
                <p>venues of his Engliſh eſtates for three years to aſſiſt Edward againſt his enemy.
                    He was alſo <hi rend="italic">requested</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ordered</hi>
                    by Edward to extend an embargo laid upon the Engliſh veſſels all over Scotland;
                    and this embargo to endure until the king of England’s further pleaſure ſhould
                    be known. He alſo requeſted him to ſend ſome troops for an expedition into
                    Gaſcony, and required the preſence and aid of ſeveral of the Scottiſh barons for
                    the ſame purpoſe. The Scots, however, eluded the commands of Edward, by
                    pretending that they could not bring any conſiderable force into the field; and,
                    unable to bear his tyranny any longer, they negociated an alliance with Philip
                    king of France. Having aſſembled a parliament at Scone, they prevailed upon
                    Baliol to diſmiſs all the Engliſhmen whom he maintained at his court. They then
                    appointed a committee of twelve, four biſhops, four earls, and four barons, by
                    whoſe advice every thing was to be regulated; and, if we may credit the Engliſh
                    hiſtorians, they watched the conduct of Baliol himſelf, and detained him in a
                    kind of honourable captivity. However, they could not prevent him from
                    delivering up the caſtles of Berwick, Roxburgh, and Jedburgh, to the biſhop of
                    Carliſle; in whoſe cuſtody they were to remain during the war between England
                    and France, as a pledge of his allegiance. Notwithſtanding this, Baliol
                    concluded the alliance with Philip; by which it was ſtipulated, that the latter
                    ſhould give in marriage the eldeſt daughter of the count of Anjou to Baliol’s
                    ſon; and it was alſo provided, that Baliol ſhould not marry again without the
                    conſent of Philip. The king of Scotland engaged to aſſiſt Philip in his wars at
                    his own expence, and with his whole power, especially if Edward invaded France;
                    and Philip on his part engaged to aſſiſt Scotland, in cafe of an Engliſh
                    invaſion, either by making a diverſion, or by ſending ſuccours.</p>
                <p>Puffed up with the hopes of aſſiſtance from France, the Scots invaded Cumberland
                    with a mighty army, and laid ſiege to Carliſle. The men abandoned the place; but
                    the women mounted the walls, and drove the affailants from the attack. Another
                    incurſion into Northumberland proved almoſt as diſgraceful. Their whole exploits
                    conſiſted in burning a nunnery at Lameley, and a monaſtery at Corebridge, though
                    dedicated to their patron St Andrew; but having attempted to ſtorm the caſtle of
                    Harbottle, they were repulſed with loſs. In the mean time Edward, with an army
                    equal in number to that of the Scots, but much ſuperior on account of its
                    diſcipline, invaded the eaſt coaſt of Scotland. Berwick had either not been
                    delivered according to promiſe, or had been reſumed by the Scots, and was now
                    defended by a numerous garriſon. Edward aſſaulted it by ſea and land. The ſhips
                    which began the attack were all either burnt or diſabled; but Edward having led
                    on his army in perſon, took the place by ſtorm, and cruelly butchered the
                    inhabitants, to the number of 8000, without diſtinction of ſex or age. In this
                    town there was a building called the <hi rend="italic">Red-hall,</hi> which
                    certain Flemings poſſeſſed by the tenure of defending it at all times againſt
                    the king of England. Thirty of theſe maintained their ground for a whole day
                    againſt the Engliſh army; but at night the building being ſet on fire, all of
                    them periſhed in the flames. The ſame day the caſtle capitulated; the garriſon,
                    conſiſting of 2000 men, marched out with all the honours<pb

                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> war, after having ſworn never to bear arms againſt
                    England.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, Baliol, by the advice of his parliament, ſolemnly and openly
                    renounced his allegiance to Edward, ſending the following declaration.</p>
                <p>“To the magnificent prince, Edward, by the grace of God, king of England; John,
                    by the ſame grace, king of Scotland.</p>
                <p>“Whereas you, and others of your kingdom, you not being ignorant, or having cauſe
                    of ignorance, by your violent power, have notoriouſly and frequently done
                    grievous and intolerable injuries, contempts, grievances, and ſtrange damages
                    againſt us, the liberties of our kingdom, and againſt God and juſtice; citing
                    us, at your pleaſure, upon every flight ſuggeſtion, out of our kingdom; unduly
                    vexing us; ſeizing our caſtles, lands, and poſſeſſions, in your kingdom;
                    unjuſtly, and for no fault of ours, taking the goods of our ſubjects, as well by
                    ſea as land, and carrying them into your kingdom; killing our merchants, and
                    others of our kingdom; carrying away our ſubjects and impriſoning them: For the
                    reformation of which things, we ſent our meſſengers to you, which remain not
                    only unredreſſed, but there is every day an addition of worſe things to them;
                    for now you are come with a great army upon the borders, for the diſinheriting
                    us, and the inhabitants of our kingdom; and, proceeding, have inhumanly
                    committed ſlaughter, burnings, and violent invaſions, as well by ſea as land: We
                    not being able to ſuſtain the ſaid injuries, grievances, and damages any longer,
                    nor to remain in your fealty or homage, extorted by your violent oppreſſion, we
                    reſtore them to you, for ourſelf, and all the inhabitants of our kingdom, as
                    well for the lands we hold of you in your kingdom, as for your pretended
                    government over us.”</p>
                <p>Edward was preſented with this renunciation by the hands of the intrepid Henry
                    abbot of Aberbrothwick; and as it was favourable to his political views, he
                    received it rather with contempt than anger. “The fooliſh traitor,” ſaid he to
                    the abbot, “ſince he will not come to us, we will go to him.” The abbot had been
                    perſuaded by his enemies, of whom he had many in Scotland, to preſent this
                    letter, in hopes that Edward would have put him to death; but he had addrefs
                    enough to eſcape ſafe out of his hands, without receiving any other anſwer.</p>
                <p>Though this ſcheme of renunciation had been concerted ſome time before, the
                    declaration was not ſent to Edward till after the taking of Berwick. The fate of
                    Scotland, however, after it, was ſoon decided. The Earl of March had taken part
                    with Edward, but the counteſs betrayed his caſtle of Dunbar into the hands of
                    the Scots. Edward ſent a choſen body of troops to recover the place. The whole
                    force of Scotland oppoſed them on the heights above Dunbar; but leaving their
                    advantageous poſt, and pouring down on their enemies in confuſion, they were
                    diſperſed and defeated.</p>
                <p>The caſtle of Dunbar ſurrendered at diſcretion; that of Roxburgh followed the
                    ſame example; the caſtle of Edinburgh ſurrendered after a ſhort ſiege; and
                    Stirling was abandoned. The Scots, in the mean time, were guilty of the greateſt
                    extravagances. During the ſhort interval between the loſs of Berwick and the
                    defeat at Dunbar, an order was made for expelling all the Engliſh eccleſiaſtics
                    who held benefices in England; all the partizans of England, and all neutrals,
                    were declared traitors, and their eſtates confiſcated. But the great ſucceſſes
                    of Edward ſoon put an end to theſe impotent acts of fury. Baliol was obliged to
                    implore the mercy, of the conqueror. Diverted of his royal ornaments, and
                    bearing a white rod in his hand, he performed a moſt humiliating penance;
                    confeſſing, that by evil and falſe counſel, and through his own ſimplicity, he
                    had grievoufly offended his liege lord. He recapitulated his various
                    tranſgreſſions, in concluding an alliance with France while at enmity with
                    England; in contracting his ſon with the niece of the French king; in renouncing
                    his fealty; in attacking the Engliſh territories, and in reſisting Edward. He
                    acknowledged the juſtice of the Engliſh invaſion and conqueſt; and therefore he,
                    of his own free conſent, reſigned Scotland, its people, and their homage, to his
                    liege-lord Edward, 2d July 1296.</p>
                <p>The king of England purſued his conqueſts, the barons everywhere crowding in to
                    ſwear fealty to him, and renounce their allegiance with France. His journey
                    ended at Elgin, from whence he returned ſouth- ward; and, as an evidence of his
                    having made an abſoute conqueſt of Scotland, he carried off from Scone the
                    wooden chair in which the kings were wont to be crowned. This chair had for its
                    bottom the fatal ſtone regarded as the national palladium<note anchored="true"

                            This ſtone is thus deſcribed by W. Hemingford, T. i. p. 37. “Apud

                    well-vouched example which I have found of any outrage on private property

                    be aſſured that the outrage was not diminiſhed in the relation.”</p>
                <p>On the 28th of Auguſt 1296, Edward held a parliament at Berwick, where he
                    received the fealty of the clergy and laity of Scotland. It is ſaid, that while
                    the Engliſh monarch was employed in the conqueſt of Scotland, he had promiſed
                    the ſovereignty to Robert Bruce, lord of Annandale, in order to ſecure his
                    fidelity; but being put in mind of his promiſe, he anſwered, “Have I no other
                    buſineſs but to conquer kingdoms for you?” Bruce ſilently retired, and paſſed
                    his days in obſcurity. Among thoſe who profeſſed their allegiance at this
                    parliament was Robert Bruce the younger, earl of Carrick. After this, Edward
                    took the moſt effectual methods of ſecuring his new conqueſt. He ordered the
                    eſtates of the clergy to be reſtored; and having received the fealty of the
                    widows of many of the Scottiſh barons, he put them in poſſeſſion of their
                    jointure-lands, and even made a decent proviſion for the wives of many of his
                    priſoners. Yet, though in every thing he behaved with great moderation towards
                    the Scots, he committed the government of certain diſtricts, and of the chief
                    caſtles in the ſouth of Scotland, to his Engliſh ſubjects, of whoſe fidelity and
                    vigilance he thought himſelf assured. In order to conciliate the affections of
                    the clergy, he granted to the Scottiſh biſhops, for ever, the privilege of
                    bequeathing their effects by will, in the ſame manner as that privilege was
                    enjoyed by the archbiſhops and biſhops of England. In honour of the “glorious
                    Confeſſor St Cuthbeit,” he gave to the monks of Durham an annual penſion of 40
                    pounds, payable out of the revenues of Scotland, by the tenure of maintaining,
                    before the ſhrine of the ſaint, two wax-tapers of 20 pounds weight each, and of
                    diſtributing twice a-year one penny each to 3000 indigent perſons. At laſt,
                    having ſettled every thing, as he thought, in tranquillity, he departed for
                    England, with all the pride of a conqueror.</p>
                <p>The tranquillity eſtabliſhed by Edward, however, was of ſhort duration. The
                    government of Scotland at that time required many qualities which Edward’s
                    vicegerents had not. Warenne, earl of Surry, who had been appointed governor,
                    took up his abode in England, on pretence of recovering his health. Creſſingham,
                    the treaſurer, was a voluptuous, proud, and ſelfiſh eccleſiaſtic; while Ormeſhy
                    the juſticiary was hated for his ſeverity. Under theſe officers the
                    adminiſtration of Edward became more and more feeble; bands of robbers infeſted
                    the highways, and the Engliſh government was univerſally deſpiſed. At this
                    critical moment aroſe Sir William Wallace, the hero ſo much celebrated in
                    Scottiſh fables, and by which indeed his real exploits are ſo much obſcured,
                    that it is difficult to give an authentic relation of them. The moſt probable
                    account is, that</p>
                <p>he was the younger ſon of a gentleman (Wallace of Ellerſlie) in the neighbourhood
                    of Paiſley. Having been outlawed for ſome offence (generally ſuppoſed to have
                    been the killing of an Engliſhman), he aſſociated with a few companions, of
                    fortunes equally deſperate with his own. Wallace himſelf was endowed with great
                    ſtrength and courage, and an active and ambitious ſpirit; and by his affability,
                    eloquence, and wiſdom, he maintained an authority over the rude and
                    undiſciplined multitudes who flocked to his ſtandard. In May 1297, he began to
                    infeſt the Engliſh quarters; and being ſucceſsful in his predatory incurſions,
                    his party became more numerous, and he was joined by Sir William Douglas. With
                    their united forces, theſe two allies attempted to ſurpriſe Ormeſhy the
                    juſticiary, while he held his courts at Scone; but he ſaved himſelf by a
                    precipitate flight. After this the Scots roved over the whole country, aſſaulted
                    caſtles, and maſſacred the Engliſh. Their party was joined by many perſons of
                    rank; among whom were Robert Wiſheart biſhop of Glaſgow, the Steward of Scotland
                    and his brother Alexander de Lindſay, Sir Richard Lundin, and Sir Andrew Moray
                    of Bothwell. Young Bruce would have been a vaſt acceſſion to the party; for he
                    poſſeſſed all Carrick and Annandale, ſo that his territories reached from the
                    frith of Clyde to Solway. But the wardens of the weſtern marches of England
                    ſuſpected his fidelity, and ſummoned him to Carliſle. He obeyed, and made oath
                    on the conſecrated hoſt, and on the ſword of Becket, to be faithful and vigilant
                    in the cauſe of Edward; and to prove his ſincerity, he invaded with fire and
                    ſword the eſtate of Sir William Douglas, and carried off his wife and children.
                    However, he inſtantly repented of what he had done: “I truſt (ſaid he), that the
                    pope will abſolve me from an extorted oath;” on which he abandoned Edward, and
                    joined the Scottiſh army.</p>
                <p>All this time Edward was in France, not in the leaſt ſuſpecting an inſurrection
                    among people whom he imagined he had thoroughly ſubdued. As ſoon as he received
                    the intelligence, he ordered the earl of Surry to ſuppreſs the rebels; but he
                    declining the command of the army himſelf on account of his health, reſigned it
                    to his nephew, Lord Henry Percy. A great army, ſome ſay no fewer than 40,000
                    men, was now aſſembled, with which Percy marched againſt the Scots. He found
                    them encamped at Irwin, with a lake in their front, and their flanks ſecured by
                    entrenchments, ſo that they could not be attacked without the utmoſt danger. The
                    Scots, however, ruined every thing by their diſſenſions. Wallace was envied on
                    account of his accompliſhments, which had raiſed his reputation above the other
                    officers, whoſe birth and circumſtances were higher than his. His companions
                    accordingly became jealous, and began to ſuggeſt, that an oppoſition to the
                    Engliſh could only be productive of farther national deſtruction. Sir Richard
                    Lundin, an officer of great rank- formed a party againſt Wallace, and went over
                    to Edward with all his followers. He attempted to juſtify<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0754.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0748"/> his
                    treachery, by ſaying, “I will remain no longer of a party that is at variance
                    with itſelf;” without conſidering that he himſelf, and his party, were partly
                    the occaſion of that variance. Other leaders entered into a negociation with the
                    Engliſh. Bruce, the Steward and his brother Alexander de Lindeſay, and Sir
                    William Douglas, acknowledged their offences, and made ſubmiſſions to Edward for
                    themſelves and their adherents.</p>
                <p>This ſcandalous treaty ſeems to have been negociated by the biſhop of Glaſgow,
                    and their recantation is recorded in the following words. —Be it known to all
                    men: Whereas we, with the commons of our country, did riſe in arms againſt our
                    lord Edward, and againſt his peace, in his territories of Scotland and Galloway,
                    did burn, flay, and commit divers robberies; we therefore, in our own name, and
                    in the name of all our adherents, agree to make every reparation and atonement
                    that ſhall be required by our ſovereign lord; reſerving always what is contained
                    in a writing which we have procured from Sir Henry Percy and Sir Robert
                    Clifford, commanders of the Engliſh forces; at Irvine, 9th July 1297.” To this
                    inſtrument was ſubjoined, "Eſcrit a Sire Willaume;” the meaning of which lord
                    Hailes ſuppoſes to be, that the barons had notified to Sir William Wallace their
                    having made terms of accommodation for themſelves and their party.</p>
                <p>Edward accepted the ſubmiſſion of the Scottiſh barons who had been in arms, and
                    granted liberty to thoſe whom he had made priſoners in the courſe of the former
                    year, on condition that they ſhould ſerve him in his wars againſt France. The
                    inconſtancy of Bruce, however, was ſo great, that acknowledgments of ſubmiſſion
                    or oaths of fealty were not thought ſufficiently binding on him; for which
                    reaſon the biſhop of Glaſgow, the Steward, and Alexander de Lindeſay, became
                    ſureties for his loyalty and good behaviour, until he ſhould deliver his
                    daughter Marjory as an hoſtage.</p>
                <p>Wallace alone refuſed to be concerned in theſe ſhameful ſubmiſſions; and, with a
                    few reſolute followers, reſolved to ſubmit to every calamity rather than give up
                    the liberty of his country. The barons had undertaken to procure his ſubmiſſion
                    as well as their own; but finding that to be impoſſible, the biſhop of Glaſgow
                    and Sir William Douglas voluntarily ſurrendered themſelves priſoners to the
                    Engliſh. Edward, however, aſcribed this voluntary ſurrender, not to any
                    honourable motive, but to treachery. He aſſerted, that Wiſheart repaired to the
                    caſtle of Roxburgh under pretence of yielding himſelf up, but with the concealed
                    purpoſe of forming a conſpiracy in order to betray that caſtle to the Scots; and
                    in proof of this, Edward appealed to intercepted letters of Wiſheart. On the
                    other hand, Wallace, aſcribing the biſhop’s conduct to traiterous puſillanimity,
                    plundered his houſe, and carried off his family captives.</p>
                <p>Immediately after the defection of the barons at Irvine, Wallace with his band of
                    determined followers attacked the rear of the Engliſh army, and plundered their
                    baggage; but was obliged to retire, with the loſs of 1000 men. He then found
                    himſelf deſerted by almoſt all the men of eminence and property. His army,
                    however, increaſed conſiderably by the acceſſion of numbers of inferior rank,
                    and he again began to act on the oſſenſive. While he employed himſelf in
                    beſieging the caſtle of Dundee, he was informed that the Engliſh army approached
                    Stirling. Wallace, having charged the citizens of Dundee, under the pain of
                    death, to continue the blockade of the caſtle, haſtened with all his troops to
                    guard the important paſſage of the Forth; and encamped behind a riſing ground in
                    the neighbourhood of the abbey of Cambuſkenneth. Brian Fitz-Allan had been
                    appointed governor of Scotland by Edward; but Warenne, who waited the arrival of
                    his ſucceſſor, remained with the army. Imagining that Wallace might be induced
                    by fair means to lay down his arms, he diſpatched two friars to the Scottiſh
                    camp, with terms of capitulation. “Return,” ſaid "Wallace, “and tell your
                    matters, that we came not here to treat but to affert our right, and to ſet
                    Scotland free. Let them advance, they will find us prepared.” The Engliſh,
                    provoked at this anſwer, demanded impatiently to be led on to battle. Sir
                    Richard Lundin remonſtrated againſt the abſurdity of making a numerous army paſs
                    by a long narrow bridge in preſence of the enemy. He told them, that the Scots
                    would attack them before they could form on the plain to the north of the
                    bridge, and thus certainly defeat them: at the ſame time he offered to ſhow them
                    a ford, which having croſſed with 500 horſe, and a choſen detachment of
                    infantry, he propoſed to come round upon the rear of the enemy, and by this
                    diverſion facilitate the operations of the main body. But this propoſal being
                    rejected, the Engliſh army began to paſs over; which was no ſooner perceived by
                    Wallace, than he ruſhed down upon them, and broke them in a moment. Creſſingham
                    the treaſurer was killed, and many thouſands were ſlain on the field, or drowned
                    in their flight. The loſs of the Scots would have been inconſiderable, had it
                    not been for that of Sir Andrew Moray, the intimate friend and companion of
                    Wallace, who was mortally wounded in the engagement. The Scots are ſaid to have
                    treated the dead body of Creſſingham with the utmoſt indignity; to have ſlead
                    him, and cut his ſkin into pieces, which they divided among themſelves; while
                    others tell us, they uſed it for making girths, and ſaddles.</p>
                <p>The victory at Stirling was followed by the ſurrender of Dundee caſtle, and other
                    places of ſtrength in Scotland; at the fame time the Scots took poſſeſſion of
                    Berwick, which the Engliſh had evacuated. But as a famine now took place in
                    Scotland by the bad ſeaſons and miſeries of war, Wallace marched with his whole
                    army into England, that he might in ſome meaſure relieve the neceſſities of his
                    countrymen by plundering the enemy. This expedition laſted three weeks, during
                    which time the whole tract of country from Cocker- mouth and Carliſle to the
                    gates of Newcaſtle was laid waſte with all the fury of revenge and rapacity;
                    though Wallace endeavoured, as far as poſſible, to repreſs the licentiouſneſs of
                    his ſoldiers.</p>
                <p>In 1298, Wallace aſſumed the title of “Governor of Scotland, in name of king
                    John, and by conſent of the Scottiſh nation;” but in what manner this office was
                    obtained, is now in a great meaſure unknown. In a parliament which he convoked
                    at Perth, he was confirmed in his authority; and under this title he conferred
                    the conſtabulary of Dundee on Alexander ſurnamed <hi rend="italic"
                        >Skrimgeour</hi> and his heirs, on account of his faithful aid in bearing
                    the royal ſtandard of Scotland. This<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0755.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0749"/> grant is ſaid to have been made with the conſent
                    and approbation of the Scottiſh nobility, 29th March 1298. From this period,
                    however, we may date the very great jealouſy which took place between Wallace
                    and the nobles who pretended to be of his party. His elevation wounded their
                    pride; his great ſervices reproached their inactivity in the public cauſe; and
                    thus the counſels of Scotland were perplexed with diſtruſt and envy, when almoſt
                    its very exiſtence depended on unanimity.</p>
                <p>In June 1298, Edward, who had all this time been in Flanders, returned to
                    England, and ſummoned the Scottiſh barons, under pain of rebellion, to attend
                    him in parliament; and, on their diſobeying his ſummons, he advanced with his
                    army towards Scotland. His main force, commanded by himſelf, aſſembled at
                    Berwick; but a body of troops, under the earl of Pembroke, having landed in the
                    north of Fife, were defeated with great loſs by Wallace, on the 12th of June.
                    The same month Edward invaded Scotland by the way of the eaſtern borders. No
                    place reſiſted him except the caſtle of Dirleton. After a reſolute defence, it
                    ſurrendered to Anthony Beck, biſhop of Durham.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the Scots were aſſembling all their ſtrength in the interior part of
                    the country. Few barons of eminence repaired to the national ſtandard. They
                    whoſe names are recorded, were John Cornyn of Badenoch, the younger; Sir John
                    Stewart of Bonkill, brother to <hi rend="italic">The Steward;</hi> Sir John
                    Graham of Abercorn; and Macduff, the grand-uncle of the young earl of Fife. —
                    Robert Bruce again acceded to the Scottiſh party; and with his followers guarded
                    the important caſtle of Air, which kept the communication open with Galloway,
                    Argyleſhire, and the iſles.</p>
                <p>The aim of Edward was to penetrate into the weſt, and there to terminate the war.
                    He appointed a fleet, with proviſions, to proceed to the frith of Clyde, and
                    await his arrival in thole parts. This precaution was abſolutely neceſſary for
                    the ſubliſtence of his numerous army in a country impoveriſhed and waſte.</p>
                <p>Waiting for accounts of the arrival of his fleet, he eſtabliſhed his
                    head-quarters at Templeliſton, between Edinburgh and Linlithgow.</p>
                <p>A dangerous inſurrection aroſe in his camp. He had beſtowed a donative of wine
                    among his ſoldiers; they became intoxicated; a national quarrel enſued. — In
                    this tumult the Welſh ſlew 18 Engliſh eccleſiaſtics. The Englilh horſemen rode
                    in among the Welſh, and revenged this outrage with great ſlaughter. The Welſh in
                    diſguſt ſeparated themſelves from the army. It was reported to Edward, that they
                    had mutinied, and gone over to the Scots: “I care not,” ſaid Edward, diſſembling
                    the danger; “let my enemies go and join my enemies; I truſt that in one day I
                    ſhall chaſtiſe them all.”</p>
                <p>Edward was now placed in moſt critical circumſtances. As the fleet with
                    proviſions had been detained by contrary winds, he could not venture to advance,
                    neither could he ſubſiſt any longer in his preſent quarters. To retreat would
                    have ſullied the glory of his arms, and expoſed him to the obloquy and murmurs
                    of a discontented people. Yet he ſubmitted to this hard neceſſity. Abandoning
                    every proſpect of ambition and revenge, he commanded his army to return to the
                    eaſtern borders. At that moment intelligence arrived that the Scots were
                    advanced to Falkirk.</p>
                <p>Edward inſtantly marched againſt them. His army lay that night in the fields.
                    While Edward ſlept on the ground, his war-horſe ſtruck him and broke two of his
                    ribs. The alarm aroſe, that the king was wounded. They who knew not the cauſe,
                    repeated the cry, “The king is wounded; there is treaſon in the camp; the enemy
                    is upon us.” Edward mounted on horſeback, and by his preſence diſpelled the
                    panic. With a fortitude of ſpirit ſuperior to pain, he led on his troops. At
                    break of day, the Scottiſh army was deſcried, forming on a ſtony field at the
                    fide of a ſmall eminence in the neighbourhood of Falkirk.</p>
                <p>Wallace ranged his infantry in four bodies of a circular form. The archers,
                    commanded by Sir John Stewart, were placed in the intervals. The horſe,
                    amounting to no more than a thouſand, were at ſome diſtance in the rear. On the
                    front of the Scots lay a moraſs. Having drawn up his troops in this order,
                    Wallace pleaſantly ſaid, “Now I have brought you to the ring, dance according to
                    your ſkill.”</p>
                <p>Edward placed his chief confidence in the numerous and formidable body of
                    horſemen whom he had ſelected for the Scottiſh expedition. Theſe he ranged in
                    three lines. The firſt was led by Bigot Earl Marſhal, and the Earls of Hereford
                    and Lincoln; the ſecond by the biſhop of Durham, having under him Sir Ralph
                    Baſſet of Drayton; the third, intended for a reſerve, was led by the king
                    himſelf. No mention is made of the diſpoſition of his infantry: it is probable
                    that they were drawn up behind, to ſupport the cavalry, and to annoy the Scots
                    with their arrows and other miſſile weapons.</p>
                <p>Bigot, at the head of the firſt line, ruſhed on to the charge. He was checked by
                    the moraſs, which in his impetuoſity he had overlooked. This obliged him to
                    incline to the ſolid ground on his left, towards the right flank of the Scottiſh
                    army. The biſhop of Durham, who led the ſecond line, inclined to the right,
                    turned the moraſs, and advanced towards the left flank of the Scottiſh army. He
                    propoſed to halt till the reſerve ſhould advance. “To maſs, biſhop,” cried
                    Baffet, and inſtantly charged. The ſhock of the Engliſh cavalry on each ſide was
                    violent, and gallantly withſtood by the Scottiſh infantry; but the Scottiſh
                    cavalry, diſmayed at the number and force of the Engliſh men-at-arms,
                    immediately quitted the field. Stewart, while giving orders to his archers, was
                    thrown from his horſe and flain. His archers crowded round his body and periſhed
                    with him. Often did the Engliſh ſtrive to force the Scottiſh circle. “They could
                    not penetrate into that wood of ſpears,” as one of their hiſtorians ſpeaks. By
                    repeated charges, the outermolt ranks were brought to the ground. The Engliſh
                    infantry inceſſantly galled the Scots with ſhowers of ſtones and arrows. Macduff
                    and Sir John Graham fell. At length the Scots were broken by the numbers and
                    weight of the Engliſh cavalry, and the rout became univerſal.</p>
                <p>The number of the Scots ſlain in this battle muſt have been very great. As is

                            would be tedious and unprofitable to recite all that has been ſaid on
                            this ſubject by our own writers from Fordun to Abercrombie. How Wallace,
                            Stewart, and Cornyn, quarrelled on the punctilio of leading the van of
                            an army which ſtood on the defenſive: How Stewart compared Wallace to
                            ‘an owl with borrowed feathers,’: How the Scottiſh commanders, buſied in
                            this frivolous altercation, had no leiſure to form their army: How
                            Cornyn traiterouſly withdrew with 10,000 men: How Wallace, from
                            reſentment, followed his example: How by ſuch diſaſtrous incidents, the
                            Scottiſh army was enfeebled, and Stewart and his party abandoned to
                            deſtruction. Our hiſtories abound in traſh of this kind: There is
                            ſcarcely one of our writers who has not produced an invective againſt
                            Cornyn, or an apology for Wallace, or a lamentation over the deſerted
                            Stewart. What diſſenſions may have prevailed among the Scottiſh
                            commanders, it is impoſſible to know. It appears not to me that their
                            diſſenſions had any influence on their conduct in the day of battle. The
                            truth ſeems to be this: The Engliſh cavalry greatly exceeded the
                            Scottiſh in numbers, were infinitely better equipped and more adroit:
                            the Scottiſh cavalry were intimidated, and fled. Had they remained on
                            the field, they might have preſerved their honour; but they never could
                            have turned the chance of that day. It was natural, however, for ſuch of
                            the infantry as ſurvived the engagement, to impute their diſaſter to the
                            defection of the cavalry. National pride would aſcribe their flight to
                            treachery rather than to puſillanimity. It is not improbable that Cornyn
                            commanded the cavalry: hence a report may have been ſpread, that Cornyn
                            betrayed his country; this report has been embelliſhed by each
                            ſucceſſive relator. When men are ſeized with a panic, their commander
                                <hi rend="italic">must</hi> from neceſſity, or <hi rend="italic"
                                >will</hi> from prudence, accompany them in their flight. Earl
                            Warrenne fled with his army from Stirling to Berwick; yet Edward I. did
                            not puniſh him as a traitor or a coward.</p><p>“The tale of Cornyn’s
                            treachery, and Wallace’s ill-timed reſentment, may have gained credit,
                            becauſe it is a pretty tale, and not improbable in itſelf: but it amazes
                            me that the ſtory of the <hi rend="italic">congreſs</hi> of Bruce and
                            Wallace after the battle of Falkirk ſhould have gained credit. I lay
                            aſide the full evidence which we now poſſeſs, 'that Bruce was not, at
                            that time, of the Engliſh party, nor preſent at the battle.’ For it muſt
                            be admitted, that our hiſtorians knew nothing of thoſe circumſtances
                            which demonſtrate the impoſſibility of the co <hi rend="italic"
                                >ngreſs.</hi> But the wonder is, that men of ſound judgment ſhould
                            not have ſeen the abſurdity of a long converſation between the commander
                            of a flying army, and one of the leaders of a victorious army. When
                            Fordun told the ſtory, he placed a 'narrow but inacceſſible glen’
                            between the ſpeakers. Later hiſtorians have ſubſtituted the river Carron
                            in the place of the inacceſſible glen, and they make Bruce and Wallace
                            talk acroſs the river like two young declaimers from the pulpits in a
                            ſchool of rhetoric. ”</p></note> (E).</p>
                <p>The Scots in their retreat burnt the town and caſtle of Stirling. Edward repaired
                    the caſtle, and made it a place of arms. He then marched to the weſt. At his
                    approach, Bruce burnt the caſtle of Ayr, and retired. Edward would have purſued
                    him into Carrick; but the want of proviſions flopped his further progreſs. He
                    turned into Annandale, took Bruce’s caſtle of Lochmaben, and then departed out
                    of Scotland by the weſtern borders.</p>
                <p>Here may be remarked the fatal precipitancy of the Scots. If they had ſtudied to
                    protract the campaign, inſtead of hazarding a general action at Falkirk, they
                    would have foiled the whole power of Edward, and reduced him to the neceſſity of
                    an inglorious retreat,</p>
                <p>In 1299 Edward thought proper to releaſe John Baliol the unfortunate king of
                    Scotland, whom he had kept cloſe priſoner ever ſince the year 1296. Before this
                    time Baliol had uſed the moſt diſgraceful methods to recover his liberty. He had
                    ſolemnly declared, that “he would never have any intercourſe with the Scots;
                    that he had found them a falſe and treacherous people; and that he had reaſon to
                    ſuſpect them of an intention to poiſon him.” However, notwithſtanding all his
                    proteſtations, Edward ſtill detained him in captivity; but at laſt releaſed him
                    at the mediation of the pope, though after a ſingular form: He ordered the
                    governor of Dover to convey him to the French coaſt, and there to deliver him to
                    the papal nuncio, “with full power to the pope to diſpoſe of Baliol and his
                    Engliſh eſtate.” In conſequence of which he was conveyed to Witſand, delivered
                    to the nuncio in preſence of a notary and witneſſes, and a receipt taken for his
                    perſon. Notwithstanding this abject ſtate, however, the Scots continued to own
                    him for their king, and to aſſert their national independency. Tho’ the
                    misfortune at Falkirk had deprived them of a very conſiderable extent of
                    territory, they were ſtill in poſſeſſion of the whole country beyond the Forth,
                    as well as the county of Galloway. By general conſent William Lamberton biſhop
                    of St Andrew’s, Robert Bruce earl of Carrick, and John Cummin the younger, were
                    choſen guardians of Scotland in name of Baliol. Wallace at this time was reduced
                    to the condition of a private man; nor had he any longer the command of the
                    Scots armies, nor any ſhare in their councils. —The new guardians undertook to
                    reduce the caſtle of Stirling, and Edward prepared to defend it. The Scots
                    poſted themſelves at the Torwood, and choſe their ground judiciouſly, ſo that
                    Edward could ſcarce have raiſed the ſiege without diſlodging them; which finding
                    it impoſſible for him to do, he returned home in diſguſt. Next year he invaded
                    Scotland on the weſt fide, wafted Annandale, and reduced Galloway; but the Scots
                    being now taught by experience to avoid a general action, choſe their poſts with
                    ſuch ſkill, that Ed-<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0757.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0751"/> ward could not penetrate farther; and the ſame
                    year a truce was concluded with the Scots, to continue till Whitſunday 1301.</p>
                <p>This year a new competitor appeared for the crown of Scotland. Boniface VIII. in
                    a bull directed to Edward, averred, that Scotland belonged anciently, and did
                    ſtill belong, to the holy ſee; and ſupported his extravagant claim by ſome
                    ſtrange authorities; ſuch as, that Scotland had been miraculouſly converted by
                    the relics of St Andrew: after which he proceeded to ſhow the futility of
                    Edward’s pretenſions, and that Scotland never had any feudal dependence on
                    England. He required Edward to ſet at liberty all the Scottiſh eccleſiaſtics,
                    particularly Wiſheart biſhop of Glaſgow, and to remove his officers from the
                    patrimony of the church: “But (added he) ſhould you have any pretenſions to the
                    whole, or any part of Scotland, ſend your proctors to me within ſix months; I
                    will hear and determine according to juſtice; I take the cauſe under my own
                    peculiar cognizance.”</p>
                <p>This interpoſition of the pope had probably been procured by Scottiſh emiſſaries
                    at the court of Rome; but, however ridiculous his pretenſions might be, they
                    afforded matter of very ſerious conſideration to Edward. After ſpending a whole
                    winter in deliberations, Edward and his parliament made ſeparate anſwers to the
                    pope. The anſwer of the parliament was to the following purpoſe: All England
                    knows, that ever ſince the firſt eſtabliſhment of this kingdom, our kings have
                    been liege- lords of Scotland. At no time has the kingdom of Scotland belonged
                    to the church. In temporals, the kings of England are not amenable to the ſee of
                    Rome. We have with one voice reſolved, that, as to temporals, the king of
                    England is independent of Rome; that he ſhall not ſuffer his independency to be
                    queſtioned; and therefore, that he ſhall not ſend commiſſioners to Rome. Such
                    is, and ſuch, we truſt in God, ever will be, our opinion. We do not, we cannot,
                    we muſt not, permit our king to follow meaſures ſubverſive of that government
                    which we have ſworn to maintain, and which we will maintain.”</p>
                <p>The king entered into a more full refutation of the pope’s arguments; and having,
                    as he thought, anſwered them ſufficiently, he marched again into Scotland: but,
                    by the mediation of France, another truce was concluded, to laſt till St
                    Andrew’s day 1302.</p>
                <p>After the expiration of the truce, Edward ſent an army into Scotland, under the
                    commandof John de Segrave. This general divided his troops into three bodies;
                    but, keeping them ſo far diſtant that they could not ſupport each other, they
                    were all engaged and defeated in one day by the Scots; near Roſlin (ſee ROSL <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">in).</hi> This, however, was the laſt ſucceſsful exploit of
                    the Scots at this periods The pope deſerted them; and the king of France,
                    concluded a peace with England, in which all mention of the Scots was
                    induſtriouſly avoided; ſo that they were left alone to bear the whole weight of
                    Edward’s reſentment, who now invaded their country in perſon with a mighty army.
                    He met with no reſiſtance in his progreſs, except from the caſtle of Brechin,
                    which was commanded by Thomas Maul, a brave and experienced officer. He held out
                    for 20 days againſt the whole power of the Engliſh army; but at laſt, being
                    mortally wounded, the place capitulated.</p>
                <p>From thence he proceeded northward, according to ſome hiſtorians, as far as
                    Caithneſs. He then returned towards the ſouth, and wintered in Dunfermline. In
                    that place there was an abbey of the Benedictine order; a building ſo ſpacious,
                    that, according to an Engliſh hiſtorian, three ſovereign princes with all their
                    retinue might have been lodged conveniently within its precincts. Here the
                    Scottiſh nobles ſometimes held their aſſemblies. The Engliſh ſoldiers utterly
                    demoliſhed this magnificent fabric.</p>
                <p>The only fortreſs that remained in the poſſeſſion of the Scots was the caſtle of
                    Stirling, where Sir William Oliphant commanded. To protect this ſingle place of
                    refuge, Cornyn aſſembled all his forces. He poſted his army on the ſouth bank of
                    the river, in the neighbourhood of Stirling, there to make the laſt ſtand for
                    the national liberty. The Scots fondly imagined, that Edward would attempt to
                    force the paſſage, as the impetuous Creſſingham had attempted in circumſtances
                    not diſſimilar. But the prudence of Edward fruſtrated their expectations. Having
                    diſcovered a ford at ſome diſtance, he croſſed the river at the head of his
                    wſhole cavalry. The Scots gave way, and diſperſed themſelves.</p>
                <p>All reſources but their own courage had long failed them; that laſt reſource
                    failed them; now, and they haſtened to conciliate the favour of the conqueror.
                    Previous to this, Bruce had ſurrendered himſelf to John de St John, the Engliſh
                    warden. Comyn and his followers now ſubmitted to Edward. They ſtipulated for
                    their lives, liberties, and eſtates: reſerving always to Edward the power of
                    inflicting pecuniary mulcts on them as he ſhould ſee fit.</p>
                <p>From the general conditions of this capitulation, the following perſons were
                    excepted: Wiſheart biſhop of Glaſgow, the Steward, Sir John Soulis, David de
                    Graham, Alexander de Lindeſay, Simon Fraſer, Thomas Bois, and Wallace. With
                    reſpect to them, it was provided, that the biſhop of Glaſgow, the Steward, and
                    Soulis, ſhould remain in exile for two years, and ſhould not paſs to the north
                    of Trent; that Graham and Lindeſay ſhould be baniſhed from Scotland for ſix
                    months; that Fraſer and Bois ſhould be baniſhed for three years from all the
                    dominions of Edward, and ſhould not be permitted, during that ſpace, to repair
                    to the territories of France. “As for William Wallace, it is agreed, that he
                    ſhall render himſelf up at the will and mercy of our ſovereign lord the king, if
                    it ſhall ſeem good to him.” Theſe were all the conditions that the Scottiſh
                    nation ſtipulated for the mam who had vanquiſhed the Engliſh at Stirling, who
                    had expelled them from Scotland, and who had once ſet his country free!</p>
                <p>Amid this wreck of the national liberties, Wallace ſcorned ſubmiſſion. He lived a
                    free man: a free man he reſolved to die. Fraſer, who had too oft complied with
                    the times, now caught the ſame heroic ſentiments. But their endeavours to rouſe
                    their countrymen were ſh vain. The ſeaſon of reſiſtance was paſt. Wallace
                    perceived that there remained no more hope; and ſought out a place of
                    concealment, where, eluding the vengeance of Edward, he might ſilently lament
                    over his fallen country.</p>
                <p>Edward aſſembled at St Andrew’s what is called a<pb

                    Wallace, Fraſer, and the garriſon of Stirling, were ſummoned to appear: They
                    appeared not, and ſentence of outlawry was pronounced againſt them.</p>
                <p>Edward now prepared to beſiege the caſtle of Stirling; and, foreſeeing that the
                    reduction of this place would be attended with conſiderable difficulty, he
                    ſtripped the abbey of St Andrew’s of the lead which covered it, in order to
                    employ the metal in bullets for his battering machines. Oliphant was ſolemnly
                    ſummoned to ſurrender; but in vain. Edward drew out all his artillery, and
                    battered the walls with ſtones of 200 pounds weight. The beſieged, however,
                    defended themſelves with obſtinacy, and killed a great number of the Engliſh but
                    at laſt they were obliged to ſurrender: and Edward, looking upon the conqueſt of
                    Scotland as now complete, ſet out for York, and from thence to Lincoln.</p>
                <p>Though Edward had thus met with all the ſucceſs he could deſire in his
                    expeditions againſt the Scots, he could not but perceive that his dominion over
                    them muſt be very precarious, as long as he held them in the ſubjection of a
                    conquered people. He reſolved therefore once more to renew his attempts for an
                    union of the two kingdoms. He began with taking into favour the biſhop of
                    Glaſgow, Robert Bruce, and John Mowbray, who, next to Bruce and the Cummings,
                    was amongſt the greateſt of the Scottiſh nobility. To them he recommended the
                    ſettling the affairs of their country, but in ſuch a manner as to leave it in
                    his power to effect the propoſed union with England. This ſcheme, however, was
                    by no means agreeable to Bruce; who had now no other competitor for the crown
                    but Cumming, who was in a great meaſure incapable of oppoſing his deſigns;
                    neither indeed could it ever be made agreeable to the bulk of the nation; and
                    therefore came to nothing at laſt. Scotland, however, was ſubdued. Its
                    inhabitants had renounced every idea of aſſerting their liberty, and only ſtrove
                    to make their court to the conqueror. Wallace alone remained an exception.
                    Edward, who had received into favour thoſe who had proved traitors over and over
                    again, ſhowed a mean revenge againſt the only man who diſcovered a ſteady and
                    honourable ſpirit, and whoſe friendſhip ſeemed worth the courting. Ralph de
                    Haliburton, a priſoner, offered his aſſiſtance for diſcovering Wallace; and for
                    this purpoſe he was granted a temporary liberty: but what he did in this very
                    diſhonourable employment is unknown. Certain it is that Wallace was diſcovered,
                    and betrayed into the hands of the Engliſh, by Sir John Menteith, as is commonly
                    ſuppoſed; who is alſo ſaid to have been the intimate friend of Wallace, though
                    without any juſt foundation. Be this as it will, however, this celebrated and
                    heroic patriot was arraigned at Weſtminſter as a traitor to Edward, and as
                    having burnt villages, ſtormed cailles, and ſlaughtered many ſubjects of
                    England. Wallace denied his ever having been a traitor, and indeed with truth;
                    for he had always been the avowed enemy of Edward, and had not at any time owned
                    allegiance to him. But whatever his defences might have been, they were of no
                    avail with a judge who had reſolved on his deſtruction. Wallace was condemned to
                    die a traitor’s death, and the ſentence was executed with the utmoſt rigour! In
                    his laſt moments he afferted that independency which a degenerate nation had
                    renounced. His head was placed on a pinacle at London, and his mangled limbs
                    were diſtributed over the kingdom.</p>
                <p>After the death of Wallace, Edward thought of nothing but ſettling the affairs of
                    Scotland as a conquered country; however, he took care to preſerve the ancient
                    forms as far as was conſiſtent with the dependent ſtate of the nation. It has
                    been ſaid, indeed, that Edward abrogated all the Scottiſh laws and cuſtoms, and
                    endeavoured to ſubſtitute the Engliſh in their ſtead; but this is denied by
                    others. Lord Hailes gives us at length the record with reſpect to theſe laws, in
                    the following words. “And, with reſpect to the laws and uſages of the government
                    of Scotland, it is ordained, that the <hi rend="italic">custom of the Scots and
                        the Brets</hi> ſhall for the future bc prohibited, and be no longer
                    practiſed. It is alſo ordained, that the king’s lieutenant ſhall forthwith
                    aſſemble the good people of Scotland: and that, at ſuch aſſembly, ſhall be read
                    over the ſtatutes made by David king of Scots, and alſo the additions and
                    amendments which have been made by other kings; and that the lieutenant, with
                    the aſſiſtance which he ſhall then have, as well of Engliſhmen as of Scots,
                    ſhall amend ſuch of theſe ſtatutes and uſages as are plainly againſt the laws of
                    God and reaſon, as they beſt may in ſo ſhort a ſpace, and in ſo far as they can
                    without conſulting the king; and as to matters which they cannot undertake to
                    correct of themſelves, that they be put in writing, and laid before the king by
                    the lieutenant, and any number of commiſſioners, with parliamentary powers, whom
                    the Scots ſhall think fit to chooſe. That they ſhall meet with commiſſioners
                    appointed by the king, and finally determine as to the premiſſes.”</p>
                <p>This is the record by which it is generally ſuppoſed that the law of Scotland was
                    abrogated. But Lord Hailes is of opinion, that <hi rend="italic">the uſage of
                        the Scots and Brets</hi> here mentioned was ſomething, different from the
                    common law of the land. “We know (ſays he), from our ſtatute-book, that the
                    people of Galloway had certain uſages peculiar to themſelves; <hi rend="italic"
                        >Stat. Alex.</hi> II. c. 2. One was that cauſes were tried among them
                    without juries [Quon <hi rend="italic">. Attach.</hi> c. 72. 73. placed in ſome
                    ancient MSS. among LL. David I. c. 15.], and this may probably have been the
                    uſage which Edward aboliſhed. The people of Galloway were ſometimes
                    diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi rend="italic">Scots:</hi> thus the <hi
                        rend="italic">wild Scot of Galloway</hi> is an expreſſion to be found in
                    ancient inſtruments, and is proverbial even in our own days. <hi rend="italic"
                        >The uſage of the Brets,</hi> I take to be what relates to the judge called
                        <hi rend="italic">brithibh,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">brehon;</hi> in
                    Ireland, <hi rend="italic">brehan;</hi> and conſequently, that the thing here
                    aboliſhed was the commutation of puniſhments by exacting a pecuniary mulct.”</p>
                <p>An indemnity was now granted to the Scots upon certain conditions. Various fines
                    were impoſed, from one to five years rent of the eſtates of the delinquents. One
                    year’s rent was to be paid by the clergy, excluding the biſhop of Glaſgow; two
                    by thoſe who were more early in their ſubmiſſions than Comyn; three by Cornyn
                    and his aſſociates, and by the biſhop of Glaſgow; four years rent was to be paid
                    by William de Baliol and John Wiſheart; and five by Ingelram de Umfraville,
                    becauſe they had ſtood out longer. Three years rent was alſo paid by the vaſſals
                    of Baliol, Wiſheart, and Umfraville. Theſe fines were to be paid in moieties.
                    The perſon taxed was to pay half his income annually: and thus Umfraville, taxed
                    in five years rent, was al-<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0759.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0753"/> lowed ten years to diſcharge the fine. This was
                    an expreſs reſervation to Edward of all the royal demeſnes which Baliol might
                    have alienated. There was alſo an exception for thoſe who were already in
                    cuſtody, and thoſe who had not yet ſubmitted.</p>
                <p>Thus, after a long and obſtinate conteſt, was Scotland wholly reduced under the
                    dominion of Edward. — Within <hi rend="italic">four months</hi> that ſyſtem was
                    overthrown, which the inceſſant labour of <hi rend="italic">fifteen years</hi>
                    had eltabliſhed by craft, diſſimulation, and violence, with a waſte of treaſure,
                    and the effuſion of much blood. The cauſes of this event are related as follows.
                    Derverguill of Galloway had a ſon, John Baliol, and a daughter named Marjory.
                    John Cornyn was the ſon of Marjory, and, ſetting Baliol aſide, was heir to the
                    pretenſions of Derverguill. He had for many years maintained the conteſt againſt
                    Edward; but at laſt laid down his arms, and ſwore fealty to the conqueror; and
                    as Baliol had repeatedly renounced all pretenſions to the crown of Scotland,
                    Cornyn might now be conſidered as the rightful heir. His rival in power and
                    pretenſions was Bruce carl of Carrick. This young nobleman’s grandfather, <hi
                        rend="italic">the competitor,</hi> had patiently acquieſced in the award of
                    Edward. His father, yielding to the times, had ſerved under the Engliſh banners.
                    But young Bruce had more ambition, and a more reſtleſs ſpirit. In his earlier
                    years he acted upon no regular plan. By turns the partiſan of Edward and the
                    vicegerent of Baliol, he ſeems to have forgotten or ſtifled his pretenſions to
                    the crown. But his character developed itſelf by degrees, and in maturer age
                    became firm and conſiſtent. According to the traditionary report, Bruce made the
                    following propoſal to Cornyn: “Support my title to the crown, and I will give
                    you my eſtate; or give me your eſtate, and I will ſupport yours. ” The
                    conditions were properly drawn out and ſigned by both parties; but Cornyn,
                    either through fear or treachery, revealed the whole to Edward. On this the king
                    ſhowed Bruce the letters of his accuſer, and queſtioned him very hard; but the
                    latter found means to pacify him by mild and judicious anſwers. Notwithſtanding
                    this, however, Edward ſtill ſuſpected him, though he diſſembled his ſentiments,
                    until he ſhould get the brothers of Bruce into his power, and then deſtroy all
                    the family at once. The king having drank freely one evening, informed ſome of
                    his lords that he had reſolved to put Bruce to death next day. The earl of
                    Glouceſter, hearing this reſolution, ſent a meſſenger to Bruce, with twelve
                    pence and a pair of ſpurs, as if he had meant to reſtore what he had borrowed.
                    Bruce underſtood the meaning of his meſſage, and prepared for flight. The ground
                    was covered with ſnow, which would have diſcovered his flight; but, it is ſaid,
                    that Bruce ordered his farrier to invert the ſhoes of his horſes, and
                    immediately ſet out for Scotland in company with his ſecretary and groom. In his
                    way he obſerved a foot-paſſenger whoſe behaviour ſeemed to be ſuſpicious, and
                    whom he ſoon diſcovered to be the bearer of letters from Cornyn to the Engliſh
                    monarch, urging the death or immediate impriſonment of Bruce. The latter, filled
                    with reſentment, immediately beheaded the meſſenger, and ſet forward to his
                    caſtle of Lochmaben, where he arrived the ſeventh day after his departure from
                    London. Soon after this he repaired to Dumfries, where Cornyn happened at that
                    time to reſide. Bruce requeſted an interview with him</p>
                <p>in the convent of the Minorites, where he reproached him with his treachery.
                    Comyn gave him the lie, and Bruce inſtantly ſtabbed him; after which he haſtened
                    out of the convent, and called “To horſe.” His attendants, Lindeſay and
                    Kirkpatrick, perceiving him pale, and in extreme agitation, inquired how it was
                    with him? “Ill (replied Bruce); I doubt I have ſlain Cornyn.” “You doubt!” cried
                    Kirkpatrick; on ſaying which, he ruſhed into the place where Cornyn lay, and
                    inſtantly diſpatched him. Sir Robert Cornyn, a relation, attempted to defend his
                    kinſman, and ſhared his fate. Bruce had now gone ſo far, that it was in vain to
                    think of retracting; and therefore ſet himſelf in oppoſition to Edward in good
                    earneſt. The juſticiaries were then holding their court at Dumfries; who hearing
                    what had happened, imagined their own lives to be in danger, and barricaded the
                    doors. Bruce ordered the houſe to be ſet on fire: upon which they ſurrendered;
                    and Bruce granted them leave to depart out of Scotland without moleſtation.</p>
                <p>The above account of this cataſtrophe is taken from the Scots hiſtorians; thoſe
                    of England differ in many particulars. Lord Hailes ſuppoſes both to be wrong,
                    and that the true circumſtances of the quarrel are unknown. “My opinion (ſays
                    he) is, that Bruce, when he met Cornyn at Dumfries, had no intention of embruing
                    his hands in his blood, nor any immediate purpoſe of aſſerting his right to the
                    crown of Scotland; that the ſlaughter of Cornyn was occaſioned by a haſty
                    quarrel between two proud-ſpirited rivals; and that Bruce, from neceſſity and
                    deſpair, did then aſſert his pretenſions to the crown.”</p>
                <p>The death of Cornyn affected the Scots variouſly, according to their different
                    views and intereſts. The relations of the deceaſkd viewed it as a cruel
                    aſſaſſination, and joined with Edward in ſchemes of revenge. Some who wiſhed
                    well to the peace of their country, thought that it was better to ſubmit quietly
                    to the government of the Engliſh, than to attempt a revolution, which could not
                    be effected without much danger and blood- ſhed; but, on the other hand, the
                    friends of Bruce now ſaw the neceſſity they were under of proceeding to the
                    coronation of the new king without loſs of time. The ceremony was therefore
                    performed at Scone on the 25th of March 1306, in pretence of two earls, the
                    biſhops of St Andrew’s and Glaſgow, the abbot of Scone, John de Athol, and John
                    de Menteith. It had been cuſtomary, ſince the days of Macbeth, for one of the
                    family of Fife to put the crown on the king’s head; and Bruce found the
                    prepoſſeſſion of the Scots in favour of this circumſtance ſo ſtrong, that he was
                    obliged to ſeek for an expedient to ſatisfy them. Macduff the earl of Fife was
                    at that time in England, where he had married a near relation of Edward. His
                    lifter was wife to the earl of Buchan, one of the heads of the family of Cornyn,
                    and conſequently the determined enemy of Robert. By an uncommon effort of female
                    patriotiſm, ſhe poſtponed all private quarrels to the good of her country, and
                    in her huſband’s abſence repaired, with all his warlike accoutrements, to Bruce,
                    to whom ſhe delivered them up, and placed the crown upon his head. This crown is
                    ſaid to have been made by one Conyers an Engliſhman, who narrowly eſcaped being
                    puniſhed for it by Edward.</p>
                <p>The king of England received intelligence of all theſe<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0760.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0754"/> proceedings
                    with aſtoniſhmen; and without delay ſent a body of troops under the command of
                    Aymer de Valence earl of Pembroke, to ſuppreſs the rebellion. Bruce omitted
                    nothing for his defence. He had always been conſidered by his countrymen as a
                    promiſing accompliſhed young nobleman, but firmly attached to Edward’s perſon
                    and government; ſor which reaſon he had not been truſted by thoſe independent
                    patriots who joined Wallace. But their confidence was now gained by his
                    rendering himſelf ſo obnoxious to Edward, that no poſſibility of a
                    reconciliation was left; and he ſoon ſaw himſelf at the head of a ſmall army.
                    With theſe, who conſiſted of raw and unexperienced ſoldiers, Bruce formed a camp
                    at Methven near Perth, which laſt was the head-quarters of the enemy; but
                    knowing the diſadvantage under which he laboured from the inexperience of his
                    men, he reſolved to act upon the defenſive. The Engliſh general at laſt ſent
                    Bruce a challenge to fight him, which was accepted; but the day before the
                    battle was to have been fought by agreement, the Scots were attacked by
                    ſurpriſe, and totally defeated. Bruce behaved with the greateſt valour, and had
                    three horſes killed under him. Being known by the ſlaughter which he made, John
                    Mowbray, a man of great courage and reſolution, ruſhed upon him, and catching
                    hold of his horſe’s bridle, cried out, “I have hold of the new- made king!” but
                    he was delivered by Chriſtopher Seaton. Some Scottiſh hiſtorians have aſſerted,
                    that on this occaſion all the priſoners of note were put to death; but others
                    inform us, that though Edward did ſend orders to that purpoſe, the Engliſh
                    general pardoned all thoſe who were willing to ſwear fealty to his maſter:
                    however, it is certain, that after the battle of Methven, many priſoners were
                    hanged and quartered.</p>
                <p>This diſaſter almoſt gave the finiſhing ſtroke to the affairs of Bruce. He now
                    found himſelf deſerted by a great part of his army. The Engliſh had taken
                    priſoners great numbers of women whoſe huſhands followed Bruce; and all thoſe
                    were now ordered, on pain of death, to accompany their huſhands. Thus was Bruce
                    burdened with a number of uſeleſs mouths, and found it hard to ſubſiſt. The
                    conſequence was, that moſt of his men departed with their families, ſo that in a
                    few days his army dwindled down to 500 <hi rend="italic">.</hi> With theſe he
                    retreated to Aberdeen, where he was met by his brother Sir Neil, his wife, and a
                    number of other ladies, all of whom offered to follow his fortune through every
                    difficulty. But, however heroic this behaviour might be, it put Bruce to ſome
                    inconvenience, as he could ſcarce procure ſubſiſtence; and therefore he
                    perſuaded the ladies to retire to his caſtle of Kildrommey, under the protection
                    of Sir Neil Bruce and the Earl of Athol. In the mean time the deſertion among
                    Bruce’s troops continued, ſo that now he had with him no more than 200 men; and
                    as winter was coming on, he reſolved to go into Argyleſhire, where Sir Neil
                    Campbell's eſtate lay, who had gone before to prepare for his reception. In his
                    way thither he encountered incredible difficulties; and ſome of his followers
                    being cut off at a place called <hi rend="italic">Dalry,</hi> the reſt were ſo
                    diſheartened, that they all forſook him, excepting Sir Gilbert Hay, Sir James
                    (ſometimes called Lord) Douglas, and a few domeſtics. Bruce, however, kept up
                    the ſpirits of his little party by recounting to them the adventures of princes
                    and patriots in circumſtances ſimilar to his own. Having croſſed Lochlomond in a
                    ſmall crazy boat, he was discovered by his truſty friend the Earl of Lenox, who
                    had been proſcribed in England, and now lived in a kind of exile on his own
                    eſtate. The meeting between theſe friends was very affecting, and drew tears
                    from the eyes of all preſent. Lenox, who had heard nothing of Bruce’s
                    misfortunes, furniſhed him and his half-famiſhed attendants with plenty of
                    proviſions: but being ſoon made ſenſible that it was impoſſible for them to live
                    in a place where they were well known, and ſurrounded by enemies, Bruce reſolved
                    to ſeek out ſome more ſafe habitation. For this purpoſe Sir Neil Campbell had
                    already provided ſhipping; but our adventurers had ſcarcely ſet ſail, when they
                    were purſued by a large ſquadren of the enemy’s fleet. The bark which carried
                    the carl of Lenox eſcaped with the utmoſt difficulty to Cantire, where Bruce was
                    already landed: and, at their meeting, both agreed that their perſons ſhould
                    never afterwards be ſeparated while they remained alive.</p>
                <p>In the mean time Edward having compromiſed ſome differences with his Engliſh
                    ſubjects, reſumed his old project of entirely ſubduing Scotland; and his
                    intention now appears to have been to divide the lands of ſuch as he ſuſpected
                    of diſaffection among his Engliſh followers. He ordered a proclamation to be
                    made, that all who had any title to the honour of knighthood, either by heritage
                    or eſtate, ſhould repair to Weſtminſter to receive all military ornaments, their
                    horſes excepted, from his royal wardrobe. As the prince of Wales came under this
                    denomination, he was the firſt who underwent the ceremony; which gave him a
                    right to confer the like honour on the ſons of above 300 of the chief nobility
                    and gentry of England. The prince then repaired, at the head of this gallant
                    train, to Edward; who received them, ſurrounded by his nobility, in the moſt
                    ſolemn manner. The king then made a ſpeech on the treachery of the Scots, whoſe
                    entire deſtruction he vowed. He declared his reſolution of once more heading his
                    army in perſon; and he deſired, in caſe of his death, that his body might be
                    carried to Scotland, and not buried till ſignal vengeance was taken on the
                    perfidious nation. Having then ordered all preſent to join him within fifteen
                    days, with their attendants and military equipages, he prepared ſor his journey
                    into Scotland. He entered the country ſoon after Bruce’s defeat at Methven. The
                    army was divided into two bodies; one commanded by the king himſelf, the other
                    by the prince of Wales, and, under him, by the earls of Lancaſter and Hereford,
                    with orders to proceed northwards, and penetrate into the countries where the
                    intereſt of Bruce was ſtrongeſt. As he paſſed along, Edward cauſed all that fell
                    into his hands, whom be ſuſpected of favouring Bruce’s party, to be immediately
                    executed. The biſhop of Glaſgow was the only exception to this barbarity; he was
                    taken, but had his life ſpared on account of his function.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, as the prince of Wales continued his march northwards, Bruce’s
                    queen began to be alarmed for her own ſafety. She was adviſed to take ſanctuary
                    at the ſhrine of St Duthac in Roſsſhire; but there ſhe was made priſoner by
                    William earl of Roſs, who was of the Engliſh party. By Edward’s order ſhe was
                    ſent to London; her daughter, who was taken at the ſame time, being ſhut up in a
                    religious houſe. The<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0761.tif"

                    Bruſtewick; to have a waiting-woman and a maid-ſervant, advanced in life,
                    ſedate, and of good conversation; a butler, two men-ſervants, and a foot-boy for
                    her chamber, ſober, not riotous, to make her bed: three greyhounds when ſhe
                    inclines to hunt; veniſon, fiſh, and the faireſt houſe in the manor. In 1308,
                    ſhe was removed to another priſon; in 1312, ſhe was removed to Windſor caſtle,
                    20 ſhillings per week being allowed for her maintenance. In 1314, ſhe was
                    committed to Rocheſter caſtle, and was not ſet at liberty till the cloſe of that
                    year.</p>
                <p>The only fortreſs which Bruce poſſeſſed in Scotland was the caſtle of Kildrommey;
                    and it was ſoon beſieged by the earls of Lancaſter and Hereford. One Oſhurn
                    treacherouſly burnt the magazine; by which means the garriſon, deſtſtute of
                    proviſions, was obliged to ſurrender at diſcretion. The common ſoldiers were
                    hange; Sir Neil Bruce and the earl of Athol were ſent priſoners to Edward, who
                    cauſed them to be hanged on a gallows 50 feet high, and then beheaded and burnt.
                    The counteſs of Buchan, who had crowned King Robert, was taken priſoner; as was
                    Lady Mary Bruce, the king’s filter. Some hiſtorians ſay, that Edward ordered
                    theſe two ladies to be ſhut up in wooden cages, one to be hung over the walls of
                    the caſtle of Roxburgh, and the other over thoſe of Berwick, as public
                    ſpectacles: but Lord Hailes only tells us, that the counteſs of Buchan was put
                    into cloſe confinement in the caſtle of Berwick<note anchored="true" n="9"

                            Weſtminſter, p. 455. ſays, “Capitur etiam et illa impiiſſima conjuratrix
                            de Buchan, de qua conſultus Rex, ait, Quia gladio non percuſſit, gladio
                            non peribit; verum, propter illicitam conjurationem quam fecit, in

                            sempiternum.” Other Engliſh hiſtorians, copying M. Weſtminſter, have
                            ſaid the ſame thing. We cannot, therefore, blame Abercrombie for ſaying,
                            “She was put in a wooden cage ſhaped like a crown, and in that
                            tormenting poſture hung out from high walls or turrets to be gazed upon

                            Hemingford, Vol. I. p. 221. relates the ſtory in a manner ſomewhat
                            different. He ſays, that the earl of Buchan her huſhand fought to kill
                            her for her treaſon; but that Edward reſtrained him, and ordered her to
                            be confined in a wooden cage.</p><p>The intentions of Edward I. touching
                            the durance of the counteſs of Buchan, will be more certainly learned
                            from his own orders, than from the report of M. Weſtminſter. His orders
                            run thus: “By letters under the privy-ſeal, be it commanded, that the
                            chamberlain of Scotland, or his deputy at Berwick upon Tweed, do, in one

                            inconſiſtent with the ſtory related by M. Weſtminſter and other
                            hiſtorians. To thoſe who have no notion of any cage but one for a parrot
                            or a ſquirrel, hung out at a window, we deſpair of rendering this

                <p>About this time alſo many others of Bruce’s party were put to death; among whom
                    were Thomas and Alexander Bruce, two of the king’s brothers, and John Wallace,
                    brother to the celebrated Sir William. Bruce himſelf, in the mean time, was in
                    ſuch a deſpicable ſituation, that it was thought he never could give more
                    diſturbance; and it was even reported that he was dead. All his misfortunes,
                    however, could not intimidate him, or prevent his meditating a moſt ſevere
                    revenge upon the deſtroyers of his family. He firſt removed to the caſtle of
                    Dumbarton, where he was hoſpitably received and entertained by Angus lord of
                    Kintyre; but, ſuſpecting that he was not ſafe there, he failed in three days to
                    Rachrin, a ſmall iſland on the Iriſh coaſt, where he ſecured himſelf effectually
                    from the purſuit of his enemies. It was during his ſtay in this iſland, that the
                    report of his death was generally propagated. Notwithſtanding this, his party
                    increaſed conſiderably; and, even when he landed on this iſland, he was attended
                    by 300 men. However, after having lived for ſome time in this retreat, being
                    apprehenſive that the report of his death might be generally credited among his
                    friends in Scotland, it was reſolved to attempt the ſurpriſe of a fort held by
                    the Engliſh under Sir John Haſtings, on the iſle of Arran. This was performed
                    with ſucceſs by his two friends Douglas and Sir Robert Boyd, who put the
                    greateſt part of the garriſon to the ſword. The king, hearing of their ſuccefs,
                    paſſed over into Arran; but, not knowing where his people reſided, is ſaid to
                    have found them out by blowing a horn. He then ſent a truſty ſervant, one
                    Cuthbert, into his own country of Carrick; with orders, in caſe he found it well
                        affected<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0762.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0756"/>
                    to his caſtle, to light a fire on a certain point near his caſtle of Tunberry,
                    whence it could be diſcerned in Arran. Bruce and his party perceived the ſignal,
                    as they thought, and immediately put to ſea. Their voyage took up but little
                    time; and as Bruce had now 400 men along with him, he reſolved immediately to
                    act on the offenſive. His firſt exploit was to ſurpriſe his own caſtle of
                    Tunberry, which had been given, along with Bruce’s eſtate, to lord Henry Percy.
                    Him he drove out, along with the Engliſh garriſon; but, in the mean time, he met
                    with his fervant Cuthbert, who gave him diſagreeable intelligence. This man had
                    met with very little encouragement on his landing in Scotland; in conſequence of
                    which he had not lighted the fire agreed upon as a ſignal of his ſucceſs, that
                    which Bruce had obſerved having been kindled by accident. He alſo told him, that
                    the Engliſh were in full poſſeſſion of the country, and adviſed his maſter to be
                    upon his guard. Soon after this the king was joined by a lady of fortune, who
                    brought along with her 40 warriors. By her he was firſt particularly informed of
                    the miſerable fate of his family and relations; which, inſtead of diſheartening,
                    animated him the more with a deſire of revenge. However, he did not immediately
                    attempt any thing himſelf, but allowed Douglas to attempt the recovery of his
                    eſtate of Douglasdale, as Bruce himſelf had recovered his in Carrick. In this
                    expedition Douglas was joined by one Thomas Dickſon, a man of conſiderable
                    fortune, and who gave him intelligence concerning the ſtate of the country. By
                    his advice he kept himſelf private till Palm Sunday; when he and his followers
                    with covered armour repaired to St Bride’s church, where the Engliſh were
                    performing divine ſervice. The latter were ſurpriſed, but made a brave defence;
                    though, being overpowered by numbers, they were at laſt obliged to yield.
                    Douglas, without farther reſiſtance, took poſſeſſion of his own caſtle, which he
                    found well furniſhed with arms, proviſions, and money. He deſtroyed all that he
                    could not carry with him, and alſo the caſtle itſelf, where he knew that he muſt
                    have been beſieged if he had kept it.</p>
                <p>While Bruce and his friends were thus ſignalizing themſelves, and ſtruggling with
                    the Engliſh under ſo many diſadvantages, it is natural to think that they muſt
                    have met with many dangerous and difficult adventures. Many of theſe, indeed,
                    are related by the Scots hiſtorians; but moſt of them have the appearance of
                    fables, and it is now impoſſible to diſtinguiſh the true from the falſe; for
                    which reaſon we ſhall paſs them all over in ſilence, confining ourſelves only to
                    thoſe facts which are at once important and well authenticated.</p>
                <p>In 1307, the earl of Pembroke advanced into the weft of Scotland to encounter
                    Bruce. The latter did not decline the combat; and Pembrokc was defeated. Three
                    days after this, Bruce defeated with great Daughter another Engliſh general
                    named Ralph de Monthermer, and obliged him to fly to the caſtle of Air. The king
                    laid ſiege to the caſtle for ſome time, but retired at the approach of ſuccours
                    from England. This year the Engliſh performed nothing, except burning the
                    monaſtery at Paiſley. Edward, however, reſolved ſtill to execute his utmoſt
                    vengeance on the Scots, though he had long been retarded in his operations by a
                    tedious and dangerous indiſpoſition. But now, ſuppoſing that his malady was
                    decreaſed ſo far that he could ſafely proceed on his march, he offered up the
                    horselitter, in which he had hitherto been carried, in the cathedral church of
                    Carliſle; and, mounting himſelf on horſeback, proceeded on the way towards
                    Solway. He was ſo weak, however, that he could advance no farther than ſix miles
                    in four days; after which he expired in light of Scotland, which he had ſo often
                    devoted to deſtruction. With his dying breath he gave orders that his body
                    ſhould accompany his army into Scotland, and remain unburied until the country
                    was totally ſubdued; but his ſon, diſregarding this order, cauſed it to be
                    depoſited in Weſtminſter abbey.</p>
                <p>The death of ſuch an inveterate enemy to the Scottiſh name, could not fail of
                    raiſing the ſpirits of Bruce and his party; and the inactive and timid behaviour
                    of his ſon Edward II. contributed not a little to give them freſh courage. After
                    having granted the guardianſhip of Scotland to his favourite Piers de Gaveſton
                    earl of Pembroke, whom his lather had lately baniſhed, he advanced to Cumnock,
                    on the frontiers ol Airlhire, and then retreated into England; conferring the
                    office of guardian of Scotland upon John de Bretagne earl of Richmond, a
                    fortnight after he had beſtowed it on Gaveſton. He was no ſooner gone than Bruce
                    invaded Galloway. The inhabitants refuſing to follow his ſtandard, he laid waſte
                    the country; but was defeated, and obliged to retire northwards by the guardian.
                    In the north he over-ran the country without oppoſition; and ſoon began to move
                    ſouthwards again in order to repair his late diſgrace. He was encountered by
                    Cornyn earl of Buchan with an undiſciplined body of Engliſh, whom he entirely
                    defeated and diſperſed. But about this time he was ſeized with a grievous
                    diſtemper, which weakened him so much, that no hopes were left of his recovery.
                    In this enfeebled ſituation, he was attacked by the earl of Buchan and John
                    Mowbray an Engliſh commander, who had aſſembled a body of troops in order to
                    efface their late difhonout. The armies met at Inverury in Aberdeenſhire. Bruce
                    was too weak to ſupport himſelf, and therefore was held upon horſeback by two
                    attendants: but he had the pleaſure of ſeeing his enemies totally defeated, and
                    purſued with great ſlaughter for many mile; and it is reported, that the
                    agitation of his ſpirits on that day proved the means of curing him of his
                    diſeaſe. This battle was fought on the 22d of May 1308.</p>
                <p>The king of Scotland now took revenge of his enemies, after the manner of that
                    barbarous age, by waſting the country of Buchan with fire and ſword. His
                    ſucceſſes had ſo raiſed his character, that many of the Scots who had hitherto
                    adhered to the Engliſh cauſe, now came over to that of Robert. Edward, the
                    king’s brother, invaded Galloway, and defeated the inhabitants of that country.
                    John de St John, an Engliſh commander, with 1500 horſemen, attempted to ſurpriſe
                    him; but Edward having received timely information of his deſigns, ordered the
                    infantry and meaner part of his army to entrench themſelves ſtrongly, while he
                    himſelf, with no more than 50 horſemen, well armed, under cover of a thick miſt,
                    attacked his enemies, and put them to flight. After this he reduced all the
                    fortreſſes in the country, and totally expelled the Engliſh from it. About this
                    time alſo, Douglas, when roving about the moun-<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0763.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0757"/> tainous parts
                    of Tweedale, ſurprised and made priſoners Thomas Randolph the king’s nephew, and
                    Alexander Stewart of Bonkhill, who had hitherto continued inimical to the
                    intereſts of Robert. Randolph was conducted to the king, but talked to him in an
                    haughty ſtrain; upon which his uncle put him into cloſe confinement.</p>
                <p>The next exploit of Robert was againſt the lord of Lorn, a diviſion of
                    Argyleſhire. It was this nobleman who had reduced the king to ſuch ſtraits after
                    his defeat at Methven; and he now reſolved to take ample revenge. Having entered
                    the country, the king arrived at a narrow paſs, where the troops of Lorn lay in
                    ambuſh. This paſs had a high mountain on the one ſide, and a precipice waſhed by
                    the ſea on the other; but Robert having ordered Douglas to make a circuit and
                    gain the ſummit of the mountain with part of the army, he entered himſelf with
                    the reſt. He was immediately attacked; but Douglas with his men ruſhed down the
                    hill, and decided the victory in favour of the king; who ſoon after took the
                    caſtle of Dunſtaffnage, the chief reſidence of this nobleman.</p>
                <p>While Robert and his aſſociates were thus gaining the admiration of their
                    countrymen by the exploits which they daily performed, the Engliſh were ſo
                    unſettled and fluctuating in their counſels, that their party knew not how to
                    act. Edward ſtill imagined that there was a poſſibility of reconciling the Scots
                    to his government: and for this purpoſe he employed William de Lambyrton, biſhop
                    of St Andrew’s, who, after having been taken priſoner, and carried from one
                    place of confinement to another, had at laſt made ſuch ſubmiſſions, as procured
                    firſt his liberty, and then the confidence of Edward. This eccleſiaſtic having
                    taken a moſt ſolemn oath of fidelity to Edward, now reſolved to ingratiate
                    himſelf, by publiſhing againſt Robert and his adherents a ſentence of
                    excommunication, which had been reſolved on long before. This, however, produced
                    no effect; and the event was, that in 1309, through the mediation of the king of
                    France, Edward conſented to a truce with the Scots. This pacific diſpoſition,
                    however, laſted not long. The truce was ſcarcely concluded, when Edward charged
                    the Scots with violating it, and ſummoned his barons to meet him in arms at
                    Newcaſtle: yet, probably being doubtful of the event of the war, he empowered
                    Robert de Umfraville, and three others, to conclude a new truce; declaring,
                    however, that he did this at the requeſt of Philip king of Fiance, as his
                    deareſt father and friend, but who was in no ſort to be conſidered as the ally
                    of Scotland.</p>
                <p>The new negotiations were ſoon interrupted. They were again renewed; and in the
                    beginning of the year 1310 the truce was concluded, but entirely diſregarded by
                    the Scots. The progreſs of Bruce now became very alarming. The town of Perth, a
                    place at that time of great importance, was threatened; and to relieve it,
                    Edward ordered a fleet to ſail up the river Tay: he alſo commanded the earl of
                    Ulster to aſſemble a body of troops at Dublin, and from thence to invade
                    Scotland; his own barons were ordered to meet him in arms at Berwick. About the
                    end of September, he entered Scotland; paſſed from Roxburgh, through the foreſt
                    of Selkirk, to Biggar; from thence he penetrated into Renfrew; and turning back
                    by the way of Linlithgow, he retreated to Berwick, where he continued inactive
                    for eight months.</p>
                <p>During this invaſion, Robert had carefully avoided a battle with the Engliſh;
                    well knowing, that an invaſion undertaken in autumn would ruin the heavy armed
                    cavalry, on which the Engliſh placed their chief dependence. His cauſe was alſo
                    favoured by a ſcarcſty which prevailed at this time in Scotland; for as
                    magazines and other reſources of modern war were then unknown, the Engliſh army
                    were greatly retarded in their operations, and found it impoſſible to ſubliſt in
                    the country.</p>
                <p>The ſpirit of enterpriſe had now communicated itſelf to all ranks of people in
                    Scotland. In 1311, the caſtle of Linlithgow was ſurpriſed by a poor peaſant,
                    named <hi rend="italic">William Binnock.</hi> The Engliſh garriſon were ſecure,
                    and kept but a ſlight guard; of which Binnock being informed, concealed eight
                    reſolute men in a load of hay, which he had been employed to drive into the
                    caſtle. With theſe, as ſoon as the gate was opened, he fell upon the feeble
                    guard, and became maſter of the place; which was diſmantled by Robert, as well
                    as all the other caſtles taken in the courſe of the war.</p>
                <p>Edward now reſolved to invade Scotland again; and for this purpoſe ordered his
                    army to aſſemble at Roxburgh. But Robert, not contented with defending his own
                    country, reſolved in his turn to invade England. He accordingly entered that
                    country, and cruelly ravaged the biſhopric of Durham. He returned loaded with
                    ſpoil, and laid ſiege to Perth. After remaining ſix weeks before that place, he
                    raiſed the ſiege, but returned in a few days; and having provided ſcaling
                    ladders, approached the works with a choſen body of infantry. In a dark night he
                    made the attack; and having waded through the ditch though the water ſtood to
                    his throat, he was the ſecond man who reached the top of the walls. The town was
                    then ſoon taken; after which it was plundered and burnt, and the fortifications
                    levelled with the ground. This happened on the 8th of January 1312.</p>
                <p>Edward was now become averſe to the war, and renewed his negociations for a
                    truce; but they ſtill came to nothing. Robert again invaded England; burnt great
                    part of the city of Durham; and even threatened to beſiege Berwick, where the
                    king of England had, for the time, fixed his reſidence. He next reduced the
                    caſtles of Butel, Dumfries, and Dalſwinton, with many other fortreſſes. The
                    caſtle of Roxburgh, a place of the utmoſt importance, next fell into his hands.
                    The walls were ſcaled while the garriſon was revelling on the eve of Lent. They
                    retreated into the inner tower; but their governor, a Frenchman, having received
                    a mortal wound, they capitulated.</p>
                <p>Randolph, the king’s nephew, who had been impriſoned, as we have already
                    obſerved, was now received into favour, and began to diſtinguiſh himſelf in the
                    cauſe of his country. He blockaded the caſtle of Edinburgh ſo cloſely, that all
                    communication with the neighbouring country was cut off. The place was commanded
                    by one Leland, a knight of Gaſcony; but the garriſon ſuſpecting his fidelity,
                    impriſoned him in a dungeon, and choſe another commander in his ſtead. One
                    William Frank preſented himſelf to Randolph, and informed him how the walls
                    might be ſcaled. This man in his youth had reſided in the caſtle; and having<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0764.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0758"/> an intrigue
                    with a woman in the neighbourhood, had been accuſtomed to deſcend the wall,
                    during the night, by means of a ladder of ropes; whence, by a ſteep and
                    difficult path, he arrived at the foot of the rock. Randolph himſelf, with 30
                    men, undertook to ſcale the caſtle walls at midnight. Frank was their guide, who
                    ſtill retained a perfect memory of the path, and who firſt aſcended the wall.
                    But before the whole party could reach the fummit, an alarm was given, the
                    garriſon ran to arms, and a deſperate combat enſued. The Engliſh fought
                    valiantly till their commander was killed; after which they threw down their
                    arms. Leland, the former governor, was releaſed from his confinement, and
                    entered into the Scottiſh ſervice.</p>
                <p>In 1313, king Robert found the number of his friends increaſing with his
                    ſucceſſes. He was now joined by the earl of Athol, who had lately obtained a
                    grant of lands from Edward. This year, through the mediation of France, the
                    conferences for a truce were renewed. Theſe, however, did not retard the
                    military operations of the Scots. Cumberland was invaded and</p>
                <p>laid waſte: the miſerable inhabitants beſought Edward’s protection; who commended
                    their fidelity, and deſired them to defend themſelves. In the mean time, Robert,
                    leaving Cumberland, paſſed over into the iſle of Man, which he totally reduced.
                    Edward found great difficulties in raiſing the ſupplies neceſſary for carrying
                    on the war; but at laſt overcame all theſe, and, by the beginning of the year
                    1314, was prepared to invade Scotland with a mighty army. In March he ordered
                    his ſhip's to be aſſembled for the invaſion; invited to his aſſiſtance Eth
                    O‘Connor, chief of the Iriſh of Connaught, and 26 other Iriſh chiefs; ſummoned
                    them and his ſubjects in Ireland to attend his ſtandard, and gave the command of
                    theſe auxiliaries to the earl of Ulſter. His barons were ſummoned to meet him at
                    Berwick on the 11th of June; and 22,000 foot-ſoldiers, from the different
                    counties of England and Wales, were required by proclamation to aſſemble at
                    Wark.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the ſucceſſes of the Scots continued. Edward Bruce had reduced
                    the cattles of Rutherglen and Dundee, and laid ſiege to the caſtle of Stirling.
                    The governor of the place agreed to ſurrender, if he was not relieved before the
                    24th of June 1314; and to this Edward agreed, without conſulting his brother.
                    The king was highly diſpleaſed with this raſh treaty, which interrupted his own
                    operations, allowed the Engliſh time to aſſemble their utmoſt force, and at laſt
                    obliged him either to raiſe the ſiege or to put all on the event of a ſingle
                    battle. However, he reſolved to abide by the agreement, and to meet the Engliſh
                    by the appointed day. Having appointed a general rendezvous of his forces
                    between Falkirk and Stirling, he found their number to amount to ſomewhat more
                    than 30,000, beſides upwards of 15,000 of an undiſciplined rabble that followed
                    the camp. He determined to wait the Engliſh in a field which had the brook or
                        <hi rend="italic">burn</hi> of Bannock on the right, and Stirling on the
                    left. His chief dread was the ſtrength and number of the Engliſh cavalry, and
                    theſe he took every method to oppoſe. The banks of the brook were ſteep in many
                    places, and the ground between it and Stirling was partly covered with wood. The
                    king commanded many pits, of about a foot in breadth and two or three feet deep,
                    to be dug in all places where cavalry could have acceſs. From the deſcription
                    given of them by the hiſtorians of thoſe times, there ſeem to have been many
                    rows of them, with narrow intervals. They were carefully covered with bruſhwood
                    and ſod, ſo that they would eaſily be overlooked by a raſh and impetuous enemy.
                    It is ſaid by ſome authors, that he alſo made uſe of caltrops, to annoy the
                    horſes in the moil effectual manner.</p>
                <p>On the 23d of June, the "Scots received intelligence of the approach of Edward,
                    and prepared to decide the fate of their country. The front of their army
                    extended from the brook called <hi rend="italic">Bannockburn</hi> to thc
                    neighbourhood of St Ninians, pretty nearly upon the line of the preſent
                    turnpike-road from Stirling to Kilſyth; and the ſtone in which the king is ſaid
                    to have fixed his ſtandard is ſtill to be ſeen. Robert commanded all his
                    ſoldiers to fight on foot. He gave the command of the centre to Douglas, and
                    Walter the young ſteward of Scotland; his brother Edward had the command of the
                    right wing, and Randolph of the left; the king himſelf taking charge of the
                    reſerve, which conſiſted of the men of Argyle, Carrick, and the iſlanders. In a

                    attendants on his army.</p>
                <p>Randolph was commanded to be vigilant in preventing the Engliſh from throwing
                    ſuccours into the caſtle of Stirling; but 800 horſemen, commanded by Sir Robert
                    Clifford, made a circuit by the low grounds to the eaſt, and approached the
                    caſtle. The king, perceiving their motions, chid Randolph for his inadvertency,
                    on which the latter halted to encounter that body. As he advanced, the Engliſh
                    wheeled to attack him. Randolph drew up his men in a circular form, holding out
                    their ſpears on every fide. At the firſt onſet Sir William Daynecourt, an
                    Engliſh commander of diſtinguiſhed valour, was killed; but Randolph, who had
                    only a ſmall party with him, was ſurrounded on all ſides, and in the utmoſt
                    danger. Douglas perceived his danger, and requeſted the king to let him go to
                    his aſſiſtahce. Robert at firſt refuſed, but afterwards conſented with
                    reluctance. Douglas ſet out without delay; but as he approached he ſaw the
                    Engliſh falling into diſorder; upon which he called to his men to ſtop, and not
                    diminiſh the glory of Randolph and his men by ſharing their victory.</p>
                <p>Robert was in the front of the line when the vanguard of the Engliſh appeared. He
                    was meanly dreſſed, with a crown above his helmet, and a battle ax in his hand.
                    Henry de Bohun, an Engliſh knight, armed cap-a-pee, rode forward to encounter
                    him. Robert did not decline the combat, and ſtruck his antagoniſt ſo violently
                    with his battle-ax, that he is ſaid to have cleft him down to the chin; after
                    which the Engliſh vanguard retreated in confuſion. The Scottiſh generals are
                    ſaid to have blamed their king for his raſhneſs in thus encountering Bohun; and
                    he himſelf, conſcious of the juſtice of their charge, only replied, “I have
                    broke my good battle-ax.”</p>
                <p>On Monday the 24th of June, the whole Engliſh army moved on to the attack. The
                    van, conſiſting of archers and lancemen, was commanded by Gilbert de Clare earl
                    of Glouceſter, nephew to the Engliſh king, and Humphry de Bohun conſtable of
                    England; but the ground was ſo narrow, that the reſt of the army had not<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0765.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0759"/> ſufficient
                    room to expand itſelf; ſo that it appeared to the Scots as conſiſting of one
                    great compact body. The main body was brought up by Edward in perſon, attended
                    by Aymer de Valence earl of Pembroke, and Sir Giles d’Argentine, two experienced
                    commanders. Maurice abbot of Inchaſſray, placing himſelf on an eminence,
                    celebratcd maſs in the fight of the Scottiſh army. He then paſſed along the
                    front, barefooted, with a crucifix in his hands, and in few words exhorted the
                    Scots to fight for their rights and liberty. The Scots fell down on their knees;
                    which being perceived by Edward, he cried out, “They yield! See, they implore
                    mercy” “They do,” anſwered Umfraville, one of his commanders, “they do implore
                    mercy, but not from us. On that field they will be victorious or die.”</p>
                <p>As both parties were violently exaſperated againſt each other, the engagement
                    began with great fury. The king of Scotland, perceiving that his troops were
                    grievouſly annoyed by the Engliſh archers, ordered Sir Robert Keith the
                    mariſchal, with a few armed horſemen, to make a circuit and attack the archers
                    in flank. This was inſtantly accompliſhed; and as the weapons of the archers
                    were uſeleſs in a cloſe encounter, they could make very little reſiſtance, at
                    the ſame time that their flight ſpread diſorder through the whole army.</p>
                <p>Robert now advanced with the reſerve: the whole Engliſh army was in the utmoſt
                    confuſion; for the defeat of the archers had decided the victory in favour of
                    the Scots. The young and gallant earl of Glouceſter attempted to rally the
                    fugitives, but was thrown from his horſe, and cut in pieces, which increaſed the
                    general confuſion. At this critical moment, the numerous attendants on the
                    Scottiſh camp, prompted by curioſity or the deſire of plunder, iſſued from their
                    retirement. The Engliſh miſtook them for a body of freſh troops coming to the
                    aſſiſtance of their enemies, and fled with precipitation on all ſides. Many
                    ſought refuge among the rocks in the neighbourhood of Stirling caſtle, and many
                    were drowned in the rivers. Pembroke and Sir Giles d’Argentine had never quitted
                    Edward during the action; but now, ſeeing the battle irretrievably loſt,
                    Pembroke conſtrained the king to quit the field. D’Argentine refuſed to fly. He
                    was a man of great valour, and had a high reputation in Scotland. According to
                    the vulgar opinion, the three moſt eminent worthies in that age were the emperor
                    Henry of Luxemburg, Robert Bruce, and Giles d’Argentine. He is laid to have
                    thrice encountered two Saracen warriors in Paleſtine, and to have killed them
                    both each time. His valour now availed him but little; for ruſhing into the
                    midſt of the Scots army, he was inſtantly cut in pieces. Douglas, with 60
                    horſemen, purſued Edward cloſe. At the Torwood he met Sir Lawrence Abernethy,
                    who was haſtening to the Engliſh rendezvous with twenty horſemen. The latter
                    ſoon abandoned the cauſe of the vanquiſhed, and joined Douglas in the purſuit of
                    Edward, who fled to Linlithgow. He had ſcarcely arrived there, when he was
                    alarmed by the approach of the Scots, and again obliged to fly. Douglas and
                    Abernethy followed him with ſuch aſſiduity, that (as Lord Hailes chooſes to
                    Latinize the expreſſion of an ancient hiſtorian) <hi rend="italic">ne vel
                        mingendi locus concederetur;</hi> but, notwithſtanding their utmoſt efforts,
                    Edward got ſafe to Dunbar, where he was received by the earl of March, who
                    protected him till he could be conveyed by ſea to England.</p>
                <p>Such was the deceiſive battle of Bannockburn, the greateſt defeat the Engliſh
                    ever ſuſtained from the Scots. On the ſide of the latter no perſons of note were
                    ſlain, excepting Sir William Vipont, and Sir Walter Roſs the favourite of Edward
                    Bruce; and ſo grievouſly was Edward afflicted by the death of this man, that he
                    exclaimed, "O that this day’s work were undone, ſo Roſs had not died!” On the
                    Engliſh side were ſlain 27 barons and bannerets, and 22 taken priſoners; of
                    knights there were killed 42, and 60 taken priſoners; of eſquires there fell
                    700; but the number of the common men who were killed or taken was never known
                    with any certainty. The Welſh who had ſerved in the Engliſh army were ſcattered
                    over the country, and cruelly butchered by the Scottiſh peaſants. The Engliſh,
                    who had taken refuge among the rocks in the neighbourhood of Stirling,
                    ſurrendered at diſcretion: the caſtle was ſurrendered, and the privy-ſeal of
                    England fell into the hands of the king of Scots. The ſpoils of the Engliſh camp
                    were immenſe, and enriched the conquerors, along with the ranſom of many noble
                    priſoners who fell into their hands. Robert ſhowed much generoſity in his
                    treatment of the priſoners who fell to his ſhare. He ſet at liberty Ralph de
                    Monthermer, and Sir Marmaduke Twerge, two officers of high rank, without ranſom;
                    and by humane and generous offices alleviated the misfortune of the reſt. The
                    dead bodies of the earl of Glouceſter and the lord Clifford were ſent to
                    England, that they might be interred with the uſual ſolemnity. There was one
                    Baſton, a Carmelite friar and poet, whom Edward is ſaid to have brought with him
                    in his train to be ſpectator of his achievements, and to record his triumphs.
                    Baſton was made priſoner, and obliged to celebrate the victory of Robert over
                    the Engliſh. This he did in wretched Latin rhymes; which, however, procured his
                    liberty. After the battle of Bannockburn, the earl of Hereford retreated to the
                    caſtle of Bothwell, where he was beſieged by Edward Bruce, and ſoon obliged to
                    ſurrender. He was exchanged for the wife, ſiſter, and daughter of the king, the
                    young earl of Marr, and the biſhop of Glaſgow.</p>
                <p>The terror of the Engliſh after the defeat at Bannockburn is almoſt incredible.
                    Walſingham aſſerts, that many of them revolted to the Scots, and aſſiſted them
                    in plundering their own country. “The Engliſh,” ſays he, “were ſo bereaved of
                    their wonted intrepidity, that an hundred of that nation would have fled from
                    two or three Scotſmen.” Edward. Bruce and Douglas entered England on the eaſteen
                    ſide, ravaged Northumberland, and laid the biſhopric of Durham under
                    contribution. From thence they proceeded to Richmond, laid Appleby and ſome
                    other towns in aſhes, and returned home loaded with plunder. Edward ſummoned a
                    parliament at York, in order to concert means for the public ſecurity; and
                    appointed the earl of Pembroke, formerly the guardian of Scotland, to be
                    guardian of the country between the Trent and the Tweed. Robert, however, ſent
                    ambaſſadors to treat of a peace; but the Scots were too much elated with their
                    good fortune to make conceſſions, and the Engliſh were not yet ſufficiently
                    humbled to yield to all their demands. The ravages of war were again renewed:
                    the Scots continued their incurſions into England, and levied contributions in
                    different places.</p>
                <p>In 1315, the Engliſh affairs ſeemed a little to revive.<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0766.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0760"/> The Scots,
                    indeed, plundered Durham and Hartlepool; but they were repulſed from Carliſle,
                    and failed in an attempt on Berwick. The Iriſh of Ulſter, oppreſſed by the
                    Engliſh government, implored the aſſiſtance of Robert, and offered to
                    acknowledge his brother Edward as their ſovereign; who accordingly landed at
                    Carrick-fergus on the 25th of May 1315·, with 6000 men. — This was an enterprize
                    evidently beyond the power of Scotland to accompliſh, and which could not but be
                    perceived by Robert. However, there were motives which induced him to conſent.
                    The offer of a crown, though ever ſo viſionary, inflamed the ambition of Edward
                    Bruce, whoſe impetuous valour made no account of difficulties, however great. It
                    might have been deemed ungenerous, and perhaps would not have been politic or
                    ſafe, to have rejected the propoſals of the Iriſh for the advancement of his
                    brother, to whom the king owed more than he could repay. Beſides, the invaſion
                    of Ireland ſeemed a proper expedient for dividing the Engliſh forces. The event
                    proved unfortunate. Edward, after performing and ſuffering more than could
                    almoſt have been expected from human nature, was at laſt defeated and killed by
                    the Engliſh, as is related under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Ireland,</hi>
                    n⁰ 42.</p>
                <p>The king himſelf had gone over into Ireland, in order to aſſiſt his brother in
                    attempting the ſubjection of that country; and during his abſence the Engliſh
                    had made ſeveral attempts to diſturb the tranquillity of Scotland. The earl of
                    Arundel invaded the foreſt of Jed- burgh with a numerous army; but being drawn
                    into an ambuſcade by Douglas, he was defeated with great loſs. Edmund de
                    Cailaud, a knight of Gaſcony and governor of Berwick, invaded and wafted
                    Teviotdale; but while he was returning home loaded with ſpoil, he was attacked,
                    defeated, and killed by Douglas. Soon after this, intelligence was conveyed to
                    Douglas that one Robert Neville had boaſted that he would encounter him whenever
                    he ſaw his banner diſplayed. Douglas did not long delay to give him an
                    opportunity. He advanced to the neighbourhood of Berwick, diſplayed his banner,
                    and burnt ſome villages. Neville, provoked at theſe ravages, took the field,
                    encountered Douglas, and was defeated and killed. By ſea the Engliſh invaded
                    Scotland, and anchored off Inverkeſthing in the frith of Forth, where they ſoon
                    after landed. Five hundred men, under the command of the earl of Fife and the
                    ſheriff of that country, attempted to oppoſe their landing, but were intimidated
                    by the number of their enemies. William Sinclair biſhop of Dunkeld happened to
                    meet the fugitives; and having by his reproaches obliged them to rally, he led
                    them on again to the charge, and drove the Engliſh to their ſhips with
                    conſiderable loſs. For this exploit Robert conferred the title of <hi
                        rend="italic">the king's biſhop</hi> on Sinclair; and he was long remembered
                    by his countrymen on this account.</p>
                <p>In 1317, after king Robert had returned from his Iriſh expedition, a bull was
                    iſſued by the pope (John XXII.) commanding a two years truce between England and
                    Scotland, under pain of excommunication. Two cardinals were diſpatched into
                    Britain to make known his commands; and they were privately empowered to inflict
                    the higheſt ſpiritual cenſures on Robert Bruce, or whomſoever elſe they thought
                    proper. About the beginning of September 1317, two meſſengers were ſent to
                    Robert by the cardinals, The king gave them</p>
                <p>a gracious reception 5 and after conſulting with his barons, returned for anſwer,
                    that he very much deſired a good and perpetual peace, either by the mediation of
                    the cardinals, or by any other means. He allowed the <hi rend="italic">open</hi>
                    letters from the pope, which recommended peace, to be read in his preſence, and
                    liſtened to them with due reſpect, But he would not receive the <hi
                        rend="italic">ſealed</hi> letters addreſſed to <hi rend="italic">Robert
                        Bruce governor of Scotland,</hi> alleging, that there might be many of his
                    barons whoſe names were <hi rend="italic">Robert Bruce,</hi> and that theſe
                    barons might probably have ſome ſhare in the government. Unleſs, therefore, the
                    letters were addreſſed to him as king <hi rend="italic">of Scotland,</hi> he
                    could not receive them without advice of his parliament, which he promiſed
                    immediately to aſſemble on the occaſion. The meſſengers attempted to apologiſe
                    for the omiſſion of the title of <hi rend="smallcaps">King. "</hi> The holy
                    church was not wont,” they ſaid, “during the dependence of a controverſy, to
                    write or fay any thing which might be interpreted as prejudicial to the claims
                    of either of the contending parties.” “Since then,” anſwered the king, “my
                    ſpiritual father and my holy mother would not <hi rend="italic">prejudice</hi>
                    the cauſe of my adverſary by bellowing on me the appellation of king during the
                    dependence of the controverſy, they ought not to have <hi rend="italic"
                        >prejudiced</hi> my cauſe by withdrawing that appellation from me. I am in
                    poſſeſſien of the kingdom of Scotland; all my people call me king; and foreign
                    princes addreſs me under that title; but it ſeems that rny parents are partial
                    to their Engliſh ſon. Had you preſumed to preſent letters with ſuch an addreſs
                    to any other ſovereign prince, you might perhaps have been anſwered in a harſher
                    ſtyle; but I reverence you as the meſſengers of the holy ſee. ”</p>
                <p>The meſſengers, quite abaſhed with this reply, changed the diſcourſe, and
                    requeſted the king that he would conſent to a temporary ceſſation of
                    hoſtilſties; but to this he declared, that he never would conſent, while the
                    Engliſh daily invaded and plundered his people. His counſellors, however,
                    informed the meſſengers, that if the letters had been addreſſed to the <hi
                        rend="italic">king of Scots,</hi> the negociations would inſtantly have been
                    opened. This diſreſpectful omiſſion they imputed to the intrigues oſ the Engliſh
                    at the court of Rome, hinting at the ſame time that they had received this
                    intelligence from Avignon.</p>
                <p>When the meſſengers had informed the cardinals of theſe proceedings, the latter
                    determined to proclaim the papal truce in Scotland; in which hazardous office
                    they employed Adam Newton, guardian of the monaſtery of Minorites, at Berwick,
                    who was charged with letters to the clergy of Scotland, particularly to the
                    biſhop of St Andrew’s. The monk found the king encamped with his army in a wood
                    near Old Cambus, making preparations for aſſaulting Berwick. Rerſonal acceſs was
                    denied to the king; but the monk, in obedience to his maſters, proclaimed the
                    truce by the authority of the pope. The king ſent him for anſwer, that he would
                    liſten to no bulls, till he was treated as king of Scotland, and had made
                    himſelf matter of Berwick.</p>
                <p>The poor monk, terrified at this anſwer, requeſted either a ſafe conduct to
                    Berwick, or permiſſion to paſs into Scotland, and deliver his letters to the
                    Scottiſh clergy. Both were refuſed; and he was commanded to leave the country
                    without loſs of time. He ſet out for Berwick; but in his way thither was
                    attacked by<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0767.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0761"/>
                    robbers, or ſome who pretended to be ſo. By them he was ſtripped and robbed of
                    all his parchments, together with his letters and inſtructions; the robbers
                    alſo, it is ſaid, tore the pope’s bull, without any regard to its ſanctity.</p>
                <p>In 1318, king Robert proceeded in his enterprise againſt Berwick, but reſolved to
                    employ artifice as well as force in the reduction of it. A citizen of Berwick,
                    by name <hi rend="italic">Spalding,</hi> having been ill uſed by the governor,
                    reſolved to revenge himſelf; and therefore wrote a letter to a certain Scottiſh
                    lord, whoſe relation he had married, offering on a certain night to betray the
                    poſt where he kept guard. The nobleman communicated this important intelligence
                    to the king, "You did well,” said Robert, “in making me your confident; for if
                    you had told this either to Randolph or Douglas, you would have offended the one
                    whom you did not truſt: Both of them, however, ſhall aid you in the execution of
                    the enterprise.” The king then commanded him to repair to a certain place with a
                    body of troops; to which place he alſo gave ſeparate orders to Douglas and
                    Randolph to repair at the ſame hour, each with a body of troops under his
                    command. The forces thus cautiouſly aſſembled marched to Berwick, and, aſſiſted
                    by Soalding, ſcaled the walls, making themſelves maſters of the town in a few
                    hours. The garriſon of the caſtle, perceiving that the number of Scots was but
                    ſmall, made a deſperate ſally with the men who had fled into the caſtle from the
                    town; but, after an obſtinate conflict, they were defeated and driven back,
                    chiefly by the extraordinary valour of a young knight named <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sir William Keith of Galston. —</hi> This happened on the 28th of March
                    1318.</p>
                <p>King Robert no ſooner heard of the ſucceſs of his forces againſt the town, than
                    he haſtened to lay ſiege to the caſtle of Berwick. This was ſoon obliged to
                    capitulate; after which the Scots entered Northumberland, and took the caſtles
                    of Wark, Harbottle, and Mitford. In May, they again invaded England, and
                    penetrated into Yorkſhire. In their progreſs they burnt the towns of
                    Northallerton, Boroughbridge, Scarborough, and Skipton in Craven, forcing the
                    inhabitants of Rippon to redeem themſelves by paying 1000 merks: after which
                    they returned to Scotland with much booty; and, as an Engliſh hiſtorian
                    expreſſes it, "driving their priſoners before them like flocks of ſheep.”</p>
                <p>This year the interpoſition of the pope was obtained againſt Robert, with a view
                    to intimidate the Scottiſh nation; and the two cardinals refilling in England
                    were commanded to excommunicate <hi rend="italic">Robert Bruce and his
                        adherents</hi>, on account oſ his treatment of the meſſengers of the holy
                    ſee, and his aſſault of Berwick, after a truce had been proclaimed by the papal
                    authority. — This ſentence was accordingly put in execution, though Robert had
                    certainly been excommunicated <hi rend="italic">once,</hi> if not oftener,
                    before. Meſſengers were ſent from Scotland to Rome, in order to procure a
                    reverſal of the ſentence; but Edward diſpatched the biſhop of Hereford, and Hugh
                    d'Eſpencer the Elder, to counteract this negociation, informing his holinefs at
                    the ſame time of certain intercepted letters which had been written from Avignon
                    to Scotland; upon which the pope ordered all the Scots reſiding at Avignon, and
                    all of that place who had correſponded with Scotland, to be taken into
                    cuſtody.</p>
                <p>The moſt remarkable tranſaction of this year, however, was the defeat and death
                    of Edward Bruce in Ireland; of which an account is given under the article
                    IRELAND. n⁰ 42. His body was quartered, and diſtributed for a public ſpectacle
                    over Ireland; and his head was preſented to Edward, by John lord Bermingham the
                    commander of the Engliſh army; in return for which ſervice, he was rewarded with
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">earl of Lowth.</hi></p>
                <p>In the mean time Edward, who had. ſummoned a parliament to meet at Lincoln, was
                    obliged to prorogue it on account of the Scottiſh invaſion, and to aſſemble an
                    army at York for the defence of his country. At Michaelmas it was determined, in
                    a parliament held at London, that every city and town in England ſhould furniſh
                    a certain proportion of men completely armed. Thus a conſiderable body of troops
                    was ſoon raiſed; but, when, they aſſembled at York, their party-animoſities and
                    mutual diſtrust roſe to ſuch an height, that it was found neceſſary to ſend them
                    back to their habitations.</p>
                <p>In 1319, Edward, having ſucceeded ſo well in his negociations with the court of
                    Rome, reſoived to make ſimilar attempts with other powers to the prejudice of
                    the Scottiſh nation. Accordingly he requeſted the count of Flanders to prohibit
                    the Scots from entering his country: but to this requeſt he received the
                    following remarkable reply: “Flanders is the common country of all men; I cannot
                    prohibit any merchants from trafficking thither, for ſuch prohibition would
                    prove the ruin of my people.” Finding himſelf baffled in this attempt, the
                    Engliſh monarch once more determined to have recourſe to war; and with this view
                    commanded his army to aſſemble at Newcaſtle upon Tyne, on the 24th of July 1319:
                    but before he proceeded, he requeſted the prayers, of the clergy for the ſucceſs
                    of his expedition; and, to render their prayers the more effectual, he at the
                    ſame time demanded from them a great ſum of money by way of loan.</p>
                <p>Every thing being now in readineſs, the Engliſh army approached Berwick, which
                    was commanded by Walter the Steward of Scotland. This nobleman had long
                    apprehended an attack from the Engliſh, and had taken every means of defence in
                    his. power. The enemy, however, confiding in their numbers, made a general
                    aſſault; but were repulſed on the 7th of September, after a long and obſtinate
                    conteſt. Their next attempt was on the ſide towards the river. At that time the
                    walls of Berwick were of an incosiderable height; and it was preposed to bring a
                    veſſel cloſe to them, from whence the troops might eater by a drawbridge let
                    down from the maſt. But the Scots annoyed, the aſſailants, so much, that they
                    could not bring this veſſel within the proper diſtance; and at the ebb of the
                    tide it grounded, and was burnt by the besieged. —The Engliſh had then recourſe
                    to a new-invented engine which they called a <hi rend="italic">sow,</hi> but for
                    what reaſon is unknown. In many particulars it resembled the <hi rend="italic"
                        >testudo arietaria</hi> of the ancients. It appears to have been a large
                    fabric compoſed of timber, and well-roofed, having ſtages within it, and in
                    height ſurpaſſing the wall of the town. It was moved upon wheels, and ſerved for
                    the double purpose of conducting the miners to the foot of the wall, and armed
                    men to the ſtorm. This machine was counteracted by one conſtructed by John<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0768.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0762"/> Crab, a
                    Flemliſh engineer in the Scots ſervice. This was a kind of moveable crane,
                    whereby great ſtones might be raiſed on high, and then let fall upon the enemy.
                    The Engliſh made a general aſſault on the quarter towards the ſea, as well as on
                    the land ſide; ſo that the garriſon, exhauſted by continual fatigue, could
                    ſcarce maintain their poſts. The great engine moved on to the walls; and, though
                    ſtones were inceſſantly diſcharged againſt it from the crane, their effect was
                    ſo ſmall, that all hope of preſerving Berwick was lost. At length a huge ſtone
                    ſtruck it with ſuch force, that the beams gave way, and the Scots pouring down
                    combuſtibles upon it, it was reduced to aſhes. The Engliſh, however, ſtill
                    continued the attack. The Steward, with a reſerve of 100 men, went from poſt to
                    poſt, relieving thoſe who were wounded or unfit for combat. One ſoldier of the
                    reſerve only remained with him when an alarm was given that the Engliſh had
                    burnt a barrier at the port called <hi rend="italic">St Mary's,</hi> poſſeſſed
                    themſelves of the draw-bridge, and fired the gate. The Steward haſtened thither,
                    called down the guard from the rampart, ordered the gate to be ſet open, and
                    ruſhed out upon the enemy. A deſperate combat enſued, and continued till the
                    cloſe of the day, when the Engliſh commanders withdrew their troops.</p>
                <p>Notwithſtanding this brave defence, it was evident that the town could not hold
                    out long without a ſpeedy relief; and Robert could not, with any probability of
                    fucceſs, attack the fortified camp of the Engliſh. He therefore determined to
                    make a powerful diverſion in England, in order to oblige Edward to abandon the
                    undertaking. By order of the king, 15,000 men entered England by the weſtern
                    marches. They had concerted a plan for carrying off the queen of England from
                    her <hi rend="italic">reſidence</hi> near York; but being diſappointed in this
                    attempt, they laid waſte Yorkſhire. The arch- biſhop of York haſtily collected a
                    numerous body of commons and eccleſiaſtics, with whom he encountered the Scots
                    at Mitton, near Borough-bridge, in the north- riding of Yorkſhire. The Engliſh
                    were inſtantly routed; 3000 were left dead on the field, and great part of thoſe
                    who fled periſhed in the river Swale. In this action 300 eccleſiaſtics loſt
                    their lives. The news of this ſucceſsful inroad alarmed the beſiegers of
                    Berwick. The barons whoſe eſtates lay to the ſouthward remote from the Scottiſh
                    depredations were eager for continuing the ſiege. But they were oppoſed by thoſe
                    of the north; who were no leſs eager to abandon the enterpriſe, and return to
                    the defence of their own country. With them the earl of Lancaſter concurred in
                    opinion; who, underſtanding that his favourite manor of Pontefract was expoſed
                    to the ravages of the Scots, departed with all his adherents. Edward, upon this,
                    drew off the remainder of his army, and attempted to intercept Randolph and
                    Douglas; but they eluded him, and returned, in ſafety to Scotland.</p>
                <p>The unſucceſsſul event of this laſt attempt induced Edward ſerioufly to think of
                    peace; and accordingly a truce between the two nations was concluded on the 21ſt
                    of December 1319; which interval of tranquillity the Scots made uſe of in
                    addreſſing a manifeſto to the pope in juſtification of their cauſe. This was
                    drawn up in a ſpirited manner, and made a very conſiderable alteration in the
                    councils of Rome. The pope, foreſeeing that Robert would not he terrified into
                    ſubmiſſions, ordered Edward to make peace with him in the beſt manner he could.
                    A negociation was accordingly ſet on foot, which ſoon terminated ineffectually;
                    the truce was not renewed, and in 1322 a mutual invaſion took place. The Scots
                    penetrated into Lancaſhire by the weſtern marches; and, after plundering the
                    country, returned home with an extraordinary booty; while Edward made great
                    preparations for an expedition into Scotland, which took place in Auguſt the
                    ſame year. In this, however, he was not attended with ſucceſs. Robert had cauſed
                    all the cattle to be driven off, and all the effects of any value to be removed
                    from Lothian and the Merſe; fixing his camp at Culroſs, on the north ſide of the
                    frith of Forth. His orders for removing the cattle were ſo punctually obeyed,
                    that, according to common tradition, the only prey which fell into the hands of
                    the Engliſh was a lame bull at Tranent in Eaſt Lothian. Edward, however, ſtill
                    proceeded, and penetrated as far as Edinburgh, but without any hopes of ſubduing
                    the kingdom. His proviſions being conſumed, many of his ſoldiers periſhed for
                    want; and he was obliged at laſt to retire without having ſeen an enemy. On
                    their return, his ſoldiers burnt the abbeys of Holyrood, Melroſs, Dryburgh,
                    &amp;c. killed many of the monks, and committed other ſacrileges: but when
                    they returned to their own country, and began again to enjoy a plentiful living,
                    they indulged themſelves in ſuch exceſſes as were productive of mortal diſeaſes;
                    inſomuch that, according to an Engliſh hiſtorian, almoſt one half of the great
                    army which Edward had brought from England with him were deſtroyed either by
                    hunger or gluttony.</p>
                <p>No ſooner were the Engliſh retired than they were purſued by the Scots, who laid
                    ſiege to the caſtle of Norham. Edward lay at the abbey of Biland in Yorkſhire,
                    with a body of troops advantageouſly polled in the neighbourhood. The Scots,
                    invited, as is ſaid, by ſome traitors about the king’s perſon, attempted to
                    ſurpriſe him; and it was with the utmoſt difficulty that he made his eſcape to
                    York, abandoning all his baggage and treaſure to the enemy. The Engliſh camp was
                    ſuppoſed to be acceſſible only by a narrow paſs, but Douglas undertook to force
                    it, and Randolph preſented himſelf as a volunteer in this dangerous ſervice
                    under bis friend Douglas. The Highlanders and men of the Iſles climbed the
                    precipice on which the Engliſh camp flood, and the enemy were driven out with
                    great loſs. The Scots purſued them to the very gates of York, waſted the country
                    without controul, and returned home unmoleſted.</p>
                <p>Edward, diſheartened by repeated Ioffes, agreed to ceſſation of arms “with the
                    men of Scotland who were engaged in war with him.” But the king of Scotland
                    would not conſent to it in that form; however, he gave his conſent, on the
                    proper form being employed, to which Edward now made no objection. This treaty
                    was concluded on the 30th of March 1323, and was to endure until the 12th of
                    June 1336. It was agreed, that, during the continuance of it, no new fortreſſes
                    ſhould be erected in Cumberland, to the north of the Tyne, or in the counties of
                    Berwick, Roxburgh, or Dumfries; and by a very ſingular article it was provided,
                    that “Bruce and the people of Scotland might procure abſolution from the pope;
                    but in caſe there was no peace concluded before the expiration of the<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0769.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0763"/> truce, that
                    the ſentence of excommunication ſhould revive.” The treaty was ratified by
                    Robert, under the ſtyle of the <hi rend="italic">king of Scotland,</hi> 7th June
                    1323.</p>
                <p>The next care of Robert was to reconcile himſelf to the church, and to obtain
                    from the pope the title of <hi rend="italic">king,</hi> which had been ſo long
                    denied him; which at laſt, though not without great difficulty, was obtained.
                    This year a ſon was born to the king of Scotland at Dunfermline, and named <hi
                        rend="italic">David.</hi> The court-poets of the time foretold, that this
                    infant would one day rival his father’s fame, and prove victorious over the
                    English. But ſcarce had this future hero come into the world, when a rival began
                    to make his appearance. John Baliol, the unfortunate king of Scotland, had long
                    been dead; but left a ſon named <hi rend="italic">Edward,</hi> heir to his,
                    pretenſions to the crown. The young prince had reſided on his paternal eſtate in
                    Normandy, neglected and forgotten; but in 1324 was called to the court of
                    England, for the purpoſe, undoubtedly, of ſetting him up as a rival to young
                    David Bruce, in caſe his father, now broken with fatigues, ſhould die in a ſhort
                    time. The negociations for peace, however, ſtill went on; but the commiſſioners
                    appointed for this purpoſe made little progreſs, by reaſon of demands for feudal
                    ſovereignty ſtill made by the Engliſh. The reconciliation with the church was
                    alſo broken off, by reaſon of the Scots keeping poſſeſſion of Berwick. This had
                    been taken during the papal truce; and Robert thought proper ſtill to lie under
                    the ſentence of excommunication rather than to part with ſuch an important
                    fortreſs.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of the year 1327, Edward II. was depoſed, and ſucceeded by his
                    ſon Edward III. then in his 15th year. He renewed the negociations for peace,
                    and ratified the truce which his father had made; but hearing that the Scots had
                    reſolved to invade England if a peace was not immediately concluded, he ſummoned
                    his barons to meet him in arms at Newcaſtle, and fortified York.—We are not
                    certainly informed of the reaſons which induced the Scots at this time to
                    diſregard the truce; however, it is certain, that on the 15th of June 1327,
                    Douglas and Randolph invaded England by the weſtern marches, with an army of
                    20,000 horſemen. Againſt them Edward III. led an army, conſiſting, at the loweſt
                    calculation, of 30,000 men, who aſſembled at Durham on the 13th of July. The
                    Scots proceeded with the utmoſt cruelty, burning and deſtroying every thing as
                    they went along; and on the 18th of the ſame month, the Engliſh diſcovered them
                    by the ſmoke and flames which marked their progreſs. They marched forward in
                    order of battle towards the quarter where the ſmoke was perceived; but, meeting
                    with no enemy for two days, they concluded that the Scots had retired.
                    Diſencumbering themſelves then of their heavy baggage, they reſolved by a forced
                    march to reach the river Tyne, and, by poſting themſelves on the north bank of
                    that river; to intercept the Scots on their return. On the 20th of July, the
                    cavalry having left the infantry behind, croſſed the river at Haidon: but before
                    the reſt of the army could come up, the river was ſo ſwelled by ſudden rains,
                    that it could no longer be forded; and thus the troops remained divided for
                    ſeveral days, without any accommodation for quarters, and in the greateſt want
                    of proviſions and forage. The ſoldiers now began to murmur; and it was reſolved
                    again to proceed ſouthwards. The king proclaimed a reward of lands, to the value
                    of 1001. yearly for life, to the perſon who ſhould firſt diſcover the enemy “on
                    dry ground, where they might be attacked;” and many knights and eſquires ſwam
                    acroſs the river on this ſtrange errand. The army continued its march for three
                    days without any news of the Scots; but on the fourth day, certain accounts of
                    them were brought by an eſquire, Thomas Rokeſhy: who reported, that “the Scots
                    had made him priſoner; but that their leaders, underſtanding his buſineſs, had
                    ſet him at liberty; laying, that they had remained for eight days on the ſame
                    ground, as ignorant of the motions of the Engliſh as the Engliſh were of theirs,
                    and that they were deſirous and ready to combat.” With this man for their guide,
                    the Engliſh ſoon came in view of the Scots. They were advantageouſly poſted on a
                    riſing ground, having the river Were in front, and their flanks ſecured by rocks
                    and precipices. The Engliſh diſmounted and advanced, hoping to allure the Scots
                    from their ſtrong poſt; but in vain. Edward then ſent a herald to Randolph and
                    Douglas, with a meſſage in the ſtyle of chivalry: “Either,” ſays he, “ſuffer me
                    to paſs the river, and leave me room for ranging my forces; or do you paſs the
                    river, and I will leave you room to range yours; and thus ſhall we fight on
                    equal terms.” To this the Scottiſh commanders anſwered, “We will do neither. On
                    our road hither we have burnt and ſpoiled the country; and here we are fixed
                    while to us it ſeems good; and if the king of England is offended, let him come
                    over and chaſtiſe us.”</p>
                <p>The armies continued in fight of each other for two days; after which the
                    Engliſh, underſtanding that their enemies were diſtreſſed for proviſions,
                    reſolved to maintain a cloſe blockade, and to reduce them by famine. Next day,
                    however, they were ſurpriſed to find that the Scots had ſecretly decamped, and
                    taken poſt two miles up the river in ground ſtill ſtronger, and of more
                    difficult acceſs, amidſt a great wood. The Engliſh encamped oppoſite to them
                    near Stanhope park. At midnight Douglas undertook a moſt deſperate enterpriſe,
                    ſomewhat reſembling thoſe of the ancient heroes. With 200 horſemen he approached
                    the Engliſh camp, and entered it under the guiſe of a chief commander calling
                    the rounds. Having thus eluded the centinels, he paſſed on to the royal
                    quarters, overthrew every thing that oppoſed him, and furiouſly aſſaulted the
                    king’s tent. The domeſtics of Edward deſperately defended their maſter; and his
                    chaplain, with many others of his houſehold, were ſlain. However, the king
                    himſelf eſcaped; and Douglas, diſappointed of his prey, ruſhed through the
                    enemy, and effected a retreat with inconſiderable loſs. —The following day, the
                    Engliſh learned from a priſoner, that orders had been iſſued in the Scottiſh
                    camp for all men to hold themſelves in readineſs that evening to follow the
                    banner of Douglas: on which, apprehending an attack in the night, they prepared
                    for battle, lighting great fires, and keeping a ſtrict watch; but in the
                    morning, they were informed by two trumpeters whom they had taken priſoners,
                    that the Scots had decamped before midnight, and were returning to their own
                    country. This report could ſcarcely be credited, and the army remained for ſome
                    hours in order of battle; but at length ſome ſcouts having croſſed the<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0770.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0764"/> river,
                    returned with certain intelligence that the Scottiſh camp was totally deserted:
                    which when the young king of England was certainly informed of, he burſt into
                    tears; for the enterpriſe, which thus terminated in diſappointment and
                    dishonour, had coſt an immenſe ſum. Every preparation had been made for oppoſing
                    an enemy, and auxiliaries had even been procured at a moſt enormous expence from
                    Hainault. Theſe auxiliaries conſiſted of heavy-armed cavalry; and they were now
                    ſo much worn out, that they could ſcarcely move. Their horſes were all dead, or
                    had become unſerviceable, in a campaign of three weeks; ſo that they were
                    obliged to procure horſes to convey themselves to the ſouth of England. Edward
                    having reſted at Durham for ſome days, marched to York, where he diſbanded his
                    army. Barbour, a Scots historian, relates, that there Was a moraſs in the rear
                    of the Scottiſh camp, which he calls the <hi rend="italic">two-mile mora</hi> ſ
                        <hi rend="italic">s;</hi> that the Scots made a way over it with bruſhwood,
                    removing it as they went along,‘that the Engliſh might not purſue them by the
                    ſame way. The Engliſh hiſtoriarts are filled with deſcriptions of the ſtrange
                    appearance of the deſerted camp of the Scots. They found there a number of ſkins
                    ſtretched between ſtakes, which ſerved for kettles to boil their meat; and for
                    bread, each ſoldier carried along with him a bag of oatmeal, of which he made
                    takes, toaſting them upon thin iron plates, which appear to have been part of
                    their armour.</p>
                <p>On the return Of Douglas and Randolph, the king led his army againſt the eastern
                    borders, and beſieged the caſtle of Norham. However, in 1328, Edward, wearied
                    out with continual loſſes and diſappointments, Conſented to a perpetual peace
                    between the two kingdoms on the following conditions. 1. The ſtone on which the
                    kings of Scotland were wont to fit at the time of their coronation, ſhall be
                    reſtored to the Scots. 2. The king of England engages to employ his good offices
                    at the papal court for obtaining a revocation of all ſpiritual proceſſes
                    depending before the holy ſee againſt the king of Scots, or againſt his kingdom
                    or ſubjects. 3. For theſe cauſes, and in Order to make reparation for the
                    ravages Committed in England by the Scots, the king of Scots ſhall pay 30,000
                    merks to the king of England. 4. Reſtitution ſhall be made of the poſſeſſions
                    belonging to eccleſiaſtics in either kingdom, whereof they may have been
                    deprived during the war. 5. But there ſhall not be any reſtitution made of
                    inheritances which have fallen into the hands of the king of England or of the
                    king of Scots, by reaſon of the war between the two nations, or through the
                    forfeiture of former poſſeſſors. 6. Johanna, ſiſter of the king of England,
                    ſhall be given in marriage to David, the ſon and heir to the king of Scots. 7.
                    The king of Scots ſhall provide the princeſs Johanna in a jointure of 2000 l.
                    yearly, ſecured on lands and rents, according to a reasonable eſtimation. 8. If
                    either of the parties ſhall fail in performing theſe conditions, he ſhall pay
                    2000 pounds of ſilver to the papal treaſury.</p>
                <p>This peace, ratified at Northampton, is ſtyled <hi rend="italic">ignominious</hi>
                    by the Engliſh hiſtorians, and the marriage df the Scots prince to the king of
                    England’s ſiſter, denominated <hi rend="italic">that baſe marriage;</hi> because
                    at this time all pretenſions to fovereignty over Scotland were given up, they
                    had in vain attempted to eſtabliſh them by a ruinous war of 20 years. The
                    marriage of the infant prince was celebrated on the 12th of July 1328,</p>
                <p>On the 7th of June 1329 died Robert Bruce, unqueſtionably the greateſt of all the
                    Scottiſh monarchs. His death ſeems to have been occaſioned by the exceſſive
                    fatigues of military ſervice; and his diſeafe, called by the hiſtorians of thoſe
                    times a leproſy, was probably an inveterate scurvy, occaſioned by his way of
                    living. He died at the age of 55. He was married to Iſabella, daughter of Donald
                    the tenth carl of Marr; by whom he had a daughter named Marjory, married to
                    Walter the ſteward of Scotland; whose huſband died in 1326. The ſecond wife of
                    Robert was Eliſabeth, the daughter of Aymer de Burgh earl of Ulſter. By her he
                    had a ſon, David II.; a daughter named Margaret, married to William earl of
                    Sutherland ; another, named Matilda, married to an eſquire named Thomas Iſaac;
                    and Eliſabeth, married to Sir Walter Oliphant or Gaſk. He had alſo a natural ſon
                    named Robert.</p>
                <p>That king Robert I. was a man of unqueſtionable virtue and humanity, as well as
                    unequalled in the knowledge of the military art, muſt be evident from many
                    particulars already related. The only queſtionable part of his character is his
                    ſevere puniſhment of a conſpiracy formed againſt him in the year 1320; a
                    relation of which, to avoid interrupting our detail of more important matters,
                    we have deferred till now.—The chief of the conſpirators were William de Soulis,
                    whoſe anceſtor had been a candidate for the crown of Scotland; the counteſs of
                    Strathern, and ſome other perſons of high rank. The counteſs diſcovered the
                    plot; after which Soulis confeſſed the whole, and was puniſhed with perpetual
                    impriſonment; as well as the counteſs, notwithſtanding her having made the
                    diſcovery. Gilbert de Malyerb and John de Logie, both knights, and Richard Brown
                    an eſquire, were put to death as traitors: but the, perſon moſt lamented was Sir
                    David de Brechin, for his bravery ſtyled <hi rend="italic">the flοwer of
                        chivalry.</hi> He was nephew to the king, and ſerved with great reputation
                    againſt the Saracens. To him the conſpirators, after having exacted an oath of
                    ſecrecy, revealed their deſigns. He condemned their undertaking, and refuſed to
                    ſhare in it; but did not diſcover it, on account of the oath he had taken. Yet
                    for this concealment he was tried as traitor, condemned and executed, without
                    regard to his perſonal merit or his relation to the king. The conſpirators were
                    tried before the parliament at Scone in 1320; and this ſeſſion, in which ſo much
                    blood was ſhed, was long remembered by the vulgar under the name of the <hi
                        rend="italic">black parliament.</hi> Whether there was any thing real in
                    this conſpiracy, or whether the king only made uſe of this pretence to rid
                    himſelf of ſuch as were obnoxious to him, cannot now be known with
                    certainty.</p>
                <p>After the death of Robert, the administration was aſſumed by Randolph, in
                    conſequence of an act paſſed in 1318, by which he was appointed regent in caſe
                    of the king's death. In his new character he behaved himſelf in a moſt exemplary
                    manner; and by impartially diſchargiag the duties of his ſtation, and rigidly
                    adminiſtering juſtice, he ſecured the public tranquillity in the moſt perfect
                    manner. A ſevere exerciſe of juſtice was now rendered not only neceſſary, but
                        indispensable.<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0771.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0765"/> During a long courſe of war, the common people
                    had been accustomed to plunder and bloodſhed; and having now no Engliſh enemies
                    to employ them, they robbed and murdered one another. The methods by which
                    Randolph repreſſed theſe crimes were much the ſame with thoſe which have been
                    adopted in latter times; for he made the counties liable for the ſeveral
                    robberies committed within their bounds. He even ordered the farmers and
                    labourers not to houſe the tools employed by them in agriculture during the
                    night-time, that the ſheriff’s officers might be the more vigilant in ſecuring
                    them. He gave orders for ſeverely puniſhing all vagabonds, and obliged them to
                    work for their livelihood; making proclamation, that no man ſhould be admitted
                    into a town or borough who could not earn his bread by his labour. Theſe
                    regulations were attended with the moſt ſalutary effects. A fellow who had
                    ſecreted his own plough-irons, pretending that they were ſtolen, being detected
                    by the ſheriſſ’s officers, was inſtantly hanged. A certain man having killed a
                    prieſt, went to Rome, and obtained abſolution from the pope; after which he
                    boldly returned to Scotland. Randolph ordered him to be tried, and, on his
                    conviction, to be executed:: “Becauſe,” ſaid he, “although the pope may grant
                    abſolution from the ſpiritual conſequences of ſin, he cannot ſcreen offenders
                    from civil puniſhment.”</p>
                <p>King Robert, juſt before his death, had deſired that his heart might be depoſited
                    in our Saviour’s ſepulchre at Jeruſalem; and on this errand the great commander
                    Douglas was employed, who ſet ſail in June 1530 with a numerous and ſplendid
                    retinue. He anchored off Sluys in Flanders, the great emporium of the low
                    countries, where he expected to find companions in his pilgrimage; but learning
                    that Alphonſus XI. the young king of Leon and Caſtile, was engaged in a war with
                    Oſmyn the Moor, he could not reſiſt the temptation of fighting againſt the
                    enemies of Chriſtianity. He met with an honourable reception at the court of
                    Spain, and readily obtained leave to enter into what was thought the common
                    cauſe oſ Chriſtianity. The Spaniards first came in ſight of their enemy, near
                    Theba, a caſtle on the frontiers of Andaluſia, towards the kingdom of Granada.
                    The Moors were defeated; but, Douglas, giving way to his impetuous valour,
                    pursued</p>
                <p>the enemy too eagerly, and throwing among them the caſket which contained the
                    heart of his ſovereign, cried out, “Now paſs thou onward as thou went wont;
                    Douglas will follow thee or die.” The fugitives rallied and ſurrounded Douglas;
                    who, with a few of his followers, was killed in attempting to reſcue Sir Waller
                    St Clair of Roflin. His body was brought back to Scotland, and interred in the
                    church of Douglas. His countrymen perpetuated his memory by beſtowing upon him
                    the epithet of th <hi rend="italic">e good Sir James Douglas.</hi> He was one of
                    the greateſt commanders of the age; and is ſaid to have been engaged in 70
                    Battles, 57 of which he gained, and was defeated in 13. —Of him it is reported,
                    that meeting with an officer at the court of Alphonſus, who had his face quite
                    disfigured with fears, the latter ſaid to him, “It aſtoniſhes me, that you, who
                    are ſaid to have ſeen ſo much ſervice, ſhould have no marks of wounds on your
                    face.” “Thank heaven,” anſwered Douglas, “I had always an arm to protect my
                    face.”</p>
                <p>In 1331, Edward Baliol began to renew his pretenſions to the crown of Scotland,
                    about the fame time that David II. and his conſort Johanna were crowned at
                    Scone; which ceremony was performed on the 24th of November. Some hiſtorians
                    relate, that he was excited to this attempt by one Twynham Lowriſon, a perſon
                    who had been excommunicated for refusing to do penance for adultery, and
                    afterwards was obliged to fly on account of his having way-laid the official,
                    beat him, and extorted a ſum of money from him. But however this may be, it
                    uncertain, that in this year differences began to ariſe with England, on the
                    following account. It had been provided by an article of the treaty of
                    Northampton, that “Thomas lord Wake of Ledel, Henry de Beaumont, called <hi
                        rend="italic">earl of Buchan,</hi> and Henry de Percy, ſhould be reſtored to
                    their eſtates, of which the king of Scots, by reaſon of the war between the two
                    nations, had taken poſſeſſion.” This article had been executed with reſpect to
                    Percy, but not to the other two; and though Edward had repeatedly complained of
                    this neglect, he could not obtain any satisfaction<note anchored="true" n="10"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(g)</hi> As this is
                            an important period of hiſtory, we ſhall here transcribe the opinion of
                            lord Hailes concerning the cauſes of this ſtrange delay of executing an
                            article ſeemingly of little importance where a nation was concerned. “By
                            the treaty of Northampton," ſays she, “all the claims of the Engliſh
                            Batons to inheritances in Scotland were diſregarded, excepting thoſe of
                            Henry de Percy, Thomas lord Wake of Ledel, and Henry de Beaumont. Percy
                            procured ſatisfaction: but the others did not.</p><p>“Henry de Beaumont,
                            in the reign of Edward II. had aſſociated himſelf with the ability
                            againſt the D’Efpenſers, and on that account had ſuffered impriſonment
                            and exile. He aided queen Iſabella in the invaſion which proved the
                            cauſe of the depoſition, captivity, and death of her huſband. Although,
                            under the adminiſtration of Mortimer, he had obtained a ſhare in the
                            partition of the ſpoils of the D’Lſpeaſers, he perſiſted in oppoſing the
                            meaſures of the new favourite; and although his own intereſts were
                            ſecured by the treaty of Northampton, he boldly exclaimed againſt the
                            injuſtice done to the other barons by that treaty. He joined the princes
                            of the blood-royal in their attempt to reſcue the young king from the
                            hands of Iſabella and her minion, and place him in their own; and, on
                            the failure of that ill-adviſed conspiracy, he again took refuge in
                            foreign parts. It appears that lord Wake, having followed the political
                            opinions of Henry de Beaumont, was involved in like calamities and
                            diſgrace. While the queen-dowager and Mortimer retained their influence,
                            the claims of thoſe two barons were altogether overlooked: But within
                            forty-eight hours after the. execution of Mortimer, a peremptory demand
                            was made by Edward III. to have their inheritance reſtored.</p><p>“The
                            demand was unexpected and alarming. Made at the very moment of the fall
                            of Iſabella and Mortimer, <pb n="766"/> and in behalf of men who
                            had loudly proteſted againſt the treaty of Northampton, it indicated a
                            total and perilous change in the ſyſtem of the Engliſh.</p><p>“Randolph,
                            of late years, had beheld extraordinary viciſſitudes in England. The
                            D’Eſpenſers alternately perſecuted and triumphant, and at length abaſed
                            in the duſt: The fugitive Mortimer elevated to ſupreme authority,
                            victorious over the princes of the bloody-royal, and then dragged to a
                            gibbet. Hence it was natural for Randolph to wiſh, and even to look, for
                            ſome new revolution, which might prove more favourable to the Scottiſh
                            intereſts. Meanwhile, with great reaſon and good policy, he delayed the
                            reſtitution of the inheritances claimed under the treaty of Northampton,
                            in behalf of the avowed oppoſers of that treaty.</p><p>Beſides, it was
                            neceſſary for Randolph to be aſſured that the Engliſh, while they urged
                            the performance of one article of that treaty, did, on their part,
                            ſincerely purpoſe to perform its more important articles, by continuing
                            to acknowledge the ſucceſſion in the houſe of Bruce, and the
                            independency of the Scottiſh nation.</p><p>“Of this, however, there was
                            much reaſon to doubt. For the Engliſh king had taken Baliol under his
                            protection, and had granted him a paſſport to come into England, with
                            permiſſion to reſide there during a whole year, (10th October 1330).
                            Theſe things had no friendly or pacific appearance.</p><p>“Be this as it
                            will, the event too fatally juſtified the apprehenſions of Randolph;
                            for, while Edward III. was demanding reſtitution of the eſtates reſerved
                            by the treaty of Northampton, his ſubſects were arming in violation of
                            that treaty.</p><p>“It is remarkable, that, on the 24th March 1331-2,
                            Edward appears to have known of the hoſtile aſſociation of the
                            diſinherited barons. His words are, ‘Quia ex relatu accepimus
                            plurimorum, quod diverſi homines de regno noſtro, et alii (meaning
                            Baliol and his attendants), pacem inter nos, et Robertum de Brus, nuper
                            Regem Scotorum, initam et confirmatam infringere machinantes, diversas

                            T. iv. p. 511. And yet, on the 22d April following, he demanded
                            reſtitution of the inheritance of lord Wake, one of the barons in arms;”

                <p>The diſinherited batons now reſolved to invade Scotland, though their force
                    conſiſted of no more than 3000<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0772.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0766"/> infantry, and 400 men at arms. Edward would not
                    permit them to enter Scotland by the uſual way, as he himſelf did not yet chooſe
                    openly to take part in their quarrel. For this reaſon they were obliged to take
                    ſhipping, and landed at a place called <hi rend="italic">Ravenſhare,
                        Ravenspur,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ravensburgh,</hi> at the mouth of the

                            overwhelmed by the ſea many centuries ago.</p></note> (<hi
                        rend="smallcaps">h).</hi> Randolph, having intelligence of the Engliſh
                    preparations, had marched an army to the frontiers of Eaſt Lothian; but, being
                    afterwards informed of the naval armament, he marched northwards; but died at
                    Muſſelburgh, ſix miles eaſt of Edinburgh, on the 20th of July 1332. With him
                    died the glory of Scotland. The earl of Marr, a man whoſe only merit conſiſted
                    in his being related to the royal family, was choſen to ſucceed him in the
                    regency.—Edward, in the mean time, fell upon a moſt curious expedient to ſhow
                    the juſtice of his cauſe. In March 1332, he had publiſhed a prohibition for any
                    perſon to infringe the treaty of Northampton. The diſinherited lords had been
                    ſuffered to embark, expreſsly for the purpoſe of invading Scotland, after this
                    prohibition was publiſhed. <hi rend="italic">After they were gone,</hi> Henry de
                    Percy was empowered to puniſh thoſe who ſhould preſume to array themſelves in
                    contempt of his prohibition; and becauſe he underſtood that the Scots were
                    arming in order to repel thoſe invaders whom Edward had indirectly ſent againſt
                    them, he empowered Henry de Percy to arm againſt them.</p>
                <p>On the 31st of July, Edward Baliol and his aſſociates landed in the neighbourhood
                    of Kinghorn, on the Forth; routed the earl of Fife, who oppoſed them; and
                    marched next day to Dunfermline. Having then ordered his fleet to wait for him
                    at the mouth of the Tay, he proceeded northwards, and encamped on the Miller’s
                    acre at Forteviot, with the river Earn in front. Nothing, however, could be more
                    dangerous than his ſituation at preſent, and his deſtruction would have been
                    inevitable. The earl of Marr was encamped with a numerous army on the oppoſite
                    bank of the river Earn, in the neighbourhood of Duplin; and another, nearly as
                    numerous, had advanced from the ſouth, through the Lothians and Sfirlingſhire,
                    and fixed its quarters at Auchterarder, eight miles to the west of Forteviot.
                    Historians differ as to the number of the two armies. Fordun ſays, that the
                    regent had with him 30,000 men, and the earl of March as many; and that Baliol
                    had between 500 and 600 men at arms, that is, horſemen completely armed.
                    Hemingford reckons each of the Scots armies at 40,000, and Baliol’s at 500 armed
                    men. Knyghton ſays, that Baliol, when he landed in Fife, had 300 armed men, and
                    3000 more of different forts; but that he had in all only 2500 men in his camp
                    at Earn. In this deſperate ſituation, the Engliſh general formed a deſign of
                    attacking the Scots in their camp. They were directed to a ford by Andrew Murray
                    of Tullibardine. The Scots kept no watch, but abandoned themſelves to
                    intemperance and riotous mirth; while their enemies, led by Alexander Moubray,
                    croſſed the river at midnight. They aſcended a riſing ground, came unperceived
                    on the right flank of the Scottiſh army, and made a dreadful ſlaughter. At the
                    first attack, young Randolph halted with 300 men at arms to oppoſe the enemy;
                    and being ſeconded by Murdoch earl of Menteith, Alexander Fraſer, and Robert
                    Bruce natural ſon to the late king, he gave a check te the Engliſh, and
                    maintained the combat on equal terms. But now the regent himſelf, along with the
                    whole multitude, ruſhed forward to battle without the leaſt order: ſo that while
                    the hindmoſt preſſed on, the foremoſt were thrown down, trodden upon, and
                    ſuffocated. The ſlaughter laſted many hours, and the remains of this vaſt army
                    were utterly diſperſed. Many men of eminence were killed; among whom were Donald
                    earl of Marr, author of the whole cataſtrophe; Thomas earl of Moray, Murdoch
                    earl of Menteith, Robert earl of Carrick,<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0773.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0767"/> Alexander Fraſer, and Robert Bruce. The
                    ſlaughter of the infantry and of the men at arms was very great; the moſt
                    probable accounts make it 2000 men at arms, and upwards of 13,000 common
                    ſoldiers. The loſs of the Engliſh was inconſiderable.</p>
                <p>The day after this victory, Baliol took poſſeſſion of Perth; and, apprehending an
                    attack from the earl of March, cauſed the ditch to be cleared, and the town to
                    be fortified with palliſadoes. The firſt information which the earl received of
                    this dreadful defeat was from a common ſoldier, who fled from the place mortally
                    wounded. When this poor wretch came up, he had time to do no more than to ſhow
                    his wounds; after which he fell down, and expired. On his arrival at the field
                    of battle, he found a dreadful confirmation of the intelligence given by the
                    ſoldier; but inſtead of taking his meaſures with any prudence, he and his men
                    hurried on headlong to Perth, actuated only by a blind impulfe to revenge. At
                    firſt they deſigned to aſſault the place; but their hearts failing them, they
                    next determined to reduce it by famine. This, however, could not be done unleſs
                    the Scots were maſters at ſea. One John Crab, a Flemiſh engineer (who had
                    diſtinguiſhed himſelf by deſtroying the famous engine called the <hi
                        rend="italic">ſow</hi> at the ſiege of Berwick), had continued for many
                    years to annoy the Engliſh on the eaſtern coaſts. After the blockade of Perth
                    was formed, he came with ten veſſels to the mouth of the Tay, where the Engliſh
                    fleet was, and took the ſhip belonging to Henry de Beaumont; but ſoon after all
                    his ten veſſels were burnt by the Engliſh in a general engagement. After this
                    the blockade of Perth was raiſed, the earl of March diſhanded his army, and
                    Edward Baliol was crowned king of Scotland at Scone, on the 24th of September
                    1332.</p>
                <p>The new monarch was no ſooner put in poſſeſſion of the kingdom, than he left
                    Perth in the hands ot the earl of Fife, while he himſelf repaired to the
                    ſouthern parts of the kingdom. But the party of king David was far from being
                    extinguiſhed. Baliol was ſcarce gone, when the town of Perth was ſurpriſed, and
                    its fortifications razed, by James Fraſer, Simon Fraſer, and Robert Keith. The
                    earl of Fife was made priſoner, with his family and vaſſals. Andrew Murray of
                    Tullibardine, who had directed the Engliſh to a ford on the river Earn, was put
                    to death as a traitor. Such of the Scots as ſtill adhered to the intereſt of
                    their infant prince, choſe Sir Andrew Murray of Bothwell regent. He was a brave
                    and active man, but had not as yet ſufficient force to attempt any thing
                    conſiderable.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, Baliol behaved in a moſt ſcandalous manner. At Roxburgh, he
                    made a ſolemn ſurrender of the liberties of Scotland; acknowledged Edward for
                    his liege-lord; and, as if this had not been ſufficient, he became bound to put
                    him in poſſeſſion of the town, caſtle, and territory of Berwick, and of other
                    lands on the marches, extending in all to the yearly value of 2000 l. “on
                    account,” as the infiniment bears, “of the great honour and emoluments which we
                    have procured through the <hi rend="italic">ſuffrance</hi> of our lord the king,
                    and by the powerful and acceptable aid which we have received from his good
                    ſubjects.” He alſo proffered to marry the princeſs Johanna, whom he considered
                    as only betrothed to David Bruce, and to add 500 l. to</p>
                <p>her jointure; and this under the penalty of 10,000 l. to be appropriated as a
                    portion to the young lady, or otherwiſe diſpoſed of for her behoof. He further
                    engaged to provide for the maintenance of David Bruce as the king of England
                    ſhould adviſe; and, laſtly, he became bound to ſerve Edward in all his wars,
                    excepting in England, Wales, and Ireland, for the ſpace of a year together, with
                    200 men at arms, and all at his own charges; and he bound his ſuccessors to
                    perform the like ſervice with 100 men at arms. But afterwards Edward having
                    engaged to maintain him on the throne of Scotland, Baliol bound himſelf to ſerve
                    him in all his wars whatever.</p>
                <p>Though the greateſt part of the nation ſubmitted to this ſhameful treaty, it
                    rouſed the indignation of thoſe who wiſhed well to the liberties of their
                    country. John, the ſecond ſon of Randolph, now earl of Moray by the death of his
                    brother; Archibald, the youngeſt brother of the renowned Douglas; together with
                    Simon Fraſer, aſſembled a body of horſemen at Moffat in Annandale; and, ſuddenly
                    traverſing the country, aſſaulted Baliol unexpectedly at Annan. His brother
                    Henry made a gallant reſiſtance for ſome time but was at laſt overpowered with
                    numbers, and killed, together with ſeveral other perſons of diſtinction. Baliol
                    himſelf eſcaped almoſt naked, with ſcarce a Angle attendant, and fled to
                    England. After his departure, the Scots began to make depredations on the
                    Engliſh frontiers. Edward iſſued a proclamation, in which he ſolemnly averred,
                    that the Scots, by their hoſtile depredations, had violated the peace of
                    Northampton. Baliol, in the mean time, being joined by ſome Engliſh barons,
                    returned to Scotland; took and burnt a caſtle where Robert de Colville
                    commanded; and, eſtabliſhing his quarters in the neighbourhood of Roxburgh,
                    began to make preparations for beſieging Berwick. Juſt after his arrival,
                    Archibald Douglas, with 3000 men, invaded England by the weſtern marches,
                    plundered the country, and carried off much booty; in revenge for which, Sir
                    Anthony de Lucy made an inroad into Scotland, defeated and took priſoner Sir
                    William Douglas, celebrated in hiſtory by the appellation of <hi rend="italic"
                        >the knight of Liddeſdale,</hi> whom Edward cauſed to be put in irons. About
                    the ſame time, Sir Andrew Murray the regent attacked Baliol, with a view to
                    diſcomfit him before the reinforcements which he expected out of England could
                    arrive. A ſharp conflict enſued at Roxburgh, in which the regent, attempting to
                    reſcue a ſoldier, was taken priſoner: and thus Scotland was at once deprived of
                    its two ableſt commanders.</p>
                <p>Archibald Douglas was now declared regent; and Edward prepared to invade
                    Scotland, in order to take vengeance on its inhabitants, as he ſaid, for the
                    wrongs they had done, and to ſeek ſuch redreſs as might ſeem good to himſelf. He
                    ordered poſſeſſion to be taken of the isle of Man in his own name; and ſoon
                    after made it over to Sir William de Montague, who had' ſome claim of
                    inheritance in it. The chief deſign of Edward in this expedition, however, was
                    to obtain poſſeſſion of the town of Berwick, which had been already ceded to him
                    by Baliol. This appeared to the Scots a place of no leſs importance than it did
                    to Edward; and therefore they took all the precautions in their power to prevent
                    the loſs of it. The earl of March was appointed to command the caſtle, and
                        Sir.<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0774.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0768"/>
                    William Keith the town. The Scots made an obſtinate defence; yet it was evident
                    that they muſt soon have yielded if they had not been relieved. At length the
                    regent, with a numerous army, appeared in the neighbourhood. He endeavoured to
                    convey ſuccours into the town, or to provoke the enemies to quit the advantage
                    of the ground, and engage in battle. But all his efforts were in vain; the
                    Engliſh obſtructed every paſſage, and flood on the defenſive.</p>
                <p>The regent then entered Northumberland, waſted the country, and even aſſaulted
                    Bamborough castle, where Philippa the young queen of England had her residence.
                    He fondly imagined that Edward III. would have abandoned the ſiege of Berwick,
                    after the example of his father, in circumſtances not diſſimilar. Edward
                    nevertheleſs perſevered in his enterpriſe.</p>
                <p>During a general aſſault, the town was set on fire, and in a great meaſure
                    conſumed. The inhabitants having experienced the evils of a ſiege, and dreading
                    the worſe evils of a ſtorm, implored the earl of March and Sir William Keith to
                    ſeek terms of capitulation. A truce was obtained; and it was agreed, that the
                    town and caſtle ſhould be delivered up on terms fair and honourable, unleſs
                    ſuccours arrived before the hour of veſpers on the 19th July.</p>
                <p>It was ſpecially provided, “that Berwick ſhould be held as relieved, in case 200
                    men at arms, in a body, ſhould force their paſſage into the town.”</p>
                <p>By the treaty, Sir William Keith was permitted to have an interview with the
                    regent. He found him with his army in Northumberland; urged the neceſſity of his
                    return; and ſhowed him, that Berwick, if not inſtantly relieved, was loſt for
                    ever. Perſuaded by his importunities, the regent reſolved to combat the Engliſh,
                    and either to ſave Berwick or loſe the kingdom.</p>
                <p>On the afternoon of the 19th of July, the regent prepared for battle. He divided
                    his army into four bodies. The first was led by John earl of Moray, the ſon of
                    Randoloh; but as he was young and inexperienced in war, James and Simon Fraſer,
                    ſoldiers of approved reputation, were joined with him in the command. The ſecond
                    body was led by the Reward of Scotland, a youth of 16, under the infpection of
                    his uncle Sir James Stewart of Roſyth. The third body was led by the regent
                    himself, having with him the earl of Carrick and other barons of eminence. The
                    fourth body, or reſerve, appears to have been led by Hugh carl of Ross.</p>
                <p>The numbers of the Scottiſh army on that day are variouſiy reported by
                    hiſtorians. The continuator of Hemingford, an author of that age, and Knyghton,
                    who lived in the ſucceeding age, aſcertain their numbers with more precifion
                    than is generally required in historical facts.</p>
                <p>The continuator of Hemingford minutely records the numbers and arrangement of the
                    Scottiſh army. He ſays, that, beſides earls and other lords or great barons,
                    there were 55 knights, 1100 men at arms, and 13,500 of the commons lightly
                    armed, amounting in all to 14,655.</p>
                <p>With him Knyghton appears to concur, when his narrative is cleared from the
                    errors of ignorant or careleſs transcribers.</p>
                <p>It is probable, however, that the ſervants who tended the horſes of perſons of
                    diſtinction and of the men at arms, and the uſeleſs followers of the camp, were
                    more numerous than the actual combatants.</p>
                <p>The Engliſh were advantageoufly poſted on a rising ground at Halydon, with a
                    marſhy hollow in their front. Of their particular disρosition we are not
                    informed, further than that Baliol had the command of one of the wings.</p>
                <p>It had been provided by the treaty of capitulation, "That Berwick ſhould he
                    coſidered as relieved, in caſe 200 men at arms forced their paſſage into the
                    town." This the Scottiſh men at arms attempted; bet Edward, aware of their
                    purpoſe, oppoſed them in perſon, and repulſed them with great daughter. The
                    Scottiſh army ruſhed on to a general attack; but they had to deſcend into the
                    marſhy hollow before mounting the eminences of Halydon. After having struggled
                    with the difficulties of the ground, and after having been inceſſantly galled by
                    the Engliſh archers, they reached the enemy. Although fatigued and diſordered in
                    their ranks, they fought as it became men who had conquered under the banners,
                    of Robert Bruce. The Engliſh, with equal valour, had great advantages of
                    ſituation, and were better diſciplined than, their antagoniſts. The earl of Roſs
                    led the reſerve to attack in flank that wing where Baliol commanded; but he was
                    repulſed and ſlain. There fell with him Kenneth earl of Sutherland, and Murdoch
                    earl of Menteith.</p>
                <p>In the other parts of the field, the events were equally diſaſtrous. The regent
                    received a mortal wound, and the Scots everywhere gave way. In the field, and
                    during a purſuit for many miles, the number of ſlain and priſoners was ſo great,
                    that few of the Scottiſh army escaped.</p>
                <p>Beſides the earls of Ross, Sutherland, and Menteith, there were among the ſlain
                    Malcolm earl of Lenox, an aged baron; he had been one of the foremost to repair
                    to the ſtandard of Robert Bruce, and his last exertions were for his country:
                    Alexander Bruce earl of Carrick, who atoned for the ſhort defection from the
                    family of his benefactor; John Campbell earl of Athole, nephew of the late king;
                    James Fraſer, and Simon Fraser; John de Graham, Alexander de Lindeſay, Alan
                    Stewart,and many other perſonsof eminent rank.</p>
                <p>The Steward had two uncles, John and James. John was killed, and James mortally
                    wounded and made priſoner<note anchored="true" n="12" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>(I) Fordun, 1. xiii. c. 28. relates, that Sir James
                            Stewart was ſlain; the Engliſh historians, that he was mortally wounded
                            and made priſoner. It may be remarked, that at Halydon two Stewarts
                            fought under the banner of their chiefs; the one Alan of Dreghorn, the
                            paternal anceſtor of Charles I. and the other James of Roſyth, the
                            paternal anceſtor of Oliver Cromwell.</p></note> (I).</p>
                <p>The regent, mortally wounded, and abandoned on the field of battle, only lived to
                    ſee his army difcomfited and himſelf a priſoner.</p>
                <p>This victory was obtained with very inconsiderable<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0775.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0769"/> loſs. It is
                    related by the Engliſh hiſtorians, that, on the ſide of their countrymen, there
                    were killed one knight, one eſquire, and 12 foot-ſoldiers. Nor will this appear
                    altogether incredible, when we remember, that the Engliſh ranks remained
                    unbroken, annd that their archers, at a ſecure diſtance, inceſſantly annnoyed
                    the Scottiſh infantry.</p>
                <p>According to capitulation, the town and caſtle of Berwick ſurrendered. The
                    Engliſh king took twelve hoſtages, for ſecuring the fidelity of the citizens of
                    Berwick.</p>
                <p>Thus was the whole of Scotland reduced under the ſubjection of Baliol, excepting
                    a few fortreſſes; ſo that it became neceſſary to provide for the ſafety of the
                    young king and queen. Accordingly, they were conveyed to France, where they were
                    honourablyy entertained. Meanwhile, Baliol employed himſelf in making new
                    conceſſions to his liege-lord Edward; and in 1334 the work of ſubmiſſion was
                    completed by a ſolemn inſtrument drawn up by Baliol, in which he ſurrendered
                    great part of the Scottiſh dominions, to be for ever annexed to the crown of
                    England. In this inſtrument Baliol ſaid, that “he had formerly become bound to
                    make a grant to Edward of lands on the marches, to the amount of <hi
                        rend="italic">two thouſand-pound lands</hi>; that the Scottiſh parliament
                    had ratified his obligation; and that he had accordingly ſurrendered Berwick and
                    its territory; and now, for completely diſcharging his obligation, he made an
                    abſolute ſurrender to the Engliſh crown of the foreſts of Jedburgh, Selkirk, and
                    Ettrick; of the counties of Roxburgh, Peebles, and Dumnfries; together with the
                    county of Edinburgh, and the conſtabularies of Linlithgow and. Haddington.” This
                    extraordinary ſurrender was made with ſo much precipitation, that Baliol forgot
                    to except his own private eſtate out of it. This, however, was generouſly
                    restored to him by Edward; who proclaimed, that, “having already received
                    ſatisfaction in full, he had too much reverence for <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >God,</hi> juſtice, and good faith to man, to allow the ceſſion to be
                    prejudicial to the private rights of the king of Scots.” At the ſame time,
                    Baliol preſented himſelf before his liege-lord; did homage, and ſwore fealty,
                    “for the whole kingdom of Scotland and the iſles adjacent.”</p>
                <p>A quarrel now aroſe among the diſinherited lords, to whom this revolution had
                    been owing, which produced the worſt conſequences to the intereſt of Baliol. The
                    brother of Alexander de Moubray died, leaving daughters, but no iſſue-male.
                    Moubray having claimed a preference to the daughters of his brother, Baliol
                    countenanced his ſuit, and, as it appears, put him in poſſeſſion of the
                    inheritance. Henry de Beaumont earl of Buchan, and David de Strathbolgie or
                    Haſtings, earl of Athol, eſpouſed the cauſe of the heirs-general; but perceiving
                    that their ſolicitations were not heard, they left the court in diſguſt, and
                    retired to their castles about the end of Auguſt 1334. Baliol ſon perceived his
                    error in offending theſe two powerful lords; and in order to regain their
                    favour, diſmiſſed Moubbray, and conferred on David de Strathbolgie the whole
                    eſtates of the young Steward of Scotland. Thus he alienated the affections of
                    Moubray, and added to the power of the earl of Athol, who was by far too
                    powerful before.</p>
                <p>About this time Sir Andrew Murray of Bothhwell, having regained his freedom,
                    began to aſſemble the friends of liberty, and was immediately joined by Moubray.
                    In a moment every thing was in confuſion. Geffrey de Moubray, governor of
                    Roxburgh, revolted; Henry de Beaumont was beſieged in his caſtle of Dundarg by
                    Murray and Moubray, and forced to ſurrender, but obtained liberty to depart into
                    England. Richard Talbot, endeavouring to paſs into England with a body of
                    troops, was defeated and taken priſoner by Sir William Keith of Galſton. The
                    Steward of Scotland, who had lain concealed in the iſle of Bute ever ſince the
                    battle of Halidon, now paſſed over to the caſtle of Dunbarton, which was one of
                    the few forts remaining to king David. With the aſſiſtance of Dougal Campbell of
                    Lochow, he made himſelf maſter of the caſtle of Dunoon in Cowal. His tenants of
                    the iſle of Bute attacked and flew Alan de Lile the governor, and preſented his
                    head to their maſter. John the ſon of Gilbert, governor of the caſtle of Bute,
                    was made priſoner in the action. He ordered the garriſon to surrender, and
                    attached himſelf to the Scottiſh intereſt. Encouraged by theſe ſucceſſes, the
                    Steward entered his ancient inheritance of Renfrew, and compelled the
                    inhabitants to acknowledge the ſovereignty of David. Godfrey de Roſs, the
                    governor of Ayrſhire, ſubmitted to the Steward. The earl of Moray returned from
                    France, whither he had fled after the battle of Halidon, and was acknowdedged
                    regent along with the Steward. The earl, having raiſed a body of troops, marched
                    againſt the earl of Athol, compelled him to retire into Lochaber, and at laſt to
                    ſurrender; after which he embraced the party of the conquerors. Baliol was now
                    obliged to retire again into England, in order to ſolicit aſſiſtance from
                    Edward; and this was readily granted. Edward himſelf took the field at a very
                    unfavourable ſeaſon for military enterpriſes. His army was divided into two
                    parts. With the one Edward wasted Lothian, while Baliol did the like in Amandale
                    with the other; and, in the mean time, Patrick earl of March, notwithſtanding
                    the unfavourable poſture of affairs, renounced the allegiance he had ſworn to
                    England. His motive for this was, that though the kings of England had
                    maintained him in an independency dangerous to Scotland, he was aſſured that
                    they would never permit him to become formidable in a country which they
                    themſelves poſſeffed.</p>
                <p>The year 1335 is remarkable for the ſiege of Locheven caſtle by the Engliſh,
                    under John de Strivelin. This fort was built on a ſmall iſland, and very
                    difficult of acceſs. The Engliſh commander erected a fort in the cemetery of
                    Kinroſs; and at the lower end of the take, from whence runs the ſtream called
                        <hi rend="italic">the Water of Leven,</hi> he raiſed a ſtrong and lofty
                    bulwark, by means of which he hoped to lay the iſland under water, and oblige
                    the garriſon to ſurrender. But four of the Scots ſoldiers, having found means to
                    approach the bulwark undiſcovered, pierced it ſo dexterouſly, that the waters,
                    ruſhing out with a prodigious force, overflowed part of the Engliſh camp; and
                    the garriſon, ſallying out during the confuſion occaſioned by this unexpected
                    inundation, ſtormed and plundered the fort at Kinroſs. At this time the Engliſh
                    commander,·with many of his ſoldiers, happened to be abſent at Dunfermline,
                    celebrating the feſtival of St Margaret. On his return, he ſwore that he would
                    never deſiſt till<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0776.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0770"/> he had taken the place, and put the garriſon to
                    the ſword; however, his utmoſt efforts were at laſt baffled, and he was obliged,
                    notwithſtanding his oath, to deſiſt.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the regents aſſembled a parliament at Dairſy, near Cupar in
                    Fife; but no plan of defence could be fallen upon, by reaſon of the animosities
                    and factions which prevailed among the barons. Through the mediation of the
                    French, ſome terms of peace were propoſed; but being rejected by the Engliſh,
                    Edward again invaded Scotland, cruelly ravaging the country with one army, while
                    Baliol and the earl of Warrene did the ſame with another. Soon after this
                    invaſion, count Guy of Namur landed at Berwick with a conſiderable number of
                    men-at-arms, in the ſervice of the Engliſh. He advanced to the neighbourhood of
                    Edinburgh; but was defeated and taken priſoner by the earls of March and Moray,
                    and Sir Alexander Ramſay. In this engagement, one Richard Shaw, a Scottiſh
                    eſquire, was ſingled out by a combatant in the army of count Guy, and both
                    pierced each other with their ſpears; the ſtranger being ſtripped, was
                    diſcovered to be a woman. The earl of Moray treated Guy with the greateſt
                    reſpect, not only allowing him and the remainder of his troops to depart from
                    Scotland without moleſtation, but even attending him to the borders, accompanied
                    by William Douglas and his brother James. On his return, William de Preſſen,
                    warden of the caſtle and foreſt of Jedburgh, attacked and defeated his party;
                    James Douglas was killed, the earl himſelf taken priſoner, and carried into
                    England.</p>
                <p>Thus was the Scottiſh nation once more reduced to the brink of ruin. Alexander de
                    Mowbray, Geffrey de Mowbray, and ſome others, pretending powers from “the earl
                    of Athol and Robert the Steward of Scotland,” concluded a treaty with Edward at
                    Perth; the ſubſtance of which was, that all the Scots ſhould receive pardon, and
                    have their fees, lands, and offices reſtored, excepting those who by <hi
                        rend="italic">common qſſent</hi> in parliament ſhould be excluded. The
                    liberties of the church and the ancient laws and uſages of Scotland were to
                    remain in full force. All offices were to be filled with Scotſmen, excepting
                    that the king ſhould appoint whom he pleaſed within his regalities.</p>
                <p>The earl of Athol now began to perſecute with the utmoſt fury thoſe who wiſhed
                    well to the cauſe of Scotland. With 3000 men he besieged the caſtle of
                    Kildrommey, which had hitherto been the great refuge of king David’s party. Sir
                    Andrew Murray of Both- well reſolved at all events to attempt the reſcue of his
                    wife and family, who were ſhut up in this caſtle. With 1100 men he ſurpriſed
                    Athol in the foreſt of Kilblain. The earl's men, ſeized with a panic, fled and
                    diſperſed themſelves; on which their commander, refuſing to accept of quarter,
                    was killed. Sir Andrew Murray then aſſembled a parliament at Dunfermline, where
                    he was immediately appointed regent.</p>
                <p>In 1336, the king of England perceiving that the Scots were taken under the
                    patronage of France, reſolved to invade their country, and cruſh them at once
                    before they could have any assiſtance from their new allies. In this expedition
                    he penetrated as far as Inverneſs; but the Scots, commanded by Sir Andrew
                    Murray, avoided coming to a general action; ſo that Edward could not effect any
                    thing of conſequence.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of Aberdeen attacked one Thomas Roſheme, who had landed at
                    Dunottar. They were defeated but Roſheme fell in the action. Edward chaſtiſed
                    the vanquiſhed ſeverely for their temerity, and laid the town in aſhes. He then
                    began to repair the caſtles whoſe fortifications had been demoliſhed by king
                    Robert. He put in a ſtate of defence the caſtles of Dunottar, Kinclevin,
                    Lawrieſton, Stirling, Bothwell, Edinburgh, and Roxburgh; greatly augmented the
                    fortifications of Perth, and left a conſiderable body of troops in the place.
                    The Scots began to reduce theſe caſtles as ſoon as Edward was departed; and in
                    1337, under Sir Andrew Murray, invaded Cumberland. No great exploits, however,
                    were now performed on either ſide. Edward being employed in preparations for
                    invading France, had little leiſure to attend to the affairs of Scotland; and
                    the Scots, divided among themſelves, and deſtitute of thoſe leaders under whom
                    they had acquired ſo much glory, could not now annoy their enemies as formerly.
                    The moſt remarkable tranſaction was the ſiege of the caſtle of Dunbar, belonging
                    to the earl of March. The Engliſh commander was the earl of Saliſhury. The earl
                    of March was abſent; but his wife, the daughter of Randolph, from her complexion
                    commonly called <hi rend="italic">Black Agnes,</hi> undertook to defend it in
                    her huſhand’s abſence. The Engliſh again employed that huge machine called <hi
                        rend="italic">a sow,</hi> formerly mentioned in our account of the ſiege of
                    Berwick: it met with the ſame fate now as at that time; an huge ſtone, let fall
                    upon it from the top of the walls, cruſhed it to pieces. The Engliſh, baffled in
                    every attack, turned the ſiege into a blockade; but Sir Alexander Ramſay having;
                    found means to enter it with 40 reſolute men, the garriſon made a ſally, and cut
                    in pieces the advanced guard of the enemy. The Engliſh, diſheartened by ſo many
                    misfortunes, abandoned the enterprise.</p>
                <p>In 1338, Sir Andrew Murray the regent died, and was ſucceeded in his office by
                    Robert the Steward of Scotland. In 1339 he reduced the town of Perth and the
                    caſtle of Stirling; and gained over to the Scottiſh intereſt William Bullock,
                    governor of the caſtle of Coupar: after which, having expelled the enemy from
                    every poſt to the northward of the Forth, he employed himſelf in ſettling the
                    affairs of the nation as well as he could.</p>
                <p>In 1341, the caſtle of Edinburgh was ſurpriſed by a device of Sir William
                    Bullock. According to his appointment, one Walter Currie of Dundee privately
                    received into his ſhip the knight of Liddeſdale, with William Fraſer, Joachim of
                    Kinbuck, and 200 reſolute men. Currie caſt anchor in Leith road, pretending to
                    be an Engliſh ſhipmaſter, who had a cargo of wine and proviſions, with which he
                    propoſed to furniſh the commander of the caſtle. His barrels and hampers were
                    brought to the caſtle-gate, and ſuddenly thrown down in such a manner as to
                    obſtruct the ſhutting of it. Currie and his men then flew the centinels; and the
                    knight of Liddeſdale, with a party who lurked in the neighbourhood, ruffled in,
                    overpowered the garriſon, and made themſelves maſters of the place.—On the 4th
                    of March this year, the king and queen arrived from France, and landed at
                    Inverbervie in Kincardineſhire.</p>
                <p>In 1342, Sir Alexander Ramsay took the ſtrong fortreſs of Roxburgh; for which
                    important ſervice the king beſtowed on him the charge of sheriff of Teviotdale,
                        at<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0777.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0771"/> that
                    time held by William Douglas knight of Liddeſdale. The king’s liberality proved
                    fatal to Ramſay: for from that time Douglas became his implacable and inveterate
                    enemy; and having, after a pretended reconciliation, unexpectedly ſurptiſed him
                    with three of his friends, he put theta inſtantly to death, carrying off Ramſay
                    himſelf to his caſtle of the Hermitage, where he cauſed him to be ſtarved to
                    death in a moſt barbarous manner. The unhappy man was confined in a room, over
                    which was an heap of wheat; a few grains of which were let fall every day
                    through a hole, not as many as would ſupport life, but as would protract it for
                    a time, and make him longer ſenſible of the agonies of hunger; and in this
                    miſerable ſituation he ſurvived 17 days. About the ſame time Sir William Bullock
                    was put to death by Douglas in a ſimilar manner; nor was King David at that time
                    in a capacity to punish ſuch atrocious cruelties committed by ſo powerful a
                    ſubject.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, David having raiſed a powerful army, prepared to take a ſevere
                    revenge of the Engliſh, from whom he had ſuffered ſo much. Edward was at that
                    time in France, but commanded Baliol to raiſe all the militia beyond the Trent:
                    which order, however, produced but little effect; ſo much was this mean-
                    ſpirited prince deſpiſed by the Engliſh. David invaded Northumberland without
                    opposition, and ravaged the country; but was obliged to raiſe the ſiege of
                    Newcaſtle, which was commanded by Sir John Nevil, an excellent officer. David,
                    exaſperated at this repulſe, entered the biſhopric of Durham, which he ravaged
                    in the moſt cruel manner. However, on the approach of Edward with a powerful
                    army, the Scots thought proper to retire; and a two years truce was agreed
                    upon.</p>
                <p>This pacification was but ſhort lived. In 1345 the Scots again prepared to invade
                    England, while Edward took all neceſſary meaſures for oppoſing them: however,
                    this year the Scots were ſucceſsful, ravaging Weſtmoreland, and burning ſeveral
                    towns. The year ended with a new truce between the two nations; and hoſtilities
                    were not renewed till 1346, when David entered England with an army of 50,000
                    men. His firſt exploit was the taking of the ſortreſs of Liddel, and maſſacring
                    all whom he found in it. The commander, Sir Waiter Selby, capitulated with a
                    Scots knight for his life; but the bargain being diſapproved of by David, he
                    ordered two of Selby’s ſons to be ſtrangled in his preſence, and then the
                    father’s head to be cut oft. From thence the Scots marched to Bancroft, which
                    they plundered; then paſſing into Northumberland, they pillaged the priory of
                    Hexham, but ſpared the town, that it might ſerve as a magazine. Three other
                    towns, Corbridge, Durham, and Darlington, were ſpared for the fame reaſon. In
                    his march to Durham, it is ſaid that he would have made the county a deſert, had
                    not ſome of the monks paid him a contribution of a thouſand pounds to ſpare
                    their eſtates: however, according to Knyghton, every Engliſhman who fell into
                    David’s hands was put to death, unleſs he could redeem his life by paying
                    threepence.</p>
                <p>To put a ſtop to the cruelties of this barbarous invader, the queen of England,
                    in her huſband’s abſence, aſſembled a powerful army, which was divided into four
                    bodies; the firſt commanded by Lord Henry Percy; the second by the archbiſhop of
                    York; the</p>
                <p>third by the biſhop of Lincoln, the lord Moubray, and Sir Thomas Rokeby; and the
                    fourth and principal division was headed by Edward Baliol.—The king of Scotland
                    headed a choſen battalion, compoſed of the flower of his nobility, and the
                    auxiliaries with which he had been ſupplied by France. The high ſteward of
                    Scotland headed the ſecond line, and the third was commanded by the earls of
                    Moray and Douglas. While the Engliſh were approaching, Lord Douglas and Sir
                    David Graham ſkirmiſhed with them, but were defeated with the loſs of 500 of
                    their men; which ſeemed an omen of the diſaſter that was about to enſue. The
                    general engagement began between the archers on both ſides; but the Engliſh
                    being much ſuperior in the uſe of the bow, the ſteward of Scotland advanced to
                    the relief of his countrymen. The Engliſh archers, unable to bear his attack,
                    fell back upon Lord Henry Percy’s diviſion, which was thus put in confuſion, and
                    would have been totally defeated, had not Baliol advanced to their relief with a
                    body of 4000 horſe. The ſteward was then obliged to retire; by which means the
                    flank of that divifion commanded by David, and which was then engaged with
                    another line of the Engliſh, was left expoſed to an attack. Baliol perceived the
                    advantage; and, without purſuing the ſteward, attacked the king’s diviſion,
                    which was immediately cut in pieces or diſperſed. David was left with about 80
                    noblemen and gentlemen, but ſtill maintained the fight with obſtinacy; nor would
                    he yield even when wounded in the head with an arrow, expecting every moment to
                    be relieved by the ſteward and that line of his army which was ſtill entire
                    under the Lords Moray and Douglas. At laſt finding himſelf totally overpowered,
                    he attempted to retreat, but was overtaken by a party under one John Copeland.
                    This captain, endeavouring to ſeize the king, had two of his teeth ſtruck out by
                    a blow of his gauntlet; but at laſt, finding it in vain to reſiſt, the king was
                    obliged to give up his ſword and ſurrender himſelf a priſoner. —After he was
                    taken, Baliol attacked and totally routed that diviſion of the Scottiſh army
                    which had hitherto remained entire under the Lords Moray and Douglas. In this
                    battle the Scots loſt a great number of their nobility, and 15,000 common
                    ſoldiers. Many perſons of the firſt diſtinction were alſo taken along with the
                    king; and had it not been that the eſcape of the Scots was favoured by the
                    avarice of the Engliſh ſoldiers, who neglected the purſuit in order to plunder,
                    ſcarce a single Scotſman would have returned.</p>
                <p>King David, after this unfortunate battle, was carried to the caſtle of
                    Bamborough, where he was kept with ſo much privacy, that for ſome time it was
                    not known where he was, or that he had been taken prisoner. As soon as the truth
                    was known, the queen of England demanded the royal priſoner from Copeland; but
                    the latter poiſitively refused to part with him even to the queen, unleſs ſhe
                    could produce an order to that purpoſe under Edward’s hand and ſeal. This
                    reſolute behaviour was reſented by the queen, and a complaint made to the king;
                    in conſequence of which Copeland was ſurhmoned to appear before Edward, after
                    having reſigned David to the cuſtody of Lord Nevil. The Engliſh monarch, at that
                    time in France, approved of all that he had done, rewarded him with 500 l. a
                    year, and ſent him back to England with the honour of<pb

                    David was then eſcorted by Copeland, attended, it is ſaid, by 20,000 men, from
                    the caſtle of Ogle in Northumberland, till the Lord Nevil, by indenture,
                    delivered him into the hands of Sir Thomas Rokeby ſheriff of Yorkſhire. In the
                    ſame pompous manner he was conducted all the way to London, which he entered on
                    a black courser. He was received in the capital with the greateſt ſolemnity by
                    the lord mayor and other magiſtrates, the city-companies under arms lining all
                    the ſtreets through which he paſſed, the houſes loaded with ſpectators, who
                    expreſſed a generous concern for his captivity. Being arrived at the Tower, he
                    was delivered, by indenture likewiſe, to the cuſtody of the conſtable, the Lord
                    John Darcy, on the 2d of January 1347.</p>
                <p>Baliol now, encouraged by the misfortune of his rival, made an effort once more
                    to eſtabliſh himſelf on the throne of Scotland; and before the end of the year
                    reduced the castles of Hermitage and Roxburgh, the foreſt of Ettric, the Merſe,
                    with the counties of Annandale, Teviotdale, and Tweeddale. The Scots continued
                    faithful to the cauſe of their king, notwithſtanding his misfortune, and choſe
                    the Steward for the guardian of the kingdom. He behaved with a prudence equal to
                    the high ſtation he filled: nevertheleſs the progreſs of Baliol was ſo rapid,
                    that it is ſcarcely probable he could have maintained his ground, had not Edward
                    again conſented to a truce; which, however, ſeems to have been ill observed on
                    the part of the Scots. In fact, though both Scots and Engliſh hiſtorians are
                    filent as to particulars, we find, that about the end of the year 1348, all
                    Scotland was recovered out of the hands of the Engliſh; excepting Berwick,
                    Roxburgh, Hermitage, and Lanric, which was part of Baliol’s hereditary eſtate,
                    and defended by him with an army. The Scots hiſtorians inform us, that the
                    Engliſh, in revenge for the damages done to their country by the breach of the
                    peace, proclaimed a tournament and other military exerciſes at Berwick, to which
                    they invited the Scots; but in their way thither the latter fell into an
                    ambuſcade, and were all cut in pieces.</p>
                <p>The years 1349 and 1350 were remarkable only for a dreadful plague which invaded
                    Scotland, after having ravaged the continent of Europe. According to Fordun,
                    one-third of the people of Scotland periſhed at this time. The patient’s fleſh
                    ſwelled exceedingly, and he died in two days illneſs; but the mortality chiefly
                    affected the middling and lower ranks of people. The ſame dreadful calamity
                    continued throughout the years 1351 and 1352; occaſioning a ceſſation of arms
                    not only in Scotland, but throughout all Europe.</p>
                <p>All this time King David remained a priſoner in England; for though ſeveral
                    treaties had been propoſed, they had hitherto come to nothing, becauſe the
                    Engliſh monarch inſiſted upon being indemnified for the ravages the Scots had
                    committed in his territories. At laſt it was agreed, that the king of Scotland
                    ſhould be immediately ſet at liberty, on paying 90,000 merks for his ranſom, by
                    equal proportions, within the ſpace of nine years: That 10,000 merks, being the
                    firſt proportion, ſhould be paid, at the feaſt of Candlemas next to come, the
                    second at Candlemas 1357, and ſo on till complete payment ſhould be made of the
                    whole: That, during the ſaid ſpace of nine years, there ſhould be a truce
                    between the two kingdoms: That so Scots gentlemen, of the beſt families in the
                    kingdom, ſhould remain in England as hoſtages and ſureties for the ſaid ſum; and
                    that, if any part thereof was not paid at the preciſe time appointed, then David
                    ſhould remain a priſoner in England till it was paid; or, if he was detained by
                    anyjuſt cauſe, that the lord high ſteward, the Lord Douglas, John of the Iſles,
                    and others of the higheſt rank, ſhould come and ſupply his place.</p>
                <p>Theſe terms were rejected by the Scots nobility; and, in 1355, war was
                    recommenced with England, at the inſtigation of France, who lent 40,000 crowns
                    to Scotland as a ſupply for defraying the expences.</p>
                <p>With this ſum the guardian, having raiſed an army, once more took the field; but
                    not before the Engliſh had deſtroyed the Lothians and Douglaſdale. A battle was
                    fought on Niſhit-moor: in which the Engliſh being drawn into an ambuſcade, were
                    totally defeated. The next attempt of the Scots was againſt the town of Berwick,
                    which they deſigned to ſurpriſe by an eſcalade. They met, however, with ſuch a
                    vigorous reliſtance, that many perſons of diſtinction were killed. However, the
                    attack proved ſucceſsful; but the acquisition was of no great importance, as the
                    caſtle ſtill held out. Edward, in the mean time, hearing of the loſs of the
                    town, hurried back from France to London. Here he ſtaid but three days, and
                    marched northward to raiſe the siege. He reached Durham on the 23d of December
                    1355, where he appointed all his military tenants to meet him on the 1st of
                    January 1356. On the 14th of the ſame month he arrived before Berwick, which was
                    inſtantly retaken; but the Scots were allowed to depart for their own country.
                    The reduction of this place produced an extraordinary effect: for Baliol now
                    perceiving that Edward meant not to eſtabliſh him on the throne of Scotland, but
                    to retain in his own poſſeſſion as many places of that country as he could, came
                    at laſt to the reſolution of giving up to the king of England the whole of
                    Scotland. This indeed was no more than a form, becauſe at that time he was not
                    poſſeſſed of the kingdom. However, the ceremony was performed at Roxburgh; and
                    Baliol preſented his crown and ſome earth and ſtones by way of inveſtiture.
                    Baliol in return was to have a revenue of 2000 pounds a- year; and as Edward was
                    at the head of an excellent army, he had little doubt of being able to force the
                    Scots to submit.</p>
                <p>The affairs of Scotland were now in a very critical ſituation; and it was
                    neceſſary to gain time. For this reaſon, Edward was amuſed with a negociation;
                    and to this he the more willingly liſtened, as he was at that time waiting for
                    his fleet, from which he had great expectations. A little time, however,
                    diſcovered the deceit. The Scots plainly told Edward, that they would die rather
                    than ſubmit to his demands ; and he, in return, threatened a most dreadful
                    revenge. His fleet in the mean time arrived in the Frith of Forth ; the mariners
                    deſtroyed and pillaged all that was within their reach, without ſparing even the
                    ſacred edifices, carrying off the ſtatues of the blessed virgin, loading the
                    monks with chains, and committing every thing in thoſe days called impiety and
                    ſacrilege. Edward had by this time marched as far as Haddington, but was obliged
                    to receive proviſions all the way from his fleet; for the Scots had deſolated
                    the country through which he passed. During his march his army was haraſſed,
                        and<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0779.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0773"/> his
                    foragers cut off, ſo that he was reduced to diſtreſs; and at laſt his fleet
                    being totally deſtroyed by a ſtorm, he was obliged to return to England without
                    accompliſhing any thing.</p>
                <p>In the mean time the prince of Wales, who had been left by his father to carry on
                    the war in France, defeated and took priſoner John king of France at the battle
                    of Poictiers. In this battle were 3000 Scots, who had gone over as auxiliaries
                    to the French monarch, and who ſuffered extremely. However, the ſucceſs of
                    Edward, inſtead of rendering him haughty, ſeemed to have a contrary effect; and,
                    by the mediation of Pope Innocent, a truce for two years was concluded with
                    France, in which the Scots were comprehended. During this interval, the ranſom
                    of the king of Scots was ſettled at 100,000 merks to be paid in ten years; for
                    which 20 hoſtages were to be given as formerly. In conſequence of this treaty,
                    David at laſt obtained his liberty in 1358; and Edward laid aſide all hopes of
                    ever ſubduing Scotland. As for Baliol, he was now ſunk in oblivion; and it is
                    not known what became of him, or when he died.</p>
                <p>David, though now reſtored to liberty, found himſelf greatly embarraſſed with the
                    payment of ſuch a large ſum as had been ſtipulated for his ranſom; the kingdom
                    of Scotland being then in a moſt miſerable and exhauſted ſituation. After
                    ſending his queen, and going into England himſelf, he could obtain no greater
                    favour than a reſpite of a few months for the payment of the ſecond moiety; ſo
                    that he was at laſt conſtrained to aſk aſſiſtance from France. This could
                    ſcarcely be expected in the diſtrefled ſituation of that kingdom; however,
                    it</p>
                <p>was at laſt agreed, that 50,000 marks ſhould be paid to Scotland, in case the
                    Scots would conſent to renew the war the following year. Neither party, however,
                    kept their word; and David, being ſtill greatly diſtreſsed about the remainder
                    of his ranſom, at laſt entered into a very extraordinary negociation with
                    Edward, by which he conſented that the king of England ſhould be his ſucceſſor
                    to the throne of Scotland. But this negociation was defeated through the
                    invincible hatred which the Scots bore to an Engliſh governor. David then, being
                    entirely unable to diſcharge the remainder of his ranſom, was obliged to enter
                    into a new treaty; by which the kingdom of Scotland became indebted to Edward
                    the ſum of 100,000 pounds Sterling, to be paid by equal proportions within the
                    ſpace of 25 years, during which there ſhould be a truce between the two
                    nations.</p>
                <p>From this time we meet with little more of any moment in the reign of King David.
                    After the death of his Queen Johanna, the ſiſter of Edward, he married a Scots
                    woman, of mean birth, named Margaret Logie; but by neither of his wives had he
                    any children. Queen Margaret he divorced, on what pretence is not known;
                    however, ſhe left the kingdom, and complained perſonally to the pope, who
                    treated her as David’s lawful wife, and enjoined her huſband to receive her as
                    ſuch under the moſt ſevere penalties. What effect theſe threats had on the king
                    is not known; but it is certain that Margaret never returned to Scotland; and,
                    on the 22d of February 1371, David himſelf died, leaving the kingdom to his
                    nephew Robert Stewart, the firſt of that family who ſat on the throne of
                        Scotland<note anchored="true" n="13" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                                rend="smallcaps">(K)</hi> Concerning the origin of the Stewart
                            family, we have the following account by the Scots hiſtorians. Fleance,
                            the ſon of the celebrated Banquo, after his father’s murder by Macbeth,
                            fled into Wales, where he had a ſon named <hi rend="italic">Walter,</hi>
                            by a princeſs of that country. After the reſtoration of Malcolm Canmore,
                            this Walter returned to Scotland, where he was promoted to the high
                            ſtewardſhip, a dignity held by ſervice, and which intitled the poſſeſſor
                            to all the privileges of a baron. Waiter was now diſtinguiſhed, from
                            this office, by the title of <hi rend="italic">Walter the Stewart,</hi>
                            which deſcended to his poſterity; and <hi rend="italic">Steward,</hi>
                            afterwards <hi rend="italic">Stewart,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                                >Stuart,</hi> became their ſurname.</p><p>On this ſubject Lord
                            Hailes has the following remarks. “Our hiſtorians have recorded the
                            achievements of Walter the Stewart of Scotland in the reign of Malcolm
                            III. He is ſaid to have been the father of Alan, and the grandfather of
                            that Walter who was indeed Stewart of Scotland in the reign of David I.
                            and Malcolm IV. It may perhaps be aſcribed to ſtrange prejudices, or to
                            a ſpirit of ſcepticiſm, when I declare, that hitherto I have ſeen no
                            evidence that ſuch a perſon as Walter Stewart of Scotland, in the reign
                            of Malcolm III. did ever exiſt.</p><p>“We are gravely told, ‘That Walter
                            the ſon of Fleance, the ſon of Banquo, Thane of Lochaber, having killed
                            a man at the court of Griffith, prince of Wales, fought refuge with
                            Edward the Confeſſor; and having killed another man at Edward’s court,
                            fought refuge with Alan the Red, earl of Brittany: That, on the Norman
                            invaſion, he came to England with the earl of Brittany, and ſignalized
                            himſelf at the battle of Haſtings in 1066: That the earl of Brittany, by
                            his firſt wife Emma, daughter of Siward earl of Northumberland, had an
                            only child Chriſtina; and that he bellowed her in marriage on the young
                            hero.” This is the ſtory which, after various improvements ſince the
                            days of Boece, has had the good fortune to obtain credit.</p><p>“That
                            Walter, before he had well attained to the age of manhood, ſhould have
                            ſlain two men in private quarrels, is a circumſtance improbable, yet
                            poſſible; and therefore I object not to it. But his alliance with the
                            earl of Brittany cannot be ſo eaſily admitted.</p><p>“Alan, ſurnamed <hi
                                rend="italic">le Roux,</hi> a younger ſon of Eudo earl of Brittany,
                            was one of the gallant adventurers who came over with William the
                            Conqueror; <hi rend="italic">he had neither territories nor court.</hi>
                            The hiſtorians of Brittany poſitively aſſert that he had no children.
                            Beſides, it is hard to ſay by what accident Alan <hi rend="italic">le
                                Roux</hi> ſhould have become acquainted with Emma the daughter of
                            Siward earl of Northumberland! I ſuppoſe that our hiſtorians invented
                            this alliance, in order to ſtrengthen the connection between Walter the
                            Stewart and Malcom III.</p><p>"According to another account, the

                            Earl Goſpatrick, and in another charter granted by his ſon Waldeve Earl
                            of March, at Dunbar. In them Alden, or Aldan Dapifer, is mentioned as a
                            witneſs; that is, ſay our antiquaries, <hi rend="italic">Allan, the

                            the ſame; upon what authority I know not. The Alden mentioned in the two
                            charters ſeems to have been the ſtewart of Earl Goſpatrick, and oſ Earl
                            Waldeve, not the ſtewart of Scotland.</p><p>To the charter by Earl
                            Goſpatrick, there are eight witneſſes: ‘Andrew the arch-deacon; Adam his

                    and to take away for the future all diſputes concerning the ſucceſſion, a
                    particular act was framed, by which the kingdom was ſecured to Robert and his
                    heirs.</p>
                <p>The new king being thus eſtabliſhed on the throne, endeavoured to renew the war
                    with the Engliſh, in order to recover from them the town of Berwick, and ſome
                    other places on the borders. In this, however, he failed; and as 56,000 pounds
                    of David’s ranſom ſtill remained unpaid, Robert bound himſelf to diſcharge it at
                    the rate of 4000 marks every midſummer. He then propoſed an alliance with
                    France; but the terms demanded by that kingdom being, that Scotland ſhould be
                    obliged to make war with England whenever France ſhould require it, Robert could
                    not by any means be induced to conſent to ſuch a requiſition, which would have
                    obliged him to break through the most ſolemn treaties, whenever the king of
                    France ſhould think proper to break with England. A new treaty,</p>
                <p>therefore, was entered into, by which it was provided, that neither Scotland nor
                    France ſhould be obliged to make war with England; and by another clauſe, that
                    the diſpenſation or authority even of the pope himſelf ſhould never free the
                    kings or kingdoms of France and Scotland from the obligations they lay under to
                    aſſiſt one another, as often as required, in oppoſition to the kingdom of
                    England. In cafe of a competition for the crown of Scotland, the king of France
                    and his heirs were to take care that no Engliſh influence was uſed; but that the
                    matter being by the greateſt and beſt part of the nation decided conformably to
                    the laws and eſtabliſhment of Scotland, he ſhould with all his power defend and
                    aſſiſt the perſon ſo eſtabliſhed. Lastly, it was agreed that no Frenchman ſhould

                    Scotſman againſt France.</p>
                <p>This laſt article occasioned a recal of all the Scots from the Engliſh armies,
                    which Edward looked upon to be a prelude to an invaſion. He accordingly iſſued

                    inhabitants of the borders, indeed, paid very little regard to the orders of
                    their reſpective ſovereigns; so that daily hoſtilities were committed by them
                    upon each other when there was peace between the ſovereigns. The inhabitants of
                    theſe countries had eſtabliſhed with one another certain conventions, which have
                    ſince been collected, and go by the name of the <hi rend="italic">Border
                        laws.</hi> The families of Douglas and Percy, whoſe eſtates lay contiguous
                    to one another, were at perpetual variance. It had been common for the borderers
                    of both kingdoms, during a truce, to frequent cach others fairs; and a ſervant
                    of the earl of March had been Killed in a fray at that of Roxburgh, which was
                    ſtill in the hands of the Engliſh. Juſtice for this murder was demanded from
                    lord Percy; but he flighted the cornplaint. On this the earl of March, with his
                    brother the earl of Moray, aſſembling their followers, entered the next fair
                    that was held in Roxburgh, plundered and burnt the town, and killed all the
                    English who fell into tlheir hands. The Engliſh borderers were ordered to lay
                    waste the lands of the earl of March; but, in their way thither, deſtroyed the
                    eſtate of Sir John Gordon, a man of great property in the ſouth of Scotland. Sir
                    John in his turn invaded England, from whence he drove off a large booty in
                    cattle, and a number of priſoners. In his retreat he was attacked by a body of
                    freſh troops under Sir John Liſburn, at a place called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Carαrn.</hi> An obſtinate encounter followed. The Scots were five times
                    repulſed; but at laſt they renewed the charge with such fury, that they made
                    Liſburn, his brother, and ſeveral other perſons of diſtinction, priſoners,
                    together with all their ſurviving ſoldiers. On this lord Percy with 7000 men
                    encamped at Duns, in the ſouth of Scotland; but was obliged to retire, probably
                    for want of ſubſiſtence for his army. In the mean time, Muſgrave, the governor
                    of Berwick, who had been ordered to join Percy with a detachment from the
                    garriſon, was on his march intercepted, defeated, and taken priſoner by Sir John
                    Gordon; after which the border war became general on both ſides. The issue of
                    theſe diſturbances is but little known; however, in 1377, we find them raging
                    with more violence than ever. The fair of Roxburgh was once more the ſcene of
                    action, and the town was again, burnt down by the Scots. Lord Percy, who was
                        now<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0782.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0776"/> earl
                    of Northumberland, reſolved to take ſignal vengeance. He ravaged the Scots
                    borders, particularly the earl of March’s eſtate, for three days, at the head of
                    10,000 men. Some time after this, the Scots inſurgents became powerful enough to
                    ſurpriſe Berwick; which, however, was quickly retaken by the Engliſh, who ſoon
                    after invaded Scotland. In this expedition, however, they ſucceeded ſo ill, that
                    Percy thought proper to deſiſt from his expedition. The Scots in the mean time
                    began hoſtilities by ſea, under one Mercer, an experienced ſailor; but he had
                    the misfortune to be taken priſoner by the Engliſh, with all his fleet. In 1379,
                    England was afflicted with a dreadful plague, of which the Scots took advantage
                    to invade the country. The Engliſh hiſtorians tell us that they behaved with the
                    utmoſt barbarity, killing and plundering the defenceleſs inhabitants without
                    mercy.</p>
                <p>This predatory war continued, generally to the diſadvantage of the Engliſh, till
                    the beginning of November 1380, when a truce was concluded, to continue for a
                    year; which, however, related only to the borders. This truce, like the others,
                    was but very indifferently obſerved; ſo that, in 1383, new negociations were ſet
                    on foot: but, in 1384, the war was renewed with greater fury than ever. In the
                    ſpring, the earls of March and Douglas took the castle of Lochmaben, and
                    intercepted a rich convoy which the Engliſh were sending to Roxburgh; burnt to
                    the ground the caſtle of Wark, and committed ſuch devaſtations in the north of
                    England, that ſeveral gentlemen offered to reſign their eſtates to King Richard,
                    becauſe they were not able to defend them againſt the Scots. The Duke of
                    Lancaſter entered Scotland at the head of an army; but the inhabitants had
                    removed every thing valuable, ſo that he marched on to Edinburgh without
                    accompliſhing any thing of conſequence. On his return, he was haraſſed by flying
                    parties of Scots, who deſtroyed a conſiderable number of his men. This year alſo
                    the French ſent a body of auxiliaries into Scotland. The earls of Northumberland
                    and Nottingham entered Scotland with an army of 10,000 horſe and 6000 archers;
                    but retired, after having committed ſome devaſtations in the ſouthern counties.
                    The Scots revenged themſelves by laying waſte all the northern part of England
                    to the gates of Newcaſtle. Berwick was taken by the Scots, and ſoon after
                    ſurrendered for the ſum of 2000 marks. A truce was then, as uſual, concluded;
                    but in the mean time king Robert was meditating a moſt ſevere blow againſt the
                    Engliſh.</p>
                <p>The Duke of Burgundy having come to the poſſeſſion of the eſtate of his
                    father-in-law the earl of Flanders, claimed the ſovereignty of the town of
                    Client; but they refuſed to ſubmit to him, and in this refuſal were protected by
                    king Richard II. of England. On this the duke of Burgundy propoſed to the French
                    court to invade England in concert with the Scots.— This being agreed to, a
                    fleet was fitted out at Sluys; on board of which John de Vienne, the French
                    admiral, embarked, carrying along with him 50,000 pounds in gold, which the duke
                    of Burgundy advanced in order to be diſtributed in Scotland, where the admiral
                    arrived ſafe with a conſiderable reinforcement, together with Supplies of all
                    kinds of military ſtores. Two thouſand auxiliaries, of whom 500 were
                    men-at-arms, arrived with this fleet; and 400 ſuits of complete armour were
                    Brought along with them, in order to be diſtributed among the braveſt of the
                    Scots.</p>
                <p>The Scots were for a ſhort time elated with the great attention which had been
                    paid them by the French king; but, in the mean time, the Flemings having
                    revolted, the French abandoned the Scots to ſuſtain the whole weight of the
                    Engliſh reſentment, that they themſelves might employ their arms in Flanders.
                    King Richard took the field with a more numerous army than had ever been
                    muſtered in England before. Hoſtilſties were begun by the Scots, who, according
                    to cuſtom, invaded the northern parts of England, and carried off a conſiderable
                    booty: however, in their retreat, they were in the utmoſt danger of being cut
                    off by the duke of Lancaſter, who had been ſent with an army to intercept them.
                    The Engliſh army proceeded northwards: but could accompliſh nothing, on account
                    of the country being deſolated, till they came to Edinburgh, which they laid in
                    aſhes. Being, however, inceſſantly haraſsed by parties of the enemy, they were
                    obliged to retreat.</p>
                <p>Nothing remarkable happened till the year 1378, when, after a ſhort truce, the
                    war was renewed with freſh fury. Northumberland and Weſtmoreland were ravaged by
                    the earls of Fife and Douglas, and Lord Nithſdale defeated a body of 3000
                    Engliſh; after which he formed the plan of invading Ireland, the inhabitants of
                    which had of late been very active againſt the Scots. In 1388, Douglas obtained
                    permiſſion to raiſe a body of forces for this invaſion; and having landed in
                    ſafety, defeated the Iriſh, plundered the town of Carlingford, and loaded
                    fifteen ſhips with the booty. From thence the Scots ſailed to the iſle of Man,
                    which in like manner was plundered and laid waſte; after which they returned
                    with their booty to Loch Rian in Scotland.</p>
                <p>Encouraged by this succeſs, Robert determined to proceed on a more enlarged plan.
                    Having aſſembled a parliament at Aberdeen, a double invaſion of England was
                    reſolved upon. Two armies were raiſed; the one, conſiſting of 25,000 men,
                    commanded by the earls of Mentieth and Fife, Douglas lord of Galloway, and
                    Alexander Lindſay; the other army, conſiſting of the like number, was commanded
                    by the earls of Douglas, March, Crawford, Moray, the lord high Conſtable of
                    Scotland, and other perſons of diſtinction. The former entered Cumberland, and
                    the latter Northumberland, both which countries they laid waſte, and both armies
                    were to meet within ten miles of Newcaſtle. The Engliſh were thrown into the
                    greateſt conſternation. Newcaſtle was defended by the earl of Northumberland,
                    whoſe age and infirmities rendered him incapable of taking the field; but his
                    place was abundantly ſupplied by his two ſons Henry and Ralph, the former of
                    whom is known in Engliſh hiſtory by the name of <hi rend="italic">Hotſpur.</hi>
                    The town was garriſoned by the flower of the Engliſh nobility and gentry, as
                    well as the inhabitants of the adjacent countries, who had fled thither for
                    refuge. Douglas ſelected 2000 foot and 300 horſemen out of the two armies, and
                    encamped on the north ſide of the town, with a view, according to the Scots
                    hiſtorians, of ſtorming it next day. In the mean time, he was challenged by
                    Hotſpur to fight him hand to hand, with ſharp ground ſpears, in ſight of both
                    armies. Douglas accepted the challenge, and Percy was unhorſed the firſt
                    encounter, and obliged to take refuge within the<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0783.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0777"/> portcullis or
                    gate of the town; from whence Douglas brought off his antagoniſt’s lance, with a
                    pennon affixed to it, and ſwore in his hearing that he would carry it into
                    Scotland. Next day Douglas attempted to ſtorm the town; but, being repulſed in
                    the attack, he decamped in the night. Percy, breathing furious revenge, purſued
                    and overtook the Scots at Otterburn. His arrival was quite unexpected, ſo that
                    the principal commanders of the Scottiſh army were ſitting down to ſupper
                    unarmed. The ſoldiers, however, were inſtantly prepared for battle; but in the
                    hurry neceſſarily attending a ſurpriſe of this kind, Douglas forgot to put on
                    his cuiraſs. Both leaders encouraged their men by the moſt animating ſpeeches;
                    and both parties waited for the riſe of the moon, which happened that night to
                    be unuſually bright. The battle being joined on the moon’s firſt appearance, the
                    Scots began to give ground; but, being rallied by Douglas, who fought with a
                    battle-ax, the Engliſh, though greatly ſuperior in number, were totally routed.
                    Twelve hundred were killed on the ſpot; and 100 perſons of diſtinction, among
                    whom were the two Percies, were made priſoners by Keith mariſchal of Scotland.
                    On the ſide of the Scots the greateſt loſs was that of the brave earl Douglas,
                    who was killed in conſequence of going to battle without his armour, as above
                    related. It was this ſingle combat between Douglas and Percy, and the ſubſequent
                    battle, which gave riſe to the celebrated ballad of Chevy Chace.</p>
                <p>In the mean time the biſhop of Durham was marching towards Newcaſtle with an army
                    of 10,000 men; but was informed by the runaways of Percy’s defeat, which
                    happened on the 21ſt of July 1388. In a council of war it was reſolved to purſue
                    the Scots, whom they hoped eaſily to vanquiſh, as being wearied with the battle
                    of the preceding day, and laden with plunder. The earl of Moray, who commanded
                    in chief, having called a conſultation of his officers, reſolved to venture a
                    battle. The priſoners were almoſt as numerous as the whole Scots army; however,
                    the generals required no more of them than their words of honour that they
                    ſhould continue inactive during the battle, and remain priſoners ſtill. This
                    condition being complied with, the Scots drew out their army for battle. — Their
                    rear was ſecured by marſhes, and their flanks by large trees which they had
                    felled. In ſhort, their appearance was ſo formidable, that the Engliſh, dreading
                    to encounter a reſolute enemy ſo ſtrongly ſecured, retired to Newcaſtle, leaving
                    the Scots at liberty to continue their march to their own country.</p>
                <p>Robert being now oppreſſed with age, ſo that he could no longer endure the
                    fatigues of government, the adminiſtration of affairs devolved upon his ſecond
                    ſon the earl of Fife; for his eldeſt ſon was by nature indolent, and beſides
                    lame by an unlucky blow he had received from a horſe. Early in the ſpring of
                    1389, he invaded England with ſucceſs: but the ſame year a truce was concluded,
                    to laſt from the 19th of June 1389 to the 16th of Auguſt 1392; in which the
                    allies of both crowns were included. This truce was violently oppoſed by the
                    nobility, who ſuſpected their king of being too much under French influence.
                    Upon this the court of France thought proper to ſend over ambaſſadors to
                    perſuade the nobility to comply; informing them, that in caſe of a refuſal, they
                    could expect no</p>
                <p>aſſiſtance either of men or money from the continent. With difficulty they
                    prevailed, and peace between England and Scotland was once more reſtored.
                    Scarce, however, was this truce finiſhed, when the peace of the nation was moſt
                    ſcandalouſly violated by Robert’s third ſon the earl of Buchan. This prince
                    having a quarrel with the biſhop of Murray, burnt down the fine cathedral of
                    Elgin, which has been called by hiſtorians the lanthorn and ornament of the
                    north of Scotland. The king for this crime cauſed his ſon to be impriſoned; and
                    a civil war would have been the conſequence, had it not been for the veneration
                    which the Scots retained for their old king. However, they did not long enjoy
                    their beloved monarch; for he died on the 19th of April 1390, in the 75th year
                    of his age, and the 19th of his reign.</p>
                <p>On the death of Robert II. the crown devolved upon his eldeſt ſon John; but the
                    name being thought unlucky in Scotland, he changed it for that of Robert, though
                    he was ſtill called by the commonalty <hi rend="italic">Robert John
                        Fernzier.</hi> He had been married to Annabella, the daughter of Sir John
                    Drummond, anceſtor to the noble family of Perth; and was crowned along with his
                    conſort at Scone, on the 13th of Auguſt 1390. He confirmed the truce which had
                    been entered into with England, and renewed the league with France; but the
                    beginning of his reign was diſturbed by the wars of the petty chieftains with
                    each other. Duncan Stewart, ſon to Alexander earl of Buchan, who had died in
                    priſon for burning the cathedral of Elgin, aſſembling his followers under
                    pretence of revenging his father’s death, laid waſte the county of Angus. Walter
                    Ogilvy, the ſheriff of Angus, attempting to repel the invaders, was killed, with
                    his brother and 60 of their followers. The king then gave a commiſſion to the
                    earl of Crawford to ſuppreſs them; which he ſoon did, and moſt of them were
                    either killed or executed. The followers of the earl of Buchan were compoſed of
                    the wildeſt Highlanders, diſtinguiſhed by the title of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Catterenes,</hi> which anſwers to that of banditti. That ſuch a race of
                    people exiſted is certain from the records of Scotland; but it is not eaſy to
                    determine how they obtained their ſubſiſtence, being void of the knowledge of
                    agriculture and of every civil art. There is ſome reaſon to believe that many of
                    them came from the Weſtern Iſles; and that they or their anceſtors had emigrated
                    from the eaſtern parts of Ireland. The lands they inhabited were never
                    cultivated till towards the middle of the last century; and, according to the
                    moſt authentic accounts, they lived entirely upon animal food.</p>
                <p>The earl of Crawford’s ſucceſs againſt the followers of Buchan encouraged Robert
                    to intruſt him with a commiſſion for ſubduing other inſurgents by whom the peace
                    of the country was diſturbed. The moſt remark of theſe were the <hi
                        rend="italic">Clan Chattan</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Clan Kay.</hi> As both
                    theſe tribes were numerous and brave, Crawford was not without apprehenſions
                    that they might unite againſt him as a common enemy, and defeat him if he
                    attempted to ſuppreſs them by force. He propoſed, therefore, that the two rival
                    clans ſhould each chooſe 30 men, to determine their differences by the ſword,
                    without being allowed the uſe of any other weapon. The king and his nobility
                    were to be ſpectators of the combat; the conquered clan were to be pardoned for
                    all their former offences, and the conquerors honoured<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0784.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0778"/> with the
                    royal favour. This propoſal was readily accepted by both parties, and the north
                    inch of Perth was to be the ſcene of action. But, upon muſtering the combatants,
                    it was found that one of them, belonging to the clan Chattan, had abſented
                    himſelf. It was propoſed to balance this difference by withdrawing one of the
                    combatants from the clan Kay; but not one of them could be prevailed on to
                    reſign his place. At laſt one Henry Wynd, a ſaddler, though no way connected
                    with either party, offered to ſupply the place of him that was abſent, on
                    condition of his receiving a French crown of gold (about 7 s. 6 d. of our
                    money); which was immediately paid him. The combat then began with incredible
                    fury; but at laſt, through the superior valour and ſkill of Henry Wynd, victory
                    declared in favour of the clan Chattan. Only ten of the conquerors, beſides
                    Wynd, were left alive; and all of them deſperately wounded. Of the clan Kay only
                    one remained; and he having received no hurt eſcaped by ſwimming acroſs the
                    Tay.</p>
                <p>While theſe internal broils were going on, the truce which had lately been
                    concluded with England was ſo ill obſerved, that it became neceſſary to enter
                    into freſh negociations. Theſe, like others which had taken place before, had
                    very little effect. The borderers on both ſides had been ſo accuſtomed to ravage
                    and plunder, that they could not live in quiet. King Robert alſo was thought to
                    be too much attached to the king of England. He had introduced the new title of
                        <hi rend="italic">duke,</hi> which he beſtowed firſt on the prince royal;
                    but making an offer of that honour to one of the heads of the Douglas family, it
                    was rejected with diſdain. That powerful family had never loſt fight of an
                    ancient claim they had upon the caſtle of Roxburgh, which was ſtill in the
                    poſſeſſion of the Engliſh; and this year the ſon of the earl of Douglas, Sir
                    William Stewart, and others, broke down the bridge of Roxburgh, plundered the
                    town, and deſtroyed the forage and corn there and in the neighbouring country.
                    The Engliſh applied for ſatisfaction; but obtained none, as the confuſion which
                    involved the kingdom by the depoſition of Richard II. and the acceſſion of Henry
                    IV. prevented them from having recourſe to arms, the only argument to which the
                    Scots patriots in thoſe days would liſten.</p>
                <p>No ſooner was the cataſtrophe of Richard known in Scotland, than they reſolved to
                    avail themſelves of it; and invading the north parts of England, demoliſhed the
                    caſtle of Wark, and laid the neighbouring country under contribution. The
                    ſituation of Henry’s affairs did not admit of his reſenting this inſult. He
                    contented himself with nominating his brother the earl of Weſtmoreland, to treat
                    with the Scots about a truce or peace; or, if that could not be obtained, to
                    make a mutual agreement, that the towns of Dumfries in Scotland, and Penrith in
                    England, ſhould be free from hoſtilities during the ar. To this propoſal the
                    Scots paid no regard; and being encouraged by the court of France, who relented
                    the depoſition of Richard, they renewed their ravages in England. In 1400, the
                    king of England called a parliament, in order to conſult on the moſt proper
                    means of repelling the Scottiſh invaſions; and in this he was greatly aſſiſted
                    by the diviſions of the Scots among themſelves. The duke of Rotheſay, the
                    heir-</p>
                <p>apparent of the crown, was now grown up to man’s eſtate, and it was thought
                    proper to provide a ſuitable conſort for him. The king is ſaid to have
                    ſcandalouſly put up his ſon’s marriage at auction, and offered him to the lady
                    whoſe father could give him the higheſt price. The earl of March was the higheſt
                    bidder; and advanced a considerable ſum in ready money, on condition that his
                    daughter ſhould become the royal bride.— This ſordid match was oppoſed by
                    Douglas, who propoſed his own daughter the lady Margery. So degenerate was the
                    court of Scotland at this time, that neither the king nor the duke of Rotheſay
                    oppoſed this propoſal of a new match, becauſe it was to be purchaſed with a
                    freſh ſum; and they even refuſed to indemnify the earl of March for the money he
                    had already advanced.</p>
                <p>As the duke of Albany ſided with Douglas, a council of the nobility was privately
                    aſſembled, which annulled the contract of the lady Elizabeth Dunbar, the earl of
                    March’s daughter, in favour of the lady Margery, daughter to the earl of
                    Douglas; but without taking any meaſures for repaying the money to the earl of
                    March. The continuator of Fordun informs us, that the earl of Douglas paid a
                    larger ſum for his daughter’s fortune than that which had been advanced by the
                    earl of March, and that the earl of Douglas’s daughter was married to the duke
                    of Rotheſay: that, before the marriage was celebrated, March demanded that the
                    money he had advanced ſhould be reimburſed; but receiving an unſatisfactory
                    anſwer, he declared, that as the king had not fulfilled his bargain, he would
                    bring unexpected calamities upon the country. Accordingly he fled into England,
                    leaving his caſtle of Dunbar to the cuſtody of his nephew Robert Maitland, who
                    ſoon after put it into the hands of the earl of Douglas, called in hiſtory <hi
                        rend="italic">Archibald the Grim,</hi> from the ſternneſs of his viſage.</p>
                <p>As ſoon as Robert heard of the revolt of the earl of March, he ſent ambaſſadors
                    demanding back his ſubject; but the requeſt was diſregarded. On the other hand,
                    the earl of March demanded repoſſeſſion of the caſtle of Dunbar, pleading, that
                    he had committed no act of treaſon, but had come to England under a ſafe conduct
                    from king Henry, on purpoſe to negociate his private affairs: but this requeſt
                    was diſregarded; upon which he ſent for all his family and followers to England,
                    where they joined him in great numbers. This produced a war between the two
                    kingdoms. The earl of March, with Henry Percy ſurnamed <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hotspur,</hi> invaded Scotland, penetrating as far as Haddington, and
                    carrying off great numbers of the inhabitants into captivity. From thence they
                    went to Peebles, and then to Linton, ravaging the country all the way as they
                    paſſed along. They next beſieged the caſtle of Hales, and took ſeveral of the
                    neighbouring forts; but Archibald the Grim, or rather his ſon, having raiſed an
                    army againſt them, they were ſtruck with terror, and fled to Berwick, to the
                    gates of which they were purſued by the Scots. At this time the Scottiſh
                    admiral, Sir Robert Logan, was at ſea with a ſquadron; but miſcarried in an
                    attempt he made upon ſome Engliſh ſhips of war that protected their fleet when
                    fiſhing upon the coaſt of Scotland. After this the Engliſh plundered the Orkney
                    islands; which, though belong-<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0785.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0779"/> ing to the crown of Norway, were at that time
                    governed, or rather farmed, by Sinclair the Scots earl of Orkney and
                    Caithneſs.</p>
                <p>All this time the earl of March continued under the protection of the king of
                    England. He had received repeated invitations to return to his allegiance: but
                    all of them being rejected, he was proclaimed a traitor ; and the Scottiſh
                    governor made a formal demand of him from king Henry. With this the latter not
                    only refuſed to comply, but renewed his league with the lord of the iſles. He
                    pretended alſo, that at this time he had intercepted ſome letters from the
                    Scottiſh regency, which called him “a traitor in the higheſt degree;” and he
                    alleged this as a reaſon why he protected not only the earl of March but the
                    lord of the Iſles.</p>
                <p>On the 25th of July 1400, the earl of March renounced his homage, fealty, and
                    ſervice, to the king of Scotland, and transferred them to Henry by a formal
                    indenture. For this the earl was rewarded with a penſion of 500 merks Sterling,
                    and the manor of Clipeſtone in Sherwood foreſt. Henry now began to revive the
                    claim of homage from the kings of Scotland, and even to meditate the conqueſt of
                    the kingdom. He had indeed many reaſons to hope for ſucceſs; the principal of
                    which were, the weakneſs of the Scottiſh government, the divided ſtate of the
                    royal family, and the diſſenſions among the chief nobility. For this purpoſe he
                    made great preparations both by ſea and land; but before he ſet out on his
                    journey, he received a letter from the duke of Rotheſay, full of reproaches on
                    account of the preſumptuous letters which Henry had addreſſed to Robert and his
                    nobility. The letter was addreſſed by the duke to his adverſary of England, as
                    the Scots had not yet recognized the title of Henry to the crown of England.
                    Towards the end of it the duke, according to the cuſtom of the times, deſired
                    Henry, in order to avoid the effuſion of Chriſtian blood, to fight him in perſon
                    with two, three, or an hundred noblemen on a ſide. But this challenge produced
                    no other anſwer from Henry, than that “he was ſurpriſed that the duke of
                    Rotheſay ſhould conſider noble blood as not being <hi rend="italic"
                        >Christian,</hi> ſince he deſired the effuſion of the one, and not of the
                    other.” Henry arrived at Leith on the very day in which he had appointed the
                    Scottiſh nobility to meet him and pay their homage, and conclude a peace between
                    the two crowns. In all probability, he expected to have been joined by great
                    numbers of the diſcontented Scots; and he flattered the Engliſh with a promiſe
                    of railing the power and glory of their country to a higher pitch than it had
                    ever known. Under this pretext, he ſeized upon the sum of 350,000 pounds in
                    ready money, beſides as much in plate and jewels, which had been left by Richard
                    in the royal treaſury. He railed alſo vaſt contributions on the clergy and
                    nobility, and likewiſe on the principal towns and cities. At laſt, finding that
                    neither his vaſt preparations, nor the intereſt of the earl of March, had
                    brought any of the Scots to his ſtandard, he formed the ſiege of Edinburgh
                    caſtle, which was defended by the duke of Rotheſay, and, as ſome ſay, by the
                    earl of Douglas. The duke of Albany, brother to king Robert, was then in the
                    field with an army, and ſent a letter to king Henry, promiſing, that if he would
                    remain where he was for ſix days, he would give</p>
                <p>him battle, and force him to raiſe the ſiege, or loſe his life. When this was
                    written, the duke was at Caldermuir; and Henry was ſo much pleaſed with the
                    letter, that he preſented the herald who delivered it with his upper garment,
                    and a chain of gold; promiſing, on his royal word, that he would remain where he
                    was until the appointed day. On this occaſion, however, the duke forfeited his
                    honour; for he ſuſſered ſix days to elapſe without making any attempt on the
                    Engliſh army.</p>
                <p>Henry, in the mean time, puſhed on the ſiege of Edinburgh caſtle; but met with
                    ſuch a vigorous reſiſtance from the duke of Rotheſay, that the hopes of reducing
                    it were but ſmall. At the ſame time he was informed that the Welſh were on the
                    point of rebellion under the famous chieftain named <hi rend="italic">Owen
                        Glendower.</hi> He knew alſo that many of the Engliſh were highly
                    diſſatisfied with his title to the crown; and that he owed his peaceable
                    poſſeſſion of it to the moderation of the earl of March, who was the real heir
                    to the unfortunate Richard, but a nobleman of no ambition. For theſe reaſons he
                    concluded it belt to raiſe the ſiege of Edinburgh caſtle, and to return to
                    England. He then agreed to a truce for ſix weeks, but which was afterwards
                    prolonged, probably for a year, by the commiſſioners of the two crowns, who met
                    at Kelſo.</p>
                <p>In 1401, Scotland ſuffered a great loſs by the death of Walter Trail, the
                    archbiſhop of St Andrew’s, a moſt exemplary patriot, and a perſon of great
                    influence. Archibald Douglas the Grim had died ſome time before, and his loſs
                    was now ſeverely felt; for the king himſelf, naturally feeble, and now quite
                    diſabled by his age and infirmities, was ſequeſtered from the world in ſuch a
                    manner, that we know not even the place of his residence during the laſt
                    invaſion of Scotland by the Engliſh. This year alſo queen Anabella died, ſo that
                    none remained who might be able to heal thoſe diviſions which prevailed among
                    the royal family. Robert duke of Albany, a man of great ambition, was an enemy
                    to the duke of Rotheſay, the heir-apparent to the crown; and endeavoured, for
                    obvious reaſons, to impreſs his father with a bad opinion of him. This prince,
                    however, appears to have been chargeable with no miſdemeanour of any
                    conſequence, excepting his having debauched, under promiſe of marriage, the
                    daughter of William Lindſay of Roſſy. But this is not ſupported by any credible
                    evidence; and, though it had been true, could never juſtify the horrid treatment
                    he met with, and which we are now about to relate.</p>
                <p>One Ramorgny, a man of the vileſt principles, but an attendant on the duke of
                    Rotheſay, had won his confidence; and, perceiving how much he relented the
                    conduct of his uncle the duke of Albany, had the villany to ſuggeſt to the
                    prince the diſpatching him by aſſaſſination The prince rejected this infamous
                    propoſal with ſuch horror and diſpleaſure, that the villain, being afraid he
                    would diſcloſe it to the duke of Albany, informed the latter, under the ſeal of
                    the moſt inviolable ſecrecy, that the prince intended to murder him; upon which
                    the duke, and William Lindſay of Roſſy his aſſociate in the treaſon, reſolved
                    upon the prince’s death. By practiſing upon the doating king, Lindſay and
                    Ramorgny obtained a writ directed to the duke of Albany, impowering him to
                    arreſt his ſon, and to keep him under reſtraint, in order for his amendment. The
                        ſame<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0786.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0780"/>
                    traitors had previouſly poſſeſſed the prince with an apprehenſion that his life
                    was in danger, and had persuaded him to ſeize the caſtle of St Andrew’s, and to
                    keep poſſeſſion of it during the vacancy of that ſee. Robert had nominated one
                    oſ his baſtard brethren, who was then deacon of St Andrew’s, to that biſhopric:
                    but being a perſon no way fitted for ſuch a dignity, he declined the honour, and
                    the chapter refuſed to elect any other during his lifetime; ſo that the prince
                    had a proſpect of poſſeſſing the caſtle for ſome time. He was riding thither
                    with a ſmall attendance, when he was arreſted between the towns of Nidi and
                    Stratirum (according to the continuator of Fordun), and hurried to the very
                    caſtle of which he was preparing to take poſſeſſion.</p>
                <p>The duke of Albany, and the earl of Douglas, who was likewiſe the prince’s enemy,
                    were then at Culroſs, waiting the event of their deteſtable conſpiracy; of which
                    they were no ſooner informed, than they ordered a ſtrong body of ruffians to
                    carry the royal captive from the caſtle of St Andrew’s; which they did, after
                    clothing him in a ruſſet cloak, mounting him on a very ſorry horſe, and
                    committing him to the cuſtody of two execrable wretches, John Selkirk and John
                    Wright, who were ordered by the duke of Albany to ſtarve him to death. According
                    to Buchanan, his late was for ſome time prolonged by the compaſſion of one of
                    his keeper’s daughters, who thruſt thin oat cakes through the chinks of his
                    priſon walls, and by a woman who, being a wet nurſe, found means to convey part
                    of her milk to him through a ſmall tube. Both theſe charitable females were
                    detected, and put to death; the young lady’s inhuman father being himſelf the
                    proſecutor. The prince himſelf died a few days after, on Eaſter-eve, his hunger
                    having impelled him to devour part of his own fleſh.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, Robert, being yet ignorant of the murder of his ſon, had
                    renewed, or rather conſented to renew, hoſtilities with England. On the
                    expiration of the truce, Henry had ſent a commiſſion to the earls of
                    Northumberland and Weſtmoreland, to offer the Scots any terms they could
                    reaſonably deſire; but every offer of this kind being rejected, there was a
                    neceſſity for renewing hoſtilities. The earl of March had received another
                    penſion from Henry, on condition of his keeping on foot a certain number of
                    light troops to act againſt the Scots. This had been done; and ſo effectually
                    did theſe now annoy their enemies, that the earl of Douglas was obliged to take
                    the field againſt them. By dividing his men into ſmall parties, he repreſſed the
                    depredations of theſe invaders; and Thomas Haliburton, the commander of one of
                    the Scottiſh parties, made incurſions into England as far as Bamborough, from
                    whence he returned with a conſiderable booty. This encouraged another chieftain,
                    Patrick Hepburn, to make a ſimilar attempt: but being elated with his ſucceſs,
                    he remained too long in the enemy’s country; ſo that the earl of March had time
                    to ſend a detachment to intercept him on his return. This produced a deſperate
                    encounter, in which Hepburn was killed; the flower of the youth of Lothian, who
                    had attended in this expedition, were cut off, and ſcarce a ſingle Scotſman
                    remained unwounded.</p>
                <p>On the news of this diſaſter, the earl of Douglas applied to the duke of Albany
                    for aſſiſtance. He was immediately furniſhed with a conſiderable army, according
                    to ſome, conſiſting of 10,000; according to others of 13,000; and according to
                    the Engliſh hiſtorians, of 20,000 men. Murdoc, the ſon of the duke, attended the
                    earl on this expedition, as did alſo the earls of Moray, Angus, Orkney, and many
                    others of the chief nobility, with 80 knights. The Scots on this occaſion
                    conducted themſelves with the ſame imprudence they had done before. Having
                    penetrated too far into the country, they were intercepted by the Engliſh on
                    their return, and obliged to engage at a place called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Homeldon,</hi> under great diſadvantages. The conſequence was, that they
                    were utterly defeated, and almoſt the whole army either killed or taken.</p>
                <p>Henry Hotſpur, to whom this victory was chiefly owing, reſolving to purſue the
                    advantage he had gained, entered the ſouthern parts of the kingdom, and laid
                    ſiege to a caſtle called <hi rend="italic">Cocklawys,</hi> on the borders of
                    Teviotdale. The caſtle was for ſome time bravely defended: but at laſt the
                    governor entered into a treaty, by which it was agreed to deliver up the caſtle,
                    in caſe it was not relieved by the king or governor in ſix weeks; during which
                    time no additional fortifications were to be made. But while the Engliſh were
                    retiring, one of Percy’s ſoldiers pretended that the Scots had broke the
                    capitulation, by introducing a mattock into the place. The governor, hearing of
                    this charge, offered to fight any Engliſhman who ſhould engage to make it good.
                    A champion was accordingly ſingled out, but was defeated by the Scotſman; and
                    the Engliſh army retired according to agreement. The matter then being debated
                    in the Scottiſh council, it was reſolved to ſend relief to the caſtle.
                    Accordingly the duke of Albany, with a powerful army, ſet out for the place; but
                    before he came there, certain news were received of the defeat and death of
                    Hotſpur, at Shrewſhury, as related under the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >England,</hi> n⁰ 182.</p>
                <p>In the year 1404, king Henry, exceedingly deſirous of a peace with Scotland,
                    renewed his negociations for that purpoſe. Theſe, however, not being attended
                    with ſucceſs, hoſtilities were ſtill continued, but without any remarkable
                    tranſaction on either side. In the mean time, king Robert was informed of the
                    miſerable fate of his eldeſt ſon the duke of Rotheſay; but was unable to reſent
                    it by executing juſtice on ſuch a powerful murderer. After giving himſelf up to
                    grief, therefore, for ſome time, he reſolved to provide for the ſafety of his
                    ſecond ſon James, by ſending him into France. This ſcheme was not communicated
                    to the duke of Albany; and the young prince took flipping with all imaginable
                    ſecrecy at the Baſs, under the care of the earl of Orkney. On his voyage he was
                    taken by an Engliſh privateer off Flamborough-head, and brought before Henry.
                    The Engliſh monarch having examined the attendants of the prince, they told him
                    that they were carrying the prince to France for his education. "I underſtand
                    the French tongue (replied Henry), and your countrymen ought to have been kind
                    enough to have truſted me with their prince’s education.” He then committed the
                    prince and his attendants cloſe priſoners to the tower of London. The news of
                    this diſaſter arrived at the caſtle of Rotheſay in the iſle of Bute (the place
                    of Robert’s reſidence) while the king was at ſupper. The news threw him into
                    ſuch an agony of grief, that he died in three<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0787.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0781"/> days, the
                    29th of March 1405, after having reigned near 15 years.</p>
                <p>By the death of Robert, and the captivity of the prince, all the power devolved
                    upon the duke of Albany, who was appointed regent by a convention of the ſtates
                    aſſembled at Scone. The allegiance of the people, however, to their captive
                    prince could not be ſhaken; ſo that the regent was obliged to raiſe an army for
                    the purpoſe of reſcuing him. Henry ſummoned all his military tenants, and made
                    great preparations: but, having agreed to treat of a final peace with Ireland
                    and the lord of the Iſles, the regent laid hold oſ this as a pretence for
                    entering into a new negociation with the Engliſh monarch; and a truce was
                    concluded for a year, during which time all differences were to be ſettled. In
                    conſequence of this agreement, Rotheſay, king at arms, was appointed
                    comrniſſary-general for the king and kingdom of Scotland; and in that quality
                    repaired to the court of England. At the time when the prince of Scotland was
                    taken, it ſeems that there had been a truce, however ill obſerved on both ſides,
                    ſubſiſting between the two nations. Rotheſay produced the record of this truce,
                    which provided that the Scots ſhould have a free navigation; and in conſequence
                    of this, he demanded juſtice of the captain and crew of the privateer who had
                    taken the prince. Henry ordered the matter to be inquired into: but the English
                    brought their complaints as well as the Scots; and the claims of both were ſo
                    intricate, that the examination fell to the ground, but at the ſame time the
                    truce was prolonged.</p>
                <p>In the end of the year 1409, or the beginning of 1410, the war was renewed with
                    England, and Flenry prepared to ſtrike a fatal blow which he had long meditated
                    againſt Scotland. He had, as we have ſeen, entered into a league with the lord
                    of the Iſles, where a conſiderable revolution then happened. Walter Leſley had
                    ſucceeded to the eſtate and honours of the earl of Roſs, in right of his wife,
                    who was the heir. By that marriage, he had a ſon named <hi rend="italic"
                        >Alexander,</hi> who ſucceeded him; and a daughter, Margaret, who was
                    married to the lord of the Iſles. This Alexander had married one of the regent’s
                    daughters; and dying young, he left behind him an only daughter, Euphane, who
                    was deformed, and become a nun at North Berwick. Her grandfather, the regent,
                    procured from her a reſignation of the earldom of Roſs, to which ſhe was
                    undoubted heir, in favour oſ John earl oſ Buchan, but in prejudice of Donald
                    lord of the Iſles, who was the ſon of Margaret, ſifter to the earl Alexander,
                    and conſequently the neareſt heir to the eſtate after the nun. Donald applied
                    for redreſs; but his ſuit being rejected, he, with his brother John, fled into
                    England, where he was moſt graciouſly received by king Henry. According to the
                    inſtructions given him by the Engliſh monarch, Donald returned to his own
                    dominions in the Iſles, where he raiſed an army, and paſſing over into
                    Roſsſhire, violently ſeized on the eſtate in diſpute. In a ſhort time he found
                    himſelf at the head of 10,000 Highlanders; with whom he marched into the
                    province of Moray, and from thence to Strathbogie and Garioch, which he laid
                    under contribution. Advancing towards Aberdeen, with a view to pay his troops
                    with the plunder of that city, which was then a place of conſiderable trade, he
                    was met by the earl of Marr, whom the re</p>
                <p>gent had employed to command againſt him, at a village called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Harlaw,</hi> in the neighbourhood of Aberdeen. A fierce engagement enſued,
                    in which great numbers were killed on both ſides, and the victory remained
                    uncertain: but Donald, finding himſelf in the midſt oſ an enemy’s country, where
                    he could raiſe no recruits, began to retreat next day; and the ſhattered ſtate
                    of the royal army preventing him from being purſued, he eſcaped to his own
                    dominions, where in a ſhort time he ſubmitted, and ſwore allegiance to the crown
                    of Scotland.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, Henry continued the war with Scotland, and refuſed to renew the
                    truce, though frequently ſolicited by the Scots. He had now, however, ſuſtained
                    a great loſs by the defection of the earl of March, who had gone over to the
                    Scots, though the hiſtorians have not informed us of his quarrel with the
                    Engliſh monarch. On his return to Scotland, he had been fully reconciled to the
                    Douglas family, and now ſtrove to diſtinguiſh himſelf in the cauſe of his
                    country. This, with the countenance which was ſhown the Scots by the court of
                    France, a bull publiſhed by the pope in their favour, and the vigorous behaviour
                    of the regent himſelf, contributed to reduce Henry to reaſon; and we hear of no
                    more hoſtilities between the two nations till after the death of the Engliſh
                    monarch, which happened in the year 1413.</p>
                <p>In 1415, the truce being either broken or expired, the Scots made great
                    preparations for beſieging Berwick. The undertaking, however, came to nothing;
                    all that was done during the campaign being the burning of Penrith by the Scots,
                    and of Dumfries by the Engliſh. Next year a truce was agreed upon, and a treaty
                    entered into for the ranſom of King James; which was ſo far advanced, that the
                    Engliſh king agreed to his viſiting Scotland, provided he engaged to forfeit
                    100,000 pounds Sterling in caſe of his failure to return by a certain day. For
                    reaſons now unknown, this, treaty was broken off, and vaſt preparations were
                    made for a new invaſion of Scotland; which, however, was executed with ſo little
                    fucceſs, that it became known among the common people of Scotland by the name of
                    the <hi rend="italic">ſule raid,</hi> or the fooliſh expedition.</p>
                <p>In 1420, died Robert duke of Albany, regent of Scotland, at the age of 80; and
                    ſuch was the veneration which the Scots had for his memory, that his poſt of
                    regent was conferred upon his eldeſt ſon Murdoch, though a perſon no way
                    qualified for that ſtation.— The war with England was now diſcontinued; but in
                    France Henry met with the greateſt oppoſition from the Scots auxiliaries,
                    inſomuch, that at laſt he proclaimed all the Scots in the ſervice of the Dauphin
                    to be rebels againſt their lawful ſovereign, and threatened to treat them as
                    ſuch wherever he found them. It was not long before he had an opportunity of
                    putting this menace in execution; for the town and caſtle of Melun being obliged
                    through famine to capitulate, one of the articles of capitulation was, that all
                    the Engliſh and Scots in the place ſhould be reſigned to the abſolute diſpoſal
                    of the king of England; and, in conſequence of his reſolution above-mentioned,
                    cauſed twenty Scots ſoldiers who were found in the place to be hanged as
                    traitors. In 1421, Henry returned to England, and with him James the Scots king.
                    On his<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0788.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0782"/> arrival
                    there, he was informed that the Scots, under the carl of Douglas, had made an
                    irruption into England, where they had burned Newark, but had been forced to
                    return to their own country by a peſtilence, though a new invaſion was daily
                    expected. Inſtead of reſenting this inſult, Henry invited the earl of Douglas to
                    a conference at York; in which the latter agreed to ſerve him during life, by
                    ſea and land, abroad or at home, againſt all living, except his own liege-lord
                    the king of Scotland, with 200 foot and as many horſe, at his own charges; the
                    king of England, in the mean time, allowing an annual revenue of 2001. for
                    paying his expence in going to the army by ſea or land.</p>
                <p>At the ſame time, a new negociation was ſet on foot for the ranſom of king James;
                    but he did not obtain his liberty till the year 1424. Henry V. was then dead;
                    and none of his generals being able to ſupply his place, the Engliſh power in
                    France began to decline. They then became ſenſible how neceſſary it was to be at
                    peace with Scotland, in order to detach ſuch a formidable ally from the French
                    intereſt. James was now highly careſſed, and at his own liberty, within certain
                    bounds. The Engliſh even conſulted him about the manner of conducting the treaty
                    for his ranſom; and one Dougal Drummond, a prieſt, was ſent with a ſafe conduct
                    for the biſhop of Glaſgow, chancellor of Scotland, Dunbar earl of March, John
                    Montgomery of Ardroſſan, Sir Patrick Dunbar of Bele, Sir Robert Lawder of
                    Edrington, Sir William Borthwic of Borthwic, and Sir John Forreſter of
                    Corſtorphin, to have an interview, at Pomfret, with their maſter the captive
                    king of Scotland, and there to treat cf their common intereſts. Moſt of theſe
                    noblemen and gentlemen had before been nominated to treat with the Engliſh about
                    their king’s return; and Dougal Drummond ſeems to have been a domeſtic favourite
                    with James. Hitherto the Scottiſh king had been allowed an annual revenue of 700
                    pounds: but while he was making ready for his journey, his equipages and
                    attendants were increaſed to thoſe befitting a ſovereign; and he received a
                    preſent from the Engliſh treaſury of 100 l. for his private expences. That he
                    might appear with a grandeur every way ſuitable to his dignity, at every ſtage
                    were provided relays of horſes, and all manner of fiſh, fleſh, and fowl, with
                    cooks and other ſervants for furniſhing out the moſt ſumptuous royal
                    entertainment. In this meeting at Pomfret, James acted as a kind of a mediator
                    between the Engliſh and his own ſubjects, to whom he fully laid himſelf open;
                    but, in the mean time, the Engliſh regency iſſued a commiſſion for fettling the
                    terms upon which James was to be reſtored, if he and his commiſſioners ſhould
                    lay a proper foundation for ſuch a treaty. The Engliſh commiſſioners, were the
                    biſhops of Durham and Worceſter, the earls of Northumberland and Weſtmoreland,
                    the lords Nevil, Cornwal, and Chaworth, with matter John Wodeham, and Robert
                    Waterton. The inſtructions they received form one of the moſt curious paſſages
                    of this hiſtory; and we ſhall here give them, as they are neceſſary for
                    confirming all we have ſaid concerning the diſpoſitions of the two courts at
                    this juncture.</p>
                <p>Firſt, To make a faint oppoſition to any private conference between the king of
                    Scotland and the Scotch commiſſioners.</p>
                <p>Secondly, To demand that, before the ſaid king ſhall have his full liberty, the
                    kingdom of Scotland ſhould pay to the Engliſh government at leaſt thirty- ſix
                    thouſand pounds as an equivalent, at two thouſand pounds a-year, for the
                    entertainment of King James, who was maintained by the court of England, and not
                    to abate any thing of that ſum; but if poſſible to get forty thouſand
                    pounds.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, That if the Scots ſhould agree to the payment of the ſaid ſum, the
                    Engliſh commiſſioners ſhould take ſufficient ſecurity and hoſtages for the
                    payment of the ſame; and that if they ſhould not (as there was great reaſon for
                    believing they would) be ſo far mollified, by ſuch eaſy terms, as to offer to
                    enter upon a negociation for a final and perpetual peace between the two people,
                    that then the Engliſh ſhould propoſe the ſame in the moſt handſome manner they
                    could. Farther, that if ſuch difficulties ſhould ariſe as might make it
                    impracticable immediately to conclude ſuch perpetual peace, that the Engliſh
                    ambaſſadors ſhould, under pretence of paving a way for the ſame, propoſe a long
                    truce.</p>
                <p>Fourthly, That in caſe the Engliſh commiſſioners ſhould ſucceed in bringing the
                    Scots to agree to the ſaid truce, they ſhould further urge, that they ſhould not
                    ſend to Charles of France, or to any of the enemies of England, any ſuccours by
                    ſea or land. Farther, that the ſaid Engliſh commiſſioners ſhould employ their
                    utmoſt endeavours to procure the recal of the troops already furniſhed by the
                    Scots to France. The Engliſh are commanded to inſiſt very ſtrenuouſly upon this
                    point, but with diſcretion.</p>
                <p>Fifthly, If the Scots ſhould, as a further bond of amity between the two nations,
                    propoſe a marriage between their king and ſome noblewoman of England, the
                    Engliſh commiſſioners are to make anſwer, That the king of the Scots is well
                    acquainted with many noblewomen, and even thoſe of the blood-royal, in England;
                    and that if the king of the Scots ſhall pleaſe to open his mind more freely on
                    that head, the Engliſh commiſſioners ſhall be very ready to enter upon
                    conferences thereupon.” But (continues the record) in caſe the Scotch
                    commiſſioners ſhould make no mention of any ſuch alliance by marriage, it will
                    not appear decent for the Engliſh to mention the ſame, becauſe the women of
                    England, at leaſt the noblewomen, are not uſed to offer themſelves in marriage
                    to men.</p>
                <p>Sixthly, If there ſhould be any mention made concerning reparation of damages,
                    that the commiſſioners ſhould then proceed upon the ſame as they ſhould think
                    moſt proper; and that they ſhould have power to offer ſafe-conduct to as many of
                    the Scots as ſhould be demanded, for to repair to the court of England. Thoſe
                    inſtructions are dated at Weſtminſter, July 6th 1423.</p>
                <p>Nothing definitive was concluded at this treaty, but that another meeting ſhould
                    be held at York inſtead of Pomfret. This meeting accordingly took place. The
                    Engliſh commiſſioners were, Thomas biſhop of Durham, chancellor of England,
                    Philip biſhop of Wincheſter, Henry Percy earl of Northumberland, and Mr John
                    Wodeham. Thoſe for Scotland were, William biſhop of Glaſgow, George earl of
                    March, James Douglas of Balveny, his brother Patrick abbot of Cambuſkenneth,
                    John abbot of Baimerino, Sir Patrick Dun-<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0789.tif"

                    George Borthwic archdeacon of Glaſgow, and Patric Houſton canon of Glaſgow. On
                    the tenth of September, after their meeting, they came to the following
                    agrcement:</p>
                <p>Firſt, That the king of Scotland and his heirs, as an equivalent for his
                    entertainment while in England, ſhould pay to the king of England and his heirs,
                    at London, in the church of St Paul, by equal proportions, the ſum of forty
                    thouſand pounds Sterling.</p>
                <p>Secondly, That the firſt payment, amounting to the ſum of ten thouſand merks,
                    ſhould be made ſix months after the king of Scotland’s entering his own kingdom;
                    that the like ſum ſhould be paid the next year, and ſo on during the ſpace of
                    ſix years, when the whole ſum would be cleared; unleſs, after payment of forty
                    thouſand merks, the laſt payment of ten thouſand ſhould be remitted, at the
                    intreaty of the moſt illuſtrious prince Thomas duke of Exeter.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, That the king of Scotland, before entering his own kingdom, ſhould give
                    ſufficient hoſtages for performance on his part. But, in regard that the Scots
                    plenipotentiaries had no inſtructions concerning hoſtages, it was agreed,</p>
                <p>Fourthly, That the king of Scotland ſhould be at Branſpath, or Durham, by the
                    firſt of March next, where he ſhould be attended by the nobles of his blood, and
                    other ſubjects, in order to fix the number and quality of the hoſtages.</p>
                <p>Fifthly, That, to cement and perpetuate the amity of the two kingdoms, the
                    governor of Scotland ſhould ſend ambaſſadors to London, with power to conclude a
                    contract of marriage between the king of Scotland and ſome lady of the firſt
                    quality in England.</p>
                <p>James, it is probable, had already fixed his choice upon the lady Joan, daughter
                    to the late earl of Somerſet, who was ſon to John of Gaunt duke of Lancaſter, by
                    his ſecond marriage; but he made his people the compliment, not only of
                    conſulting their opinion, but of concluding the match. The commiſſioners, after
                    their agreement at York, proceeded towards London; and Thomas Somerville of
                    Carnwath, with Walter Ogilvy, were added to their number. Being arrived at that
                    capital, they ratified the former articles, and undertook for their king, that
                    he ſhould deliver his hoſtages to the king of England’s officers, in the city of
                    Durham, before the laſt day of the enſuing month of March; that he ſhould alſo
                    deliver to the ſaid officers four obligatory letters, for the whole ſum of
                    40,000 l. from the four burghs of Edinburgh, Perth, Dundee, and Aberdeen; that
                    he ſhould give his obligatory letter to the ſame purpoſe, before removing from
                    Durham, and ſhould renew the ſame four days after his arrival in his own
                    kingdom; that the hoſtages might be changed from time to time for others of the
                    ſame fortune and quality; that if any of them ſhould die in England, others
                    ſhould be ſent thither in their room; and that while they continued to ſtay in
                    England, they ſhould live at their own charges.</p>
                <p>The marriage of James with the lady Joan Beaufort was celebrated in the beginning
                    of February 1424. The young king of England preſented him with a ſuit of cloth
                    of gold for the ceremony; and the next day he received a legal discharge of
                    10,000 pounds, to be deducted from the 40,000 at which his ranſom was fixed, and
                    which ſum was given as the marriage- portion of the lady. The ceremony being
                    performed, the king and queen ſet out for Durham, where the hoſtages were
                    waiting; and arrived at his own dominions, along with the earl of Northumberland
                    and the chief of the northern nobility, who attended him with great pomp. On the
                    20th of April the ſame year, he was crowned at Scone; alter which ceremony, he
                    followed the example practiſed by other ſovereigns at that time, of knighting
                    ſeveral noblemen and gentlemen.</p>
                <p>During the dependence of the treaty for James’s releaſe, the Scots had emigrated
                    to France in ſuch numbers, that no fewer than 15,000 of them now appeared in
                    arms under the duke of Touraine; but as the hiſtory of the war in that country
                    has already been given under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">France,</hi> we
                    ſhall take no farther notice of it at preſent, but return to the affairs of
                    Scotland.</p>
                <p>On his return James found himſelf in a diſagreeable ſituation. The great maxim of
                    the duke of Albany, when regent, had been to maintain himſelf in power by
                    exempting the lower claſs of people from taxes of every kind. This plan had been
                    continued by his ſon Murdoch; but as the latter was deſtitute of his father’s
                    abilities, the people abuſed their happineſs, and Scotland became ſuch a ſcene
                    of rapine, that no commoner could ſay he had a property in his own eſtate. The
                    Stewart family, on their acceſſion to the crown of Scotland, were poſſeſſed of a
                    very conſiderable patrimonial eſtate, independent of the ſtanding revenues of
                    the crown, which conſiſted chiefly of cuſtoms, wards, and reliefs. The revenues
                    of the paternal eſtate belonging to James, had they been regularly tranſmitted
                    to him, would have more than maintained him in a ſplendour equal to his dignity,
                    while he was in England; nor would he in that caſe have had any occaſion for an
                    allowance from the king of England. But as the duke of Albany never intended
                    that his nephew ſhould return, he parcelled out among his favourites the eſtate
                    of the Stewart family, in ſuch a manner that James upon his return found all his
                    patrimonial revenues gone, and many of them in the hands of his beſt friends; ſo
                    that he had nothing to depend on for the ſupport of himſelf and his court but
                    the crown-revenues above- mentioned, and even ſome of theſe had been mortgaged
                    during the late regency. This circumſtance, of itſelf ſufficiently diſagreeable,
                    was attended with two others, which tended to make it more ſo. The one was, that
                    the hoſtages which had been left for the king’s ranſom in England, being all of
                    them perſons of the firſt rank, were attended by their wives, families,
                    children, and equipages, which rivalled thoſe of the ſame rank in England, and
                    drew a great deal of ready money out of the nation. The other circumſtance aroſe
                    from the charge of the Scots army in France; where Charles, who had never been
                    in a condition to ſupport it, was now reduced to the utmoſt neceſſity: while the
                    revenues of James himſelf were both ſcanty and precarious. To remedy theſe
                    inconveniences, therefore, the king obtained from his parliament an act obliging
                    the ſheriffs of the reſpective counties to inquire what lands and eſtates had
                    belonged to his anceſtors David II. Robert II. and Robert III.; and James formed
                    a reſolution of reſuming theſe lands wherever they could be diſcovered, without
                    regard to perſons or circumſtances. On this<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0790.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0784"/> occasion many
                    of the moſt illuſtrious personages in the kingdom were arreſted: the duke of
                    Albany, his two sons, and the earl of Lennox the duke’s father-in-law, were put
                    to death; though their crimes are not ſpecified by hiſtorians. Buchanan mentions
                    a tradition, that James barbarouſly ſent to the counteſs of Lennox the heads of
                    her father, huſband, and ſons; for the following more barbarous reaſon, that in
                    the bitterneſs of her grief ſhe might drop ſome expreſſions tending to involve
                    others in the ſame cataſtrophe. The counteſs, however, calmly ſaid, “That, if
                    the charges againſt the criminals were proved, they deſerved their fate.”</p>
                <p>James now proceeded with great ſpirit to reform the abuſes which had pervaded
                    every department of the ſtate, protected and encouraged learning and learned
                    men, and even kept a diary in which he wrote down the names of all the learned
                    men whom he thought deſerving of his encouragement. James himſelf wrote ſome
                    poetry; and in muſic was ſuch an excellent compoſer, that he is with good reaſon
                    looked upon as the father of Scots muſic, which has been ſo much admired for its
                    elegant ſimplicity. He introduced organs into his chapels, and a much better
                    ſtyle of architecture into all buildings whether civil or religious. Neither did
                    he confine his cares to the fine arts, but encouraged and protected thoſe of all
                    kinds which were uſeful to ſociety; and, in ſhort, he did more towards the
                    civilization of his people than had been done by any of his predeceſſors.</p>
                <p>In the mean time the truce continued with England. James, however, ſeemed not to
                    have any inclination to enter into a perpetual alliance with that kingdom. On
                    the contrary, in 1428, he entered into a treaty with France; by which it was
                    agreed, that a marriage ſhould be concluded between the dauphin of France,
                    afterwards Louis XI. and the young princeſs of Scotland; and ſo great was the
                    neceſſity of king Charles for troops at that time, that he demanded only 6000
                    forces as a portion for the princeſs.</p>
                <p>The reſt of the reign of James was ſpent in reforming abuſes, curbing the
                    authority of the great barons, and recovering the royal eſtates out of the hands
                    of uſurpers. In this, however, he uſed ſo much ſeverity, that he was at laſt
                    murdered, in the year 1437. The perpetrators of this murder were the earl of
                    Athol; Robert Grahame, who was connected with the earl, and who was diſcontented
                    on account of his loſing the eſtate of Strathern, which had been re-annexed to
                    the crown; and Robert, grandchild and heir to the earl of Athol, and one of the
                    king’s domeſtics. The king had diſmiſſed his army, without even reſerving to
                    himſelf a body-guard, and was at ſupper in a Dominican convent in the
                    neighbourhood of Perth. Grahame had for ſome time been at the head of a gang of
                    outlaws, and is ſaid to have brought a party of them to Perth in the dead of the
                    night, where he poſted them near the convent. Walter Straton, one of the king’s
                    cupbearers, went to bring ſome wine to the king while at ſupper; but perceiving
                    armed men ſtanding in the paſſage, he gave the alarm, and was immediately
                    killed. Catharine Douglas, one of the queen’s maids of honour, ran to bolt the
                    outer door; but the bar was taken away by Robert Stuart, in order to facilitate
                    the entrance of the murderers. The lady thruſt her arm into the ſtaple; but it
                    was inſtantly broken, and the conſpirators ruſhed in upon the king. Patric
                    Dunbar, brother to the earl of March, was killed in attempting to defend his
                    ſovereign, and the queen received two wounds in attempting to interpoſe herſelf
                    betwixt her huſband and the daggers of the aſſaſſins. James defended himſelf as
                    long as he could; but at laſt expired under the repeated ſtrokes of his
                    murderers, after having received 28 wounds.</p>
                <p>After the murder of James I. the crown devolved upon his ſon James II. at that
                    time only ſeven years of age. A parliament was immediately called by the
                    queen-mother, at which the moſt cruel puniſhments were decreed to the murderers
                    of the late king. The crime, no doubt, deſerved an exemplary puniſhment; but the
                    barbarities inflicted on ſome of thoſe wretches are ſhocking to relate. Within
                    leſs than ſix weeks after the death of the king, all the conſpirators were
                    brought to Edinburgh, arraigned, condemned, and executed. The meaner ſort were
                    hanged; but on the earl of Athol and Robert Graham the moſt cruel torments were
                    inflicted, ſuch as pinching with hot irons, diſlocation of the joints,
                    &amp;c. The earl of Athol, had, beſides, a crown of red-hot iron put on his
                    head; and was afterwards cut up alive, his heart taken out, and thrown into a
                    fire. In ſhort, ſo dreadful were theſe puniſhments, that AEneas Sylvius, the
                    pope’s nuncio, who beheld them, ſaid, that he was at a loſs to determine whether
                    the crime committed by the regicides, or the puniſhment inflicted upon them, was
                    the greater.</p>
                <p>As the late king had preſcribed no form of a regency in caſe of his death, the
                    ſettlement of the government became a matter of great difficulty as well as
                    importance. Archibald earl of Douglas, who had been created Duke of Touraine in
                    France, was by far the greateſt ſubject in the kingdom; but as he had not been a
                    favourite in the preceding reign, and the people were now diſguſted with
                    regencies, he was not formally appointed to the adminiſtration, though by his
                    high rank he in fact enjoyed the ſupreme power as long as he lived; which,
                    however, was but a ſhort time. He died the ſame year (1438); and Sir Alexander
                    Livingſtone of Callendar was appointed to ſucceed him as governor of the
                    kingdom, that is, to have the executive power, while William Crichton, as
                    chancellor, had the direction of the civil courts. This was a moſt unfortunate
                    partition of power for the public. The governor and chancellor quarrelled; the
                    latter took poſſeſſion of the king’s perſon and the caſtle of Edinburgh, to
                    neither of which he had any right; but the former had on his ſide the
                    queen-mother, a woman of intrigue and ſpirit. Her ſon was ſhut up in the caſtle
                    of Edinburgh; and in a ſhort time there was no appearance either of law or
                    government in Scotland. The governor’s edicts were counteracted by thoſe of the
                    chancellor under the king’s name, and thoſe who obeyed the chancellor were
                    puniſhed by the governor; while the young earl of Douglas, with his numerous
                    followers and dependents, was a declared enemy of both parties, whom he equally
                    ſought to deſtroy.</p>
                <p>The queen-mother demanded acceſs to her ſon, which Crichton could find no pretext
                    for denying her; and ſhe was accordingly admitted with a ſmall train into the
                    caſtle of Edinburgh. She played her part ſo well,<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0791.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0785"/> and
                    diſſembled with ſo much art, that the chancellor, imagining ſhe had become a
                    convert to his cauſe, treated her with unbounded confidence, and ſuffered her at
                    all hours to have free acceſs to her ſon’s perſon. Pretending that ſhe had vowed
                    a pilgrimage to the white church of Buchan, ſhe recommended the care of her
                    ſon’s perſon, till her return, to the chancellor, in the moſt pathetic and
                    affectionate terms; but, in the mean time, ſhe ſecretly ſent him to Leith,
                    packed up in a clothes- cheſt; and both ſhe and James were received at Stirling
                    by the governor before the eſcape was known. As every thing had been managed in
                    concert with Livingſton, he immediately called together his friends; and laying
                    before them the tyrannical behaviour of, the chancellor, it was reſolved to
                    beſiege him in the caſtle of Edinburgh, the queen promiſing to open her own
                    granaries for the uſe of the army. The chancellor foreſaw the ſtorm that was
                    likely to fall upon him, and ſought to prevent it by applying to the earl of
                    Douglas. That haughty nobleman anſwered him in the terms already mentioned, and
                    that he was preparing to exterminate both parties. The ſiege of Edinburgh caſtle
                    being formed, the chancellor demanded a parley, and to have a perſonal interview
                    with the governor; which the latter, who was no ſtranger to the ſentiments of
                    Douglas, readily agreed to. Common danger united them in a common cauſe; and the
                    chancellor reſigning to the other the cuſtody of the caſtle and the king’s
                    perſon, with the higheſt profeſſions of duty and loyalty, the two competitors
                    ſwore an inviolable friendſhip for each other. Next day the king cemented their
                    union, by confirming both of them in their reſpective charges.</p>
                <p>The lawleſs example of the earl of Douglas encouraged the other great landholders
                    to gratify their private animoſities, ſometimes at the expence of their honour
                    as well as their humanity. A family-difference happened between Sir Allan Stuart
                    of Darnley, and Thomas Boyd of Kilmarnock; but it was concluded that both
                    parties ſhould come to a peaceable agreement at Polmaiſthorn, between Linlithgow
                    and Falkirk, where Stuart was treacherouſly murdered by his enemy. Stuart’s
                    death was revenged by his brother, Sir Alexander Stuart of Beilmouth, who
                    challenged Boyd to a pitched battle, the principals being attended by a retinue
                    which carried the reſemblance of ſmall armies. The conflict was fierce and
                    bloody, each party retiring in its turn, and charging with freſh fury; but at
                    laſt victory declared itſelf for Stuart, the braveſt of Boyd’s attendants being
                    cut off in the field. About this time, the iſlanders, under two of their
                    chieftains, Lauchlan Maclean and Murdoc Gibſon, notorious freebooters, invaded
                    Scotland, and ravaged the province of Lenox with fire and ſword. They were
                    oppoſed by John Colquhoun of Lrrſs, whom they ſlew, ſome ſay treacherouſly, and
                    others, in an engagement at Lochlomond, near Inchmartin. After this, the robbers
                    grew more outrageous than ever, not only filling all the neighbouring country
                    with rapine, but murdering the aged, infants, and the defenceleſs of both ſexes.
                    At laſt, all the labouring hands in the kingdom being engaged in domeſtic
                    broils, none were left for agriculture; and a dreadful famine enſued, which was
                    attended, as uſual, by a peſtilence. James was now about ten years of age; and
                    the wiſeſt part of the kingdom agreed, that</p>
                <p>the public diſtreſſes were owing to a total diſreſpect of the royal authority.
                    The young earl of Douglas never had fewer than 1000, and ſometimes 2000 horſe in
                    his train; ſo that none was found hardy enough to contract him. He pretended to
                    be independent of the king and his courts of law; that he had a right of
                    judicature upon his own large eſtates; and that he was entitled to the exerciſe
                    of royal power. In conſequence of this he iſſued his orders, gave protections to
                    thieves and murderers, affected to brave the king, made knights, and, according
                    to ſome writers, even noblemen, of his own dependents, with a power of fitting
                    in parliament.</p>
                <p>The queen-mother was not wholly guiltleſs of thoſe abuſes. She had fallen in love
                    with and married Sir Janies Stuart, who was commonly called the <hi
                        rend="italic">Black Knight oſ Lorn,</hi> brother to the lord of that title,
                    and a deſcendant of the houſe of Darnley. Affection for her huſband cauſed her
                    to renew her political intrigues; and not finding a ready compliance in the
                    governor, her intereſt inclined towards the party of the Douglaſſes. The
                    governor ſought to ſtrengthen his authority by reſtoring the exerciſe of the
                    civil power, and the reverence due to the perſon of the ſovereign.</p>
                <p>The conduct of the lord Callendar was in many rejects not ſo dtfenſible, either
                    as to prudence or policy. When the queen expreſſed her inclination . that her
                    huſhand might be admitted to ſome part of the adminiſtration, the governor threw
                    both him and his brother the lord Lorn into priſon, on a charge of indutiful
                    practices againſt the ſtate, and abetting the earl of Douglas in his enormities.
                    The queen, taking fire at her huſhand’s impriſonment, was herſelf confined in a
                    mean apartment within the caſtle of Stirling; and a convention of the ſtates was
                    called, to judge in what manner ſhe was to be proceeded againſt. The cafe was
                    unprecedented and difficult; nor can we believe the governor would have carried
                    matters to ſuch extremity, had he not had ſtrong evidences of her illegal
                    behaviour. She was even obliged to diſſemble her reſentment, by making an open
                    profeſſion before the ſtates, that ſhe had always been entirely innocent of her
                    huſband’s practices, and that ſhe would for the future behave as a peaceable and
                    dutiful ſubject to the laws and the ſovereign. Upon making this purgation (as
                    Lindſay calls it), ſhe was releaſed, as alſo her huſband and his brother, being
                    bailed by the chancellor and the lord Gordon, who became fureties for their good
                    behaviour in the penalty of 40c0 merks. The governor was afterwards accuſed of
                    many arbitrary and partial acts of power: and indeed, if we conſider his
                    ſituation, and the violence of the parties which then divided Scotland, it was
                    ahnoſt impoſſible, conſiſtentlywith his own ſafety, to have exerted the virtues
                    either of patriotiſm or moderation.</p>
                <p>The chancellor was exceedingly vexed at the ſmall regard which the governor paid
                    to his perſon and dignity, and ſecretly connected himſelf with the queen-mother;
                    but in the mean time he remained at Edinburgh. The king and his mother continued
                    all this time at Stirling; where the governor, on pretence of conſulting the
                    public ſafety, and that of the king’s perſon, maintained a ſtrong guard, part of
                    which attended James in his juvenile exercises and diverſions. The queen-mother
                    did not fail to repreſent this to her<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0792.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0786"/> ſon as a reſtraint upon his liberty; and
                    obtained his conſent to put himſelf into the chancellor’s hands. The latter, who
                    was a man of activity and courage, knew well how to avail himſelf of this
                    permiſſion; and croſſing the Forth in the dark with a ſtrong body of horſe, they
                    ſurrounded the king as he was hunting next morning by break of day. It was eaſy
                    to perceive from the behaviour of James, that he was no ſtranger to the
                    chancellor’s attempt; but ſome of the king’s guard offering to diſpute the
                    posseſſion of his perſon, Sir William Livingſton, the governor’s eldeſt ſon,
                    reſtrained them, and ſuffered the king to depart quietly. This ſurpriſal
                    happened on a day when the governor was abſent from Stirling; and the
                    chancellor, to make ſure of his royal acquisition, entered Edinburgh at the head
                    of 40000 horſe, where the king and he were received by the citizens with loud
                    acclamations of joy.</p>
                <p>The governor ſhowed no emotion at what had happened; on the contrary, he invited
                    the chancellor to an interview, and ſettled all differences with him in an
                    amicable manner. The young lord Douglas, however, continued to brave both
                    parties. As if he had been a ſovereign prince, he demanded by his ambaſſadors,
                    Malcolm Fleming of Cumbernauld, and Allan Lawder, the inveſtiture of the
                    ſovereignty of Touraine from Charles the ſeventh of France; which being readily
                    granted him, ſerved to increaſe his pride and inſolence. The firſt-fruits of the
                    accommodation between the two great officers of ſtate was the holding of a
                    parliament at Edinburgh, for redreſſing the public diſorders occaſioned by the
                    earl of Douglas; and encouragement was given to all perſons who had been injured
                    to make their complaints. The numbers which on that occaſion reſorted to
                    Edinburgh were incredible; parents, children, and women, demanding vengeance for
                    the murder of their relations, or the plunder of their eſtates; till, by the
                    multiplicity of their complaints, they became without remedy, none being found
                    bold enough to encounter the earl of Douglas, or to endeavour to bring him to a
                    fair trial. The parties therefore were diſmiſſed without relief, and it was
                    reſolved to proceed with the haughty earl in a different manner. Letters were
                    written to him by the governor and chancellor, and in the name of the ſtates,
                    requeſting him to appear with his friends in parliament, and to take that lead
                    in public affairs to which they were intitled by their high rank and great
                    poſſeſſions. The manner in which thoſe letters were penned made the thought-
                    leſs earl conſider them as a tribute due to his greatneſs, and as proceeding
                    from the inability of the government to continue the adminiſtration of public
                    affairs without his countenance and direction. Without dreaming that any man in
                    Scotland would be ſo bold as to attack him, even ſingle or unarmed, he anſwered
                    the letters of the chancellor and governor, by aſſurmg them that he intended to
                    ſet out for Edinburgh: the chancellor, on pretence of doing him honour, but in
                    reality to quiet his ſuſpicions, met him while he was on his journey; and
                    inviting him to his caſtle of Crichton, he there entertained him for ſome days
                    with the greateſt magnificence and appearance of hoſpitality.The earl of Douglas
                    believed all the chancellor’s profeſſions of friendſhip, and even ſharply
                    checked the wiſeſt of his followers, who counſelled him not to depend too much
                    on appearances, or to truſt his brother and himſelf at the ſame time in any
                    place where the chancellor had power. The latter had not only removed the earl's
                    ſuſpicion, but had made him a kind of convert to patriotism, by painting to him
                    the miſeries of his country, and the glory that muſt redound to him and his
                    friends in removing them. It was in vain for his attendants to remind him of his
                    father’s maxim, never to riſk himſelf and his brother at the ſame time: he
                    without heſitation attended the chancellor to Edinburgh; and being admitted into
                    the caſtle, they dined at the ſame table with the king. Towards the end of the
                    entertainment, a bull’s head, the certain prelude of immediate death, was ſerved
                    up. The earl and his brother ſtarted to their feet, and endeavoured to make
                    their eſcape: but armed men ruſhing in, overpowered them, and tying their hands
                    and thoſe of Sir Malcolm Fleming with cords, they were carried to the hill and
                    beheaded. The young king endeavoured with tears to procure their pardon; for
                    which he was ſeverely checked by his unrelenting chancellor.</p>
                <p>In 1443, the king being arrived at the age of 14, declared himſelf out of the
                    years of minority, and took upon himſelf the adminiſtration of affairs. He
                    appears to have been a prince of great ſpirit and reſolution; and he had
                    occaſion for it. He had appointed one Robert Sempil of Fulwood to be chief
                    governor of the caſtle of Dumbarton; but he was killed by one Galbraeth (a noted
                    partizan of the earl of Douglas), who ſeized upon the government of the caſtle.
                    The popularity of the family of Douglas having ſomewhat subſided, and the young
                    earl finding himſelf not ſupported by the chief branches of his family, he began
                    to think, now that the king was grown up, his ſafeſt courſe would be to return
                    to his duty. He accordingly repaired to the king at Stirling; and voluntarily
                    throwing himſelf at his majeſty’s feet, implored his pardon for all his
                    tranſgreſſions, and ſolemnly promiſed that he would ever after ſet a pattern of
                    duty and loyalty to all the reſt of his ſubjects. The king, finding that he
                    inſiſted on no terms but that of pardon, and that he had unconditionally put
                    himſelf into his power, not only granted his requeſt, but made him the partner
                    of his inmoſt councils.</p>
                <p>James had always disliked the murder of the earl of Douglas and his brother; and
                    the chancellor, perceiving the aſcendency which this earl was daily gaining at
                    court, thought it high time to provide for his own ſafety. He therefore reſigned
                    the great ſeal, and retired to the caſtle of Edinburgh, the cuſtody of which he
                    pretended had been granted to him by the late king during his life, or till the
                    preſent king ſhould arrive at the age of 21; and prepared it for a ſiege. The
                    lord Callendar, who knew himſelf equally obnoxious as Crichton was to the earl
                    of Douglas, and that he could not maintain his footing by himſelf, reſigned
                    likewiſe all his poſts, and retired to one of his own houſes, but kept
                    poſſeſſion of the caſtle of Stirling. As both that and the caſtle of Edinburgh
                    were royal forts, the two lords were ſummoned to ſurrender them; but inſtead of
                    complying, they juſtiſied their conduct by the great power of their enemies, who
                    fought their deſtruction, and who had been ſo lately at the head of robbers and
                    outlaws; but promiſed to ſurrender themſelves to the king as ſoon as he was of
                    lawful age, (meaning, we ſuppoſe, either 18 or 21). This anſwer being deemed<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0793.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0787"/> Contumacious,
                    the chancellor and the late governor, with his two ſons Sir Alexander and Sir
                    James Livingſton, were proclaimed traitors in a parliament which was ſummoned on
                    purpoſe to be held at Stirling. In another parliament held at Perth the ſame
                    year, an act paſſed, that all the lands and goods which had belonged to the late
                    king ſhould be poſſeſſed by the preſent king to the time of his lawful age,
                    which is not ſpecified. This act was levelled againſt the late governor and
                    chancellor, who were accuſed of haying alienated to their own uſes, or to thoſe
                    of their friends, a great part of the royal effects and jewels; and their
                    eſtates being confiſcated, the execution of the ſentence was committed to John
                    Forreſter of Corſtorphin, and other adherents of the earl of Douglas.</p>
                <p>This ſentence threw all the nation into a flame. The caſtle of Crichton was
                    beſieged; and being ſurrendered upon the king’s ſummons and the diſplay of the
                    royal banner, it was levelled with the ground. It ſoon appeared that the
                    governor and chancellor, the latter eſpecially, had many friends; and in
                    particular Kennedy biſhop of St Andrew’s, nephew to James the firſt, who ſided
                    with them from the dread and hatred they bore to the earl of Douglas and his
                    family. Crichton thus ſoon found himſelf at the head of a body of men; and while
                    Forreſter was carrying fire and ſword into his eſtates and thoſe of the late
                    governor, his own lands and thoſe of the Douglaſſes were overrun. Corſtorphin,
                    Abercorn, Blackneſs, and other places, were plundered; and Crichton carried off
                    from them more booty than he and his adherents had loſt. Particular mention is
                    made of a fine breed of mares which Douglas had loſt on this occaſion. That
                    nobleman was ſo much exaſperated by the great damages he had ſuſtained, that he
                    engaged his friends the earl of Crawford and Alexander Ogilvy of Innerquharity,
                    to lay waſte the lands of the biſhop of St Andrew’s, whom he conſidered as the
                    chief ſupport of the two miniſters. This prelate was not more conſiderable by
                    his high birth, than he was venerable by his virtue and ſanctity; and had, from
                    a principle of confidence, oppoſed the earl of Douglas and his party. Being
                    conſcious he had done nothing that was illegal, he firſt admoniſhed the earl of
                    Crawford and his coadjutor to deſiſt from deſtroying his lands; but finding his
                    admonitions ineffectual, he laid the earl under an excommunication.</p>
                <p>That nobleman was almoſt as formidable in the northern, as the earl of Douglas
                    had been in the ſouthern, parts of Scotland. The benedictine monks of
                    Aberbrothwic, who were poſſeſſed of great property, had choſen Alexander
                    Lindſay, his eldeſt ſon, to be the judge or bailiff of their temporalities; as
                    they themſelves, by their profeſſion, could not fit in civil or criminal courts.
                    Lindſay proved ſo chargeable, by the great number of his attendants, and his
                    high manner of living, to the monks, that their chapter removed him from his
                    poſt, and ſubſtituted in his place Alexander Ogilvy of Innerquharity, guardian
                    to his nephew John Ogilvy of Airley, who had an hereditary claim upon the
                    bailiwick. This, notwithſtanding their former intimacy, created an
                    irreconcileable difference between the two families. Each competitor
                    ſtrengthened himself by calling in the aſſiſtance of his friends; and the Lord
                    Gordon taking part with the Ogilvies, to whom he was then paying a viſit, both
                    parties immediately muſtered in, the neighbourhood of Aberbrothwic. The earl of
                    Crawford, who was then at Dundee, immediately poſted to Aberbrothwic, and
                    placing himſelf between the two armies, he demanded to ſpeak with Ogilvy; but,
                    before his requeſt could be granted, he was killed by a common ſoldier, who was
                    ignorant of his quality. His death exaſperated his friends, who immediately
                    ruſhed on their enemies; and a bloody conflict enſued, which ended to the
                    advantage of the Lindſays, that is, the earl of Crawford’s party. On that of the
                    Ogilvies were killed Sir John Oliphant of Aberdagy, John Forbes of Pitſligo,
                    Alexander Barclay of Gartley, Robert Maxwel of Teling, Duncan Campbell of
                    Campbelfether, William Gordon of Burrowſield, and others. With thoſe gentlemen,
                    about 500 of their followers are ſaid to have fallen; but ſome accounts diminiſh
                    that number. Innerquharity himſelf, in flying, was taken priſoner, and carried
                    to the earl of Crawford’s houſe at Finhaven, where he died of his wounds; but
                    the Lord Gordon (or, as others call him, the earl of Huntley) eſcaped by the
                    ſwiftneſs of his horſe.</p>
                <p>This battle ſeems to have let looſe the fury of civil diſcord all over the
                    kingdom. No regard was paid to magiſtracy, nor to any deſcription of men but
                    that of clergy. The moſt numerous, fierceſt, and beſt allied family, wreaked its
                    vengeance on its foes, either by force or treachery; and the enmity that
                    actuated the parties, ſtiffled every ſentiment of honour, and every feeling of
                    humanity. The Lindſays, ſecretly abetted and ſtrengthened by the earl of
                    Douglas, made no other uſe of their victory than carrying fire and ſword through
                    the eſtates of their enemies; and thus all the north of Scotland preſented
                    ſcenes of murder and devaſtation. In the weſt, Robert Boyd of Duchal, governor
                    of Dumbarton, treacherouſly ſurpised Sir James Stuart of Achmynto, and treated
                    his wife with ſuch inhumanity, that ſhe expired in three days under her
                    confinement in Dumbarton caſtle. The caſtle of Dunbar was taken by Patrick
                    Hepburn of Hales. Alexander Dunbar diſpoſſeſſed the latter of his caſtle of
                    Hales; but it was retaken by the partiſans of the earl of Douglas, whoſe
                    tenants, particularly thoſe of Annandale, are ſaid to have behaved at that time
                    with peculiar fierceneſs and cruelty. At laſt, the gentlemen of the country, who
                    were unconnected with thoſe robbers and murderers, which happened to be the cafe
                    with many, ſhut themſelves up in their ſeveral houſes; each of which, in thoſe
                    days, was a petty fortreſs, which they victualled, and provided in the beſt
                    manner they could for their own defence. This wiſe reſolution ſeems to have been
                    the firſt meaſure that compoſed the public commotions.</p>
                <p>The earl of Douglas, whoſe power and influence at court ſtill continued, was
                    ſenſible that the clergy, with the wiſer and more diſintereſted part of the
                    kingdom, conſidered him as the ſource of the dreadful calamities which the
                    nation ſuffered; and that James himſelf, when better informed, would be of the
                    ſame opinion. He therefore ſought to avail himſelf of the juncture, by forming
                    ſecret but ſtrong connections with the earls of Crawford, Roſs, and other great
                    noblemen, who wanted to ſee their feudal powers reſtored to their full vigour.
                    The queen-dowager and her huſband made little or no figure during this ſeaſon of
                    public confuſion: ſhe<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0794.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0788"/> had retired to the caſtle of Dunbar, while it
                    was in Hepburn’s poſſeſſion, where ſhe died ſoon after. She left by her ſecond
                    huſband three ſons; John, who in 1455 was made earl of Athol, by his uterine
                    brother the king; James, who under the next reign, in 1469, was created earl of
                    Buchan; and Andrew, who afterwards became biſhop of Murray. As the earl of
                    Douglas was an enemy to the queen-dowager’s huſband, the latter retired to
                    England, where he obtained a paſs to go abroad, with 20 in his train; but being
                    taken at ſea by the Flemiſh pirates, he died in his confinement.</p>
                <p>The great point between the king and Sir William Crichton, whether the latter
                    ſhould give up the caſtle to his majeſty, remained ſtill undecided; and by the
                    advice and direction of the earl of Douglas, who had been created
                    lord-lieutenant of the kingdom, it had now ſuffered a nine months liege. Either
                    the ſtrength of the caſtle, or an opinion entertained by Douglas that Crichton
                    would be a valuable acquiſition to his party, procured better terms for the
                    latter than he could otherwiſe have expected; for he and his followers were
                    offered a full indemnity for all paſt offences, and a promiſe was made that he
                    ſhould be reſtored not only to the king’s favour, but to his former poſt of
                    chancellor. He accepted of the conditions; but refuſed to act in any public
                    capacity till they were confirmed by a parliament, which was ſoon after held at
                    Perth, and in which he was reſtored to his eſtate and honours. By this
                    reconciliation between Douglas and Crichton, the former was left at full liberty
                    to proſecute his vengeance againſt the Lord Callendar, the late governor, his
                    friends and family. That vengeance was exerciſed with rigour. The governor
                    himſelf, Sir James Dundas of Dundas, and Sir Robert Bruce of Clackmannan, were
                    forced to ſave their lives by the loſs of their eſtates; but even</p>
                <p>that could not preſerve their liberty, for they were ſent priſoners to the caſtle
                    of Dumbarton. The fate of Alexander, the governor’s eldeſt ſon, and of two other
                    gentlemen of his name and family, was ſtill more lamentable; for they were
                    condemned to loſe their heads. Thoſe ſeverities being inflicted after the king
                    had in a manner readmitted the ſufferers into his favour, ſwelled the public
                    outcry againſt the earl of Douglas. We have in Lindſay an extract of the ſpeech
                    which Alexander Livingſton, one of the moſt accompliſhed gentlemen of his time,
                    made upon the ſcaffold, in which he complained, with great bitterneſs, of the
                    cruel treatment his father, himſelf, and his friends, had undergone; and that he
                    ſuffered by a packed jury of his enemies.</p>
                <p>The king being now about 18 years of age, it was thought proper that a ſuitable
                    confort ſhould be provided for him; and, after various conſultations, Mary, the
                    daughter of Arnold duke of Gueldres, was choſen, at the recommendation of
                    Charles king of France, though the marriage was not completed till ſome time
                    after. This produced an immediate rupture with England. The earls of Saliſbury
                    and Northumberland entered Scotland at the head of two ſeparate bodies. The
                    former burnt the town of Dumfries, as the latter did that of Dunbar; while Sir
                    John Douglas of Balveny made repriſals by plundering the county of Cumberland,
                    and burning Alnwic. Upon the return of the Engliſh armies to their own country,
                    additional levies were made, and a freſh invasion of Scotland was reſolved
                    up</p>
                <p>on under the earl of Northumberland, who had along with him a lieutenant, whom
                    the Scots of thoſe days, from the buſhineſs and colour of his beard, called <hi
                        rend="italic">Magnus with the red mane.</hi> He was a ſoldier of fortune,
                    but an excellent officer, having been trained in the French wars; and he is ſaid
                    to have demanded no other recompenſe for his ſervices from the Engliſh court,
                    but that he ſhould enjoy all he could conquer in Scotland. The Scots, in the
                    mean time, had raiſed an army commanded by George Douglas earl of Ormond, and
                    under him by Wallace of Craigie, with the Lords Maxwell and Johnſton. The
                    Engliſh having paſſed Solway Frith, ravaged all that part of the country which
                    belonged to the Scots; but hearing that the earl of Ormond’s army was
                    approaching, called in their parties, and fixed their camp on the banks of the
                    river Sark. Their advanced guard was commanded by Magnus; their centre by the
                    earl of Northumberland; and the rear, which was compoſed of Welch, by Sir John
                    Pennington, an officer of courage and experience.</p>
                <p>The Scots drew up in three diviſions likewiſe. Their right wing was commanded by
                    Wallace, the centre by the earl of Ormond, and their left wing by the Lords
                    Maxwell and Johnſton. Before the battle joined, the earl of Ormond harangued his
                    men, and inſpired them with very high reſentment againſt the Engliſh, who, he
                    ſaid, had treacherouſly broken the truce. The ſignal for battle being given, the
                    Scots under Wallace ruſhed forward upon their enemies: but, as uſual, were
                    received by ſo terrible a diſcharge from the Engliſh archers, that their
                    impetuoſity muſt have been flopped, had not their brave leader Wallace put them
                    in mind, that their forefathers had always been defeated in diſtant fights by
                    the Engliſh, and that they ought to truſt to their ſwords and spears; commanding
                    them at the ſame time to follow his example. They obeyed, and broke in upon the
                    Engliſh commanded by Magnus, with ſuch fury, as ſoon fixed the fortune of the
                    day on the ſide of the Scots, their valour being ſuitably ſeconded by their
                    other two diviſions. The ſlaughter (which was the more conſiderable as both
                    parties fought with the utmoſt animoſity) fell chiefly upon the diviſion
                    commanded by Magnus, who was killed, performing the part of a brave officer; and
                    all his body-guard, conſiſting of picked ſoldiers, were cut in pieces.</p>
                <p>The battle then became general: Sir John Pennington’s diviſion, with that under
                    the earl of Northumberland, was likewiſe routed; and the whole Engliſh army,
                    ſtruck by the loſs of their champion, fled towards the Solway, where, the river
                    being ſwelled by the tide, numbers of them were drowned. The loſs of the Engliſh
                    in ſlain amounted to at leaſt 3000 men. Among the priſoners were Sir John
                    Pennington, Sir Robert Harrington, and the earl of Northumberland’s eldeſt ſon
                    the Lord Percy, who loſt his own liberty in forwarding his father’s eſcape. Of
                    the Scots about 600 were killed; but none of note, excepting the brave Wallace,
                    who died three months after of the wounds he had received in this battle. The
                    booty that was made on this occaſion is ſaid to have been greater than any that
                    has fallen to the Scots ſince the battle of Barunockburn.</p>
                <p>The reſt of the hiſtory of this reign conſiſts almoſt entirely of a relation of
                    the cabals and conſpiracies of the great men. The earl of Douglas had entered
                    into a<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0795.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0789"/>
                    confederacy with the earls of Crawford, Moray, and Rofs, and appeared on all
                    occaſions with ſuch a train of followers as bade defiance to royal power itſelf.
                    This inſolence was deteſted by the wiſer part of the nation; and one Maclellan,
                    who is called the <hi rend="italic">Tutor of Bomby,</hi> and was nephew to Sir
                    Patrick Gray, captain of the king’s guard, refused to give any attendance upon
                    the earl, or to concur in his meatures, but remained at home as a quiet ſubject.
                    This inoffenſive behaviour was by the carl conſidered as treaſon againſt
                    himſelf; and violently ſeizing upon Maclellan's houſe and perſon, he ſent him
                    cloſe priſoner to the caſtle of Douglas. As Maclellan was a gentleman of great
                    worth and reputation, his uncle Gray applied earneſtly to James in his favour;
                    and ſuch was that prince’s regard for Maclellan, that he wrote and ſigned a
                    letter for his releaſe, addreſſed to the earl of Douglas. Upon Gray’s delivering
                    this letter to Douglas at his caſtle, the latter ſeemed to receive it with the
                    higheſt reſpect, and to treat Gray with the greateſt hoſpitality, by inviting
                    him to dinner; but, in the mean time, he gave private orders that Maclellan’s
                    head ſhould be ſtruck off, and his body expoſed upon the green before the caſtle
                    covered with a linen cloth. After dinner, the earl told Gray, that he was ready
                    to obey the king’s commands; and conducting him to the green, he ſhowed him the
                    lifeless trunk, which he ſaid Gray might diſpoſe of as he pleaſed. Upon this,
                    Gray mounted his horſe, and truſted to his ſwiftneſs for his own ſafety; for he
                    was purſued by the earl's attendants to the gates of Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>The conſpiracy againſt James’s government was now no longer a ſecret. The Lords
                    Balveny and Hamilton, with ſuch a number of other barons and gentlemen, had
                    acceded to it, that it was thought to be more powerful than all the force the
                    king could bring into the field. Even Crichton adviſed James to diſſemble. The
                    confederates entered into a ſolemn bond and oath never to deſert one another
                    during life; and, to make uſe of Drummond’s words, “That injuries done to any
                    one of them ſhould be done to them all, and be a common quarrel; neither ſhould
                    they deſiſt, to their belt abilities, to revenge them: that they ſhould concur
                    indifferently againſt whatſoever perſons within or without the realm, and ſpend
                    their lives, lands, goods, and fortunes, in defence of their debates and
                    differences whatſoever.” All who did nor enter into this aſſociation were
                    treated as enemies to the public; their lands were deſtroyed, their effects
                    plundered, and they themſelves impriſoned or murdered. Drummond lays, that
                    Douglas was then able to bring 40,000 men into the field; and that his intention
                    was to have placed the crown of Scotland upon his own head. How far he might
                    have been influenced by a ſcene of the ſame nature that was then paſſing between
                    the houſes of York and Lancaſter in England, we ſhall not pretend to determine;
                    though it does not appear that his intention was to wear the crown himſelf, but
                    to render it deſpicable upon his ſovereign’s head. It is rather evident, from
                    his behaviour, that he did not affect royalty; for wſhen James invited him to a
                    conference in the caſtle of Stirling, he offered to comply provided he had a
                    ſafe conduct. This condition plainly implied, that he had no reliance upon the
                    late act of parliament, which declared the proclamation, of the king's peace to
                    be a ſufficient ſecurity for life and fortune to all his ſubjects; and there is
                    no denying that the ſafe conduct was expedited in the form and manner
                    required.</p>
                <p>This being obtained, the earl began his march towards Stirling with his uſual
                    great retinue; and arrived there on Shrove-Tueſday. He was received by the king
                    as if he had been the beſt of his friends, as well as the greateſt of his
                    ſubjects, and admitted to ſup with his majeſty in the caſtle, while his
                    attendants were diſperſed in the town, little ſuſpecting the cataſtrophe that
                    followed. The entertainment being over, the king told the earl with an air oſ
                    frankneſs, “That as he was now of age, he was reſolved to be the father of all
                    his people, and to take the government into his own hands; that his lordſhip,
                    therefore, had no reaſon to be under any apprehenſions from his old enemies
                    Callendar and Crichton; that there was no occaſion to form any confederacies, as
                    the law was ready to protect him; and that he was welcome to the principal
                    direction of affairs under the crown, and to the firſt place in the royal
                    confidence; nay, that all former offences done by himſelf and his friends ſhould
                    be pardoned and forgot.”</p>
                <p>This ſpeech was the very reverſe of what the earl of Douglas aimed at. It
                    rendered him, indeed, the firſt ſubject of the kingdom; but ſtill he was
                    controulable by the civil law. In ſhort, upon the king’s peremptorily putting
                    the queſtion to him, he not only refuſed to diſſolve the confederacy, but
                    upbraided the king for his government. This produced a paſſionate rejoinder on
                    the part of James; but the earl repreſented that he was under a ſafe conduct,
                    and that the nature of his confederacy was ſuch, that it could not be broken but
                    by the common conſent of all concerned. The king inſiſted upon his ſetting the
                    example; and the earl continuing more and more obſtinate, James ſtabbed him with
                    his dagger; and armed men ruſhing into the room, finiſhed the ſlaughter.</p>
                <p>After the death of the earl oſ Douglas, the confede. racy came to nothing. The
                    inſurgents excuſed themſelves as being too weak for ſuch an enterpriſe; and were
                    contented with trailing the ſafe conduct at a horſe’s tail, and proclaiming, by
                    trumpets and horns, the king a perjured traitor. They proceeded no farther; and
                    each departed to his own habitation, after agreeing to aſſemble with freſh
                    forces about the beginning of April. James loſt no time in improving this ſhort
                    reſpite; and found the nation in general much better diſpoſed in his favour than
                    he had reaſon to expect. The intolerable oppreſſions of the great barons made
                    his ſubjects eſteem the civil, far preferable to the feudal, ſubjection: and
                    even the Douglaſſes were divided among themſelves; for the earl of Angus and Sir
                    John Douglas of Dalkeith were among the moſt forward of the rovaliſts. James at
                    the ſame time wrote letters to the earl of Huntley, and to all the noblemen of
                    his kingdom who were not parties in the confederacy, beſides the eccleſiaſtics,
                    who remained firmly attached to his prerogative. Before the effect of thoſe
                    letters could be known, the inſurgents had returned to Stirling (where James

                    were obliged to ſupply, they left Stirling, and deſtroyed the eſtate of Sir John
                    Douglas of Dab keſth, whom they conſidered as a double traitor, because he was a
                    Douglas and a good ſubject. They then beſieged his caſtle: but it was ſo bravely
                    defended by Patrick Cockburn, a gentleman of the family of Langton, that they
                    raiſed the ſiege; which gave the royal party farther leiſure for humbling
                    them.</p>
                <p>All this time the unhappy country was ſuffering the moſt cruel devaſtations; for
                    matters were now come to ſuch extremity, that it was neceſſary for every man to
                    be a royaliſt or a rebel. The king was obliged to keep on the defenſive; and
                    though he had ventured to leave the caſtle of Stirling, he was in no condition
                    to face the rebels in the field. They were in poſſeſſion of all the ſtrong
                    paſſes by which his friends were to march to his aſſiſtance; and he even
                    conſulted with his attendants on the means of eſcaping to France, where he was
                    ſure of an hoſpitable reception. He was diverted from that reſolution by biſhop
                    Kennedy and the earl of Angus, who was himſelf a Douglas, and prevailed upon to
                    wait for the event of the earl of Huntley’s attempts for his ſervice. This
                    nobleman, who was deſcended from the Seatons, but by marriage inherited the
                    great eſtates of the Gordons in the north, had raiſed an army for James, to
                    whoſe family he and his anceſtors, by the Gordons as well as the Seatons, had
                    been always remarkably devoted. James was not miſtaken in the high opinion he
                    had of Huntley; and in the mean time he iſſued circular letters to the chief
                    eccleſiaſtics and bodies-politic of his kingdom, ſetting forth the neceſſity he
                    was under to proceed as he had done, and his readineſs to protect all his loyal
                    ſubjects in their rights and privileges againſt the power of the Douglaſſes and
                    their rebellious adherents. Before thoſe letters could have any effect, the
                    rebels had plundered the defenceleſs houſes and eſtates of all who were not in
                    their confederacy, and had proceeded with a fury that turned to the prejudice of
                    their cauſe.</p>
                <p>The indignation which the public had conceived againſt the king, for the
                    violation of his ſafe conduct, began now to ſubſide; and the behaviour of his
                    enemies in ſome meaſure juſtiſied what had happened, or at leaſt made the people
                    ſuſpect that James would not have proceeded as he did without the ſtrongeſt
                    provocation. The forces he had aſſembled being unable, as yet, to act
                    offenſively, he reſolved to wait for the earl of Huntley, wſho by this time was
                    at the head of a conſiderable army, and had begun his march southwards. He had
                    been joined by the Forbeſes, Ogilvies, Leſlies, Grants, Irvings, and other
                    relations and dependents of his family; but having advanced as far as Brechin,
                    he was oppoſed by the earl of Crawford, the chief ally of the earl of Douglas,
                    who commanded the people of Angus, and all the adherents of the rebels in the
                    neighbouring counties, headed by foreign officers. The two armies joining battle
                    on the 18th of May, victory was for ſome time in ſuſpence; till one Coloss of
                    Bonnymoon, on whom Crawford had great dependence, but whom he had imprudently
                    diſobliged, came over to the royaliſts with the diviſion he commanded, which was
                    the beſt aimed part of Crawford's army, conſiſting of battle-axes, broad ſwords,
                    and long ſpears His defection gave the fortune of the day to the earl of
                    Huntley, as it left the centre flank of Crawford’s army en</p>
                <p>tirely expoſed to the royaliſts. He himſelf loſt one of his brothers; and fled
                    with another, Sir John Lindſay, to his houſe at Finhaven, where it is reported
                    that he broke out into the following ejaculation: “That he would be content to
                    remain ſeven years in hell, to have in ſo timely a ſeaſon done the king his
                    mailer that ſervice the earl of Huntly had performed, and carry that applauſe
                    and thanks he was to receive from him.”</p>
                <p>No author informs us of the loſs of men on either fide, though all agree that it
                    was very conſiderable upon the whole. The earl of Huntley, particularly, loſt
                    two brothers, William and Henry; and we are told, that, to indemnify him for his
                    good ſervices, as well as for the rewards and preſents he had made in lands and
                    privileges to his faithful followers, the king beſtowed upon him the lands of
                    Badenoch and Lochaher.</p>
                <p>The battle of Brcchin was not immediately deciſive in favour of the king, but
                    proved ſo in its conſequences. The earl of Moray, a Douglas likewiſe, took
                    advantage of Huntley's abſence to haraſs and ravage the eſtates of all the
                    royaliſts in the north; but Huntley returning from Brechin with his victorious
                    army, drove his enemy into his own county of Moray, and afterwards expelled him
                    even from thence. James was now encouraged, by the advice of his kinſman Kennedy
                    biſhop of St Andrew’s, to whoſe ſirmneſs and prudence he was under great
                    obligations, to proceed againſt the rebels in a legal manner, by holding a
                    parliament at Edinburgh, to which the confederated lords were ſummoned; and upon
                    their non-compearance, they were ſolemnly declared traitors. This proceeding
                    ſeemed to make the rebellion rage more fiercely than ever; and at laſt, the
                    confederates, in fact, diſowned their allegiance to James. The earls of Douglas,
                    Crawford, Ormond, Moray, the Lord Balveny Sir James Hamilton, and others, ſigned
                    with their own hands public manifeſtoes, which were paſted on the doors of the
                    principal chinches, importing, “That they were reſolved never to obey command or
                    charge, nor anſwer citation for the time coming; becauſe the king, ſo far from
                    being a juſt maſter, was a bloodſucker, a murderer, a tranſgresſor of
                    hoſpitality, and a ſurpriſer of the innocent.” It does not appear that thoſe and
                    the like atrocious proceedings did any ſervice to the cauſe of the confederates.
                    The earl of Huntley continued victorious in the north; where he and his
                    followers, in revenge for the earl of Moray’s having burnt his caſtle of
                    Huntley, ſeized or ravaged all that nobleman's great eſtate north of the Spey.
                    When he came to the town of Forres, he burnt one fide of the town, becauſe it
                    belonged to the earl, and ſpared the other, becauſe it was the property of his
                    own friends. James thought himſelf, from the behaviour of the earl of Douglas
                    and his adherents, now warranted to come to extremities; and marching into
                    Annandale, he carried fire and ſword through all the eſtates of the Douglaſſes
                    there. The earl of Crawford, on the other hand, having now recruited his
                    ſtrength, deltroyed the lands of all the people of Angus and of all others who
                    had abandoned him at the battle of Brechin; though there is reaſon to believe,
                    that he had already ſecretly reſolved to throw himſelf upon the king’s
                    mercy.</p>
                <p>Nothing but the moſt obſtinate pride and reſentment could have prevented the earl
                    of Douglas, at this time, from taking the advice of his friends, by returning
                        to<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0797.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0791"/> his
                    duty; in which caſe, James had given ſufficient intimations that he might expect
                    pardon. He coloured his contumacy with the ſpecious pretext, that his brother's
                    fate, and thoſe of his two kinſmen, ſufficiently inſtructed him never to truſt
                    to James or his miniſters; that he had gone too far to think now of receding;
                    and that kings, when once offended, as James had been, never pardoned in good
                    earneſt. Such were the chief reaſons, with others of leſs conſequence, which
                    Drummond has put into the mouth of Douglas at this time. James, after his
                    expedition into Annandale, found the ſeaſon too far advanced to continue his
                    operations; and returning to Edinburgh, he marched northwards to Angus, to
                    reduce the earl of Crawford, who was the ſecond rebel of power in the kingdom.
                    That nobleman had hitherto deferred throwing himſelf at the king’s feet, and had
                    reſumed his arms, in the manner related, only in hopes that better terms might
                    be obtained from James for himſelf and his party. Perceiving that the earl of
                    Douglas’s obſtinacy had cooled ſome other lords of the confederacy, and had put
                    an end to all hopes of a treaty, he reſolved to make a merit of breaking the
                    confederacy, by being the firſt to ſubmit. James having arrived in Angus, was
                    continuing his march through the country, when the earl and ſome of his chief
                    followers fell on their knees before him on the road, bareheaded and barefooted.
                    Their dreary looks, their ſuppliant poſtures, and the tears which ſtreamed
                    abundantly from the earl, were expreſſive of the moſt abject contrition; which
                    was followed by a penitential ſpeech made by the earl, acknowledging his crimes,
                    and imploring forgiveneſs.</p>
                <p>James was then attended by his chief counſellois, particularly biſhop Kennedy,
                    who, he reſolved, ſhould have ſome ſhare in the favour he meant to extend to the
                    earl. He aſked their advice; which proving to be on the merciful ſide, James
                    promiſed to the earl and his followers reſtitution of all their eſtates and
                    honours, and full pardon for all that had paffed. The earl, as a grateful
                    retribution for this favour, before the king left Angus, joined him with a noble
                    troop of his friends and followers; and, attending him to the north, was
                    extremely active in foppreſſing all the remains of the rebellion there.</p>
                <p>The ſubmiſſion of the earl of Crawford was followed by that of the earl of
                    Douglas; which, however, continued only for a ſhort time. This powerful nobleman
                    ſoon reſumed his rebellious practices; and, in the year 1454, raiſed an army to
                    fight againſt the king. The king erected his ſtandard at St Andrew’s; marched
                    from thence to Falkland; and ordered all the forces of Fife, Angus, and
                    Strathern, with thoſe of the northern parts, to rendezvous by a certain day at
                    Stirling; which they did to the number of 30,000. Douglas aſſembled his forces,
                    which amounted to 40,000, ſome ſay 60,000 men, on the ſouth ſide of the river
                    Carron, about half way between Stirling and Abercorn. However, notwithſtanding
                    this ſuperiority of force, the earl did not think it proper to fight his
                    ſovereign. Biſhop Kennedy, the prelate of St Andrew’s, had adviſed the king to
                    divide his enemies by offering them pardon ſeparately; and ſo good an effect had
                    this, that in a few days the earl found himſelf deſerted by all his numerous
                    army, excepting about 100 of his neareſt friends and domeſtics, with whom he
                    retired towards England. His</p>
                <p>friends had indeed adviſed him to come to a battle immediately ; but the earl,
                    for reaſons now unknown, refuſed. However, in his journey ſouthward, he railed a
                    conſiderable body of forces, confiding of his own tenants, of outlaws, robbers,
                    and borderers, with whom he renewed his depredations on the loyal ſubjects of
                    the king. He was oppoſed by the earl of Angus, who, though of the name of
                    Douglas, continued firm in the royal cauſe. An engagement enſued at Ancrammuir;
                    where Douglas was entirely defeated, and he himſelf with great difficulty
                    eſcaped to an adjacent wood. What his fate was after this battle does not
                    appear; but it is certain that his eſtates were afterwards forfeited to the
                    king.</p>
                <p>The reſt of the reign of James II. was ſpent in making proper regulations for the
                    good of his people. In 1460 he was killed at the ſiege of Roxburgh caſtle, by
                    the burſting of a cannon, to which he was too near when it was diſcharged. This
                    ſiege he had undertaken in favour of the queen of England, who, after loſing
                    ſeveral battles, and being reduced to diſtreſs, was obliged to apply to James
                    for relief. The nobility who were preſent concealed his death, for fear of
                    diſcouraging the ſoldiers; and in a few hours after, the queen appeared in the
                    camp, and preſented her young ſon, James III. as their king.</p>
                <p>James III. was not quite ſeven years of age at his acceſſion to the crown. The
                    adminiſtration naturally devolved on his mother; who puſhed the ſiege of
                    Roxburgh caſtle with ſo much vigour, that the garriſon was obliged to capitulate
                    in a few days; after which the army ravaged the country, and took and diſmantled
                    the caſtle of Wark.—In 1466, negociations were begun for a marriage between the
                    young king and Margaret princeſs of Denmark; and, in 1468, the following
                    conditions were ſtipulated. 1. That the annual rent hitherto paid for the
                    northern Iſles of Orkney and Shetland ſhould be for ever remitted and
                    extinguiſhed. 2. That king Chriſtiern, then king of Denmark, ſhould give 60,000
                    florins of gold for his daughter’s portion, whereof 10,000 ſhould be paid before
                    her departure from Denmark; and that the iſlands of Orkney ſhould be made over
                    to the crown of Scotland, by way of pledge for the remainder; with this expreſs
                    proviſo, that they ſhould return to that of Norway after complete payment of the
                    whole ſum. 3. That king James ſhould, in caſe of his dying before the ſaid
                    Margaret his ſρouſe, leave her in poſſeſſion of the palace of Linlithgow and
                    caſtle of Down in Menteith, with all their appurtenances, and the third part of
                    the ordinary revenues of the crown, to be enjoyed by her during life, in caſe
                    ſhe ſhould chooſe to reſide in Scotland 4. But if ſhe rather choſe to return to
                    Denmark, that in lieu of the ſaid liferent, palace, and caſtle, ſhe ſhould
                    accept of 120,000 florins of the Rhine; from which ſum the 50,000 due for the
                    remainder of her portion being deduced and allowed, the iſlands of Orkney ſhould
                    be reannexed to the crown of Norway as before.</p>
                <p>When theſe articles were agreed upon, Chriſtiern found himſelf unable to fulfil
                    his part of them. Being at that time engaged in an unſucceſsful war with Sweden,
                    he could not advance the 10,000 florins which he had promiſed to pay down as
                    part of his daughter’s fortune. He was therefore obliged to apply to the
                    plenipotentiaries to accept of 2000, and to take a farther<pb

                    the iſles of Shetland for the other 8000, The Scottiſh plenipotentiaries, of
                    whom Boyd earl of Arran was one, gratified him in his requeſt; and this
                    conceſſion is thought to have proved fatal to the earl. Certain it is, that his
                    father was beheaded for treasonable practices alleged to have been committed
                    long before, and for which he produced a parliamentary indemnity to no purpoſe:
                    the earl himſelf was divorced from his wife the king’s filter, and obliged to
                    live in perpetual exile, while the counteſs was married to another.</p>
                <p>In 1476, thoſe misfortunes began to come on James which afterwards terminated in
                    his ruin. He had made his brother, the duke of Albany, governor of Berwick; and
                    had entruſted him with very extenſive powers upon the borders, where a violent
                    propenſity for the feudal law ſtill continued. The Humes and the Hepburns, then
                    the moſt powerful ſubjects in thoſe parts, could not brook the duke of Albany's
                    greatneſs, eſpecially after he had forced them, by virtue of a late act, to part
                    with ſome of the eſtates which had been inconſiderately granted them in this and
                    the preceding reign. The pretended ſcience of judicial aſtrology, by which James
                    happened to be incredibly infatuated, was the eaſieſt as well as moſt effectual
                    engine that could work their purpoſes. One Andrew, an infamous impoſtor in that
                    art, had been brought over from Flanders by James; and he and Schevez, then
                    archbiſhop of St Andrew’s, concurred in perſuading James that the Scotch lion
                    was to be devoured by his own whelps; a prediction that, to a prince of James’s
                    turn, amounted to a certainty.</p>
                <p>The condition to which James reduced himſelf by his belief in judicial aſtrology,
                    was truly deplorable. The princes upon the continent were ſmitten with the ſame
                    infatuation; and the wretches who beſieged his peribn had no ſafety but by
                    continuing the deluſion in his mind. According to Lindſay, Cochran, who had ſome
                    knowledge of architecture, and had been introduced to James as a maſter-maſon,
                    privately procured an old woman, who pretended to be a witch, and who heightened
                    his terrors by declaring that his brothers intended to murder him. James
                    believed her; and the unguarded manner in which the earl of Mar treated his
                    weakneſs, exaſpersoted him ſo much, that the earl giving a farther looſe to his
                    tongue in railing againſt his brother’s unworthy favourites, was arreſted, and
                    committed to the caſtle of Craig Miller; from whence he was brought to the
                    Canongate, a ſuburb of Edinburgh, where he ſuffered death.</p>
                <p>The duke of Albany was at the caſtle of Dunbar when his brother the earl of Mar's
                    tragedy was acted; and James could not be eaſy without having him like- wise in
                    his power. In hopes of ſurpriſing him, he marched to Dunbar: but the duke, being
                    apprized of his coming, fled to Berwick, and ordered his caſtle of Dunbar to be
                    ſurrendered to the lord Evendale, though not before the garriſon had provided
                    themſelves with boats and final! veſſels, in which they eſcaped to England. He
                    ventured to come to Edinburgh; where James was ſo well ſerved with ſpies, that
                    he was ſeized,</p>
                <p>and committed close prisoner to the caſtle, with orders that he ſhould ſpeak with
                    none but in the preſſence of his keepers. The duke had probably ſuſpected and
                    provided againſt this diſagreeable event; ſor we are told that he had agents,
                    who every day repaired to the caſtle, as if they had come from court, and
                    reported the ſtate of matters between him and the king, while his keepers were
                    preſent, in ſo favourable a light, that they made no doubt of his ſoon regaining
                    his liberty, and being readmitted to his brother’s favour. The ſeeming
                    negociation, at laſt, went ſo proſperouſly on, that the duke gave his keepers a
                    kind of a farewell entertainment, previous to his obtaining a formal
                    deliverance; and they drank ſo immoderately, that being intoxicated, they gave
                    him an opportunity of eſcaping over the caſtle wall, by converting the ſheets of
                    his bed into a rope. Whoever knows the ſituation of that fortrefs, muſt be
                    amazed at the boldness of this attempt; and we are told that the duke’s valet,
                    the only domestic he was allowed to have, making the experiment before his
                    maſter, broke his neck: upon which the duke, lengthening the rape, slid down
                    unhurt; and carrying his fervant on his back to a place of ſafety, he went on
                    board a ſhip which his friends had provided, and eſcaped to France.</p>
                <p>In 1482, the king began to feel the bad conſequences of taking into his favour
                    men of worthleſs characters, which ſeems to have been one of this prince’s
                    pernicious foibles. His great favourite at this time was, Cochran, whom he had
                    railed to the dignity of earl of Mar. All hiſtorians agree that this man made a
                    moſt infamous uſe of his power. He obtained at laſt a liberty of coinage, which
                    he abused ſo much as to endanger an inſurrection among the poor people; ſor he
                    iſſued a baſe coin, called <hi rend="italic">black money</hi> by the common
                    people, which they resitſed to take in payments. This favourite’s ſkill in
                    architecture had ſirſt introduced him to James; but he maintained his power by
                    other arts: for, knowing that his maſter’s predominant paſſion was the love of
                    money, he procured it by the meaneſt and moſt oppreſſive methods. James,
                    however, was inclined to have relieved his people by calling in Cochran's money;
                    but he was diverted from that reſolution, by conſidering that it would be
                    agreeable to his old nobility. Beſides Cochran, James had other favourites whoſe
                    profeſſions rendered them ſtill leſs worthy of the royal countenance; James
                    Hommil a tavlor, Leonard a blackſmith, Torsifan a dancing-maſter, and ſome
                    others. The favour ſhown to theſe men gave ſo much offence to the nobility,
                    that, after ſome deliberation, they reſolved to remove the king, with ſome of
                    his leaſt exceptionable domeſtics (but without offering any violence to his
                    perſon) to the caſtle of Edinburgh; but to hang all his worthleſs favourites
                    over Lawder-bridge, the common place of execution. Their deliberation was not
                    kept so ſecret as not to come to the ears of the favourites; who ſuſpecting the
                    worſt, wakened James before day-break, and informed him of the meeting. He
                    ordered Cochran to repair to it, and to bring him an account of its
                        proceedings<note anchored="true" n="14" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>(L) Lindſay’s deſcription of this upſtart’s magnificence is very
                            particular, and may serve to give the reader an idea of the finery of
                            that age. “Cochran (says he), the earl of Mar, came from the king to the
                            council <pb n="793"/> (which council was holden in the kirk of
                            Lawder for the time), who was well accompanied with a band of men of
                            war, to the number of 300 light axes, all clad in white livery, and
                            black bends thereon, that they might be known for Cochran the earl of
                            Mar’s men. Himſelf was clad in a riding-pie of black velvet, with a
                            great chain of gold about his neck, to the value of 500 crowns; and four
                            blowing horns, with both the ends of gold and ſilk, ſet with precious
                            ſtones. His horn was tipped with fine gold at every end, and a precious
                            ſtone, called a <hi rend="italic">beryl,</hi> hanging in the midſt. This
                            Cochran had his heumont borne before him, overgilt with gold; ſo were
                            all the reſt of his horns; and all his pallions (pavilions or tents)
                            were of fine canvas of fill, and the cords thereof fine twined ſilk; and
                            the chains upon his pallions were double overgilt with gold.”</p></note>

                    information as to this event, Cochran rudely knocked at the door of the church,
                    juſt after the aſſembly had finiſhed their conſultation; and upon Sir Robert
                    Douglas of Lochleven (who was appointed to watch the door) informing them that
                    the earl of Mar demanded admittance, the earl of Angus ordered the door to be
                    thrown open; and ruſhing upon Cochran, he pulled a maſſy gold chain from his
                    neck, ſaying, that a rope would become him better; while Sir Robert Douglas
                    ſtripped him of a coſtly blowing horn he wore by his ſide, as was the manner of
                    the times, telling him he had been too long the hunter of miſchief. Cochran,
                    with aſtoniſhment, aſked them whether they were in jeſt or earneſt; but they
                    ſoon convinced him they were in earneſt, by pinioning down his arms with a
                    common halter till he ſhould be carried to execution.</p>
                <p>The earl of Angus, with ſome of the chief lords, attended by a detachment of
                    troops, then repaired to the king’s tent, where they ſeized his other
                    favourites, Thomas Preſton, Sir William Rogers, James Hommil, William Torfiſan,
                    and Leonard: and upbraided James himſelf, in very rude terms, with his
                    miſconduct in government, and even in private life, in not only being counſelled
                    by the above minions, but for keeping company with a lady who was called the <hi
                        rend="italic">Daiſy.</hi> We know of no reſiſtance made by James. He only
                    interceded for the ſafety of a young gentleman, one John Ramſay of Balmain.
                    Cochran, with his other worthleſs favourites, were hanged over Lawderbridge
                    before his eyes; and he himſelf was conducted, under an eaſy reſtraint, to the
                    caſtle of Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>James, though confined, behaved with great ſpirit; and even refuſed to pardon
                    thoſe who had confined him, or who had any hand in the execution at Lawder. At
                    laſt, however, he was relieved by the duke of Albany, who, at the queen’s
                    deſire, undertook to deliver her huſband from confinement. This he accompliſhed,
                    as ſome ſay, by ſurpriſing the caſtle of Edinburgh; though, according to others,
                    the gates were opened, upon a formal requiſition made ſo that purpoſe by two
                    heralds at arms. After he had obtained his liberty, the king repaired to the
                    abbey of Holyroodhouſe with his brother, who now acted as his firſt miniſter.
                    All the lords who were near the capital came to pay him their compliments; but
                    James was ſo much exaſperated at what had happened, that he committed 16 of them
                    priſoners to the caſtle of Edinburgh. After his releaſe, James granted a patent
                    to the citizens of Edinburgh, and enlarged their privileges.</p>
                <p>In 1487, James finiſhed ſome ſecret negociations in which he had engaged with
                    Henry king of England ſome time. The principal articles agreed on between the
                    two monarchs were, That king James’s ſecond ſon</p>
                <p>ſhould marry Catherine the third daughter of Edward IV. and ſiſter to the
                    princeſs Elizabeth, now queen of England; and that James himſelf, who was now a
                    widower, ſhould marry queen Elizabeth. A third marriage was alſo to be concluded
                    between the duke of Rotheſay and another daughter of Edward IV. That in order to
                    theſe treaties, and for ending all controverſies concerning the town of Berwick,
                    which the king of Scotland deſired ſo much to poſſeſs, a congreſs ſhould be held
                    the enſuing year.</p>
                <p>But in the mean time moſt powerful confederacy was formed againſt the king; the
                    origin of which was as follows. James was a threat patron of architecture; and
                    being pleaſed with the ſituation of Stirling caſtle, he reſolved to give it all
                    the embelliſhments which that art could beſtow; and about this time he made it
                    the chief place of his reſidence. He raiſed within it a hall, which at that time
                    was deemed a noble ſtructure; and a college, which he called the chapel-royal.
                    This college was endowed with an archdean who was a biſhop, a ſubdean, a
                    treaſurer, a chanter and ſubchanter, with a double ſet of other officers uſually
                    belonging to ſuch inſtitutions. The expences necessary for maintaining theſe
                    were conſiderable, and the king had reſolved to aſſign the revenues of the rich
                    priory of Coldingham for that purpoſe. This priory had been generally held by
                    one of the name of Hume; and that family, through length of time, conſidered it
                    as their property: they therefore ſtrongly oppoſed the king’s intention. The
                    diſpute ſeems to have laſted ſome years: for the former parliament had paſſed a
                    vote, annexing the priory to the king’s chapel-royal; and the parliament of this
                    year had paſſed a ſtatute, ſtrictly prohibiting all perſons, ſpiritual and
                    temporal, to attempt any thing, directly or indirectly, contrary or prejudicial
                    to the ſaid union and annexation. The Humes reſented their being ſtripped of ſo
                    gainful a revenue, the loſs of which affected moſt of the gentlemen of that
                    name; and they united themſelves with the Hepburns, another powerful clan in
                    that neighbourhood, under the lord Hales. An aſſociation was ſoon formed; by
                    which both families engaged to ſtand by each other, and not to ſuffer any prior
                    to be received for Coldingham, if he was not of one of their ſurnames. The lords
                    Gray and Drummond ſoon joined the aſſociation; as did many other noblemen and
                    gentlemen, who had their particular cauſes of diſcontent. Their agents gave out,
                    that the king was graſping at arbitrary power; that he had acquired his
                    popularity by deep hypocriſy; and that he was reſolved to be ſignally revenged
                    upon all who had any hand in the execution at Lawder. The earl of Angus, who was
                    the ſoul of the confederacy, adviſed the conſpirators to apply to the old earl
                    of Douglas to head them: but that nobleman was now dead to all ambition, and
                        inſtead<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0800.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0794"/> of
                    encouraging the conſpirators, he pathetically exhorted them to break off all
                    their rebellious connections, and return to their duty; expreſſing the moſt
                    ſincere contrition for his own paſt conduct. Finding he could not prevail with
                    them, he wrote to all the numerous friends and deſcendants of his family, and
                    particularly to Douglas of Cavers, ſheriff of Teviotdale, diſſuading them from
                    entering into the conſpiracy; and ſome oſ his original letters to that effect
                    are ſaid to be ſtill extant. That great man ſurvived this application but a
                    ſhort time; for he died without iſſue at Lindores, on the 15th of April 1488;
                    and in him ended the ſirſt branch of that noble and illuſtrious houſe. He was
                    remarkable for being the moſt learned of all the Scots nobility, and for the
                    comelineſs of his perſon.</p>
                <p>James appears to have been no ſtranger to the proceedings of the conſpirators:
                    but though he dreaded them, he depended upon the protection of the law, as they
                    did upon his puſillanimity. His degeneracy in this reſpect is remarkable.
                    Descended from a race of heroes, he was the firſt of his family who had been
                    branded with cowardice. But his conduct at this time fully juſtifies the charge.
                    Inſtead of vigorouſly ſupporting the execution of the laws in his own perſon, he
                    ſhut himſelf up in his beloved caſtle of Stirling, and raiſed a body guard; the
                    command of which he gave to the lord Bothwel, maſter of his houſehold. He
                    likewiſe iſſued a proclamation, forbidding any perſon in arms to approach the
                    court; and Bothwel had a warrant to ſee the ſame put into execution. Though the
                    king’s proceedings in all this were perfectly agreeable to law, yet they were
                    given out by his enemies as ſo many indications of his averſion to the nobility,
                    and ſerved only to induce them to parade, armed, about</p>
                <p>the country in more numerous bodies.</p>
                <p>The connections entered into by James with Henry alarmed the conſpirators, and
                    made them reſolve to ſtrike the great blow before James could avail himſelf of
                    an alliance that ſeemed to place him above all oppoſition either abroad or at
                    home. The acquiſition of Berwick to the crown of Scotland, which was looked upon
                    to be as good as concluded; the marriage of the duke of Rotheſay with the
                    daughter of the dowager and ſiſter to the confort queen of England; and, above
                    all, the ſtrict harmony which reigned between James and the ſtates of his
                    kingdom, rendered the conſpirators in a manner deſperate. Beſides the earl of
                    Angus, the earls of Argyle and Lenox favoured the conſpirators; for when the
                    whole of James’s convention with England is conſidered, and compared with
                    after-events, nothing can be more plain, than that the ſucceſs of the
                    conſpirators was owing to his Engliſh connections; and that they made uſe of
                    them to affirm, that Scotland was ſoon to become a province of England, and that
                    James intended to govern his ſubjects by an Engliſh force.— Thoſe ſpecious
                    allegations did the conſpirators great ſervice, and inclined many, even of the
                    moderate party, to their cauſe. They ſoon took the field, appointed their
                    rendezvouſes, and all the ſouth of Scotland was in arms. James continued to rely
                    upon the authority of his parliament; and ſummoned, in the terms of law, the
                    inſurgents to anſwer at the proper tribunals for their repeated breaches of the
                    peace. The conſpirators, far from paying any regard to his citations, tore them
                    in pieces, buffeted and otherwiſe maltreated the meſſengers, and ſet the laws of
                    therr country at open defiance. Even north of the Forth, the heads of the houſes
                    of Gray and Drummond ſpread the ſpirit of diſaffection through the populous
                    counties of Fife and Angus; but the counties north of the Grampians continued
                    firm in their duty.</p>
                <p>The duke of Rotheſay was then a promiſing youth about fifteen years of age; and
                    the ſubjecting the kingdom of Scotland to that of England being the chief, if
                    not the only cauſe urged by the rebels for their appearing in arms, they
                    naturally threw their eyes upon that prince, as his appearance at their head
                    would give ſtrength and vigour to their cauſe; and in this they were not
                    deceived. James, in the mean time, finding the inhabitants of the ſouthern
                    provinces were either engaged in the rebellion or at beſt obſerved a cold
                    neutrality, embarked on board of a veſſel which was then lying in the frith of
                    Forth, and paſſed to the north of that river, not finding it ſafe to go by land
                    to Stirling. Arriving at the caſtle, he gave orders that the duke of Rotheſay
                    (as foreſeeing what afterwards happened) ſhould be put under the care of one
                    Schaw of Sauchie, whom he had made its governor, charging him not to ſuffer the
                    prince upon any account to depart out of the fort. The rebels giving out that
                    James had fled to Flanders plundered his equipages and baggage before they
                    paſſed the Forth; and they there found a large ſum of money, which proved to be
                    of the utmoſt conſequence to their affairs. They then ſurpriſed the caſtle of
                    Dunbar, and plundered the houſes of every man to the ſouth of the Forth whom
                    they ſuſpected to be a royaliſt.</p>
                <p>James was all this time making a progreſs, and holding courts of juſtice, in the
                    north, where the great families were entirely devoted to his ſervice,
                    particularly the earls of Huntley, Errol, and Marſhal.— Every day brought him
                    freſh alarms from the ſouth, which left him no farther room either for delay or
                    deliberation. The conſpirators, notwithſtanding the promiſing appearance of
                    their affairs, found, that in a ſhort time their cauſe muſt languiſh, and their
                    numbers dwindle, unleſs they were furniſhed with freſh pretexts, and headed by a
                    perſon of the greateſt authority. While they were deliberating who that perſon
                    ſhould be, the earl of Angus boldly propoſed the duke of Rotheſay and an
                    immediate application was made to Schaw, the young prince’s governor, who
                    ſecretly favoured their cauſe, and was prevailed upon by a conſiderable ſum of
                    money to put the prince into their hands, and to declare for the rebels.</p>
                <p>James having ordered all the force in the north to aſſemble, hurried to Perth
                    (then called St John’s town), where he appointed the rendezvous of his army,
                    which amounted to 30,000 men. Among the other noblemen who attended him was the
                    famous lord David Lindſay of the Byres (an officer of great courage and
                    experience, having long ſerved in foreign countries), who headed 3000 foot and
                    1000 horſe, moſtly raiſed in Fifeſhire. Upon his approaching the king’s perſon,
                    he preſented him with a horſe of remarkable ſpirit and beauty, and informed his
                    majeſty, that he might truſt his life to his agility and ſure-footedneſs. The
                    lord Ruthven, who was ſheriff of Strathern, and anceſtor (if we miſtake not) to
                    the unfortunate earls of Gowry, joined James at the head of 3000 well armed
                        men.—<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0801.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0795"/> The
                    whole army being aſſembled, James proceeded to Stirling; but he was aſtoniſhed,
                    when he was not only denied entrance into the caſtle, but ſaw the guns pointed
                    againſt his perſon, and underſtood, for the firſt time, that his ſon was at the
                    head of the rebels. Schaw pretended that the duke of Rotheſay had been carried
                    off againſt his will: but the king's anſwer was, “Fye, traitor, thou haſt
                    deceived me; and if I live I ſhall be revenged on thee, and thou ſhalt be
                    rewarded as thou haſt ſerved.” James lay that night in the town of Stirling,
                    where he was joined by all his army; and underſtanding that the rebels were
                    advancing, he formed his line of battle. The earl of Athol his uncle, who was
                    truſted by both parties, propoſed an accommodation; which was accordingly
                    effected, if we are to believe Abercromby and other hiſtorians; but we know not
                    the terms, for none are mentioned on either fide. — James is ſaid to have failed
                    on his part; but had there been any grounds for ſuch a charge againſt him, there
                    can ſcarcely be a doubt but that the rebels would have publiſhed them. That a
                    treaty was entered into is paſt diſpute; and the earl of Athol ſurrendered
                    himſelf as a hoſtage into the hands of the rebels.</p>
                <p>James was ſenſible of the advantage which public clamour gave to his enemies; and
                    he applied to the kings of France and England, and the pope, for their
                    interpoſition. His holineſs named Adrian de Caſtello for his nuncio on that
                    occaſion; and the two kings threatened to raiſe troops for the ſervice of
                    James.— He, by a fatality not uncommon to weak princes, left the ſtrong caſtle
                    of Edinburgh, where he might have been in ſafety till his friends, who had
                    diſperſed themſelves upon the faith of the late negociation, could be
                    reaſſembled; and croſſing the Forth, he made another attempt to be admitted into
                    the caſtle of Stirling; but was diſappointed, and informed that the rebels were
                    at Torwood in the neighbourhood, and ready to give him battle. He was in
                    poſſeſſion of the caſtle of Blackneſs; his admiral, Wood, commanded the Forth;
                    and his loyal ſubjects in the north were upon their march to join him.
                    Hawthornden ſays, that the rebels had made a (bow of diſmiſſing their troops,
                    that they might draw James into the field; and that while he remained at
                    Blackneſs, he was attended by the earls of Montroſe, Glencairn, and the lords
                    Maxwell and Ruthven. To give his northern troops time to join him, he propoſed a
                    negociation; but that was ſoon at an end, upon the rebels peremptorily requiring
                    him to reſign his crown to his ſon, that is, to themſelves.</p>
                <p>The rebels had been inured to war. They conſiſted chiefly of borderers, well
                    armed and diſciplined; in which they had the advantage of the king’s Lowland
                    ſubjects, who had not been accuſtomed to arms. What the numbers on both ſides
                    were does not clearly appear but it is probable that the forces of James were
                    ſuperior to the rebels. They were then at Falkirk; but they ſoon paſſed the
                    Carron, encamped above the bridge near Torwood, and made ſuch diſpositions as
                    rendered a battle unavoidable, unleſs James would have diſperſed his army, and
                    gone on board Wood’s ſhips: but he did not know himſelf, and reſolved on a
                    battle. He was encamped at a ſimall brook named Sauchieburn, near the ſame ſpot
                    of ground where the great Bruce had defeated the Engliſh under Edward the
                    ſecond. The earl of Menteith, the lords</p>
                <p>Erſkine, Graham, Ruthven, and Maxwell, commanded the firſt line of the king's
                    army. The ſecond was commanded by the earl of Glencairn, who was at the head of
                    the Weſtland and Highland men. The earl of Crawford, with the lord Boyd and
                    Lindſay of Byres, commanded the rear, wherein the king’s main ſtrength
                    conliſted, and where he himſelf appeared in perſon, completely armed, and
                    mounted upon the fine horſe which had been preſented to him by Lindſay.</p>
                <p>The firſt line of the royaliſts obliged that of the rebels to give way; but the
                    latter being ſupported by the Annandale men and borderers, the firſt and ſecond
                    line of the king s army were beat back to the third. The little courage James
                    poſſeſſed had forſaken him at the firſt onſet; and he had put ſpurs to his
                    horſe, intending to gain the banks of the Forth, and to go on board one of
                    Wood’s ſhips. In paſſing through the village of Bannockburn, a woman who was
                    filling her pitcher at the brook, frightened at the fight of a man in armour
                    galloping full ſpeed, left it behind her; and the horſe taking fright, the king
                    was thrown to the ground, and carried, bruiſed and maimed, by a miller and his
                    wife, into their hovel. He immediately called for a prieſt to make his
                    confeſſion; and the ruſtics demanding his name and rank, “I was (ſaid he
                    incautiouſly) your king this morning.” The woman, overcome with aſtoniſhment,
                    clapped her hands, and running to the door called for a prieſt to confeſs the
                    king. I am a prieſt (ſaid one paſſing by), lead me to his majeſty.” Being
                    introduced into the hovel, he ſaw the king covered with a coarſe cloth; and
                    kneeling by him, he aſked James whether he thought he could recover, if properly
                    attended by phyſicians? James anſwering in the affirmative, the villain pulled
                    out a dagger, and ſtabbed him to the heart. Such is the dark account we are able
                    to give of this prince’s unhappy end. The name of the perſon who murdered him is
                    ſaid to have been Sir Andrew Borthwick, a prieſt, one of the pope’s knights.
                    Some pretend that the lord Gray, and others that Robert Stirling of Keir, was
                    the regicide; and even Buchanan (the tenor of whoſe hiſtory is a juſtifiation of
                    this murder), is uncertain as to the name of the perſon who gave him the fatal
                    blow.</p>
                <p>It is probable that the royaliſts loſt the battle thro’ the cowardice of James.
                    Even after his flight his troops fought bravely; but they were damped on
                    receiving the certain accounts of his death. The prince, young as he was, had an
                    idea of the unnatural part he was acting, and before the battle he had given a
                    ſtrict charge for the ſafety of his father’s perſon. Upon hearing that he had
                    retired from the field, he ſent orders that none ſhould purſue him; but they
                    were ineffectual, the rebels being ſenſible that they could have no ſafety but
                    in the king’s death. When that was certified, hoſtilities ſeemed to ceaſe; nor
                    were the royaliſts purſued. The number of ſlain on both ſides is uncertain; but
                    it must have been conſiderable, as the earl of Glencairn, the lords Sempil,
                    Erſkine, and Ruthven, and other gentlemen of great eminence, are mentioned. As
                    to the duke of Rotheſay, who was now king, he appeared inconſolable when he
                    heard of his father's death; but the rebels endeavoured to efface his grief, by
                    the profuſion of honours they paid him when he was recognized as king.</p>
                <p>The remorſe and anguiſh of the young king, on re-<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0802.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0796"/> flecting upon
                    the unnatural part he had acted, was inexpreſſible; and the noblemen who had
                    been engaged in the rebellion became apprehenſive for their own ſafety. The
                    cataſtrophe of the unfortunate James III. however, was not yet become public;
                    and it was thought by many that he had gone aboard ſome of the ſhips belonging
                    to the Scottiſh admiral Sir Andrew Wood. James, willing to indulge hope as long
                    as it was poſſible, deſired an interview with the admiral; but the latter
                    refuſed to come on ſhore, unleſs he had ſufficient hoſtages for his ſafety.
                    Theſe being delivered, Sir Andrew waited upon the king at Leith. He had again
                    and again, by meſſages, aſſured him that he knew nothing of the late king; and
                    he had even offered to allow his ſhips to be ſearched: yet ſuch was the anxiety
                    of the new king, that he could not be ſatisfied till he had examined him in
                    perſon. Young James had been long a ſtranger to his father, ſo that he could not
                    have diſtinguiſhed him ealily from others. When Wood, therefore, entered the
                    room, being ſtruck with his noble appearance, he aſked him, “Are you my father?”
                    “I am not,” replied Wood, burſting into tears ; “but I was your father’s true
                    ſervant, and while I live I ſhall be the determined enemy of his murderers.”
                    This did not ſatisfy the lords, who demanded whether he knew where the king was.
                    The admiral replied, that he knew not; and upon their queſtioning him concerning
                    his manœuvres on the day of battle, when his boats were ſeen plying backwards
                    and forwards, he told them, that he and his brother had determined to aſſiſt the
                    king in perſon; but all they could do was to ſave ſome of the royaliſts in their
                    ſhips. “I would to God, (ſays he), my king was there ſafely, for I would defend
                    and keep him ſkaithleſs from all the traitors who have cruelly murdered him: for
                    I think to ſee the day to behold them hanged and drawn for their demerits.” This
                    ſpirited declaration, and the freedom with which it was delivered, ſtruck the
                    guilty part of the council with diſmay; but the fear of ſacriſicing the hoſtages
                    procured Wood his freedom, and he was ſuffered to depart to his ſhips. When he
                    came on board, he found his brother preparing to hang the two lords who had been
                    left as hoſtages; which would certainly have been their fate, had the admiral
                    been longer detained.</p>
                <p>Wood had ſcarcely reached his ſhips, when the lords, calling the inhabitants of
                    Leith together, offered them a large premium if they would fit out a ſufficient
                    force to deſtroy that bold pirate and his crew, as they called Wood; but the
                    townſmen, who, it ſeems, did not much care for the ſervice, replied, that Wood’s
                    ſhips were a match for any ten ſhips that could be fitted out in Scotland. The
                    council then removed to Edinburgh, where James IV. was crowned on the 24th of
                    June 1487.</p>
                <p>In the month of October this year, the nobility and others who had been preſent
                    at the king’s coronation, converted themſelves into a parliament, and paſſed an
                    act by which they were indemnified for their rebellion againſt their late
                    ſovereign; after which, they ordered the act to be exemplified under the great
                    ſeal of Scotland, that it might be producible in their juſtification if called
                    for by any foreign prince. They next proceeded to the arduous taſk of
                    vindicating their rebellion in the eyes of the public; and ſo far did they gain
                    upon the king by the force of flattery, that he contented to ſummon the lords
                    who had taken part with his father, before the parliament, to anſwer for their
                    conduct. In conſequence of this, no fewer than 28 lords were cited to appear at
                    Edinburgh in the ſpace of 40 days. The firſt upon the liſt was the lord David
                    Lindſay, whoſe form of arraignment was as follows. “Lord David Lindſay of the
                    Byres, anſwer for the cruel coming againſt the king at Bannockburn with his
                    father, giving him counſel to have devoured the king’s grace here preſent; and,
                    to that effect, gave him a ſword and a good horſe, to fortify him againſt his
                    ſon. Your anſwer hereto.” Lord Lindſay was remarkable for the bluntneſs of his
                    converſation and the freedom of his ſentiments; and being irritated by this
                    charge, he delivered himſelf in ſuch a manner concerning the treaſon of the
                    rebellious lords, as abaſhed the boldeſt of his accuſers. As they were unable to
                    anſwer him, all they could do was to preſs him to throw himſelf upon the king’s
                    clemency; which he refuſed, as being guilty of no crime. His brother, Patrick
                    Lindſay, undertook to be his advocate, and apologized upon his knees for the
                    roughneſs of his behaviour, and at laſt obſerved an informality in the
                    proceedings of the court; in conſequence of which Lindſay was released, upon
                    entering into recognizance to appear again at an appointed day: however, he was
                    afterwards ſent priſoner by the king’s order, for a whole twelvemonth, to the
                    caſtle of Rotheſay in the Iſle of Bute. ∣</p>
                <p>The regicides now endeavoured to gain the public favour by affecting a ſtrict
                    adminiſtration of juſtice. The king was adviſed to make a progreſs round the
                    kingdom, attended by his council and judges; while, in the mean time, certain
                    noblemen and gentlemen were appointed to exercite juſtice, and to ſuppreſs all
                    kinds of diſorders in their own lands and in thoſe adjoining to them, till the
                    king came to the age of 21. The memory of the late king was branded in the moſt
                    opprobrious manner. All juſtices, ſheriffs, and ſtewards, who were poſſeſſed of
                    heritable offices, but who had taken up arms for the late king, were either
                    deprived of them for three years, or rendered incapable of enjoying them for
                    ever after. All the young nobility who had been diſinherited by their fathers
                    for taking arms againſt the late king, were, by act of parliament, reſtored to
                    their ſeveral ſucceſſions in the moſt ample manner. At laſt, in order to give a
                    kind of proof to the world that they intended only to reſettle the ſtate of the
                    nation, without prejudice to the lower ranks of ſubjects, who did no more than
                    follow the examples of their ſuperiors, it was enacted, “That all goods and
                    effects taken from burgeſſes, merchants, and thoſe who had only perſonal
                    eſtates, or, as they are called, <hi rend="italic">un landed men,</hi> ſince the
                    battle of Stirling, were not only to be reſtored, but the owners were to be
                    indemnified for their losses; and their perſons, if in cuſtody, were to be ſet
                    at liberty. Churchmen, who were taken in arms, were to be delivered over to
                    their ordinances, to be dealt with by them according to the law.” The caſtle of
                    Dunbar was ordered to be demolished; and ſome ſtatutes were enacted in favour of
                    commerce, and for the</p>
                <p>exclusion of foreigners.</p>
                <p>Theſe laſt acts were paſſed with a view to recompence the boroughs, who had been
                    very active in their oppoſition to the late king. However, the lords, before
                    they diſſolved their parliament, thought it neceſſa-<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0803.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0797"/> ry to give
                    some public teſtimony of their diſapproving the late king’s connection with
                    England. It was therefore enacted, “That as the king was now of an age to marry
                    a noble princeſs, <hi rend="italic">born and defended of a noble and worshiρful
                        houſe;</hi> an honourable embaſſy ſhould be ſent to the realms of France,
                    Brittany, Spain, and other places, in order to conclude the matter.” This
                    embaſſy was to be very ſplendid. It was to conſiſt of a biſhop, an earl, or lord
                    of parliament, a ſecretary, who was generally a clergyman, and a knight. They
                    were to be attended by 50 horſemen; 5000 l. was to be allowed them for the
                    diſcharge of their embaſſy, and they were empowered to renew the ancient league
                    between France and Scotland; and, in the mean time, a herald, or, as he was
                    called, a <hi rend="italic">trusty squire,</hi> was ſent abroad to viſit the
                    ſeveral courts of Europe, in order to find out a proper match for the king. One
                    conſiderable obſtacle, however, lay in the way of this embaſſy. The pope had
                    laid under an interdict all thoſe who had appeared in arms againſt the late
                    king; and the party who now governed Scotland were looked upon by all the powers
                    of Europe as rebels and murderers. The embaſſy was therefore ſuſpended for a
                    conliderable time; for it was not till the year 1491 that the pope could be
                    prevailed upon to take off the interdict, upon the moſt humble ſubmiſſions and
                    profeſſions of repentance made by the guilty parties.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the many good qualities which diſcovered themſelves in the
                    young king began to conciliate the affections of his people to him. Being
                    conſidered, however, as little better than a priſoner in the hands of his
                    father’s murderers, ſeveral of the nobility made uſe of that as a pretence for
                    taking arms. The moſt forward of theſe was the earl of Lenox, who with 2000 men
                    attempted to ſurpriſe the town of Stirling; but, being betrayed by one of his
                    own men, he was defeated, taken unawares, and the caſtle of Dumbarton, of which
                    he was the keeper, taken by the oppoſite party. In the north, the earls of
                    Huntley and Marſhal, with the Lord Forbes, complained that they had been
                    deceived, and declared their reſolution to revenge the late king’s death. Lord
                    Forbes having procured the bloody ſhirt of the murdered prince, diſplayed it on
                    the point of a lance, as a banner under which all loyal ſubjects ſhould lift
                    themſelves. However, after the defeat of Lenox, the northern chieftains found
                    themſelves incapable of marching ſouthwards, and were therefore obliged to
                    abandon their enterpriſe. The cauſe of the murdered king was next undertaken by
                    Henry VII. of England, who made an offer to Sir Andrew Wood of five ſhips to
                    revenge it. The admiral accepted the propoſal; but the Engliſh behaving as
                    pirates, and plundering indiſcriminately all who came in their way, he thought
                    proper to ſeparate himſelf from them, yet without offering to attack or oppoſe
                    them. Upon this, James was adviſed to ſend for the admiral, to offer him a
                    pardon, and a commiſſion to act againſt the Engliſh freebooters. Wood accepted
                    of the king’s offer; and being well provided with ammunition and artillery, he,
                    with two ſhips only, attacked the five Engliſh veſſels, all of which he took,
                    and brought their crews priſoners to Leith, for which he was nobly rewarded by
                    his majeſty.</p>
                <p>This conduct of Wood was highly reſented by the king of England, who immediately
                    vowed revenge. The Scottiſh admiral’s ſhips had been fitted out for commerce as
                    well as war, and Henry commanded his beſt ſea-officer, Sir Stephen Bull, to
                    intercept him on his return from. Flanders, whither he had gone upon a
                    commercial voyage. Wood had no more than two ſhips with him: the Engliſh admiral
                    had three; and thoſe much larger, and carrying a greater weight of metal, than
                    the Scottiſh veſſels. The Engliſh took their ſtation at the iſland of May, in
                    the mouth of the Frith of Forth, and, having come unawares upon their enemies,
                    fired two guns as a ſignal for their ſurrendering themſelves. The Scottiſh
                    commander encouraged his men as well as he could; and finding them determined to
                    ſtand by him to the laſt, began the engagement in fight of numberleſs ſpectators
                    who appeared on both ſides of the frith. The fight continued all that day, and
                    was renewed with redoubled fury in the morning; but, in the mean time, the
                    ebb-tide and a ſouth wind had carried both ſquadrons to the mouth of the Tay.
                    Here the Engliſh fought under great diſadvantages, by reaſon of the ſand-banks;
                    and before they could get clear oſ them, all the three were obliged to ſubmit to
                    the Scots, who carried them to Dundee. Wood treated his priſoners with great
                    humanity; and having afterwards preſented them to King James, the latter
                    diſmiſſed them not only without ranſom, but with preſents to the officers and
                    crews, and a letter to King Henry. To this Henry returned a polite anſwer, a
                    truce was concluded, and all differences for the preſent were accommodated.</p>
                <p>James all this time had continued to diſplay ſuch moderation in his government,
                    and appeared to have the advantage of his ſubjects ſo much at heart, that they
                    became gradually well affected to his government, and in 1490 all parties were
                    fully reconciled. We may from thence date the commencement of the reign of James
                    IV.; and the next year the happineſs of his kingdom was completed, by taking off
                    the pope’s interdict, and giving the king abſolution for the hand he had in his
                    father’s death.</p>
                <p>Tranquillity being thus reſtored, the negociations concerning the king’s marriage
                    began to take place, but met with ſeveral interruptions. In 1493, Henry VII.
                    propoſed a match between the king of Scotland and his couſin the princeſs
                    Catharine. James was too much attached to France to be fond of Engliſh
                    connections, and probably thought this match below his dignity; in conſequence
                    of which the propoſal was treated with contempt. However, notwithſtanding this
                    ill ſucceſs, Henry made another offer of alliance with James; and, in 1495,
                    propoſed a marriage betwixt him and his eldeſt daughter Margaret. This propoſal
                    was accepted: but the match ſeems not to have been at all agreeable to James;
                    for, at the very time in which he was negociating the marriage, he not only
                    protected Perkin Warbeck, the avowed enemy and pretender to the crown of Henry,
                    but invaded England on his account. This conduct was highly reſented by the
                    Engliſh parliament; but Henry himſelf forgave even this groſs insult, and the
                    marriage negociations were once more reſumed. The bride was no more than ten
                    years and ſix months old; and being only the fourth degree of blood from James,
                    it was neceſſary to procure a diſpenſation from the pope. This being obtained, a
                    treaty of perpetual peace was concluded between the two<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0804.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0798"/> nations, on
                    the 1ſt of July 1503, being the firſt that had taken place for 170 years, ſince
                    the peace of Northampton, concluded between Robert I and Edward III.</p>
                <p>One of the great ends which Henry had in view in promoting this marriage, was to
                    detach James from the French intereſt: no ſooner, therefore, was the treaty
                    ſigned, than he wrote to his ſon-in-law to this purpoſe; who, however, politely
                    declined to break with his ancient ally. On the 16th of June, the royal bride
                    ſet out from Richmond in Surry, in company with her father, who gave her the
                    convoy as far as Colleweſton, the residence of his mother the counteſs of
                    Richmond. After paſſing ſome days there, the king reſigned his daughter to the
                    care of the earls of Surry and Northumberland, who proceeded with her to the
                    borders of Scotland. Here a number of the company were permitted to take their
                    leave; but thoſe who remained ſtill made a royal appearance. At Lamberton church
                    they were met by James, attended by a numerous train of his nobility and
                    officers of ſtate. From Lamberton they proceeded to Dalkeith, and next day to
                    Edinburgh; where the nuptials were celebrated with the greateſt ſplendor. On
                    this occaſion, it is ſaid that the Scots ſurpaſſed all their gueſts in
                    extravagance and luxury: which muſt have been owing to the great intercourſe and
                    commerce which James and his ſubjects maintained with foreign courts and
                    countries.</p>
                <p>After the celebration of the nuptials, James appears to have enjoyed a
                    tranquillity unknown almoſt to any of his predeceſſors; and began to make a
                    conſiderable figure among the European potentates. But the magnificence of his
                    court and embaſſies, his liberality to ſtrangers and to learned men, his coſtly
                    edifices, and, above all, the large ſums he laid out in ſhip building, had now
                    brought him into ſome difficulties; and he ſo far attended to the advice and
                    example of his father-in- law, that he ſupplied his neceſſities by reviving
                    dormant penal laws, particularly with regard to wardſhips and old titles of
                    eſtates, by which he raiſed large ſums. Though he did this without aſſembling
                    his parliament,</p>
                <p>yet he found agents who juſtified thoſe proceedings, in the ſame manner as Epſon
                    and Dudley did thoſe of Henry, under the fonction of law. At laſt, however,
                    touched with the ſufferings of his ſubjects, he ordered all proſecutions to be
                    ſtopped. He even went farther: for, ſenſible of the deteſtation into which his
                    father- in-law’s avarice had brought himſelf and his adminiſtration, he ordered
                    the miniſters who had adviſed him to thoſe ſhameful courſes to be impriſoned;
                    and ſome of them, who probably had exceeded their commiſſion, actually died in
                    their confinement.</p>
                <p>About this time, James applied himſelf, with incredible aſſiduity, to the budding
                    of ſhips; one of which, the St Michael, is ſuppoſed to have been the largeſt
                    then in the world<note anchored="true" n="15" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                                ><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(μ</hi>) Of this ſhip we have the following
                            account by Lindſay of Pitſcottie. “In the ſame year, the king of
                            Scotland bigged a great ſhip, called the <hi rend="italic">Great
                                Michael,</hi> which was the greateſt ſhip, and of moſt ſtrength,
                            that ever ſailed in England or France. For this ſhip was of ſo great
                            ſtature, and took ſo much timber, that, except Falkland, ſhe wafted all
                            the woods in Fife, which was oak-wood, by all timber that was gotten out
                            of Norway; for ſhe was ſo ſtrong, and of ſo great length and breadth
                            (all the wrights of Scotland, yea, and many other ſtrangers, were at her
                            device, by the king’s commandment, who wrought very buſily in her; but
                            it was a year and day ere ſhe was complete); to wit, ſhe was twelve
                            ſcore foot of length, and thirty-ſix foot within the ſides. She was ten
                            foot thick in the wall, outted jeſts of oak in her wall, and boards on
                            every ſide, ſo ſtark and ſo thick, that no cannon could go through her.
                            This great ſhip cumbered Scotland to get her to the ſea. From that time
                            that ſhe was afloat, and her maſts and foils complete, with tows and
                            anchors effeiring thereto, ſhe was counted to the king to be thirty
                            thouſand pounds of expences, by her artillery, which was very great and
                            coſtly to the king, by all the reft of her orders; to wit, ſhe bare many
                            cannons, ſix on every ſide, with three great baſſils, two behind in her
                            dock, and one before, with three hundred ſhot of ſmall artillery, that
                            is to ſay, myand and battret-falcon, and quarter-falcon, ſlings,
                            peſtelent ſerpetens, and double-dogs, with hagtor and culvering,
                            cors-bows and hand-bows. She had three hundred mariners to ſail her; ſhe
                            had ſix ſcore of gunners to uſe her artillery; and had a thouſand men of
                            war, by her captain, ſhippers, and quarter-maſters.</p><p>“When this
                            ſhip paſt to the ſea, and was lying in the road, the king gart ſhoot a

                            her not, and did her little ſkaith. And if any man believe that this

                    it is plain, from his conduct, that he was aſpiring to be a maritime power, in
                    which he was encouraged by the excellent ſeamen which Scotland then produced.
                    The firſt eſſay of his arms by ſea was in favour of his kinſman John king of
                    Denmark. This prince was brother to Margaret queen of Scotland; and had partly
                    been called to the throne of Sweden, and partly poſſeſſed it by force. He was
                    oppoſed by the adminiſtrator, Sture, whom he pardoned after he was crowned.
                    Sture, however, renewing his rebellion, and the Norwegians revolting at the ſome
                    time, John found himſelf under ſuch difficulties, that he was forced to return
                    to Denmark; but he left his queen in poſſeſſion of the caſtle of Stockholm,
                    which ſhe bravely defended againſt Sture and the Swedes. This heroic princeſs
                    became a great favourite with James; and ſeveral letters that paſſed between
                    them are ſtill extant. The king of Denmark, next to the French monarch, was the
                    favourite ally of James; who, early in his reign, had compromiſed ſome
                    differences between them. It likewiſe appears, from the hiſtories of the north,
                    that both James and his father had given great affiſtance to his Daniſh majeſty
                    in reducing the Norwegians; and he reſolved to become a party in the war againſt
                    the Swedes, and the Lubeckers who aſſiſted them, if the<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196389_0805.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0799"/> former
                    continued in their revolt. Previous to this, he ſent an ambaſſador to offer his
                    mediation between John and his ſubjects. The mediation was accordingly accepted
                    of, and the negociations were opened at Calmar. The deputies of Sweden not
                    attending, John prevailed with thoſe of Denmark and Norway to pronounce ſentence
                    of forfeiture againſt Sture and all his adherents. In the mean time, the ſiege
                    of the caſtle of Stockholm was ſo warmly preſſed. that the garriſon was
                    diminiſhed to a handful, and thoſe deſtitute of all kind of proviſions; ſo that
                    the brave queen was forced to capitulate, and to ſurrender up the fortreſs, on
                    condition that ſhe would be ſuffered to depart for Denmark; but the capitulation
                    was pertidiouſly broken by Sture, and ſhe was confined in a monaſtery.</p>
                <p>It was on this occaſion that James reſolved to employ his maritime power. He
                    wrote a letter, conceived in the ſtrongeſt terms, to the archbiſhop of Upſal,
                    the primate of Sweden, exhorting him to employ all his authority in favour of
                    the king; and another letter to the Lubeckers, threatening to declare war
                    againſt them, as well as the Swedes, if they jointly continued to aſſiſt the
                    rebels. According to Hollinſhed, James, in conſequence of king John’s
                    application, gave the command of an army of 10,000 men to the earl of Arran, who
                    replaced John upon his throne. Though this does not ſtrictly appear to be truth,
                    yet it is certain, that, had it not been for James, John muſt have ſunk under
                    the weight of his enemies. Sture, whoſe arms had made great progreſs, hearing
                    that a conſiderable armament was fitting out in Scotland, and knowing that James
                    had prevailed with the French king to aſſiſt John likewiſe, agreed to releaſe
                    the queen, and to conduct her to the frontiers of Denmark; where he died. By
                    this time, James’s armament, which was commanded by the earl of Arran, had ſet
                    ſail; but perceiving that all matters were adjuſted between John and the Swedes,
                    the ſhips returned ſooner than James expected, “which (ſays he, in a very polite
                    letter he wrote to the queen upon the occaſion) they durſt not have done, had
                    they not brought me an account that her Daniſh majeſty was in perfect health and
                    ſafety.” The severity of John having occaſioned a freſh revolt, James again ſent
                    a ſquadron to his aſſiſtance, which appeared before Stockholm, and obliged the
                    Lubeckers to conclude a new treaty.</p>
                <p>James, having thus honourably diſcharged his engagements with his uncle the king
                    of Denmark, turned his attention towards the Flemings and Hollanders, who had
                    inſulted his flag, on account of the aſſiſtance he had afforded the duke of
                    Gueldres, as well as from motives of rapaciousness, which diſtinguiſhed thoſe
                    traders, who are ſaid not only to have plundered the Scots ſhips, but to have
                    thrown their crews overboard to conceal their villany. James gave the command of
                    a ſquadron to Barton; who put to ſea, and, without any ceremony, treated all the
                    Dutch and Flemiſh traders who fell into his hands as pirates, and ſent their
                    heads in hogſheads to James. Soon after, Barton returned to Scotland, and
                    brought with him a number of rich prizes, which rendered his reputation as a
                    ſeaman famous all over Europe.—James was then ſo much reſpected upon the
                    continent, that we know of no reſentment ſhown</p>
                <p>either by the court of Spain, whoſe ſubjects thole Netherlanders were, or of any
                    other power in Europe, for this vigorous proceeding.</p>
                <p>The peace with England continued all the time of Henry VII. nor did his ſon Henry
                    VIII. though he had not the ſame reaſon as his father to keep well with the
                    Scots, for ſome time ſhew any diſpoſition to break with them. A breach, however,
                    did very ſoon take place, which was never afterwards thoroughly made up.</p>
                <p>About 30 years before, one John Barton (a relation, probably, to the famous
                    Barton) commanded a trading veſſel, which was taken by two Portugueſe ſea-
                    captains in the port of Sluys; and the captain, with ſeveral Scotchmen, were
                    killed in endeavouring to defend their property. The action was eſteemed
                    cowardly as well as piratical, becauſe it was done under the protection of a
                    large Portugueſe ſquadron. The ſhip and the remaining part of the crew, with the
                    cargo, were carried to Portugal, from whence no redreſs could be obtained; and
                    James III. granted letters of marque to John and Robert Bartons, heirs to the
                    Barton who had been murdered. Upon the acceſſion of James IV. to the crown of
                    Scotland, the letters of marque were recalled, and a friendly correſpondence was
                    entered into between James and his Portugueſe majeſty. No redreſs, however, was
                    to be had from the latter; and Robert Barton being made a priſoner, and his ſhip
                    a prize, he was detained in Zealand, till James procured his deliverance, by
                    applying in his favour to the emperor Maximilian. Sir Andrew Barton took part in
                    the quarrel; and having obtained a like letter of marque, he made dreadful
                    depredations on the Portugueſe trade, and, according to Engliſh authors, he
                    plundered many Engliſh ſhips, on pretence of their carrying Portugueſe property,
                    and made the navigation of the narrow ſeas dangerous to Engliſhmem The court of
                    London received daily complaints of Barton’s depredations; but Henry being at
                    this time very averſe to quarrel with James, theſe complaints were heard with
                    great coldneſs at his council-board. The earl of Surry had then two ſons,
                    gallant noblemen; and he declared to Henry’s face, that while he had an eſtate
                    that could furniſh out a ſhip, or a ſon who was capable of commanding one, the
                    narrow ſeas ſhould not be infeſted. Henry could not diſcourage this generous
                    offer; and letters of marque were accordingly granted to the two young noblemen,
                    Sir Thomas and Sir Edward Howard. The prizes that Barton had taken had rendered
                    his ſhips immenſely rich, conſequently they were heavy laden, and unfit for
                    fighting; while we may eaſily ſuppoſe, that the ſhips of the Howards were clean,
                    and of a ſuperior force in every reſpect to thoſe of Barton. After encountering
                    a great deal of foul weather, Sir Thomas Howard came up with the Lyon, which was
                    commanded by. Sir Andrew Barton in perſon; and Sir Edward fell in with the
                    Unicorn, Barton’s other ſhip. The event was ſuch as might be expected from the
                    inequality of the match. Sir Andrew Barton was killed, while he was animating,
                    with his whiſtle, his men to hold out to the laſt; and both the Scotch ſhips
                    being taken, were carried in triumph to London, with their crews priſoners.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi> could never forgive Henry for the loſs of his
                    brave officer. He ſent to demand ſatisfaction; but all the anſwer he received
                    was, that Barton and his crews were lawleſs pirates, and that what had been done
                    againſt them ought never to have been reſented amongſt ſovereign princes. James
                    aſſerted, that Barton was no pirate, becauſe he bore his commiſſion; and that he
                    ought to have been convicted of piratical acts before he was treated as being
                    guilty of them. Henry intimated to James, that he was willing to accommodate the
                    affair by way of negociation; but James thought himſelf affronted by the
                    propoſal.</p>
                <p>Various negociations took place concerning this and other affairs till the year
                    1513; when James, though he had for ſome time before been fully reſolved upon a
                    war with England, thought it highly neceſſary that it ſhould have the ſanction
                    of his parliament, which he aſſembled for that purpoſe. The young nobility were
                    not only inſpired with the ſentiments of James, but had been won over by the
                    French; and the majority of them, as well as of the clergy (which was ſomewhat
                    extraordinary, as James was, in effect, to fight againſt the pope and his
                    allies), were keen for a war with England. The old counſellors, on the other
                    hand, who ſaw the flouriſhing ſtate of Scotland, ariſing from a long peace and
                    their commerce, which was protected by a fleet, dreaded the ruinous conſequences
                    of the war. The queen naturally headed this party; and ſhe was joined by the
                    earl oſ Angus and the wiſeſt part of the nobility. Their arguments made no
                    impreſſion upon James, who had received a preſent from Louis of four ſhips laden
                    with wine and flour, and two ſhips of war completely equipped, one of them
                    carrying 34 pieces of braſs ordnance. He promiſed to the French queen, upon his
                    honour, that he would take the field againſt the Engliſh; and ſhe had ſent him a
                    freſh letter, gently reproaching him for want of gallantry, and for not being ſo
                    good as his word. In ſhort, the reaſonings of the wiſeſt and beſt part oſ the
                    nobility were over ruled, and the expedition againſt England was reſolved
                    on.</p>
                <p>The earl of Hume, who was chamberlain of Scotland, was, at this juncture, at the
                    head of 7000 or 8000 men, with whom he committed prodigious de</p>
                <p>vaſtations on the Engliſh borders. Henry’s queen, Catharine of Spain, whom he had
                    left regent of his dominions, iſſued a commiſſion of array, directed to Sir
                    Thomas Lovel, knight of the garter, for aſſembling the militia of the counties
                    of Nottingham, Derby, Warwick, Leiceſter, Stafford, Rutland, Northampton, and
                    Lincoln. The management of the war, however, was chiefly committed to the earl
                    of Surry, who aſſembled the militia of Cheſter, Lancaſter, Northumberland,
                    Weſtmoreland, Cumberland, and the biſhopric of Durham. The earl of Hume had by
                    this time laid great part of Northumberland waſte; and his men were returning
                    home laden with booty. The earl of Surry, reſolving to intercept them, ordered
                    Sir William Bul∙ mer to form an ambuſh with 1000 archers, at a place called <hi
                        rend="italic">Broomhou</hi> ſ <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> which was extremely
                    convenient for that purpoſe, as the Scots were obliged to paſs that way. As the
                    latter expected nothing of that kind, Bulmer executed his orders with great
                    ſucceſs. The archers aſſaulted the Scots all at once, and made ſo good uſe of
                    their arrows, that their main body was put to flight, 500 were killed, and 400
                    taken, with the Lord Hume’s ſtandard, which he left on the field of battle; the
                    greateſt part of the plunder being recovered at the fame time. The commonalty of
                    Scotland termed this expedition of the Lord Hume’s the <hi rend="italic">Ill
                        road.</hi></p>
                <p>James was more exaſperated than ever by this defeat, and continued his
                    preparations for invading England with additional vigour. His queen did all that
                    became a wiſe and prudent wife to divert him. from his fatal purpoſe. She
                    endeavoured to work upon his ſuperſtition, by recounting to him her ominous
                    dreams and boding apprehenſions. James treating theſe as mere illuſions and
                    fictions of the brain, ſhe had recourſe to other arts. While James was waiting
                    at Linlithgow for the arrival of his army from the north and the Highlands, he
                    aſſiſted one afternoon at the veſpers in the church of St Michael. Being placed
                    in one of the canon’s ſeats, a venerable, comely man oſ about 52 years of age,
                    entered, drefſed in a long garment of an azure colour, and girded round with a
                    towel or roll of linen, his forehead bald, and his yellow locks hanging down his
                    ſhoulders; in ſhort, he was drefſed and<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0008.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0002"/> formed to appear like St Andrew, the apoſtle of
                    Scotland, as he is repreſented in painting and ſculpture. The church being
                    crowded, this perfſonage, with ſome difficulty, made his way to the king’s ſeat;
                    and leaning over it, he ſpoke to the following purpoſe: “Sir (ſaid he), I am
                    ſent hither to intreat you for this time to delay your expedition, and to
                    proceed no farther in your intended journey: for if you do, you ſhall not
                    proſper in your enterpriſe, nor any of your followers. I am further charged to
                    warn you, if ye be ſo refractory as to go forward, not to uſe the acquaintance,
                    company, or counſel of women, as ye tender your honour, life, and eſtate.” After
                    delivering thoſe words, he retired through the crowd, and was no more ſeen,
                    though, when the ſervice was ended, James earneſtly inquired after him.</p>
                <p>That this ſcene was acted, ſeems to be paſt diſpute; for Sir David Lindſay, who
                    was then a young man, and preſent in the church, reported it both to Buchanan
                    and Lindſay the hiſtorian. It is, however, equally certain, that the whole was a
                    contrivance of the queen, to whoſe other afflictions the ſtings of jealouſy were
                    now added. In one of the Scotch inroads into England, one Heron, the proprietor
                    of the caſtle of Ford, had been taken priſoner, and ſent to Scotland; where he
                    was detained on a charge of murder, of which he ſeems to have been innocent. The
                    Engliſh hiſtorians mention this as having paſſed after James entered England:
                    but from the latter part of the ſuppoſed phantom’s ſpeech, it is probable that
                    it happened before; and that Heron’s wife and beautiful daughter had been for
                    ſome time ſoliciting James for his deliverance. Be that as it may, it is too
                    probable that James was ſmitten with the charms of the daughter; and that her
                    mother, who was a moſt artful woman, knew how to avail herſelf of the conqueſt.
                    Pretending that ſhe had intereſt enough to procure the releaſe of the lord
                    Johnſton and Alexander Home, who were priſoners in England, ſhe was permitted by
                    James to keep a conſtant correſpondence with the earl of Surry, to whom ſhe is
                    ſaid to have betrayed all James’s ſecrets and meaſures. The rendezvous of
                    James’s army was at the Burrowmoor, to which James repaired; and having given
                    orders for the march of his artillery, he lodged at the abbey of Holyroodhouſe.
                    While he was there, another attempt was made to divert him from his purpoſe of
                    invading England: but James, deaf to all the ſolicitations and inventions of his
                    queen, muſtered his army; and on the 22d of Auguſt he paſſed the Tweed,
                    encamping that night near the banks of the Twiſſel. On his arrival at
                    Twiſſelhaugh on the 14th, he called an aſſembly of his lords together, and made
                    a declaration, that the heirs of all ſuch as ſhould die in the army, or be
                    killed by the enemy during his flay in England, ſhould have their wards, relief,
                    and marriages of the king; who, upon that account, diſpenſed with their age.
                    This is ſaid to have been the criſis of that prince’s fate. Abandoned to his
                    paſſion for his Engliſh miſtreſs, ſhe prevailed with him, at her mother’s
                    inſtigation, to trifle away his time for ſome days; during which internal, the
                    junction of the Engliſh army was formed. The earl of Surry, the Engliſh general,
                    was then at Pomfret: but ordered the landholders of the neighbouring counties to
                    certify to him in writing what number of men each could furniſh, charging them
                    to</p>
                <p>be ready at an hour’s warning; and he laid his plan ſo, as not to bring his army
                    into the field till James had advanced ſo ſar into England as to render it very
                    difficult for him to retire without a general battle. This precaution aſſiſted
                    the lady Ford (as ſhe is called) in perſuading James that there was no danger in
                    the delay, becauſe the Engliſh had not the face of an army in the field.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the earl of Surry ordered the governors of Berwick and Norham,
                    the two ſtrongeſt places on the frontiers of England, to prepare for a vigorous
                    reſiſtance in caſe they were attacked; and directed them to certify how long
                    they could hold out, in hopes, that if they made a reſolute defence, James would
                    march on; and leave them in his rear, The governor of Norham’s anſwer was, that
                    his caſtle was ſo well provided, as to leave him no doubt, in caſe of a ſiege,
                    to be able to defend it till king Henry ſhould return from abroad, and relieve
                    it in perſon. James, however, beſieged it on the 25th of Auguſt, and battered it
                    ſo furiouſly, that he took it by capitulation the ſixth day after. James then
                    proceeded to the caſtle of Etal belonging to the family of Manners (now duke of
                    Rutland); which he took and demoliihed likewiſe, as he alſo did Wark, and
                    arrived before the caſtle of Ford. The Scotch army is generally allowed to have
                    conſiſted of at leaſt 50,000 men when it paſſed the Tweed. At this time it was
                    encamped on the heights of Cheviot, in the heart of a country naturally barren,
                    and now deſolate through the precautions taken by the Engliſh general. Being
                    obliged to extend their quarters for the benefit of ſubſiſtence, the mercenary
                    part of them had acquired a conſiderable plunder, with which, as uſual, they
                    retired to their own country, as many more did for want of ſubfiſtence. The earl
                    of Surry knew their ſituation, and ordered the rendezvous of his army, firſt at
                    Newcaſtle, and then near Norham, having certain intelligence of the vaſt
                    deſertions daily happening in the Scotch army, which had reduced it greatly. The
                    wetneſs of the ſeaſon rendered his march, eſpecially that of the artillery,
                    extremely difficult; but being joined by ſeveral perſons of diſtinction, he
                    marched on the 3d of September to Alnwic, where he was reinforeed by 5000 hardy
                    veteran troops, ſent from the Engliſh army on the continent, under the command
                    of his ſon the lord admiral of England; ſo that the Engliſh authors admit his
                    army to have conſiſted of 26,000 men, all completely armed and provided for the
                    field. James having, in the manifeſto which he diſperſed on his entering
                    England, given the death of Barton as one of the cauſes of his invaſion, the
                    lord-admiral had prevailed with Henry to ſend him upon this ſervice; and he
                    informed James by a letter, that he intended to juſtify the death of that pirate
                    in the front of the Engliſh army.</p>
                <p>By this time the army of James was, by deſertion and other cauſes, reduced to
                    leſs than half its numbers; but the chief misfortune attending it was his own
                    conduct. His indolence and inactivity, joined to the ſcandalous examples of his
                    amours, at ſuch a ſeaſon, had diſguſted ſeveral of his greateſt men and beſt
                    friends; and ſome of them more than ſuſpected a correſpondence between the
                    Engliſh lady and the earl of Surry. James was deaf to all their remonſtrances;
                    and the earl of Angus declared, that he was reſolved to return home, as he
                    ſoreſaw that the ruin of the army was inevitable<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0009.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0003"/> through the
                    obſtinacy of James. He accordingly withdrew to Scotland, but left behind him his
                    two ſons. The lord Hume and the earl of Huntley were likewiſe diſcontented. The
                    former had brought his men into the field; but, according to ſome Scotch
                    hiſtorians, with a deſign rather to betray than to ſerve James: but Huntley,
                    though he diſliked his maſter’s conduct, remained firmly attached to his
                    perſon.</p>
                <p>The defection or backwardneſs of thoſe great men ſeemed to make no impreſſion
                    upon James. He had choſen a ſtrong camp in the neighbourhood of Ford, on the
                    ſide of a mountain called Floddon-hill; and he was ſeparated from the Engliſh
                    army by the river Till. This advantageous ſituation put the earl of Surry under
                    great difficulties; for it rendered the Scotch army inacceſſible, as it was
                    fortified by artillery, and was now well ſupplied with proviſions by the change
                    of its ſituation. The earl drew up a manifeſto, with which he charged Rouge
                    Croix herald, who was attended by a trumpet. It contained ſome propoſals for an
                    exchange of priſoners, which ſeems to have been calculated to give the lady Ford
                    the more credit with James; but concluded with reproaches for his perfidious
                    invaſion of England, and a defiance to James to fight him in a general battle.
                    The herald was farther charged with a verbal commiſſion to acquaint James, that
                    the earl oſ Surry had iſſued orders that no quarter ſhould be given to any of
                    the Scotch army but the king himſelf.</p>
                <p>A council of war was called on this occaſion; in which the earl of Huntley and
                    others made ſtrong remonſtrances againſt a general engagement. They ſhewed how
                    fatal it muſt be to Scotland, ſhould it prove unſucceſsful; and that the wiſeſt
                    courſe James could follow was to return home, where, if he was purſued by the
                    enemy, he could fight to great advantage. The earl of Huntley, however, added,
                    that his opinion ſhould be determined by that of the king and council; and that
                    he was equally ready to ſhare in his majeſty’s danger as his glory.</p>
                <p>Huntley and the other noblemen were oppoſed by the French ambaſſador, who
                    repreſented a retreat as diſgraceful to the nobility of Scotland and the arms of
                    James; and uſed many romantic arguments of the ſame kind, which but too well
                    ſuited with the king’s diſpoſition. According to Drummond, the council were of
                    opinion, that the king ſhould immediately beſiege Berwick; but be that as it
                    will, the majority of them were certainly oſ opinion, that it was beneath the
                    dignity of James to fight the earl of Surry at that nobleman’s requiſition, and
                    that James could loſe no honour by returning home. Patrick lord Lindſay of
                    Byres, mentioned on a former occaſion, and who was preſident of the council,
                    expreſſed himſelf ſo ſtrongly on that head, that James, in a paſſion, is ſaid by
                    the hiſtorian Lindſay to have ſworn, that if ever he lived to return to
                    Scotland, he would hang that nobleman at his own gate. He ordered Rouge Croix to
                    be called in; and after treating him with great politeneſs, he ſent a meſſage to
                    the earl of Surry by one of his own heralds (Iſlay), importing, that he would
                    give the Engliſh battle on the Friday following; and that had he received ſuch a
                    meſſage from the earl even in his own caſtle of Edinburgh, he would have left
                    that, and all other buſineſs, to have fought him. With this meſſage,</p>
                <p>a ſmall manifeſto, in vindication of James’s conduct, was ſent by the ſame
                    herald.</p>
                <p>The earl of Surry, who was then ſo infirm that he was carried about in a ſedan or
                    chariot, had foreſeen that James would return an anſwer by one of his own
                    heralds; but, unwilling that he ſhould obtain any knowledge of the ſituation of
                    the Engliſh camp, he ordered proper perſons to receive him at two miles
                    diſtance, where ſoon after he attended himſelf in perſon. Iſlay executed his
                    commiſſion without paying much reſpect to the perſon of the Engliſh general; who
                    diſmiſſed him, after beſtowing great compliments upon the honour and courage of
                    James. The earl then ordered his army to march in the line of battle towards
                    Wollerhaugh. There he was joined by Rouge Croix, herald, who gave him an account
                    of the ſtrong ſituation of the Scotttiſh camp; but the advanced poſts of the
                    Engliſh army were then within three miles of their enemies, and the earl of
                    Surry found his difficulties daily increaſing. The roads were broken up, the
                    ſwelling of the rivers cut him off from the neceſſary communications for
                    ſupplying his army, and nothing but a battle could ſave him either from being
                    diſhanded or deſtroyed.</p>
                <p>James ſeems to have ſo far regarded the advice of his wiſeſt counſellors, as not
                    to abandon his ſtrong ſituation. They endeavoured to perſuade him, that it was a
                    ſufficient guard to his honour, if he did not decline the battle on the day
                    appointed; and that his engagement did not bind him to fight upon
                    diſadvantageous ground. The Scots, at the ſame time, knew of their enemy’s
                    diſtreſſes; and, as Drummond elegantly expreſſes it, they remonſtrated to their
                    king, that he lacked nothing but patience to be victorious. The Scots thus lying
                    on the defenſive, the earl of Surry again ſent Rouge Croix to inform James that
                    he was ready to give him battle. James was ſenſibly nettled at this tacit
                    imputation upon his honour, and perhaps was inwardly vexed for having followed
                    the wiſe advice of his noblemen. It is certain, from the beſt authorities, that
                    he neglected the neceſſary precautions for guarding the paſſages of the Till,
                    which the Engliſh croſſed, partly at a place where it was fordable, and partly
                    at a bridge. We are told, not without a great appearance of probability, that
                    while the Engliſh were paſſing the bridge, Borthwick, maſter of the Scotch
                    artillery, fell upon his knees, and begged permiſſion from James to point his
                    cannon againſt the bridge; but that James anſwered him in a paſſion, that it
                    muſt be at the peril of his (Borthwick’s) head, and that he was reſolved to ſee
                    all his enemies that day on the plain before him in a body. The earl of Surry,
                    after paſſing the Till, took poſſeſsion of Braxton, which lay to the right of
                    the Scotch camp; and by that ſituation he cut off the communication of his
                    enemies with the Tweed, and commanded the Till below Etoncaſtle. The Scotch
                    generals ſaw themſelves now in danger of being reduced to the ſame ſtraits in
                    which their enemies had been involved two days before, and their country open to
                    an invaſion of the Engliſh army. James had ſecret intelligence that this was far
                    from being the intention of the Engliſh general; and imagining that the latter’s
                    intention was to take poſſeſſion of a ſtrong camp upon a hill between him and
                    the Tweed, which would give the Engliſh a farther command of the country, he
                    reſolved to be be-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0010.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0004"/> fore-hand with the earl, and gave orders for
                    making large fires of green wood, that the ſmoke might cover his march along the
                    height, to take advantage of that eminence. But while this ſtratagem concealed
                    his march from the Engliſh, their movements were concealed from him: for when he
                    came to the brow of the height over which he had marched, he found the enemy
                    drawn up in order of battle on the plain, but ſo cloſe to the height where he
                    was, that his artillery, on which his great dependence was, muſt overſhoot
                    them.</p>
                <p>A battle was now not only unavoidable, but the only means of ſaving the Scotch
                    army, which was probably far from being a diſagreeable circumſtance to James.
                    His perſon was ſo dear to his troops, that many of them dreſſed themſelves as
                    nearly as they could in the ſame coats of armour and with the ſame diſtinctions
                    that James wore that day. His generals had earneſtly deſired him to retire to a
                    place of ſafety, where his perſon would be ſecure in all events: but he
                    obſtinately refuſed to follow their advice; and on the ninth of September, early
                    in the morning, diſpoſitions were ordered for the line of battle. The command of
                    the van was allotted to the earl of Huntley; the earls of Lenox and Argyle
                    commanded the Highlanders under James, who, ſome ſay, ſerved only as a
                    volunteer; and the earls of Crawford and Montroſe led the body of referve. The
                    earl of Surry gave the command of his van to his ſon, the lord-admiral; his
                    right wing was commanded by his other ſon, Sir Edward Howard; and his left by
                    Sir Marmaduke Conſtable. The rear was commanded by the earl himſelf, lord
                    Dacres, and Sir Edward Stanley. Under thoſe leaders ſerved the flower of all the
                    nobility and gentry then in England. Other writers give different accounts of
                    the diſpoſition of the Engliſh army, but they may be reconciled by the different
                    forms into which the battle was thrown before it was decided. The lord Hume is
                    mentioned as ſerving under the earls of Crawford and Montroſe, and Hepburn earl
                    of Bothwel was in the rear.</p>
                <p>The firſt motion of the Engliſh army was by the lord-admiral, who ſuddenly
                    wheeled to the right, and ſeized a paſs at Milford, where he planted his
                    artillery ſo as to command the moſt ſloping part of the aſcent where the Scots
                    were drawn up; and it did great execution. The Scots had not foreſeen this
                    manœuvre; and it put them into ſuch diſorder, that the earl of Huntley found it
                    neceſſary to attack the lord-admiral; which he did with ſo much fury, that he
                    drove him from his poſt; and the conſequence muſt have been fatal to the
                    Engliſh, had not his precipitate retreat been covered by ſome ſquadrons of horſe
                    under the lord Dacres, which gave the lord-admiral an opportunity of rallying
                    and new-forming his men. The earl of Surry now found it neceſſary to advance to
                    the front, ſo that the Engliſh army formed one continued line, which galled the
                    Scots with perpetual diſcharges of their artillery and bows. The Highlanders, as
                    uſual, impatient to come to a cloſe ſight, and to ſhare in the honour of the
                    day, which they now thought their own, ruſhed down the declivity with their
                    broad-ſwords, but without order or diſcipline, and before the reft of the army,
                    particularly the diviifon under lord Hume, advanced to ſupport them. Their
                    impetuoſity, however, made a conſiderable impreſſion upon the main battle of the
                    Ehgliſh; and the king bringing up the earl of</p>
                <p>Bothwel’s referve, the battle became general and doubtful: but by this time the
                    lord-admiral, having again formed his men, came to the aſſiſtance of his father,
                    and charged the diviſion under the earls of Crawford and Montroſe, who were
                    marching up to ſupport the Highlanders, among whom the king and his attendants
                    were now fighting on foot: while Stanley, making a circuit round the hill,
                    attacked the Highlanders in the rear. Crawford and Montroſe, not being ſeconded,
                    according to the Scotch hiſtorians, by the Humes, were routed; and thus all that
                    part of the Scotch army which was engaged under their king, was completely
                    ſurrounded by the diviſion of the Engliſh under Surry, Stanley, and the
                    lord-admiral. In this terrible ſituation, James acted with a coolneſs not common
                    to his temper. He drew up his men in a circular form, and their valour more than
                    once opened the ranks of the Engliſh, or obliged them to ſtand aloof, and again
                    have recourſe to their bows and artillery. The chief of the Scotch nobility made
                    freſh attempts to prevail with James to make his eſcape while it was
                    practicable; but he obſtinately continued the fight; and thereby became
                    acceſſory to his own ruin, and that of his troops, whom the Engliſh would gladly
                    have ſuffered to retreat. He ſaw the earls of Montroſe, Crawford, Argyle, and
                    Lenox, fall by his fide, with the braveſt of his men lying dead on the ſpot; and
                    darkneſs now coming on, he himſelf was killed by an unknown hand. The Engliſh
                    were ignorant of the victory they had gained; and had actually retreated from
                    the field of battle, with a deſign of renewing it next morning.</p>
                <p>This diſaſter was evidently owing to the romantic diſpoſition of the king
                    himſelf, and to the want of diſcipline among many of his ſoldiers; though ſome
                    writers have aſcribed it to the treachery of lord Hume. Many of James’s
                    domeſtics knew and mourned over his body; and it appeared that he had received
                    two mortal wounds, one through the trunk with an arrow, and the other on the
                    head with a ball. His coat of armour was preſented to queen Catharine, who
                    informed her huſband, then in France, of the victory over the Scots. The loſs on
                    both ſides, in this engagement, is far from being aſcertained; though Polydore
                    Virgil, who lived at the time, mentions the loſs of the Engliſh at 5000, and
                    that of the Scots at 10,000.</p>
                <p>After the death of king James TV. the adminiſtration devolved on the
                    queen-dowager; but ſhe being big with a poſthumous child, and unable to bear the
                    weight of public buſineſs, accepted of Beaton archbiſhop of, Glaſgow and
                    chancellor of Scotland, with the earls of Huntley, Angus, and Arran, to aſſiſt
                    her in the affairs of government. Soon after her huſband’s death ſhe had wrote
                    an affecting letter to her brother the king of England, informing him of her
                    pregnancy, ſetting forth the deplorable ſtate of the kingdom, with her own
                    condition, and imploring his friendſhip and protection for herſelf and her
                    infant ſon. This letter ſeems never to have been communicated by Henry to his
                    council; but he anſwered it, and informed his ſilter, that if the Scots would
                    have peace, they ſhould have peace, and war if they choſe it. “He added
                    (according to Drummond), that her huſhand had fallen by his own indiſcreet
                    raſhneſs, and fooliſh kindneſs to France; that he regretted his death as his
                    ally, and ſhould be willing to prohibit all hoſtility againſt the country of
                        Scotland-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0011.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0005"/>
                    during the minority of her ſon. For a remedy of preſent evils, one year’s truce
                    and a day longer was yielded unto; in which time he had leiſure to proſecute his
                    deſigns againſt France, without fear of being diſturbed or diverted by the
                    incurſions and inroads of the Scots upon his borders.”</p>
                <p>Thus far Drummond: but though Henry might grant this time to his ſiſter’s
                    intreaty, yet it certainly did not become a national meaſure; for it appears by
                    a letter dated two years after, from the Scots council to the king of France,
                    publiſhed by Rymer, that the Scots never had deſired a truce. So far from that,
                    the French influence, joined to a deſire of revenge, remained ſo ſtrong in the
                    kingdom, that after the meeting of the parliament, ſome of the members were ſo
                    violent as to propoſe a renewal of the war. This motion was indeed over-ruled by
                    the more moderate part of the aſſembly: but they could not be brought to make
                    any advances towards Henry for a peace; and every day was now big with public
                    calamity, which ſeems to have gathered ſtrength while the queen was in
                    child-bed. The archbiſhopric of St Andrew’s being vacant, it was offered by
                    univerſal conſent to Elphinſton biſhop of Aberdeen; but being now old and
                    infirm, he declined it. Three competitors for that high dignity then appeared.
                    The firſt was Gawin Douglas, who was then abbot of Aberbrothwic, to which he was
                    preſented by the queen upon her recovery (having been brought to bed of a ſon)
                    the very day before her marriage with his nephew the earl of Angus: and upon the
                    death of biſhop Elphinſton in November following, ſhe preſented him likewiſe to
                    the archbiſhopric of St Andrew’s. The ſecond competitor was John Hepburn, prior
                    of St Andrew’s; a bold, avaricious, reſtleſs, but ſhrewd and ſenſible prieſt. By
                    his office he had received the rents of the ſee during its vacancy; and having
                    prevailed with the canons, on pretence of ancient privileges, to elect him
                    archbiſhop, without regard to the nomination either of the queen or pope, he
                    drove Douglas’s ſervants from the caſtle of St Andrew’s, of which they had taken
                    poſſeſſion. The third and moſt powerful competitor was Forman biſhop of Moray in
                    Scotland, and archbiſhop of Bourges in France, a dignity to which he had been
                    raiſed for his public ſervices. He had in his intereſt not only the duke of
                    Albany (ſon to the traitor duke) firſt prince of the blood, but alſo the court
                    of Rome itſelf; and having received the pope’s bull and nomination to the
                    dignity, he was conſidered by the Scotch clergy in general, and by the principal
                    tenants and dependents upon the ſee, as the legal archbiſhop.</p>
                <p>The preference given to Forman diſcouraged Douglas from purſuing his pretenſions;
                    but Hepburn, being supported by the clan of his own name and by the Humes, made
                    ſo formidable a head againſt his rivals, that none could be found daring enough
                    to publiſh the papal bull in favour of Forman. The friends of the latter,
                    however, having intimated to the earl of Hume, that his credit at the court of
                    Rome could eaſily procure the rich abbey of Coldingham for his younger brother,
                    the earl put himſelf at the head of his followers, and, notwithſtanding all the
                    oppoſition given by the Hepburns, he proclaimed the pope’s bull over the croſs
                    of Edinburgh. This daring action plainly proved that the earl of Hume had more
                    power than</p>
                <p>the queen-regent herſelf; but Hepburn s reſolution, and the greatneſs of his
                    friends, obliged Forman to agree to a compromiſe. Hepburn was advanced to the
                    ſee of Moray, without accounting for the revenues of the archbiſhopric, which he
                    had received during its vacancy; and he gave Forman a preſent of three thouſand
                    crowns, to be divided among his friends and followers.</p>
                <p>In April 1514, the poſthumous ſon, of whom the queen had been delivered in
                    Stirling caſtle, was by the biſhop of Caithneſs baptized Alexander. On the 6th
                    of Auguſt this year ſhe was married to the earl of Angus; than which nothing
                    could be accounted more impolitic. She had neither conſulted her brother nor the
                    ſtates of Scotland in the match; and by her having accepted of a huſband, ſhe in
                    fact reſigned all claim to the regency under the late king’s will. The
                    Douglaffes did not diſpute her having diveſted herſelf of the regency: but they
                    affirmed, that the ſtates might lawfully reinſtate her in it; and that the peace
                    of the kingdom required it, as it was the only meaſure that could preſerve the
                    happy tranquillity which then ſubſiſted between Scotland and England. The earl
                    of Hume put himſelf at the head of the oppoſition to this proposal. He knew that
                    he had enemies, and he dreaded that the farther aggrandizement of Angus muſt
                    weaken his intereſt on the borders. He was joined by a number of the young
                    nobility, who, though otherwiſe divided, united againſt Angus. In ſhort, the
                    general opinion was, that the Douglaſſes were already too great; and that ſhould
                    the queen be reinſtated in the regency, they muſt be abſolute within the
                    kingdom, and engroſs all places oſ power and profit. It was added by the earl of
                    Hume, that he had, out of reſpectto 'the late king’s memory, ſubmitted to the
                    queen’s government; and that, now ſhe had made a voluntary abdication of it by
                    her marriage, it ought not to be renewed.</p>
                <p>After ſome deliberations, the duke of Albany was choſen regent. He was a man
                    poſſeſſed of all the qualities requiſite for a good governor; nor did he deceive
                    the expectations of the public. On his arrival at Glaſgow, he took upon him the
                    titles of earl of March, Marr, Garioch, lord of Annandale, and of the iſle of
                    Man, regent and protector of the kingdom of Scotland. On his arrival at
                    Edinburgh he was received in form by the three eſtates of the kingdom, and the
                    queen had met him at ſome diſtance from the town. The parliament then reſumed
                    its ſeſſion, and the three eſtates took an oath of obedience, till the king,
                    then an infant of four years old, ſhould arrive at the years of maturity.</p>
                <p>The firſt thing at which the regent aimed, was the conciliating the differences
                    amongſt the various contending families in the kingdom; at the ſame time that he
                    ſuppreſſed ſome daring robbers, one oſ whom is ſaid to have had no fewer than
                    800 attendants in his infamous proſeſſion. So great was his love of good order
                    and decency, that he puniſhed the lord Drummond with the loſs of his eſtate for
                    having ſtruck Lyon king at arms, whoſe perſon, as the firſt herald in Scotland,
                    ought to have been held ſacred. Nay, it was at the eameſt felicitation of Lyon
                    himſelf. and many of the chief nobility, that a greater puniſhment was not
                    inflicted. However, the forfeiture was afterwards<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0012.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0006"/> remitted; but
                    not before Drummond had, upon his knees, acknowledged his offence, and ſubmitted
                    himſelf before Lyon.</p>
                <p>The regent had not been long in office before he took into favour Hepburn the
                    prior of St Andrew’s, wham he conſulted for information concerning the ſtate of
                    Scotland. Hepburn acquainted him with all the feuds and animoſities which raged
                    among the great families of Scotland, their ferocious character, and barbarous
                    behaviour to their enemies. He repreſented the civil power as too weak to curb
                    theſe potent chieftains; and gave it as his opinion that the regent’s
                    adminiſtration ought to be ſupported by foreign arms, meaning thoſe of
                    France.</p>
                <p>Hepburn is ſaid alſo to have gained an aſcendency over the regent by means of
                    large ſums of money laid out among his domeſtics, by a fawning and plauſible
                    addreſs, and by well-directed flatteries; and he employed this aſcendency to
                    deſtroy thoſe who were obnoxious to himſelf. The earl of Hume, as being the
                    firſt ſubject in rank and authority, became obnoxious to the regent through the
                    inſinuations of Hepburn; and as that nobleman had frequent occaſion to be at
                    court in virtue of his office of chamberlain, he ſoon perceived that neither he
                    nor his friends were welcome gueſts there. Alarmed for his own ſafety, he
                    reſolved to form a party alongſt with the queen-mother and her new huſband
                    againſt the regent. This was by no means a difficult taſk: for the queen
                    naturally imagined that her new huſband ought to have had ſome ſhare in the
                    government; and the earl of Angus readily concurred in the ſcheme. In the mean
                    time, the regent was making a progreſs. through Scotland, while bloody feuds
                    were raging among the nobles: but before any remedy could be applied to theſe
                    diſorders, he was informed of the ſchemes laid by the queen-mother and her
                    party; and that ſhe had reſolved to fly into England with her two infants. On
                    this he inſtantly returned to Edinburgh; and, as no time was to be loſt, ſet out
                    at midnight that very night, and ſurpriſed the caſtle of Stirling, where he
                    found the queen-mother and her two infants.</p>
                <p>The regent, after this bold ſtep, took care to ſhow that the care of the royal
                    infants was his chief ſtudy. As he himſelf was nearly allied to the crown, in
                    order to remove all ſuſpicions and calumnies on that account, he committed the
                    care of the king and his brother to three noblemen of the moſt unexceptionable
                    characters in the kingdom, but of whom we now know the name only of one, viz.
                    the earl of Lenox. They were appointed to attend the princes by turns; to whom
                    alſo a guard, conſiſting partly of French and partly of Scots, was aſſigned; and
                    the queen-mother was left at liberty to reſde where ſhe pleaſed.</p>
                <p>The earl of Hume, finding his ſchemes thus abortive, retired to his own eſtate;
                    from whence he was ſoon after drawn, and obliged to fly into England, by the
                    earls of Arran and Lenox. The queen-mother retired to a monaſtery at Coldſtream;
                    and meſſengers were diſpatched to the court of England, to know how Henry would
                    have his ſiſter diſpoſed of. He ordered the lord Dacres, his warden of the
                    marches, to attend her to Harbottle-caſtle in Northumberland; and here ſhe was
                    delivered of her daughter the Lady Mary Douglas, mother to Henry lord Darnley,
                    father to James I. of England. The regent diſpatched ambaſſadors to Henry, in
                    order to vindicate his own conduct. He likewiſe ſent to aſſure the queen that
                    ſhe had nothing to fear in Scotland; and to invite her to return thither, where
                    ſhe ſhould at all times be admitted to ſee her children. This offer, however,
                    ſhe declined; and ſet out for London, where ſhe was affectionately received and
                    entertained by her brother. But in the mean time many diſorders were committed
                    throughout the kingdom by the party of the queen-mother; though, by the
                    interpoſition of archbiſhop Forman, they were at preſent terminated without
                    bloodſhed, and ſome of the principal offenders were perſuaded to return to their
                    duty. Among theſe was the earl of Angus himſelf, the queen’s huſband; which when
                    king Henry heard, he exclaimed, "That the earl, by deſerting his wife, had acted
                        <hi rend="italic">like a Scot."</hi> Lord Hume refuſed to ſurrender himſelf,
                    or to accept of the regent’s terms; and was of conſequence declared a traitor,
                    and his eſtate confiſcated. All this time he had been infeſting the borders at
                    the head of a lawleſs banditti; and now he began to commit ſuch devaſtations,
                    that the regent found it neceffary to march againſt him at the head of 1000
                    diſciplined troops. Hume being obliged to lay down his arms, was ſent priſoner
                    to Edinburgh caſtle; where the regent very unaccountably committed him to the
                    charge of his brother-in-law the earl of Arran. Hume eaſily found means to gain
                    over this near relation to his own party; and both of them, in the month of
                    October 1515, eſcaped to the borders, where they ſoon renewed hoſtilities. Both
                    the earls were now proclaimed traitors, but Hume was allowed fifteen days to
                    ſurrender himſelf. This ſhort interval the regent employed in quaſhing the
                    rebellion, for which purpoſe the parliament had allowed him 15,000 men. He
                    beſieged the caſtle of Hamilton, the earl of Arran’s chief ſeat, which was in no
                    condition of defence: but he was prevailed upon by Arran’s mother, daughter to
                    James II. and aunt to the regent himſelf, to forbear further hoſtilities, and
                    even to pardon her ſon, provided he ſhould return to his duty. Arran accordingly
                    ſubmitted; but the public tranquillity was not by that means reſtored. An
                    aſſociation, at the head of which was the earl of Moray, the king’s natural
                    brother, had been formed againſt the earl of Huntley. That nobleman was too well
                    attended to fear any danger by day; but his enemies found means to introduce
                    ſome armed troops in the nighttime into Edinburgh. On this a fierce ſkirmiſh
                    enſued, in which ſome were killed on both ſides; but farther bloodſhed was
                    prevented by the regent, who confined all the lords in priſon till he had
                    brought about a general reconciliation. One Hay, who had been very active in
                    ſtirring up the quarrels, was baniſhed to France; and only the earl of Hume now
                    continued in arms.</p>
                <p>In 1516 died the young duke of Rotheſay: an event which brought the regent one
                    degree nearer the crown, ſo that he was declared heir in cafe of the demiſe of
                    young James. Negociations were then entered into about prolonging the truce
                    which at that time ſubſiſted with England; but Henry inſiſting upon a removal of
                    the regent from his place, they were for the preſent dropped. Finding, however,
                    that he could neither prevail on the parliament as a body to diſmiſs the regent,
                    nor form a party of any cooſequence againſt him,<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0013.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0007"/> he at laſt
                    conſented to a prolongation of the truce for a year.</p>
                <p>In 1517, the affairs of the regent requiring his preſence in France, he reſolved,
                    before his departure, to remove the earl of Hume, who, as we have ſeen, alone
                    continued to diſturb the public tranquillity. Under pretence of ſettling ſome
                    differences which ſtill remained with England, he called a convention of the
                    nobility; and ſent ſpecial letters to the earl of Hume and his brother to
                    attend, on account of their great knowledge in Engliſh affairs. Both of them
                    imprudently obeyed the ſummons, and were ſeized and executed as ſoon as they
                    arrived at Edinburgh. But whatever occaſion there might be for this ſeverity, it
                    loſt the affections of the people to ſuch a degree, that the regent could ſcarce
                    get the place filled up which Lord Hume had poſſeſſed. That of lord warden of
                    the marches he at laſt gave to his French favourite La Beaute, called by
                    hiſtorians Sir Anthony D’Arcy. The poſt of lord chamberlain was given to Lord
                    Fleming. Soon after this, the regent levied an army, on pretence of repreſsing
                    ſome diſturbances on the borders. Theſe being ſpeedily quelled, he ſeized on his
                    return upon the earl of Lenox, and forced him to deliver up his caſtle of
                    Dumbarton; not chooſing to leave it, during his intended abſence in France, in
                    the cuſtody of a nobleman of ſuſpected fidelity; and from ſimilar motives, he
                    afterwards took him along with him on his departure for the continent. He then
                    procured himſelf to be nominated ambaſſador to France, in which character he
                    left the kingdom; having committed the government to the archbiſhops of St
                    Andrew’s and Glaſgow, the earls of Arran, Angus, Huntley, and Argyle, with the
                    warden D’Arcy, on whom was his chief dependence.</p>
                <p>On the departure of the regent, the queen-mother left the Engliſh court; and
                    arrived with a noble retinue at Berwick, on purpoſe to viſit her ſon. Here ſhe
                    was received by her huſband; for whom ſhe had contracted an invincible aversion,
                    either on account of his infidelities to her bed, or becauſe he had deſerted her
                    in the manner already related. However, ſhe ſuppreſſed her reſentment for the
                    preſent, and accompanied him to Edinburgh. Here, in conſequence of the pro-
                    poſals made by the regent, ſhe demanded acceſs to her ſon; but was refuſed by
                    D’Arcy. Lord Erſkine, however, who was one of thoſe to whom the care of the
                    young king was committed, conveyed him to the caſtle of Craigmillar (where
                    D’Arcy had no juriſdiction), on pretence that the plague was in Edinburgh; and
                    there the queen was admitted; but this gave ſuch offence to D’Arcy, that Lord
                    Erſkine was obliged to carry back the king to the caſtle of Edinburgh, where all
                    further acceſs was denied to his mother. In ſhort, the behaviour of this
                    favourite was on all occaſions ſo haughty and violent, that he rendered himſelf
                    univerſally odious; and was at laſt murdered, with all his attendants, in his
                    way to Dunſe, where he propoſed to hold a court of juſtice.—His death was very
                    little regretted; yet his murderers were proſecuted with the utmoſt ſeverity,
                    and ſeveral perſons of diſtinction declared rebels on that account.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the regent was treated with high marks of diſtinction in France. The
                    king ſhowed him the greateſt reſpect, promiſed to aſſiſt in eſtabliſhing his</p>
                <p>authority in Scotland, and ſolemnly confirmed the ancient league between the two
                    kingdoms. Soon after, the earl of Lenox arrived from France, with aſſurances of
                    protection and aſſiſtance from the king, who was highly pleaſed at the zeal of
                    the governors in puniſhing D’Arcy’s murderers; and 500 ſoldiers arrived with
                    him, to reinforce the garriſons, eſpecially that of Dunbar.</p>
                <p>All this time the queen-mother continued at Edinburgh, employing herſelf in
                    attempts to procure a divorce from her huſband, under pretence of his having
                    been previouſly contracted to another. The affairs of the kingdom again began to
                    fall into confuſion, and many murders and commotions happened in different parts
                    of the country. The earl of Arrah had the chief direction in the ſtate; but the
                    earl of Angus, notwithſtanding the difference with his wife, had ſtill great
                    intereſt, and waited every opportunity to oppoſe him. This emulation produced an
                    encounter at Edinburgh; in which victory declared for Angus, and 72 of the
                    routed party were killed. This ſkirmiſh was fought on the 30th of April 1519,
                    and has been known in Scot3 hiſtory by the name of <hi rend="italic">Cleanſe the
                        Cauſeway.</hi></p>
                <p>On the 19th of November 1521, the regent returned from France. He found the
                    kingdom in great diſorder. The earl of Ahgus domineered in the field, but his
                    antagoniſts outvoted his party in the parliament. The queen-mother, who had
                    fixed her affections on a third huſhand, hated all parties almoſt equally; but
                    joined the duke of Albany, in hopes of his depriving the other two of their
                    power. This happened according to her expectation; and ſhe was with the regent
                    when he made a kind of triumphal entry into Edinburgh, attended by a number of
                    perſens of the firſt rank.—The carl of Angus was now ſummoned to appear as a
                    criminal; but his wife interceded for him, not out of any remains of affection,
                    but becauſe he gave her no oppoſition in the proceſs of divorce which was
                    depending between them.—In the mean time, Henry VIII. of England, perceiving
                    that the Scots were entirely devoted to the French intereſt, ſent a letter full
                    of accuſations againſt the regent, and threats againſt the whole nation, if they
                    did not renounce that alliance. No regard being paid to theſe requiſitions, lord
                    Dacres was ordered to proclaim upon the borders, that the Scots muſt ſtand to
                    their peril if they did not fall in with his meaſures by the firſt of March
                    1522. This producing no effect, Henry ſeized the effects of all the Scots
                    reſiding in England, and baniſhed them his dominions, after marking them,
                    according to biſhop Leſley, with a croſs, to diſtinguiſh them from his other
                    ſubjects. A war was the unavoidable conſequence of theſe proceedings; and, on
                    the 30th of April, the earl of Shrewsbury, Henry’s ſteward of the houſehold, and
                    knight of the garter, was appointed commander in chief of the army that was to
                    act againſt the Scots; and, in the mean time, Lord Dacres made an inroad as far
                    as Kelſo, plundering and burning wherever he came.</p>
                <p>The regent ordered his army to rendezvous at Roſlin; but the Scots, remembering
                    the diſaſter at Eloddon, ſhowed an extreme averſion to the war, and even told
                    the regent to his face, that though they would defend themſelves in caſe they
                    were attacked, they would not engage in a French quarrel. The regent remon-<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0014.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0008"/> ſtrated, but
                    without effect; and as the malcontents continued obſtinate, he was in danger of
                    being left by himſelf, when the queen-mother interpoſed, and prevailed upon Lord
                    Dacres to agree to a conference, the event of which was a renewal of the
                    negociations for peace.</p>
                <p>The regent perceiving, by the diſgrace of this expedition, that he had loſt his
                    former popularity, determined to revenge himſelf; and therefore told thoſe whom
                    he could truſt, that he was about to return to France, from whence he ſhould
                    bring ſuch a force by ſea and land, as ſhould render it unneceſſary for him to
                    aſk leave of the Scots any more to invade England. Accordingly he embarked for
                    France on the 25th of October, but publicly gave out that he would return the
                    enſuing Auguſt.</p>
                <p>On the regent’s arrival in France, he made a demand of 10,000 foot and 5000 horſe
                    for carrying on the war againſt England; but the ſituation of King Francis did
                    not then allow him to ſpare ſo many at once, though he was daily ſending over
                    ſhips with men, ammunition, and money, for the French garriſons in Scotland. At
                    laſt it was publicly known in England that the regent was about to return with a
                    ſtrong fleet, and 4000 of the beſt troops in France; upon which Henry
                    determined, if poſſible, to intercept him. Sir William Fitz-Williams, with 36
                    large ſhips, was ordered to block up the French ſquadron in the harbour of
                    Finhead; Sir Anthony Poyntz cruized with another in the weſtern ſeas, as Sir
                    Chriſtopher Dow and Sir Henry Shireburn did in the northern with a third
                    ſquadron. The duke of Albany, being unable to cope with Fitz-Williams, was
                    obliged to ſet out from another port with I 2 ſhips, having ſome troops on
                    board. They fell in with Fitz-Williams’s ſquadron; two of their ſhips were ſunk,
                    and the reſt driven back to Dieppe. Fitz-Williams then made a deſeent at
                    Treport, where he burnt 18 French ſhips, and returned to his ſtation off
                    Finhead. By this time the French had given the duke ſuch a reinforcement as made
                    him an overmatch for the Engliſh admiral, had the men been equally good; but the
                    regent had no dependence upon French ſailors when put in competition with the
                    Engliſh. Inſtead of coming to an engagement, therefore, as ſoon as Fitz-Williams
                    appeared, he diſembarked his ſoldiers, as if he had intended to delay his
                    expedition for that year; but a ſtorm ſoon ariſing, which obliged the Engliſh
                    fleet to return to the Downs, the regent took that opportunity of reimbarking
                    his men, and failing by the weſtern coaſts, arrived ſafe in Scotland.</p>
                <p>All this time the earl of Surry had been carrying on the moſt cruel and
                    deſtructive war againſt Scotland; inſomuch that, according to Cardinal Wolſey,
                    “there was left neither houſe, ſortreſs, village, tree, cattle, corn, nor other
                    ſnccour for man,” in the countries of Tweed- dale and March. The regent’s return
                    did not immediately put a ſtop to theſe devaſtations; for the inteſtine
                    diviſions in Scotland prevented him from taking the field. His party was
                    weakened by his long abſence, and the queen-mother had been very active
                    ſtrengthening the Engliſh intereſt. A parliament was called in 1521, where it
                    was debated, Whether peace or war with England ſhould be reſolved on? and the
                    determinations of this parliament were evidently on the worſt fide of the
                    queſtion. Henry was at this time ſo</p>
                <p>well dispoſed to cultivate a friendſhip with Scotland, that he offered to James
                    his eldeſt filter Mary in marriage; but the Scots, animated by the appearance of
                    their French auxiliaries, and corrupted by their gold, rejected all terms, and
                    reſolved upon war. However, when the army was aſſembled, and had advanced to the
                    borders, he found the ſame difficulty he had formerly experienced; for they
                    flatly refuſed to enter England With great difficulty he prevailed upon part of
                    the army to paſs the Tweed; but not meeting with ſucceſs, he was obliged to
                    return to Scotland, which at this time was divided into four factions. One of
                    theſe was headed by the regent, another by the queen, a third by the earl of
                    Arran, and a fourth by the earl of Angus, who had lived as an exile under
                    Henry’s protection. Had it been poſſible for the earl of Angus and his wife to
                    have been reconciled to each other, it would have been much for the intereſt of
                    the kingdom; but all the art even of Cardinal Wolſey could not effect this. At
                    laſt, the duke of Albany, finding all parties united againſt him, reſigned his
                    office of regent of Scotland. On the 14th of March that year, he went on board
                    one of his own ſhips for France, from whence he never returned to Scotland. He
                    did not indeed make a formal abdication of his government; ſo far from that, he
                    requeſted the nobility, whom he convened for that purpoſe, to enter into no
                    alliance with England during his abſence, which he ſaid would continue no longer
                    than the firſt of September following; to make no alteration in the government;
                    and to keep the king at Stirling.</p>
                <p>The nobility, who were impatient for the abſence of the regent, readily promiſed
                    whatever he required, but without any intention of performing it: nor, indeed,
                    was it in their power to comply; for it had been previouſly determined that
                    James himſelf ſhould now take the adminiſtration into his own hands. According
                    to Buchanan, the regent had no ſooner returned to France than Scotland relapſed
                    into all the miſeries of anarchy. The queen-dowager had the management of public
                    affairs, but her power was limited. The earl of Arran, apprehending danger from
                    the Engliſh, entered into the views of the French party. The queen-mother’s
                    diſlike to her huſband continued as great as ever, which prevented an union
                    among thoſe who were in the Engliſh intereſt; and Wolſey took that opportunity
                    of reſtoring the earl of Angus to all his importance in Scotland.— The
                    queen-mother, therefore, had no other way left to keep herſelf in power, but to
                    bring James himſelf into action. On the 29th of July, therefore, he removed from
                    Stirling to the abbey of Holyroodhouſe; where he took upon himſelf the exerciſe
                    of government, by convoking the nobility, and obliging them to ſwear allegiance
                    to his perſon a ſecond time. The truce with England was now prolonged, and the
                    queen’s party carried all before them. On the very day in which the laſt truce
                    was ſigned with England, the carl of Angus entered Scotland. He had been invited
                    from his exile in France into England, where he was careſſed by Henry, who
                    diſregarded all his ſiſter’s intreaties to lend him back to France, and now
                    reſolved to ſupport him in Scotland. Yet, though his declared intention in
                    ſending the earl to Scotland was, that the latter might balance the French party
                    there, the king enjoined him to ſue, in the moſt humble manner, for a
                        reconciliation<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0015.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0009"/> with his wife, and to co-operate with the earl
                    of Arran, who now acted as prime miniſter, as long as he ſhould oppoſe the
                    French party. On his return, however, he found himſelf excluded from all ſhare
                    in the government, but ſoon found means to form a ſtrong party in oppoſition to
                    Arrau. In the mean time, ambaſſadors were ſent to the court of England, in order
                    to treat of a perpetual peace between the two nations. At the ſame time a match
                    was propoſed between the young king of Scotland and Henry’s daughter. This had
                    originally been a ſcheme of Henry himſelf; but the emperor Charles V. had
                    reſolved to outbid him, by offering James a princeſs of his own family, with an
                    immenſe treaſure. The ambaſſadors arrived at London on the 19th of December, and
                    found Henry very much diſpoſed both to the peace and to the match. Commiſſioners
                    were appointed to treat of both; but they were inſtructed to demand by way of
                    preliminary, that the Scots ſhould abſolutely renounce their league with France,
                    and that James ſhould be ſent for education to England till he ſhould be of a
                    proper age for marriage. The Scottiſh commiſſioners declared, that they had no
                    inſtructions on theſe points: but one of them, the earl of Caſſils, offered to
                    return to Scotland, and bring a definitive anſwer from the three ſtates; and in
                    the mean time the truce was prolonged to the 15th of May 1525. On his arrival at
                    Edinburgh, he found the earl of Angus the leading man in parliament; by whoſe
                    influence it was determined that the Scots ſhould renounce their league with
                    France, and ſubſtitute in place of it a ſimilar league with England; and that
                    the king ſhould be brought up at the Engliſh court till he was of an age proper
                    for marriage: but at the ſame time they required of Henry to break off all
                    engagements with Charles V. who was the bitter enemy of Francis, and at that
                    time detained him priſoner. To this the Engliſh monarch returned but a cold
                    anſwer, being then engaged in a number of treaties with the emperor, among which
                    one was concerning the marriage of the princeſs Mary with his imperial majeſty
                    himſelf; however, before Caſſils returned, a truce of two years and a half was
                    concluded between England and Scotland.</p>
                <p>But now the queen-mother, though ſhe had always been a warm advocate for an
                    alliance between the two nations, yet diſliked the means of bringing it about.—
                    She ſaw her huſband’s party increaſing every day in power; ſo that now ſhe had
                    no other reſource than in keeping poſſeſſion of the king’s perſon, whom ſhe
                    removed to the caſtle of Edinburgh. Being now under the neceſſity of convening a
                    parliament, it was reſolved to hold it within the caſtle; which, being an un-
                    conſtitutional meaſure, gave a great handle to the earl of Arran and his party
                    to complain of the innovation. They began with remonſtrances; but finding them
                    ineffectual, they Formed a blockade of the caſtle with 2000 men, and cut off all
                    communication with the town by means of trenches. As no proviſions could thus be
                    got into the caſtle, the queen ordered ſome of the cannon to be turned againſt
                    the town, in order to force the citizens to put an end to the blockade. Several
                    ſhot were fired: but when all things appeared ready for a civil war, matters
                    were compromiſed, though in ſuch an imperfect manner as left very little room to
                    hope for perfect tranquillity. It was agreed, that the king ſhould remove out of
                    the caſtle of Edinburgh to the palace of Holy-roodhouſe; from whence he ſhould
                    repair with all poſſible magnificence to his parliament, in the houſe where it
                    was commonly held; and there a finiſhing hand was to be put to all differences.
                    This agreement was ſigned on the 25th of February 1526. The parliament
                    accordingly met, and the king’s marriage with the princeſs of England was
                    confirmed; but no mention was made of the king’s being ſent for his education
                    into that country; on the contrary, he was committed to the care of eight lords
                    of parliament. Theſe were to have the cuſtody of the king’s perſon, every one
                    his month ſucceſſively, and the whole to ſtand for the government of the ſtate;
                    yet with this limitation, “that the king, by their counſel, ſhould not ordain or
                    determine any thing in great affairs to which the queen, as princeſs and
                    dowager, did not give her conſent.” This partition of power, by giving the queen
                    a negative in all public matters, ſoon threw every thing into confuſion. The
                    earl of Angus, by leading the king into various ſcenes of pleaſure and
                    diſſipation, ſo gained the aſcendency over him, that he became in a manner
                    totally guided by him. The queen-mother, perceiving that ſhe could not have
                    acceſs to her ſon, without at the ſame time being in company with her huſband,
                    whom ſhe hated, retired ſuddenly with her domeſtics to Stirling. Thus the king
                    was left under the ſole tuition of the earl of Angus, who made a very bad uſe of
                    his power, engroſſing into his own hands, or thoſe of his friends, all the
                    places of honour or profit. The archbiſhop of St Andrew’s, having now joined the
                    king’s party, adviſed her to make a formal demand upon her huſhand, that the
                    order of government which had been ſettled laſt parliament ſhould take place,
                    and that under a penalty he ſhould ſet the king at liberty. To this the earl
                    anſwered by a kind of manifeſto drawn up by his brother; in which he declared,
                    that “the earl of Angus having been ſo highly favoured by his good uncle the
                    king of England, and that James himſelf being under great obligations to him,
                    neither the queen nor the other lords need be in any pain about him, as he choſe
                    to ſpend his time with the earl of Angus rather than with any lord in the
                    kingdom.” James himſelf, however, had diſcernment ſuſſicient to perceive, that,
                    notwithſtanding all the fair pretences of the earl of Angus, he was in fact no
                    better than his priſoner; and reſolved to attempt the recovery of his liberty.
                    The earls of Argyle and Arran had for ſome time retired from court, where they
                    had no ſhare in the adminiſtration, and were living on their own eſtates; but
                    the earl of Lenox diſſembled his∙ ſentiments ſo well, that he was neither
                    ſuſpected by the earl of Angus, nor any of the Douglas family, who were his
                    partiſans. The king being gained upon by his inſinuating behaviour, opened his
                    mind to him, and requeſted his aſſiſtance againſt his treacherous keepers. At
                    the ſame time he ſent letters to his mother, and the heads of her party, by ſome
                    of his domeſtics whom Lenox had pointed out, intreating them to remove him from
                    the carl, and not ſuffer him any longer to remain under his imperious
                    juriſdiction; adding, that if this could not be done by any other means, they
                    ſhould uſe force of arms.</p>
                <p>On receiving this letter, the queen and her party aſſembled their forces at
                    Stirling, and without loſs of time began their march for Edinburgh. Angus, on
                    the other hand, prepared to give them a warm recep-<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0016.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0010"/> tion, but at
                    the ſame time to carry along with him the king. This reſolution being made known
                    to the queen- mother, ſhe was ſo much concerned for the ſafety of her ſon, that
                    the whole party diſbanded themſelves; and thus the authority of the earl of
                    Angus ſeemed to be more eſtabliſhed than ever. Nothing, indeed, was now wanting
                    to render him deſpotic but the poſſeſſion of the great ſeal, which the
                    archbiſhop of St Andrew’s had carried with him to Dunfermline. As no deed of any
                    conſequence could be executed without this, he prevailed upon the king to demand
                    it by a ſpecial message; in conſequence of which, the archbiſhop was obliged to
                    give it up. About this time the divorce which had been ſo long in agitation
                    between the queen-mother and the earl of Angus actually took place; which, no
                    doubt, increaſed the diſlike of James to his confinement, while the imprudence
                    of Angus gave every day freſh matter of diſguſt. As Angus knew that he had no
                    firm ſupport but in the attachment of his followers to his perſon, he ſuffered
                    them to rob and plunder the eſtates of his opponents without mercy. Theſe,
                    again, did not fail to make repriſals; ſo that, towards the end of the year
                    1526, there was ſcarcely any appearance of civil government in Scotland. Thus
                    the court became almoſt totally deſerted; every nobleman being obliged to go
                    home to defend his own eſtate. Even Angus himſelſ ſhared in the common calamity,
                    and hence was frequently obliged to leave the king to the cuſtody of Lenox. To
                    this nobleman the king now made the molt grievous complaints, and charged him to
                    contrive ſome plan for his eſcape. Lenox accordingly recommended to him the
                    baron of Buccleugh, who was very powerful in the ſouthern parts, and a violent
                    enemy to Angus and the whole family of Douglas. To him he gave orders to foment
                    the diſorders in the ſouthern parts to ſuch a degree as to require the king’s
                    perſonal preſence to compoſe them. Bucclcugh was then to attack the party, and
                    take the king by force from the Douglaſſes. This ſcheme was put in execution,
                    but Buccleugh had the misfortune to be defeated; ſo that the attempt proved
                    abortive, and James found himſelf in a worſe ſituation than ever. After this
                    attempt, however, as the earl of Angus could not but know that Lenox had been
                    acceſſory to it, the former behaved towards him with ſuch viſible indifference,
                    that Lenox openly declared againſt him, and adviſed the king to form a
                    friendſhip with the archbiſhop of St Andrew’s, in order to effect his liberty.
                    This was accordingly done; but the intereſt of the archbiſhop and Lenox was
                    overbalanced by that of Arran and the Hamilton family, whom the earl of Angus
                    now drew over to his party. However, the earl of Lenox, having received powers
                    from the king for that purpoſe, ſuddenly retired from court; and publiſhed a
                    manifeſto, inviting all loyal ſubjects to aſſiſt him in delivering the king from
                    confinement. In conſequence of this he was ſoon joined by a numerous army, with
                    whom he advanced towards Edinburgh. Angus did not fail to aſſemble his
                    adherents; and ſent orders to the inhabitants of Edinburgh to take the field,
                    with the king at their head. The citizens immediately put themſelves under arms;
                    but James, pretending to be indiſpofed, Sir George Douglas, brother to the earl
                    of Angus, made him the following ſpeech: “Sir, rather than our enemies ſhould
                    take you from us, we will lay hold of your perfon</p>
                <p>and ſhould you be torn in pieces in the ſtruggle, we will carry off part of your
                    oody.” Upon this ſpeech, which James never forgot, he mounted his horſe and ſet
                    forward to Linlithgow, but with a very ſlow pace; inſomuch that Sir George
                    Douglas, afraid of not coming in time to ſuccour his brother, made uſe of many
                    indecent expreſſions and actions to puſh James on to the field of battle. Three
                    expreſſes arrived from the earl of Angus; the firſt informing his brother that
                    he was about to engage with a ſuperior army; the ſecond, that Angus was engaged
                    with a diviſion of Lenox’s army, commanded by the earl of Glencatrn; and that
                    Lenox himſelf was engaged with the Hamiltons. The third informed him that Lenox,
                    if not actually debated, was on the point of being ſo. Upon receiving this laſt
                    news, James haſtened to the field of battle, that he might ſave Lenox, and put
                    an end to the bloodſhed.— But he came too late: for the royal party was already
                    defeated with great ſlaughter; and Lenox himſelf, after being wounded and taken
                    priſoner, was murdered by Sir James Hamilton.</p>
                <p>On the night of the battle, the king was removed to Linlithgow; and though he was
                    under the greateſt grief for the fate of Lenox, the behaviour of the Dou-
                    glaffes ſtruck him with ſuch terror that he diſſembled his ſentiments. The earl
                    of Angus led his victorious troops into Fife, in hopes of ſurpriſing the queen
                    and the archbiſhop of St Andrew’s. The queen, on the news of his approach, fled,
                    with her new huſband Henry Stuart, brother to lord Evandale, to Edinburgh, and
                    both were admitted into the caſtle. The archbiſhop fled to the mountains, where
                    he was obliged to keep cattle as a ſhepherd. Angus, after having plundered the
                    caſe tle of St Andrew’s and the abbey of Dunfermline, returned in triumph to
                    Edinburgh, where he prepared to beſiege the caſtle; but the queen, hearing that
                    her ſon was among the number of the beſiegers, ordered the gates of the caſtle
                    to be thrown open, and ſurrendered herſelf and her huſband priſoners to James,
                    who was adviſed to confine them to the caſtle. After theſe repeated ſucceſſes,
                    the earl of Angus eſtabliſhed a kind of court of juſtice, in which he proſecuted
                    thoſe who had oppoſed him, among whom was the earl of Caſſils. He was offered by
                    Sir James Hamilton, natural ſon to the earl of Arran, the ſame who had murdered
                    Lenox, an indemnity if he would own himſelf a vaſſal of that houſe; but this
                    condition was rejected. Being called to his trial, and accuſed of having taken
                    arms againſt the king, a gentleman of his name and family, who was his advocate,
                    denied the charge, and offered to produce a letter under James’s own hand,
                    deſiring him to aſſiſt in delivering him from his gaolers. This ſtriking
                    evidence confounded the profecutor fo much, that the earl was acquitted; but on
                    his return home he was way-laid and murdered by one Hugh Campbell, at the
                    inſtigation of Sir James Hamilton.</p>
                <p>During theſe transactions in the ſouth, many of the Highland clans were
                    perpetrating the moſt horrid ſcenes of rapine and murder, which in ſome places
                    reigned alſo in the Lowlands. The ſtate of the borders was little better than
                    that of the Highlands; but it engaged the attention of Angus more, as he had
                    great intereſt in theſe parts. Marching, therefore, againſt the banditti which
                    infeſted theſe parts, he ſoon reduced them to reaſon. His power ſeemed now to be
                    firmly eſtabliſhed,<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0017.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0011"/> inſomuch that the archbiſhop of St Andrew’s
                    began to treat with Sir George Douglas, to whom he offered lucrative leaſes and
                    other emoluments if he would intercede with the regent, as Angus was called, in
                    his favour. This was readily agreed to; and the archbiſhop was allowed to return
                    in ſafety to his palace about the ſame time that Angus returned from his
                    expedition againſt the borderers. Nothing was then ſeen at court but feſtivities
                    of every kind, in which the queen-mother, who was new relieved from her
                    confinement, took part: and ſhe was afterwards ſuffered to depart to the caſtle
                    of Stirling; which Angus, not attending to its value, had neglected to ſecure.
                    In the mean time the archbiſhop invited the Douglaſſes to ſpend ſome days with
                    him at his caſtle; which they accordingly did, and carried the king along with
                    them. Here James diſſembled ſo well, and ſeemed to be ſo enamoured of his new
                    way of life, that Angus thought there could be no danger in leaving him in the
                    hands of his friends till he ſhould return to Lothian to ſettle ſome public as
                    well as private affairs. Having taken leave of the king, he left him in the
                    cuſtody of his uncle Archibald, his brother Sir George, and one James Douglas of
                    Parkhead, who was captain of the guards that watched his majeſty on pretence of
                    doing him honour. The earl was no ſooner gone than the archbiſhop ſent an
                    invitation to Sir George Douglas, deſiring him to come to St Andrew's, and there
                    put the laſt hand to the leaſes, and finiſh the bargains that had been ſpoken of
                    between them. This was ſo plauſible, that he immediately ſet out for St
                    Andrew’s; while his uncle the treaſurer went to Dundee, where he had an amour.
                    James thinking this to be the beſt opportunity that ever preſented to him for an
                    eſcape, reſolved to avail himſelf of it at all events; and found means, by a
                    private meſſage, to appriſe his mother of his deſign. It was then the ſeaſon for
                    hunting and diverſion, which James often followed in the park of Falkland; and
                    calling for his forreſter, he told him, that as the weather was fine, he
                    intended to kill a ſtag next morning, ordering him at the ſame time to ſummon
                    all the gentlemen in the neighbourhood to attend him with their beſt dogs. He
                    then called for his chief domeſtics, and commanded them to get his ſupper early,
                    becauſe he intended to be in the field by day-break; and he talked with the
                    captain of his guard of nothing but the excellent ſport he expected next
                    morning. In the mean time, he had engaged two young men, the one a page of his
                    own, the other John Hart, a helper about his ſtables, to attend him in his
                    flight, and to provide him with the dreſs of a groom for a diſguiſe. Having
                    formally taken leave of his attendants, charging them to be ready early in the
                    morning, and being left alone, he ſtole ſoftly out of his bed-chamber, went to
                    the ſtable unperceived by the guards, dreſſed himſelf in his diſguiſe; and he
                    and his companions mounting the three beſt horſes there, galloped to Stirling
                    caſtle; into which, by the queen’s appointment, he was admitted ſoon alter
                    day-break. He commanded all the gates to be ſecured; and the queen having
                    previouſly prepared every thing for a vigorous defence, orders were given that
                    none ſhould be admitted into the caſtle without the king’s permiſſion.</p>
                <p>About an hour after the king eſcaped from Falkland, Sir George Douglas returned;
                    and being aſſured that his majeſty was aſleep, he went to bed. It appears that
                    James had been ſeen and known in his flight; for in the morning the bailiff of
                    Abernethy came poſt-haſte to inform Sir George that the king had paſſed Stirling
                    bridge. They had, however, ſome glimmering hope that the king might be gone to
                    Bambrigh: but that ſurmiſe was ſoon found to be falſe; and an expreſs was
                    diſpatched, informing Angus of all that had happened. The earl quickly repaired
                    to Falkland, where he and his friends came to a reſolution of going to Stirling,
                    and demanding acceſs to the king.</p>
                <p>James by this time had iſſued letters to the earls of Huntley, Argyle, Athol,
                    Glencairn, Menteith, Rothes, and Eglinton; the lords Graham, Levingſton,
                    Lindſay, Sinclair, Ruthven, Drummond, Evandale, Maxwell, and Semple. Before all
                    of them could arrive at Stirling, the earl of Angus and his friends were upon
                    their journey to the ſame place; but were ſtopped by a herald at arms,
                    commanding them on their allegiance not to approach within ſix miles of the
                    king’s reſidence. This order having ſufficiently intimated what they were to
                    expect, the earl deliberated with his party how to proceed. Some of them were
                    for marching on and taking the caſtle by ſurpriſe: but that was found to be
                    impracticable, eſpecially as they had no artillery. The earl and his brother
                    therefore reſolved to make a ſhow of ſubmiſſion to the king’s order; and they
                    accordingly went to Linlithgow. By this time all the nobility already mentioned,
                    and many others, had aſſembled at Stirling; and James, calling them to council,
                    inveighed againſt the tyranny of the Douglaſſes with an acrimony that
                    ſufficiently diſcovered what pain it muſt have given him when he was obliged to
                    bear it in ſilence. He concluded his ſpeech with theſe words: “Therefore I
                    deſire, my lords, that I may be ſatisfied of the ſaid earl, his kin, and
                    friends. For I vow that Scotland ſhall not hold us both, while I be revenged on
                    him and his.”</p>
                <p>The reſult of the council’s deliberation was, that proclamation ſhould be made,
                    renewing the order for the Douglaſſes not to approach the court, and diveſting
                    the earl of Angus and his brother of all their public employments. In the mean
                    time, ſuch was the moderation of the aſſembly, that by their advice James
                    ordered the earl to retire to the north of the Spey till his pleaſure ſhould be
                    known; but his brother was commanded to ſurrender himſelf a priſouer in the
                    caſtle of Edinburgh, to take his trial in a very full parliament (all the
                    members being ſummoned to attend), to be held in that city next September. The
                    earl and his brother conſidered their compliance with thoſe conditions as a
                    prelude to their deſtruction; and reſolved to juſtify their treaſons by ſtill
                    greater exceſſes, in ſurpriſing the town of Edinburgh, and holding it againſt
                    the king and parliament, before the latter could aſſemble. Hiſtorians have not
                    done that juſtice to the proceedings of the royal party on this occaſion which
                    they deſerve. The management of the king’s eſcape, his reception into Stirling,
                    the fortifying that caſtle, and the ready obedience of his great nobility, ſome
                    of whom attended him with their followers before they received any ſummonſes for
                    that purpoſe, are proofs of wiſe and ſpirited deliberations. Their conduct at
                    this time was equally conſiflent with the ſame plan of foreſight.</p>
                <p>It was naturally to be ſuppoſed that the Douglaſſes, who remained aſſembled in a
                    numerous body, would<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0018.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0012"/> make the attempt already mentioned; but the
                    royaliſts had the precaution to diſpatch the Lord Maxwell and the baron of
                    Lochinvar, with a body of troops, to take poſſeſſion of the town, till James
                    could arrive with 2000 forces to their relief. Maxwell and Lochinvar made ſuch
                    diſpatch, that they were in poſſeſſion of the town when the Douglaſſes appeared
                    before it, and repulſed them; while a moſt terrible ſtorm had ſcattered the
                    troops under James before he could come to their aſſiſtance, ſo effectually,
                    that, being left almoſt without attendants, his perſon might have been taken by
                    the ſmalleſt party of the enemy. Upon the retreat of the Douglaſſes from
                    Edinburgh, the parhament met; and none of them appearing in purſuance of their
                    ſummons, the earl of Angus, his brother Sir George Douglas, his uncle Archibald
                    Douglas, and Alexander Drummond of Carnock, with ſome of their chief dependents,
                    were indicted and forfeited for the following offences: “The aſſembling of the
                    king’s lieges, with intention to have aſſailed his perſon; the detaining of the
                    king againſt his will and pleaſure, and contrary to the articles agreed upon,
                    for the ſpace of two years and more; all which time the king was in fear and
                    danger of his life.” We know of no advocate for the earl and his friends but one
                    Banantyne, who had the courage to plead their cauſe againſt thoſe heinous
                    charges; and ſo exaſperated were both the king and parliament againſt them, that
                    the former ſwore he never would forgive them, and the latter that they never
                    would intercede for their pardon. Thus it was not deemed ſufficient ſimply to
                    declare their reſolutions; but the ſolemnity of oaths was added with an
                    intention to diſcourage the king of England from continuing the vigorous
                    applications he was every day making, by letters and otherwiſe, for the pardon
                    of Angus; and to ſhut out all hopes of that kind, James created his mother’s
                    third huſband (to whom ſhe had been married for ſome time) lord Methven, and
                    gave him the direction of his artillery.</p>
                <p>The diſgrace and forfeiture of the Douglaſſes having created many vacancies in
                    the ſtate, Gavin Dunbar, archbiſhop of Glaſgow, and tutor to the king, was
                    nominated lord chancellor, though but indifferently qualified for a poſt that
                    ought to have been filled by an able, ſtateſman; and Robert Carncroſs, a perſon
                    (ſays Buchanan) more eminent for wealth than virtue, was made treaſurer: but
                    this laſt was ſoon after diſplaced, being ſuſpected of favouring the Douglaſſes;
                    and Robert Barton, one of the king’s favourites, was appointed to ſucceed him.
                    The Douglaſſes ſtill kept their arms; and being joined by a great number of
                    outlaws and robbers in the ſouth, they ravaged all the lands of their enemies,
                    carrying their devaſtations to the very gates of Edinburgh. A commiſſion of
                    lieutenancy was offered to the earl of Bothwell to act againſt thoſe rebels: but
                    he declining it, it was accepted by the earl of Argyle and lord Hume, who did
                    great ſervice in protecting the country from the outlaws. Several villages,
                    however, in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, were burnt; and all the proviſions
                    the Douglaſſes could find were carried off to their caſtle of Tantallon, which
                    now ſerved as their head-quarters, and was threatened with a ſiege.</p>
                <p>It is remarkable, that the caſtle of Dunbar remained ſtill in the hands of the
                    duke of Albany’s garriſon, who recogniſed no maſter but him. The place was well
                    ſtored with artillery of all kinds; and lying in the neighbourhood of Tantallon,
                    it was eaſy to tranſport them to the ſiege: but James thought he had no right to
                    make uſe of them without the conſent of one Maurice, governor of the caſtle.
                    Having ſummoned, by proclamation, the inhabitants of Fife, Angus, Stratfiern,
                    Stirlingſhire, Lothian, Merſe, and Teviotdale, to be ready to compear at
                    Edinburgh on the 10th of December, with 40 days victuals, to aſſiſt in the
                    ſiege, he ſent three noblemen to borrow artillery from Maurice, and to remain as
                    pledges for the ſafe redelivery of the ſame; and the ſeveral pieces required
                    were accordingly ſent him. This delicacy is the more remarkable, as we are told
                    that the duke of Albany had given orders that every thing in his caſtle ſhould
                    be at the king’s ſervice. However unanimous the parliament might appear againſt
                    the Douglaſſes, yet James was but ill-ſeconded in this attempt. The unfortunate,
                    if ſeverely proceeded againſt, generally find friends; and the enemies of the
                    Douglaſſes had impolitically rendered it treaſonable for any perſon to ſhelter
                    or protect the earl of Angus, his kinsmen, or followers. This proceeding, in a
                    country where the Douglaſſes had ſo many connections, carried with it an
                    appearance of cruelty and a thirſt of revenge, eſpecially as James had choſen
                    ſuch a ſeaſon of the year for carrying on the ſiege. In ſhort, after battering
                    the place for ſome days, and loſing one Falconer, his chief engineer, the king
                    was obliged to abandon his enterpriſe, or rather to turn the ſiege into a
                    blockade, with no great credit to his firſt eſſiry in the field. Some hiſtorians
                    intimate, that Angus found means to corrupt the other engineers; but we find,
                    that before this time, a negociation was going forward between James and the
                    king of England; the nature of which proves that the former was now rendered
                    more placable towards the Douglaſſes, and was the true reaſon why the ſiege was
                    ſuſpended.</p>
                <p>The truce between Scotland and England was now- near expiring; and Henry, under
                    that pretence, gave a commiſſion to the prior of Durham, Thomas Magnus, Sir
                    Anthony Ughtred captain of the town and caſtle of Berwick, William Frankelyn
                    chancellor of Durham, and Sir Thomas Tempeſt. James ſeems to have been in no
                    haſte to enter upon this negociation, becauſe he underſtood that the Engliſh
                    commiſſioners were privately inſtructed to inſiſt upon the Douglaſſes being
                    reſtored to their eſtates and dignities. England was at that time the principal
                    ally of Francis againſt the emperor; and this gave a handle for Francis to
                    interpoſe ſo far in favour of the Douglaſſes, that he brought James to conſent
                    to a preliminary negociation for their obtaining at leaſt a ſecure retreat in
                    England. This was at laſt complied with.</p>
                <p>James being now delivered from all dread of the Douglaſſes, and under no controul
                    from any party, ſhowed excellent dſſpoſitions for government. Finding that the
                    borderers were by no means pleaſed with the late treaty, and that they were
                    renewing their depredations, he reſolved to ſtrike at the root of an evil which
                    had ſo long proved diſgraceful and dangerous to his anceſtors, by giving no
                    quarter to the chiefs of theſe robbers, whoſe principal reſidence was in
                    Liddeſdale. This was the more neceſſary, as their daring attempts had
                    exaſperated the Engliſh ſo much, that they had actually burnt a town in
                    Teviotdale; and they had killed one Robert<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0019.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0013"/> Kerr, a man of ſome conſequence. Two of the
                    chiefs of the Scotch borderers were Cockburn of Kenderlaw, and Adam Scot,
                    commonly called <hi rend="italic">king oſ the thieves.</hi> Both of them were
                    barons; and had been ſo inured to the practice, that they thought there was no
                    crime in robbing: they therefore appeared publicly in Edinburgh; where James
                    ordered them to be apprehended, tried, and hanged. He next proceeded with great
                    firmneſs againſt many noblemen and principal gentlemen, who were only ſuſpected
                    oſ being diſaffected to the late peace. All of them had behaved with great
                    loyalty, and ſome of them had done him the moſt important ſervices. Of this
                    number were the earl of Hume, the lord Maxwell, with the barons of Buccleugh,
                    Farniherſt, Polwart, Johnſton, and Mark Kerr. Though we know nothing
                    particularly of what was laid to the charge of thoſe noblemen and gentlemen, yet
                    ſo zealous was James for the impartial adminiſtration of juſtice, that he
                    ordered them all, with many other chief gentlemen of the borders, to be ſent to
                    priſon; where they lay till they entered into recognizances themſelves, and
                    found bail for their good behaviour.</p>
                <p>Of all the party of the Douglaſſes, none of any note excepting Alexander Drummond
                    of Carnock was ſuffered to return home, at the earneſt requeſt of the
                    ambaſſadors and the treaſurer Barton. This lenity was of very little
                    conſequence; for James having appointed the earl oſ Murray to be ſole warden of
                    the Scotch marches, with power to treat with the earl of Northumberland, their
                    conferences had broken off on account of freſh violences happening every day;
                    and ſome information he had received from them, had prevailed with James to
                    impriſon the noblemen and gentlemen we have already mentioned. He now reſolved
                    to attempt in perſen what his predeceſſors and he had ſo often failed in by
                    their deputies. As he was known to be violently addicted to hunting, he ſummoned
                    his nobility, even on the north oſ the Forth, to attend him with their horſes
                    and dogs; which they did in ſuch numbers, that his hunting retinue conſiſted of
                    above 8000 perſons, two-thirds of whom were well armed. This preparation gave no
                    ſuſpicion to the borderers, as great hunting-matches in thoſe days commonly
                    conſiſted of ſome thouſands; and James having ſet out upon his diverſion, is
                    ſaid to have killed 540 deer. Among the other gentlemen who had been ſummoned to
                    attend him, was John Armſtrong of Gilnockhall. He was the head of a numerous
                    clan, who lived with great pomp and ſplendour upon the contributions under which
                    they laid the Engliſh on the borders. He was himſelf always attended by twenty-
                    ſix gentlemen on norſeback, well mounted and armed, as his body-guards. Having
                    received the king’s invitation, he was fond of diſplaying his magnificence to
                    his ſovereign; and attiring himſelf and his guard more pompouſly than uſual,
                    they preſented themſelves before James, from whom they expected ſome particular
                    mark of diſtinction for their ſervices againſt the Engliſh, and for the
                    remarkable protection they had always given to their countrymen the Scots. On
                    their firſt appearance, James, not knowing who he was, returned Armſtrong’s
                    ſalute, imagining him to be ſome great no</p>
                <p>bleman; but upon hearing his name, he ordered him and his followers to be
                    immediately apprehended, and ſentenced them to be hanged upon the ſpot. It is
                    ſaid that James, turning to his attendants, aſked them, pointing at Armſtrong,
                    "What does that knave want that a king ſhould have, but a crown and a ſword oſ
                    honour?” Armſtrong begged hard for his life; and offered to ſerve the king in
                    the field with forty horſemen, beſides making him large preſents of jewels and
                    money, with many other tempting offers. Finding the king inexorable, “Fool that
                    I am (ſaid he) to look for warm water under ice, by aſking grace of a graceleſs
                    face and then he and his followers ſubmitted to their fate. Thoſe and ſome other
                    executions of the ſame kind reſtored peace to the borders.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hitherto</hi> we have conſidered only the civil tranſactions
                    of Scotland; but henceforth religion will claim a conſiderable ſhare of the
                    hiſtorian’s attention. The opinions of Luther had been propagated in. Britain
                    ſoon after his preaching in 1517. They had for ſome years inſenlibly gained
                    ground; and, at the time the contentions began between James and his nobility,
                    were become formidable to the eſtabliſhed religion. We have ſeen how James
                    eſcaped from the hands of his nobles by means of the archbiſhop of St. Andrew’s.
                    To the clergy, therefore, he was naturally favourable; and as they of neceſſity
                    oppoſed the reformation, James became a zealous perſecutor of the reformed. On
                    the other hand, the nobility having already oppoſed the king and clergy in civil
                    affairs, did ſo likewiſe in thoſe of religion. The clergy finding themſelves
                    unequal in argument, had recourſe to more violent methods. Rigorous inquiſitions
                    were made after heretics, and fires were everywhere prepared for them.</p>
                <p>The firſt perſon who was called upon to ſuffer for the reformed religion was
                    Patrick Hamilton, abbot of Ferne. At an early period of life he had been
                    appointed to this abbacy; and having imbibed a favourable idea of the doctrines
                    of Luther, he had travelled into Germany, where, becoming acquainted with the
                    moſt eminent reformers, he was fully confirmed in their opinions. Upon his
                    return to Scotland, he ventured to expoſe the corruptions of the church, and to
                    inſiſt oa tire advantages of the tenets which he had embraced. A conduct ſo
                    bold, and the avidity with which his diſcourſes were received by the people,
                    gave an alarm to tha clergy. Under the pretence of a religious and friendly
                    conference, he was ſeduced to St Andrew’s by Alexander Campbell, a dominican
                    friar, who was inſtructed to remonſtrate with him on the ſubject of the
                    reformation. The converſations they held only ſerved to eſtabliſh the abbot more
                    firmly in his ſentiments, and to inflame his zeal to propagate them. The
                    archbiſhop of St Andrew’s, the archbiſhop of Glaſgow, and other dignitaries of
                    the church, conſtituting a court, called him to appear before them.</p>
                <p>The abbot neither loſt his courage nor renounced his opinions. He was convicted
                    accordingly of heretical pravity, delivered over to the ſecular arm, and
                    executed in the year 1527<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom"

                            are in grace. No man is juſtified by works, but by faith only. Good
                            works make not a good man, but a good man doth make good works. And
                            faith, hope, and charity, are ſo knit, that he that hath the one hath
                            the reſt; and he that wanteth the one of them wanteth the reft.” <hi

                    of his age. His youth, his virtue, his magnanimity, and his ſufferings, all
                    operated in his favour with the people. To Alexander Campbell, who inſulted him
                    at the ſtake, he objected his treachery, and cited him to anſwer for his
                    behaviour before the judgement-ſeat of Chriſt. And this perſecutor, a few days
                    after, being ſeized with a frenzy, and dying in that condition, it was believed
                    with the greater ſincerity and confidence, that Mr Hamilton was an innocent man
                    and a true martyr.</p>
                <p>A deed ſo affecting, from its novelty and in its circumſtances, excited
                    throughout the kingdom an univerſal curioſity and indignation. Minute and
                    particular inquiries were made into the tenets of Mr Hamilton. Converts to the
                    new opinions were multiplying in every quarter, and a partiality to them began
                    to prevail even among the Romiſh clergy themſelves. Alexander Seton, the king’s
                    confeſſor, took the liberty to inveigh againſt the errors and abuſes of Popery;
                    to neglect, in his diſcourſes, all mention of purgatory, and pilgrimages, and
                    ſaints; and to recommend the doctrines of the reformed. What he taught was
                    impugned; and his boldneſs riſing with contradiction, he defended warmly his
                    opinions, and even ventured to affirm, that in Scotland there were no true and
                    faithful biſhops, if a judgement of men in this ſtation is to be formed from the
                    virtues which St Paul has required of them. A ſarcaſm ſo juſt, and ſo daring,
                    inflamed the whole body of the prelacy with reſentment. They ſtudied to compaſs
                    his deſtruction; and, as Mr Seton had given offence to the king, whom he had
                    exhorted to a greater purity of life, they flattered themſelves with the hope of
                    conducting him to the ſtake; but, being apprehenſive of danger, he made his
                    eſcape into England.</p>
                <p>In 1533, Henry Foreſt, abenedictine friar, who diſcovered a propenſity to the
                    reformed doctrines, was not ſo fortunate. After having been imprisoned for ſome
                    time in the tower of St Andrew’s, he was brought to his trial, condemned, and
                    led out to the flames. He had ſaid, that Mr Hamilton was a pious man, and a
                    martyr; and that the tenets for which he ſuffered might be vindicated. This
                    guilt was aggravated by the diſcovery that friar Foreſt was in poſſeſſion of a
                    New Teſtament in the Engliſh language; for the prieſts eſteemed a careful
                    attention to the Scriptures to be an infallible ſymptom of hereſy. A cruelty ſo
                    repugnant to the common ſenſe and feelings of mankind, while it pleaſed the
                    inſolent pride of the eccleſiaſtics, was destroying their importance, and
                    exciting a general diſpoſition in the people to adopt in the fulleſt latitude
                    the principles and ſentiments of the reformed.</p>
                <p>The following year, James Beaton archbiſhop of St Andrew’s, though remarkable for
                    prudence and moderation, was overawed by his nephew and coadjutor David Beaton,
                    and by the clergy. In his own perſon, or by commiſſion granted by him,
                    persecutions were carried on with violence. Many were driven into baniſhment,
                    and many were forced to acknowledge what they did not believe. The more
                    ſtrenuous and reſolute were delivered over to puniſhiment. Among theſe were two
                    private gentlemen, Norman Gourlay and David Straton. They were tried at
                    Holyroodhouſe before the biſhop of Roſs; and refuſing to recant, were condemned.
                    King James, who was preſent, appeared exceedingly ſolicitous that they ſhould
                    recant their opinions; and David Straton, upon being adjudged to the fire,
                    having begged for his mercy, was about to receive it, when the prieſts proudly
                    pronounced, that the grace of the ſovereign could not be extended to a criminal
                    whom their law and determination had doomed to ſuffer.</p>
                <p>A few years after, the biſhops having aſſembled at Edinburgh, two Dominican
                    friars, Killor and Beverage, with Sir Duncan Sympſon a prieſt, Robert Forreſter
                    a gentleman of Stirling, and Thomas Forreſt vicar of Dolour in Perthſhire, were
                    condemned to be conſumed in the ſame fire.</p>
                <p>At Glaſgow, a ſimilar ſcene was acted in 1539 s Hieronymus Ruffel a gray-friar,
                    and a young gentleman of the name of Kennedy, were accuſed of hereſy before the
                    biſhop of that fee. Ruffel, when brought to the ſtake, diſplaying a deliberate
                    demeanour, reaſoned gravely with his accuſers, and was only anſwered with
                    reproaches. Mr Kennedy, who was not yet 18 years of age, ſeemed diſpoſed to
                    diſavow his opinions, and to ſink under the weight of a cruel affliction; but
                    the exhortation and example of Ruffel awakening his courage, his mind aſſumed a
                    firmneſs and conſtancy, his countenance became cheerful, and he exclaimed with a
                    joyful voice, “Now, I defy thee, Death; I praiſe my God, I am ready.”</p>
                <p>James Beaton, the archbiſhop of St Andrew’s, having died about this time, the
                    ambition of David Beaton, his coadjutor, was gratiſied in the fulleſt manner. He
                    had before been created a cardinal of the Roman church, and he was now advanced
                    into the poſſeſſion of the primacy of Scotland. No Scottiſh eccleſiaſtic had
                    been ever inveſted with greater authority; and the reformers had every thing to
                    fear from ſo formidable an enemy. The natural violence of his temper had fixed
                    itſelf in an overbearing inſolence, from the ſucceſs which had attended him. His
                    youth had been paſſed in ſcenes of policy and intrigue, which, while they
                    communicated to him addreſs and the knowledge of men, corrupted altogether the
                    ſimplicity and candour of his mind. He was dark, deſigning, and artificial.’ No
                    principles of juſtice were any bar to his ſchemes; nor did his heart open to any
                    impreſſions of pity. His ruling paſſion was an inordinate love of power; and the
                    fupport of his conſequence depending alone upon the church of Rome, he was
                    animated to maintain its ſuperſtitions with the warmeſt zeal. He ſeemed to take
                    a delight in peridiouſneſs and diſſimulation: he had no religion; and he was
                    ſtained with an inhuman cruelty,<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0021.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0015"/> and the moſt open profligacy of manners. In
                    connection with theſe defects, he poſſeſſed a perſevering obſtinacy in purſuing
                    his meaſures, the ability to perceive and to practiſe all the arts which were
                    neceſſary to advance them, and the allurements of oſtentation and
                    prodigality.</p>
                <p>He was ſcarcely inveſted in the primacy, when he exhibited an example of his
                    taſte for magnificence, and of his averſion to the reformed. He proceeded to St
                    Andrew’s with an uncommon pomp and parade. The earls of Huntley, Arran,
                    Mariſchal, and Montroſe, with the lords Fleming, Lindſey, Erſkine, and Seton,
                    honoured him with their attendance; and there appeared in his train, Gavin
                    archbiſhop of Glaſgow and lord high chancellor, four biſhops, ſix abbots, a
                    great many private gentlemen, and a vaſt multitude of the inferior clergy. In
                    the cathedral church of St Andrew’s, from a throne erected by his command, he
                    harangued concerning the ſtate of religion and the church, to this company, and
                    to a crowd of other auditors. Hc lamented the increaſe of heretics; he inſiſted
                    upon their audacity and contempt of order; he ſaid, that even in the court of
                    the ſovereign too much attention was ſhown to them; and he urged the ſtrong
                    neceſſity of acting againſt them with the greateſt rigour. He informed this
                    aſſembly, that he had cited Sir John Borthwick to appear before it, for
                    maintaining tenets of faith hoſtile to the church, and for diſperſing heretical
                    books; and he deſired that he might be aſſiſted in bringing him to juſtice. The

                    accordingly read againſt him; but he neither appeared in his. own perſon, nor by
                    any agent or deputy. He was found, notwithſtanding, to be guilty; and the
                    cardinal, with a ſolemnity calculated to ſtrike with awe and terror, pronounced
                    ſentence againſt him. His goods and eſtate were confiſcated; a painted
                    repreſentation of him was burned publicly, in teſtimony of the malediction of
                    the church, and as a memorial of his obſtinacy and condemnation. It was
                    ordained, that in the event of his being apprehended, he ſhould ſuffer as a
                    heretic, without hope of grace or mercy. All Chriſtians, whether men or women,
                    and of whatever degree or condition, were prohibited from affording him any
                    harbour or ſuſtenance. It was declared, that every office of humanity, comfort,
                    and ſolacement, extended to him, ſhould be conſidered as criminal, and be
                    paniſhed with conſifcations and forfeitures.</p>
                <p>Sir John Borthwick having been appriſed of his danger, fled into England; where
                    he was kindly received by Henry VII1. who employed him in negociations with the
                    Proteſtant princes of Germany. Cardinal Beaton perceived with concern that this
                    act of ſeverity did not terrify the people. New defections from the church were
                    announced to him. Andrew Cunningham ſon to the maſter of Glencairn, James
                    Hamilton brother to Patrick Hamilton the martyr, and the celebrated George
                    Buchanan the hiſtorian, were impriſoned upon ſuſpicions of hereſy; and, if they
                    had not found means to eſcape, mult have died at the ſtake. In this declining
                    condition of Popery, the cardinal held many mournful conſultations with the
                    biſhops. All their intrigues and wiſdom were employed to deviſe methods to
                    ſupport themſelves. The project of an inquiſitorial court was conceived, and
                    exhibited a diſtant view of the extirpation of heretics. To erect this tribunal,
                    they allured James V. with the hopes of the confiſcation and ſpoils, which might
                    enrich him, from the perſecution and puniſhment of the reformed. He yielded
                    himſelf to their ſolicitations, and gave them the ſanction of his authority.</p>
                <p>A formal commiſſion was granted, conſtituting a court of inquiry after heretics,
                    and nominating for its preſident Sir James Hamilton of Fennard, natural brother
                    to the earl of Arran. The officious aſſiduity of this man, his ambition, and his
                    thirſt of blood, were acceptable in a high degree to the clergy; and to this bad
                    eminence their recommendation had promoted him. Upon the ſlighteſt ſuſpicion he
                    was allowed to call any perſon before him, to ſcrutinize into his creed, and to
                    abſolve or to condemn him. A tribunal ſo dreadful could not have found a
                    director more ſuited to it. He was in haſte to fill the priſons of the kingdom
                    with culprits, and was marking down in lifts the names of all thoſe to whom
                    hereſy was imputed by popular report, and whom the arts of malicious men had
                    repreſented as the objects of correction and puniſhment. But, while he was

                    over miſchief, and multiplying in fancy the triumphs of his wickedneſs, an
                    unexpected turn of affairs preſented himſelf in the light of a criminal, and
                    conducted him to the ſcaffold.</p>
                <p>The brother of Mr Hamilton the martyr, to avoid perſecution, had been obliged to
                    go into baniſhment; but, by the interceſſion of his friends, he was permitted to
                    return for a ſhort time to his own country, that he might regulate the affairs
                    of his family. He was connected with Sir James Hamilton; and, truſting to the
                    ties of blood, ventured to prolong his ſtay beyond the period allotted to him.
                    This treſpaſs was trivial. Sir James Hamilton, being willing to give a ſignal
                    example oſ ſeverity, and by this means to ingratiate himſelf the more with the
                    prieſthood, took the reſolution to make his own relation the firſt victim of his
                    power. Mr Hamilton, attentive to his perſonal ſecurity, and not unacquainted
                    with the moſt private machinations of this inquiſitor, diſpatched his ſon to the
                    king, who was about to paſs the Forth in a barge, and intreated him to provide
                    for his ſafety, as Sir James Hamilton had conſpired with the horde of Douglas to
                    aſſaſſinate him. James V. being at variance with the houſe of Douglas, had
                    reaſons of ſuſpſicion, and was diſpoſed to believe every thing that is moſt
                    flagitious of Sir James Hamilton. He inſtructed the young gentleman to go with
                    expedition to Edinburgh, and to open the matter to the privy-council; and that
                    he might be treated with the greater reſpect, he furniſhed him with the ring
                    which he was accuſtomed to ſend to them upon thoſe important occaſions which
                    required their addreſs and activity. Sir James Hamilton was apprehended and
                    impriſoned. An accuſation of having deviſed and attempted the king’s death at
                    different times, was preferred againſt him. His defence appeared to be weak and
                    unſatisſactory. A jury, which conſiſted of men of rank and character, pronounced
                    him guilty; and, being condemned to ſuffer the death of a traitor, he loſt his
                    head, and the quarters of his body were expoſed upon the gates of the city of
                    Edinburgh. The clergy, who could not prevent his trial and execution, regretted
                    his death, but did not think of appointing a ſucceſſor to him in their court of
                    inquiſition.</p>
                <p>In other reſpects, however, James ſhowed great concern for the welfare of his
                    people. Being diſſatisfied with the ordinary adminiſtration of juſtice, he had
                    recourſe to the parliament of Paris for a model of the like inſtitution in
                    Scotland. Great objections lay to juries in civil matters, and to ambulatory
                    courts of juſtice. The authority of the heritable juriſdictions was almoſt
                    excluſive of all law; for though the king might preſide in them, yet he ſeldom
                    did; and appeals before the council were diſagreeable and expenſive. The
                    inſtitution of the lords of articles threw too much weight into their ſcale, as
                    no buſineſs could be tranſacted in parliament but what they allowed of and
                    prepared; and it was always in the power of the crown to direct them as the king
                    pleaſed. The true ſource of the public grievances, in matters of property, lay
                    in the diſregard ſhown to the excellent acts which had paſſed during the reigns
                    of the three firſt James’s, and which had not been ſufficiently ſupported in the
                    late reigns. The evil had gathered ſtrength during the minority of James V.; and
                    he relolved to eſtabliſh a Handing jury</p>
                <p>for all matters of law and equity (for, properly speaking, the court of ſeſſion
                    in Scotland is no other), with a preſident, who was to be the mouth of the
                    aſſembly. On the 13th of May, this year, as we find by a curious manuſeript in
                    the Britiſh muſeum, the lords of the articles laid before the parliament the
                    propoſition for inſtituting this court, in the following words: “Item, anent
                    (concerning) the ſecond artickel concerning the order of juſtice; becauſe our
                    ſovereign lord is maiſt deſirous to have an permanent order of juſtice for the
                    univerſal of all his liege; and therefore tends to inſtitute an college of
                    cunning and wile men for doing and adminiſtration of juſtice in all civil
                    actions: and therefore thinke to be choſen certain perlons maiſt convenient and
                    qualified yair (there), to the number of fifteen. perſons, half ſpiritual, half
                    temporal, with an preſident.”</p>
                <p>In the year 1533, hoſtilities were recommenced with England; but after ſome
                    flight incursions on both sides, a trupe again took place. The molt remarkable
                    tranſactions of theſe years, however, next to the religious perſecutions already
                    mentioned, were the negociations for the king’s marriage. Indeed, there is
                    ſcarce any monarch mentioned in hiſtory who ſeems to have had a greater variety
                    of choices, or who was more difficult to be pleaſed. The ſituation of affairs on
                    the continent of Europe, had rendered Scotland a kingdom of great conſequenee,
                    as holding the balance between France, England, and the emperor of Germany; and
                    each of the rival powers endeavoured to gain the favour of James, by giving him
                    a wife.— In 1534, king Francis offered him his daughter; and the match was
                    ſtrongly recommended by the duke of Albany, who was ſtill living in France, and
                    ſerved James with great fidelity. The ſame year the Imperial ambaffador arrived
                    in Scotland, and preſented, in the name of his maſter, the order of the golden
                    fleece to James, who had already been inveſted with that of St Michael by
                    Francis. At the ſame time, he offered him his choice of three princeſſes; Mary
                    of Auſtria, the emperor’s ſiſter, and widow of Lewis king of Hungary; Mary of
                    Portugal, the daughter of his ſiſter Eleonora of Auſtria; or Mary of England,
                    the daughter of Catharine and Henry. Another condition, however, was annexed to
                    this propoſal, viz. that, to ſuppreſs the hereſies of the time, a council ſhould
                    be held for obviating the calamities which threatened the Chriſtian religion.
                    Thoſe propoſals would have met with a mote ready acceptance from James, had not
                    his clergy, at this time, been diſguſted with Charles, for allowing too great a
                    latitude to the Proteſtants of Germany. James, in his anſwer, returned the
                    emperor his acknowledgments in the moſt polite terms, for the ſplendid alliances
                    he had offered him. He touched the propoſal of the council as being a meaſure
                    rather to be wiſhed for than hoped, becauſe it ought to be free and holy, and
                    upon the model of the firſt councils ; its members conſiſting of the moſt
                    charitable, quiet, and diſintereſted part of the clergy. He ſaid, that if ſuch a
                    council could be obtained, he would willingly ſend ecclcfiaſtics to it; but if
                    not, that every prince ought to reform the errors of doctrine, and the faults of
                    the clergy, within his own dominions. He bewailed the obſtinate conduct of his
                    uncle in his divorce and marriage; and offered his beſt offices for effecting a
                    reconciliation between him and the emperor,<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0023.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0017"/> wiſhing that
                    all the princes of Chriſtendom would unite their arms againſt their common enemy
                    the Turks, He hinted, very juſtly, that his Imperial majeſty had offered more
                    than he could perform, becauſe his couſin, Mary of England, was not at his
                    diſpoſal. The ambaſſador replied, that his maſter, it perſuaſions failed, would
                    compel Henry by force of arms to reſign her. James anſwered this ridiculous
                    declaration by obſerving, that the emperor then would be guilty of a breach of
                    all laws both divine and human; that it would be impolitic to give a preference
                    to any of the three princeſſes, all of them being ſo illuſtrious and deſerving;
                    but, to ſhow how much he valued an alliance with his Imperial majeſty, he would
                    become a ſuppliant to that prince for his niece, daughter to Chriſtſern king of
                    Denmark, to become his bride. The ambaſſador’s anſwer to this unexpected requeſt
                    was, that ſhe was already betrothed to the count palatine, and that before that
                    time the marriage was probably conſummated;</p>
                <p>But whether the Imperial ambaſſador had any right to offer the Engliſh princeſs
                    or not, it is agreed by moſt hiſtorians, that he was offered either Mary or
                    Elizabeth by their father Henry himſelf. To Mary of Bourbon, the daughter of the
                    duke of Vendoſme, he is ſaid to have been contracted; but for ſome reaſon or
                    other all theſe matches were broken off; and the king at laſt went to France,
                    where he married Magdalen the eldeſt daughter of Francis. The nuptials were
                    celebrated at Paris in the year 1537, with great magnificence; and among other
                    things ſerved up by way of deſert at the mariage-feaſt, were a number of covered
                    cups filled with pieces of gold and gold-dull, the native product of Scotland,
                    which James distributed among the gueſts. This gold was found in the mines of
                    Crawford-moor, which were then worked by the Germans. In the beginning of May,
                    the royal pair embarked for Leith, under convoy of four large ſhips of war, and
                    landed on the 28th of the fame month. The joy of the Scots was inexpreſſible,
                    but it was of ſhort continuance; for the young queen died of a fever on the 22d
                    of July the ſame year.</p>
                <p>King James did not long remain a widower; for the ſame year he ſent Beaton abbot
                    of Arbroath, to treat of his ſecond marriage with a French lady, Mary of Guiſe,
                    ducheſs-dowager of Longueville. In this he was rivalled by his uncle Henry VIII.
                    but not before James had been contracted to her. But this was nothing to Henry;
                    for he not only inſiſted upon having this lady for his wife, but threw out ſome
                    menaces againſt Francis, becauſe he would not comply with this unjuſtifiable
                    requeſt. In January 1538, ſhe was married to James, and eſcorted to Scotland by
                    the admiral of France with a conſiderable ſquadron; both James and Francis being
                    ſuſpicious that Henry would make ſome attempt to intercept the royal bride. But
                    nothing of this kind happened, and ſhe landed ſafely at Fifeneſs; from whence
                    ſhe was conducted to the king at St Andrew’s.</p>
                <p>But while James appeared thus to be giving himſelf up to the pleaſures of love,
                    he was in other reſpects ſhowing himſelf a bloody tyrant. Some differences
                    ſubſiſted between the families of Gordon and Forbes in the north. The heir of
                    the houſe laſt-mentioned had been educated in a looſe diſſipated manner, and
                    kept</p>
                <p>company with a worthleſs fellow named <hi rend="italic">Strahan.</hi> Having
                    refuſed this favourite ſomething he had aſked, the latter attached himſelf to
                    Gordon earl of Huntley, who, it is ſaid, aſſiſted him in forming a charge of
                    treaſon againſt Forbes. He was accuſed of intending to reſtore the Douglaſſes to
                    their forfeited eſtates and honours; which improbable ſtory being ſupported by
                    ſome venal evidences, the unhappy young man was condemned and executed as a
                    traitor. The king could not but ſee the injuſtice of this execution; and, in
                    order to make ſome amends for it, baniſhed Strahan the kingdom. The following
                    execution, which happened a few days after, was much more inhuman, inſomuch that
                    it would have ſtained the annals even of the moſt deſpotic tyrants. The earl of
                    Angus, finding that he could not regain the favour of the king, had recourſe to
                    the method uſual in thoſe days, viz. the committing of depredations on the
                    borders. This crime was ſufficient with James to occaſion the death of his
                    innocent ſiſter, the dowager- lady of Glamis. She had been courted by one Lyon,
                    whom ſhe had rejected in favour of a gentleman of the name of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Campbell.</hi> Lyon, exaſperated at his repulſe, found means of admittance
                    to James, whom he filled with the greateſt terrors on account of the practices
                    of the family of Angus; and at laſt charged the lady, her huſband, and an old
                    prieſt, with a deſign of poiſoning the king in order to reſtore Angus. The
                    parties were all remarkable for the quiet and innocent lives they led; and even
                    this circumſtance was by their diabolical accuſer turned to their prejudice, by
                    repreſenting it as the effect of cunning or caution. In this reign an accuſation
                    of treaſon was always followed by condemnation. However, the evidence againſt
                    the lady appeared ſo abſurd and contradictory, that ſome of the judges were for
                    dropping the proſecution, and others for recommending her caſe to the king: but
                    the majority prevailed to have it determined by a jury, who brought her in
                    guilty; and ſhe was condemned to be burnt alive in the Caſtle-hill of Edinburgh.
                    The defence ſhe made would have done honour to the ableſt orator, and undeniably
                    proved her innocence; but tho’ it was reported to James, it was ſo far from
                    mitigating her ſenterce, that it was aggravated by her huſband being obliged to
                    behold her execution. The unhappy husband himſelf endeavoured to make his way
                    over the caſtle-wall of Edinburgh; but the rope proving too ſhort, he was daſhed
                    in pieces: and lord Glands her ſon, though but a child, was impriſoned during
                    the remainder of this reign. The old prieſt, though put to the torture,
                    confeſſed nothing, and was freed. Lyon, like the other acculer already
                    mentioned, was baniſhed the kingdom.</p>
                <p>Whether theſe and other cruelties had affected the king’s conſcience, or whether
                    his brain had been touched by the diffractions of the different parties, is
                    unknown; but it is certain, that, in the year 1540, he began to live retired:
                    his palace appeared like the cloiſtered retreat of monks; his ſleep was haunted
                    by the moſt frightful dreams, which he conſtrued into apparitions; and the body
                    of Sir James Hamilton, whole execution has already been mentioned, ſeemed
                    continually preſent to his eyes. Perhaps the loſs of his two ſons, who died on
                    the ſame day that Sir James was executed, might have contributed to bring this
                    man more remark-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0024.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0018"
                    /> ably to his remembrance. No doubt, it added to the gloom of his mind; and he
                    now ſaw his court abandoned by almoſt all his nobility.</p>
                <p>At laſt James was in ſome degree rouſed from his inaction, by the preparations
                    made againſt him by his uncle Henry VIII. of England. Some differences had
                    already taken place; to accommodate which, Henry had deſired a conference with
                    James at York. But this the latter, by the advice of his parliament, had
                    declined. The conſequetice was a rupture between the two courts, and the Engliſh
                    had taken 20 of the Scots trading veſſels. Henry threatened to revive the
                    antiquated claim of the Engliſh ſuperiority over Scotland, and had given orders
                    for a formidable invaſion of the Scotch borders. He complained that James had
                    uſurped his title of Defender of the Faith, to which he had added the word
                    Chriſtian, implying that Henry was an infidel: but the kings of Scotland had,
                    ſome time before, been complimented by the papal ſee with that title. James, on
                    the other hand, threw his eyes towards Ireland, the north part oſ which was
                    actually peopled with inhabitants who owned no ſovereign but the king of
                    Scotland, and who offered to ſerve James againſt the Engliſh; ſome of their
                    chiefs having actually repaired to Scotland, and done homage to James. Henry
                    had, about this time, declared himſelf king of Ireland, of which he was before
                    only ſtyled the <hi rend="italic">lord;</hi> and James roundly aſſerted, that he
                    had a preferable claim to at leaſt one half of that iſland, which had been
                    peopled by the ſubjects of Scotland. Though the Scotch hiſtorians of this reign
                    take very little notice of this incident, yet James appears to have been very
                    tenacious of his title; and that there was a vaſt intercourſe carried on between
                    the ſubjects of Scotland and the northern Iriſh, who unanimouſly acknowledged
                    James for their natural ſovereign. Indeed, this was the only ground of quarrel
                    that the king, with the leaſt ſhadow of juſtice, could allege againſt Henry.</p>
                <p>His parliament being met, many public-ſpirited acts were paſſed; and before the
                    aſſembly was diſſolved, the members renewed the acts againſt leaſing-making; by
                    which is meant the miſrepreſenting of the king to his nobles, or the nobles to
                    their king: and James, to diſmiſs them in good humour, paſſed an act of free
                    grace for all crimes committed in his minority; the earl of Angus, and Sir
                    George and Sir Archibald Douglas, being excepted.</p>
                <p>Henry, after cutting off the head of his wife Catharine Howard, married and
                    divorced the princeſs Anne of Cleves, and found himſelf either deſerted or
                    diſtruſted by all the princes on the continent, Proteſtant as well as Roman
                    Catholic. James and his clergy relied greatly on this public odium incurred by
                    Henry; but the emperor having again quarrelled with Francis, left Henry, whoſe
                    dominions they had threatened jointly to invade, at liberty to continue his
                    preparations againſt the Scots. He firſt ordered his fleet, then the moſt
                    formidable of any in the world, to make freſh deſcents upon Scotland. At the
                    ſame time, he appointed a very conſiderable army to rendezvous upon the borders,
                    under the command of Sir Robert Bowes, one of his wardens, the earl of Angus,
                    and his two brothers Sir George and Sir Archibald Douglas. James was every day
                    expecting ſupplies of money, arms, and other neceſſarſes from Francis; but theſe
                    not arriving, he reaſſembled his parliament on the 14th of March, which
                    gratified him in all his demands. Many excellent regulations were made for the
                    internal government, peace, and ſecurity of the kingdom, and againſt the
                    exportation of money inſtead of merchandiſe. Acts were paſſed for fortifying and
                    embelliſhing the town of Edinburgh, and for better ſupplying the ſubjects with
                    wine and all the other neceſſaries of life. The royal revenue was increaſed by
                    many additional eſtates; and the laſt hand was put to one of the beſt plans for
                    a national militia that perhaps ever appeared. As yet, excepting in the
                    diſappointment which Henry met with from his nephew in not meeting him at York,
                    he had no grounds for commencing hoſtilities. But it is here proper to obſerve,
                    that the queen mother was then dead; and conſequently the connection between
                    James and Henry was weakened. Whatever her private character might have been,
                    ſhe was certainly a happy instrument of preventing bloodſhed between the two
                    kingdoms. She was buried with royal honours at Perth.</p>
                <p>James, to all appearance, was at this time in a moſt deſirable ſituation. His
                    domain, by forfeitures and otherwiſe, far exceeded that of any of his
                    predeceſſors. He could command the purſes of his clergy; he had large films of
                    ready money in his exchequer; his forts were well ſtored and fortified; and he
                    was now daily receiving remittances of money, arms, and ammunition from France.
                    All this ſhow of happineſs was only in appearance; for the affections of his
                    nobility, and the wiſer part of his ſubjects, were now alienated from him more
                    than ever, by the exceſſive attachment he ſhowed to bigotry and persecution.</p>
                <p>He had nominated the earl of Huntley to command his army on the borders,
                    conſiſting of 10,000 men; and his lieutenant-general was Sir Walter Lindſay of
                    Torphichen, who had ſeen a great deal of foreign ſervice, and was eſteemed an
                    excellent officer. Huntley acquitted himſelf admirably well in his commiſſion;
                    and was ſo well ſerved by his ſpies, as to have certain intelligence that the
                    Engliſh intended to ſurpriſe and burn Jedburgh and Kelſo. The Engliſh army under
                    Sir Robert Bowes and the Douglaſſes, with other northern Engliſhmen, continued
                    ſtill upon the borders; and one of the reſolutions the Scotch nobility and
                    gentry had come to, was, not to attack them on their own ground, nor to act
                    offenſively, unleſs their enemies invaded Scotland. Huntly being informed that
                    the Engliſh had advanced, on the 24th of Auguſt, to a place called <hi
                        rend="italic">Haldanrig,</hi> and that they had deſtroyed great part of the
                    Scotch and debateable lands, reſolved to engage them: and the Engliſh were
                    aſtoniſhed, when at day-break they ſaw the Scotch army drawn up in order of
                    battle. Neither party could now retreat without fighting; and Torphichen, who
                    led the van, conſiſting of 2000 of the beſt troops of Scotland, charged the
                    Engliſh ſo furiouſly, that Huntley gained a complete and an eaſy victory. Above
                    200 of the Engliſh were killed, and 600 taken priſoners; among whom were their
                    general Sir Robert Bowes, Sir William Mowbray, and about 60 of the moſt
                    diſtinguiſhed northern barons; the earl of Angus eſcaping by the ſwiftneſs of
                    his horſe. The loſs of the Scots was inconſiderable.</p>
                <p>In the meanwhile, the duke, of Norfolk having rai-<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0025.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0019"/> ſed a great
                    army, had orders to march northwards, and to diſperſe a maniſefto, complaining
                    of James for having diſappointed him of the interview at York, and reviving the
                    ridiculous claim of his own and his anceſtors ſuperiority over the kingdom of
                    Scotland. It was plain, from the words of this manifeſto, that Henry was ſtill
                    placable towards James; and that he would eaſily have dropt that claim, if his
                    nephew would have made any perſonal advances towards a reconciliation.</p>
                <p>The condition of James was now deplorable. The few faithful counſellors he had
                    about him, ſuch as Kirkaldy of Grange, who was then lord treaſurer, plainly
                    intimated, that he could have no dependence upon his nobles, as he was devoted
                    to the clergy; and James, ſometimes, in a fit of diſtraction, would draw his
                    dagger upon the cardinal and other eccleſiaſtics when they came to him with
                    freſh propoſitions of murder and proſcriptions, and drive them out of his
                    preſence. But he had no conſtancy of mind; and he certainly put into his pocket
                    a bloody ſcroll that had been brought him by his prieſts, beginning with the
                    earl of Arran, the firſt fubject of the kingdom. In one of his cooler moments,
                    he appointed the lord Erſkine, and ſome others of his nobility, to make a freſh
                    attempt to gain time; and Henry even condeſcended to order the duke of Norfolk
                    (who was then advanced as far as York), the lord privy ſeal, the biſhop of
                    Durham, and others, to treat with him. The conferences were ſhort and
                    unſucceſsſul. The duke bitterly complained, that the Scots ſought only to amuſe
                    him till the ſeaſon for action was over. In ſhort, he conſidered both them and
                    Learmouth, who was ordered to attend him, as ſo many ſpies, and treated them
                    accordingly. It was the 21ſt of October before he entered the eaſt borders of
                    Scotland. According to the Scotch hiſtorians, his army conſiſted of 40,000 men;
                    but the Engliſh have fixed it at 20,000.</p>
                <p>James affected to complain oſ this invaſion as being unprovoked; but he loſt no
                    time in preparing to repel the danger. The ſituation of his nobility, who were
                    preſſed by a foreign invaſion on the one hand, and domeſtic tyrants on the
                    other, induced them to hold frequent conſultations; and in one of them, they
                    reſolved to renew the ſcene that had been acted at Lawder bridge under James
                    III. by hanging all his grandſon’s evil counſellors. The Scots hiſtorians ſay,
                    that this reſolution was not executed, becauſe the nobility could not agree
                    about the victims that were, to be ſacrificed; and that the king, who was
                    encamped with his army at Fallamoor, having intelligence of their conſultation,
                    removed haſtily to Edinburgh; from which he ſent orders for his army to advance,
                    and give battle to the duke of Norfolk, who appears as yet not to have entered
                    the Scotch borders. The anſwer of the nobility was, that they were determined
                    not to attack the duke upon Engliſh ground; but that if he invaded Scotland,
                    they knew their duty. The earl of Huntley, who commanded the van of the Scottiſh
                    army, conſiſting of 10,000 men, was of the ſame opinion: but no ſooner did
                    Norfolk paſs the Tweed, than he haraſſed the Engliſh army, cut off their
                    foraging parties, and diſtreſſed them in ſuch a manner, that the duke agreed
                    once more to a conference for peace; which was managed, on the part of the
                    Scots, by the biſhop of Orkney and Sir James Learmouth; but nothing was con</p>
                <p>cluded. The Engliſh general, finding it now impoſſible on many accounts to
                    proſecute his invaſion, repaſſed the Tweed; and was haraſſed in his march by the
                    earl of Huntley, who deſiſted from the purſuit the moment his enemies gained
                    Engliſh ground.</p>
                <p>James, whoſe army at this time amounted to above 30,000 men, continued ſtill at
                    Edinburgh, from which he ſent frequent meſſages to order his nobility and
                    generals to follow the duke of Norfolk into England; but theſe were diſregarded.
                    James was flattered, that now he had it in his power to be revenged for all the
                    indignities that had been offered by England to Scotland. In this he was
                    encouraged by the French ambaſſador, and the high opinion he had of his own
                    troops. About the beginning of November, he came to a reſolution of reaſſembling
                    his army, which was disbanded upon the duke of Norfolk’s retreat. This project
                    appeared ſo feaſible and ſo promiſing, that ſeveral of the nobility are ſaid to
                    have fallen in with it, particularly the lord Maxwell, the earls of Arran,
                    Caſſils, and Glencairn, with the lords Fleming, Somerville, and Erſkine: others
                    repreſented, but in vain, that the arms of Scotland had already gained
                    ſufficient honour, by obliging the powerful army of the Engliſh, with their moſt
                    experienced general at their head, to make a ſhameful retreat before a handful;
                    that the force of Scotland was inferior to that of England; and that an
                    honourable peace was ſtill practicable. It was ſaid, in reply to thoſe
                    conſiderations, that the ſtate of the quarrel was now greatly altered; that
                    Henry had in his manifeſto declared his intention to enſlave their country; that
                    he treated the nobility as his vaſſals; that the duke of Norfolk had been guilty
                    of burning the dwellings of the deſenceleſs inhabitants, by laying above 20
                    villages and towns in aſhes; and that no Scotchman, who was not corrupted by
                    Henry’s gold, would oppoſe the king’s will. The laſt, perhaps, was the chief
                    argument that prevailed on the lord Maxwell, a nobleman of great honour and
                    courage, to agree to carry the war into England by Solway, provided he was at
                    the head of 10,000 men. It was at laſt agreed that the earl of Arran and the
                    cardinal ſhould openly raiſe men, as if they intended to enter the eaſt marches,
                    where they were to make only a feint, while the lord Maxwell was to make the
                    real attempt upon the weſt. Private letters were everywhere circulated to raiſe
                    the men who were to ſerve under the lord Maxwell; among whom were the earls of
                    Caſſils and Glencairn, the lords Fleming, Somerville, Erſkine, and many other
                    persons of great conſideration. James, who never was ſuſpected of want of
                    courage, probably would have put himſelf at the head of this expedition, had he
                    not been diſſuaded from it by his prieſts and minions, who reminded him of the
                    conſultations at Fallamoor, and the other treaſonable practices of the nobility.
                    They added, that moſt of them being corrupted by the Engliſh gold, he could not
                    be too much on his guard. He was at laſt perſuaded to repair to the caſtle of
                    Lochmaben or Carlaverock, and there to wait the iſſue of the inroad.</p>
                <p>It was probably at this place that James was prevailed on to come to the fatal
                    reſolution of appointing one Oliver Sinclair, a ſon of the houſe of Roſlin, and
                    a favourite minion at court, to command the army in chief; and his commiſſion
                    was made out accordingly.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0026.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0020"/> On the 23d of November, the Scots began their
                    march at midnight; and having paſſed the Eſk, all the adjacent villages were
                    ſeen in flames by the break of day. Sir Thomas Wharton, the Engliſh warden of
                    thole marches, the baſtard Dacres, and Muſgrave, haſtily raiſed a few troops,
                    the whole not exceeding 500 men, and drew them up upon an advantageous ground;
                    when Sinclair, ordering the royal banner to be diſplayed, and being mounted on
                    the ſhouldcrs of two tall men, produced and read his commiſſion. It is
                    impoſſible to imagine the conſternation into which the Scots were thrown upon
                    this occaſion; and their leaders ſetting the example, the whole army declared
                    (according to the Scotch authors), that they would rather ſurrender themſelves
                    priſoners to the Engliſh, than ſubmit to be commanded by ſuch a general. In an
                    inſtant, all order in the Scotch army was broken down; horſe and foot, ſoldiers
                    and ſeullions, noblemen and peaſants, were intermingled. It was eaſy for the
                    Engliſh general to perceive this confuſion, and perhaps to gueſs at its cauſe, A
                    hundred of his light-horſe happened to advance; they met no reſiſtance: the
                    nobles were the firſt who lurrendered themſelves priſoners; and the reſt of the
                    Engliſh advancing, they obtained a bloodleſs victory; for even the women and the
                    boys made priſoners of Scotch ſoldiers, and few or none were killed. The lord
                    Herbert relates the circumſtances of this ſhameful affair with ſome immaterial
                    differences; but agrees with the Scotch authorities upon the whole. He mentions,
                    however, no more than 800 common ſoldiers having been made priſoners. The chief
                    of the priſoners were the earls of Caſſils and Glencairn, the lords Maxwell,
                    Fleming, Somerville, Oliphant, and Gray, with above 200 gentlemen beſides.</p>
                <p>James was then at Carlaverock, which is about 12 miles diſtant from the place of
                    action, depreed in his ſpirſts, and anxious about the event of the expedition,
                    which is to this day called the <hi rend="italic">Raid of Solway moss.</hi> When
                    the news came to his ears, and that the earl of Arran and the cardinal were
                    returned to Edinburgh, he was ſeized with an additional dejection of mind, which
                    brought him to his grave. In ſuch a ſituation every cruel action of his former
                    life wounded his conſcience; and he at laſt ſunk into a ſullen melancholy, which
                    admitted of no conſolation. From Carlaverock he removed to Falkland; and was
                    ſometimes heard to expreſs himſelſ as if he thought that the whole body of his
                    nobility were in a conſpiracy againſt his perſon and dignity. The preſence of
                    the few attendants who were admitted into his chamber, and who were the wicked
                    inſtrumcnts of his miſconduct, ſeemed to aggravate his ſufferings, and he either
                    could not or would not take any ſuſtenance. His death being now inevitable,
                    Beaton approached his bed-ſide with a paper, to which he is ſaid to have
                    directed the king’s hand, pretending that it was his laſt will. On the 18th of
                    December, while James was in this deplorable ſtate, a meſſenger came from
                    Linlithgow, with an account that the queen was brought to bed of a daughter; and
                    the laſt words he was diſtinctly heard to ſay, were, “ It will end as it began:
                    the crown came by a woman, and it will go with one; many miſeries approach this
                    poor kingdom; king Henry will either maſter it by arms, or win it by marriage.”
                    He then turned his face to the wall, and in broken ejaculations pronounced the
                    word <hi rend="italic">Solway moss,</hi> and ſome faint expreſſions alluding to
                    the diſgrace he ſuſſered, In this ſtate he languiſhed for ſome days; for it is
                    certain he did not ſurvive the 13th.</p>
                <p>James V. was ſucceeded by his infant daughter Mary, whoſe birth we have already
                    mentioned. James had taken no ſteps for the ſecurity of his kingdom, ſo that
                    ambitious men had now another opportunity of throwing the public affairs into
                    confulion. The ſituation of Scotland indeed at this time was very critical. Many
                    of the nobility were priſoners in England, and thoſe who remained at home were
                    factious and turbulent. The nation was diſpirited by an unſucceſsful war.
                    Commotions were daily excited on account of religion, and Henry VIII. had formed
                    a deſign of adding Scotland to his other dominions. By a teſtamentary deed which
                    cardinal Beaton had forged in the name of his ſovereign, he was appointed tutor
                    to the queen and governor of the realm, and three of the principal nobility were
                    named to act as his counſellors in the adminiſtration. The nobility and the
                    people, however, calling in queſtion the authenticity of this deed, which he
                    could not eſtabliſh, the cardinal was degraded from the dignity he had aſſumed;
                    and the eſtates of the kingdom advanced into the regency James Hamilton, earl of
                    Arran, whom they judged to be entitled to this diſtinction, as the ſecond perſon
                    of the kingdom, and the neareſt heir, after Mary, to the crown.</p>
                <p>The diſgrace of cardinal Beaton might have proved the deſtruction of his party,
                    if the earl of Arran had been endowed with vigour of mind and ability. But his
                    views were circumſcribed; and he did not compenſate for this defect by any
                    firmneſs of purpoſe. He was too indolent to gain partizans, and too irreſolute
                    to fix them. Slight difficulties filled him with embarraſſment, and great ones
                    overpowered him. His enemies, applying themſelves to the timidity of his
                    dispoſition, betrayed him into weakneſſes; and the eſteem which his gentlenefs
                    had procured him in private life, was loſt in the contempt attending his public
                    conduct, which was feeble, fluctuating, and inconſiſtent.</p>
                <p>The attachment which the regent was known to profeſs for the reformed religion,
                    drew to him the love of the people; his high birth, and the mildneſs of Iris
                    virtues, conciliated their reſpect; and from the circumſtance, that his name was
                    at the head of the roll of heretics which the clergy had preſented to the late
                    king, a ſentiment of tenderneſs was mingled with his popularity. His conduct
                    correſponded, at firſt, with the impreſſions entertained in his favour. Thomas
                    Guillame and John Rough, two celebrated preachers, were invited to live in his
                    houſe; and he permitted them to declaim openly againſt the errors of the church
                    of Rome. They attacked and expoſed the ſupremacy of the pope, the worſhip of
                    images, and the invocation of ſaints. Cardinal Beaton and the prelates were
                    exceedingly provoked, and indefatigably active to defend the eltabliſhed
                    doctrines.</p>
                <p>This public ſanction afforded to the reformation was of little conſequence,
                    however, when compared with a meaſure which was ſoon after adopted by Robert
                    lord Maxwell. He propoſed, that the liberty of reading the ſcriptures in the
                    vulgar tongue ſhould be permitted to the people; and that, for the future, no
                    heretical guilt<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0027.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0021"
                    /> ſhould be inſerred againſt any perſon ſor having them in his poſſeſſion, or
                    for making uſe of them. The regent and the three eſtates acknowleged the
                    propriety of this propoſal. Gavin Dunbar archbiſhop of Glaſgow, and chancellor
                    of Scotland, proteſted, indeed, for himſelf and for the church, that no act on
                    this ſubject ſhould paſs and be effectual, till a provincial council of all the
                    clergy of the kingdom ſhould conſider and determine, whether there was a
                    neceſſity that the people ſhould conſult and ſtudy the ſcriptures in the vulgar
                    tongue. But his prateſtation being disregarded, the bill of the lord Maxwell was
                    carried into a law, and the regent made it generally known by a
                    proclamation.</p>
                <p>From this period copies of the Bible were imported in great numbers from England;
                    and men, allured by an appeal ſo flattering to their reaſon, were proud to
                    recover from the ſupine ignorance in which they had been kept by an artful
                    prieſthocd. To read became a common accompliſhment: and books were multiplied in
                    every quarter, which diſcloſed the pride, the tyranny, and the abſurdities of
                    the Romiſh church and iuperſtitions.</p>
                <p>The death of James V. proved very favourable to the ambitious deſigns of Henry.
                    He now propoſed an union of the two kingdoms by the marriage of his ſon Edward
                    VI. with Mary the young queen of Scotland. To promote this, he releaſed the
                    noblemen who had been taken priſoners at Solway, after having engaged them on
                    oath, not only to concur in promoting the alliance, but to endeavour to procure
                    him the charge and cuſtody of the young queen, with the government of her
                    kingdom, and the poſſeſſion of her caſtles. The earl of Angus and his brother,
                    who had been fifteen years in exile, accompanied them to Scotland, and brought
                    letters from Henry recommending them to the reſtitution of their honours and
                    eſtates. The regent was inclined to favour the demands of perſons of ſuch
                    eminent ſtation; but though the ſtates were inclined to the marriage, they
                    refuſed to permit the removal of the queen into England, and treated with
                    contempt the idea of giving the government of Scotland and the care of the
                    caſtles to the king of England. Sir Ralph Sadler, the Engliſh ambaſtador,
                    exerted all his endeavours to induce the regent to comply with the requiſitions
                    of his maſter; but all his intrigues were unſucceſsful; and Henry perceiving
                    that he muſt depart from ſuch extravagant conditions, at laſt authoriſed the
                    commiſſioners to conſent to treaties of amity and marriage, on the moſt
                    favourable terms that could be procured. In conſequence of theſe powers given to
                    the eommiſſioners, it was agreed that a firm peace and alliance ſhould take
                    place between the two nations, and that they ſhould mutually defend and protect
                    one another in caſe of an invaſion. The queen was to remain within her own
                    dominions till ſhe was ten years of age; and Henry was not to claim any ſhare in
                    the government. Six nobles, or their apparent heirs, were to be ſurrendered to
                    him in ſecurity for the conveyance of the young queen into England, and for her
                    marriage with prince Edward, as ſoon as ſhe was ten years of age. It was alſo
                    ſtipulated, that though the queen ſhould have iſſue by Edward, Scotland ſhould
                    retain not only its name, but its laws and liberties.</p>
                <p>Theſe conditions, however advantageous to Scotland, yet did not give entire
                    ſatisfaction Cardinal</p>
                <p>Beaton, who had been impriſoned on pretence of treaſonable ſchemes, and was now
                    releaſed from his confine, ment by the influence of the queen-dowager, took all
                    opportunities of exclaiming againſt the alliance, as tending to deſtroy the
                    independency of the kingdom. He pointed out to the churchmen the dangers which
                    aroſe from the prevalence of hereſy, and urged them to unanimity and zeal.
                    Awakening all their fears and ſelfiſhneſs, they granted him a large ſum of money
                    with which he might gain partizans; the friars were instructed to preach againſt
                    the treaties with England; and fanatical men were inſtructed to diſplay their
                    rage in offering indignities to Sir Ralph Sadler.</p>
                <p>Cardinal Beaton was not the only antagoniſt the regent had to deal with. The
                    Earls of Argyle, Hunt- ley, Bothwel, and Murray, concurred in the oppoſition;
                    and having collected ſome troops, and poſſeſſed themſelves of the queen’s
                    perſon, they affirmed all the authority. They were joined by the earl of Lenox,
                    who was made to hope that he might eſpouſe the queen- dowager and obtain the
                    regency. He was also inclined to oppoſe the earl oſ Arran, from an ancient
                    quarrel which had ſubſiſted between their two families; and from a claim he had
                    to ſuperſede him, not only in the enjoyment of his perſonal eſtates, but in the
                    ſucceſſion to the crown. The regent, alarmed at ſuch a powerful combination
                    againſt him, inclined to attend to ſome advances which were made him by the
                    queen- dowager and cardinal. To refuſe to confirm the treaties, after he had
                    brought them to a concluſion, was, however, a ſtep ſo repugnant to probity, that
                    he could not be prevailed upon to adopt it. He therefore, in a ſolemn manner,
                    ratified them in the abbey-church of Holyroodhouſe, and commanded the great ſeal
                    of Scotland to be appended to them. The fame day he went to St Andrew’s, and
                    iſſued a mandate to the cardinal, requiring him to return to his allegiance. To
                    this the prelate refuſed to pay any attention, or to move ſrom his caſtle; upon
                    which the regent denounced him a rebel, and threatened to compel him to
                    ſubmiſſion by military force. But in a few days after, the puſillammous regent
                    meeting with Beaton, forſook the intereſt of Henry VIII. and embraced that of
                    the queen-dowager and of France. Being in haſte alſo to reconcile himſelf to the
                    church of Rome, he renounced publicly, at Stirling, the opinions of the
                    reformed, and received abſolution from the hands of the cardinal.</p>
                <p>By this mean-ſpirited conduct the regent expoſed himſelf to univerſal contempt,
                    while cardinal Beaton usurped the wſhole authority. The earl of Lenox, finding
                    that he had no hopes of ſucceſs in his ſuit to the queen dowager, engaged in
                    negociations with Henry, to place himſelf at the head of the Scottiſh lords who
                    were in the Engliſh intereſt, and to aſſert the cauſe of the reformation. The
                    conſequence of all this was a rupture with England. Henry not only delayed to
                    ratify the treaties on his part, but ordered all the Scottiſh ſhips in the
                    harbours oſ England to be taken and confiſcated. This violent proceeding
                    inflamed the national diſguſts againſt the Engliſh alliance; and the party of
                    the cardinal and queen-dowager thus obtained an increaſe of popularity. Henry
                    himſelf, however, was ſo much accuſtomed to acts of outrage and violence, that
                    he ſeemed to think the ſtep he had juſt now takena matter of no moment; and
                    therefore he de-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0028.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0022"
                    /> manded that the hoſtages, in terms of the treaty of marriage, ſhould still be
                    delivered up to him. But the cardinal and regent informed his ambaſſador, Sir
                    Ralph Sadler, that from their own authority they could not command any of the
                    nobles to be committted to him as hoſtages; and that the offenſive ſtrain of
                    behaviour aſſumed by the Engliſh monarch might have altered the ſentiments of
                    the Scottiſh parliament with regard to a meaſure of ſuch importance. After much
                    altercation, the conferences were broken off; and as the lords who were releaſed
                    from captivity had promiſed to return priſoners to England, it now remained with
                    them to fulfil their promiſe. None of them, however, had the courage to do ſo,
                    excepting the earl of Caſſils; and Henry, being ſtruck with his punctilious
                    ſenſe of honour, diſmiſſed him loaded with preſents.</p>
                <p>Cardinal Beaton being thus in poſſeſſion of power, took meaſures to ſecure it.
                    The ſolemnity of the coronation of the young queen was celebrated at Stirling. A
                    council was choſen to direct and aſſiſt the regent in the greater affairs of
                    ſtate, at the head of which was the queen-dowager. John Hamilton, the abbot of
                    Paiſley, who had acquired an aſcendency over the regent, was alſo promoted to
                    the privy ſeal, and made treaſurer of the kingdom; and cardinal Beaton, upon the
                    requeſt of the regent and the three eſtates, accepted the office of lord high
                    chancellor.</p>
                <p>After the flatteries and the hopes with which the earl of Lenox had been amuſed,
                    the cardinal had reaſon to dread the utmoſt warmth of his reſentment. He had
                    therefore written to Francis I. giving a detail oſ the critical ſituation of
                    affairs in Scotland, and intreating him to recal to France the earl of Lenox,
                    who was now intereſted to oppoſe the influence and operations of the
                    queen-dowager. But the indignation with which the treachery of the cardinal had
                    inflamed the earl of Lenox, precipitated him into immediate action, and defeated
                    the intention of this artifice. In the hoſtile ſituation of his mind towards
                    Scotland, an opportunity of commencing hoſtilitſes had preſented itſelf. Five
                    ſhips had arrived in the Clyde from France, loaded with warlike flores, and
                    having on board the patriarch of Venice, Peter Contareni, legate from Paul III.
                    with La Broſſe, and James Meſnaige, ambaſſadors from France; and 30,000 crowns,
                    which were to be employed in ſtrengthening the French faction, and to be
                    diſtributed by the queen-dowager and the cardinal. Prevailing with the
                    commanders of theſe veſſels, who conceived him to be the faſt friend of their
                    monarch, he ſecured this money for his own uſe, and depoſited the military
                    ſtores in his caſtle of Dumbarton, under the care of George Stirling the
                    deputy-governor, who at this time was entirely in his intereſts.</p>
                <p>By the ſuccessful application of this wealth, the earl of Lenox called forth the
                    full exertion of his party in levying a formidable army, with which he
                    threatened the deſtruction of the regent and the cardinal, offering them battle
                    in the fields between Leith and Edinburgh. The regent, not being in a condition
                    to accept the challenge of his rival, had recourſe to negociation. Cardinal
                    Beaton and the earl of Huntley propoſed terms of amity, and exerted themſelves
                    with ſo much addreſs, that the earl of Lenox, loſing the opportunity of
                    chastiſing his enemies, conſented to an accommodation, and indulged anew the
                    hope of obtaining the queen-</p>
                <p>dowager in marriage. His army was dismissed, and he threw himſelf at the feet of
                    his miſtreſs, by whom he was, in appearance, favourably received: but many of
                    his friends were ſeduced from him under different pretences; and at laſt,
                    apprehending his total ruin from ſome ſecret enterpriſe, he fled to Glaſgow, and
                    fortified himſelf in that city. The regent, collecting an army, marched againſt
                    him; and having defeated his friend the earl of Glencairn in a bloody encounter,
                    was able to reduce the place of ſtrength in which he confided. In this ebb of
                    his fortune, the earl of Lenox had no hope but from England.</p>
                <p>The revolution produced in the political ſtate of Scotland by the arts of
                    cardinal Beaton, while it defeated the intrigues of Henry VIII. pointed all its
                    ſtrength againſt the progreſs of the reformation. After abandoning his old
                    friends, the regent, in connection with the cardinal, was ambitious to undo all
                    the ſervices he had rendered to them. The three eſtates annulled the treaties of
                    amity and marriage, and empowered commiſſioners to conclude an alliance with
                    France. The regent diſcharged the two preachers Guillame and Rough, whom he had
                    invited to impugn the doctrines of the church. He drove back into England many
                    pious perſons, whoſe zeal had brought them to Scotland, to explain and advance
                    the new opinions. He careſſed with particular reſpect the legate whom the pope
                    had ſent to diſcourage the marriage of the young queen with the prince of Wales,
                    and to promiſe his aſſiſtance againſt the enterpriſes of Henry VIII. He procured
                    an act of parliament to be paſſed for the persecution of heretics; and, upon the
                    foundation of this authority, the moſt rigorous proceedings were concerted
                    againſt the reformed; when the arms of England, rouſing the apprehenſions of the
                    nation, gave the fulleſt employment to the regent and his counſellors.</p>
                <p>In the rage and anguiſh of diſappointed ambition, the earl of Lenox made an offer
                    to aſſiſt the views of the king of England; who, treating him as an ally,
                    engaged, in the event of ſucceſs, to give him in marriage his niece the lady
                    Margaret Douglas, and to inveſt him in the regency of Scotland. To eſtabliſh the
                    reformation in Scotland, to acquire the ſuperiority over it to Henry VIII. and
                    to effectuate the marriage of the prince of Wales with the queen of Scots, were
                    the great objects of their confederacy.</p>
                <p>Henry, though engaged in a war with France, which required all his military
                    force, could not reſiſt the earlieſt opportunity in his power to execute his
                    vengeance againſt Scotland. Edward Symour earl of Hartford was appointed to
                    command 10,000 men; who were embarked at Tinmouth, aboard a fleet of 200 ſhips,
                    under the direction of Sir John Dudley lord Liſle. This army was landed without
                    oppoſition near Leith; and the earl of Hartford made it known to Sir Adam
                    Otterburn, the provoſt of Edinburgh, that his commiſſion empowered him to lay
                    the country waſte and deſolate, unleſs the regent ſhould deliver up the young
                    queen to the king of England. It was anſwered, that every extremity oſ diſtreſs
                    would be endured, before the Scottiſh nation would ſubmit to ſo ignominious a
                    demand. Six thouſand horſe from Berwick, under the lord Evers, now joined the
                    earl oſ Hartford. Leith and Edinburgh, aſter a feeble reſiſtance, yielded to the
                    Engliſh commander; who abandoned them to pillage,<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0029.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0023"/> and then ſet
                    fire to them. A cruel devaſtation enſued in the ſurrounding villages and
                    country, and an immenſe booty was conveyed on board the Engliſh fleet. But,
                    while an extreme terror was everywhere excited, the earl of Hartford re-imbarked
                    a part of his troops, and ordered the remainder to march with expedition to the
                    frontiers of England.</p>
                <p>The regent, aſſiſted by cardinal Beaton and the earls of Huntley, Argyle,
                    Bothwell, and Murray, was active, in the mean time, to collect an army, and to
                    provide for the ſecurity of the kingdom. He felt, therefore, the greateſt
                    ſurpriſe on being relieved ſo unexpectedly from the moſt imminent danger; and an
                    expedition, conducted with ſo little diſcernment, did not advance the meaſures
                    of Henry VIII. To accompliſh the marriage of the young queen with the prince of
                    Wales, to poſſeſs himſelf of her perſon, or to achieve a conqueſt over Scotland,
                    were all circumſtances apparently within the reach of the Engliſh commander: and
                    yet, in the moment of victory, he neglected to proſecute his advantages; and
                    having inflamed the animoſities of the Scottiſh nation, by a diſplay of the
                    paſſions and cruelty of his maſter, left them to recover from their diſaſter,
                    and to improve in their reſources.</p>
                <p>The earl of Lenox, taking the opportunity of the Engliſh fleet, went to conſult
                    with Henry VIII. upon the deſperate ſtate of his affairs. He renewed his
                    engagements with this monarch; and received in marriage the lady Margaret
                    Douglas, with poſſeſſions in England Soon after, he arrived in the frith of
                    Clyde, with 18 ſhips and 600 ſoldiers, that he might ſecure the caſtle of
                    Dumbarton, and employ himſelf in plundering and devaſtation. But George
                    Stirling, to whom the caſtle was intruſted, refuſed to ſurrender it; and even
                    obliged him to reimbark his troops. After engaging in a few petty incurſions and
                    ſkirmiſhes, he returned to England.</p>
                <p>In 1544, Henry conſented to a truce; and Scotland, after having ſuffered the
                    miſeries of war, was subjected to the horrors of perſecution. The regent had
                    procured an act of parliament for the perſecution of the reformed; and the
                    cardinal, to draw to himſelf an additional ſplendour and power, had obtained
                    from the pope the dignity of legate <hi rend="italic">à latere.</hi> A
                    viſitation of his own dioceſe appeared to him the moſt proper method of
                    commencing the propoſed extirpation of hereſy; and he carried with him in his
                    train the regent, and many perſons of diſtinction, to aſſiſt in his
                    judicatories, and to ſhare in his diſgrace.</p>
                <p>In the town of Perth a great many perſons were accuſed and condemned. The moſt
                    trifling offences were regarded as atrocious crimes, and made the ſubjects of
                    proſecution and puniſhment. Robert Lamb was hanged for affirming that the
                    invocation of faints had no merit to fave. William Anderſon, James Reynold, and
                    James Finlayſon, ſuffered the fame death, for having abuſed an image of St
                    Francis, by putting horns upon his head. James Hunter, having kept their
                    company, was found to be equally guilty, and puniſhed in the fame manner. Helen
                    Stirke, having refuſed, when in labour, to invoke the aſſiſtance of the Virgin,
                    was drowned in a pool of water. Many of the burgesses of Perth, being ſuſpected
                    of hereſy, were ſent into baniſhment; and the lord Ruthven, the provoſt, was
                    upon the ſame account diſmiſſed from his office.</p>
                <p>The cardinal was ſtrenuous in perſecuting hereſy in other parts of his dioceſe.
                    But the diſcontents and clamour attending the executions of men of inferior
                    ſtation were now loſt in the fame of the martyrdom of George Wiſhart; a perſon
                    who, while he was reſpectable by his birth, was highly eminent from the opinion
                    entertained of his capacity and endowments. The hiſtorians of the Proteſtant
                    perſuaſion have ſpoken of this reformer in terms of the higheſt admiration. They
                    extol his learning as extenſive, inſiſt on the extreme candour of his
                    diſpoſition, and aſcribe to him the utmost purity of morals. But while the
                    ſtrain of their panegyric is expoſed to ſuſpicion from its exceſs, they have
                    ventured to impute to him the ſpirit of prophecy; ſo that we must neceſſarily
                    receive their eulogiums with ſome abatement. It may be ſufficient to affirm,
                    that Mr Wiſhart was the moſt eminent preacher who had hitherto appeared in
                    Scotland. His mind was certainly cultivated by reflection and ſtudy, and he was
                    amply poſſeſſed of thoſe abilities and qualifications which awaken and agitate
                    the paſſions of the people. His miniſtry had been attended with the moſt
                    flattering ſucceſs; and his courage to encounter danger grew with his
                    reputation. The day before he was apprehended, he ſaid to John Knox, who
                    attended him; “I amt weary of the world, since I perceive that men are weary of
                    God.” He had already reconciled himſelf to that terrible death which awaited
                    him. He was found in the houſe of Cockburn of Ormiſton, in Eaſt Lothian; who
                    refuſing to deliver him to the ſervants of the regent, the earl of Bothwell, the
                    ſheriff of the county, required that he ſhould be intruſted to his care, and
                    promiſed that no injury ſhould be done to him But the authority of the regent
                    and his counſellors obliged the earl to ſurrender his charge. He was conveyed to
                    the cardinal’s caſtle at St Andrew’s, and his trial was hurried on with
                    precipitation. The cardinal and the clergy proceeding in it without the
                    concurrence of the ſecular power, adjudged him to be burnt alive. In the
                    circumſtances of his execution there appears a deliberate and moſt barbarous
                    cruelty. When led out to the ſtake, he was met by prieſts, who, mocking his
                    condition, called upon him to pray to the virgin, that ſhe might intercede with
                    her Son for mercy to him. “Forbear to tempt me, my brethern,” was his mild reply
                    to them. A black coat of linen was put upon him by one executioner, and bags of
                    powder were faſtened to his body by another. Some pieces of ordnance were
                    pointed to the place of execution. He ſpoke to the ſpectators, intreating them
                    to remember that he was to die for the true goſpel of Chriſt. Fire was
                    communicated to the faggots. From a balcony in a tower of his caſtle, which was
                    hung with tapeſtry, the cardinal and the prelates, reclining upon rich cuſhions,
                    beheld the inhuman ſcene. This inſolent triumph, more than all his afflictions,
                    affected the magnanimity of the ſufferer. He exclaimed, that the enemy, who ſo
                    proudly ſolaced himſelf, would periſh in a few days, and be expoſed
                    ignominiouſly in the place which he now occupied.</p>
                <p>Cardinal Beaton took a pleaſure in receiving the congratulations of the clergy
                    upon a deed, which, it was thought, would fill the enemies of the church with
                    terror. But the indignation of the people was more excited than their fears. All
                    ranks of men were dis-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0030.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0024"/> guſted with an exercise of power which deſpiſed
                    every boundary of moderation and juſtice. The prediction of Mr Wiſhart,
                    ſuggeſted by the general odium which attended the cardinal, was conſidered by
                    the disciples of this martyr as the effuſion of a prophet; and perhaps gave
                    occaſion to the aſſaſſination that followed, Their complaints were attended to
                    by Norman Leſly, the eldeſt ſon of the earl of Rothes, whom the cardinal had
                    treated with indignity, though he had profited by his ſervices. He conſented to
                    be their leader. The cardinal was in his caſtle at St Andrew’s, which he was
                    fortifying after the ſtrongeſt faſhion of that age. The conſpirators, at
                    different times, early in the morning, entered into it. The gates were ſecured;
                    and appointing a guard, that no intimation of their proceedings might go to the
                    cardinal, they diſmiſſed from the caſtle all his workmen ſeparately, to the
                    number of 100, and all his domeſtics, who amounted to no fewer than 50 perſons.
                    The eldeſt ſon of the earl of Arran, whom he kept as an hoſtage for his father’s
                    behaviour, was alone detained by them. The prelate, alarmed with their noiſe,
                    looked from his window, and was informed that his caſtle was taken by Norman
                    Lesly. It was in vain that he endeavoured to ſecure the door of his chamber by
                    bolts and cheſts. The conſpirators brought fire, and were ready to apply it,
                    when, admitting them into his preſence, he implored their mercy. Two of them
                    ſtruck him haſtily with their ſwords. But James Melvil, rebuking their paſſion,
                    told them, that this work and judgment of God, though ſecret, ought to be done
                    with gravity. He reminded the cardinal, in general terms, of the enormity of his
                    ſins, and reproached him in a more particular manner with the death of Mr
                    Wiſhart. He ſwore, that no hopes of his riches, no dread of his power, and no
                    hatred to his perſon, were any motives which actuated him; but that he was moved
                    to accompliſh his deſtruction, by the obſtinacy and zeal maniſeſted by him
                    againſt Chriſt Jeſus and his holy goſpel. Waiting for no anſwer to his harangue,
                    he thruſt the cardinal three times through the body with his dagger, on the 29th
                    of May 1546,</p>
                <p>The rumour that the caſtle was taken giving an alarm to the inhabitants of St
                    Andrew’s, they came in crowds to gratify their curioſity, and to offer their
                    aſſiſtance, according to the ſentiments they entertained. The adherents and
                    dependents of the cardinal were clamorous to ſee him; and the conſpirators,
                    carrying his dead body to the very place from which he had beheld the ſuſſerings
                    of Mr Wiſhart, expoſed it to their view.</p>
                <p>The truce, in the mean time, which had been concluded with England was frequently
                    interrupted; but no memorable battles were fought. Mutual depredations kept
                    alive the hoſtile ſpirit of the two kingdoms; and while the regent was making
                    military preparations, which gave the promiſe of important events, a treaty of
                    peace was finiſhed between England and France, in which Francis I. took care to
                    comprehend the Scottiſh nation. In this treaty it was ſtipulated by Henry, that
                    he was not to wage war againſt Scotland, unleſs he ſhould be provoked by new and
                    juſt cauſes of hoſtility.</p>
                <p>But the murderers of cardinal Beaton, apprehenſive of their ſafety, had
                    diſpatched meſſengers into England, with applications to Henry for assiſtance;
                    and being mined by more than 120 of their friends, they took the reſolution oſ
                    keeping the caſtle, and of defending</p>
                <p>themſelves. Henry, notwithstanding his treaty with France, reſolved to embrace
                    this opportunity of augmenting the diſturbances of Scotland. He haſtened to
                    collect troops; and the regent and his counſellors preſſed France for ſupplies
                    in men and money, and military ſtores and artillery.</p>
                <p>The high places which the cardinal occupied were filled up immediately upon his
                    death. John Hamilton abbot of Paiſley was elected archbiſhop of St Andrew’s, and
                    George earl of Huntley was promoted to be chancellor. By theſe officers the
                    regent was urged to proceed with vigour againſt the conſpirators; and it was a
                    matter of the greatcſt anxiety to him to recover his eldeſt ſon, whom they
                    detained in cuſtody, The clergy had, in the moſt ſolernn manner, pronounced them
                    to be accurſed; and agreed to furniſh, ſor four months, a monthly ſubſidy of
                    3000 l. to defray the expence of reducing them to obedience. The queen dowager
                    and the French faction were eager, at the same time, to concur in avenging the
                    aſſaſſination of a man to whoſe counſels and ſervices they were ſo greatly
                    indebted. — And that no dangerous uſe might be made of the eldeſt ſon of the
                    earl of Arran, who, after his father, was the heir of the monarchy, an act of
                    parliament was paſſed, excluding him ſrom his birthright white he remained in
                    the poſſeſſion of the enemies of his country, and ſubſtituting his brothers in
                    his place, according to their ſeniority. The dark politics of Henry ſuggeſted
                    the neceſſity of this expedient; and in its meaning and tendency there may be
                    remarked the ſpirit and greatneſs of a free people.</p>
                <p>A powerful army laid ſiege to the caſtle of St Andrew’s, and continued their
                    operations during four months; but no ſucceſs attended the aſſailants. The
                    fortifications were ſtrong; and a communication with the beſieged was open by
                    ſea to the king of England, who ſupplied them with arms and proviſions. The
                    garriſon received his pay, and the principal conſpirators had penſions from him.
                    In return for his generoſity, they were engaged to promote the marriage of his
                    ſon with the young queen; to advance the reformation; and to keep in cuſtody the
                    eldeſt ſon of the regent. Negociation fucceeded to hoſtility; and as the regent
                    expected aſſiſtance from France, and the conſpirators had the proſpect of
                    ſupport from an Engliſh army, both parties were difpoſed to gaiu time. A treaty
                    was entered into and tranſacted, in which the regent engaged to procure from
                    Rome an abſolution to the conſpirators, and to obtain to them from the three
                    eſtates an exemption from proſecutions of every kind. Upon the part of the
                    beſieged, it was ſtipulated, that when theſe conditions were fulfilled, the
                    caſtle ſhould be ſurrendered, and the regent's son be delivered up to him. In
                    the mean time Henry VIII. died; and a few weeks after Francis I, alſo paid his
                    debt to nature. But the former, before his death, had recommended the
                    proſecution of the Scottiſh war; and Henry II. the ſucceſſor of Francis, was
                    eager to ſhow his attention to the ancient ally of his nation. When the
                    abſolution arrived from Rome, the conſpirators refilled to conſider it as valid;
                    and an expreſſion uſed by the pope, implying an abſurdity, furniſhed an apology
                    for their conduct. They knew that the counſellors of Edward VI. were making
                    vigorous preparations to invade Scotland; they were confident of their preſent
                    ability to defend themſelves; and the<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0031.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0025"/> advocates for the reformation encouraged them
                    with hopes and with flattery.</p>
                <p>The favourers of the reformation, in the mean time, adopting the intolerant
                    maxims of the Roman Catholics, were highly pleaſed with the aſſaſſination of
                    Beaton; and many of them congratulated the conspirators upon what they called
                    their godly deed and enterpriſe. John Rough, who had formerly been chaplain to
                    the regent, entered the caſtle and joined them. At this time alſo John Knox
                    began to diſtinguiſh himſelf in an eminent manner, both by his ſucceſs in
                    argument and the unbounded freedom of his diſcourſe; while the Roman clergy,
                    every where defeated and aſhamed, implored the aſſiſtance of the regent and his
                    council, who aſſured them that the laws againſt heretics ſhould be put in
                    execution.</p>
                <p>In the mean time the caſtle of St Andrew’s being inveſted by a fleet of 16 ſail
                    under admiral Strozzi from France, was obliged to capitulate. Honourable
                    conditions were granted to the conſpirators; but after being conveyed to France,
                    they were cruelly uſed, from the hatred entertained by the Catholics againſt the
                    Proteſtants. Many were confined in priſons; and others, among whom, ſays Dr
                    Stuart, was John Knox, were ſent to the galleys. The caſtle itſelf was raſed to
                    the ground.</p>
                <p>The ſame year, 1547, Scotland was invaded by an Engliſh army under the duke of
                    Somerſet, who had been choſen protector of England during the minority of Edward
                    VI. The deſign of this invaſion was to oblige the Scots to comply with the
                    ſcheme of Henry VIII. and conclude a marriage between Edward and the young queen
                    of Scotland. The Engliſh army conſiſted of 18,000 men; beſides which the
                    protector had a fleet of 60 fail, one half of which were ſhips of war, and the
                    others conſiſted of veſſels laden with proviſions and military ſtores. On the
                    other hand, the regent oppoſed him with an army of 40,000 men. Before the
                    commencement of hoſtilities, however, the duke of Somerſet addreſſed a letter or
                    manifeſto to the government, in which he preſſed the marriage with ſuch powerful
                    arguments, and ſo clearly ſhowed the benefits which would reſult from it to both
                    nations, that the regent and his party, who were averſe to peace, thought proper
                    to ſuppreſs it, and to circulate a report that the Engliſh had come to force
                    away the queen, and to reduce the kingdom to a ſtate of dependence. All hopes of
                    an accommodation being thus removed, the Engliſh army advanced in order to give
                    battle to the Scots. They found the latter poſted in the moſt advantageous
                    ſituation, around the villages of Muſſelburgh, Invereſk, and Monckton; ſo that
                    he could not force them to an action, at the ſame time that he found himſelf in
                    danger of having his communication with his ſhips cut off, which would have
                    totally deprived his army of the means of ſubſiſtence. In this dangerous
                    ſituation he had again recourſe to negociation, and offered terms ſtill more
                    favourable than before. He now declared himſelf ready to retire into England,
                    and to make ample compenſation for the injuries committed by his army, if the
                    Scottiſh government would promiſe that the queen ſhould not be contracted to a
                    foreign prince, but ſhould be kept at home till ſhe was of age to chooſe a
                    huſband for herſelf, with the conſent of the nobility. Theſe conceſſions
                    increaſed the confidence of the regent ſo much, that,</p>
                <p>without taking advantage of the ſtrength of his ſituation, he reſolved to come to
                    a general engagement.— The protector moved towards Pinkey, a gentleman’s houſe
                    to the eaſtward of Muſſelburgh; and the regent conceiving that he meant to take
                    refuge in his fleet, changed the ſtrong ground in which he was encamped. He
                    commanded his army to paſs the river Eſk, and to approach the Engliſh forces,
                    which were poſted on the middle of Faſideſhill. The earl of Angus led on the
                    van; the main body of the battle marched under the regent; and the earl of
                    Huntley commanded in the rear. It was the regent’s intention to ſeize the top of
                    the hill. The lord Gray, to defeat this purpoſe, charged the earl of Angus, at
                    the head of the Engliſh cavalry. They were received upon the points of the
                    Scottiſh ſpears, which were longer than the lances of the Engliſh horſemen, and
                    put to flight. The earl of Warwick, more ſucceſsful with his command of
                    infantry, advanced to the attack. The ordnance from the fleet aſſiſted his
                    operations; and a briſk fire from the Engliſh artillery, which was planted on a
                    riſing ground, ſerved ſtill more to intimidate the Scottiſh ſoldiery.— The
                    remaining troops under the protector were moving ſlowly, and in the beſt order,
                    to take a ſhare in the engagement. The earl of Angus was not well ſupported by
                    the regent and the earl of Huntley. A panic ſpread itſelf through the Scottiſh
                    army. It fled in different ways, preſenting a ſcene of the greateſt havoc and
                    confuſion. Few periſhed in the fight; but the chaſe continuing in one direction
                    to Edinburgh, and in another to Dalkeith, with the utmoſt fury, a prodigious
                    ſlaughter was made. The loſs of the conquerors did not amount to 500 men; but
                    10,000 ſoldiers periſhed on the fide of the vanquiſhed. A multitude of priſoners
                    were taken; and among theſe the earl of Huntley, the lord high chancellor.</p>
                <p>Amidſt the conſternation of this deciſive victory, the duke of Somerſet had a
                    full opportunity of effectuating the marriage and union projected by Henry VIII.
                    and on the ſubject of which ſuch fond anxiety was entertained by the Engliſh
                    nation. But the cabals of his enemies threatening his deſtruction at home, he
                    yielded to the neceſſities of his private ambition, and marched back into
                    England. He took precautions, however, to ſecure an entry into Scotland, both by
                    ſea and land. A garriſon of 200 men was placed in the iſle of St Columba in the
                    Forth, and two ſhips of war were left as a guard to it. A garriſon was alſo
                    ſtationed in the caſtle of Broughty, which was ſituated in the mouth of the Tay.
                    When he paſſed through the Merſe and Teviotdale, the leading men of theſe
                    counties repaired to him; and taking an oath of allegiance to king Edward,
                    ſurrendered their places of ſtrength. Some of theſe he demoliſhed, and to others
                    he added new fortifications. Hume caſtle was garriſoned with 200 men, and
                    intruded to Sir Edward Dudley; and he poſted 300 ſoldiers, with 200 pioneers, in
                    the caſtle of Roxburgh, under the command of Sir Ralph Bulmer.</p>
                <p>The only reſource of the regent now was the hope of aſſiſtance from France. The
                    young queen was lodged in the caſtle of Dumbarton, under the care of the lords
                    Erſkine and Livingſtone; and ambaſſadors were ſent to Henry II. of France,
                    acquainting him with the diſaſter at Pinkey, and imploring his aſſiſtance. The
                        regent<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0032.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0026"/> had
                    aſked permiſſion from the protector to treat of peace, and the earl of Warwick
                    was appointed to wait for them at Berwick; but none were ever ſent on the part
                    of Scotland. It was not long, therefore, before hostilities were recommenced by
                    the Engliſh. Lord Gray led an army into Scotland, fortified the town of
                    Haddington, took the caſtles of Yeſter and Dalkeitſh, laid waſte the Merſe, and
                    the counties of Eaſt and Mid Lothian. On the other hand, in June 1548, Monſieur
                    de Deſſe, a French officer of great reputation, landed at Leith with 6000
                    ſoldiers, and a formidable train of artillery.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the regent was in diſgrace on account of the diſaſter at
                    Pinkey; and the queen-dowager being diſpoſed to ſuperſede his authority,
                    attempted to improve this circumſtance to her own advantage. As ſhe perceived
                    that her power and intereſt could beſt be ſupported by France, ſhe reſolved to
                    enter into the ſtricteſt alliance with that kingdom. It had been propoſed that
                    the dauphin of France ſhould marry the queen of Scotland; and this propoſal now
                    met with many partizans, the hoſtilities of the Engliſh having loſt a great
                    number of friends to the cauſe of that country. It was reſolved to ſend the
                    queen immediately to France, which would remove the cauſe of the preſent
                    contentions, and her ſubſequent marriage with the dauphin would in the fulleſt
                    manner confirm the friendſhip betwixt the two nations. The French government
                    alſo entered deeply into the ſcheme; and in order to promote it made preſents of
                    great value to many of the Scottiſh nobility. The regent himſelf was gained over
                    by a penſion of 12,000 livres, and the title of duke of Chatelherault. Monſieur
                    de Villegagnon, who commanded four galleys in the harbour of Leith, making a
                    feint as if he intended to proceed inſtantly to France, tacked about to the
                    north, and, ſailing round the iſles, received the queen at Dumbarton; whence he
                    conveyed her to France, and delivered her to her uncles the princes of Lorraine,
                    in the month of July 1548.</p>
                <p>Theſe tranſactions did not put an end to the military operations. The ſiege of
                    Haddington had been undertaken as ſoon as the French auxiliaries arrived, and
                    was now conducted with vigour. To reinforce the garriſon, 1500 horſe advanced
                    from Berwick; but an ambuſcade being laid for them, they were intercepted, and
                    almoſt totally deſtroyed. Another body of Engliſh troops, however, which
                    amounted only to 300 perſons, was more ſucceſsful. Eluding the vigilance of the
                    Scots and the French, they were able to enter Haddington, and to ſupply the
                    beſieged with ammunition and proviſions. The lord Seymour, high admiral of
                    England, made a deſcent upon Fife with 1200 men, and ſome pieces of artillery;
                    but was driven back to his ſhips with great ſlaughter by James Stuart, natural
                    brother to the young queen, who oppoſed him at the head of the militia of the
                    county. A ſecond deſcent was made by him at Montroſe; but being equally
                    unſucceſsful there, he was obliged to leave Scotland without performing any
                    important or memorable achievement.</p>
                <p>Having collected an army of 17,000 men, and adding to it 3000 German Proteſtants,
                    the protector put it under the direction of the earl of Shrewſhury. Upon the
                    approach of the Engliſh, Deſſe, though he had</p>
                <p>been reinforced with 15,000 Scots, thought it more prudent to retreat than to
                    hazard a deciſive battle. He raiſed the ſiege of Haddington, and marched to
                    Edinburgh. The earl of Shrewſhury did not follow him to force an engagement;
                    jealouſies had ariſen between the Scots and the French. The inſolence and vanity
                    of the latter, encouraged by their ſuperior ſkill in military arts, had offended
                    the quick and impatient ſpirit of the former. The fretfulneſs of the Scots was
                    augmented by the calamities inſeparable from war; and after the conveyance of
                    the young queen to France, the efficacious and peculiar advantage conferred upon
                    that kingdom by this tranſaction was fully underſtood, and appeared to them to
                    be highly diſgraceful and impolitic. In this ſtate of their humour, Deſſe found
                    not at Edinburgh the reception he expected. The quartering of his ſoldiers
                    produced diſputes, which ended in an inſurrection of the inhabitants. The French
                    fired among the citizens. Several perſons of diſtinction fell, and among theſe
                    were the provoſt of Edinburgh and his ſon. The national diſcontents and
                    inquietudes were driven, by this event, to the moſt dangerous extremity; and
                    Deſſe, who was a man of ability, thought of giving, employment to his troops,
                    and of flattering the people by the ſplendour of ſome martial exploit.</p>
                <p>The earl of Shrewſhury, after ſupplying Haddington with troops, proviſions, and
                    military ſtores, retired with his army into England. Its garriſon, in the
                    enjoyment oſ ſecurity, and unſuſpicious of danger, might be ſurpriſed and
                    overpowered. Marching in the night, Deſſe reached this important poſt; and
                    deſtroying a fort of obſervation, prepared to ſtorm the main gates of the city,
                    when the garriſon took the alarm. A French deſerter pointing a double cannon to
                    the thickeſt ranks of the aſſailants, the ſhot was incredibly deſtructive, and
                    threw them into confusion. In the height of their conſternation, a vigorous
                    ſally was made by the beſieged. Deſſe renewed the aſſault in the morning, and
                    was again diſcomfited. He now turned his arms againſt Broughty caſtle; and,
                    though unable to reduce it, he yet recovered the neighbouring town of Dundee,
                    which had fallen into the poſſeſſion of the enemy. Flume caſtle was retaken by
                    ſtratagem. Deſſe entered Jedburgh, and put its garriſon to the ſword. Encouraged
                    by this ſucceſs, he ravaged the Engliſh borders in different incurſions, and
                    obtained ſeveral petty victories. Leith, which from a ſmall village had grown
                    into a town, was fortified by him; and the iſland of Inchkeith, which is nearly
                    oppoſite to that harbour, being occupied by Engliſh troops, he undertook to
                    expel them, and made them priſoners after a briſk encounter.</p>
                <p>His activity and valour could not, however, compoſe the diſcontents of the
                    Scottiſh nation; and the queen-dowager having written to Henry II. to recal him,
                    he was ſucceeded in his command by Monſieur de Thermes, who was accompanied into
                    Scotland by Monluc biſhop of Valence, a perſon highly eſteemed for his addreſs
                    and ability. This eccleſiaſtic was deſigned to ſupply the loſs of cardinal
                    Beaton, and to diſcharge the office of lord high chancellor of Scotland. But the
                    jealouſies of the nation increaſing, and the queen-dowager herſelf ſuſpecting
                    his ambition and turbulence, he attained not this dignity, and ſoon returned to
                    his own country.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0033.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0027"
                    /> De Thermes brought with him from France a reinforcement of 1000 foot, 2000
                    horſe, and 100 men- at-arms. He erected a fort at Aberlady, to diſtreſs the
                    garriſon of Haddington, and to intercept its ſupplies of proviſion. At
                    Coldingham he deſtroyed a troop of Spaniards in the Engliſh pay. Faſt-caſtle was
                    regained by ſurpriſe. Diſtractions in the Engliſh court did not permit the
                    protector to act vigorouſly in the war. The earl of Warwick was diverted from
                    marching an army into Scotland. An infectious diſtemper had broke out in the
                    garriſon at Haddington; and an apprehenſion prevailed, that it could not hold
                    out for any length of time againſt the Scots, The earl of Rutland, therefore,
                    with a body of troops, entered the town; and after ſetting fire to it, conducted
                    the garriſon and artillery to Berwick. The regent, in the poſſeſſion of
                    Haddington, was solicitous to recover the other places which were yet in the
                    power of the Engliſh. De Thermes laid ſiege to Broughty caſtle, and took it. He
                    then beſieged Lawder; and the garriſon was about to ſurrender at diſcretion,
                    when the news arrived that a peace was concluded between France, England, and
                    Scotland.</p>
                <p>By this treaty Henry IT. obtained the reſtitution of Boulogne and its
                    dependencies, which had been taken from him by the king of England, and for
                    which he paid 400,000 crowns, No oppoſition was to be given to the marriage of
                    the queen of Scotland with the dauphin: the fortreſſes of Lawder and Douglas
                    were to be reſtored to the Scots, and the Engliſh were to deſtroy the caſtles of
                    Roxburgh and Eymouth. After the ratification of the articles, the queen-dowager
                    embarked with Leon Strozzi for France, attended by many of the nobility. Having
                    arrived there, ſhe communicated to the king her deſign of affirming the
                    government of Scotland, and he promiſed to aſſiſt her to the utmost of his
                    power. But the jealouſy which prevailed between the Scots and French rendered
                    the accompliſhment of this deſign very difficult. To remove the regent by an act
                    of power might endanger the ſcheme altogether; but it might be poſſible to
                    perſuade him to reſign his office voluntarily. For this purpoſe intrigues were
                    immediately commenced; and indeed the regent himſelf contributed to promote
                    their ſchemes by his violent perſecution oſ the reformed. The peace was hardly
                    proclaimed, when he provoked the public reſentment by an action of ſanguinary
                    inſolence. Adam Wallace, a man of ſimple manners, but of great zeal for the
                    reformation, was accuſed of hereſy, and brought to trial in the church of the
                    Black Friars at Edinburgh. In the preſence of the regent, the earls of Angus,
                    Huntley, Glencaim, and other perſons of diſtinction and rank, he was charged
                    with preaching without any authority of law, with baptizing one of his own
                    children, and with denying the doctrine of purgatory; and it was ftrenuouſly
                    objected to him, that he accounted prayers to the faints and the dead to be an
                    uleleſs ſuperſtition, that he had pronounced the maſs to be an idolatrous
                    ſervice, and that he had affirmed that the bread and wine in the ſacrament of
                    the altar, after the words of the conſecration, do not change their nature, but
                    continue to be bread and wine. Theſe offences were eſteemed too terrible to
                    admit of any pardon.— The earl of Glencairn alone proteſted againſt his
                    puniſhment. The pious ſufferer bore with reſignation the</p>
                <p>contumelious inſults of the clergy; and by his courage and patience at the ſtake
                    gave a fonction to the opinions he had embraced.</p>
                <p>Other acts of atrocity and violence ſtained the adminiſtration of the regent. In
                    his own palace, William Crichton, a man of family and reputation, was
                    aſſaſſinanated by the lord Semple. No attempt was made to puniſh the murderer.
                    His daughter was the concubine of the archbiſhop of St Andrew’s, and her tears
                    and intreaties were more powerful than juſtice. John Melvil, a perſon
                    reſpectable by his birth and his fortune, had written to an Engliſh gentleman,
                    recommending to his care a friend who at that time was a captive in England.
                    This letter contained no improper information in matters of ſtate, and no
                    ſuſpicion of any crime againſt Melvil could be inferred from it. Yet the regent
                    brought him to trial upon a charge of high treaſon; and, for an act of humanity
                    and friendſhip, he was condemned to loſe his head. The eſtate of Melvil,
                    forfeited to his family, was given to David the youngeſt ſoil of the regent.</p>
                <p>Amidſt the pleaſures and amuſements of the French court, the queen-dowager was
                    not inattentive to the ſcheme of ambition which ſhe had projected. The earls of
                    Huntley and Sutherland, Mariſchal and Caſſilis, with the lord Maxwell, and other
                    perſons of eminence who had accompanied her to France, were gained over to her
                    intereſts, Robert Carnegie of Kinnaird, David Panter biſhop of Rofs, and Gavin
                    Hamilton commendator of Kilwinning, being alſo at this time in that kingdom, and
                    having the greateſt weight with the regent, were treated with a moſt punctilious
                    reſpect. Henry declared to them his earneſt wiſh that the queen-dowager might
                    attain the government of Scotland. In cafe the regent ſhould conſent to this

                    conſequence and affairs; and he deſired them to inform him, that he had already
                    confirmed his title of <hi rend="italic">duke oſ Chatelherault,</hi> had
                    advanced his ſon to be captain oſ the Scots gendarmes in France, and was ready
                    to tender other marks of favour to his family and relations. Upon this buſineſs,
                    and with this meſſage, Mr Carnegie was diſpatched to Scotland; and a few days
                    after, he was followed by the biſhop of Roſs. The biſhop being a man of
                    eloquence and authority, obtained, though with great difficulty, a promiſe from
                    the regent to reſign his high office; and for this ſervice he received, as a
                    recompenſe, an abbey in Poitou.</p>
                <p>The queen-dowager, full of hopes, now prepared to return to Scotland, and in her
                    way thither made uſe of a safe-conduct obtained from Edward VI. by the king of
                    France, The Engliſh monarch, however, had not yet forgot the beautiful queen of
                    Scotland; and did not fail to urge his ſuperiority of claim to her over the
                    dauphin. The queen-dowager did not ſeriouſly enter upon the buſineſs; only in
                    general terms complained of the hoſtilities committed by the Engliſh; and two
                    days after this converſation, ſhe proceeded towards Scotland, where ſhe was
                    conducted by the earl of Bothwel, lord Hume, and ſome other noblemen, to
                    Edinburgh, amidſt the acclamations of the people. She had not long been returned
                    to the capital, when the bad conduct of the regent afforded her an opportunity
                    of exerting her influence and addreſs to the advantage of her project. The
                    regent having propoſed a judicial circuit through<pb

                    under pretence of repreſſing crimes and diſorders, moleſted the people by
                    plunder and rapine. Great fines were levied for offences pretended as well as
                    real; and the Proteſtants in particular ſeemed to be the objects of his
                    diſpleaſure and ſeverity. In his progreſs he was accompanied by the
                    queen-dowager; and as ſhe affected to behave in a manner directly oppoſite, the
                    moſt diſagreeable compariſons were made between her and the regent. The biſhop
                    of Roſs, to whom he had promiſed to reſign his office, did not fail to put him
                    in mind of his engagements; but he had now altered his mind, and wiſhed ſtill to
                    continue in power. His reſolution, however, failed him on the firſt intimation
                    of a parliamentary inquiry into the errors of his adminſtration. An agreement
                    with the queen-dowager then took place; and it was ſtipulated, that he ſhould
                    ſucceed to the throne upon the death of the queen without iſſue; that his ſon
                    ſhould enjoy the command of the gendarmes; that no inquiry ſhould be made into
                    his expenditure of the royal treaſures; that no ſcrutiny into his government
                    ſhould take place; and that he ſhould enjoy in the moſt ample manner his duchy
                    and his penſion. Theſe articles were ratified at an aſſembly of parliament, and
                    the queen-dowager was formally inveſted with the regency.</p>
                <p>Mary of Lorraine, the new regent, though ſhe had with great difficulty attained
                    the ſummit of her wiſhes, ſeemed to be much leſs verſant in the arts of
                    government than of intrigue. She was ſcarcely ſettled in her new office when ſhe
                    rendered herſelf unpopular in two reſpects; one was by her too great attachment
                    to France, and the other by her persecution of the reformed religion. She was
                    entirely guided by the councils of her brothers the duke of Guiſe and the
                    cardinal of Lorraine; and paid by far too much attention to M. d’Oyſel the
                    French ambaiſador, whom they recommended to her as an able and faithful
                    miniſter. Several high offices were filled with Frenchmen, which excited in the
                    higheſt degree the reſentment of the Scottiſh nobility; and the commonalty were
                    inſtantly prejudiced againſt her by the partiality ſhe ſhowed to the Papiſts. At
                    firſt, however, ſhe enacted many ſalutary laws; and while ſhe made a progreſs
                    herſelf through the ſouthern provinces of the kingdom to hold juſticiary courts,
                    ſhe endeavoured to introduce order and law into the weſtern counties and iſles;
                    firſt by the earl of Huntley, and afterwards by the earls of Argyle and Athole,
                    to whom ſhe granted commiſſions for this purpoſe with effectual powers. In
                    another, improvement, which the queen-regent attempted by the advice of her
                    French council, ſhe found herſelf oppoſed by her own people. It was propoſed
                    that the poſſeſſions of every proprietor of land in the kingdom ſhould be valued
                    and entered into regiſters; and that a proportional payment ſhould be made by
                    each. The application of this fund was to maintain a regular and ſtanding body
                    of ſoldiers. This guard or army, it was urged, being at all times in readineſs
                    to march againſt an enemy, would protect effectually the frontiers; and there
                    would no longer be any neceſſity for the nobles to be continually in motion
                    on</p>
                <p>every rumour of hoſtility or incurſion from Engliſh invaders. No art, however, or
                    argnment, could recommend theſe meaſures. A perpetual tax and a ſtanding army
                    were conceived to be the genuine characteriſtics of deſpotiſm. All ranks of men
                    conſidered themſelves inſulted and abuſed; and 300 tenants of the crown
                    aſſembling at Edinburgh, and giving way to their indignation, ſent their
                    remonſtrances to the queen-regent in ſuch ſtrong and expreſſive language, as
                    induced her to abandon the ſcheme. Yet ſtill the attempt which ſhe had made left
                    an impreſſion in the minds of the people. They ſuſpected her to be a ſecret
                    enemy to their government and liberties; and they were convinced that Henry II.
                    was engaging her in refinements and artifices, that he might reduce Scotland to
                    be a province of France.</p>
                <p>While an alarm about their civil rights was ſpreading itſelf among the people,
                    the Proteſtants were riling daily in their ſpirit and in their hopes. John
                        Knox<note anchored="true" n="3" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>When he
                            was sent to France (says Dr Stuart), with the conspirators against

                            liberty in the latter end of the year 1549.</p></note> (P), whoſe
                    courage had been confirmed by misfortunes, and whoſe talents had improved by
                    exerciſe, was at this time making a progreſs through Scotland. The
                    characteriſtic peculiarities of Popery were the favourite topics of his
                    declamation and cenſure. He treated the maſs, in particular, with the moſt
                    ſovereign contempt, repreſenting it as a remnant of idolatry. Many of the
                    nobility and gentry afforded him countenance and protection. They invited him to
                    preach at their houſes, and they partook with him in the ordinances of religion
                    after the reformed method. Religious ſocieties and aſſemblies were held
                    publicly, in defiance of the Papiſts; and celebrated preachers were courted with
                    aſſiduity and bribes to reſide and officiate in particular diſtricts and towns.
                    The clergy cited him to appear before them at Edinburgh, in the church of the
                    Black-friars. On the appointed day he preſented himſelf, with a numerous
                    attendance of gentlemen, who were determined to exert themſelves in his behalf.
                    The prieſthood did not chooſe to proceed in his proſecution; and Knox,
                    encouraged by this ſymptom of their fear, took the reſolution to explain and
                    inculcate his doctrines repeatedly and openly in the capital city of Scotland.
                    In 1556, the earl of Glencairn allured the earl Mariſchal to hear the
                    exhortations of this celebrated preacher; and they were ſo much affected with
                    his reaſonings and rhetoric, that they requeſted him to addreſs the queen-regent
                    upon the ſubject of the reformation of religion. In compliance with this
                    requeſt, he wrote a letter in very diſagreeable terms; and the earl of Glencairn
                    delivered it with his own hand, in the expectation that ſome advantage might in
                    this manner be obtained for the reformed. But the queen-regent was no leſs
                    offended with the freedom of the nobleman than the preacher; and, after peruſing
                    the paper, ſhe gave it to James Beaton arch- biſhop of Glaſgow, with an
                    expreſſion of diſdain, “Here, my lord, is a paſquil.”</p>
                <p>Amidſt theſe occupations, John Knox received, an invitation to take the charge of
                    the Engliſh congregation at Geneva; which he accepted. The clergy called upon
                    him, in his abſence, to appear before them, condemn-<pb

                    death as a heretic, and ordered him to be burned in effigy.</p>
                <p>The injurious treatment of John Knox did not in the leaſt obſtruct the progreſs
                    of the reformation. Deſertions were made from Popery in every town and village;
                    and even many members of the church, both ſecular and regular, were forward to
                    embrace the new principles, and to atone for their paſt miſtakes by the
                    bittereſt railleries againſt the corruptions and the folly of the Romiſh faith.
                    The prieſts were treated in all places with ridicule and contempt. The images,
                    crucifixes, and relics, which ſerved to rouſe the decaying fervours of
                    ſuperſtition, were ſtolen from the churches, and trampled under foot. The
                    biſhops implored the aſſiſtance of the queen-regent. Citations were given to the
                    preachers to appear in their defence. They obeyed; but with ſuch a formidable
                    retinue, that it was with difficulty ſhe was permitted to apologiſe for her
                    conduct. James Chalmers of Gaitgirth, preſſing forward from the crowd, addreſſed
                    himſelf to her: “We vow to God, that the devices of the prelates ſhall not be
                    carried into execution. We are oppreſſed to maintain them in their idleneſs.
                    They ſeek to undo and murder our preachers and us; and we are determined to
                    ſubmit no longer to this wickedneſs.” The multitude, applauding his ſpeech, put
                    their hands to their daggers.</p>
                <p>A truſty meſſenger was diſpatched to Geneva, inviting John Knox to return to his
                    own country. But in the infancy of their connection, the Proteſtants being
                    apprehenſive of one another, uncertain in their counſels, or being deſerted by
                    perſens upon whom they had relied, it appeared to them that they had adopted
                    this meaſure without a due preparation; and, by oppoſite diſpatches, Knox was
                    requeſted to delay his journey for ſome time.</p>
                <p>To this zealous reformer their unſteadineſs was a matter of ſerious affliction;
                    and in the anſwer he tranſmitted to their letters, he rebuked them with
                    ſeverity: but amidſt this correction, he intreated them not to faint under their
                    purpoſes, from apprehensions of danger, which, he ſaid, was to ſeparate
                    themſelves from the favour of God, and to provoke his vengeance. To particular
                    perſons he wrote other addreſſes; and to all of them the greateſt attention was
                    paid. In 1557, a formal bond of agreement, which obtained the appellation of <hi
                        rend="italic">the first covenant,</hi> was entered into, and all the more
                    eminent perſons who favoured the reformation were invited to ſubſcribe it. The
                    earls of Argyle, Glencairn, and Morton, with the lord Lorn, and John Erſkine of
                    Dun, led the way, by giving it the ſanction of their names. All the ſubſcribers
                    to this deed, renouncing the ſuperſtitions and idolatry of the church of Rome,
                    promiſed to apply continually their whole power and wealth, and even to give up
                    their lives, to forward and eſtabliſh the word of God. They diſtinguiſhed the
                    reformed, by calling them the <hi rend="italic">Congregation of Christ;</hi> and
                    by the opprobrious title of the <hi rend="italic">Congregation of Satan,</hi>
                    they peculiarized the favourers of Popery.</p>
                <p>After the leaders of the reformation had ſubſcribed the firſt covenant, they
                    addreſſed letters to John Knox, urging in the ſtrongeſt terms his return to
                    Scotland; and that their hopes of his aſſiſtance might not be diſappointed, they
                    lent an addreſs to John Calvin, the celebrated reformer, begging him to join his
                    commands to their intreaties. The archbiſhop of St Andrew’s, who perceived the
                    riſing ſtorm, was in a difficult ſituation. A powerful combination threatened
                    ruin to the church; and he had ſeparated himſelf from the politics of the
                    queen-regent. The zeal of the Roman Catholics pointed out ſtrong meaſures to
                    him; and his diſpoſitions were pacific. The clergy were offended with his
                    remiſſneſs and neglect of duty. The reformers deteſted his looſeneſs of
                    principles, and were ſhocked with the diſſolute depravity of his life and
                    converſation. He reſolved to try the force of addreſs, and did not ſucceed. He
                    then reſolved to be ſevere, and was ſtill more unſucceſsful.</p>
                <p>The earl of Argyle was the moſt powerful of the reformed leaders. To allure him
                    from his party, the archbiſhop of St Andrew’s employed the agency of Sir David
                    Hamilton. But the kindneſs he affected, and the advices he beſtowed, were no
                    compliment to the underſtanding of this nobleman; and his threats were regarded
                    with ſcorn. The reformers, inſtead of loſing their courage, felt a ſentiment of
                    exultation and triumph; and the earl of Argyle happening to die about this time,
                    he not only maintained the new doctrines in his laſt moments, but intreated his
                    ſon to ſeek for honour in promoting the public preaching of the goſpel and Jeſus
                    Chriſt, and in the utter ruin of ſuperſtition and idolatry.</p>
                <p>It was determined by the archbiſhop and the prelates, that this diſappointment
                    ſhould be ſucceeded by furious perſecution of the reformed. Walter Mill, a
                    prieſt, had neglected to officiate at the altar; and having been long under the
                    ſuſpicion of hereſy, was carried to St Andrew’s, committed to priſon, and
                    accuſed before the archbiſhop and his ſuffragans. He was in an extreme old age;
                    and he had ſtruggled all his life with poverty. He ſunk not, however, under the
                    hardneſs of his fate. To the articles of his accuſation he replied with ſignal
                    recollection and fortitude. The firmneſs of his mind, in the emaciated ſtate of
                    his body, excited admiration. The inſultsr of his enemies, and their contempt,
                    ſerved to diſcover his ſuperiority over them. When the clergy declared him a
                    heretic, no temporal judge could be found to condemn him to the fire. He was
                    reſpited to another day; and ſo great ſympathy prevailed for his misfortunes,
                    that it was neceſſary to allure one of the archbiſhop’s domeſtics to ſupply the
                    place of the civil power, and to pronounce the lenience of condemnation. When
                    brought to the ſtake, the reſolution of this ſufferer did not forſake him. He
                    praiſed God, that he had been called to ſeal up the truth with his life; and he
                    conjured the people, as they would eſcape eternal death, not to be overcome by
                    the errors and the artifices of monks and prieſts, abbots and biſhops.</p>
                <p>The barbarity of this execution affected the reformers with inexpreſſible horror.
                    Subſcriptions for mutual defence were taken. The leaders of the reformation,
                    diſperſing their emiſſaries to every quarter, encouraged the vehemence of the
                    multitude. The covenant to eſtabliſh a new form of religion extended far and
                    wide. The ſharp point of the ſword, not the calm exertions of inquiry, was to
                    decide the diſputes of theology.</p>
                <p>When the leaders of the reformation were appriſed of the ardent zeal of the
                    people, and conſidered the great number of ſubſcriptions which had been
                    collected in the different counties of the kingdom, they aſſembled<pb

                    concerning the ſteps to be purſued, It was reſolved, accordingly, that a public
                    and common ſupplication of the whole body of the Proteſtants ſhould be preſented
                    to the queen-regent; which, after complaining of the injuries they had ſuſſered,
                    ſhould require her to beſtow upon them her ſupport and aſſiſtance, and urge her
                    to proceed in the work of a reformation. To explain their full meaning, a
                    ſchedule, containing particular demands, was at the ſame time to be preſented to
                    her ſcrutiny. To Sir James Sandilands of Calder they committed the important
                    charge of their manifeſto and articles of reformation; and in appointing him to
                    this commiſſion, they conſulted the reſpect which was due both to the government
                    and to themſelves. His character was in the higheſt eſtimation. His ſervices to
                    his country were numerous; his integrity and honour were ſuperior to all
                    ſuſpicion; and his age and experience gave him authority and reverence.</p>
                <p>The petition or ſupplication of the Proteſtants was expreſſed in ſtrong but
                    reſpectful terms. They told the queen-regent, that though they had been provoked
                    by great injuries, they had yet, during a long period, abſtained from aſſembling
                    themſelves, and from making known to her their complaints. Baniſhment,
                    confiſcation of goods, and death in its moſt cruel ſhape, were evils with which
                    the reformed had been afflicted; and they were ſtill expoſed to theſe dreadful
                    calamities. Compelled by their ſufferings, they preſumed to aſk a remedy againſt
                    the tyranny of the prelates and the eſtate eccleſiaſtical. They had uſurped an
                    unlimited domination over thc minds of men. Whatever they commanded, though
                    without any ſanction from the word of God, muſt be obeyed. Whatever they
                    prohibited, tho’ from their own authority only, it was neceſſary to avoid. All
                    arguments and remonſtrances were equally fruitleſs and vain. The fire, the
                    faggot, and the ſword, were the weapons with which the church enforced and
                    vindicated her mandates. By theſe, of late years, many of their brethren had
                    fallen; and upon this account they were troubled and wounded in their
                    conſciences. For conceiving themſelves to be a part of that power which God had
                    eſtabliſhed in this kingdom, it was their duty to have defended them, or to have
                    concurred with them in an open avowal of their common religion. They now take
                    the opportunity to make this avowal. They break a ſilence which may be
                    miſinterpreted into a juftification of the cruelties of their enemies. And
                    diſdaining all farther diſſimulation in matters which concern the glory of God,
                    their preſent happineſs, and their future ſalvation, they demand, that the
                    original purity of the Chriſtian religion ſhall be reſtored, and that the
                    government ſhall be ſo improved, as to afford to them a ſecurity in their
                    perſons, their opinions, and their property.</p>
                <p>With this petition or ſupplication of the Proteſtants, Sir James Sandilands
                    preſented their ſchedule of demands, or the preliminary articles of the
                    reformation. They were in the ſpirit of their ſupplication, and of the following
                    tenor.</p>
                <p>I. It ſhall be lawful to the reformed to peruſe the Scriptures in the vulgar
                    tongue; and to employ alſo their native language in prayer publicly and in
                    private.</p>
                <p>II. It ſhall be permitted to any perſon qualified by knowledge, to interpret and
                    explain the difficult paſſages in the Scriptures.</p>
                <p>III. The election of miniſters ſhall take place according to the rules of the
                    primitive church; and thoſe who elect ſhall inquire diligently into the lives
                    and doctrines of the perſons whom they admit to the clerical office.</p>
                <p>IV. The holy ſacrament of baptiſm ſhall be celebrated in the vulgar tongue, that
                    its inſtitution and nature may be the more generally underſtood.</p>
                <p>V. The holy ſacrament of the Lord’s ſupper ſhall likewiſe be adminiſtered in the
                    vulgar tongue; and in this communion, as well as in the ceremonial of baptiſm, a
                    becoming reſpect ſhall be paid to the plain inſtitution of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                <p>VI. The wicked and licentious lives of the biſhops and eſtate eccleſiaſtical
                    ſhall be reformed; and if they diſcharge not the duties of true and faithful
                    pallors, they ſhall be compelled to deliſt from their miniſtry and
                    functions.</p>
                <p>The queen-regent now found it neceſſary to flatter the Proteſtants. She aſſured
                    them by Sir James Sandilands, their orator or commiſſioner, that every thing
                    they could legally desire ſhould be granted to them; and that, in the mean time,
                    they might, without moleſtation, employ the vulgar tongue in their prayers and
                    religious exerciſes. But, upon the pretence that no encouragement might be given
                    to tumults and riot, ſhe requeſted that they would held no public aſſemblies in
                    Edinburgh or Leith. The Congregation, for this name was now affirmed by the
                    Proteſtants, were tranſported with theſe tender proofs of her regard; and while
                    they fought to advance ſtill higher in her eſteem by the inoffenſive quietneſs
                    of their carriage, they were encouraged in the undertaking they had begun, and
                    anxious to accompliſh the work of the reformation.</p>
                <p>Nor to the clergy, who at this time were holding a provincial council at
                    Edinburgh, did the Congregation ſcruple to communicate the articles of the
                    intended reformation. The clergy received their demands with a ſtorm of rage,
                    which died away in an innocent debility. Upon recovering from their paſſions,
                    they offered to ſubmit the controverſy between them and the reformed to a public
                    diſputation. The Congregation did not refuſe this mode of trial; and deſired, as
                    their only conditions, that the Scriptures might be conſidered as the ſtandards
                    of orthodoxy and truth, and that thoſe of their brethren who were in exile and
                    under perſecution might be permitted to aſſiſt them. Theſe requeſts, though
                    reaſonable in a high degree, were not complied with; and the church would allow
                    no rule of right but the canon law and its own councils. Terms of reconciliation
                    were then offered on the part of the eſtate eccleſiaſtical. It held out to the
                    Proteſtants the liberty of praying and adminiſtering the ſacraments in the
                    vulgar tongue, if they would pay reverence to the maſs, acknowledge purgatory,
                    invoke the ſaints, and admit of petitions ſor the dead. To conditions ſo
                    ineffectual and abſurd the Congregation did not deign to return any anſwer.</p>
                <p>The meeting of the parliament approached. The parties in contention were agitated
                    with anxieties, apprehenſions, and hopes. An expectation of a firm and open
                    aſſiſtance from the queen-regent gave courage to the reformed; and, from the
                    parliamentary influence of their friends in the greater and the leſſer baronage,
                    they expected the moſt important ſervices. They drew up with eagerneſs the
                    articles which they wiſhed to be<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0037.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0031"/> paſſed into a law; and as the ſpirit and ſenfe
                    of their tranſactions are to be gathered in the completeſt manner from the
                    papers which were framed by themſelves, it is proper to attend to them with a
                    punctilious exactneſs. Their petitions were few and explicit.</p>
                <p>I. They could not, in conſequence of principles which they had embraced from a
                    conviction of their truth, participate in the Romiſh religion. It was therefore
                    their deſire, that all the acts of parliament, giving authority to the church to
                    proceed againſt them as heretics, ſhould be abrogated; or, at leaſt, that their
                    power ſhould be ſuſpended till the diſputes which had ariſen were determined and
                    brought to a concluſion.</p>
                <p>II. They did not mean that all men ſhould be at liberty to profeſs what religion
                    they pleaſed, without the controul of authority. They contented that all
                    tranſgreſſors in matters of faith ſhould be carried before the temporal judge.
                    But it was their wiſh that the clergy ſhould have only the power to accuſe; and
                    they thought it conformable to juſtice, that a copy of the criminal charge
                    ſhould be lodged with the party upon trial, and that a competent time ſhould be
                    allowed him to defend himſelf.</p>
                <p>III. They inſiſted, that every defence conſiſtent with law ſhould be permitted to
                    the party accuſed; and that objections to witneſſes, founded in truth and
                    reaſon, ſhould operate to his favour.</p>
                <p>IV. They deſired that the party accuſed ſhould have permiſſion to interpret and
                    explain his own opinions; and that his declaration ſhould carry a greater
                    evidence than the depoſition of any witneſs: as no perſon ought to be puniſhed
                    for religion, who is not obſtinate in a wicked or damnable tenet.</p>
                <p>V. In fine, they urged, that no Proteſtant ſhould be condemned for hereſy,
                    without being convicted, by the word of God, of the want of that faith which is
                    neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
                <p>The Congregation preſented theſe articles to the queen-regent, expecting that ſhe
                    would not only propoſe them to the three eſtates aſſembled in parliament, but
                    employ all her influence to recommend them. But finding themſelves diſappointed,
                    they began to ſuſpect her ſincerity; and they were ſenſible that their
                    petitions, though they ſhould be carried in parliament, could not paſs into a
                    law without her conſent. They therefore abſtained from preſenting them; but as
                    their complaints and deſires were fully known in parliament, they ordered a
                    ſolemn declaration to be read there in their behalf, and demanded that it ſhould
                    be inſerted in the records of the nation. In this declaration, after expreſſing
                    their regret for having been diſappointed in their ſcheme of reformation, they
                    proteſted, that no blame ſhould be imputed to them for continuing in their
                    religion, which they believed to be founded in the word of God; that no danger
                    of life, and no political pains, ſhould be incurred by them, for diſregarding
                    ſtatutes which ſupport idolatry, and for violating rites which are of human
                    invention; and that, if inſurrections and tumults ſhould diſturb the realm, from
                    the diverſity of religious opinions, and if abuſes ſhould be corrected by
                    violence, all the guilt, diſorder, and inconvenience thence ariſing, inſtead of
                    being applied to them, ſhould be aſcribed to thoſe ſolely who had refuſed a
                    timely redreſs of wrongs, and who had deſpiſed petitions preſented with the
                    humility of faithful ſubjects, and for the purpoſes of</p>
                <p>eſtabliſhing the commandments of God, and a moſt juſt and ſalutary
                    reformation.</p>
                <p>The three eſtates received this formidable proteſt with attention and reſpect;
                    but the intention of inſerting it in the national records was abandoned by the
                    Congregation, upon a formal promiſe from the queen-regent, that all the matters
                    in controverſy ſhould ſpeedily be brought by her to a fortunate iſſue.</p>
                <p>While the Proteſtants were thus making the moſt vigorous exertions in behalf of
                    their ſpiritual liberties, the queen-regent, in order to eſtabliſh herſelf the
                    more effectually, uſed every effort to promote the marriage of her daughter with
                    the dauphin of France. In 1557, commiſſioners were appointed to negociate this
                    marriage; but while theſe negociations were going on, the court of France acted
                    in the moſt perfidious manner. At the age of 15, after ſolemnly ratifying the
                        <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> independency of Scotland, and the ſucceſſion
                    of the crown in the houſe of Hamilton, queen Mary was influenced by the king and
                    her uncles the princes of Lorraine to ſign privately three extraordinary deeds
                    or inſtruments. By the firſt ſhe conveyed the kingdom of Scotland to the king of
                    France and his heirs, in the default of children of her own body. By the ſecond
                    ſhe aſſigned him, if ſhe ſhould die without children, the poſſeſſion of
                    Scotland, till he ſhould receive a million of pieces of gold, or be amply
                    recompenſed for the ſums expended by him in the education of the queen of
                    Scotland in France. By the third ſhe confirmed both theſe grants in an expreſs
                    declaration, that they contained the pure and genuine ſentiments of her mind;
                    and that any papers which might be obtained, either before or after her
                    marriage, by means of the Scottiſh parliament, ſhould be invalid, and of no
                    force nor efficacy. On the 24th of April, the nuptials were celebrated; and the
                    dauphin, Francis, was allowed to aſſume the title of king of Scotland. The
                    French court demanded for him the crown and other ensigns of royalty belonging
                    to Scotland; but the commiſſioners had no power to comply with their requeſt. It
                    was then deſired, that when they returned home, they ſhould uſe all their
                    influence to procure the crown-matrimonial of Scotland for the dauphin. This
                    alſo was refuſed; the court of France was diſguſted; and four of the
                    commiſſioners died, it was fuppoſed of poiſon, given them by the princes of
                    Lorraine. This ſubject, however, was preſſed, on the return of the ſurvivirrg
                    commiſſioners, by the king of France himſelf, the queen of Scotland, and the
                    queen- regent. The Proteſtants alſo joined their intereſt, hoping by that means
                    to gain over the queen and queen- regent to their party; ſo that an act of
                    parliament was at length paſſed, by which the crown-matrimonial was given to the
                    dauphin during the time of his marriage with queen Mary; but without any
                    prejudice to the liberties of the kingdom, to the heirs of her body, or to the
                    order of ſucceſſion. With ſo many reſtraints, it is difficult to ſee the
                    advantages which could accrue from this gift ſo earneſtly ſought after; and it
                    is very probable, that the uſurpations of France in conſequence of it, would
                    have been productive of many diſturbances; but theſe were prevented by the death
                    of Francis in December 1560.</p>
                <p>But beſore this event took place, Scotland was, by the intrigues of France,
                    involved in confuſion on another account. After the death of Mary queen of
                        Eng-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0038.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0032"/> land,
                    and daughter to Henry VIII. the princes of Guiſe infilled on the claim of Mary
                    queen of Scots to the crown of England, in preference to that of Elizabeth, whom
                    they looked upon as illegitimate. This claim was ſupported by the king of
                    France, who prevailed with the queen of Scots herſelf to aſſume the title of
                    queen of England, and to ſtamp money under that character. The arms of England
                    were quartered with thoſe of France and Scotland; and employed as ornaments for
                    the plate and furniture of Mary and the dauphin. Thus was laid the foundation of
                    an irreconcileable quarrel between Elizabeth and Mary; and to this, in ſome
                    meaſure, are we to aſcribe the in- veteracy with which the former persecuted the
                    unhappy queen of Scotland, at every time ſhe had it in her power.</p>
                <p>But while they imprudently excited a quarrel with England, they yet more
                    imprudently quarrelled alſo with the majority of the people of Scotland. As
                    Elizabeth profeſſed the Proteſtant religion, it was eaſily foreſeen, that the
                        <hi rend="italic">Congregation,</hi> or body of the reformed in Scotland,
                    would never conſent to act againſt her in favour of a Popiſh power; and as they
                    could not be gained, it was reſolved to deſtroy them at once, by putting to
                    death all their leaders. The queen-regent gave intimation of her deſign to
                    re-eſtabliſh Popery, by proclaiming a ſolemn obſervance of Eaſter, receiving the
                    ſacrament according to the Romiſh communion, herſelf, and commanding all her
                    houſehold to receive it in the ſame manner. She next expreſſed herſelf in a
                    contemptuous manner againſt the reformed, affirmed that they had inſulted the
                    royal dignity, and declared her intention of reſtoring it to its ancient luſtre.
                    The preachers of the Congregation were next cited to appear at Stirling, to
                    anſwer the charges which might be brought againſt them. Alexander earl of
                    Glencairn, and Sir Hugh Campbell of Loudon, were deputed to admoniſh her not to
                    perſecute the preachers, unleſs they had been obnoxious by circulating erroneous
                    doctrines, or diſturbing the peace of government. The queen-regent in a paſſion
                    told them, that the preachers ſhould all be baniſhed Scotland, though their
                    doctrines were as found as thoſe of St Paul. The deputies urged her former kind
                    behaviour and promiſes; but the queen-regent anſwered, that “the promiſes of
                    princes ought not to be exacted with rigour, and that they were binding only
                    when ſubſervient to their conveniency and pleaſure.” To this they replied, that
                    in ſuch a cafe they could not look upon her as their ſovereign, and mull
                    renounce their allegiance as ſubjects.</p>
                <p>Soon after this tranſaction, the queen-regent received the news that the
                    reformation was eſtabliſhed in Perth. Lord Ruthven the provoſt of the city was
                    ſummoned to anſwer for this innovation; but his reply was, that he had no
                    dominion over the minds and con- ſciences of men. The provoſt of Dundee, being
                    ordered to apprehend an eminent preacher, named <hi rend="italic">Paul
                        Methven,</hi> ſent him intelligence of the order, that he might provide for
                    his ſafety. The proclamation for obſerving Eaſter was everywhere deſpiſed and
                    neglected, and people exclaimed againſt the maſs as an idol. New citations, in
                    the mean time, had been given to the preachers to appear at Stirling. They
                    obeyed the ſummons; but attended by ſuch multitudes, that the queen-regent,
                    dreading their power, though they ware without arms, intreated Mr Erſkine of
                    Dun, whom they had ſent before as a deputy, to ſtop their march; aſſuring him
                    that all proceedings againſt the preachers ſhould be Hopped. In conſequence of
                    this, the multitude diſmiſſed; yet, when the day came on which the preachers
                    ſhould have appeared, the queen-regent, with unparalleled folly as well as
                    treachery, cauſed them to be declared traitors, and proclaimed it criminal to
                    afford them any ſubſiſtence.</p>
                <p>Mr Erſkine, exaſperated by this ſhameſul conduct, haſtened to the Congregation,
                    apologiſed for his conduct, and urged them to proceed to the laſt extremities.
                    At this critical period alſo John Knox returned from Geneva, and joined the
                    Congregation at Perth. The great provocations which the Proteſtants had already
                    received, joined to the impetuous paſſions of the multitude, were now productive
                    of the greateſt diſorders. Images were deſtroyed, monaſteries pulled down, and
                    their wealth either ſeized by the mob or given to the poor. The example of Perth
                    was followed by Cupar in Fife; and ſimilar inſurrections being apprehended in
                    other places, the queen-regeat determined to puniſh the inhabitants of Perth in
                    the moſt exemplary manner. With this view ſhe collected an army: but being
                    oppoſed with a formidable power by the Proteſtants, ſhe thought proper to
                    conclude an agreement. The Proteſtants, however, dreaded her inſincerity; and
                    therefore entered into a new covenant to ſtand by and defend one another. Their
                    fears were not vain. The queen-regent violated the treaty almoſt as ſoon as
                    made, and began to treat the Proteſtants with ſeverity. The earl of Argyle, and
                    the prior of St Andrew’s, who about this time began to take the title of <hi
                        rend="italic">lord James Stuart,</hi> now openly headed the Proteſtant
                    party, and prepared to collect their whole ſtrength. The queen- regent oppoſed
                    them with what forces ſhe had, and which indeed chiefly conſiſted of her French
                    auxiliaries; but, being again afraid of coming to an engagement, ſhe conſented
                    to a truce until commiſſioners ſhould be ſent to treat with the lords of an
                    effectual peace. No commiſſioners, however, were ſent on her part; and the
                    nobles, provoked at ſuch complicated and unceaſing treachery, reſolved to puſh
                    matters to the utmoſt extremity. The firſt exploit of the reformed was the
                    taking of the town of Perth, where the queen-regent had placed a French
                    garriſon. The multitude, elated with this atchievement, deſtroyed the palace and
                    abbey of Scone, in ſpite of all the endeavours of their leaders, even of John
                    Knox himſelf, to ſave them. The queen- regent, apprehenſive that the
                    Congregation would commit farther ravages to the ſouthward, reſolved to throw a
                    garriſon into Stirling; but the earl of Argyle and lord James Stuart were too
                    quick for her, and arrived there the very day after the demolition of the abbey
                    and palace of Scone. The people, incapable of reſtraint, and provoked beyond
                    meaſure by the perſidious behaviour of the Catholic party, demoliſhed all the
                    monaſteries in the neighbourhood, together with the fine abbey of Cambuſkenneth,
                    ſituated on the north bank of the Forth. From Stirling they went to Linlithgow,
                    where they committed their uſual ravages; after which, they advanced to
                    Edinburgh. The queen- regent, alarmed at their approach, fled to Dunbar; and the
                    Proteſtants took up their reſidence in Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>Having thus got poſſeſſion of the capital, the Con-<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0039.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0033"/> gregation
                    aſſumed to themſelves the ruling power of the kingdom, appointed preachers in
                    all the churches, and ſeized the mint, with all the inſtruments of coining. The
                    queen-regent, unable to diſpute the matter in the field, publiſhed a manifeſto,
                    in which ſhe ſet forth their ſeditious behaviour, commanding them to leave
                    Edinburgh within ſix hours, and enjoining her fubjects to avoid their ſociety
                    under the pain of treaſon. The Congregation having already loſt ſomewhat of
                    their popularity by their violent proceedings, were now incapable of coping with
                    government. As they had not eſtabliſhed themſelves in any regular body, or
                    provided a fund for their ſupport, they felt their ſtrength decay, and
                    multitudes of them returned to their habitations. Thoſe who remained found
                    themſelves obliged to vindicate their conduct; and, in an addreſs to the regent,
                    to diſclaim all treaſonable intentions. Negociations again took place, which
                    ended as uſual; the queen-regent, who had taken this opportunity of collecting
                    her forces, marched againſt the Congregation on the 23d of July 1559. The
                    Proteſtants now found themſelves incapable of making head againſt their enemies;
                    and therefore entered into a negociation, by which all differences were for the
                    preſent accommodated. The terms of this treaty were, that the town of Edinburgh
                    ſhould be open to the queen-dowager and her attendants; that the palace of
                    Holyroodhouſe and the mint ſhould be delivered up to her; that the Proteſtants
                    ſhould be ſubject to the laws, and abſtain from moleſting the Roman Catholics in
                    the exerciſe of their religion. On the queen’s part, it was agreed, that the
                    Proteſtants ſhould have the free exerciſe of their religion, and that no foreign
                    troops ſhould enter the city of Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>Notwithſtanding this treaty, however, the reformed had no confidence in the
                    queen’s ſincerity. Having heard of the death of Henry II. of France, and the
                    acceſſion of Francis II. and Mary to that kingdom, they ſeem to have apprehended
                    more danger than ever. They now entered into a third covenant; in which they
                    engaged themſelves to refuſe attendance to the queen- dowager, in caſe of any
                    meſſage or letter; and that immediately on the receipt of any notice from her to
                    any of their number, it ſhould be. communicated without reſerve, and be made a
                    common ſubject of ſcrutiny and deliberation. It was not long before they had
                    occaſion for all their conſtancy and ſtrength. The queen-regent repented of the
                    favourable terms ſhe had granted the reformed; and being denied the favour which
                    ſhe requeſted of ſaying maſs in the high-church of Edinburgh, ſhe ordered them
                    to be everywhere diſturbed in the exerciſe of their religion.</p>
                <p>In this imprudent meaſure, the queen-regent was confirmed by letters which now
                    came from Francis and Mary, promiſing a powerful army to ſupport her intereſts.
                    The envoy who brought theſe diſpatches alſo carried letters to the lord James
                    Stuart, now the principal leader of the Proteſtants, and natural brother to the
                    queen. The letters were filled with reproaches and menaces, mixed with
                    intreaties; and along with them the envoy delivered a verbal meſſage, that the
                    king his maller was reſolved rather to expend all the treaſures of France than
                    net to be revenged on the rebellious nobles who had diſturbed the peace of
                    Scotland. The lord James Stuart was not to be frightened by theſe mena</p>
                <p>ces, He returned a cool and deliberate anſwer, apologizing for the Proteſtants,
                    and vindicating them from the charge of rebellion; but at the fame time
                    intimating his full reſolution of continuing to head the reformed as he had
                    already done.</p>
                <p>The letters of Francis and Mary were ſoon followed by 1000 French ſoldiers, with
                    money and military flores; and the commander was immediately diſpatched again to
                    France, to ſolicit the aſſiſtance of as many more ſoldiers, with four ſhips of
                    war, and 100 men- at-arms. But before he could ſet out, La Broſſe, another
                    French commander, arrived with 2000 infantry; and that the Congregation might be
                    defeated not only by arms but in diſputation, the ſame ſhip brought three
                    doctors of the Sorbonne, to ſhow the pernicious tendency of the new doctrines.
                    Thus matters were puſhed on beyond all hopes of reconciliation. The nation was
                    univerſally alarmed on account of the introduction of French troops, to which
                    they ſaw no end. The queen-regent attemptcd to quiet the minds of the public by
                    a proclamation; but their fears increaſed the more. The Congregation aſſembled
                    at Stirling, where they were joined by the earl of Arran, and ſoon after by his
                    father the duke of Chatelherault. They next deliberated on the meaſures to be
                    followed with the queen-regent; and the reſult of their conſultations was, that
                    an expoſtulatory letter ſhould be addreſſed to her. This was accordingly done;
                    but as the queen behaved with her uſual duplicity, the nobles called the people
                    to arms. Mutual manifeſtos were now publiſhed; and both parties prepared to
                    decide the conteſt by the ſword. The Congregation having ſeized Broughty caſtle,
                    marched from thence to Edinburgh. The queen-regent retired to Leith, which ſhe
                    had fortified and filled with French troops. Thither the nobles ſent their laſt
                    meſſage to her, charging her with a deſign to overthrow the civil liberties of
                    the kingdom. They requeſted her to command her Frenchmen and mercenaries to
                    depart from Leith, and to make that place open and patent, not only to the
                    inhabitants who had been diſpoſſeſſed of their houſes, but to all the
                    inhabitants of Scotland. They declared, that her denial of this requeſt ſhould
                    be conſidered by them as a proof of her intention to reduce the kingdom to
                    ſlavery; in which caſe, they were determined to employ their utmoſt power to
                    preſerve its independency. Two days after this meſſage, the queen-regent ſent to
                    them the lord Lyon, whom ſhe enjoined to tell them, that ſhe conſidered their
                    demand not only as preſumptuous, but as an encroachment on the royal authority;
                    that it was an indignity to her to be dictated to by ſubjects; that Frenchmen
                    were not to be treated as foreigners, being entitled to the ſame privileges with
                    Scotſmen; and that ſhe would neither diſhand her troops, nor command the town of
                    Leith to be made open and patent. The lord Lyon then, in the name of the queen-
                    regent, commanded the lords of the Congregation to depart from Edinburgh, and
                    diſperſe themſelves, under the pain of high treaſon. The Proteſtants, irritated
                    by this anſwer, after ſome deliberation degraded the queen-regent; and to this
                    purpoſe the nobility, barons, and burgeſſes, all agreed in ſubſcribing an edict,
                    which was ſent to the principal cities in Scotland, and publiſhed in them.</p>
                <p>The next ſtep taken by the Congregation was to<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0040.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0034"/> ſummon Leith
                    to ſurrender; but meeting with defiance inſtead of ſubmiſſion, it was reſolved
                    to take the town by ſcalade. "For this ſervice ladders were framed in the church
                    of St Giles; a buſineſs which, interrupting the preachers in the exerciſe of
                    public worſhip, made them prognoſticate misfortune and miſearriage to the
                    Congregation. In the diſpleaſure of the preachers, the common people found a
                    ſource of complaint; and the emiſſaries of the queen-dowager acting with
                    indefatigable induſtry to divide her adverſaries, and to ſpread chagrin and
                    diſſatisfaction among them, diſcontent, animoſity, and terror, came to prevail
                    to a great degree. The duke of Chatelherault diſcouraged many by his example.
                    Defection from the Proteſtants added ſtrength to the queen-dowager. The moſt
                    ſecret deliberations of the confederated lords were revealed to her. The
                    ſoldiery were clamorous for pay; and it was very difficult, to procure money to
                    ſatisfy their claims. Attempts to ſoothe and appeaſe them, diſcovering their
                    conſequence, engendered mutinies. They put to death a domeſtic of the earl of
                    Argyle, who endeavoured to compoſe them to order: they inſulted ſeveral perſons
                    of rank who diſcovered a solicitude to pacify them; and they even ventured to
                    declare, that, for a proper reward, they were ready to ſuppreſs the reformation,
                    and to re-eſtabliſh the maſs.</p>
                <p>It was abſolutely neceſſary to give ſatisfaction to the Proteſtant ſoldiers. The
                    lords and gentlemen of the Congregation collected a conſiderable ſum among them;
                    but it was not equal to the preſent exigency. The avarice of many taught them to
                    withhold what they could afford, and the poverty of others did not permit them
                    to indulge their generoſity. It was reſolved, that each nobleman ſhould
                    ſurrender his ſilver- plate to be ſtruck into money. By the addreſs, however, of
                    the queen-dowager, the officers of the mint were bribed to conceal, or to convey
                    to a diſtance, the ſtamps and inſtruments of coinage. A gloomy deſpair gave
                    diſquiet to the Congregation, and threatened their ruin. Queen Elizabeth, with
                    whole miniſters the confederated lords maintained a correſpondence at this time,
                    had frequently promiſed them her aſſiſtance; but they could not now wait the
                    event of a deputation to the court of England. In an extremity ſo preſſing, they
                    therefore applied for a ſum of money to Sir Ralph Sadler and Sir James Croft,
                    the governors of Berwick; and Cockburn of Ormiſton, who was entruſted with this
                    commiſſion, obtaincd from them an aid of 4000 crowns. Traitors, however, in the
                    councils of the Congregation, having informed the queen-dowager of his errand
                    and expedition, the earl of Bothwel, by her order, intercepted him upon his
                    return, diſcomfited his retinue, and made a prize of the Engliſh ſubſidy.</p>
                <p>To rouſe the ſpirit of the party, an attack was projected upon Leith, and ſome
                    pieces of artillery were planted againſt it. But before any charge could be
                    made, the French ſoldiers ſallied out to give battle to the troops of the
                    Congregation, poſſeſſed themſelves of their cannon, and drove them back to
                    Edinburgh. A report that the victors had entered this city with the fugitives,
                    filled it with diſorder and diſmay. The earl, of Argyle and his Highlanders
                    haſtened to recover the honour of the day, and haraſſed the French in their
                    retreat. This petty conflict, while it elated the queen-dowager, ſerved to
                    augment the deſpondence of the Proteſtants.</p>
                <p>Vain of their proweſs, the French made a new ſally from Leith, with a view to
                    intercept a ſupply of proviſions and ſtores for the Congregation. The earl of
                    Arran and the lord James Stuart advanced to attack them, and obliged them to
                    retire. But purſuing them with too much heat, a freſh body of French troops made
                    its appearance. It was prudent to retreat, but difficult. An obſtinate
                    reſiſtance was made. It was the object of the French to cut off the ſoldiery of
                    the Congregation from Edinburgh, and by theſe means to divide the ſtrength of
                    that ſtation. The earl of Arran and the lord James Stuart had occaſion for all
                    their addreſs and courage. Though they were able, however, to effect their
                    eſcape, their loſs was conſiderable, and the victory was manifeſtly on the ſide
                    of their adverſaries.</p>
                <p>About this time "William Maitland of Lethington, ſecretary to the queen-dowager,
                    withdrew ſecretly from Leith, and joined himſelf to the confederated nobles. He
                    had been diſguſted with the jealouſies of the French counſellors, and was
                    expoſed to danger from having embraced the doctrines of the reformed. His
                    reception was cordial, and correſponded to the opinion entertained of his wiſdom
                    and experience. He was ſkilled in buſineſs, adorned with literature, and
                    accuſtomed to reflection. But as yet it was not known, that his want of
                    integrity was in proportion to the greatneſs of his talents.</p>
                <p>The acceſſion of this ſtateſman to their party could not conſole the lords of the
                    Congregation for the un- promiſing aſpect of their affairs. The two
                    diſcomfitures they had received ſunk deeply into the minds of their followers.
                    Thoſe who affected prudence, retired privately from a cauſe which they accounted
                    to be deſperate; and the timorous fled with precipitation. The wailings and
                    diſtruſt of the brethren were melancholy and infectious; and by exciting the
                    ridicule and ſcorn of the partiſans of the queen-dowager, were augmented the
                    more. A diſtreſs not to be comforted ſeemed to have invaded the Proteſtants; and
                    the aſſociated nobles conſented to abandon the capital. A little after midnight,
                    they retired from Edinburgh; and ſo great was the panic which prevailed, that
                    they marched to Stirling without any ſtop or intermiſſion.</p>
                <p>John Knox, who had accompanied the Congregation to Stirling, anxious to recover
                    their unanimity and courage, addreſſed them from the pulpit. He repreſented
                    their misfortunes as the conſequences of their ſins; and intreating them to
                    remember the goodneſs of their cauſe, aſſured them in the end of joy, honour,
                    and victory. His popular eloquence correſponding to all their warmeſt wiſhes,
                    diffuſed ſatisfaction and cheerfulneſs. They paſſed from deſpair to hope. A
                    council was held, in which the confederated nobles determined to ſolicit, by a
                    formal embaſſy, the aid of queen Elizabeth. Maitland of Lethington, and Robert
                    Melvil, were choſen to negociate this important tranſaction; and they received
                    the fulleſt inſtructions concerning the ſtate and difficulties of the
                    Congregation, the tyrannical deſigns of the queen-dowager, and the danger which
                    threatened England from the union of Scotland with France.</p>
                <p>The queen of England having maturely conſidered<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0041.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0035"/> the caſe,
                    determined to aſſiſt the reformers; whoſe leaders now diſperſed themſelves, and
                    went to different parts of the kingdom, in order to employ their activity there
                    for the common cauſe. The queen-dowager, imagining that the lords were fled,
                    conceived great hopes of being able to cruſh the reformed at once. Her ſanguine
                    hopes, however, were ſoon checked, on receiving certain intelligence that queen
                    Elizabeth was reſolved to give them aſſiſtance. She now took the beſt meaſures
                    poſſible, as circumſtances ſtood; and determined to cruſh her enemies before
                    they could receive any aſſiſtance from England. Her French troops took the road
                    to Stirling, and waſted in their march all the grounds which belonged to the
                    favourers of the reformation. After renewing their depredations at Stirling,
                    they paſſed the bridge there; and proceeding along the ſide of the river,
                    exerciſed their cruelties and oppreſſions in a diſtrict which had diſtinguiſhed
                    itſelf by an ardent zeal againſt popery. While the terror of their arms was thus
                    diffuſing itſelf, they reſolved to ſeize the town and caſtle of St Andrew’s,
                    which they conſidered as an important military ſtation, and as a convenient
                    place of reception for the auxiliaries they expected from France.</p>
                <p>But the lord James Stuart employed himſelf to interrupt their progreſs and retard
                    their attempts; and it was his object at the ſame time, to keep the force of the
                    Congregation entire, to hazard no action of importance, and to wait the approach
                    of the Engliſh army. A ſmall advantage was obtained by the French at Petticur;
                    and they poſſeſſed themſelves of Kinghorn. The lord James Stuart, with 500 horſe
                    and 100 foot, entered Dyſart. With this inconſiderable ſtrength he propoſed to
                    act againſt an army of 4000 men. His admirable ſkill in military affairs, and
                    his heroic courage, were eminently diſplayed. During 20 days he prevented the
                    march of the French to St Andrew’s, intercepting their proviſions, haraſſing
                    them with ſkirmiſhes, and intimidating them by the addreſs and the boldneſs of
                    his ſtratagems.</p>
                <p>Monſieur d’Oyſel, enraged and aſhamed to be diſconcerted and oppoſed by a body of
                    men ſo diſproportioned to his army, exerted himſelf with vigour. The lord James
                    Stuart was obliged to retire. Dyſart and Wemyſs were given to the French troops
                    to be pillaged; and when d’Oyſel was in full march to St Andrew’s, he diſcovered
                    a powerful fleet bearing up the frith. It was concluded, that the ſupplies
                    expected from France were arrived. Guns were fired by his ſoldiers, and their
                    joy was indulged in all its extravagance. But this fleet having taken the
                    veſſels which contained their proviſions, and the ordnance with which they
                    intended to improve the fortifications of the caſtle at St Andrew’s, a period
                    was put to their rejoicings. Certain news was brought, that the fleet they
                    obſerved was the navy of England, which had come to ſupport the Congregation. A
                    conſternation, heightened by the giddineſs of their preceding tranſports,
                    invaded them. Monſieur d’Oyſel perceived now the value and merit of the ſervice
                    which had been performed by the lord James Stuart; and thinking no more of St
                    Andrew’s and conqueſt, fled, to Stirling, in his way to Leith, from which he
                    dreaded to be intercepted; but he reached that important ſtation after a march
                    of three days.</p>
                <p>A formal treaty was now concluded between the lords of the Congregation and queen
                    Elizabeth; and in the mean time the queen-dowager was diſappointed in her
                    expectations from France. The violent adminiſtration of the houſe of Guiſe had
                    involved that nation in troubles and diſtreſs. Its credit was greatly ſunk, and
                    its treaſury was nearly exhauſted. Perſecutions, and the ſpirit of Calviniſm,
                    produced commotions and conſpiracies; and amidſt domeſtic and dangerous
                    intrigues and ſtruggles, Scotland failed to engage that particular diſtinction
                    which had been promiſed to its affairs. It was not, however, neglected
                    altogether. The count De Martigues had arrived at Leith with 1000 foot and a few
                    horſe. The marquis D’Elbeuf had embarked for it with another body of ſoldiers;
                    but, after loſing ſeveral ſhips in a furious tempeſt, was obliged to return to
                    the haven from which he had ſailed.</p>
                <p>In this ſad reverſe of fortune many forſook the queen- dowager. It was now
                    underſtood that the Engliſh army was upon its march to Scotland. The Scottiſh
                    lords who had affected a neutrality, meditated an union with the Proteſtants.
                    The earl of Huntley gave a ſolemn aſſurance that he would join them.
                    Proclamations were iſſued throughout the kingdom, calling upon the ſubjects of
                    Scotland to aſſemble in arms at Linlithgow, to re-eſtabliſh their ancient
                    freedom, and to aſſiſt in the utter expulſion of the French ſoldiery.</p>
                <p>The Engliſh fleet, meanwhile, under Winter the vice-admiral, had taken and
                    deſtroyed ſeveral ſhips, had landed ſome troops upon Inchkeith, and diſcomſited
                    a body of French mercenaries. Upon the foundation of theſe acts of hoſtility,
                    the princes of Lorraine diſpatched the chevalier de Seure to queen Elizabeth, to
                    make repreſentations againſt this breach of the peace, and to urge the recal of
                    her ſhips. This ambaſſador affected likewiſe to negociate concerning the
                    evacuation of Scotland by the French troops, and to propoſe methods by which the
                    king of France might quarter the arms of England without doing a prejudice to
                    queen Elizabeth. But to prevent the execution of vigorous reſolutions againſt
                    the queen-dowager, and to gain time, were the only objects he had in view. With
                    ſimiliar intentions, John Monluc biſhop of Valence, a man of greater addreſs and
                    ability, and equally devoted to the houſe of Guiſe, was alſo ſent at this time
                    to the court of England. Queen Elizabeth, however, and her miniſters, were too
                    wiſe to be amuſed by artifice and dexterity. The lord Grey entered Scotland with
                    an army of 1200 horſe and 6000 foot; and the lord Scroop, Sir James Croft, Sir
                    Henry Percy, and Sir Francis Lake commanded under him. By an inclement policy,
                    the queen- dowager had already wafted all the country around the capital. But
                    the deſolation ſhe had made, while it was ruinous to the Scottiſh peaſants,
                    affected not the army of England. The leaders of the Congregation did not want
                    penetration and foreſight, and had provided themſelves againſt this difficulty.
                    The duke of Chatelherault, the earls of Argyle, Glencairn, and Menteith, the
                    lord James Stuart, and the lords Ruthven, Boyd, and Ochiltree, with a numerous
                    and formidable force, joined the Engliſh commander at Preſton.</p>
                <p>Struck with the ſad condition of her affairs, deſpairing of a timely and proper
                    ſuccour from France, and reminded by ſickneſs of her mortality, the
                        queen-dowager<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0042.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0036"/> retired from Leith to the caſtle of Edinburgh,
                    and put herſelf under the protection of the lord Erſkine. At the period when ſhe
                    was appointed to the regency, the lord Erſkine had received from the three
                    eſtates the charge of this important fortreſs, with the injunction to hold it
                    till he ſhould know their farther orders; and giving way to the ſolicitations of
                    neither faction, he had kept it with fidelity. By admitting the queen- dowager,
                    he yielded to ſentiments of honour and humanity, and did not mean to depart from
                    his duty. A few only of her domeſtics accompanied her, with the archbiſhop of St
                    Andrew’s, the biſhop of Dunkeld, and the earl Mariſchal.</p>
                <p>The confederated nobles now aſſembled at Dalkeith to hold a council; and
                    conforming to thoſe maxims of prudence and equity which, upon the eve of
                    hoſtilities, had been formerly exerciſed by them, they invited the queen-dowager
                    to an amicable concluſion of the preſent troubles. In a letter which they wrote
                    to her, they called to her remembrance the frequent maniſeſtos and meſſages in
                    which they had preſſed her to diſmiſs the French ſoldiery, who had ſo long
                    oppreſſed the lower ranks of the people, and who threatened to reduce the
                    kingdom itſelf to ſervitude. The averſion, however, with which ſhe had
                    conſtantly received their ſuit and prayers, was ſo great, that they had given
                    way to a ſtrong neceſſity, and had intreated the aſſiſtance of the queen of
                    England to expel theſe ſtrangers by the force of arms. But though they had
                    obtained the powerful protection of this princeſs, they were yet animated with a
                    becoming reſpect for the mother of their ſovereign; and, abhorring to ſtain the
                    ground with Chriſtian blood, were diſpoſed once more to ſolicit the diſmiſſion
                    of theſe mercenaries, with their officers and captains. And that no juſt
                    objection might remain againſt the grant of this their laſt requeſt, they
                    aſſured her, that a ſafe paſſage by land, to the ports of England, ſhould be
                    allowed to the French; or that, if they judged it more agreeable, the navy of
                    queen Elizabeth ſhould tranſport them to their own country. If theſe propoſals
                    ſhould be rejected, they appealed and proteſted to God and to mankind, that it
                    ſhould be underſtood and believed, that no motive of malice, or hatred, or
                    wickedneſs of any kind, had induced them to employ the fatal expedient of arms
                    and battles; but that they had been compelled to this diſagreeable and
                    diſtreſsful remedy, for the preſervation of their commonwealth, their religion,
                    their perſons, their eſtates, and their poſterity. They begged her to weigh the
                    equity of their petition, to conſider the inconveniences of war, and to think of
                    the reſt and quiet which were neceſſary to relieve the afflictions of her
                    daughter’s kingdom; and they beſought her to embalm her own memory, by an
                    immortal deed of wiſdom, humanity, and juſtice.</p>
                <p>To give authority and weight to the letter of the aſſociated lords, the lord Grey
                    directed Sir George Howard and Sir James Croft to wait upon the queen- dowager,
                    and to ſtipulate the peaceable departure of the Engliſh troops, upon the
                    condition that the French mercenaries were immediately diſmiſſed from her
                    ſervice, and prohibited from reſiding in Scotland. Returning no direct anſwer to
                    the applications made to her, ſhe deſired time to deliberate upon the reſolution
                    which it became her to adopt. This equivocal behaviour correſponded with the
                    ſpirit of intrigue which had uniformly diſtinguiſhed the queen-dowager; and it
                    is probable, that her engagements with France did not permit her to be open and
                    explicit.</p>
                <p>The combined armies marched towards Leith. A body of the French, poſted upon a
                    riſing ground called <hi rend="italic">Hawk-hill,</hi> diſputed their progreſs.
                    During five hours the conflict was maintained with obſtinate valour. At length
                    the Scottiſh horſemen charged the French with a fury which they were unable to
                    refill. They fled to Leith with precipitation; and might have been cut off from
                    it altogether, if the Engliſh cavalry had exerted themſelves. Three hundred of
                    the French ſoldiers periſhed in this action, and a few combatants only fell on
                    the ſide of the Congregation.</p>
                <p>Leith was inverted. The pavilions and tents of the Engliſh and Scottiſh nobility
                    were planted at Reſtalrig, and around it. Trenches were call; and the ordnance
                    from the town annoying the combined armies, a mount was raiſed, upon which eight
                    cannons were erected. A continued fire from theſe, againſt St Anthony’s tower in
                    South Leith, being kept up and managed with ſkill, the walls of this fabric were
                    ſhaken, and the French found it neceſſary to diſmount their artillery.—
                    Negligent from ſecurity, and apprehenſive of no attack, the Engliſh and Scottiſh
                    officers occupied themſelves in amuſements, and permitted a relaxation of
                    military diſcipline. The French, informed of this ſupineneſs and levity, made a
                    ſally from Leith, While ſome of the captains were diverting themſelves at
                    Edinburgh, and the ſoldiery were engaged at dice and cards, they entered the
                    trenches unobſerved, and, puſhing their advantage, put 600 men to the ſword.
                    After this ſiaughter, the Proteſtants were more attentive to their affairs.—
                    Mounts were built at proper diſtances, which, being fortified with ordnance,
                    ſerved as places of retreat and defence in the event of ſudden incurſions; and
                    thus they continued the blockade in a more effectual manner.</p>
                <p>The army under the marquis D’Elbeuf, promiſed ſo often to the queen-regent, was
                    in vain expected by her; but ſhe received, at this time, ſupplies in money and
                    military ſtores; and Monluc biſhop of Valence, though defeated in dexterity by
                    Elizabeth and her miniſters, had arrived in Scotland to try anew the arts of
                    delay and negociation. Conferences were held by him with the queen-dowager, with
                    the Engliſh commanders, and with the confederated nobles; but no contract or
                    agreement could be concluded. His credentials neither extended to the demolition
                    of Leith, nor to the recal of the French mercenaries: and though he obtained
                    powers from his court to conſent to the former of theſe meaſures, they were yet
                    burdened with conditions which were diſgraceful to the Congregation; who, in the
                    preſent proſperous ſtate of their fortunes, were not diſpoſed to give up any of
                    the objects for which they had ſtruggled ſo long, and to the attainment of which
                    they now looked forward with a ſettled hope and expectation.</p>
                <p>Though the grave and meaſured orations of Monlue could not overpower the plain
                    and ſtubborn ſenſe of the Congregation, yet as he affected to give them
                    admonitions and warnings, and even ventured to inſult them with menaces, they
                    appear to have conceived a high indignation againſt him. Under this impulſe,
                        and<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0043.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0037"/> that
                    in ſo advanced a ſtage of their affairs, they might exhibit the determined
                    firmneſs of their reſolutions, and bind to them by an indiſſoluble tie the earl
                    of Huntley and the other perſons who had joined them in conſequence of the
                    Engliſh alliance, they thought of the aſſurance and ſtability of a <hi
                        rend="italic">new league and covenant,</hi> more ſolemn, expreſſive, and
                    reſolute, than any which they had yet entered into and ſubſcribed.</p>
                <p>The nobles, barons, and inferior perſons, who were parties to this bond and
                    aſſociation, bound themſelves in the preſence of Almighty God, as a ſociety, and
                    as individuals, to advance and ſet forward the reformation of religion, and to
                    procure, by every poſſible means, the true preaching of the goſpel, with the
                    proper adminiſtration of the ſacraments, and the other ordinances in connection
                    with it. Deeply affected, at the ſame time, with the miſconduct of the French
                    ſtateſmen, who had been promoted to high offices; with the oppreſſions of the
                    French mercenaries, whom the queen- dowager kept up and maintained under the
                    colour of authority; with the tyranny of their captains; and with the manifeſt
                    danger of conqueſt to which the country was expoſed, by different fortifications
                    upon the ſea-coaſt, and by other dangerous innovations; they promiſed and
                    engaged, generally and individually, to join with the queen of England’s army,
                    and to concur in an honeſt, plain, and unreſerved reſolution to expel all
                    foreigners from the realm, as oppreſſors of public liberty; that, by recovering
                    the ancient rights, privileges, and freedom of their nation, they might live for
                    the future under the due obedience of their king and queen, be ruled by the laws
                    and cuſtoms of the country, and by officers and ſtateſmen born and educated
                    among them. It was likewiſe contracted and agreed by</p>
                <p>the ſubſcribers to this bond and covenant, that no private intelligence by
                    writing or meſſage, or communication of any kind, ſhould be kept up with their
                    adverſaries; and that all perſons who reſiſted the godly enterprise in which
                    they were united, ſhould be regarded as their enemies, and reduced to ſubjection
                    and obedience.</p>
                <p>When the ſtrong and fervid ſentiment and expreſſion of this new aſſociation were
                    communicated to the queen-dowager, ſhe reſigned herſelf to ſorrow. Her mind,
                    inclined to deſpondence by the increaſe of her malady, felt the more intenſely
                    the cruel diffractions and diſquiets into which the kingdom had been driven by
                    the ambition of France, her own doating affection for the princes of Lorraine,
                    and the vain prognoſtſeations of flatterers and courtiers. In the agony of
                    paſſion, ſhe beſought the malediction and curſe of God to alight upon all thoſe
                    who had counſelled her to perſecute the preachers, and to refuſe the petitions
                    of the moſt honourable portion of her ſubjects.</p>
                <p>In the mean time the ſiege of Leith was proſecuted. But the ſtrength of the
                    garriſon amounting to more than 4000 ſoldiers, the operations of the beſiegers
                    were flow and languid. An accidental fire in the town, which deſtroyed many
                    houſes and a great part of the public granary, afforded them an opportunity of
                    playing their artillery with ſome advantage; and a few days aſter they made a
                    general aſſault. But the ſcaling- ladders which were applied to the walls being
                    too ſhort, and Sir James Croft, who had been gained to the queen- dowager,
                    having acted a treacherous part, the attempt</p>
                <p>failed of ſucceſs, and 1000 men were deſtroyed. The combined armies, however, did
                    not loſe their reſolution or their hopes. The Engliſh and Scots animated the
                    conſtancy of one another; and in the ratification of the treaty of Berwick,
                    which was now made, a new ſource of cordiality opened itſelf. Letters alſo had
                    come from the duke of Norfolk, promiſing a powerful reinforcement, giving the
                    expectation of his taking upon him the command of the troops in perſon, and
                    ordering his pavilion to be erected in the camp. Leith began to feel the miſery
                    of famine, and the French to give themſelves to deſpair. The beſiegers abounded
                    in every thing; and the arrival of 2000 men, the expected reinforcement from
                    England, gave them the moſt deciſive ſuperiorſty over their adverſaries.
                    Frequent ſallies were made by the garriſon, and they were always unſucceſsful.
                    Diſcouraged by defeats, depreſſed with the want of proviſions, and languiſhing
                    under the negligence of France, they were ready to ſubmit themſelves to the
                    mercy of the Congregation.</p>
                <p>Amidſt this diſtreſs the queen-dowager, wafted with a lingering diſtemper and
                    with grief, expired in the caſtle of Edinburgh. A few days before her death, ſhe
                    invited to her the duke of Chatelherault, the lord James Stuart, and the earls
                    of Argyle, Glencairn, and Mariſchal, to bid them a laſt adieu. She expreſſed to
                    them her ſorrow for the troubles of Scotland, and made it her earneſt ſuit, that
                    they would conſult their conſtitutional liberties, by diſmiſſing the French and
                    Engliſh from their country; and that they would preſerve a dutiful obedience to
                    the queen their ſovereign. She profeſſed an unlimited forgiveneſs of all the
                    injuries which had been done to her; and entreated their pardon for the offences
                    ſhe had committed againſt them. In token of her kindneſs and charity, ſhe then
                    embraced them by turns; and, while the tear ſtarted in her eye, preſented to
                    them a cheerful and ſmiling aſpect. After this interview, the ſhort portion of
                    life which remained to her was dedicated to religion; and that ſhe might allure
                    the Congregation to be compaſſionate to her Popiſh ſubjects and her French
                    adherents, ſhe flattered them, by calling John Willocks, one of the moſt popular
                    of their preachers, to aſſiſt and comfort her by his exhortations and prayers.
                    He made long diſcourſes to her about the abominations of the maſs; but ſhe
                    appears to have died in the communion of the Romiſh church; and her body being
                    tranſported to France, was depoſited in the monaſtery of St Peter, at Rheims, in
                    Champagne, where her sister Renée was an abbeſs.</p>
                <p>The death of the queen-dowager, at a period ſo critical, broke altogether the
                    ſpirit of the French troops. They were blocked up ſo completely, that it was
                    almoſt impoſſible for any ſupplies to reach them either by ſea or land; and
                    France had delayed ſo long to fulfil its magnificent promiſes, that it was no
                    longer in a capacity to take any ſteps towards their accompliſhment. Its
                    internal diſtreſs and diſquiets were multiplying. The nobility, impoveriſhed by
                    wars, were courting the rewards of ſervice, and ſtruggling in hoſtility. The
                    clergy were avaricious, ignorant, and vindictive. The populace, knowing no trade
                    but arms, offered their ſwords to the factious. Francis II. the huſhand of Mary,
                    was. without dignity or underſtanding. Catharine de Medicis his mother was full
                    of artifice and falſehood. Inſurrections were dreaded in every pro-<pb

                    houſe of Guiſe was encompaſſed with difficulties, and trembling with
                    apprehenſions, ſo that they could not think of perſiſting in their views of
                    diſtant conqueſts. It was neceſſary that they ſhould abandon for a time all the
                    proud projects they had formed for the extenſion of the French monarchy. It was
                    chiefly in the exemption from foreign wars that they could hope to ſupport their
                    own greatneſs, and apply a remedy to the domeſtic diſturbances of France.</p>
                <p>It appeared to Francis and Mary, that they could not treat in a direct method
                    with the Congregation, whom they affected to conſider as rebellious ſubjects,
                    without derogating from their royal dignity. In negociating a peace, they
                    therefore addreſſed themſelves to queen Elizabeth. It was by her offices and
                    interference that they projected a reconciliation with the confederated lords,
                    and that they meant to extinguiſh the animoſities which, with ſo much violence,
                    had agitated the Scottiſh nation. They granted their commiſſion to John Monluc
                    biſhop of Valence, Nicholas Pelleve biſhop of Amiens, Jacques de la Broſſe,
                    Henry Clentin ſieur d’Oyſel, and Charles de la Rochefaucault ſieur de Randan;
                    authoriſing them in a body, or by two of their number, to enter into accords and
                    agreements with the queen of England. The Engliſh commiſſioners were Sir William
                    Cecil principal ſecretary of ſtate, Nicolas Wotton dean of Canterbury and York,
                    Sir Ralph Sadler, Sir Henry Percy, and Sir Peter Crew; and the powers of treaty
                    were to be exerciſed by them all in conjunction, or by four, three, or two of
                    them.</p>
                <p>The plenipotentiaries of France, though empowered only to treat with England,
                    were yet, by a ſeparate commiſſion, entruſted to aſſure the Congregation, that,
                    notwithſtanding the heinous guilt incurred by them, Francis and Mary were
                    inclined to receive them into favour, upon their repentance and return to
                    obedience; and to abſtain for ever from all inquiry into their conduct. They had
                    full authority, at the ſame time, by this new deed, to hear, in conjunction with
                    the commiſſioners of Elizabeth, the complaints of the Congregation, and to
                    grant, with their conſent, the relief which appeared to them to be the moſt
                    proper and ſalutary.</p>
                <p>The nobility and people of Scotland, chooſing for their repreſentatives the lord
                    James Stuart, the lord Ruthven, and Maitland of Lethington, expreſſed their
                    willingneſs to concur in reaſonable meaſures for the re- eſtabliſhment of the
                    public union and tranquillity. By the mode of a formal petition, they enumerated
                    their grievances, laid claim to a redreſs of them, and beſought an uniform
                    protection to their conſtitution and laws. To this petition the interceſſion of
                    queen Elizabeth effected the friendly attention of Francis and Mary; and upon a
                    foundation concerted with ſo much propriety, Monluc and Randan, Cecil and
                    Wotton, the acting plenipotentiaries of England and France, drew up and
                    authenticated the celebrated deed of relief and conceſſion which does ſo much
                    honour to the ſpirit, perſeverance, and magnanimity of the Scottiſh nation.</p>
                <p>By this accord and agreement, Francis and Mary ſtipulated and conſented, that no
                    French ſoldiers and no foreign troops ſhould ever be introduced into Scotland
                    without the counſel and advice of the three eſtates. They concurred in the
                    opinion, that the French mercenaries ſhould be ſent back into France, and that
                    the</p>
                <p>fortifications of Leith ſhould be demoliſhed. They agreed that commiſſioners
                    ſhould be appointed to vint Dunbar, and to point out the works there which ought
                    to be deſtroyed; and they bound and engaged themſelves to build no new fortreſs
                    or place of ſtrength within the kingdom, and to repair no old one, without a
                    parliamentary authority and fonction. They conſented to extinguiſh all debts
                    which had been contracted for the maintenance of the French and Scotch ſoldiery
                    in their ſervice. They appointed the eſtates of the realm to hold a parliament
                    for the diſcuſſion of affairs of ſtate; and they obliged themſelves to conſider
                    the acts of this aſſembly as valid and effectual in every reſpect. They
                    confirmed the ancient law of the country, which prohibited the princes of
                    Scotland from making peace and war without the advice of the three eſtates. It
                    was accorded and agreed by them, that the three eſtates, in concurrence with the
                    queen, ſhould elect a council for the adminiſtration of affairs during her
                    majeſty’s abſence. They became bound to employ the natives of Scotland in the
                    management of juſtice both civil and criminal, in the offices of chancellor,
                    keeper of the ſeals, treaſurer, comptroller, and in other ſtations of a ſimilar
                    nature; and to abſtain from the promotion of all foreigners to places of truſt
                    and honour, and from inveſting any clergyman in the charge of affairs of the
                    revenue. They determined to eſtabliſh an act of oblivion, and to forget and bury
                    for ever the memory of all the late tranſactions of war and offence. It was
                    concluded by them, that a general peace and reconciliation ſhould take place
                    among all parties. They expreſſed their determination, that no pretence ſhould
                    be aſſumed by them, from the late contentions, to deprive any of their ſubjects
                    of their eſtates or offices. And they referred the reparation which might be
                    proper to compeniate the injuries that had been ſuſtained by biſhops and
                    eccleſiaſtics, to the judgment of the three eſtates in parliament.</p>
                <p>Upon the ſubject of the reformation, the plenipotentiaries of England and France
                    did not chooſe to deliberate and decide, although articles with regard to it had
                    been preſented to them by the nobles and the people. They referred this delicate
                    topic to the enſuing meeting of the parliament; and the leaders of the
                    Congregation engaged, that deputies from the three eſtates ſhould repair to the
                    king and queen, to know their intention concerning matters of ſuch high
                    importance.</p>
                <p>After having granted theſe conceſſions to the nobility and the people of
                    Scotland, upon the part of their reſpective courts, Monluc and Randan, Cecil and
                    Wotton, concluded another deed of treaty and agreement. By this convention it
                    was determined, that the Engliſh and French troops ſhould depart out of
                    Scotland; that all warlike preparations ſhould ceaſe ; that the fort of Eymouth
                    ſhould be razed to the ground, in terms of∣ the treaty of Cambray; that Francis
                    and Mary ſhould abſtain from bearing the title and arms of England or Ireland;
                    that it ſhould be conſidered, whether a farther compenlation ſhould be made to
                    Elizabeth for the injuries committed againſt her; and that the king and queen of
                    Scots ſhould be fully and ſincerely reconciled to the nobility and the people of
                    their kingdom. The intereſts of England and France were the particular objects
                    of this agreement. But though the conceſſions to the Proteſtants were not
                    inſerted in it at full length, an<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0045.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0039"/> expreſſive reference was made to them; and they
                    received a confirmation in terms which could not be miſunderſtood or
                    controverted. This deed recorded the clemency of Francis and Mary to their
                    ſubjects of Scotland, the extreme willingneſs of the nobility and the people to
                    return to their duty and allegiance, the repreſentation they had offered of
                    their grievances, and the requeſt of queen Elizabeth that redreſs ſhould be
                    afforded to them; and it appealed to the conſequent conceſſions which had been
                    ſtipulated to their advantage.</p>
                <p>By theſe important negociations, the Proteſtants, while they humbled France,
                    flattered queen Elizabeth; and while they acquired a power to act in the
                    eſtabliſhment of the reformation, reſtored its civil conſtitution to Scotland.
                    The excluſion of foreigners from offices of ſtate, the limitation of the
                    Scottiſh princes with regard to peace and war, the advancement of the three
                    eſtates to their ancient conſequence, and the act of oblivion of all offences,
                    were acquiſitions moſt extenſively great and uſeful; and, while they gave the
                    fulleſt ſecurity to the reformed, gratified their moſt ſanguine
                    expectations.</p>
                <p>The peace, ſo fortunately concluded, was immediately proclaimed. The French
                    mercenaries embarked for their own country, and the Engliſh army took the road
                    to Berwick. Amidſt events ſo joyful, the preachers exhorted the confederated
                    nobles to command the ſolemnity of a thankſgiving. It was ordered accordingly;
                    and after its celebration, the commiſſioners of the boroughs, with ſeveral of
                    the nobility, and the tenants <hi rend="italic">in capite,</hi> were appointed
                    to chooſe and depute miniſters to preach the goſpel in the principal towns
                    throughout the kingdom. John Knox was called to diſcharge the paſtoral functions
                    at Edinburgh, Chriſtopher Goodman at St Andrew’s, Adam Heriot at Aberdeen, John
                    Row at Perth, Paul Methven at Jedburgh, William Chriſtiſon at Dundee, David
                    Ferguſon at Dunfermline, and David Lindſey at Leith. That the buſineſs of the
                    church, at the ſame time, might be managed with propriety, ſuperintendants were
                    elected to preſide over the eccleſiaſtical affairs of particular provinces and
                    diſtricts. Mr John Spotſwood was named the ſuperintendant for the diviſion of
                    Lothian, Mr John Willocks for that of Glaſgow, Mr John Winram for that of File,
                    Mr John Erſkine of Dun for that of Angus and Merns, and Mr John Carſewell for
                    that of Argyle and the Iſles. This inconſiderable number of miniſters and
                    ſuperintendants gave a beginning to the reformed church of Scotland.</p>
                <p>Amidſt the triumph and exultation of the Proteſtants, the meeting of the
                    parliament approached. All perſons who had a title from law, or from ancient
                    cuſtom, to attend the great council of the nation, were called to aſſemble
                    there. While there was a full convention of the greater barons and the prelates,
                    the inferior tenants <hi rend="italic">in capite,</hi> or the, leſſer barons,
                    upon an occaſion ſo great, inſtead of appearing by repreſentation, came in
                    crowds to give perſonally their aſſiſtance and votes; and all the commiſſioners
                    for the boroughs, without exception, preſented themſelves.</p>
                <p>It was objected to this parliament when it was aſſembled, that it could not be
                    valid, ſince Francis and Mary were not preſent, and had not empowered any perſon
                    to repreſent them. But by the terms of the late conceſſions to the nobility and
                    the people, they had in effect diſpeuſed with this formality; and the objection,
                    after having been agitated with heat for ſome days, was rejected by a majority
                    of voices. The lords of the articles were then choſen; and as the Proteſtant
                    party were ſuperior to the Popiſh faction, they were careful, in electing the
                    members of this committee, to favour all thoſe who were diſpoſed to forward the
                    work of the reformation. The firſt object which, the lords of the articles held
                    out to the parliament was the ſupplication of the nobility, gentry, and all the
                    other perſons who profeſſed the new doctrines. It required, that the Romiſh
                    church ſhould be condemned and aboliſhed. It reprobated the tenet of
                    tranſubſtantiation, the merit of works, papiſtical indulgences, purgatory,
                    pilgrimages, and prayers to departed ſaints; and conſidering them as peſtilent
                    errors, and as fatal to ſalvation, it demanded; that all thoſe who ſhould teach
                    and maintain them ſhould be expoſed to correction and puniſhment. It demanded,
                    that a remedy ſhould be applied againſt the profanation of the holy ſacraments
                    by the Roman. Catholics, and that the ancient diſcipline of the church ſhould be
                    reſtored. In fine, it infiſted, that the ſupremacy and authority of the pope
                    ſhould be aboliſhed; and that the patrimony of the church ſhould be employed in
                    ſupporting the reformed miniſtry, in the proviſion of ſchools, and in the
                    maintenance of the poor.</p>
                <p>This ſupplication of the Proteſtants was received in parliament with marks of the
                    greateſt deference and reſpect. The popiſh doctrines it cenſured, and the ſtrong
                    language it employed, excited no diſpute or altercation. The nobility, however,
                    and the lay members, did not think it expedient that the patrimony of the
                    church, in all its extent, ſhould be allotted to the reformed miniſtry, and the
                    ſupport of ſchools and the poor. Avoiding, therefore, any explicit ſcrutiny into
                    this point, the parliament gave it in charge to the miniſters and the leading
                    men of the reformation, to draw up, under diſtinct heads, the ſubſtance and
                    ſenſe of thoſe doctrines which ought to be eſtabliſhed over the kingdom. Within
                    four days this important buſineſs was accompliſhed. The writing or inſtrument to
                    which the reformed committed their opinions was termed, “The Confeſſion of
                    Faith, proſeſſed. and believed, by the Proteſtants within the realm of
                        Scotland<note anchored="true" n="4" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>(Q)
                            It is given at full length in KNox, in the collection of confessions of
                            faith, vol. 2. and in the statute book, parl. 1567.</p></note> (Q).” It
                    was read firſt to the lords of the articles. It was then read to the parliament;
                    and the prelates of the Romiſh church werc commanded, in the name of God, to
                    make publicly their objections to the doctrines it propoſed. They preſerved a
                    profound ſilence. A new diet was appointed for concluding the tranſaction. The
                    articles of the Confeſſion were again read over in their order, and the votes of
                    the parliament were called. Of the temporal nobility, three only refuſed to
                    beſtow upon it their authority. The earl of Athol, and the lords Somerville and
                    Bothwell, proteſt-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0046.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0040"/> ed, that ""they would believe as their fathers
                    had done before them.” The biſhops and the eſtate ecclesiaſtical, from a
                    conſciouſneſs of the weakneſs of popery, ſeemed to have lost all power of
                    ſpeech. No diſſent, no vote, was given by them. “It is long (ſaid the earl
                    Mariſchal), ſince I entertained a jealouſy of the Romiſh faith, and an affection
                    to the reformed doctrines. But this day has afforded me the completeſt
                    conviction, of the falſehood of the one, and the truth of the other. The
                    biſhops, who do not conceive themſelves to be deficient in learning, and whoſe
                    zeal for the maintenance of the hierarchy cannot be doubted, have abandoned
                    their religion, and their intereſt in it, as objects which admit of no defence
                    or juſtification.” All the other conſtituent members of this great council were
                    zealous for the eſtabliſhment of the reformation, and affirmed the propriety of
                    its doctrines. Thus the high court of parliament, with great deliberation and
                    ſolemnity, examined, voted, and ratified the confeſſion of the reformed
                    faith.</p>
                <p>A few days after the eſtabliſhment of the Conſeſſion of Faith, the parliament
                    paſſed an act againſt the maſs and the exerciſe of the Romiſh worſhip. And it
                    ſcrupled not to ordain, that all perſons ſaying or hearing maſs ſhould, for the
                    firſt offence, be expoſed to the confiſcation of their eſtates, and to a
                    corporal chaſtiſement, at the diſcretion of the magiſtrate; that for the ſecond
                    offence, they ſhould be baniſhed out of the kingdom; and that for the third
                    offence they ſhould incur and ſuffer the pains of death. This fierceneſs, it is
                    to be acknowledged, did not ſuit the generoſity of victory; and while an excuſe
                    is ſought for it in the perſidiouſneſs oſ the Romiſh prieſthood, it escapes not
                    the obſervation of the moſt ſuperficial hiſtorians, that theſe ſeverities were
                    exactly thoſe of which the Proteſtants had complained ſo loudly, and with ſo
                    much juſtice. By another ordination, the parliament, after having declared, that
                    the pope, or biſhop of Rome, had inflicted a deep wound and a humiliating injury
                    upon the ſovereignty and government of Scotland, by his frequent interferences
                    and claims of power, commanded and decreed, that, for the future, his
                    juriſdiction and authority ſhould be dead and extinct; and that all perſons
                    maintaining the ſmalleſt connection with him, or with his ſect, ſhould be liable
                    to the loſs of honour and offices, proſcription, and baniſhment.</p>
                <p>Theſe memorable and deciſive ſtatutes produced the overthrow of the Romiſh
                    religion. To obtain to theſe proceedings, and to its other ordinances, the
                    approbation of Francis and Mary was an object of the greateſt anxiety, and of
                    infinite moment to the three eſtates. Sir James Sandilands lord St John was
                    therefore appointed to go to France, and to expreſs to the king and queen the
                    affection and allegiance of their ſubjects, to explain what had been done in
                    conſequence of the late conceſſions and treaty, and to ſolicit their royal
                    ratification of the tranſactions of the parliament. The ſpirited behaviour of
                    the Congregation had, however, exceeded all the expectations of the princes of
                    Lorraine; and the buſineſs of the embaſſy, and the ambaffador himſelf, though a
                    man of character and probity, were treated not only with ridicule, but with
                    inſult and contumely. He. returned accordingly without any anſwer to his
                    commiſſion. Inſtead of ſubmitting the heads</p>
                <p>and topics of a reformation to Francis and Mary, by a petition or a narrative,
                    the parliament had voted them into laws; and from this informality the validity
                    of its proceedings has been ſuſpected. But it is obſervable of the Proteſtants,
                    that they had not concealed their views with regard to religion and the
                    abolition of Popery; that in the grant of redreſs and conceſſion, and in the
                    deed of treaty, no actual prohibition was made to bar the eſtabliſhment of the
                    reformation; that a general authority was given to the parliament to decide in
                    affairs of ſtate; and that Francis and Mary were ſolemnly bound to authenticate
                    its tranſactions. Though a formality was invaded, the ſpirit of the treaties was
                    yet reſpected and maintained. The nation, of conſequence, imputed the conduct of
                    Francis and Mary to political reaſons ſuggeſted by the princes of Lorraine, and
                    to the artifices of the Popiſh clergy; and as Elizabeth did not refuſe, upon her
                    part, the ratification of the agreements, and ſolicited and preſſed the French
                    court in vain to adopt the ſame meaſure, a ſtrength and force were thence
                    communicated to this concluſion.</p>
                <p>When the three eſtates diſpatched Sir James Sandilands to France, they inſtructed
                    the earls of Morton and Glencairn, with Maitland of Lethington, to repair to the
                    court of England. By theſe ambaſſadors they preſented to Elizabeth their ſincere
                    and reſpectful thanks, for the attention ſhown by her to Scotland, in her late
                    moſt important ſervices. And while they ſolicited the continuance of her favour
                    and protection, intreated, in an earned: manner, that her majeſty, for the
                    eſtabliſhment of a perpetual peace and amity, would be pleaſed to take in
                    marriage the earl of Arran, the next heir after his father to the Scottiſh
                    monarchy. The queen made new and fervent proteſtations of her regard and
                    attachment; and gave the promise of her warmeſt aid when it ſhould be neceffary,
                    in their juſt defence, upon any future occaſion. She ſpoke in obliging terms of
                    the earl of Arran; but as ſhe found in herſelf no preſent diſpoſition to
                    marriage, ſhe deſired that he might conſult his happineſs in another alliance.
                    She expreſſed a favourable opinion of the Scottiſh nobility; and as a
                    demonſtration of her affection and eſteem, ſhe took the liberty to remind them
                    of the practices which had been employed to overturn their independency, and
                    begged them to confider the unanimity and concord of their order as a neceſſary
                    guard againſt the ambition and the artifice of the enemies of their nation.</p>
                <p>The ſucceſs of the Congregation, though great and illuſtrious, was not yet
                    completely deciſive. The refuſal of Francis and Mary to ratify their proceedings
                    opened a ſource of bitterneſs and inquietude. The Popiſh party, though humbled,
                    was not annihilated. Under the royal protection it would ſoon be formidable.
                    Political conſiderations might ariſe, not only to cool the amity of England, but
                    even to provoke its reſentment. And France, though it could now tranſport no
                    army againſt Scotland, might ſoon be able to adopt that expedient. Cruel
                    diſtractions and ſevere calamities were ſtill to be dreaded. In the narrowneſs
                    of their own reſources they could find no ſolid and permanent ſecurity againſt
                    the rage and weight of domeſtic faction, and the ſtrenuous exertions of an
                    extenſive kingdom. All their fair atchievements might<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0047.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0041"/> be blasted
                    and overthrown. Popery might again build up her towers, and a ſangulnary
                    domination deſtroy alike their religious and civil liberties.</p>
                <p>While the anguiſh of melancholy apprehenſions repreſſed the triumph of the
                    Congregation, the event which could operate moſt to their intereſte was
                    announced to them. This event was the death of Francis IT. The tie which knit
                    Scotland to France was thus broken. A new ſcene of politics diſplays itself.
                    Catharine de Medicis, the queen-mother, ruled Charles IX. and was the perſonal
                    enemy of the queen of Scots. The power and the credit which Mary had lent to her
                    uncles, and the frequent and humiliating diſappointments which the queen-mother
                    had ſuffered from her influence over Francis, were now repaid with a ſtudied
                    indifference and neglect. In the full perfection of her charms, with two crowns
                    upon her head, and looking towards a third, ſhe felt herſelf to be without
                    grandeur and without conſequence. Leaving a court where ſhe had experienced all
                    the enjoyments of which humanity is ſuſceptible, ſhe retired to Rheims, to
                    indulge her ſorrow.</p>
                <p>In the humiliation of their queen, and in the change produced in the councils of
                    France, the Proteſtants of Scotland found every poſſible encouragement to
                    proceed with vigour in the full eſtabliſhment of the reformed doctrines, After
                    the diſſolving of the parliament, they turned their thoughts and attention to
                    the</p>
                <p>plan of policy which might suit beſt the tenets and religion for which they had
                    contended. The three eftates, amidſt their other tranſactions, had granted a
                    commiſſion to Mr John Winram, Mr John Spottiſwood, John Willocks, Mr John
                    Douglas, Mr John Row, and John Knox, to frame and model a ſcheme or platform of
                    eccleſiaſtical government. They were not long in complying with an order ſo
                    agreeable to them, and compoſed what is termed the <hi rend="italic">First Book
                        of Diſcipline;</hi> in which they explained the uniformity and method which
                    ought to be preſerved concerning doctrine, the adminiſtration of the ſacraments,
                    the election and proviſion of miniſters, and the policy of the church.</p>
                <p>A convention of the eſtatee gave its ſanction to the Preſbyterian ſcheme of
                    government. But while the Book of Diſcipline ſketched out a policy beautiful for
                    its ſimplicity, yet it required that the patrimony and the rich poſſeſſions of
                    the ancient church ſhould be allotted to the new eſtabliſhment, The reformers,
                    however, ſo ſucceſsful in the doctrines and the policy they had propoſed, were
                    here very unfortunate. This convention of the eſtates did not pay a more
                    reſpectful regard to this propofol than the celebrated parliament had done,
                    which demoliſhed the maſs and the jurisdiction of the fee of Rome. They affected
                    to conſider it as no better than a dream. The expreſſion “a devout imagination”
                    was applied to it in mockery; and it was not till after long and painful
                    ſtruggles, that the new eſtabliſhment was able to procure to itself a becoming
                    and neceſſary proviſion and ſuppoft. The Romiſh clergy were ſtrenuous to
                    continue in their poffeſſions, and to profit by them; and the nobles and the
                    laity having ſeized upon great proportions of the property of the church, were
                    no leſs anxious to retain the acquiſitions they had made.</p>
                <p>The averſion entertained from beſtowing riches upon</p>
                <p>the Preſbyterian eſtabliſhment, encouraged the ardour which prevailed for
                    advancing all the other views and intereſts of the reformed, And this end was
                    alſo promoted in no inconſiderable degree by the inſidious policy of Catharine
                    de Medicis. She was willing to increaſe and to foſter all the difficulties and
                    dangers in the ſituation of the queen of Scots and her ſubjects. Upon this
                    account ſhe had engaged Charles IX. to diſpatch Monſieur Noailles to the Scotch
                    parliament, to urge it in ſtrong terms to renew the ancient league between the
                    two kingdoms, to diſſolve the alliance with England, and to re-eſtabliſh over
                    Scotland the Popiſh doctrines and the Popiſh clergy. A new meeting of the
                    eſtates was aſſembled, which conſidered theſe ſtrange requiſitions, and treated
                    them with the indignation they merited. Monſieur Noailles was inſtructed to
                    inform his ſovereign, that France having acted with cruelty and perſidiouſneſs
                    towards the Scots, by attacking their independency and liberties under the cover
                    and pretence of amity and marriage, did not deſerve to know them any longer as
                    an ally; that principles of juſtice, a love of probity, and a high ſenſe of
                    gratitude, did not permit the Scottiſh parliament to break the confederacy with
                    England, which had generouſly protected their country againſt the tyrannical
                    views of the French court, and the treacherous machinations of the houſe of
                    Guiſe; and that they were never to acknowledge the Popiſh clergy to be a
                    diſtinct order of men, or the legal poſſeſſors of the patrimony of the church;
                    ſince, having aboliſhed the power of the pope, and renounced his doctrines, they
                    could beſtow no favour or countenance upon his vaſſals and ſervants.</p>
                <p>To this council of the eſtates a new ſupplication was preſented by the
                    Proteſtants. They departed from the high claim which they had made for the
                    riches and patrimony of the Popiſh church; and it was only requeſted by them,
                    that a reaſonable or decent proviſion ſhould be allotted to the true preachers
                    of the goſpel. This application, however, no leſs than their former exorbitant
                    demand, was treated with neglect and indifference. But amidſt the anxiety
                    manifeſted by the nobles and the tenants of the crown to hold the Preſbyterian
                    clergy in ſubjection and in poverty, they diſcovered the warmeſt zeal for the
                    extenſion and continuance of the reformed opinions. For in this ſupplication of
                    the Proteſtants, an ardent deſire being intimated and urged, that all the
                    monuments of idolatry which remained ſhould be utterly deſtroyed, the fulleſt
                    and moſt unbounded approbation was given to it. An act accordingly was paffed,
                    which commanded that every abbey-church, every cloister, and every memorial
                    whatſoever of Popery, ſhould be finally overthrown and demoliſhed: and the care
                    of this cruel, but popular employment, was committed to thoſe perſons who were
                    moſt remarkable for their keenneſs and ardour in the work of the reformation.
                    Its execution in the weſtern counties was given in charge to the earls of Arran,
                    Argyle, and Glencairn; the lord James Stuart attended to it in the more northern
                    diſtricts; and in the inland diviſions of the country, it was intruſted to the
                    barons in whom the Congregation had the greateſt confidence. A dreadful
                    devaſtation enſued. The populace, armed with authority, ſpread their ravages
                    over the kingdom. It was deemed an execrable lenity to ſpare any fabric or place
                    where idolatry had been exer-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0048.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0042"/> ciſed. The churches and religious houſes were
                    everywhere defaced, or pulled to the ground; and their furniture, utenſils, and
                    decorations, became the prizes and the property of the invader. Even the
                    ſepulchres of the dead were ranſacked and violated. The libraries of the
                    eccleſiaſtics, and the regiſters kept by them of their own tranſactions and of
                    civil affairs, were gathered into heaps, and committed to the flames. Religious
                    antipathy, the fonction of law, the exhortation of the clergy, the hope of
                    ſpoil, and, above all, the ardour to put the laſt hand to the reformation,
                    concurred to drive the rage of the people to its wildeſt fury; and, in the midſt
                    of havock and calamity, the new eſtabliſhment ſurveyed its importance and its
                    power.</p>
                <p>The death of Francis IL having left his queen, Mary, in a very diſagreeable
                    ſituation while ſhe remained in France, it now became neceſſary for her to think
                    on returning to her own country. To this ſhe was ſolicited both by the
                    Proteſtants and Papiſts; the former, that they might gain her over to their
                    party; and the latter, hoping that, as Mary was of their own perſuaſion, Popery
                    might once more be eſtabliſhed in Scotland. For this deputation, the Proteſtants
                    choſe lord James Stuart, natural brother to the queen; and the Papiſts, John
                    Leſly, official and vicar-general of the dioceſe of Aberdeen. The latter got the
                    ſtart of the Proteſtant ambaſſador, and thus had the opportunity of firſt
                    delivering his meſſage. He adviſed her ſtrongly to beware of the lord James
                    Stuart, whom he repreſented as a man of unbounded ambition, who had eſpouſed the
                    Proteſtant cauſe for no other reaſon than that he might advance himſelf to the
                    higheſt employments in the ſtate; nay, that he had already fixed his mind on the
                    crown itſelf. For theſe reaſons he adviſed that the lord James Stuart ſhould be
                    confined in France till the government of Scotland could be completely
                    eſtabliſhed. But if the queen was averſe to this meaſure, he adviſed her to land
                    in ſome of the northern diſtricts of Scotland, where her friends were moſt
                    numerous; in which caſe an army of 20,000 men would accompany her to Edinburgh,
                    to reſtore the Popiſh religion, and to overawe her enemies. The next day the
                    lord James Stuart waited upon her, and gave an advice very different from that
                    of Leſly. The ſureſt method of preventing inſurrections, he ſaid, was the
                    eſtabliſhment of the Proteſtant religion; that a ſtanding army and foreign
                    troops would certainly loſe the affections of her ſubjects; for which reaſon he
                    adviſed her to viſit Scotland without guards and without ſoldiers, and he became
                    ſolemnly bound to ſecure their obedience to her. To this advice Mary, though ſhe
                    diſtruſted its author, liſtened with attention; and lord James, imagining that
                    ſhe was prejudiced in his favour, took care to improve the favourable
                    opportunity; by which means he obtained a promiſe of the earldom of Marre.</p>
                <p>Before Mary ſet out from France, ſhe received an embaffy from queen Elizabeth,
                    preſſing her to ratify the treaty of Edinburgh, in which ſhe had taken care to
                    get a clauſe inſerted, that Francis and Mary ſhould <hi rend="italic">for
                        ever</hi> abſtain from aſſuming the title and arms of England and Ireland.
                    But this was declined by the queen of Scotland, who, in her conference with the
                    Engliſh ambaſſador, gave an eminent proof of her political abilities<note anchored="true" n="5" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>*See <hi
                                rend="italic">Robertson of Dalmeny's History of Mary Queen of
                                Scotland.</hi></p></note> *. Her refusal greatly augmented the</p>
                <p>jealouſies which already prevailed between her and Elizabeth, inſomuch that the
                    latter refuſed her a ſafe paſſage through her dominions into Scotland. This was
                    conſidered by Mary as a high indignity; ſhe returned a very ſpirited anſwer,
                    informing her rival, that ſhe could return to her own dominions without any
                    aſſiſtance from her, or indeed whether ſhe would or not. In the month of Auguſt
                    1561, Mary ſet ſail from Calais for Scotland. She left France with much regret;
                    and at night ordered her couch to be brought upon deck, deſiring the pilot to
                    awaken her in the morning if the coaſt of France ſhould be in view. The night
                    proved calm, ſo that the queen had an opportunity once more of indulging herſelf
                    with a fight of that beloved country. A favourable wind now ſprung up, and a
                    thick fog coming on, ſhe eſcaped a ſquadron of men of war which Elizabeth had
                    ſet out to intercept her; and on the 20th of the month ſhe landed ſafely at
                    Leith.</p>
                <p>But though the Scots received their queen with the greateſt demonſtrations of
                    joy, it was not long before an irreconcileable quarrel began to take place. The
                    Proteſtant religion was now eſtabliſhed all over the kingdom; and its profeſſors
                    had ſo far deviated from their own principles, or what ought to have been their
                    principles, that they would grant no toleration to the oppoſite party, not even
                    to the ſovereign herſelf. In conſequence of this, when the queen attempted to
                    celebrate maſs in her own chapel of Holyroodhouſe, a violent mob aſſembled, and
                    it was with the utmoſt difficulty that the lord James Stuart and ſome other
                    perſons of high diſtinction could appeaſe the tumult. Mary attempted to allay
                    theſe ferments by a proclamation, in which ſhe promiſed to take the advice of
                    the ſtates in religious matters; and, in the mean time, declared it to be death
                    for any perſon to attempt an innovation or alteration of the religion which ſhe
                    found generally eſtabliſhed upon her arrival in Scotland. Againſt this
                    proclamation the earl of Arran proteſted, and formally told the herald, the
                    queen’s proclamation ſhould not protect her attendants and ſervants if they
                    preſumed to commit idolatry and to ſay maſs. John Knox declared from the pulpit,
                    that one maſs was more terrible to him than if 10,000 armed enemies had landed
                    in any part of the kingdom to re-eſtablilh Popery. The preachers everywhere
                    declaimed againſt idolatry and the maſs; keeping up, by their miſtaken zeal, a
                    ſpirit of diſcontent and ſedition throughout the whole kingdom. John Knox was
                    called before the queen to anſwer for the freedom of his ſpeeches; but his
                    unbounded boldneſs when there gave Mary much diſquiet, as not knowing in what
                    manner to deal with him. The freedoms, however, which were taken with the queen,
                    could not induce her to depart from that plan of government which ſhe had laid
                    down in France. To the Proteſtants ſhe reſolved to pay the greateſt attention;
                    from among them ſhe choſe her privy-council, and heaped favours upon the lord
                    James Stuart, who for his activity in promoting the reformation was the moſt
                    popular man in the kingdom; while to her courtiers of the Roman Catholic
                    perſuaſion ſhe behaved with a diſtant formality.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the difference between the two rival queens became every day
                    greater. The queen of Scotland preſſed Elizabeth to declare her the neareſt<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0049.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0043"/> heir to the
                    crown of England, and Elizabeth preſſed Mary to confirm the treaty of Edinburgh.
                    With thi3 the latter could not comply, as it would in fact have been renouncing
                    for ever the title to that crown for which ſhe was ſo earneſtly contending.
                    Endleſs negociations were the conſequence, and the hatred of Elizabeth to Mary
                    continually increaſed. This year the queen of Scotland amuſed herſelf by making
                    a circuit through part of her dominions. From Edinburgh ſhe proceeded to
                    Stirling; from thence to Perth, Dundee, and St Andrew’s. Though received
                    everywhere with the greateſt acclamations and marks of affection, ſhe could not
                    but remark the rooted aversion which had univerſally taken place againſt Popery;
                    and upon her return to Edinburgh, her attention was called to an exertion of
                    this zeal, which may be conſidered as highly characteriſtic of the times. The
                    magiſtrates of this city, after their election, enacted rules, according to
                    cuſtom, for the government of their borough. By one of theſe acts, which they
                    publiſhed by proclamation, they commanded all monks, friars, and prieſts,
                    together with all adulterers and fornicators, to depart from the town and its
                    limits within 24 hours, under the pains of correction and puniſhment. Mary,
                    juſtly interpreting this exertion of power to be an uſurpation of the royal
                    authority, and a violation of order, displaced the magiſtrates, commanded the
                    citizens to elect others in their room, and granted by proclamation a plenary
                    indulgence to all her ſubjects not convicted of any crime, to repair to and
                    remain in her capital at their pleaſure.</p>
                <p>Beſides theſe diſturbances on account of religion, the kingdom was now in
                    confuſion on another account. The long continuance of civil wars had left a
                    proneneſs to tumults and inſurrections everywhere; and thefts, rapine, and
                    licentiouſneſs of every kind, threatened to ſubvert the foundations of civil
                    ſociety. Mary made conſiderable preparations for the ſuppreſſion of theſe
                    diſorders, and appointed the lord James Stuart her chief juſtſeiar and
                    lieutenant. He was to hold two criminal courts, the one at Jedburgh, and the
                    other at Dumfries. To aſſiſt his operations againſt the banditti, who who were
                    armed, and often aſſociated into bodies, a military force was neceſſary; but as
                    there were at preſent neither Handing army nor regular troops in the kingdom,
                    the county of Edinburgh, and ten others, were commanded to have their ſtrength
                    in readineſs to aſſiſt him. The feudal tenants, and the allodial or free
                    proprietors of theſe diſtricts, in complete armour, and with proviſions for 20
                    days, were appointed to be ſubſervient to the purpoſes of his commiſſion, and to
                    obey his orders in eſtabliſhing the public tranquillity. In this expedition he
                    was attended with his uſual ſucceſs. He deſtroyed many of the ſtrong-holds of
                    the banditti; hanged 20 of the moſt notorious offenders; and ordered 50 more to
                    be carried to Edinburgh, there to ſuffer the penalties of law on account of
                    their rebellious behaviour. He entered into terms with the lord Grey and Sir
                    John Foſter, the wardens of the Engliſh borders, for the mutual benefit of the
                    two nations; and he commanded the chiefs of the diſorderly clans to ſubmit to
                    the queen, and to obey her orders with regard to the ſecuring of the peace, and
                    preventing inſurrections and depredations for the future.</p>
                <p>In the mean time the queen was in a very diſagreeable ſituation, being ſuſpected
                    and diſtruſted by both parties. From the conceſſions ſhe had made to the
                    Proteſtants, the Papiſts ſuppoſed that ſhe had a deſign of renouncing their
                    religion altogether; while, on the other hand, the Proteſtants could ſcarcely
                    allow themselves to believe that they owed any allegiance to an idolater.
                    Diſquiets of another kind alſo now took place. The duke of Chatelherault, having
                    left the Catholics to join the oppoſite party, was neglected by his ſovereign.
                    Being afraid of ſome danger to himſelf, he fortified the caſtle of Dumbarton,
                    which he reſolved to defend; and in caſe of neceſſity to put himſelf under the
                    protection of the queen of England.—The earl of Arran was a man of very ſlender
                    abilities, but of boundleſs ambition. The queen’s beauty had made an impreſſion
                    on his heart, and his ambition made him fancy himſelf the fitteſt perſon in the
                    kingdom for her huſband. But his fanaticiſm, and the violence with which he had
                    oppoſed the maſs, diſguſted her. He bore her diſlike with an uneaſineſs that
                    preyed upon his intellects and diſordered them. It was even ſuppoſed that he had
                    concerted a ſcheme to poſſeſs himſelf of her perſon by armed retainers; and the
                    lords of her court were commanded to be in readineſs to defeat any project of
                    this fort. The earl of Bothwel was diſtinguiſhed chiefly by his prodigalities
                    and the licentiouneſs of his manners. The earl of Mariſchal had every thing that
                    was honourable in his intentions, but was overwary and ſlow. The earl of Morton
                    poſſeſſed penetration and ability, but was attached to no party or meaſures from
                    any principles of rectitude: His own advantage and interdis were the motives
                    which governed him. The earl of Huntley the lord chancellor, was unquiet,
                    variable, and vindictive: His paſſions, now fermenting with violence, were ſoon
                    to break forth in the moſt dangerous practices. The earls of Glencairn and
                    Menteith were deeply tinctured with fanaticiſm; and their inordinate zeal for
                    the new opinions, not leſs than their poverty, recommended them to queen
                    Elizabeth. Her ambaſſador Randolph, adviſed her to ſecure them ſervice, by
                    addreſſing herſelf to their neceſſities. Among courtiers of this deſcription, it
                    was difficult for Mary to make a ſelection of miniſters in whom to confide. The
                    conſequence and popularity of the lord James Stuart, and of Maitland of
                    Lethington, had early pointed them out to this diſtinction; and hitherto they
                    had acted to her ſatisfaction. They were each of eminent capacity: but the
                    former was ſuſpected of aiming at the ſovereignty; the latter was prone to
                    refinement and duplicity; and both were more connected with Elizabeth than
                    became them as the miniſters and ſubjects of another ſovereign.</p>
                <p>Beſide the policy of employing and truſting ſtateſmen who were Proteſtants, and
                    the precaution of maintaining a firm peace with England, Mary had it alſo at
                    heart to enrich the crown with the revenues of the ancient church. A convention
                    of eſtates was aſſembled to deliberate upon this meaſure. The biſhops were
                    alarmed with their perilous ſituation. It was made known to them, that the
                    charge of the queen’s houſe- hold required an augmentation; and that as the
                    rents of the church had flowed chiefly from the crown, it was expedient that a
                    proper proportion of them ſhould now be reſumed to uphold its ſplendour. After

                    exiſted merely by the favour of the queen, conſented to resign to her the third
                    part of their benefices, to be managed at her pleaſure; with the reſervation
                    that they ſhould be ſecured during their lives againſt all farther payments, and
                    relieved from the burden of contributing to the maintenance of the reformed
                    clergy. With this offer the queen and the convention of eſtates were ſatisfied.
                    Rentals, accordingly, of all their benefices throughout the kingdom, were
                    ordered to be produced by the ancient eccleſiaſtics; the reformed miniſters,
                    ſuperintendants, elders, and deacons, were enjoined to make out regiſters of the
                    grants or proviſions neceſſary to ſupport their eſtabliſhment; and a
                    ſupereminent power of judging in theſe matters was committed to the queen and
                    the privy-council.</p>
                <p>While the prelates and eſtate eccleſiaſtical ſubmitted to this offer from the
                    neceſſity of their affairs, it was by no means acceptable to the reformed
                    clergy, who at this time were holding an aſſembly. It was their earneſt wiſh to
                    effect the entire deſtruction of the ancient eſtabliſhment, to ſucceed to a
                    large proportion of their emoluments, and to be altogether independent of the
                    crown. But while the Proteſtant preachers were naturally and unanimouſly of
                    theſe ſentiments, the nobles and gentlemen who had promoted the reformation were
                    diſpoſed to think very differently. To give too much of the wealth of the church
                    to the reformed clergy, was to inveſt them with a dangerous power. To give too
                    great a proportion of it to the crown, was a ſtep ſtill more dangerous. At the
                    ſame time it was equitable, that the ancient clergy ſhould be maintained during
                    their lives; and it conſiſted with the private intereſts of the noblemen and
                    gentlemen, who had figured during the reformation, not to conſent to any ſcheme
                    that would deprive them of the ſpoils of which they had already poſſeſſed
                    themſelves out of the ruins of the church, or which they might ſtill be enabled
                    to acquire.</p>
                <p>Thus public as well as private conſiderations contributed to ſeparate and divide
                    the lay Proteſtants and the preachers. The general aſſembly, therefore, of the
                    church, was not by any means ſucceſsful in the views which had called them
                    together at this time, and which they ſubmitted to the convention of eſtates.
                    Doubts were entertained whether the church had any title to aſſemble itſelf. The
                    petition preferred for the complete abolition of idolatry, or for the utter
                    prohibition of the maſs, was rejected, notwithſtanding all the zeal manifeſted
                    by the brethren. The requeſt that Mary ſhould give authority to the book of
                    diſcipline, was not only refuſed, but even treated with ridicule. The only point
                    preſſed by the church, which attracted any notice, was its requiſition of a
                    proviſion or a maintenance; but the meaſure invented for this end was in
                    oppoſition to all its warmeſt deſires.</p>
                <p>This meaſure, however, ſo unpromiſing to the preachers in expectation, was found
                    to be ſtill more unſatisactory upon trial. The wealth of the Romiſh church had
                    been immenſe, but great invafions had been made upon it. The fears of the
                    eccleſiaſtics, upon the overthrow of popery, induced them to engage in
                    fraudulent tranſactions with their kinſmen and relations; in conſequence of
                    which many poſſeſſions were conveyed from the church into private hands. For
                    valuable conſiderations, leaſes of church-lands, to endure for many years, or in
                    perpetuity, were granted to ſtrangers and adven</p>
                <p>turers. Sales alſo of eccleſiaſtical property, to a great extent, had been made
                    by the ancient incumbents; and a validity was ſuppoſed to be given to theſe
                    tranſactions by confirmations from the pope, who was zealous to aſſiſt his
                    votaries. Even the crown itſelf had contributed to make improper diſpoſitions of
                    the eccleſiaſtical revenues. Laymen had been preſented to biſhoprics and
                    church-livings, with the power of diſpoſing of the territory in connection with
                    them. In this diffuſion of the property of the church, many fair acquiſitions,
                    and much extenſive domain, came to be inveſted in the nobles and the gentry.</p>
                <p>From theſe cauſes, the grant of the third of their benefices, made by the ancient
                    eccleſiaſtics to the queen, with the burden of maintaining the reformed clergy,
                    was not near ſo conſiderable as might have been expected. But the direction of
                    the ſcheme being lodged in the queen and the privy-council, the advantage to the
                    crown was ſtill greater than that beſtowed upon the preachers. Yet the carrying
                    the project into execution was not without its inconveniences. There were ſtill
                    many opportunities for artifice and corruption; and the full third of the
                    eccleſiaſtical benefices, even after all the previous abſtractions of them which
                    had been made, could not be levied by any diligence. For the eccleſiaſtics often
                    produced falſe rentals of their benefices; and the collectors for the crown were
                    not always faithful to the trull repoſed in them. The complete produce of the
                    thirds did not amount to a great ſum; and it was to operate to the expences of
                    the queen, as well as to the ſupport of the preachers. A ſcanty proportion went
                    to the latter; and yet the perſons who were choſen to fix and aſcertain their
                    particular ſtipends or proviſions were the faſt friends of the reformation. For
                    this buſineſs was committed in charge to the earls of Argyle and Morton, the
                    lord James Stuart, and Maitland of Lethington, with James Mackgill the clerk-
                    regiſter, and Sir John Ballenden the juſtice-clerk. One hundred Scottiſh merks
                    were deemed ſufficient for a common miniſter. To the clergymen of greater
                    intereſt or conſideration, or who exerciſed their functions in more extenſive
                    pariſhes, 300 merks were allotted; and, excepting to ſuperintendants, this ſum
                    was ſeldom exceeded. To the earl of Argyle, to the lord James Stuart, to Lord
                    Erſkme, who had large eccleſiaſtical revenues, their thirds were uſually
                    remitted by the queen; and upon the eſtabliſhment of this fund or revenue, ſhe
                    alſo granted many penſions to perſons about her court and of her houſehold.</p>
                <p>The complaints of the preachers were made with little decency, and did not
                    contribute to better their condition. The coldneſs of the Proteſtant laity, and
                    the humanity ſhown to the ancient clergy, were deep wounds both to their pride
                    and to their intereſts. To a mean ſpirit of flattery to the reigning power, they
                    imputed the defection of their friends; and againſt the queen they were animated
                    with the bittereſt animoſity. The poverty in which they were ſuffered to remain
                    inflamed all their paſſions. They induſtriouſly ſought to indulge their rancour
                    and turbulence; and inveterate habits of inſult fortified them into a contempt
                    of authority.</p>
                <p>To the queen, whoſe temper was warm, the rudeneſs of the preachers was a painful
                    and endleſs inquietude, which, while it foſtered her religious prejudices, had
                    the good effect to confirm her conſtancy to her friends,<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0051.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0045"/> and to keep
                    alive her gratitude for their activity. The lord James Stuart, who was intitled
                    to her reſpect and eſteem from his abilities, and his proximity to her in blood,
                    had merited rewards and honours by his public ſervices and the vigour of his
                    counſels. After his ſucceſsful diſcharge of her commiſſion as chief juſticiar
                    and lord lieutenant, ſhe could not think of allowing him to deſcend from theſe
                    offices, without beſtowing upon him a ſolid and permanent mark of her favour.
                    She advanced him into the rank of her nobility, by conferring upon him the
                    earldom of Marre. At the ſame time ſhe contributed to augment his conſequence,
                    by facilitating his marriage with Agnes the daughter of the earl of Mariſchal;
                    and the ceremonial of this alliance was celebrated with a magnificence and
                    oſtentation ſo extravagant in that age, as to excite the fears of the preachers
                    left ſome avenging judgment or calamity ſhould afflict the land. They exclaimed
                    with virulence againſt his riotous feaſting and banquets; and the maſquerades
                    which were exhibited upon this occaſion, attracting in a ſtill greater degree
                    their attention, as being a ſpecies of entertainment hitherto unknown in
                    Scotland, and which was favourable to the profaneneſs of gallantly, they pointed
                    againſt them the keenneſt ſtrokes of their cenſure and indignation.</p>
                <p>The abilities of the earl of Marre, the aſcendency he maintained in the councils
                    of his ſovereign, and the diſtinctions which he had acquired, did not fail to
                    expoſe him to uncommon envy. The moſt deſperate of his enemies, and the moſt
                    formidable, was the earl of Huntley. In their rivalſhip for power, many cauſes
                    of diſguſt had ariſen. The one was at the head of the Proteſtants, the other was
                    the leader of the Papiſts. Upon the death of Francis II. Huntley and the Popiſh
                    faction had lent a deputation to Mary, inviting her to return to Scotland, and
                    offering to ſupport her with an army of 20,000 men. His advances were treated
                    with attention and civility, but his offer was rejected. The invitation of the
                    Proteſtants, preſented by the earl of Marre, was more acceptable to her. Huntley
                    had adviſed her to detain his rival in confinement in France till the Roman
                    Catholic religion ſhould be re-eſtabliſhed in Scotland. This advice ſhe not only
                    diſregarded, but careſſed his enemy with particular civilities. Upon her arrival
                    in her own country, Huntley renewed his advances, offering to her to ſet up the
                    maſs in all the northern counties. He even converted in a preſſing manner upon
                    this ſubject with her uncles and the French courtiers who attended her. Still no
                    real attention was paid to him. He came to her palace, and was received only
                    with reſpect. He was lord high chancellor without influence, and a privy
                    counſellor without truſt. The earl of Marre had the confidence of his ſovereign,
                    and was drawing to him the authority of government.</p>
                <p>Theſe were cruel mortifications to a man of high rank, inordinate ambition,
                    immenſe wealth, and who commanded numerous and warlike retainers. But he was yet
                    to feel a ſtroke ſtill more ſeverely excruciating, and far more deſtructive of
                    his conſequence. The opulent eſtate of Marre, which Mary had erected, into an
                    earldom, and conferred upon his rival, had been lodged in his family for ſome
                    time. He conſidered it as his property, and that it was never to be torn from
                    his houſe. This blow was at once to inſult moſt ſenſibly his pride, and to cut
                    moſt fatally the ſinews of his greatneſs,</p>
                <p>After employing againſt the earl of Marre thoſe arts of detraction and calumny
                    which are ſo common in courts, he drew up and ſubſcribed a formal memorial, in
                    which he accuſed him of aiming at the ſovereignty of Scotland. This paper he
                    preſented to the queen; but the arguments with which he ſupported his charge
                    being weak and inconcluſive, ſhe was the more confirmed in her attachment to her
                    miniſter. Huntley then addreſſing himſelf to the earl of Bothwel, a man diſpoſed
                    to deſperate courſes, engaged him to attempt to involve the earl of Marre and
                    the houſe of Hamilton in open and violent contention. Bothwel repreſented to
                    Marre the enmity which had long ſubſiſted between him and the houſe of Hamilton.
                    It was an obſtacle to his greatneſs; and while its deſtruction might raiſe him
                    to the higheſt pinnacle of power, it would be moſt acceptable to the queen, who,
                    beſide the hatred which princes naturally entertain to their ſucceſſors, was
                    animated by particular cauſes of offence againſt the duke of Chatelherauit and
                    the earl of Arran. He concluded his exhortation with making an unlimited offer
                    of his moſt ſtrenuous ſervices in the execution of this flagitious enterpriſe.
                    The earl of Marre, however, abhorring the baſeneſs of the project, ſuſpicious of
                    the ſincerity of the propoſer, or ſatisfied that his eminδnce did not require
                    the aid of ſuch arts, rejected all his advances. Bothwel, diſappointed upon one
                    fide, turned himſelf to the other. He practiſed with the houſe of Hamilton to
                    aſſaſſinate the earl of Marre, whom they conſidered as their greateſt enemy. The
                    buſineſs, he ſaid, might be performed with eaſe and expedition. The queen was in
                    uſe to hunt the deer in the park of Falkland; and there the earl of Marre,
                    unſuſpecting any danger, and ſlenderly attended, might be overpowered and put to
                    death. The perſon oſ the queen, at the ſame time, might be ſeized; and by
                    detaining her in cuſtody, a ſanction and ſecurity might be given to their crime.
                    The integrity of the earl of Arran revolting againſt this conſpiracy, defeated
                    its purpoſes. Dreading the perpetration of ſo cruel an action, and yet ſenſible
                    of the reſolute determination of his friends, he wrote privately to the earl of
                    Marre, informing him of his danger But the return of Marre to his letter,
                    thanking him for his intelligence, being intercepted by the conlpirators, Arran
                    was confined by them under a guard in Kenneil-houſe. He effected notwithſtanding
                    his eſcape, and made a full diſcovery of the plot to the queen. Yet in a matter
                    ſo dark he could produce no witneſſes and no written vouchers to confirm his
                    accuſations. He therefore, according to the faſhion of the times, offered to
                    prove his information, by engaging Bothwel in ſingle combat. And though, in his
                    examinations before the privy council, his love to the queen, his attachment to
                    the earl of Marre, the atrocity of the ſcheme he revealed, and, above all, his
                    duty and concern for his father the duke of Chatelherauit, threw him into a
                    perturbation of mind which expreſſed itſelf violently in his ſpeech, his
                    countenance, and his actions; yet his declarations, in general, were ſo
                    conſiſtent and. firm, that it was thought adviſable to take the command of the
                    caſtle of Dumbarton from 'the duke of Chatelherault, to confine the other
                    conſpirators to different priſons, and to wait the farther diſcovevies which
                    might be made by accident and time.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0052.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0046"/> The earl of Huntley, inflamed by theſe
                    diſappointments, invented other devices. He excited a tumult while the queen and
                    the earl of Marre were at St Andrew’s with only a few attendants; imagining that
                    the latter would ſally forth to quell the inſurgents, and that a convenient
                    opportunity would thus be afforded for putting him to the ſword without
                    detection. The caution, however, of the earl of Marre, defeating this purpoſe,
                    he ordered ſome of his retainers to attack him in the evening when he ſhould
                    leave the queen; but theſe aſſaſſins being ſurpriſed in their ſtation, Huntley
                    affected to excuſe their being in arms in a ſuſpicious place and at a late hour,
                    by frivolous apologies, which, though admitted, could not be approved.</p>
                <p>About this period, too, letters were received by Mary from the pope and the
                    cardinal of Lorrain, in conſequence of the intrigues of the earl of Huntley and
                    the Roman Catholic faction. They preſſed her to confider, that while this
                    nobleman was the most powerful of her ſubjects, he was by far the moſt zeallous
                    in the intereſts of the church of Rome. They intreated her to flatter him with
                    the hope of her marriage with Sir John Gordon his ſecond ſon; held out to her
                    magnificent promiſes of money and military ſupplies, if ſhe would ſet herſelf
                    ſeriouſly to recover to power and ſplendour the ancient religion of her country;
                    and recommended it to her to take meaſures to deſtroy the more ſtrenuous
                    Proteſtants about her court, of whom a roll was tranſmitted to her, which
                    included the name of her confident and miniſter the earl of Marrel Theſe letters
                    could not have reached her at a juncture more unfavourable for their ſucceſs.
                    The earl of Marre, to whom ſhe communicated them, was encouraged to proceed with
                    the greateſt vigour in undermining the deſigns and the importance of his
                    enemies.</p>
                <p>New incidents exaſperated the animoſities of the enemies of the earl of Marre and
                    his own. Sir John Gordon and the lord Ogilvie having a private diſpute, happened
                    to meet each other in the high ſtreet of Edinburgh. They immediately drew their
                    ſwords; and the lord Ogilvie receiving a very dangerous wound, Sir John Gordon
                    was committed to priſon by the magiſtrates. The queen, at this time in Stirling,
                    was informed by them of the riot; and while they expreſſed a fear left the
                    friends of the priſoner ſhould rife up in arms to give him his liberty, they
                    mentioned a ſuſpicion which prevailed, that the partizans of the lord Ogilvie
                    were to aſſemble themſelves to vindicate his quarrel. The queen, in her reply,
                    after commending their diligence, inſtructed them to continue to have a watch
                    over their priſoner; made known her deſire that the law ſhould take its courſe;
                    and counſelled them to have no apprehenſions of the kindred of the parties at
                    variance, but to rely upon the earl of Marre for providing a ſufficient force
                    for their protection. Sir John Gordon, however, found the means to break from
                    his confinement; and flying into Aberdeenſhire, filled the retainers of his
                    family with his complaints, and added to the diſquiets of his father the earl of
                    Huntley.</p>
                <p>The queen, upon returning to Edinburgh, held a conſultation upon affairs of ſtate
                    with her privy council; and ſoon after ſet out upon a progreſs to the northern
                    parts of her kingdom. At Aberdeen ſhe was met by the lady Huntley, a woman of
                    deep diflimulation and of refined addreſs; who endeavoured to conciliate her
                    affections, was prodigal of flattery, expreſſed her zeal for the Popiſh
                    religion, and let fall inſinuations of the great power of her huſband. She then
                    interceded with the queen for forgiveneſs to her ſon: and begged with a keen
                    importunity, that he might be permitted to have the honour to kiſs her hand. But
                    Mary having told her, that the favour ſhe had ſolicited could not poſſibly be
                    granted till her ſon ſhould return to the priſon from which he had eſcaped, and
                    ſubmit to the juſtice of his country, the lady Huntley engaged that he ſhould
                    enter again into cuſtody, and only intreated, that, inſtead of being confined at
                    Edinburgh, he ſhould be conducted to the caſtle of Stirling. This requeſt was
                    complied with; and in the proſecution of the buſineſs, a court of juſticiary
                    being called, Sir John Gordon made his appearance, and acknowledged himſelf to
                    be the queen’s priſoner. The lord Glamis was appointed to conduct him to the
                    caſtle of Stirling. But upon the road to this fortreſs, he deceived the
                    vigilance of his guards, haſtened back, and gathering 1000 horſemen among his
                    retainers, entruſted his ſecurity to the ſword.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the queen continued her progreſs. The earl of Huntley joined
                    himſelf to her train. His anxiety to induce her to allow him to attend her to
                    his houſe of Strathbogy was uncommon; his intreaties were even preſſed beyond
                    the bounds of propriety. The intelligence arrived of the eſcape and rebellion of
                    Sir John Gordon. The behaviour of the father and the ſon awakened in her the
                    moſt alarming ſuſpicions. Aſſembling her privy-council, who, according to the
                    faſhion of thoſe times, conſtituted her court, and attended her perſon in her
                    progreſſes though her dominions; ſhe, with their advice, commanded her heralds
                    to charge Sir John Gordon and his adherents to return to their allegiance, and
                    to ſurrender up to her their houſes of ſtrength and caſtles, under the pains of
                    high treaſon and forfeiture. Diſdaining now to go to the houſe of the earl of
                    Huntley, where, as it afterwards appeared, that nobleman had made ſecret
                    preparations to hokl her in captivity, ſhe advanced to Inverneſs by a different
                    rout. In the caſtle of Inverneſs ſhe propoſed to take up her reſidence; but
                    Alexander Gordon the deputy governor, a dependent of the family of Huntley,
                    refuſed to admit her. She was terrified with the proſpect of a certain and
                    imminent danger. Her attendants were few in number, the town was without walls,
                    and the inhabitants were ſuſpected. In this extremity, ſome ſhips in the river
                    were kept in readineſs as a laſt refuge; and ſhe iſſued a proclamation,
                    commanding all her loyal ſubjects in thoſe parts immediately to repair to her
                    for her protection. The Fraſers and Monroes came in crowds to make her the offer
                    of their ſwords. The Clan Chattan, though called to arms by the earl of Huntley,
                    forſook his ſtandard for that of their ſovereign, when they diſcovered that his
                    intentions were hoſtile to her. She employed this ſtrength in laying ſiege to
                    the caſtle, which ſurrendered itſelf upon the firſt aſſault. The lives of the
                    common ſoldiers were ſpared, but the deputy- governor was inſtantly executed.
                    The queen, full of apprehenſions, returned to Aberdeen.</p>
                <p>To intimidate the earl of Huntley, to puniſh the troubles which his family had
                    created to the queen, and to convince him that his utter ruin was at hand,<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0053.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0047"/> a meaſure
                    infinitely humiliating was now concerted and put in practice. The earl of Marre
                    reſigned the rich eſtate of that name to the lord Erſkine, who laid claim to it
                    as his right; and received in recompenſe, after its erection into an earldom,
                    the territory of Murray, which made an extenſive portion of the poſſeſſions of
                    the carl of Huntley.</p>
                <p>The lady Huntley haſtened to Aberdeen to throw herſelf at the feet of her
                    ſovereign, to make the offer of the moſt humble ſubmiſſions on the part of her
                    huſband, and to avert by every poſſible means the downfal of his greatneſs. But
                    all acceſs to the queen was refuſed to her; and the earl of Huntley was ſummoned
                    to appear in perſon before the privy council, to anſwer for his conduct, and to
                    make a full reſignation of all his caſtles and fortreſſes. He did not preſent
                    himſelf, and was declared to be in open rebellion. A new proclamation was
                    circulated by the queen to collect together a ſufficient ſtrength to ſubdue the
                    inſurgents. The command of her troops was given to the earl of Murray, who put
                    them inſtantly into motion. Huntley advancing towards Abcrdeen to give them
                    battle, was informed of their approach. He halted at Corrichie, ſolacing himſelf
                    with the hope of a deciſive victory. The army of the queen was the moſt
                    numerous; but there were ſeveral companies in it in whom little confidence could
                    be placed. Theſe the earl of Murray poſted in the front of the battle, and
                    commanded them to begin the attack. They recoiled upon him in diſorder,
                    according to his expectation; but a reſolute band in whom he truſted, holding
                    out their ſpears, obliged them to take a different courſe. Their confuſion and
                    flight made Huntley conceive that the day was his own. He therefore ordered his
                    ſoldiers to throw aſide their lances, and to ruſh upon the enemy ſword in hand.
                    His command was obeyed, but with no precaution or diſcipline. When his men came
                    to the place where the earl of Murray had ſtatroned himſelf, the points of the
                    extended ſpears of his firm battalion put a termination to their progreſs. The
                    panic communicated by this unexpected reſiſtance was improved by the vigour with
                    which he preſſed the aſſailants. In their turn they took to flight. The
                    companies of the queen’s army which had given way in the beginning of the
                    conflict were now diſpoſed to atone for their miſconduct; and taking a ſhare in
                    the battle, committed a ſignal ſlaughter upon the retainers of the earl of
                    Huntley. This nobleman himſelf expired in the throng of the purſuit. His ſons
                    Sir John Gordon and Adam Gordon were made priſoners, with the principal
                    gentlemen who had aſſiſted him.</p>
                <p>Mary, upon receiving the tidings of this ſucceſs, diſcovered neither joy nor
                    ſorrow. The paſſions, however, of the earl of Murray and his party were not yet
                    completely gratified. Sir John Gordon was brought immediately to trial,
                    confeſſed his guilt, and was condemned to ſuffer as a traitor. The ſentence
                    accordingly was executed, amidſt a multitude of ſpectators, whoſe feelings were
                    deeply affected, while they conſidered his immature death, the manlineſs of his
                    ſpirit, and the vigour of his form. Adam Gordon, upon account of his tender age,
                    was pardoned; and fines were levied from the other captives of condition
                    according to then wealth. The lord Gordon, after the battle of Corrichie, fled
                    to his father-in-law the duke of Chatel-</p>
                <p>herault, and put himſelf under his protection; but was delivered up by that
                    nobleman, all whoſe endeavours in his favour were ineffectual. He was convicted
                    of treaſon, and condemned; but the queen was ſatisfied with confining him in
                    priſon. The dead body of the earl of Huntley was carried to Edinburgh, and kept
                    without burial, till a charge of high treaſon was preferred againſt him before
                    the three eſtates. An oſtentatious diſplay was made of his criminal enterpriſes,
                    and a verdict of parliament pronounced his guilt. His eſtates, hereditary and
                    moveable, were forfeited; his dignity, name, and memory, were pronounced to be
                    extinct; his enſigns armorial were torn from the book of arms; and his poſterity
                    were rendered unable to enjoy any offices, honour, or rank, within the
                    realm.</p>
                <p>While theſe ſcenes were tranſacting, Mary, who was ſincerely ſolicitous to
                    eſtabliſh a ſecure amity between the two kingdoms, opened a negociation to
                    effectuate an interview with Elizabeth. Secretary Maitland, whom ſhe employed in
                    this buſineſs, met with a moſt gracious reception at the court of London. The
                    city of York was appointed as the place where the two queens ſhould expreſs
                    their mutual love and affection, and bind themſelves to each other in an
                    indiſſoluble union; the day of their meeting was fixed; the faſhion and articles
                    of their interview were adjuſted; and a ſafe-conduct into England was granted to
                    the queen of Scots by Elizabeth. But in this advanced ſtate of the treaty it was
                    unexpectedly interrupted. The diſturbances in France, the perſecution of the
                    Proteſtants there, and the dangerous conſequence which threatened the reformed
                    countries, ſeemed to require Elizabeth to be particularly upon her guard, and to
                    watch with eagerneſs againſt the machinations of the adverſaries of her
                    religion. Upon theſe pretences ſhe declined for a ſeaſon the projected
                    interview; ſending to Mary with this apology Sir Henry Sidney, a miniſter of
                    ability, whom ſhe inſtructed to dive into the ſecret views of the Scottiſh
                    queen. This was a ſevere diſappointment to Mary; but it is reaſonable to
                    believe, that Elizabeth acted in the negociation without ſincerity, and upon
                    principles of policy. It was not her intereſt to admit into her kingdom a queen
                    who had pretenſions to her crown, and who might ſtrengthen them; wſho might
                    raiſe the expectations of her Roman Catholic ſubjects, and advance herſelf in
                    their eſteem; and who far ſurpaſſed her in beauty, and in the bewitching
                    allurement of converſation and behaviour.</p>
                <p>Amidſt affairs of great moment, a matter of ſmaller conſequence, but which is
                    intereſting in its circumſtances, deferves to be recorded. Chatelard, a
                    gentleman of family in Dauphiny, and a relation of the chevalier de Bayard, had
                    been introduced to queen Mary by the ſieur Damville, the heir of the houſe of
                    Montmorency. Poliſhed manners, vivacity, attention to pleaſe, the talent of
                    making verſes, and an agreeable figure, were recommendations to this man. In the
                    court they drew attention to him. He made himſelf neceſtary in all parties of
                    pleaſure at the palace. His aſſiduities drew to him the notice of the queen;
                    and, at different times, ſhe did him the honour to dance with him. His
                    complaiſance became gradually more familiar. He entertained her with his wit and
                    good-humour; he made verſes upon her beauty and accompliſhments; and her
                    politeneſs and condeſcenſion inſinuated<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0054.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0048"/> into him other sentiments than gratitude and
                    reverence, He could not behold her charms without feeling their power: and
                    inſtead of ſtifling in its birth the moſt dangerous of all the paſſions, he
                    encouraged its growth. In an unhappy moment, he entered her apartment; and,
                    concealing himſelf under her bed, waited the approach of night. While the queen
                    was undreſſing, her maids diſcovered his ſituation, and gave her the alarm.
                    Chatelard was diſmiſſed with diſgrace; but ſoon after received her pardon. The
                    frenzy, however, of his love compelling him to repeat his crime, it was no
                    longer proper to ſhow any compaſſion to him. The delicate ſituation of Mary, the
                    noiſe of theſe adventures, which had gone abroad, and the rude ſuſpicions of her
                    ſubjects, required that he ſhould be tried for his offences and puniſhed. This
                    imprudent man was accordingly condemned to loſe his head; and the ſentence was
                    put in execution.</p>
                <p>The diſagreeable circumſtances in which Mary found herſelf involved by reaſon of
                    her quarrel with Elizabeth, the exceſſive bigotry and overbearing ſpirit of her
                    Proteſtant ſubjects, together with the adventure of Chatelard, and the calumnies
                    propagated in conſequence of it, determined her to think of a ſecond marriage.
                    Her beauty and expectations of the crown of England, joined to the kingdom which
                    ſhe already poſſeſſed, brought her many ſuitors. She was addreſſed by the king
                    of Sweden, the king of Navarre, the prince of Conde, the duke of Ferrara, Don
                    Carlos of Spain, the arch-duke Charles of Auſtria, and the duke of Anjou. Her
                    own inclination was to give the preference, among theſe illuſtrious lovers, to
                    the prince of Spain; but her determination, from the firſt moment, was to make
                    her wiſhes bend to other conſiderations, and to render her deciſion upon this
                    important point as agreeable as poſſible to queen Elizabeth, to the Engliſh
                    nation, and to the Proteſtants in both kingdoms. Her ſucceſſion to the crown of
                    England was the object neareſt her heart; and Elizabeth, who wiſhed to prevent
                    her from marrying altogether, contrived to impreſs upon her mind an opinion that
                    any foreign alliance would greatly obſtruct that much deſired event. She
                    therefore pitched upon two of her own ſubjects, whom ſhe ſucceſſively
                    recommended as fit matches for the queen of Scots; and ſhe promiſed, that upon
                    her acceptance of either of them, her right of inheritance ſhould be inquired
                    into and declared. Lord Robert Dudley, afterwards earl of Leiceſter, was the
                    firſt perſon propoſed; and except a manly face and fine figure he had not one
                    quality that could recommend him to the Scottiſh princeſs. Whilſt Mary received
                    this ſuitor with ſome degree of compoſure, ſhe did not altogether repreſs her
                    ſcorn. “She had heard good accounts (ſhe owned) of the gentleman; but as queen
                    Elizabeth had ſaid, that in propoſing a huſband to her, ſhe would conſult her
                    honour, ſhe aſked what honour there could be in marrying a ſubject The Engliſh
                    queen then brought under the eye of Mary another ſuitor, left her thoughts
                    ſhould return to a foreign alliance. This was lord Darnley, of the houſe of
                    Stuart itſelf, whoſe birth was alrnoſt equal to her own, and whom the Scottiſh
                    princeſs was induced to accept as a huſband by motives which we have detailed
                    elſewhere.</p>
                <p>(ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Mary.)</hi> Elizabeth however was not more ſincere in
                    this propoſal than in the former; for after permitting Darnley and his father
                    the earl of Lenox to viſit Scotland merely with the view of diverting the
                    attention of the Queen from the continent, ſhe threw every obſtacle in the way
                    of the marriage which art and violence could contrive. When ſhe found Mary ſo
                    much entangled, that ſhe could hardly draw back, or make any other choice than
                    that of Darnley, Elizabeth attempted to prevent her from going farther on; and
                    now intimated her diſapprobation of that marriage, which ſhe herſelf had not
                    only originally planned, but, in theſe latter ſtages, had forwarded by every
                    means in her power. The whole council of Elizabeth declared againſt the
                    marriage. Even from her own ſubjects Mary met with conſiderable oppoſition. An
                    inveterate enmity had taken place between the duke of Chatelherault and the earl
                    of Lenox, in conſequencc of which the former deſerted the court, and very few of
                    the Hamiltons repaired to it. The lord James Stuart, now earl of Murray, fought
                    to promote the match with lord Dudley, In conſequencc of this he was treated
                    openly with diſreſpect by the earl of Lenox; lie loſt the favour of his
                    ſovereign, and Darnley threatened him with his vengeance when he ſhould be
                    married to the queen. John Knox in the mean time behaved in the moſt furious
                    manner, forgetting not only the meek and peaceable behaviour of a Chriſtian, but
                    the allegiance of a ſubject. This preacher even interfered with the marriage of
                    his ſovereign. He warned the nobility, that if they allowed a Papiſt or an
                    infidel to obtain her perſon and the government of Scotland, they would be
                    guilty, to the full extent of their power, of baniſhing Jeſus Chriſt from the
                    kingdom, of bringing down upon it the vengeance of God, of being a curſe to
                    themſelves, and of depriving their queen of all comfort and conſolation. As
                    Darnley was a Papiſt, he was of conſequence execrated by the whole body of
                    Proteſtants, laity as well as clergy; while, on the other hand, he was ſupported
                    by the earls of Athol and Caithneſs, the lords Ruthven and Hume, and the whole
                    Popiſh faction.</p>
                <p>It was exceedingly unfortunate for the queen, that neither lord Darnley himſelf,
                    nor his father the earl of Lenox, had any talents for buſineſs; and as they
                    naturally had the direction of the queen’s affairs, it is no wonder that they
                    were very ill managed. But a ſource of oppoſition, more violent than any
                    imperfections of their own, roſe up to them in the attachment which they
                    diſcovered to a perſon upon whom the queen had of late beſtowed her favour with
                    an imprudent prodigality. David Rizzio from a mean origin raiſed himſelf to a
                    diſtinguiſhed eminence. He was born at Turin, where his father earned a
                    ſubſiſtence as a muſician. Varieties of ſituation and adventure, poverty, and
                    misfortunes, had taught him experience. In the train of the count de Morette,
                    the ambaſſador from the duke of Savoy, he had arrived in Scotland. The queen,
                    deſirous to complete her band of muſic, admitted him into her ſervice. In this
                    humble ſtation he had the dexterity to attract her attention; and her French
                    ſecretary falling into diſgrace, from negligence and incapacity, he was promoted
                    to diſcharge the duties of his office. A neceſſary and frequent admiſſion to her
                    company afforded him now the fulleſt opportunity to recommend himſelf to her;
                    and while ſhe approved his manners, ſhe was ſenſible of his fidelity and his
                    talents. His mind, however, was not ſufficiently vigorous to bear with ſucceſs
                    and proſperity. Ambition grew upon him with preferment. He<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0055.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0049"/> interfered in
                    affairs of moment, intruded himſelf into the conventions of the nobles at the
                    palace, and was candidate for greatneſs. The queen conſulted with him upon the
                    moſt difficult and important buſineſs, and intruſted him with real power. The
                    ſuppleneſs, ſervility, and unbounded complaiſance which had characteriſed his
                    former condition, were exchanged for inſolence, oſtentation, and pride. He
                    exceeded the moſt potent barons in the ſtatelineſs of his demeanour, the
                    ſumptuousneſs of his apparel, and the ſplendour of his retinue. The nobles,
                    while they deſpiſed the lowneſs of his birth, and deteſted him as a foreigner,
                    and a favourite, were mortified with his grandeur, and inſulted with his
                    arrogance. Their anger and abhorrence were driven into fury; and while this
                    undeſerving minion, to uphold his power, courted Darnley, and with officious
                    aſſiduities advanced his ſuit with the queen, he haſtened not only his own ruin,
                    but laid the foundation of cruel outrages and of public calamity.</p>
                <p>To the earl of Murray the exaltation of Rizzio, ſo oſſenſive in general to the
                    nation, was humiliating in a more particular degree. His interference for the
                    earl of Leiceſter, the partiality he entertained for Elizabeth, his connections
                    with ſecretary Cecil, and the favour he had ſhown to Knox, had all contributed
                    to create in Mary a ſuſpicion of his integrity. The practices of Darnley and
                    Rizzio were thence the more effectual; and the fulleſt weight of their influence
                    was employed to undermine his power. His paſſions and diſguſts were violent; and
                    in his mind he meditated revenge. Mary, aware of her critical ſituation, was
                    ſolicitous to add to her ſtrength. Bothwel, who had been impriſoned for
                    conſpiring againſt the life of the earl of Murray, and who had eſcaped from
                    confinement, was recalled from France; the earl of Sutherland, an exile in
                    Flanders, was invited home to receive his pardon; and George Gordon, the ſon of
                    the earl of Huntley, was admitted to favour, and was ſoon to be reinſtated in
                    the wealth and honours of his family.</p>
                <p>As ſoon as Bothwel arrived, the earl of Murray infilled that he ſhould be brought
                    to a trial for having plotted againſt his life, and for having broke from the
                    place of his confinement. This was agreed to; and on the day of trial Murray
                    made his appearance with 800 of his adherents. Bothwel did not chuſe to contend
                    with ſuch a formidable enemy; he therefore fled to France, and a proteſtation
                    was made, importing that his fear of violence had been the cauſe of his flight.
                    The queen commanded the judge not to pronounce ſentence. Murray complained
                    loudly of her partiality, and engaged deeper and deeper in cabals with queen
                    Elizabeth. Darnley, in the mean time, preſſed his ſuit with eagerneſs. The queen
                    uſed her utmoſt endeavours to cauſe Murray ſubſcribe a paper expreſſing a
                    conſent to her marriage; but all was to no purpoſe. However, many of the
                    nobility did ſubſcribe this paper; and ſhe ventured to ſummon a convention of
                    the eſtates at Stirling, to whom ſhe opened the buſineſs of the marriage; and
                    who approved of her choice, provided the Proteſtant religion ſhould continue to
                    be the eſtabliſhment.</p>
                <p>In the mean time ambaſſadors arrived from England, with a meſſage importing
                    Elizabeth’s entire diſapprobation and diſallowance of the queen’s marriage with
                    lord Darnley. But to theſe ambaſſadors Mary only replied, that matters were gone
                    too far to be recalled; and that Elizabeth had no ſolid cauſe of diſpleaſure,
                    ſince, by her advice, ſhe had fixed her affections not upon a foreigner, but
                    upon an Engliſhman; and ſince the perſon ſhe favoured was deſcended of a
                    diſtinguiſhed lineage, and could boaſt of having in his veins the royal blood of
                    both kingdoms. Immediately after this audience ſhe created lord Darnley a lord
                    and a knight. The oath of knighthood was adminiſtered to him. He was made a
                    baron and a banneret, and called <hi rend="italic">lord Armanagh,</hi> He was
                    belted earl of Roſs. He then promoted 14 gentlemen to the honour of knighthood,
                    and did homage to the queen, without any reſervation of duty to the crown of
                    England, where his family had for a long time reſided. His advancement to be
                    duke of Albany was delayed for a little time; and this was ſo much reſented by
                    him, that, when informed of it by the lord Ruthven, he threatened to ſtab that
                    nobleman with his dagger.</p>
                <p>In the mean time the day appointed for the aſſemblv of parliament, which was
                    finally to determine the ſubject of the marriage, was now approaching. The earl
                    of Murray, encouraged by the apparent firmneſs of Elizabeth, goaded on by
                    ambition, and alarmed with the approbation beſtowed by the convention of the
                    eſtates on the queen’s choice of lord Darnley, perceived that the moment was at
                    hand when a deciſive blow ſhould be ſtruck. To inſpirit the reſentments of his
                    friends, and to juſtify in ſome meaſure the violence of his projects, he
                    affected to be under apprehenſions of being aſſaſſinated by the lord Darnley.
                    His fears were founded abroad; and he avoided to go to Perth, where he affirmed
                    that the plot againſt him was to be carried into execution. He courted the
                    enemies of Darnley with unceaſing aſſiduity; and he united to him in a
                    confederacy the duke of Chatelherault, and the earls of Argyle, Rothes, and
                    Glencairn. It was not the ſole object of their aſſociation to oppoſe the
                    marriage. They engaged in more criminal enterpriſes. They meditated the death of
                    the earl of Lenox and the lord Darnley; and while the queen was upon the road to
                    Calander place to viſit the lord Livingſton, they propoſed to intercept her and
                    to hold her in captivity. In this ſtate of her humiliation, Murray was to
                    advance himſelf into the government of the kingdom, under the character of its
                    regent. But Mary having received intelligence of their conſpiracy, the earl of
                    Athol and the lord Ruthven raiſed ſuddenly 300 men to protect her in her
                    journey. Defeated in this ſcheme, the earl of Murray and his aſſociates did not
                    relinquiſh their cabals. They thought of new achievements; and the nation was
                    filled with alarms, ſuſpicions, and terror.</p>
                <p>Amidſt the arts employed by the Scottiſh malcontents to inflame the animoſities
                    of the nation, they forgot not to inſiſt upon the dangers which threatened the
                    Proteſtant religion from the advancement of lord Darnley, and from the rupture
                    that muſt enſue with England. Letters were everywhere diſperſed among the
                    faithful, reminding them of what the eternal God had wrought for them in the
                    abolition of idolatry, and admoniſhing them to oppoſe the reſtoration of the
                    maſs. A ſupplication was preſented to the queen, complaining of idolaters, and
                    inſiſting upon their puniſhment. In the preſent juncture of affairs it was
                    received with unuſual reſpect; and Mary inſtructed the Popiſh eccleſiaſtics
                        to<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0056.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0050"/> abſtain
                    from giving offence of any kind to the Proteſtants. A prieſt, however, having
                    celebrated the maſs, was taken by the brethren, and expoſed to the inſults and
                    fury of the populace at the market-place of Edinburgh, in the garments of his
                    proſeſſion, and with the chalice in his hand; and the queen having given a check
                    to this tumultuous proceeding, the Proteſtants, riling in their wrath, were the
                    more confirmed in the belief that ſhe meant to overthrow their religion. The
                    moſt learned and able of the clergy held frequent conſultations together; and
                    while the nation was diſturbed with dangerous ferments, the general aſſembly was
                    called to deliberate upon the affairs of the church. Their hope of ſucceſs being
                    proportioned to the difficulties in the ſituation of the queen, they were the
                    leſs ſcrupulous in forming their reſolutions; and the commiſſioners, whom they
                    deputed to her, were ordered to demand a parliamentary ratification of their
                    deſires.</p>
                <p>They inſiſted, that the maſs, with every remain what- ſoever of popery, ſhould be
                    univerſally ſuppreſſed throughout the kingdom; that in this reformation, the
                    queen’s perſon and houſehold ſhould be included; and that all Papiſts and
                    idolaters ſhould be puniſhed upon conviction according to the laws. They
                    contended, that perſons of every deſcription and degree ſhould reſort to the
                    churches upon Sunday, to join in prayers, and to attend to exhortations and
                    ſermons; that an independent proviſion ſhould be aſſigned for the ſupport of the
                    preſent clergy, and for their ſucceſſors; that all vacant benefices ſhould be
                    conferred upon perſons found to be qualified for the miniſtry, upon the trial
                    and examination of the ſuperintendants; that no biſhopric, abbey, priory,
                    deanery, or other living, having many churches, ſhould be bellowed upon a ſingle
                    perſon; but that, the plurality of the foundation being diſſolved, each church
                    ſhould be provided with a miniſter; that the glebes and manſes ſhould be
                    allotted for the reſidence of the miniſters, and for the reparation of churches;
                    that no charge in ſchools or univerſities, and no care of education, either
                    public or private, ſhould be intruſted to any perſon who was not ſound and abſe
                    in doctrine, and who was not approved by the ſuperintendants; that all lands
                    which of old had been devoted to hoſpitality, ſhould again be made ſubſervient
                    to it; that the lands and rents which formerly belonged to the monks of every
                    order, with the annuities, alterages, obits, and the other emoluments which had
                    appertained to prieſts, ſhould be employed in the maintenance of the poor and
                    the upholding of ſchools; that all horrible crimes, ſuch as idolatry, blaſphemy,
                    breaking of the ſabbath, witchcraft, ſorcery, inchantment, adultery, manifeſt
                    whoredom, the keeping of brothels, murder, and oppreſſion, ſhould be puniſhed
                    with ſeverity; that judges ſhould be appointed in every diſtrict, with powers to
                    pronounce ſentences and to execute them; and, in fine, that for the eaſe of the
                    labouring huſbandmen, ſome order ſhould be deviſed concerning a reaſonable
                    payment of the tythes.</p>
                <p>To theſe requiſitions, the queen made an anſwer full of moderation and humanity.
                    She was ready to agree with the three eſtates in eſtabliſhing the reformed
                    religion over the ſubjects of Scotland; and ſhe was ſteadily reſolved not to
                    throw into hazard the life, the peace, or the fortune, of any perſon whatſoever
                    upon account of his opinions As to herſelf and her houſehold, ſhe was</p>
                <p>perſuaded that her people would not urge her to adopt tenets in contradiction to
                    her own confidence, and thereby involve her in remorſe and uneafineſs. She had
                    been nourtſhed and brought up in the Romiſh faith; ſhe conceived it to be
                    founded on the word of God; and ſhe was deſirous to continue in it. But, ſetting
                    aſide her belief and religious duty, ſhe ventured to aſſure them, that ſhe was
                    convinced from political reaſons, that it was her intereſt to maintain herſelf
                    firm in the Roman Catholic perſuaſion. By departing from it, ſhe would forfeit
                    the amity of the king of France, and that of other princes who were now ſtrongly
                    attached to her; and their diſaffection could not be repaired or compenſated by
                    any new alliance. To her ſubjects ſhe left the fulleſt liberty of conſcience;
                    and they could not ſurely refuſe to their ſovereign the ſame right and
                    indulgence. With regard to the patronage of benefices, it was a prerogative and
                    property which it would ill become her to violate. Her neceſſities, and the
                    charge of her royal dignity, required her to retain in her hands the patrimony
                    of the crown. After the purpoſes, however, of her ſtation, and the exigences of
                    government, were ſatisfied, ſhe could not object to a ſpecial aſſignment of
                    revenue for the maintenance of the miniſtry; and, on the ſubject of the other
                    articles which had been submitted to her, ſhe was willing to be directed by the
                    three eſtates of the kingdom, and to concur in the reſolutions which ſhould
                    appear to them the moſt reaſonable and expedient.</p>
                <p>The clergy, in a new aſſembly or convention, expreſſed a high diſpleaſure with
                    this return to their addreſs. They took the liberty to inform the queen, that
                    the doctrines of the reformation which ſhe refuſed to adopt, were the religion
                    which had been revealed by Jeſus Chriſt, and taught by the apoſtles. Popery was
                    of all perſuaſions the leaſt alluring, and had the feweſt recommendations. In
                    antiquity, conſent of people, authority of princes, and number of proſelytes, it
                    was plainly inferior to Judaiſm. It did not even reſt upon a foundation ſo ſolid
                    as the doctrines of the alcoran. They required her, therefore, in the name of
                    the eternal God, to embrace the means of attaining the truth, which were offered
                    to her in the preaching of the word, or by the appointment of public
                    diſputations between them and their adverſaries. The terrors of the maſs were
                    placed before her in all their deformity. The ſayer of it, the action itſelf,
                    and the opinions expreffed in it, were all pronounced to be equally abominable.
                    To hear the maſs, or to gaze upon it, was to commit the complicated crimes of
                    ſacrilege, blaſphemy, and idolatry. Her delicacy in not renouncing her opinions
                    from the apprehenſion of offending the king of France and her other allies, they
                    ridiculed as impertinent in the higheſt degree. They told her, that the true
                    religion of Chriſt was the only means by which any confederacy could endure ;
                    and that it was far more precious than the alliance of any potentate whatſoever,
                    as it would bring to her the friendſhip of the King of kings. As to patronages,
                    being a portion of her patrimony, they intended not to defraud her of her
                    rights: but it was their judgment, that the ſuperintendants ought to make a
                    trial of the qualifications of candidates for the miniſtry; and as it was the
                    duty of the patron to preſent a perſon to the benefice, it was the buſineſs of
                    the church to manage his inſtitution or collation. For without this<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0057.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0051"/> reſtraint,
                    there would be no ſecurity for the fitneſs of the incumbent; and if no trials or
                    examinations of miniſters took place, the church would be filled with miſrule
                    and ignorance. Nor was it right or juſt that her majeſty ſhould retain to
                    herſelf any part of the revenue of benefices; as it ought to be all employed to
                    the uſes of the clergy, for the purpoſes of education, and for the ſupport of
                    the poor. And as to her opinion, that a ſuitable aſſignment ſhould be made for
                    them, they could not but thank her with reverence: but they begged to ſolicit
                    and importune her to condeſcend upon the particulars of a proper ſcheme for this
                    end, and to carry it into execution; and that, taking into a due conſideration
                    the other articles of their demands, ſhe would ſtudy to comply with them, and to
                    do juſtice to the religious eſtabliſhment of her people.</p>
                <p>From the fears of the people about their religion, diſturbances and inſurrections
                    were unavoidable; and before Mary had given her anſwer to the petitions or
                    addreſs of the clergy, the Proteſtants, to a formidable number, had marched to
                    St Leonard’s Craig; and, dividing themſelves into companies, had choſen captains
                    to command them. But the leaders of this tumult being apprehended and committed
                    to cloſe cuſtody, it ſubſided by degrees; and the queen, upon the interceſſion
                    of the magiſtrates of Edinburgh, inſtead of bringing them to trial, gave them a
                    free pardon. To quiet, at the ſame time, the apprehenſions which had gone
                    abroad, and to controvert the inſidious reports which had been induſtriouſly
                    ſpread of her inclination to overturn the reformed doctrines, ſhe repeatedly
                    iſſued proclamations, aſſuring her ſubjects, that it was her fixed determination
                    not to moleſt or diſturb any perſon whatſoever upon account of his religion or
                    conference; and that ſhe had never preſumed even to think of any innovation that
                    might endanger the tranquillity, or do a prejudice to the happineſs of the
                    commonwealth.</p>
                <p>While Mary was conducting her affairs with diſcernment and ability, the earl of
                    Murray and his confederates continued their conſultations and their intrigues.
                    After their diſappointment in the conſpiracy againſt the queen and the lord
                    Darnley, they perceived that their only hope of ſucceſs or ſecurity depended
                    upon Elizabeth; and as Randolph had promiſed them her protection and aſſiſtance,
                    they ſcrupled not to addreſs a letter to her, explaining their views and
                    ſituation. The pretences of their hoſtility to their ſovereign upon which they
                    affected to inſiſt, were her ſettled deſign to overturn the Proteſtant religion,
                    and her rooted deſire to break all correſpondence and amity with England. To
                    prevent the accompliſhment of theſe purpoſes, they ſaid, was the object of their
                    confederacy; and with her ſupport and aid they did not doubt of being able to
                    advance effectually the emolument and advantage of the two kingdoms. In the
                    preſent ſtate of their affairs, they applied not, however, for any ſupply of her
                    troops. An aid from her treaſury was now only neceſſary to them; and they
                    engaged to beſtow her bounty in the manner the moil agreeable to her
                    inclinations and her intereſts. The pleaſure with which Elizabeth received their
                    application was equal to the averſion ſhe had conceived againſt the queen of
                    Scots. She not only granted to them the relief they requeſted, but aſſured them
                    by Randolph of her eſteem and favour while they ſhould continue to uphold the
                    reformed religion and the</p>
                <p>connection of the two nations Flattered by her aſſurances and generoſity, they
                    were ſtrenuous to gain partizans, and to diſunite the friends of their
                    ſovereign; and while they were ſecretly preparing for rebellion, and for trying
                    their ſtrength in the field, they diſſeminated among the people the tenets, That
                    a Papiſt could not legally be their king; that the queen was not at liberty of
                    herſelf to make the choice of a huſband; and that, in a matter ſo weighty, ſhe
                    ought to be entirely directed by the determination of the three eſtates
                    aſſembled in parliament.</p>
                <p>Elizabeth, at the ſame time, carrying her diſſimulation to the moſt criminal
                    extremity, commanded Ran dolph to aſk an audience of Mary; and to counſel her to
                    nouriſh no ſuſpicions of the earl of Murray and his friends; to open her eyes to
                    their ſincerity and honour; and to call to mind, that as their lervices had
                    hitherto preſerved her kingdom in repoſe, her jealouſies of them might kindle it
                    into combuſtion, make the blood of her nobles to flow, and caſt into hazard her
                    perſon and her crown. Full of aſtoniſhment at a meſſage ſo rude and ſo improper,
                    the queen of Scots deſired him to inform his miſtreſs, that ſhe required not her
                    inſtructions to diſtinguiſh between patriotiſm and treachery; that ſhe was fully
                    ſenſible when her will or purpoſe was reſiſted or obeyed; and that ſhe poſſeſſed
                    a power which was more than ſufficient to repreſs and to puniſh the enormities
                    and the crimes of her ſubjects. The Engliſh reſident went now to the earl of
                    Lenox and the lord Darnley, and charged them to return to England. The former
                    expreſſed an apprehenſion of the ſeverity of his queen, and ſought an aſſurance
                    of her favour before he could venture to viſit her dominions. The latter,
                    exerting greater foritude, told him, that he acknowledged no duty or obedience
                    but to the queen of Scots. The reſident treating this anſwer as diſreſpectful to
                    Elizabeth, turned his back upon the lord Darnley, and retired without making any
                    reverence, or bidding him an adieu.</p>
                <p>The behaviour of Elizabeth, ſo fierce and ſo perfidious, was well calculated to
                    confirm all the intentions of Mary; and this, doubtleſs, was one of the motives
                    with which ſhe was actuated. But while the queen of Scots was eager to
                    accompliſh her marriage, ſhe was not inattentive to the riſing troubles of her
                    country. The parliament which ſhe had appointed could not now be held: it was
                    therefore prorogued to a more diſtant day; and the violence of the times did not
                    then permit it to aſſemble. By letters ſhe invited to her, with all their
                    retainers, the moſt powerful and the moſt eminent of her ſubjects. Bothwel was
                    recalled anew from France; and by general proclamations ſhe ſummoned to her
                    ſtandard the united force of her kingdom. The caſtle of Edinburgh was likewiſe
                    provided amply with ſtores and ammunition, that, in the event of misfortunes, it
                    might afford her a retreat and defence. The alacrity with which her ſubjects
                    flocked to her from every quarter, informed her of her power and popularity; and
                    while it ſtruck Murray and his adherents with the danger to which they were
                    expoſed, it declared to them the opinion entertained by the nation of the
                    iniquity and the ſelfiſhneſs of their proceedings.</p>
                <p>On the 29th of July 1565, the ceremony of marriage between the queen and lord
                    Darnley was performed. The latter had been previouſly created duke of<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0058.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0052"/> Albany. The
                    day before the marriage, a proclamation was publiſhed, commanding him to be
                    ſtyled <hi rend="italic">king of the realm,</hi> and that all letters after
                    their marriage ſhould be directed in the names of her huſband and herſelf. The
                    day alter it, a new proclamation was iſsued confirming this act: he was
                    pronounced king by the ſound of trumpets, and aſſociated with the queen in her
                    government. This meafure ſeems to have been the effect of the extreme love the
                    queen had for her huſband, which did not permit her to ſee that it was an
                    infringement of the conſtitution of the kingdom; though perhaps ſhe might alſo
                    be urged to it by the preſſing eagerneſs of lord Darnley himſelf, and the
                    partial counſels of David Rizzio. The earl of Murray made loud complaints,
                    remonſtrated, that a king was impoſed upon the nation without the conſent of the
                    three eſtates, and called upon the nation to arm againſt the beginnings of
                    tyranny. The malcontents accordingly were immediately in arms; but their ſucceſs
                    was not anſwerable to their wiſhes. The bulk of the nation were ſatisfied with
                    the good intentions of their ſovereign, and ſhe herſelf took the earlieſt
                    opportunity of cruſhing the rebellion in its infancy. The earl of Murray was
                    declared a traitor; and ſimilar ſteps were taken with others of the chiefs of
                    the rebels. She then took the field againſt them at the head of a conſiderable
                    army: and having driven them from place to place, obliged them at laſt to take
                    refuge in England. Queen Elizabeth received them with that duplicity for which
                    her conduct was ſo remarkable. Though ſhe herſelf had countenanced, and even
                    excited them to revolt, ſhe refilled to give an audience to their deputies. Nay,
                    ſhe even cauſed them to emit a public declaration, that neither ſhe, nor any
                    perſon in her name, had ever excited them to their rebellious practices. Yet,
                    while the public behaviour of Elizabeth was ſo acrimonious, ſhe afforded them a
                    ſecure tetreat in her kingdom, treated the earl of Murray in private with
                    reſpect and kindneſs, and commanded the earl of Bedford to ſupply him with
                    money. Mary, however, reſolved to proceed againſt the rebels with an exemplary
                    rigour. The ſubmiſſions of the duke of Chatel- herault alone, who had been leſs
                    criminal than the rest, were attended to. But even the favour which he obtained
                    was precarious and uncertain; for he was commanded to uſe the pretence of
                    ſickneſs, and to paſs for ſome time into foreign countries. A parliament was
                    called; and a ſummons of treaſon being executed againſt the earls of Argyle,
                    Glencairn, and Rothes, with others</p>
                <p>of the principal rebels, they were commanded to appear before the three eſtates;
                    in default of which their lives and eſtates were declared to be forfeited.</p>
                <p>In the mean time Throgmorton the Engliſh ambaſſador ſolicited the pardon of the
                    rebels; which Mary was at firſt inclined to grant. However, by the perſuaſion of
                    the court of France, ſhe was not only induced to proceed againſt them with
                    rigour, but acceded to the treaty of Bayonne, by which the deſtruction of the
                    Proteſtants was determined. This meaſure filled the whole court with terror and
                    diſmay. The rebels were acquainted with the danger of their ſituation; and being
                    now driven deſperate, they were ready to engage in the moſt atrocious deſigns.
                    Unhappily, the ſituation of affairs in Scotland rendered the accompliſhment of
                    their purpoſes but too eaſy. Violent diſguſts had taken place between the queen
                    and her huſband. Her fondneſs had been exceſſive; but ſhe ſoon perceived that
                    the qualities of his mind were not proportioned to his perſonal accompliſhments.
                    He was proud, diſdainful, and ſuſpicious. No perſuaſions could correct his
                    wilfulneſs; and he was at the ſame time giddy and obſtinate, inſolent and mean.
                    The queen in conſequence began to ſhow an indifference towards him; which he
                    took care to augment, by ſhowing the like indifference towards her, and engaging
                    in low intrigues and amours, indulging himſelf in diſſipation and riot, amp;c.
                    However, the deſire of dominion was his ruling paſſion; and. the queen, finding
                    his total incapacity for exerciſing his power to any good purpoſe, had excluded
                    him from it altogether. He was therefore at preſent a proper object for the
                    machinations of the rebels, and readily entered into an agreement with them to
                    depoſe the queen; vainly thinking by that means that he ſhould ſecure the crown
                    to himſelf. However, as the parliament was ſoon to aſſemble, in which the rebels
                    had every reaſon to believe that they would be condemned for high treaſon, it
                    was neceſſary that the kingdom ſhould be thrown into diſorder before that time
                    came, otherwiſe their fate was inevitable. Practiſing on the imbecillity of
                    Darnley, they perſuaded him that a criminal correſpondence ſubſiſted between the
                    queen and David Rizzio<note anchored="true" n="6" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(r)</hi> That there ſubſiſted a
                            criminal intercourſe between Mary and Rizzio is a ſcandal wſhrch is now
                            given up by her enemies. It ſeems to reft on the authority of Buchanan
                            and Knox; and their evidence in this cafe is clearly of no weight, not
                            only from their being the ſtrenuous partizans of her adverſaries, but
                            from the multitude of ſalſehoods which they anxiouſly detail to
                            calumniate her. The love ſhe felt for Darnley was extreme, and their
                            acquaintance commenced a month or two after the appointment of Rizzio to
                            be her ſecretary for French affairs. She became pregnant ſoon after her
                            marriage; and it was during her pregnancy that Rizzio was aſſaſſinated.
                            There are ſtriking preſumptions in her favour. And what ſeems to put her
                            innocence out of all queſtion, is the ſilence of the ſpies and reſidents
                            of Elizabeth with regard to this amour; for, if there had been any thing
                            real in it, they could not have made their court to their queen more
                            effectually than by declaring to her its peculiarities; and their want
                            of delicacy, ſo obſervable in other circumſtances, would have induced
                            them upon this occaſion to give the greateſt foulnels and deformity to
                            their information.</p><p>It appears that Rizzio was ill-favoured, and of
                            a diſagreeable form. Buchanan ſays of him, "Non faciem cultus
                            hor.eſtabat, ſed facies cultum deſtruebat. Hiſt. Scot. lib. xvii. This
                            expreſſion is very ſtrong; but it would have little weight if other
                            authors had not concurred in giving a ſimilar deſcription of Rizzio. In
                            a book <pb n="53"/> intitled, “Le Livre de la Morte de la Reyne
                            d’Ecoſſe,” and printed in the year 1587, he is ſaid to be “diſgracie de
                            corps.” Cauſſin, ap. Jebb, p. 37. This work, too, while it records the
                            unkindneſs of nature to his perſon, has obſerved, that he was in his old
                            age when he made a figure in the court of Mary. “Elle traittoit
                            ordinairement avec David Rſecio ſon ſecretaire, homme aagé et prudent,
                            qui poſſedoit ſon oreille.” Ibid. And other authors give their
                            teſtimonies to the ſame purpoſe.</p><p>It is probable that the
                            panegyriſts of Mary exaggerate ſomewhat the imperfections as well as the
                            good qualities of Rizzio. But there ſeems in general to be no reaſon to
                            doubt his fidelity and talents, any more than his uglineſs and ſenility.
                            He had therefore a better title to be her ſecretary than her lover. It
                            is an abſurdity to think that a queen ſo young and beautiful would yield
                            herſelf to deformity and old age. A common proſtitute muſt be brought to
                            endure this misfortune. The capacity of the man was a recommendation to
                            him; and as he owed every thing to her bounty, and was a ſtranger, ſhe
                            had the greateſt reaſon to rely upon his faithfulneſs. The
                            perſidiouſneſs and duplicity of her courtiers drew cloſer the tie of
                            their connection; and as Rizzio was ſtudious to make himſelf agreeable,
                            and was ſkilful in games of hazard, he was always ready to be a party
                            with her in thoſe innocent amuſements which fill up the liſtleſs
                            intervals of life. Keith. Append, p. 124.</p></note>
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">(r).</hi> For this reaſon the king reſolved upon his
                    deſtruction; and the conſpirators hoped thereby not only to get an indemnity to
                    themſelves, but to effect a total revolution at court, and the entire
                    humiliation of Bothwel, Huntley, and Athol, who were the aſſociates of Rizzio.
                    However, in order to ſave them-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0059.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0053"/> ſelves, they engaged the king to ſubſcribe a
                    bond, affirming that the project of aſſaſſmating Rizzio was altogether of his
                    own deviſing; acknowledging that he had ſolicited them to take a part in it,
                    from the apprehenſions that reſiſtance might be made to him; and agreeing, upon
                    the word and honour of a prince, to protect and ſecure them againſt every hazard
                    and injury to which they might be expoſed from the atchievement of his enter
                    priſe. Having procured this ſecurity, and having allured the earl of Lenox the
                    king’s father to approve their meaſures, they adjuſted the method of the
                    projected murder; and diſpatched a meſſenger to the Engliſh frontier,
                    advertiſing the earl of Murray and the rebels of their intentions, and inviting
                    them to return to the court.</p>
                <p>Upon the 9th day of March, about 7 o’clock in the evening, armed men, to the
                    number of 500, ſurrounded the palace of Holyroodhouſe. The earl of Morton and
                    the Lord Lindſay entered the court of the palace, with 160 perſons. The queen
                    was in her chamber at ſupper, having in her preſence her natural filter the
                    counteſs of Argyle, her natural brother Robert commendator of Holyroodhouſe,
                    Beton of Creicſh matter of the houſehold, Arthur Erſkine, and David Rizzio. The
                    king entering the apartment, ſeated himſelf by her fide. He was followed by the
                    Lord Ruthven, who being waſted with ſickneſs, and caſed in armour, exhibited an
                    appearance that was hideous and terrible. Four ruffians attended him. In a
                    hollow voice he commanded Rizzio to leave a place which did not become him. The
                    queen, in aſtoniſhment and conſternation, applied to the king to unfold to her
                    this myſterious enterprise. He affected ignorance. She ordered Ruthven from her
                    preſence, under the pain of treaſon; declaring to him at the ſame time, that if
                    Rizzio had committed any crime, ſhe would produce him before the parliament, and
                    puniſh him according to the laws. Ruthven drawing his dagger, advanced towards
                    Rizzio. The queen roſe to make an exertion of her authority. The unfortunate
                    ſtrangcr laid hold of her garments, crying out for juſtice and mercy. Other
                    conſpirators ruſhing into the chamber, overturned the table, and increaſed the
                    diſmay and confuſion. Loaded piſtols were preſented to the boſom of the queen.
                    The king held her in his arms. George Douglas, Hatching the dagger of his
                    ſovereign, plunged it into the body of Rizzio. The wounded and ſcreaming victim
                    was dragged into the antichamber; and ſo eager were the aſſaſſins to complete
                    their work, that he was torn and mangled with 56 wounds.</p>
                <p>While the queen was preſſing the king to gratify her inquiries into the meaning
                    of a deed ſo execrable, Ruthven returned into their preſence. She gave a full
                    vent to indignation and reproach. Ruthven, with an intolerable coldneſs and
                    deliberation, informed her, that Rizzio had been put to death by the counſel of
                    her huſband, whom he had diſhonoured; and that by the perſuaſion of this minion
                    ſhe had refuſed the crown-matrimonial to the king, had engaged to re-eſtabliſh
                    the ancient religion, had reſolved to puniſh the earl of Murray and his friends,
                    and had entruſted her confidence to Bothwel and Huntley, who were traitors. The
                    king, taking the part of Ruthven, remonſtrated againſt her proceedings, and
                    complained that from the time of her familiarity with Rizzio, ſhe had neither
                    regarded, nor entertained, nor truſted him. His ſuſpicions and ingratitude
                    ſhocked and tortured her. His connection with the conſpirators gave her an
                    ominous anxiety. Apprehenſions of outrages ſtill more atrocious invaded her. In
                    theſe agitated and miſerable moments ſhe did not loſe herſelf in the
                    helpleſſneſs of ſorrow. The loftineſs of her ſpirit communicated relief to her;
                    and wiping away her tears, ſhe exclaimed, that it was not now a ſeaſon for
                    lamentation, but for revenge.</p>
                <p>The earls of Huntley, Bothwel, and Athol, the lords Fleming and Levingſton, and
                    Sir James Balfour, who were obnoxious to the conſpirators, and at this time in
                    the palace, found all reſiſtance to be vain. Some of them eluding the vigilance
                    of Morton, made their eſcape; and others were allowed to retire. The provoſt and
                    magiſtrates of Edinburgh getting intelligence of the tumult, ordered the alarm
                    bell to be rung. The citizens, apprehenſive and anxious, approached in crowds to
                    inquire into the welfare of their ſovereign; but ſhe was not permitted to
                    addreſs herſelf to them. The conſpirators told her, that if ſhe preſumed to make
                    any harangue, they would “cut her in pieces, and caſt her over the walls.” The
                    king called to the people that ſhe was well, and commanded them to diſperſe. The
                    queen was ſhut up in her chamber, uncertain of her fate, and without the
                    conſolation or attendance of her women.</p>
                <p>In the morning a proclamation was iſſued by the king, without the knowledge of
                    his queen, prohibiting the meeting of the parliament, and ordering the members
                    to retire from the city. The rebellious lords now<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0060.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0054"/> returned from
                    England, and arrived at Edinburgh within 24 hours after the aſſaſſination of
                    Rizzio. The queen, knowing of how much conſequence it was for her to gain the
                    earl of Murray, invited him to wait upon her. Notwithſtanding the extreme
                    provocation which ſhe had met with, Mary ſo far commanded her paſſions, that ſhe
                    gave him a favourable reception. After informing him of the rudeneſs and
                    ſeverity of the treatment ſhe had met with, the queen obſerved, that if he had
                    remained in friendſhip with her at home, he would have protected her againſt
                    ſuch exceſſes of hardſhip and inſult. Murray, with an hypocritical compaſſion,
                    ſhed abundance of tears; while the queen ſeemed to entertain no doubt of his
                    ſincerity, but gave him room to hope for a full pardon of all his offences. In
                    the mean time, however, the conſpirators held frequent conſultations together,
                    in which it was debated, whether they ſhould hold the queen in perpetual
                    captivity, or put her to death; or whether they ſhould content themſelves with
                    committing her to cloſe cuſtody in Stirling caſtle till they ſhould obtain a
                    parliamentary ſanction to their proceedings, eſtabliſh the Proteſtant religion
                    by the total overthrow of the mats, and inveſt the king with the
                    crown-matrimonial and the govern ment of the kingdom.</p>
                <p>Mary now began to perceive the full extent of her wretchedneſs; and therefore, as
                    her laſt reſource, applied to the king, whom ſhe treated with all thoſe
                    blandiſhments uſually employed by the fair ſex when they want to gain the
                    aſcendency over the other. The king, who, with all his faults, had a natural
                    facility of temper, was eaſily gained over. The conſpirators were alarmed at his
                    coldneſs, and endeavoured to fill his mind with fears concerning the duplicity
                    of his wife; but, finding they could not gain their point, they at laſt began to
                    treat of an accommodation. The king brought them a meſſage, importing, that Mary
                    was diſpoſed to bury in oblivion all memory of their tranſgreſſions; and he
                    offered to conduct them into her preſence. The earls of Murray and Morton, with
                    the lord Ruthven, attended him into her preſence; and, falling on their knees
                    before the queen, made their apologies and ſubmiſſions. She commanded them to
                    riſe; and having deſired them to recollect her abhorrence of cruelty and
                    rapaciouſneſs, ſhe aſſured them with a gracious air, that inſtead of deſigning
                    to forfeit their lives, and poſſeſs herſelf of their eſtates, ſhe was inclined
                    to receive them into favour, and to give a full pardon, not only to the nobles
                    who had come from England, but to thoſe who had aſſaſſinated David Rizzio. They
                    were accordingly ordered to prepare the bonds for their ſecurity and
                    forgiveneſs, which the queen promiſed to take the earlieſt opportunity of
                    ſubſcribing; but in the mean time the king obſerved, that the conſpirators ought
                    to remove the guards which they had placed around the queen, that all ſuſpicion
                    of reſtraint might be taken away. This meaſure could not with any propriety be
                    oppoſed, and the guards were therefore diſmiſſed; upon which the queen, that
                    very night, left her palace at midnight, and took the road to Dunbar,
                    accompanied by the king and a few attendants.</p>
                <p>The news of the queen’s eſcape threw the conſpirators into the utmoſt
                    conſternation; as ſhe immediately iſſued proclamations for her ſubjects to
                    attend her in arms, and was powerfully ſupported. They ſent there</p>
                <p>fore the lord Semple, requeſting, with the utmoſt humility, her ſubſcription to
                    their deeds of pardon and ſecurity; but to this meſſage ſhe returned an
                    unfavourable anſwer, and advanced towards Edinburgh with an army of 8000 men.
                    The conſpirators now fled with the utmoſt precipitation. Even John Knox retired
                    to Kyle till the ſtorm ſhould blow over. On the queen’s arrival at Edinburgh, a
                    privy council was inſtantly called, in which the conſpirators were charged to
                    appear as guilty of murder and treaſon; their places of ſtrength were ordered to
                    be rendered up to the officers of the crown; and their eſtates and poſſeſſions
                    were made liable to confiſcation and forfeiture.</p>
                <p>But while the queen was thus eager to puniſh the conſpirators, ſhe was ſenſible
                    that ſo many of the nobility, by uniting in a common cauſe, might raiſe a
                    powerful party in oppoſition to her; for which reaſon ſhe endeavoured to detach
                    the earl of Murray from the reſt, by making him offers of pardon. Sir James
                    Melvil accordingly pledged himſelf to produce his pardon and that of his
                    adherents, it he would ſeparate from Morton and the conſpirators. He accordingly
                    became cold and diſtant to them, and exclaimed againſt the murder as a moſt
                    execrable action; but notwithſtanding his affected anger, when the conſpirators
                    fled to England, he furniſhed them with letters of recommendation to the earl of
                    Bedford. After the flight of the conſpirators, the king thought it neceſſary for
                    him to deny his having any ſhare in the action. He therefore embraced an
                    opportunity of declaring to the privy council his total ignorance of the
                    conſpiracy againſt Rizzio; and not ſatisfied with this, he, by public
                    proclamations at the market-place of his capital, and over the whole kingdom,
                    proteſted to the people at large that he had never bellowed upon it, in any
                    degree, the ſanction of his command, conſent, alliſtance, or approbation.</p>
                <p>In the mean time the queen granted a full and ample pardon to the earls ot
                    Murray, Argyle, Glencairn, and Rothes, and their adherents; but towards the
                    conſpirators ſhe remained inexorable. This lenity, to Murray eſpecially, proved
                    a ſource of the greateſt inquietude to the queen; for this nobleman, blind to
                    every motive of action diſtinct from his own ambition, began to contrive new
                    plots, which, though dilappointed for a time, ſoon operated to the deſtruction
                    of the queen, and almoſt to the ruin of the nation.</p>
                <p>In 1566, the queen was delivered oſ a prince, who received the name of <hi
                        rend="italic">James.</hi> This happy event, however, did not extinguiſh the
                    quarrel betwixt her and the king. His deſire to intrude himſelf into her
                    authority, and to fix a ſtain upon her honour, his ſhare in the murder of
                    Rizzio, and his extreme meanneſs in publicly denying it afterwards, could not
                    fail to impreſs her with the ſtrongeſt ſentiments of deteſtation and contempt.
                    Unable, however, totally to diveſt herſelf of regard for him, her behaviour,
                    though cold and diſtant, was yet decent and reſpectful. Caſtelnau, at this time
                    ambaſſador extraordinary from France, conceived that a reconciliation might be
                    effected, and employed himſelf ſome time in this friendly office. Nor were his
                    endeavours altogether ineffectual. The king and queen ſpent two nights together;
                    and proceeded, in company with each other, to Meggatland in Tweeddale in order
                    to enjoy the diveriion of the chace, attended by the earls of Huntley, Bothwel,
                    Murray, and other nobles. From<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0061.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0055"/> thence they paſſed to Edinburgh, and then took
                    the road to Stirling. Had the king been endowed with any prudence, he would have
                    made the belt uſe of this opportunity to have regained the affections of his
                    queen; but, inſtead of this, finding that he was not immediately intruſted with
                    power, his peeviſhneſs ſuggeſted to him a deſign of going abroad. To Monſieur du
                    Croc, the French reſident, who had attended Mary at Stirling, he ventured to
                    communicate his chimerical project. This ſtateſman repreſented to him its
                    wildneſs and inefficacy; and could hardly believe that he was ſerious. To his
                    father the earl of Lenox, who paid him a viſit at this place immediately upon
                    Mary’s departure from it, he likewiſe communicated his intention; and all the
                    intreaties, arguments, and remonſtrances of this nobleman to make him drop his
                    deſign, were without ſucceſs. He provided a veſſel, and kept it in readineſs to
                    carry him from his dominions. The earl of Lenox, after returning to Glaſgow,
                    where he uſually reſided, gave way to his paternal anxieties, and ſolicited the
                    queen by letter to interfere with her authority and perſuaſions; and upon the
                    evening of the day in which ſhe received this diſpatch, the king alighted at
                    Holyroodhouſe. But the names of the nobles who were with the queen being
                    announced to him, he objected to three of them, and inſiſted that they ſhould be
                    ordered to depart, before he would enter within the gates of the palace. The
                    queen, alarmed with a demeanour ſo rude and ſo unwarrantable, condeſcended to
                    leave her company and her palace to meet him; and it was with great difficulty
                    that ſhe was able to entice him into her own apartment. There he remained with
                    her during the night. She communicated to him his father’s letter, and employed
                    every art and blandiſhment to engage him to explain his perverſe deſign. But he
                    gave her no return or ſatisfaction. He was unmoved with her kindneſs; and his
                    ſilence, dejection, and peeviſhneſs, augmented her diſtreſs. In the morning, ſhe
                    called her privy council to aſſemble in the palace, and invited to her Monſieur
                    du Croc the French envoy. By the biſhop of Roſs ſhe explained the intention of
                    the king, and made known the diſpatch of the earl of Lenox. The privy council
                    were urgent to know the reaſons of a voyage that appeared to them ſo
                    inexplicable; and earneſtly preſſed the king to unboſom himſelf. If his
                    reſolution proceeded from diſcontent, and if there were perſons in the kingdom
                    who had given him cauſes of offence, they aſſured him, that they were ready,
                    upon his information, to take the neceſſary ſteps to make him eaſy and happy. No
                    quality or rank ſhould exempt thoſe from inquiry and puniſhment who had
                    committed miſdemeanors againſt him. This, they ſaid, conſiſted with his honour,
                    with the honour of the queen, and with their own. If, however, he had received
                    no ſuſſicient provocation to juſtify his behaviour, and if he had no title to
                    complain of actual injuries, they admoniſhed him to remember, that his flight
                    from a queen ſo beautiful, and from a kingdom ſo ancient and noble, would expoſe
                    him to the greateſt ridicule and diſgrace. They pointed out the happineſs of his
                    fortune, and counſelled him not to part lightly with all its flattering
                    advantages. The queen herſelf, taking his hand into her’s, and preſſing it with
                    affection, beſought him to ſay by what act or deed ſhe had unfortunately induced
                    him to conceive ſo fatal a purpoſe. Her memory did</p>
                <p>not reproach her with any crime or indiſcretion which affected his honor or her
                    integrity: yet if, without any deſign upon her part, ſhe had incurred his
                    diſpleaſure, ſhe was diſpoſed to atone for it; and ſhe begged him to ſpeak with
                    entire freedom, and not in any degree to ſpare her. Monſieur du Croc then
                    addreffed him, and employed his intereſt and perſuaſions to make him reveal his
                    inquietudes. But all this reſpectful attention and ceremonious duty were
                    ineffectual. Obſtinately froward, he refuſed to confeſs that he intended any
                    voyage, and made no mention of any reaſons of diſcontent. He yet acknowledged
                    with readineſs, that he could not with juſtice accuſe the queen of any injury or
                    offence. Oppreſſed with uneaſineſs and perturbation, he prepared to retire; and,
                    turning to her, ſaid, “Adieu, Madam! you ſhall not ſee me for a long time.” He
                    then bowed to the French envoy, and to the lords of the privy council.</p>
                <p>He haſtened back to Stirling, leaving the queen and her council in ſurpriſe and
                    aſtoniſhment. They reſolved to watch his motions with anxiety, and could not
                    conjecture what ſtep he would take. Mary, to prevent the effect of rumours to
                    her diſadvantage, diſpatched a courier to advertiſe the king of France and the
                    queen- mother of his conduct. It was not poſſible that a prince ſo meanly
                    endowed with ability could make any impreſſion upon her allies. Nor did it
                    appear to be in his power to excite any domeſtic inſurrection or diſturbance. He
                    was univerſally odious; and, at this time, the queen was in the higheſt
                    eſtimation with the great body of her ſubjects. After paſſing ſome days at
                    Stirling, he addreſſed a letter to the queen, in which, after hinting at his
                    deſign of going abroad, he inſinuated his reaſons of complaint. He was not
                    truſted by her with authority, and ſhe was no longer ſtudious to advance him to
                    honour. He was without attendants; arid the nobility had deſerted him. Her
                    anſwer was ſenſible and temperate. She called to his remembrance the
                    diſtinctions ſhe had conferred upon him, the ules to which he had put the credit
                    and reputation accruing from them, and the heinous offences he had encouraged in
                    her ſubjects. Though the plotters againſt Rizzio had repreſented him as the
                    leader of their enterprize, ſhe had yet abſtained ſrom any accuſation of him,
                    and had even behaved as if ſhe believed not his participation in the. guilt of
                    that project. As to the defects of his retinue, ſhe had uniformly offered him
                    the attendance of her own ſervants. As to the nobility, they were the ſupports
                    of the throne, and independent of it. Their countenance was not to be commanded,
                    but won. He had diſcovered too much ſtatelineſs to them; and they were the
                    proper judges of the deportment that became them. If he wiſhed for conſequence,
                    it was his duty to pay them court and attention; and whenever he ſhould procure
                    and conciliate their regard and commendation, ſhe would be happy to give him all
                    the importance that belonged to him.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the earls of Murray and Bothwel were induſtriouſly ſtriving to
                    widen the breach between the king and queen, and at the ſame time to foment the
                    diviſion between the king and his nobles. The earl of Morton excited
                    diſturbances on the borders; and as no ſettled peace had taken place there ſince
                    Mary’s marriage, there was the greateſt reaſon to believe that he would ſucceed
                    in his attempts. Pro-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0062.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0056"/> clamations were therefore iſſued by the queen to
                    call her ſubjects to arms; and ſhe proceeded to Jedburgh, to hold
                    juſtice-courts, and to puniſh traitors and diſorderly perſons. In the courſe of
                    this journey ſhe was taken dangerouſly ill; inſomuch that, believing her death
                    to be at hand, ſhe called for the biſhop of Roſs, telling him to bear witneſs,
                    that ſhe had perſevered in that religion in which ſhe had been nouriſhed and
                    brought up; taking the promiſe of her nobles, that after her death they would
                    open her laſt will and teſtament, and pay the reſpect to it that conſiſted with
                    the laws; recommending to them the rights of her infant ſon, and the charge of
                    educating him in ſuch a manner as might enable him to rule the kingdom of his
                    anceſtors with honour; and intreating them to abſtain from all cruelty and
                    perſecution of her Roman Catholic ſubjects. Not- withſtanding her apprehenſions,
                    however, and the extreme violence of her diſtemper, the queen at laſt recovered
                    perfect health. As ſoon as ſhe was able to travel, ſhe viſited Kelſo, Werk
                    caille, Hume, Langton, and Wedderburn. The licentious borderers, on the firſt
                    news of her recovery, laid down their arms. Being deſirous to take a view of
                    Berwick, the queen advanced to it with an attendance of 1000 horſe. Sir John
                    Forſter, the deputy warden of the Engliſh marches, came forth with a numerous
                    retinue, and conducted her to the moſt proper ſtation for ſurveying it, and paid
                    her all the honours in his power, by a full diſcharge of the artillery, and
                    other demonſtrations of joy. Continuing her journey, ſhe paſſed to Eymouth,
                    Dunbar, and Tantallon; proceeding thence to Craigmillar caſtle, where ſhe
                    propoſed to remain till the time of the baptiſm of the prince, which was ſoon to
                    be celebrated at Stirling.</p>
                <p>During the ſevere ſickneſs of the queen, her huſband kept himſelf at a diſtance:
                    but when ſhe was ſo far recovered as to be out of danger, he made his
                    appearance; and being received with ſome coldneſs and formality, he retired
                    ſuddenly to Stirling. This cruel neglect was a moſt ſenſible mortification to
                    her; and while ſhe ſuffered from his ingratitude and haughtineſs, ſhe was not
                    without ſuſpicions that he was attempting to diſturb the tranquillity of her
                    government. She was ſeized with a ſettled melancholy; and, in her anguiſh, often
                    wiſhed for death to put a period to her exiſtence. Her nobles, who were
                    caballing againſt her, remarked her condition, and took advantage of it.
                    Bothwel, who had already recommended himſelf by his ſervſees, redoubled his
                    efforts to heighten the favour which theſe ſervices had induced her to conceive
                    for him. At this time, it is probable, he ſought to gain the affection of the
                    queen, with a view to marry her himſelf, providing a divorce from her huſband
                    could be obtained, which was now become the ſubject of conſultation by Murray
                    and his aſſociates. After much deliberation, the queen herſelf was acquainted
                    with this project; and it was told her, that provided ſhe would pardon the earl
                    of Morton and his aſſociates, the means ſhould be found of effectuating the
                    divorce. This was urged as a matter of ſtate by the earls of Murray, Lethington,
                    Argyle, and Huntley; and the queen was invited to conſider it as an affair which
                    might be managed without any interference on her part. The queen replied, that
                    ſhe would liſten to them, upon condition that the divorce could be ob</p>
                <p>tained according to the laws, and that it ſhould not be any way prejudicial to
                    her ſon: but if they meant to operate their purpoſe by a diſregard to theſe
                    points, they muſt not think any more of it; for rather than conſent to their
                    views, ſhe would endure all the torments, and abide by all the perils, to which
                    her ſituation expoſed her.</p>
                <p>Lethington upon this, in the name of the reſt, engaged to make her quit of her
                    huſband, without prejudice to her ſon; words which could not be underſtood
                    otherwiſe than as pointing at murder. Lord Murray (added he), who is here
                    preſent, ſcrupulous as he is, will connive; and behold our proceedings without
                    opening his lips. The queen immediately made anſwer, “I deſire that you will do
                    nothing from which any ſtain may be fixed upon my honour or conſcience; and I
                    therefore require the matter to reſt as it is, till God of his goodneſs ſend
                    relief: What you think to be of ſervice to me may turn out to my diſpleafure and
                    harm.”</p>
                <p>It appears, however, that from this moment a plot was formed by Murray, Bothwel,
                    and Lethington, againſt the life of Darnley, and by ſome of them probably
                    againſt the queen herſelf; and that Morton, who with the other conſpirators
                    againſt Rizzio had received a pardon, was cloſely aſſociated with them in their
                    nefarious deſigns. That profligate peer was, in his way to Scotland, met at
                    Whittingham by Bothwel and the ſecretary. They propoſed to him the murder of the
                    king, and required his aſſiſtance, alleging that the queen herſelf conſented to
                    the deed; to which Mot ton by his own account replied, that he was diſpoſed to
                    concur, provided he were ſure of acting under any authority from her; but
                    Bothwel and Lethington having returned to Edinburgh, on purpoſe to obtain ſuch
                    an authority, ſent him back a meſſage, That the queen would not permit any
                    conversation upon that matter.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, preparations were made for the baptiſm of the young prince; to
                    aſſiſt at which the queen left Craigmillar and went to Stirling. The ceremony
                    was performed on the 17th of December 1566. After the baptiſmal rites were
                    performed, the name and titles of the prince were three times proclaimed by the
                    heralds to the found of trumpets. He was called and deſigned, Charles James,
                    James Charles, prince and Steward of Scotland, duke of Rotheſay, earl of
                    Carrick, lord of the Iſles, and baron of Renfrew. Amidſt the ſcenes of joy
                    diſplayed on this occaſion, the king ſhowed his folly more than he had done
                    before. As Elizabeth did not mean to acknowledge him in his ſovereign capacity,
                    it was neither conſiſtent with the dignity of the queen, nor his own, that he
                    ſhould be preſent at the baptiſm. He did not indeed preſent himſelf either at
                    the ceremony or the entertainments and maſquerades with which it was
                    accompanied. At this juncture, however, though he had often kept at a greater
                    diſtance before, he took up his residence at Stirling, as if he had meant to
                    offend the queen, and to expoſe their quarrels to the world. Du Croc, who was
                    inclined to be favourable to him, was ſo ſtruck with the impropriety of his
                    behaviour, that he affected to have inſtructions from France to avoid all
                    intercourſe with him: and when the king propoſed to pay him a viſit, he took the
                    liberty to inform him, that there were two paſſages in his chamber; and that if
                        his<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0063.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0057"/>
                    majeſty ſhould enter by the one, he ſhould be conſtrained to go out by the
                    other.</p>
                <p>While he reſided at Stirling, the king chiefly confined himſelf to his chamber.
                    His ſtrange behaviour to the queen did not give the public any favourable idea
                    of him; and as the earl of Murray and his faction took care to augment the
                    general odium, no court was paid to him by foreign ambaſſadors. His ſituation,
                    therefore, was exceedingly uncomfortable; but though he muſt have been conſcious
                    of his imprudence and folly, he did not alter his conduct. In a ſullen humour he
                    left Stirling, and proceeded to Glaſgow. Here he fell ſick, with ſuch ſymptoms
                    as ſeemed to indicate poiſon. He was tormented with violent pains, and his body
                    was all covered over with puſtules of a bluiſh colour; ſo that his death was
                    daily expected. Mary did not repay his coldneſs to her by negligence. She ſet
                    out immediately for Glaſgow, and waited on him with all the aſſiduity of an
                    affectionate wife, until he recovered: after which ſhe returned with him to
                    Edinburgh; and as the low ſituation of the palace of Holyroodhouſe was thought
                    to render it unhealthy, the king was lodged in a houſe which had been appointed
                    for the ſuperior of the church, called <hi rend="italic">St Mary's in the
                        Fields.</hi> This houſe ſtood upon an high ground, and in a ſalubrious air;
                    and here ſhe ſtaid with him ſome days. — Here the conſpirators thought proper to
                    finiſh their plot in the moil execrable manner. On the 10th of February 1567,
                    about two o’clock in the morning, the houſe where the king reſided was blown up
                    by gunpowder. The exploſion alarming the inhabitants, excited a general
                    curioſity, and brought multitudes to the place from whence it proceeded. The
                    king was found dead and naked in an adjoining field, with a fervant who uſed to
                    ſleep in the ſame apartment with him. On neither was there any mark of fire or
                    other external injury.</p>
                <p>The queen was in the palace of Holyroodhouſe, taking the diverſion of a walked
                    ball, which was given to honour the marriage of a favourite domeſtic, when the
                    news of the king’s death was brought to her. She ſhowed the utmoſt grief, and
                    appeared exaſperated to the laſt degree againſt the perpetrators of a deed at
                    once ſo ſhocking and barbarous. The moil expreſs and peremptory orders were
                    given to inquire after the perpetrators by every poſſible method. A proclamation
                    was iſſued by the privy-council, aſſuring the people, that the queen and
                    nobility would leave nothing undone to diſcover the murderers of the king. It
                    offered the firm of 2000 l. and an annuity for life, to any perſon who ſhould
                    give information of the deviſers, counſellors, and perpetrators of the murder;
                    and it held out this reward, and the promiſe of a full pardon, to the
                    conſpirator who ſhould make a free confeſſion of his own guilt, and that of the
                    confederates. On the fourth day after this proclamation was publiſhed, a placard
                    was affixed to the gate of the city-priſon, affirming, that the earl of Bothwel,
                    James Balfour, David Chalmers, and black John Spence, were the murderers. No
                    name, however, was ſubſcribed to this intelligence, nor was any demand made for
                    the proffered reward; ſo that it was difficult to know whether this
                    advertiſement had been dictated by a ſpirit of calumny or the love <hi
                        rend="italic">of</hi> juſtice.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the earl of Murray conducted</p>
                <p>himſelf with his uſual circumſpection and artifice. Upon a pretence that his wife
                    was dangerouſly ſick at his caſtle in Fife, he, the day before the murder,
                    obtained the queen’s permiſſion to pay a viſit to her. By this means he propoſed
                    to prevent all ſuſpicion whatever of his guilt. He was ſo full, however, of the
                    intended project, that while he was proceeding on his journey, he obſerved to
                    the perſen who accompanied him, “This night, before morning, the lord Darnley
                    ſhall loſe his life.” When the blow was ſtruck, he returned to Edinburgh to
                    carry on his practices. Among foreign nations <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> the
                    domeſtic disputes of the queen and her huſband being fully known, it was with
                    the greater eaſe that reports could be propagated to her diſadvantage. To France
                    letters were diſpatched, expreſſing, in fervent terms, her participation in the
                    murder. In England, the miniſters and courtiers of Elizabeth could not flatter
                    that princeſs more agreeably, than by induſtriouſly detracting from the honour
                    and the virtue of the Scottiſh queen. Within her own dominions a ſimilar ſpirit
                    of outrage exerted itſelſ, and not without ſucceſs. As her reconciliation with
                    her huſband could not be unknown to her own ſubjects, it was interpreted to be
                    diſſimulation and treachery. The Proteſtant clergy, who were her moſt determined
                    enemies, poſſeſſed a leading direction among the populace; and they were the
                    friends and the partizans of the earl of Murray. Open declamations from the
                    pulpit were made againſt Bothwel, and ſtrong inſinuations and biting ſurmiſes
                    were thrown out againſt the queen. Papers were diſperſed, making her a party
                    with Bothwel in the murder. Every art was employed to provoke the frenzy of the
                    people. Voices, interrupting the ſilence of the night, proclaimed the infamy of
                    Bothwel; and portraits of the regicides were circulated over the kingdom.</p>
                <p>The queen’s determination, however, to ſcrutinize into the matter was unabated;
                    and to the earl of Lennox, the king’s father, ſhe paid an attention which he
                    could only have expected from her upon an emergency of this kind. Having preſſed
                    her by letter to the moſt diligent inquiry after the regicides, ſhe returned an
                    anſwer ſo completely to his wiſhes, that he: was fully convinced of the
                    ſincerity and rigour with which ſhe intended to proceed againſt them: and he
                    urged her to aſſemble the three eſtates, that their advice might direct the
                    order and manner of their trial. She wrote to him, that an aſſembly of the
                    eſtates was already proclaimed; and that it was her earneſt and determined will
                    and purpoſe, that no ſtep ſhould be neglected that could conduce to the
                    advancement and execution of juſtice. Yielding to his anxieties, he addreſſed
                    her anew, intreating that the trial might not be delayed; obſerving, that it was
                    not a matter of parliamentary inquiry; adviſing, that it would be more proper to
                    proceed to it with the greateſt expedition and urging her to commit to priſon
                    all the perſons who had been named and deſcribed in the papers and placards
                    which had been ſet up in the public places of the city. The queen informed him,
                    that although ſhe had thought it expedient to call a meeting of the parliament
                    at this juncture, it was not her meaning that the proceedings againſt the
                    regicides ſhould be delayed till it was actually aſſembled. As to the placards
                    and papers to which he alluded, they were ſo numerous and contradictory,<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0064.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0058"/> that ſhe
                    could not well determine upon which to act: but it he would condeſcend to
                    mention the names which, in his opinion, were moſt ſuſpicious, ſhe would
                    inſtantly command that thoſe ſteps ſhould be taken which the laws directed and
                    authoriſed. He in return named the earl of Bothwel, James Balfour, David
                    Chalmers, black John Spence, Francis Sebaſtian, John de Burdeaux, and Joſeph the
                    brother of David Rizzio; and aſſured her majeſty, that his ſuſpicions of theſe
                    perſons were weighty and ſtrong. In reply to his information, Mary gave him her
                    ſolemn promiſe, that the perſons he had pointed out ſhould abide and undergo
                    their trial in conformity to the laws, and that they ſhould be puniſhed
                    according to the meaſure of their guilt: and ſhe invited him to leave
                    immediately his retirement, and to meet her at her court, that he might witneſs
                    the proceedings againſt them, and the zeal with which ſhe was animated to
                    perform the part that became her.</p>
                <p>While the queen carried on this correſpondence with the earl of Lenox, ſhe
                    reſided partly at the palace of the lord Seton, at the diſtance of a few miles
                    from her capital, and partly at Holyroodhouſe. By the time that ſhe ſent her
                    invitation to him, ſhe was reſiding in her capital. She delayed not to confer
                    with her counſellors, and to lay before them the letters of the earl of Lenox.
                    Bothwel was earneſt in his proteſtations of innocence; and he even expreſſed his
                    wiſh for a trial, that he might eſtabliſh his integrity. No facts pointed to his
                    guilt; there had appeared no accuſer but the earl of Lenox; and no witneſſes had
                    been found who could eſtabliſh his criminality. Her privy-council ſeemed to her
                    to be firmly perſuaded that he was ſuffering under the malice of defamation.
                    Murray, Morton, and Lethington, whatever might be their private machinations,
                    were publicly his moſt ſtrenuous defenders; and they explained the behaviour of
                    the earl of Lenox to be the effect of hatred and jealouſy againſt a nobleman who
                    had outrun him ſo far in the career of ambition. But though all the arts of
                    Murray and Bothwel, Morton and Lethington, were exerted to their utmoſt extent
                    to miſlead the queen, they were not able to withhold her from adopting the
                    ſtrain of conduct which was the moſt proper and the moſt honourable to her. It
                    was her own ardent deſire that the regicides ſhould be puniſhed; ſhe had given
                    her ſolemn promiſe to the earl of Lenox, that the perſons whom he ſuſpected
                    ſhould be proſecuted; and amidſt all the appearances in favour of Bothwel, and
                    all the influence employed to ſerve him, it is to be regarded as a ſtriking
                    proof of her honour, vigour, and ability, that ſhe could accompliſh this
                    meaſure. An order, accordingly, of the privy-council was made, which directed,
                    that the earl of Bothwel, and all the perſons named by Lenox, ſhould be brought
                    to trial for the murder of the king, and that the laws of the land ſhould be
                    carried into full execution. The 12th of April was appointed for the trial. A
                    general invitation was given to all perſons whatſoever to prefer their
                    accuſations. The earl of Lenox was formally cited to do himſelf juſtice, by
                    appearing in the high court of juſticiary, and by coming forward to make known
                    the guilt of the culprits.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, it was proper to repreſs that ſpirit of outrage that had
                    manifeſted itſelf againſt the</p>
                <p>queen. No diſcoveries, however, were made, except againſt James Murray, brother
                    to Sir William Murray of Tullibardin, who at different times had publiſhed
                    placards injurious to her. He was charged to appear before the privy-council:
                    but refuſing to obey its citation, it was made a capital offence for any
                    commander of a veſſel to convey him out of the kingdom; and the reſolution was
                    taken to puniſh him with an exemplary ſeverity. Effecting, however, his eſcape,
                    he avoided the puniſhment due to his repeated and deteſtable acts of calumny and
                    treaſon.</p>
                <p>The day for the trial of Bothwel approached. The conſpirators, notwithſtanding
                    their power, were not without apprehenſions. Their preparations, however, for
                    their ſafety had been anxious; and, among other practices, they neglected not to
                    attempt to throw a panic into the earl of Lenox. They were favoured by his
                    conſciouſneſs of his unpopularity, and his want of ſtrength, by his timidity and
                    his ſpirit of jealouſy, Suſpicions of the queen’s guilt were inſinuated into
                    him; and the dangers to which he might be expoſed by inſiſting on the trial were
                    ſet before him in the ſtrongeſt colours. He was ſenſible of her averſion to him;
                    and his weakneſs and the ſovereign authority were contraſted. His friends
                    concurred with his enemies to intimidate him, from the ſpirit of flattery, or
                    from a real belief that his ſituation was critical. By the time he had reached
                    Stirling, in his way to Edinburgh, his fears predominated. He made a full ſtop,
                    He was no longer in haſte to proceed againſt the regicides. He addreſſed a
                    letter to the queen, in which he ſaid he had fallen into ſuch ſickneſs, that he
                    could not travel; and he affirmed, that he had not time to prepare for the trial
                    and to aſſemble his friends. He complained, too, that Bothwel and his
                    accomplices had not been committed to cuſtody; he inſiſted, that this ſtep
                    ſhould be taken; and he requeſted, that a day at a greater diſtance might be
                    appointed for the trial. After the lengths to which mattere had gone, this
                    conduct was moſt improper; and it is only to be accounted for from terror or
                    capriciouſneſs. His indiſpoſition was affected; he had been invited by Mary to
                    wait upon her at Edinburgh at an early period, to concert his meaſures; and the
                    delay he aſked was in ſtrong contradiction to his former intreaties. After the
                    invitation ſent to him, he might have relied with ſafety upon the protection of
                    the queen, without any gathering of his friends; from the time of her private
                    intimation to him, and of the legal citations of her officers, there had paſſed
                    a period more than ſufficient for the purpoſe of calling them together; and
                    indeed to ſuppoſe that there was any neceſſity for their aſſiſtance; was an
                    inſult to government, and a matter of high indecency. There was more juſtice in
                    the complaint, that the earl of Bothwel and his accomplices had not been taken
                    into cuſtody; and yet even in this peculiarity, he was himſelf to blame in a
                    great degree. For he had not obſerved the precaution of that previous diſplay of
                    evidence, known in the Scottiſh law under the term of a precognition, which is
                    common in all the groſſer offences, and which the weighty circumſtances of the
                    preſent caſe rendered ſo neceſſary as a foundation for the confinement and
                    conviction of the criminals-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0065.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0059"/> An application for the delay of a trial ſo
                    important, upon the night immediately preceding the day ſtated for it, and
                    reciting reaſons of no concluſive force, could not with propriety be attended
                    to. The privy-council refuſed the demand of the earl of Lenox. The court of
                    juſticiary was aſſembled. The earl of Argyle acted in his character of lord high
                    juſticiar; and was aided by four aſſeſſors, Robert Pitcairn, commendator of
                    Dunfermline, and the lord Lindſay, with Mr James Macgill and Mr Henry Balnaves,
                    two lords of the ſeſſion. The indictment was read, and the earls of Bothwel and
                    Lennox were called upon; the one as the defender, the other as the accuſer.
                    Bothwel, who had come to the court with an attendance of his vaſſals, and a band
                    of mercenary ſoldiers, did not fail to preſent himſelf: but Lenox appeared only
                    by his ſervant Robert Cunnyngham; who, after apologizing for his abſence, from
                    the ſhortneſs of the time, and the want of the preſence of his friends, deſired
                    that a new day ſhould be appointed for the trial; and proteſted, that if the
                    jury ſhould now enter upon the buſineſs, they ſhould incur the guilt of a wilful
                    error, and their verdict be of no force or authority.</p>
                <p>This remonſtrance and proteſtation appeared not to the court of ſufficient
                    importance to interrupt the trial. They paid a greater reſpect to the letters ol
                    the earl of Lenox to the queen inliſting upon an immediate proſecution, and to
                    the order of the privy-council conſequent upon them. The jury, who conſiſted of
                    men of rank and condition, after conſidering and reaſoning upon the indictment
                    for a conſiderable time, were unanimous in acquitting Bothwel of all ſhare and
                    knowledge of the king’s murder. The machinations however of Morton, which we
                    have mentioned in the life of <hi rend="smallcaps">Mary,</hi> were ſo apparent,
                    that the earl of Caithneſs, the chancellor of the aſſize, made a declaration in
                    their name and his own, that no wilful error ought to be imputed to them for
                    their verdict; no proof, vouchers, or evidence, to confirm or ſupport the
                    criminal charge having been ſubmſtted to them. At the ſame time, he offered a
                    proteſtation for himſelf, that there was a miſtake in the indictment, the 9th
                    day of February inſtead of the 10th being expreſſed in it as the date of the
                    murder. It is not to be doubted, but that this flaw in the indictment was a
                    matter of deſign, and with a view to the advantage of Bothwel, if the earl of
                    Lenox had made his appearance againſt him. And it has been remarked as moſt
                    indecent and ſuſpſicous, that ſoldiers in arms ſhould have accompanied him to
                    the court of juſtice; that during the trial, the earl of Morton ſtood by his
                    ſide to give him countenance and to aſſiſt him; and that the four aſſeſſors to
                    the chief juſticiar were warm and ſtrenuous friends to the earl of Murray.</p>
                <p>Immediately after his trial, Bothwel ſet up in a conſpicuous place a writing,
                    ſubſcribed by him, challenging to ſingle combat, any perſon of equal rank with
                    himſelf, who ſhould dare to affirm that he was guilty of the king’s murder. To
                    this challenge an anſwer was publiſhed, in which the defiance was accepted, upon
                    the condition that ſecurity ſhould be given for a fair and equal conflict: but
                    no name being ſubſcribed to this paper, it was not underſtood to correſpond with
                    the law of arms; and of conſequence no ſtep was</p>
                <p>taken for the fighting of the duel. <hi rend="smallcaps">Two</hi> days after the
                    parliament met, and there the party of Bothwel appeared equally formidable. The
                    verdict in his favour was allowed to be true and juſt. He was continued in his
                    high offices; and obtained a parliamentary ratification of the place of keeper
                    of Dunbar caſtle, with the eſtates in connection with it; and other favours were
                    conferred upon Murray, with the reſt of the nobles ſuſpected as accomplices in
                    the murder.</p>
                <p>A very ſhort time after the final acquitment of Bothwel, he began to give a
                    greater looſe to his ambition, and conceived hopes of gaining the queen in
                    marriage. It has been already remarked, that he had inſidiouſly endeavoured to
                    gain her affection during the lifetime of her huſband; but though he might have
                    ſucceeded in this, the recent death of the king in ſuch a ſhocking manner, and
                    the ſtrong ſuſpicions which muſt neceſſarily ſtill reſt upon him,
                    notwithſtanding the trial he had undergone, neceſſarily prevented him from
                    making his addreſſes openly to het. He therefore endeavoured to gain the
                    nobility over to his ſide; which having done one by one, by means of great
                    promiſes, he invited them to an entertainment, where they agreed to ratify a
                    deed pointing him out to the queen as a perſon worthy of her hand, and
                    expreſſing their reſolute determination to ſupport him in his pretenſions. This
                    extraordinary bond was accordingly executed; and Murray’s name was the firſt in
                    the lift of ſubſcribers, in order to decoy others to ſign after him; but that he
                    might appear innocent of what he knew was to follow, he had, before any uſe was
                    made of the bond, aſked and obtained the queen’s permiſſion to go to France. In
                    his way thither he viſited the court of Elizabeth, where he did not fail to
                    confirm all the reports which had ariſen to the diſadvantage of Mary; and he now
                    circulated the intelligence that ſhe was ſoon to be married to Bothwel. Her
                    partizans in England were exceedingly alarmed; and even queen Elizabeth herſelſ
                    addreſſed a letter to her, in which ſhe cautioned her not to afford ſuch a
                    miſchievous handle to the malice of her enemies.</p>
                <p>Mary, upon the diſſolution of the parliament, had gone to Stirling to viſit the
                    young prince. Bothwel, aimed with the bond of the nobles, aſſembled 1000 horle,
                    under the pretence of protecting the borders, of which he was the warden; and
                    meeting her upon her return to her capital, dilmiſſed her attendants, and
                    carried her to his caſtle of Dunbar. The arts which he uſed there to effect the
                    accompliſhment of his wiſhes we have mentioned under another article, (fee <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Mary).</hi> But having been married only ſix months before
                    to Lady Jane Gordon, ſiſter to the earl of Huntley, it was neceſſary to procure
                    a divorce before he could marry the queen. This was eaſily obtained. The parties
                    were couſins within the prohibited degrees, and had not obtained a diſpenſation
                    from Rome. Their marriage, therefore, in the opinion of the queen and her Roman
                    Catholic ſubjects, was illicit, and a profane mockery of the ſacrament of the
                    church. The huſband had alſo been unfaithful; ſo that two actions of divorce
                    were inſtituted. The lady commenced a ſuit againſt him in the court of the
                    commiſſaries, charging him as guilty of adultery with one of her maids. The earl
                    himſelf brought a ſuit againſt his wife before the court of the archbiſhop of St
                    Andrew's, upon the plea of conſan-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0066.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0060"/> guinity. By both courts their marriage was
                    decided to be void; and thus two ſentences of divorce were pronounced.</p>
                <p>Bothwel now conducted the queen from Dunbar to her capital. But inſtead of
                    attending her to her palace of Holyrood houſe, his jealouſy and apprehenſions
                    induced him to lodge her in the caſtle of Edinburgh, where he could hold her in
                    ſecurity againſt any attempt of his enemies. To give ſatisfaction, however, to
                    her people, and to convince them that ſhe was no longer a priſoner, a public
                    declaration upon her part appeared to be a meaſure of expediency. She preſented
                    herſelf, therefore, in the court of ſeſſion; the lords chancellor and preſident,
                    the judges, and other perlons of diſtinction, being preſent. After obſerving
                    that ſome ſtop had been put to the adminiſtration of juſtice upon account of her
                    being detained at Dunbar againſt her will by the lord Bothwel, ſhe declared,
                    that though ſhe had been highly offended with the outrage offered to her, ſhe
                    was yet inclined to forget it. His courteouſneſs, the ſenſe ſhe entertained of
                    his paſt ſervices to the ſtate, and the hope with which ſhe was impreſſed of his
                    zeal and activity for the future, compelled her to give him and his accomplices
                    in her impriſonment a full and complete pardon. She at the ſame time deſired
                    them to take notice, that ſhe was now at her freedom and liberty; and that ſhe
                    propoſed, in conſideration of his merits, to take an early opportunity of
                    promoting him to new and diſtinguiſhed honours.</p>
                <p>It was underſtood that the queen was immediately to advance him to be her
                    huſband. The order was given for the proclamation of the banns; and Mr John
                    Craig, one of the miniſters of Edinburgh, was deſired to perform this buſineſs.
                    But though the order was ſubſcribed by the queen, he refuſed abſolutely his
                    compliance without the authority of the church. The brethren, after long
                    reaſonings, granted him permiſſion to diſcharge this duty. His ſcruples,
                    notwithſtanding, and delicacy, were not yet removed. He proteſted, that, in
                    obeying their deſire, he ſhould be allowed to ſpeak his own ſentiments
                    concerning the marriage, and that his publiſhing the banns ſhould infer no
                    obligation in him to officiate in the ſolemnſty. In his congregation,
                    accordingly, before a crowded audience, and in the preſence of ſeveral noblemen
                    and privy counſellors, he declared that the marriage of the queen and the earl
                    of Bothwel was unlawful, and that he was prepared to give his reaſons for this
                    opinion to the parties themſelves. He added, that if leave to do this was denied
                    Him, he would either abſtain altogether from proclaiming the banns, or take the
                    liberty, after proclaiming them, to inform his people of the cauſes of his
                    diſapprobation of the marriage. He was carried before the lords of the
                    privy-council ; and the earl of Bothwel called upon him to explain his
                    behaviour. He anſwered, that the church had prohibited the marriage of perſons
                    ſeparated for adultery; and that the divorce between him and his wife muſt have
                    been owing to colluſion; ſince the ſentence had been given with precipitation,
                    and ſince his new contract was ſo ſudden; and he objected to him the abduction
                    and raviſhment <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the queen, and the ſuſpicion of his
                    guilt in the king’s murder. This bold language drew no reply from Bothwel that
                    was ſatislactory to Mr Craig, or that could intimidate him. He proclaimed in his
                    church the banns of the marriage; but he told the congregation, that he
                    diſcharged the ſuggeſtions of his conference in pronouncing it to be a
                    deteſtable and ſcandalous engagement. He expreſſed the ſorrow he felt for the
                    conduct of the nobility, who ſeemed to approve it from their flattery or
                    ſilence; and addreſſing himſelf to the faithful, he beſought them to pray to the
                    Almighty that he would turn a reſolution intended againſt law, reaſon, and
                    religion, into a comfort and benefit to the church and the kingdom. Theſe
                    freedoms were too great to paſs unnoticed. Mr Craig was ordered anew to attend
                    the privy-council; and he was reprimanded with ſeverity for exceeding the bounds
                    of his commiſſion. He had the courage to defend himſelf. His commiſſion, he
                    ſaid, was founded in the word oſ God, poſitive law, and natural reaſon; and upon
                    the foundation of theſe topics he was about to prove that the marriage muſt be
                    univerſally foul and odious, when the earl of Bothwel commanded him to be
                    filent. The privy-council, ſtruck with the vigour of the man, and apprehenſive
                    of the public diſeontents, did not dare to inflict any puniſhment upon him; and
                    this victory, over Bothwel, while it heightened all the ſuſpicions againſt him,
                    ſerved to encourage the enemies of the queen, and to undermine the reſpect of
                    her ſubjects.</p>
                <p>Mary, before ſhe rendered her hand to Bothwel, created him duke of Orkney. The
                    ceremony was performed in a private manner, after the rules of the Popiſh
                    church; but, to gratify the people, it was likewiſe ſolemnized publicly
                    according to the Proteſtant rites by Adam Bothwel biſhop of Orkney, an
                    eccleſiaſtic who had renounced the Epiſeopal order, for the reformation. It was
                    celebrated with little pomp and feſtivity. Many of the nobles had retired to
                    their feats in the country; and thoſe who attended were thoughtful and ſad. Du
                    Croc, the French ambaſſador, ſenſιble that the match would be diſpleaſing to his
                    court, refuſed to give his countenance to the lolemnity. There were no
                    acclamations of the common people. Mary herſelf was not inconſcious of the
                    imprudence of the choice ſhe had made, and looked back with ſtupriſe and ſorrow
                    to the train of circumſtances which had conducted her to this fatal event.
                    Forſaken by her nobles, arid impriſoned at Dunbar, ſhe was in ſo perilous a
                    ſituation that no remedy could ſave her honour but death. Her marriage was the
                    immediate and neceſſary conſequence of that ſituation<note anchored="true" n="7"

                            great authority, in our hiſtory, this topic is touched with no leſs
                            exactneſs, but with greater delicacy. After Mary had remained a
                            fortnight under the power of a daring profligate adventurer, ſays Lord

                            Some of her ſubjects might ſtill have ſought that honour; but her
                            compliance would have been humiliating beyond meaſure. It would have
                            left her at the mercy of a capricious huſhand; it would have expoſed her
                            to the diſgrace of being reproached, in ſome ſullen hour, for the
                            adventure at Dunbar. Mary was ſo ſituated, at this critical period, that
                            ſhe was reduced to this horrid alternative, either to remain in a
                            friendleſs and hazardous celibacy, or to yield her hand to Bothweh”

                        the<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0067.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0061"/> point
                    for which her enemies had laboured with a wicked and relentleſs policy.</p>
                <p>Mary was unfortunate in her ſecond marriage, but much more ſo in her third.
                    Bothwel had neither talents for buſineſs nor affection for his wife. Ambitious
                    and jealous to the laſt degree, he ſought only to eſtabliſh himſelf in power,
                    while his fears and jealouſies made him take the moſt improper means. The
                    marriage had already thrown the nation into a ferment; and the leaſt improper
                    exerciſe of power, or indeed an appearance of it, even on the part of the queen,
                    would be ſufficient to ruin them both for ever. Perhaps the only thing which at
                    this juncture could have pacified the people, would have been the total
                    abolition of Popery, which they had often required. But this was not thought of.
                    Inſtead of taking any ſtep to pleaſe the people, Bothwel endeavoured to force
                    the earl of Marre to deliver up the young prince to his cuſtody.— This was
                    ſuſſicient to make the flame, which had hitherto been ſmothered, break out with
                    all its violence. It was univerſally believed that Bothwel, who had been the
                    murderer of the father, deſigned to take away the life of the ſon alſo, and the
                    queen was thought to participate in all his crimes. The earl of Murray now took
                    advantage of the queen’s unfortunate ſituation to aggrandize himſelf and effect
                    her ruin. After having viſited the Engliſh court, he proceeded to France, where
                    he aſſiduouſly diſſeminated all the reports againſt the queen which were
                    injurious to her reputation; and where, without being expoſed to ſuſpicion, he
                    was able to maintain a cloſe correſpondence with his friends Morton and
                    Lethington, and to inſpirit their machinations. His aſſociates, true to his
                    ambition and their own, had promoted all the ſchemes of Bothwel upon the queen
                    with a power and influence which had inſured their ſucceſs. In confederacy with
                    the earl of Murray himſelf, they had conſpired with him to murder the king.
                    Aſſiſted with the weight of the earl of Murray, they had managed his trial, and
                    operated the verdict which acquitted him. By the ſame arts, and with the ſame
                    views, they had joined with him to procure the bond of the nobles recommending
                    him to the queen as a huſband, aſſerting his integrity and innocence, recounting
                    his noble qualities, expreſſing an unalterable reſolution to ſupport the
                    marriage againſt every oppoſer and adversary, and recording a wiſh that a
                    defection from its objects and purpoſes ſhould be branded with everlaſting
                    ignominy, and held out as a moſt faithleſs and perjured treachery. When the end,
                    however, was accompliſhed for which they had been ſo zealous, and when the
                    marriage of the queen was actually celebrated, they laid aſide the pretence of
                    frſendſhip, and were in haſte to entitle themſelves to the ignominy which they
                    had invited to fall upon them. The murder of the king, the guilt of Bothwel, his
                    acquittal, his divorce, and his marriage, became the topics of their complaints
                    and declamation. Upon the foundation of this hated</p>
                <p>marriage, they even ventured privately to infer the privity of the queen to all
                    his iniquity and tranſactions; and this ſtep ſeemed doubtleſs, to the maſs of
                    her own ſubjects and to more diſtant obſervers, a ſtrong confirmation of all the
                    former ſuſpicions to her ſhame which had been circulated with ſo much artifice.
                    Their imputations and devices excited againſt her, both at home and abroad, the
                    moſt indignant and humiliating odium. Amidſt the ruins of her fame, they thought
                    to bury for ever her tranquillity and peace; and in the convuiſions they had
                    meditated, they already were anticipating the downfal of Bothwel, and ſnatching
                    at the crown that tottered on her head.</p>
                <p>But while this cabal were proſecuting their private ends, ſeveral noblemen, not
                    leſs remarkable for their virtue than their rank, were eager to vindicate the
                    national integrity and honour. The earl of Athol, upon the king’s murder, had
                    retired ſrom the court, and was waiting for a proper ſeaſon to take revenge upon
                    the regicides. The earl of Marre, uneaſy under the charge of the young prince,
                    was ſolicitous to make himſelf ſtrong, that he might guard him from injury.
                    Motives ſo patriotic and. honourable drew applauſe and partizans. It was
                    ſufficient to mention them. By private conference and debate, an association was
                    inſenſibly formed to puniſh the murderers of the king, and to protect the perſon
                    of the prince. Morton and Lethington encouraged and promoted a combination from
                    which they might derive ſo much advantage. A convention accordingly was
                    appointed at Stirling, for the purpoſe oſ conſulting upon the meaſures which it
                    was moſt expedient to purſue, They agreed to take an early opportunity to appear
                    in the field; and when they ſeparated, it was to collect their retainers, and to
                    inſpirit their paſſions.</p>
                <p>Of this confederacy, the leading men were the earls of Argylc, Athol, Morton,
                    Marre, and Glencairn; the lords Hume, Semple, and Lindſay; the barons Kirkaldy
                    of Grange, Murray of Tullibardin, and Maitland oſ Lethington. The earl of
                    Bothwel was ſenſible, that if he was to ſit upon a throne, he muſt wade to it
                    through blood. By his advice, two proclamations were iſſued in the name of the
                    queen, under the pretence of ſuppreſſing inſurrections and depredations upon the
                    borders. By the former, ſhe called together in arms, upon an early day, the
                    earls, barons, and freeholders of the diſtricts of Forfar and Perth, Strathern
                    and Menteith, Clackmannan, Kinroſs, and Fife. By the latter ſhe charged the
                    greater and leſſer baronage, with all the inferior proprietors oſ the ſhires of
                    Linlithgow and Edinburgh, and the conſtabulary of Haddington and Berwick, to
                    prepare immediately for war, and to kecp themſelves in readineſs to march upon
                    her order. Theſe military preparations admoniſhed the aſſociation to be firm and
                    active, and added to the public, inquietudes and diſeontents. The rumours
                    againſt the queen were moſt violent and lourd. It was ſaid, that ſhe meant to<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0068.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0062"/> to overturn
                    the conſtitution and the laws; that ſhe had been careleſs of the health of her
                    ſon, and was altogether indifferent about his preſervation; that ſhe had
                    ſeparated herſelf from the councils and aſſiſtance of her nobles; and that ſhe
                    wiſhed to make her whim or diſcretion the only rule of her government. Agitated
                    with the hazardous ſtate of her affairs, ſhe publiſhed a new proclamation, in
                    which ſhe employed herſelf to refute theſe acccuſations; and in which ſhe took
                    the opportunity to expreſs, in a very forcible manner, not only her attachment
                    to her people and the laws, but the fond affection that ſhe bore to the prince,
                    whom ſhe conſidered as the chief joy of her life, and without whom all her days
                    would be comfortleſs.</p>
                <p>The declarations of the queen were treated with ſcorn. The nobles, abounding in
                    vaſſals, and having the hearts of the people, were ſoon in a ſituation to take
                    the field. They were advancing to the capital. The royal army was not yet
                    aſſembled; and the queen and Bothwel ſuſpected that the caſtle of Edinburgh
                    would ſhut its gates upon them. The fidelity of Sir James Balfour the
                    deputy-governor had been ſtaggered by the practices of the earl of Marre and Sir
                    James Melvil. Mary left her palace of Holyroodhouſe, and was conducted to
                    Borthwick caſtle. The aſſociated lords, informed of her flight, took the road to
                    this fortreſs with 2000 horſe. The lord Hume, by a rapid march, preſented
                    himſelf before it with the diviſion under his command: but being unable to guard
                    all its avenues, the queen and Bothwel effected their eſcape to Dunbar; where
                    the ſtrength of the fortifications gave them a full ſecurity againſt a
                    ſurpriſe.</p>
                <p>Upon this ſecond diſappointment, the nobles reſolved to enter Edinburgh, and to
                    augment their ſtrength by new partizans. The earl of Huntley and the lord Boyd
                    were here on the ſide of the queen, with the arch- biſhop of St Andrew’s, the
                    biſhop of Roſs, and the abbot of Kilwinning. They endeavoured to animate the
                    inhabitants to defend their town and the cauſe of their ſovereign. But the tide
                    of popularity was favourable to the confederated lords. The magiſtrates ordered
                    the gates of the city to be ſhut; but no farther reſiſtance was intended. The
                    lords, forcing St Mary’s port, found an eaſy admittance, and took poſſeſſion of
                    the capital. The earl of Huntley and the queen’s friends fled to the caſtle, to
                    Sir James Balfour, who had been the confident of Bothwel, and who agreed to
                    protect them, although he was now concluding a treaty with the inſurgents.</p>
                <p>The aſſociated lords now formed themſelves into a council, and circulated a
                    proclamation. By this paper they declared, that the queen being detained in
                    captivity, was neither able to govern her realm, nor to command a proper trial
                    to be taken of the king’s murder. In an emergency ſo preſſing, they had not
                    deſpaired of their country; but were determined to deliver the queen from
                    bondage, to protect the perſon of the prince, to revenge the murder of the king,
                    and to vindicate the nation from the infamy it had hitherto ſuffered through the
                    impunity of the regicides. They therefore commanded in general all the ſubjects
                    of Scotland whatſoever, and the burgeſſes and inhabitants of Edinburgh in
                    particular, to take a part with them, and to join in the advancement of purpoſes
                    ſo beneficial and ſalutary. The day after they had publiſhed this
                    proclamation,</p>
                <p>they iſſued another in terms that were ſtronger and more reſolute. They
                    definitively expreſſed their perſuaſion of Bothwel’s guilt in the rape and
                    ſeduction of the queen, and in his perpetration of the king's murder, in order
                    to accompliſh his marriage. They inculcated it as their firm opinion, that
                    Bothwel was now inſtigated with a deſign to murder the young prince, and that he
                    was collecting troops with this view. Addreſſing themſelves, therefore, to all
                    the ſubjects of the realm, whether they reſided in counties or in boroughs, they
                    invited them to come forward to their ſtandard; and deſired them to remember,
                    that all perſons who ſhould preſume to diſobey them ſhould be treated as enemies
                    and traitors.</p>
                <p>Bothwel, in the mean time, was not inactive; and the proclamations of the queen
                    had brought many of her vaſſals to her aſſiſtance. Four thouſand combatants
                    ranged themſelves on her ſide. This force might augment as ſhe approached to her
                    capital; and Bothwel was impatient to put his fortunes to the iſſue of a battle,
                    he left the ſtrong caſtle of Dunbar, where the nobles were not prepared to
                    aſſail him, and where he might have remained in ſafety till they diſperſed
                    themſelves. For their proclamations were not ſo ſucceſsful as they had expected;
                    their proviſions and ſtores were ſcanty; and the zeal of the common people,
                    unſupported by proſperity, would ſoon have abated. Imprudent precipitation
                    ſerved them in a moſt effectual manner. When the queen had reached Gladſmuir,
                    ſhe ordered a maniſeſto to be read to her army, and to be circulated among her
                    ſubjects. By this paper, ſhe replied to the proclamations of the confederated
                    nobles, and charged them with treachery and rebellion. She treated their reaſons
                    of hoſtility as mere pretences, and as inventions which could not bear to be
                    examined. As to the king’s murder, ſhe proteſted, that ſhe herlelf was fully
                    determined to revenge it, if ſhe could be ſo fortunate as to diſcover its
                    perpetrators. With regard to the bondage from which they were ſo deſirous to
                    relieve her, ſhe obſerved, that it was a falſehood ſo notorious, that the
                    ſimpleſt of her ſubjects could confute it; for her marriage had been celebrated
                    in a public manner, and the nobles could hardly have forgotten that they had
                    ſubſcribed a bond recommending Bothwel to be her huſband. With regard to the
                    induſtrious defamations of this nobleman, it was urged, that he had diſcovered
                    the utmoſt ſolicitude to eſtabliſh his innocence. He had invited a ſcrutiny into
                    his guilt; the juſtice of his country had abſolved him; the three eſtates
                    aſſembled in parliament were ſatisfied with the proceedings of his judges and
                    jury; and he had offered to maintain his quarrel againſt any perſon whatſoever
                    who was equal to him in rank and of an honeſt reputation. The nobles, ſhe ſaid,
                    to give a fair appearance to their treaſon, pretended, that Bothwel had ſchemed
                    the deſtruction of the prince, and that they were in arms to protect him. The
                    prince, however, was actually in their own cuſtody; the me they made of him was
                    that of a ſkreen to their perſidiouſneſs; and the real</p>
                <p>purpoſes with which they were animated, were the overthrow of her greatneſs, the
                    ruin of her poſterity, and the uſurpation of the royal authority. She therefore
                    intreated the aid of her faithful ſubjects; and as the prize of their valorous
                    ſervice, ſhe held out to them the eſtates and poſſeſſions oſ the rebels.<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0069.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0063"/> The
                    aſſociated nobles, pleaſed at the approach of the queen, put themſelves in
                    motion. In the city of Edinburgh they had gathered an addition to their force;
                    and it happened that the Scottiſh officer who commanded the companies, which, in
                    this period, the king of Denmark was permitted to enliſt in Scotland, had been
                    gained to aſſiſt them. He had juſt completed his levies; and he turned them
                    againſt the queen. The nobles, after advancing to Muſſelburgh, refreſhed their
                    troops. Intelligence was brought that the queen was upon her march. The two
                    armies were nearly equal in numbers; but the preference, in point of valour and
                    diſcipline, belonged deciſively to the ſoldiers of the nobles. The queen poſted
                    herſelf on the top of Carberry hill. The lords, taking a circuit to humour the
                    ground, ſeemed to be retreating to Dalkeith; but wheeling about, they approached
                    to give her battle. They were ranged in two diviſions. The one was commanded by
                    the earl of Morton and the lord Hume. The other was directed by the earls of
                    Athol, Marre, and Glencairn, with the lords Lindſay, Ruthven, Sempil, and
                    Sanquhar. Bothwel was the leader of the royal forces; and there ſerved under him
                    the lords Seton, Yeſter, and Borthwick.</p>
                <p>It was not without apprehenſions that Mary ſurveyed the formidable appearance of
                    her enemies. Du Croc, the French ambaſſador, haſtened to interpoſe his good
                    offices, and to attempt an accommodation. He aſſured the nobles of the peaceful
                    inclinations of the queen; and that the generoſity of her nature diſpoſed her
                    not only to forgive their preſent inſurrection, but to forget all their former
                    tranſgreffions. The earl of Morton informed him, that they had not armed
                    themſelves againſt the queen, but againſt the murderer of the late king; and
                    that if ſhe would ſurrender him up to them, or command him to leave her, they
                    would conſent to return to their duty. The earl of Glencairn deſired him to
                    obſerve, that the extremity to which they had proceeded might have inſtructed
                    him that they meant not to aſk pardon for any offences they had committed, but
                    that they were reſolved to take cognizance of injuries which had provoked their
                    diſpleaſure. This aſpiring language confounded Du Croc, who had been accuſtomed
                    to the worſhipful ſubmiſſions that are paid to a deſpot. He conceived that all
                    negociation was fruitleſs, and withdrew from the field in the expectation that
                    the ſword would immediately give its law and determine every difference.</p>
                <p>Mary was full of perturbation and diſtreſs. The ſtate into which ſhe had been
                    brought by Bothwel did not fail to engage her ſerious reflection. It was with
                    infinite regret that ſhe conſidered the conſequences of her ſituation at Dunbar.
                    Nor had his behaviour ſince her marriage contributed to allay her inquietudes.
                    The violence of his paſſions, his ſuſpicions, and his guilt, had induced him to
                    ſurround her with his creatures, and to treat her with inſult and indignity. She
                    had been almoſt conſtantly in tears. His demeanor, which was generally rude and
                    indecent, was often ſavage and brutal. At different times his provocations were
                    ſo inſulting, that ſhe had even attempted to arm her hand againſt her life, and
                    was deſirous to relieve her wretchedneſs by ſpilling her blood. Upon his
                    account, ſhe was now encompaſſed with dangers. Her crown was in hazard. Under
                    unhappy agitations, ſhe rode through the ranks of her army, and found her
                    ſoldiers diſpirited. Whatever reſpect they might entertain for her, they had
                    none for her huſband. His own retainers and dependents only were willing to
                    fight for him. He endeavoured to awaken the royal army to valour, by throwing
                    down the gauntlet of defiance againſt any of his adverſaries who ſhould dare to
                    encounter him. His challenge was inſtantly accepted by Kirkaldy of Grange, and
                    by Murray of Tullibardin. He objected that they were not peers. The lord Lindſay
                    diſcovered the greateſt impatience to engage him, and his offer was admitted;
                    but the queen interpoſing her prerogative, prohibited the combat. All the pride
                    and hopes of Bothwel funk within him. His ſoldiers in ſmall parties were
                    ſecretly abandoning their ſtandards. It was equally perilous to the queen to
                    fight or to fly. The moſt prudent expedient for her was to capitulate. She
                    deſired to confer with Kirkaldy of Grange, who remonſtrated to her againſt the
                    guilt and wickedneſs of Bothwel, and counſelled her to abandon him. She
                    expreſſed her willingneſs to diſmiſs him upon the condition that the lords would
                    acknowledge their allegiance and continue in it. Kirkaldy paſſed to the nobles,
                    and received their authority to aſſure her that they would honour, ſerve, and
                    obey her as their princeſs and ſovereign. He communicated this intelligence to
                    her. She adviſed Bothwel to provide for his ſafety by flight; and Kirkaldy
                    admoniſhed him not to neglect this opportunity of effecting his eſcape.
                    Overwhelmed with ſhame, diſappointment, terror, remorſe, and deſpair, this
                    miſerable victim of ambition and guilt turned his eyes to her for the laſt time.
                    To Kirkaldy of Grange ſhe ſtretched out her hand: he kiſſed it and taking the
                    bridle of her horſe, conducted her towards the nobles. They were approaching her
                    with becoming reverence. She ſaid to them, “I am come, my lords, to expreſs my
                    reſpect, and to conclude our agreement; I am ready to be inſtructed by the
                    wiſdom of your counſels; and I am confident that you will treat me as your
                    ſovereign.” The earl of Morton, in the name of the confederacy, ratified their
                    promiſes, and addreſſed her in theſe words: “Madam, you are here among us in
                    your proper place; and we will pay to you as much honour, ſervice, and
                    obedience, as ever in any former period was offered by the nobility to the
                    princes your predeceſſors.”</p>
                <p>This gleam of ſunſhine was ſoon overcaſt. She remained not many hours in the
                    camp, till the common ſoldiers, inſtigated by her enemies, preſumed to inſult
                    her with the moſt unſeemly reproaches. They exclaimed indignantly againſt her as
                    the murderer of her huſband. They reviled her as a lewd adultereſs in the moſt
                    open manner, and in a language the moſt coarſe and the moſt opprobrious. The
                    nobility forgot their promiſes, and ſeemed to have neither honour nor humanity.
                    She had changed one miſerable ſcene for a diſtreſs that was deeper and more
                    hopeleſs. They ſurrounded her with guards, and conducted her to her capital. She
                    was carried along its ſtreets, and ſhown to her people in captivity and ſadneſs.
                    She cried out to them to commiſerate and protect her. They withheld their pity,
                    and afforded her no protection. Even new inſults were offered to her. The loweſt
                    of the populace, whom the declamations of the clergy had driven into rage and
                    madneſs, vied with the ſoldiery in the li-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0070.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0064"/> ecntious outrage of invective and execration,
                    She beſought Maitland to ſolicit the lords to repreſs the inſupportable atrocity
                    of her treatment. She conjured him to let them know, that ſhe would ſubmit
                    herſelf implicitly to the determination of the parliament. Her intreaties and
                    her ſufferings made no impreſſion upon the nobles. They continued the ſavage
                    cruelty of their demeanour. She implored, as the laſt requeſt ſhe would prefer
                    to them, that they would lead her to her palace. This conſolation, too, was
                    refuſed to her. They wiſhed to accuſtom her ſubjects, to behold her in diſgrace,
                    and to teach them to triumph over her misfortunes. In the moſt mortifying and
                    afflicting hour ſhe had ever experienced, oppreſſed with fatigue, and disfigured
                    with duſt and ſorrow, they ſhut her up in the houſe of the lord provoſt: leaving
                    her to revolve in her anxious and agitated mind the indignities ſhe had already
                    endured, and to ſuffer in anticipation the calamities they might yet inflict
                    upon her.</p>
                <p>The malice of Morton and his adherents was ſtill far from being gratified. In the
                    morning, when the queen looked from the window of the apartment to which ſhe had
                    been confined, ſhe perceived a white banner diſplayed in ſuch a manner as to fix
                    her attention. There was delineated upon it the body of the late king ſtretched
                    at the foot of a tree, and the prince upon his knees before it, with a label
                    from his mouth, containing this prayer, "Judge and revenge my cauſe, O Lord!”
                    This abominable banner revived all the bitterneſs of her afflictions. The
                    curioſity of the people drew them to a ſcene ſo new and ſo affecting. She
                    exclaimed againſt the treachery of her nobles; and ſhe begged the ſpectators to
                    relieve her from their tyranny. The eventful ſtory of the preceding day had
                    thrown her capital into a ferment. The citizens of a better condition crowded to
                    behold the degraded majeſty of their ſovereign. Her ſtate of humiliation, ſo
                    oppoſite to the grandeur from which ſhe had fallen, moved them with compaſſion
                    and ſympathy. They heard her tale, and were filled with indignation. Her
                    lamentations, her diſorder, her beauty, all ſtimulated their ardour for her
                    deliverance. It was announced to the nobles, that the tide of popular favour had
                    turned towards the queen. They haſtened to appear before her, and to aſſure her,
                    with ſmiles and courteſy, that they were immediately to conduct her to her
                    palace, and to reinſtate her in her royalty. Impoſing upon her credulous na</p>
                <p>ture, and that beautiful humanity which characterised her even in the moſt
                    melancholy ſituations of her life, they prevailed with her to inform the people,
                    that ſhe was pacified, and that ſhe wiſhed them to diſperſe themſelves. They
                    ſeparated in obedience to her deſire. The nobles now conveyed her to
                    Holyroodhouſe. But nothing could be farther from their intentions than her
                    re-eſtabliſhment in liberty and grandeur. They held a council, in which they
                    deliberated concerning the manner in which they ought to diſpoſe of her. It was
                    reſolved, that ſhe ſhould be confined during her life in the fortreſs of
                    Lochleven; and they ſubſcribed an order for her commitment.</p>
                <p>A reſolution ſo ſudden, ſo perfidious, and ſo tyrannical, filled Mary with the
                    ιιtmoft aſtoniſhment, and drew from her the moſt bitter complaints and
                    exclamations. Kiiſkaldy of Grange, perceiving with ſurpriſe the lengths to which
                    the nobles had proceeded, felt his honour take the alarm for the part he had
                    acted at their deſire. He expoſtulated with them upon their breach of truſt, and
                    cenſured the extreme rigour of the queen’s treatment. They counſelled him to
                    rely upon the integrity of their motives; ſpoke of her paſſion for Bothwel as
                    moſt vehement, and infilled on the danger of intruding her with power. He was

                    full ſenſe of the hazards and inconveniences of an improper paſſion, and a
                    little time would cure her of it. They affured him, that when it appeared that
                    ſhe deteſted Bothwel, and had utterly abandoned his intereſts, they would think
                    of kindneſs and moderation. But this, they urged, could hardly be expected; for
                    they had recently intercepted a letter from her to this nobleman, in which ſhe
                    expreſſed, in the ſtrongeſt terms, the warmth of her love, and her fixed purpoſe
                    never to forſake him<note anchored="true" n="8" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                            Elizabeth interfered in the affairs of Scotland upon the impriſonment of
                            the queen in the caſtle of Lochleven; a period of time when theſe
                            ſtateſmen were deſirous to throw out every imputation to her prejudice,
                            and when in particular they were abuſing her with vehemence for her

                            her, could not well think of a ſtop of this fort, although her
                            attachment to Bothwel had been as ſtrong as they were pleaſed to
                            pronounce it. For, not to ſpeak of the greatneſs of her diſtreſs, ſhe
                            was guarded by them ſo ſtrictly, as to make it vain for her to pretend
                            to elude their vigilance. In regard, too, to her love of Bothwel, it is
                            not clear that it was ever real. While the king was alive, there are no
                            traces of their improper intercourſe. The affair of Dunbar was a
                            criminal ſeduction. The arts of a profligate man overcame her. There was
                            no ſentiment of love upon either ſide. After her marriage, his rudeneſs
                            extinguiſhed in her altogether any remain of kindneſs and reſpect; and
                            hence the coldneſs with which ſhe parted with him.” <hi rend="italic"

                    with his remonſtrances. The queen, in the mean time, ſent a meſſage to this
                    generous ſoldier, complaining of the cruelty of her nobles, and reminding him
                    that they had violated their engagements. He inſtantly addreſſed an anſwer to

                    The device of a letter from her to Bothwel completed the amazement of the queen.
                    So unprincipled a contempt of every thing that is moſt ſacred, ſo barbarous a
                    perſeverance in perſidiouſneſs and injuſtice, extinguiſhed every ſentiment of
                    hope in her boſom. She conceived that ſhe was doomed to inevitable deſtruction,
                    and ſunk under a pang of unutterable anguiſh.</p>
                <p>The Lords Ruthven and Lindſay arrived in this paroxyſm of her diſtreſs, to inform
                    her, that they were commanded to put in execution the order for her commitment.
                    They charged her women to take from her all her ornaments and her royal attire.
                    A mean dreſs was put upon her; and in this diſguiſe they conveyed her with
                    precipitation to the priſon appointed for her. The Lords Seton, Yeſter, and
                    Borthwick, endeavoured to reſcue her, but failed in the attempt. She was
                    delivered over to William Douglas the governor of the caſtle of Lochleven, who
                    had married the mother of the earl of Murray, and was himſelf nearly related to
                    the earl of Morton. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Mary.</hi></p>
                <p>Upon the ſame day on which the nobles ſubſcribed the order for the impriſonment
                    of the queen, they entered into a bond of concurrence or confederacy. By this
                    deed they bound and cemented themſelves into a body for the ſtrenuous
                    proſecution of their quarrel; and it detailed the purpoſes which they were to
                    forward and purſue. They propoſed to puniſh the murderers of the king, to
                    examine into the queen’s rape, to diſſolve her marriage, to preſerve her from
                    the bondage of Bothwel, to protect the perſon of the prince, and to reſtore
                    juſtice to the realm. The fonction of a moſt ſolemn oath confirmed their
                    reliance upon one another; and in advancing their meaſures, they engaged to
                    expoſe and employ their lives, kindred, and fortunes.</p>
                <p>It is eaſy to ſee, notwithſtanding all the pretended patriotiſm of the rebels,
                    that nothing was farther from their intentions than to proſecute Bothwel and
                    reſtore the queen to her dignity. They had already treated her in the vileſt
                    manner, and allowed Bothwel to eſcape when they might eaſily have apprehended
                    and brought him to any trial they thought proper. To exalt themſelves was their
                    only aim. Eleven days alter the capitulation at Carberry hill, they held a
                    convention, in which they very properly aſſumed the name of <hi rend="italic"
                        >lords oſ the ſecret council,</hi> and iſſued a proclamation for
                    apprehending Bothwel as the murderer of the king; offering a reward of loco
                    crowns to any perſon who ſhould bring him to Edinburgh. A ſearch had been made
                    for the murderers of the king that very night in which the queen was confined in
                    Lochleven caſtle. One Sebaſtian a Frenchman, and captain Blackader, were then
                    apprehended; and ſoon after James Edmondſtone, John Blackader, and Mynart
                    Fraſer, were taken up and impriſoned. The people expected full and ſatisfactory
                    proofs of the guilt of Bothwel, but were diſappointed. The affirmation of the
                    nobles, that they were poſſeſſed of evidence which could condemn him, appeared
                    to be no better than a pretence or artifice. Sebaſtian found means to eſcape;
                    the other perſons were put to the torture, and ſuſtained it without making any
                    confeſſion that the nobles could publiſh. They were condemned, however, and
                    executed, as being concerned in the murder, in their dying moments they
                    proteſted their innocence.</p>
                <p>A ſanguine hope was entertained that captain Blackader would reveal the whole
                    ſecret at the place of execution, and a vaſt multitude of ſpectators were
                    preſent. No information, however, could be derived from what he ſaid with regard
                    to the regicides; but while he ſolemnly proteſted that his life was unjuſtly
                    taken away, he averred it as his belief that the earls of Murray and Morton were
                    the contrivers of the king’s murder.</p>
                <p>The lords of the ſecret council now proceeded to the greateſt enormities. They
                    robbed the palace of Holyroodhouſe of its furniture and decorations; converted
                    the queen’s plate into coin; and poſſeſſed themſelves of her jewels, which were
                    of great value; and while the faction at large committed theſe acts of robbery,
                    the earl of Glencairn with ſolemn hypocriſy demoliſhed the altar in the queen’s
                    chapel, and defaced and deſtroyed all its pictures and ornaments. Theſe
                    exceſſive outrages, however, loſt them the favour of the people, and an
                    aſſociation was formed in favour of the queen. The court of France, as ſoon as
                    the news of Mary’s impriſonment arrived, diſpatched M. de Villeroy to condole
                    with her upon her misfortunes: but the lords of the ſecret council would not
                    admit him to ſee her, upon which he immediately returned to his own country. The
                    earl of Murray, however, was at this time in France; and to the promiſes of this
                    ambitious and treacherous wretch the king truſted, imagining him to be a ſteady
                    friend to the unfortunate queen. Elizabeth alſo pretended friendſhip, and
                    threatened the aſſociated lords; but as they had every reaſon to doubt her
                    ſincerity, they paid no regard to her threats, and even refilled to admit her
                    ambaſſador to Mary’s preſence.</p>
                <p>From all theſe appearances of friendſhip Mary neither did nor could derive any
                    real aſſiſtance. On the 24th of July 1567, the lord Lindſay, whoſe imperious
                    behaviour, fays Dr Stuart, approached to inſanity, was ordered by the lords to
                    wait upon the queen at Lochleven. He carried with him three deeds or
                    inſtruments, and was inſtructed not to be ſparing in rudeneſs and menaces in
                    order to compel her to ſubſcribe them. By the firſt, ſhe was to reſign her crown
                    to her infant-ſon; by the ſecond, ſhe appointed the earl of Murray regent of
                    Scotland; and by the third, ſhe conſtituted a council to direct the prince till
                    this nobleman ſhould arrive in Scotland, or in the event of his death or refuſal
                    of the office. On the part of the queen all reſiſtance was vain. Sir Robert
                    Melvil aſſured her, that her belt friends were of opinion, that what ſhe did by
                    compulſion, and in a priſon, could have no power to bind her; and of this ſhe
                    was alſo aſſured by Throgmorton, the Engliſh ambaſſador, in a letter which Sir
                    Robert Melvil brought in the ſcabbard of his ſword. Mary therefore, forlorn and
                    helpleſs, could not reſiſt the barbarous rudeneſs with which Lindſay preſſed the
                    ſubſcription of the papers, though ſhe would not read them. Five days after, the
                    lords of the ſecret council met at Stirling, for the coronation of the young
                    prince, and conſidered themſelves as repreſenting the three eſtates of the
                    kingdom. A proteſtation was made in the name of the duke of Chatelherault, that
                    this ſolemnity ſhould neither prejudge his rights of ſucceſſion nor thoſe of the
                    other princes of the blood. The young prince being preſented to them, the lords
                    Lindſay and Ruthven appeared, and in the name of the queen renounced in his
                    favour her right and title to the crown, gave up the<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0072.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0066"/> papers ſhe
                    had ſubſcribed; and ſurrendered the ſword, ſceptre, and royal crown. After the
                    papers were read, the earls of Morton, Athol, Glencairn, Marre, and Menteith,
                    with the maſter of Graham, the lord Hume, and Bothwel biſhop of Orkney, received
                    the queen’s reſignation in favour of her ſon in the name of the three eſtates.
                    After this formality, the earl of Morton, bending his body, and laying his hand
                    upon the Scriptures, took the coronation oath for the prince, engaging that he
                    ſhould rule according to the laws, and root out all heretics and enemies to the
                    word of God. Adam Bothwel then anointed the prince king of Scotland; a ceremony
                    with which John Knox was diſpleaſed, as believing it to be of Jewiſh invention.
                    This prelate next delivered to him the ſword and the ſceptre, and finally put
                    the crown upon his head. In the proceſſion to the caſtle from the church, where
                    the inauguration was performed, and where John Knox preached the inauguration
                    ſermon, the earl of Athol carried the crown, Morton the ſceptre, Glencairn the
                    ſword, and the earl of Marre carried the prince in his arms. Theſe ſolemnities
                    received no countenance from Elizabeth; and Throgmorton, by her expreſs command,
                    was not preſent at them.</p>
                <p>Soon after this ceremony, the earl of Murray returned from France; and his
                    preſence gave ſuch a ſtrength and firmneſs to his faction, that very little
                    oppoſition could be given by the partiſans of Mary, who were unſettled and
                    deſponding for want of a leader. A little time after his arrival, this monſtrous
                    hypocrite and traitor waited upon his diſtreſſed and inſulted ſovereign at
                    Lochleven. His deſign was to get her to deſire him to accept of the regency,
                    which he otherwiſe pretended to decline. The queen, unſuſpicious of the deepneſs
                    of his arts, conſcious of the gratitude he owed to her, and truſting to his
                    natural affection, and their tie of a common father, received him with a tender
                    welcome. She was in haſte to pour forth her foul to him; and with tears and
                    lamentations related her condition and her ſufferings. He heard her with
                    attention: and turned occaſionallyhis diſcourſe to the topics which might lead
                    her to open to him her mind without diſguiſe in thoſe ſituations in which he was
                    moſt anxious to obſerve it. His eye and his penetration were fully employed; but
                    her diſtreſs awakened not his tenderneſs. He ſeemed to be in ſuſpenſe; and from
                    the guardedneſs of his converſation ſhe could gather neither hope nor fear. She
                    begged him to be free with her, as he was her only friend. He yielded to her
                    intreaties as if with pain and reluctance; and taking a comprehensive ſurvey of
                    her conduct, deſcribed it with all the ſeverity that could affect her moſt. He
                    could diſcover no apology for her miſ-government and diſorders; and, with a
                    mortifying plainneſs, he preſſed upon her conſcience and her honour. At times
                    ſhe wept bitterly. Some errors ſhe confeſſed; and againſt, calumnies ſhe warmly
                    vindicated herſelf. But all ſhe could urge in her behalf made no impreſſion upon
                    him; and he ſpoke to her of the mercy of God as her chief refuge. She was torn
                    with apprehenſions, and nearly diſtracted with deſpair. He dropped ſome words of
                    conſolation; and after expreſſing an attachment to her intereſts, gave her his
                    promiſe to employ all his conſequence to ſecure her life. As to her liberty, he
                    told her, that to atchieve it was beyond all his efforts; and that it was not
                    good for her</p>
                <p>to deſire it. Starting from her ſeat, ſhe took, him in. her arms, and kiſſing him
                    as her deliverer from the ſcaffold, ſolicited his immediate acceptance of the
                    regency. He declared he had many reaſons to refuſe the regency. She implored and
                    conjured him not to abandon her in the extremity of her wretchedneſs. There was
                    no other method, ſhe ſaid, by which ſhe herſelf could be ſaved, her ſon
                    protected, and her realm rightly governed. He gave way to her anxiety and
                    ſolicitations. She beſought him to make the moſt unbounded uſe of her name and
                    authority, defined him to keep for her the jewels that yet remained with her,
                    and. recommended it to him to get an early poſſeſſion of all the forts of her
                    kingdom. He now took his leave of her, and embracing anew this pious traitor,
                    ſhe ſent her bleſſing with him to the prince her ſon.</p>
                <p>In the mean time the wretched earl of Bothwel was ſtruggling with the greateſt
                    difficulties. Sir William Murray and Kirkaldy of Grange had put to ſea in ſearch
                    of him. He had been obliged to exerciſe piracy in order to ſubſiſt himſelf and
                    his followers. His purſuers came upon him unexpectedly at the Orkney iſlands,
                    and took three of his ſhips; but he himſelf made his eſcape. Soon after, having
                    ſeized a Turkiſh trader on the coaſt of Norway, two ſhips of war belonging to
                    the king of Denmark gave chace to him as a pirate. An engagement enſued, in,
                    which Bothwel was taken. His officers and mariners were hanged in Denmark; but
                    Bothwel himſelf, being known by ſome Scottiſh merchants, had his life ſpared. He
                    was thrown, however, into a dungeon, where he remained ten years; and at laſt
                    died melancholy and diſtracted. The regent ſent commiſſioners to the king of
                    Denmark to demand him as a priſoner; but that prince, conſidemng him as a
                    traitor and uſurper, totally diſregarded his requeſt.</p>
                <p>The dreadful fate of Bothwel did not make any alteration in the ſituation of the
                    queen. Her enemies, bent on calumniating her, produced letters, which they ſaid
                    were written and ſent by her to that licentious nobleman during the life of the
                    king. Theſe letters are now univerſally admitted to have been forged by the
                    rebels themſelves, who practiſed likewiſe upon ſome ſervants of Bothwel to
                    accuſe the queen of the murder of her huſband. The letters for ſome time gained
                    credit; but the conſeſſions of the ſervants were all in her favour. When on the
                    ſcaffold, they addreſſed themſelves to the people; and after having ſolemnly
                    declared the innocence of the queen, they proteſted before God and his angels,
                    that the earl of Bothwel had informed them that the earls of Murray and Morton
                    were the contrivers <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the king’s murder.</p>
                <p>It was impoſſible that ſuch tranſactions as theſe could advance the popularity of
                    the regent. His unbounded ambition and cruelty to his ſovereign began at laſt to
                    open the eyes of the nation; and a party was forming itſelf in favour of the
                    queen. She herſelf had been often meditating her eſcape from her priſon; and ſhe
                    at laſt effected it by means of a young gentleman Georgy Douglas, brother to her
                    keeper, who had fallen in love with her. On the 2d day of May 1568, about ſeven
                    o’clock in the evening, when her keeper was at ſupper with hi <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">s</hi> family, George Douglas, poſſeſſing himſelf of the
                    keys of the caſtle, haſtened to her apartment, and conducted her out of priſon.
                    Having locked the gates<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0073.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0067"/> of the caſtle, they immediately entered a boat
                    which waited for them; and being rowed acroſs the lake, the lord Seton received
                    the queen with a choſen band of horſemen in complete armour. That night he
                    conveyed her to his houſe of Niddrie in Weſt Lothian; where having reſted a few
                    hours, ſhe ſet out for Hamilton.</p>
                <p>The eſcape of the queen threw her enemies into the greateſt conſternation. Many
                    forſook the regent openly; arid ſtill more made their ſubmiſſions privately, or
                    concealed themſelves. He did not, however, deſpond; but reſolved to defend
                    himſelf by force of arms. The queen ſoon found herſelf at the head of 6000 men,
                    and the regent oppoſed her with 4000. Mary, however, did not think it proper to
                    riſk a battle; knowing the capacity of the regent as a general, and that his
                    officers were all men of approved valour and experience. But in this prudent
                    reſolution ſhe was over-ruled by the impetuoſity of her troops. A battle was
                    fought on the 13th of May 1568, at Langſide near Glaſgow in which Mary’s army
                    was defeated, and her laſt hopes blaſted. The unfortunate queen fled towards
                    Kirkcudbright; wſhere finding a place of ſafety, ſhe deliberated on the plan ſhe
                    ſhould afterwards follow. The reſult of her deliberations, as frequently happens
                    in cafes of perplexity, led her to take the worſt ſtep poſſible. Not-
                    withſtanding all the perfidy which ſhe had found in Elizabeth, Mary could not
                    think that ſhe would now refuſe to afford her a refuge in her dominions; and
                    therefore determined to retire into England. To this ſhe had been ſolicited by
                    Elizabeth herſelf during her confinement in Lochleven caſtle; and ſhe now
                    reſolved, in oppoſition to the advice of her moſt faithful counſellors, to make
                    the fatal experiment.</p>
                <p>In obedience to her order, the lord Herries addreſſed a letter to Mr Lauder, the
                    deputy-commander at Carliſle; and after detailing her defeat at Langſide,
                    deſired to know if ſhe might truſt herſelf upon Engliſh ground. This officer
                    wrote inſtantly an anſwer, in which he ſaid, that the lord Scroop the warden of
                    the frontiers being abſent, he could not of his private authority give a formal
                    aſſurance in a matter which concerned the ſtate of a queen: but that he would
                    ſend by poſt to his court to know the pleaſure of his ſovereign; and that if in
                    the mean time any neceſſity ſhould force Mary to Carliſle, he would receive her
                    with joy, and protect her againſt her enemies. Mary, however, before the
                    meſſenger could return, had embarked in a fiſhing boat with ſixteen attendants.
                    In a few hours ſhe landed at Wirkington in Cumberland; and from thence ſhe
                    proceeded to Cockerrnouth, where ſhe continued till Mr Lauder, having aſſembled
                    the gentlemen of the country, conducted her with the greateſt reſpect to the
                    caſtle of Carliſle.</p>
                <p>To Elizabeth ſhe announced her arrival in a diſpatch, which deſcribed her late
                    misfortunes in general and pathetic terms, and in which ſhe expreſſed an earneſt
                    ſolicitude to pay her a viſit at her court, and the deep ſenſe ſhe entertained
                    of her friendſhip and generoſity. The queen of England, by obliging and polite
                    letters, condoled with her upon her ſituation, and gave her aſſurances of all
                    the favour and protection that were due to the juſtice of her cauſe. But as they
                    were not accompanied with an invitation to London, Mary took the alarm. She
                    thought it expedient to inftruct lord</p>
                <p>Fleming to repair to France; and ſhe instructed lord Herries with a moſt preſſing
                    remonſtrance to Elizabeth. Her anxiety for an interview in order to vindicate
                    her conduct, her ability to do ſo in the moſt ſatisſactory manner, and her power
                    to explain the ingratitude, the crimes, and the perfidy of her enemies, were
                    urged to this princeſs. A delay in the ſtate of her affairs was repreſented as
                    nearly equivalent to abſolute deſtruction. An immediate proof was therefore
                    requeſted from Elizabeth of the ſincerity of her profeffions. If ſhe was
                    unwilling to admit into her preſencfe a queen, a relation, and a friend, ſhe was
                    reminded, that as Mary’s entrance into her dominions had been voluntary, her
                    departure ought to be equally free and unreſtrained. She valued the protection
                    of the queen of England above that of every other potentate upon earth; but if
                    it could not be granted, ſhe would ſolicit the amity, and implore the aid, of
                    powers who would commiſerate her afflictions, and be forward to relieve them.
                    Amidſt remonſtrances, however, which were ſo juſt and ſo natural, Mary failed
                    not to give thanks to Elizabeth for the courteſy with which ſhe had hitherto
                    been treated in the caſtle of Carliſle. She took the opportunity alſo to beg of
                    this princeſs to avert the cruelty of the regent from her adherents, and to
                    engage him not to waſte her kingdom with hostility and</p>
                <p>ravages; and ſhe had the prudence to pay her compliments in an affectionate
                    letter to ſecretary Cecil, and to court his kind offices in extricating her from
                    her difficulties and troubles.</p>
                <p>But the queen of England was not to be moved by remonſtrances. The voluntary
                    offer of Mary to plead her cauſe in the preſence of Elizabeth, and to ſatisfy
                    all her ſcruples, was rejected. Her diſaſters were rather a matter of exultation
                    than of pity. The deliberations of the Engliſh queen, and thoſe of her
                    ſtateſmen, were not directed by maxims of equity, of compaſſion, or of
                    generoſity. They conſidered the flight of Mary into England as an incident that
                    was fortunate and favourable to them; and they were ſolicitous to adopt thoſe
                    meaſures which would enable them to draw from it the greateſt profit and
                    advantage. If the queen of Scots were allowed to rcturn to her own dominions, it
                    was probable that ſhe would ſoon be in a condition to deſtroy the earl of Murray
                    and his faction, who were the friends of England. The houſe of Hamilton, who
                    were now zealous in the intereſts of France, would riſe into conſideration änd
                    povver. England would be kept in perpetual turmoils upon the frontiers; Ireland
                    would receive moleſtation from the Scots, and its diſturbances grow important
                    and dangerous. Mary would renew with redoubled ardour her deſigns againſt the
                    Proteſtant religion; and a French army would again be introduced into Scotland.
                    For theſe reaſons, Elizabeth and her miniſters determining not to reſtore the
                    queen of Scots to her throne, conſidered what would be the probable conſequences
                    of permitting her to remain at liberty in England. In this ſituation, ſhe would
                    augment the number of her partizans, ſend to every quarter her emiſſaries, and
                    inculcate her title to the crown. Foreign ambaſſadors would afford her aid, and
                    take a ſhare in her intrigues; and Scotland, where there was ſo high an object
                    to be gained, would enter with cordiality into her views. This plan being alſo
                    hazardous, it was deliberated whether the<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0074.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0068"/> queen of Scots might not be allowed to take a
                    voyage into France. But all the pretenſions which had hitherto threatened the
                    crown of Elizabeth would in this caſe be revived. A ſtrong reſentment to her
                    would even urge Mary and Charles IX. to the boldeſt and moſt deſperate
                    enterpriſes. The party of the queen of Scots in England, ſtrong from motives of
                    religion and affection, and from diſcontents and the love of change, would
                    ſtimulate their anger and ambition. England had now no territories in France. A
                    war with that country and with Scotland would involve the greateſt dangers. Upon
                    revolving theſe meaſures and topics, Elizabeth and her counſellors were induced
                    to conclude, that it was by far the wiſeſt expedient to keep the queen of Scots
                    in confinement, to invent methods to augment her diſtreſs, to give countenance
                    to the regent, and to hold her kingdom in dependence and ſubjection.</p>
                <p>In conſequence of this cruel and unjuſt reſolution, Mary was acquainted, that ſhe
                    could not be admitted into Elizabeth’s preſence till ſhe had clearcd herſelf of
                    the crimes imputed to her; ſhe was warned not to think of introducing French
                    troops into Scotland; and it was hinted, that for the more ſecurity ſhe ought to
                    be removed farther from the frontier. This meſſage at once ſhowed Mary the
                    imprudence of her conduct in truſting herſelf to Elizabeth. But the error could
                    not now be remedied. She was watched to prevent her eſcape, and all her
                    remonſtrances were vain. The earl of Murray had offered to accuſe her; and it
                    was at laſt concluded that Elizabeth could not, conſiſtently with her own honour
                    and the tranquillity of her government, ſuffer the queen of Scots to come into
                    her preſence, to depart out of England, or to be reſtored to her dignity, till
                    her cauſe ſhould be tried, and decided. An order was given to remove her from
                    Carliſle caille to a place of ſtrength at a greater diſtance from the borders,
                    to confine her more cloſely, and to guard againſt all poſſibility of an
                    eſcape.</p>
                <p>In conſequence of theſe extraordinary tranſactions, a trial took place, perhaps
                    the moſt remarkable for its injuſtice and partiality of any recorded in hiſtory.
                    Mary, confined and apprehenſive, ſubmitted to be tried as they thought proper.
                    The regent, who was to be the accuſer, was ſummoned. into England, and
                    commiſſioners were appointed on both ſides. On the 4th of October, the
                    commiſſioners met at York; and four days after, the deputies of the queen of
                    Scots were called to make known their complaints. They related the moſt material
                    circumſtances of the cruel uſage ſhe had received. Their accuſations were an
                    alarming introduction to the buſineſs in which the regent had embarked; and
                    notwithſtanding the encouragement ſhown to him by Elizabeth, he was aſſaulted by
                    apprehenſions. The artifices of Maitland added to his alarms. Inſtead of
                    proceeding inſtantly to defend himſelf, or to accuſe the queen, he fought
                    permiſſion to relate his doubts and ſcruples to the Engliſh commiſſioners. In
                    his own name, and with the concurrence of his aſſociates, he demanded to know
                    whether they had ſufficient authority from Elizabeth to pronounce, in the caſe
                    of the murder, Guilty or not guilty, according to the evidence that ſhould be
                    laid before them; whether they would actually exerciſe this power; whether, in
                    the event of her criminality, their ſovereign ſhould be deli</p>
                <p>vered to him and his friends, or detained in England in ſuch a way as that no
                    danger ſhould enſue from her activity; and whether, upon her conviction, the
                    queen of England would allow his proceedings, and thoſe of his party, to be
                    proper, maintain the government of the young king, and ſupport him in the
                    regency in the terms of the act of parliament which had confirmed him in that
                    office. To theſe requiſitions, it was anſwered, upon the part of the Engliſh
                    deputies, that their commiſſion was ſo ample, that they could enter into and
                    proceed with the controverſy; and that they had liberty to declare, that their
                    ſovereign would not reſtore the queen of Scots to her crown, if ſatisfactory
                    proofs of her crime ſhould be produced; but that they knew not, and were not
                    inſtructed to ſay, in what manner ſhe would finally conduct herſelf as to her
                    perſon and puniſhment. With regard to the ſovereignty of the prince, and the
                    regency of the earl of Murray, they were points, they obſerved, which might be
                    canvaſſed in a futurer period. Theſe replies did not pleaſe the regent and his
                    affociaties; and they requeſted the Engliſh commiſſioners to tranſmit their
                    doubts and ſcruples to be examined and anſwered by Elizabeth.</p>
                <p>But while the regent diſcovered in this manner his apprehenſions, he yet affirmed
                    that he was able to anſwer the charges imputed to him and his faction; and this
                    being in a great meaſure a diſtinct matter from the controverſy of the murder,
                    he was deſired to proceed in it. It was contended, that Bothwel, who had the
                    chief concern in the murder of lord Darnley, poſſeſſed ſuch credit with the
                    queen, that within three months after that horrible event, he ſeized her perſon
                    and led her captive to Dunbar, obtained a divorce from his wife, and married
                    her: that the nobility, being moved with his crimes, did confederate to puniſh
                    him; to relieve her from the tyranny of a man who had raviſhed her, and who
                    could not be her huſband; and to preſerve the life of the prince: that having
                    taken arms for theſe purpoſes, the earl marched againſt them; but that,
                    propoſing to decide the quarrel by ſingle combat, his challenge was accepted:
                    that he declined, notwithſtanding, to enter the lifts, and fled: that, the
                    queen, preferring his impunity to her own. honour, favoured his eſcape by going
                    over to the nobility: that they conducted her to Edinburgh, where they informed
                    her of the motives of their proceedings, requeſted her to take the proper ſteps
                    againſt him and the other regicides, and intreated her to diſſolve her pretended
                    marriage, to take care of her ſon, and to conſult the tranquillity of her realm:
                    that this treatment being offenſive to her, ſhe menaced them with vengeance, and
                    offered to ſurrender her crown if they would permit her to poſſeſs the murderer
                    of her huſband: that her inflexible mind, and the neceſſities of the ſtate,
                    compelled. them to keep her at a diſtance from him, and out of the way of a
                    communication with his adherents: that during her confinement, finding herſelf
                    fatigued with the troubles of royalty, and unfit for them from vexation of
                    ſpirit and the. weakneſs of her body and intellect, ſhe freely and of her, own
                    will reſigned her crown to her ſon, and conſtituted the earl of Murray to the
                    regency; that the king accordingly had been crowned, and Murray admitted to the
                    regency; that the fonction of the three eſtates aſſembled in parliament having

                    ſteady adminiſtration of juſtice had taken place: that certain perſons, however,
                    envious of the public order and peace, had brought her out of priſon, and had

                    faction.</p>
                <p>This apology, ſo imperfect, ſo impudent, and ſo irreconcileable with hiſtory,
                    received a complete confutation from the deputies of the queen of Scots. To take
                    arms againſt her becauſe Bothwel had her favour, was, they ſaid, a lame
                    juſtiſication of the earl of Murray and his friends; ſince it had never been
                    properly manifeſted to her that he was the murderer of her huſband. He had
                    indeed been ſuſpected of this crime; but had been tried by his peers, and
                    acquitted. His acquittal had been ratified in parliament, and had obtained the
                    expreſs approbation of the party who were now ſo loud in accuſing him, and who
                    had conſpired againſt her authority. Theſe rebels had even urged her to
                    accompliſh her marriage with him, had recommended him as the fitteſt perſon to
                    govern the realm, and had ſubſcribed a bond aſſerting his innocence, and binding
                    themſelves to challenge and puniſh all his adverſaries and opponents. They had
                    never, either before or after the marriage, like true ſubjects, advertiſed the
                    queen of his guilt, till, having experience of their ſtrength, they ſecretly
                    took arms, and inveſted her in Borthwick caſtle. The firſt mark of their
                    diſplealure was the ſound of a trumpet in hoſtility, and the diſplay of warlike
                    banners. She made her eſcape to Dunbar; and they returning to Edinburgh, levied
                    troops, iſſued proclamations, took the field againſt her, under the pretence of
                    delivering her from his tyranny, and got poſſeſſion of her perſen. She was
                    willing to prevent the effuſion of blood, and was very far from preferring his
                    impunity to her honour. Kirkaldy of Grange, in obedience to inſtructions from
                    them, deſired her to cauſe him to retire, and invited her to paſs to them under
                    the promiſe of being ſerved and obeyed as their ſovereign. She conſented, and
                    Kirkaldy taking Bothwel by the hand, recommended it to him to depart, and
                    aſſured him that no man would purſue him. It was by their own contrivance that
                    he fled; and it was in their power to have taken him; but they ſhowed not the
                    ſmalleſt deſire to make him their priſoner. He remained, too, for ſome time in
                    the kingdom, and was unmoleſted by them; and it was not till he was upon the
                    ſeas that they affected to go in ſearch of him. When ſhe ſurrendered herſelf in
                    the fight of their army, the earl of Morton ratified the ſtipulations of
                    Kirkaldy, made obeiſance to her, in their names, and promiſed her all the
                    ſervice and honour which had ever been paid to any of her predeceſſors. They
                    were not ſlaves, however, to their engagements. They carried her to Edinburgh,
                    but did not lodge her in her palace. She was committed to the houſe of a
                    burgeſs, and treated with the vileſt indignities. She indeed broke out into
                    menaces, and threatened them; nor was. this a matter either of blame or of
                    wonder. But it was utterly falſe that ſhe had ever made any offer to give away
                    her crown, if ſhe might poſſeſs Bothwel. In the midſt of her ſufferings, ſhe had
                    even required them by ſecretary Maitland to ſpecify their complaints, and
                    beſought them to allow her to appear in parliament, and to join and aſſiſt in
                    ſeeking a remedy to them from the wiſdom of the three eſtates This overture,
                    however, ſo ſalutary and ſubmiſſive, they abſolutely rejected.— They were
                    animated by purpoſes of ambition, and had not in view a relief from grievances.
                    They forced her from her capital in the night, and impriſoned her in Lochleven;
                    and there, they affirm, being exhauſted with the toils of government and the
                    languors of ſickneſs, ſhe, without conſtraint or ſolicitation, reſigned her
                    crown to her ſon, and appointed the earl of Murray to be regent during his
                    minority. This indeed was to aſſume an unlimited power over facts; but the truth
                    could neither be concealed, nor overturned, nor palliated. She was in the vigour
                    of youth, unaſſailed by maladies, and without any infirmity that could induce
                    her to ſurrender the government of her kingdom. Nor was it unknown to them that
                    the earl of Athol and the barons Tullibardin and Lethington, principal men of
                    their council, diſpatched Sir Robert Melvil to her with a ring and preſents,
                    with a recommendation to ſubſcribe whatever papers ſhould be laid before her, as
                    the only means in her power to ſave her life, and with an aſſurance that what
                    ſhe did under captivity could not operate any injury to her. Melvil, too,
                    communicated to her an intimation in writing from Sir Nicholas Throgmorton,
                    which gave her the ſame advice and the ſame aſſurance. To Sir Nicholas
                    Throgmorton ſhe ſent an anſwer, informing him that ſhe would follow his counſel;
                    and enjoining him to declare to his miſtreſs her hapleſs ſtate and that her
                    reſignation of her crown was conſtrained. Nor did this ambaſſador neglect her
                    commiſſion; and it was a popular perſuaſion that Elizabeth would have marched an
                    army to her relief, if ſhe had not been intimidated by the threat of the rebels,
                    that the blood of the queen of Scots would be the wages of her ſoldiers. It was
                    alſo not to be contradicted, that when the lord Lindſay preſented to his
                    ſovereign the inſtruments of reſignation, he menaced her with a cloſer priſon
                    and a ſpeedy death if ſhe ſhould refuſe to ſubſeribe them. It was under an
                    extreme terror, and with many tears, that ſhe put her name to them. She did not
                    conſider them as her deeds; did not read them; and proteſted, that when ſhe was
                    at liberty, ſhe would diſavow ſubſcriptions which had been extorted from her.
                    Even Douglas, the keeper of Lochleven, could not endure to be a witneſs of the
                    violence employed againſt her. He departed out of her preſence, that he might
                    not ſee her ſurrender her rights againſt her will; and he fought and obtained
                    from her a certificate, that he was not acceſſory to this compulſion and
                    outrage. Nor did it conſiſt with the ſlighteſt probability or reaſon, that ſhe
                    would, of her own will and accord, execute a reſignation of her royal eſtate,
                    and retain no proviſion for her future maintenance. Yet by theſe extraordinary
                    deeds, the condition to which ſhe was reduced was moſt miſerable and wretched.
                    For no portion whatever of her revenue was referred to her, and no ſecurity of
                    any kind was granted either for her liberty or her life. As to the coronation of
                    the prince, it could have no validity, as being founded in a pretended and
                    forced reſignation. It was alſo defective in its form; for there were in
                    Scotland more than an hundred earls, biſhops, and lords; and of theſe the whole,
                    or at leaſt the major part, ought<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0076.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0070"/> to concur in matters of importance. Now there
                    did not aſſiſt in it more than four earls, ſix lords, one biſhop, and two or
                    three abbots. Proteſtations, too, were openly made, that nothing tranſacted at
                    that period ſhould be any prejudice to the queen, her eſtate, and the
                    blood-royal of Scotland. Neither could it be rightly conceived, that if the
                    queen had willingly ſurrendered her dignities, ſhe would have named the earl of
                    Murray to the regency in preference to the duke of Chatelherault, who had a
                    natural and proper claim to it, and who had deſerved well of her country by
                    diſcharging that high office during her minority. As to the ratification of the
                    inveſtiture of the young prince, and the regency of the earl of Murray by the
                    eſtates, it was obſervable, that this was done in an illegal parliament. It was
                    an invalid confirmation of deeds which in themſelves had no inherent power or
                    efficacy. The principal nobility, too, objected in this parliament to this
                    ratification. Proteſtations were made before the lords of the articles, as well
                    as before the three eſtates, to interrupt and defeat tranſactions which were in
                    a wild hoſtility to the conſtitution and the laws. Neither was it true that the
                    government of the king and the regent was univerſally obeyed, and adminiſtered
                    with equity and approbation: for a great diviſion of the nobility never
                    acknowledged any authority but that of the queen, and never held any courts but
                    in her name; and it was notorious, that the adminiſtration of the uſurpers had
                    been marked and diſtinguiſhed by enormous cruelties and oppreſſions. Many
                    honourable families and loyal ſubjects had been persecuted to ruin, and
                    plundered of their wealth, to gratify the retainers and ſoldiers who upheld this
                    inſolent domination; and murder and bloodſhed, theft and rapine, were prevalent
                    to a degree unheard of for many ages. Upon all theſe accounts, it was inferred,
                    that Elizabeth ought to ſupport the queen of Scots, to reſtore her to her crown,
                    and to overthrow the power of a moſt unnatural and rebellious faction.</p>
                <p>To theſe facts the regent did not pretend to make any objection; and though
                    required by the Engliſh commiſſioners to produce founder and better reaſons for
                    his treatment of the queen, he did not advance any thing in his own behalf. He
                    even allowed the charges of treaſon and uſurpation to be preſſed againſt him,
                    without preſuining to anſwer. This ſurpriſing behaviour, which might readily
                    have been conſtrued into an acknowledgment of his guilt, it ſeems, proceeded
                    from ſome conferences which he had with the duke of Norfolk. This nobleman was a
                    zealous partizan for the ſucceſſion of Mary to the Engliſh crown. He was
                    ſtrongly poſſeſſed with the opinion, that his miſtreſs, while ſhe was diſpoſed
                    to gratify her animoſity and jealouſies againſt the queen of Scots, was ſecretly
                    reſolved, by fixing a ſtain upon her, to exclude her altogether from the
                    ſucceſſion, and to involve her ſon in her diſgrace. He was eager to defeat a
                    purpoſe, which he conceived to be not only unjuſt in itſelf, but highly
                    detrimental to his country. It was in his power to act with this view; and he
                    obſerved with pleaſure, that Maitland of Lethington was favourable to Mary. To
                    this ſtateſman, accordingly, he ventured to expreſs his ſurpriſe, that the
                    regent could be allured to think of an attempt ſo blameable as that of
                    criminating his ſovereign. If Mary had really given offence by miſcarriage and
                    miſtakes, it yet was not the buſineſs of a good ſubject induſtriouſly to hold
                    her out to ſcorn. Anxious and repeated conferences were held by them; and at
                    length it was formally agreed, that the regent ſhould not accuſe the queen of
                    Scots; and that the duke in return ſhould protect him in the favour of
                    Elizabeth, and ſecure him in the poſſeſſion of his regency.</p>
                <p>But while the regent engaged himſelf in this intrigue with the duke of Norfolk,
                    he was deſirous not- withſtanding of gratifying the reſentments of Elizabeth,
                    and of advancing his own intereſts by undermining ſecretly the fame and
                    reputation of his ſovereign. He inſtructed Maitland, George Buchanan, James
                    Macgill, and John Wood, to go to the duke of Norfolk, the earl of Suſſex, and
                    Sir Ralph Sadler, and to communicate to them as private perſons, and not in
                    their character of commiſſioners, the letters to Bothwel, and the other proofs
                    upon which he affirmed the guilt of the queen of Scots. It was his deſire that
                    they would examine theſe papers, give their opinion of them to Elizabeth, and
                    inform him whether ſhe judged them ſufficient evidences of Mary’s concern in the
                    murder of her huſband. It this ſhould be her opinion, he teſtiſied his own
                    readineſs, and that of his aſſociates, to ſwear that the papers were genuine,
                    and of the hand-writing of the queen. By this operation, he was ſolicitous to
                    eſtabliſh his vouchers as inconteſtable, and as teſtimonies oſ record. The
                    commiſſioners examined his papers, and heard the comments of Buchanan and his
                    other aſſiſtants; but they do not ſeem to have bellowed the fulleſt credit upon
                    them. They deſcribed them, however, to Elizabeth; pointed out the places of them
                    which were ſtrongeſt againſt Mary; and allowed that their force and meaning were
                    very great, if their genuineneſs could be demonſtrated. But of their genuineneſs
                    they acknowledged that they had no other evidence than ſtout aſſertions, and the
                    offer of oaths. The earl of Suſſex, in a private diſpatch to ſecretary Cecil,
                    does more than inſinuate<note anchored="true" n="9" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* <hi rend="italic">Robertson of Dalmeny's
                                History</hi>, amp;c. book 4.</p></note> *, that he thought Mary
                    would be able to prove the letters palpable forgeries; and with reſpect to the
                    murder of the king, he declares in plain terms, that from all he could learn,
                    Murray and his faction would, upon a judicial trial, be found by “proofs hardly
                    to be denied,” more criminal in that charge than the queen herſelf. Elizabeth
                    and her miniſters, upon the receipt of ſuch diſpatches, did not think it
                    expedient to empower them to adopt a method of proof ſo palpably ſuſpicious, and
                    in which ſhe could not openly concur, without groſsly violating even the
                    appearance of probity. The regent had before attempted to engage her in a direct
                    aſſurance of the validity of his papers, when he ſubmitted copies of them to her
                    infpection by his ſecretary Mr Wood. His attempt at this juncture was of a
                    ſimilar kind; and it could not recommend him to the Engliſh commiſſioners.</p>
                <p>Nor were theſe the only tranſactions which took place during the continuance of
                    the commiſſioners at York. The inventive and refining genius of Lethington had
                    ſuggeſted to him a project, which he communicated in confidence to the biſhop of
                    Roſs. It received the warm approbation of this eccleliaſtic; and they determined
                    to put it to a trial. While they attended the duke of Norfolk to the diverſion
                    of hawking, they inlinuated into him the notion of his allying himſelf with the
                    queen of Scots. Her beauty, her accompliſh-<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0077.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0071"/> merits, and
                    her kingdom, were high allurements to this nobleman; and as he was the greateſt
                    ſubject of England, and perhaps of Europe, he ſeemed not to be unworthy of them.
                    The propoſal was very flattering to the admiration he entertained of Mary, to
                    his ambition, and to his patriotiſm. The more he thought of it, he was the more
                    convinced of its propriety. His acceſs to be informed of the practices of the
                    regent, deſtroyed in him the operation of theſe ſlanders by which her enemies
                    were ſo active to traduce her. In this ſtate of his mind, the lady Scroop, his
                    ſiſter, who reſided at Bolton Caſtle with Mary, completely confirmed his
                    resolution. For from her he learned the orderly carriage and the amiable
                    diſpoſitions of the queen of Scots. He was now impatient to have a fit ſeaſon to
                    make her formally the offer of his hand.</p>
                <p>Elizabeth in the mean time was thrown into confuſion by the refuſal of the regent
                    to accuſe the queen of Scots. To give a poſitive anſwer to his doubts and
                    ſcruples was not confident with her honour; and yet, without this condeſcenſion,
                    ſhe was aſſured that the Scottiſh deputies would not exhibit their charge or
                    crimination. Having deceived Mary therefore with fair promiſes, ſhe was active
                    in gaining over the regent to her views; which having done, he conſented at laſt
                    to prefer his accuſation againſt Mary before the commiſſioners, who now met at
                    Weſtminſter by the command of Elizabeth. The charge was expreſſed in general and
                    presumptive terms. It affirmed, that as James earl of Bothwel was the chief
                    executor of the murder of king Henry, ſo the queen was his perſuader and counſel
                    in the device; that ſhe was a maintainer and fortifier of this unnatural deed,
                    by ſtopping the inquiſition into it and its puniſhment, and by taking in
                    marriage the principal regicide; that they had begun to exerciſe a cruel tyranny
                    in the commonwealth, and had formed a reſolution of deſtroying the innocent
                    prince, and of tranſferring the crown from the true line of its kings to a
                    bloody murderer and a godleſs tyrant; and that the eſtates of the realm, finding
                    her unworthy to reign, had ordered her to reſign the crown, her ſon to be
                    crowned, and the earl of Murray to be eſtabliſhed in the regency. Before this
                    accuſation was preferred, the earl of Lenox preſented himſelf before the Engliſh
                    commiſſioners; made a lamentable declaration of his griefs, and produced to them
                    the letters which had paſſed between him and Mary concerning the murder, with a
                    writing which contained a direct affirmation of her guilt.</p>
                <p>The deputies of Mary were aftoniſlied at this accuſation, being a violent
                    infringement of a proteſtation which they had formerly given in, and which had
                    been accepted, namely, that the crown, eſtate, perſon, and honour of the queen
                    of Scots, ſhould be guarded againſt every aſſault and injury; yet in all theſe
                    particulars ſhe was touched and affected. It was underſtood that no judicial
                    proceedings ſhould take place againſt her; yet ſhe was actually arraigned as a
                    criminal, and her deputies were called upon to defend her. They diſcovered not,
                    however, any apprehenſion of the validity of the charge; and while they fully
                    explained the motives which actuated the earl of Murray and his faction in their
                    proceedings, they imputed to perſons among themſelves the guilt of the king’s
                    murder. They affirmed, that the queen’s adverſanes were the accomplices of
                    Bothwel; that they had ſubſcribed a bond conſpiring the death of the king; and
                    that their guilt had been atteſted in the fight of 10,000 ſpectators by thoſe of
                    their confederates who had already been executed. They exclaimed againſt the
                    enormous ingratitude, and the unparalleled audacity of men, who could forget ſo
                    completely all the obligations which they owed to their ſovereign; and who, not
                    ſatisfied with uſurping her power, could even charge her with a murder which
                    they themſelves had committed. They repreſented the ſtrong neceſſity which had
                    ariſen for the fulleſt vindication of their miſtreſs; and they ſaid, that in ſo
                    weighty an extremity, they could not poſſibly ſuppoſe that ſhe would be
                    reſtrained from appearing in her own defence. They had her inſtructions, if her
                    honour was touched, to make this requiſition; and till it was granted, they
                    inſiſted, that all proceedings in the conference ſhould be at am end. A refuſal
                    of this liberty, in the ſituation to which; ſhe was driven, would be an
                    infallible proof that no good was intended to her. It was their wiſh to deal
                    with ſincerity and uprightneſs; and they were perſuaded, that without a proper
                    freedom of defence, their queen would neceſſarily fall a victim to partiality
                    and injuſtice. They therefore earneſtly preſſed the Engliſh commiſſioners, that
                    ſhe might be permitted to preſent herſelf before Elizabeth, the nobles of
                    England, and the ambaſſadors of foreign nations, in order to manifeſt to the
                    world the injuries ſhe had ſuffered, and her innocence.</p>
                <p>After having made theſe ſpirited repreſentations to the Engliſh commiſſioners,
                    the deputies of Mary deſired to have acceſs to the queen of England. They were
                    admitted accordingly to an audience; and in a formal addreſs or petition they
                    detailed what had happened, inſiſted that the liberty of perſonal defence ſhould
                    be allowed to their miſtreſs, and demanded that the earl of Murray and his
                    aſſociates ſhould be taken into cuſtody, till they ſhould anſwer to ſuch charges
                    as ſhould be preferred againſt them. She deſired to have ſome time to turn her
                    thoughts to matters of ſuch high importance; and told them, that they might ſoon
                    expect to hear from her.</p>
                <p>The biſhop of Rofs, and the other deputies of Mary, in the mean time, ſtruck with
                    the perfidious management of the Conference, convinced of the jealouſies and
                    paſſions of Elizabeth, ſenſible that her power over her commiſſioners was
                    unlimited, and anxious for the deliverance of their miſtreſs, made an overture
                    for an accommodation to the earl of Leiceſter and Sir William- Cecil. They
                    propoſed, that the original meaning of the conference ſhould ſtill be adhered
                    to, notwithſtanding the accuſation which had been preſented by the earl of
                    Murray; and that Elizabeth, diſregarding it as an effort of faction, ſhould
                    proceed to a good agreement between Mary and her ſubjects. For this ſcheme,
                    which is ſo expreſſive of their ſuſpicions of Elizabeth and of her
                    commiſſioners, they had no authority from their miſtreſs. They acknowledged-
                    accordingly, that it was made without her inſtructions; and intimated that they
                    were moved to it by their anxiety for peace and the re-eſtabliſhment of the
                    affairs of the Scottiſh nation. They were introduced at Hampton-court to
                    Elizabeth; who liſtened to their motion, and was averſe front it. They then
                    repeated the deſires of the petition they had preſented to her; but ſhe did
                        not<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0078.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0072"/> think
                    it right that the queen of Scots ſhould yet have the liberty to defend herſelf
                    in perſon. She confeſſed, indeed, that it was reaſonable that Mary ſhould be
                    heard in her own cauſe; but ſhe affirmed, that ſhe was at a loſs at what time
                    ſhe ſhould appear, in what place, and to whom ſhe ſhould addreſs herſelf. While
                    ſhe let fall, however, the hope that Mary might obtain the permiſſion ſo
                    repeatedly and ſo earneſtly requeſted, ſhe expreſſed her reſolution that the
                    earl of Murray ſhould firſt be heard in ſupport of his charge, and that ſhe
                    ſhould attend to the proofs which he affirmed himſelf in readineſs to produce.
                    After this buſineſs ſhould be tranſacted, ſhe told the deputies of Mary that ſhe
                    would again confer with them. It was to no purpoſe that they objected to a
                    procedure ſo ſtrange and ſo improper. An accuſation, ſaid they, is given; the
                    perſon accuſed is anxious to defend herſelf; this privilege is denied to her;
                    and yet a demand is to be made for the vouchers of her guilt. What is this but
                    an open violation of juſtice? It did not become them to diſpute her pleaſure in
                    her own dominions: but they would not, they informed her, conſent to a meaſure
                    which was ſo alarming to the intereſts of their queen; and if it was adopted,
                    ſhe might expect that a proteſt againſt its validity would be lodged with her
                    commiſſioners.</p>
                <p>The Engliſh commiſſioners reſumed the conference, and were about to demand from
                    the earl of Murray the proofs with which he could ſupport his accuſation. The
                    biſhop of Roſs and his aſſociates being admitted to them, expreſſed themſelves
                    in conformity to the converſation they had held with Elizabeth. They declared,
                    that it was unnatural and prepoſterous in their ſovereign to think of receiving
                    proofs of the guilt of the queen of Scots before ſhe was heard in her own
                    defence; and they proteſted, that in the event of this proceeding, the
                    negociation ſhould be diſſolved, and Elizabeth be diſarmed of all power to do
                    any prejudice to her honour, perſon, crown, and eſtate. The commiſſioners of the
                    Engliſh queen were affected with this proteſtation, and felt more for the honour
                    of their miſtreſs than for their own. They rcfuſed to receive it, becauſe there
                    were engroſſed in it the words of the refuſal which Elizabeth had given to the
                    petition for Mary. They did not chooſe to authenticate the terms of this refuſal
                    by their ſubſcriptions; and were ſolicitous to ſuppreſs ſo palpable a memorial
                    of her iniquity. They alleged, that the language of her refuſal had not been
                    taken down with accuracy; and they preſſed Mary’s deputies to preſent a ſimpler
                    form of proteſtation. The biſhop of Roſs and his colleagues yielded not,
                    however, immediately to their inſidious importunity; but, repeating anew their
                    proteſtation as they had at firſt planned it, included the expreſs words of
                    Elizabeth; and, when compelled by the power of the commiſſioners to expunge the
                    language of the Engliſh queen, they ſtill infilled upon their proteſtation. An
                    interruption was thus given to the validity of any future proceedings which
                    might affect the reputation of the queen of Scots. The earls of Murray and
                    Morton, with their friends, were very much diſapointed. For they had ſolaced
                    themſelves with the hope of a triumph before there was a victory; and thought of
                    obtaining a decree from Elizabeth, which, while it ſhould pronounce the queen of
                    Scots to be an adultereſs and a murderer, would exalt them into the ſtation and
                    character of virtuous men and honourable ſubjects.</p>
                <p>Though the conference ought naturally to have terminated upon this proteſtation
                    of the deputies pf Mary againſt the injuſtice of Elizabeth, yet it did not
                    ſatisfy the latter princeſs that the accuſation only had been delivered to her
                    commiſſioners: ſhe was ſeriouſly diſpoſed to operate a judicial production of
                    its vouchers. The charge would thus have a more regular aſpect, and be a ſounder
                    foundation upon which to build, not only the infamy of the Scottiſh queen, but
                    her own juſtiſication for the part ſhe had acted. Her commiſſioners accordingly,
                    after the biſhop of Roſs and his colleagues had retired, diſregarding their
                    proteſtation, called upon the earl of Murray and his aſſociates to make their
                    appearance. The pretence, however, employed for drawing from him his papers was
                    ſufficiently artful, and bears the marks of that ſyſtematic duplicity which ſo
                    ſhamefully characterizes all the tranſactions of Elizabeth at this period. Sir
                    Nicholas Bacon the lord keeper addreſſed himſelf to the earl of Murray. He ſaid,
                    that, in the opinion of the queen of England, it was a matter ſurpriſing and
                    ſtrange, that he ſhould accuſe his ſovereign of a crime moſt horrible, odious to
                    God and man, againſt law and nature; and which, if proved to be true, would
                    render her infamous in all the kingdoms of the world. But though he had ſo
                    widely forgot his duty, yet had not Elizabeth renounced her love of a good
                    ſiſter, a good neighbour, and a good friend; and it was her will, that he and
                    his company ſhould produce the papers by which they imagined they were able to
                    maintain their accuſation. The earl of Murray, in his turn, was not wanting in
                    diſſimulation. He expreſſed himſelf to be very ſorry for the high diſpleaſure he
                    had given to Elizabeth by his charge againſt Mary, and for the obſtinacy of the
                    Scottiſh queen and her deputies, which made it neceſſary for him to vindicate
                    himſelf by diſcovering her diſhonour. Under the load of this double and affected
                    ſorrow, he made an actual and formal exhibition of the vouchers by which he
                    pretended to fix and eſtabliſh her criminality. A particular account and
                    examination of theſe vouchers, the reader will find in our life of <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">MAry,</hi> and in the works to which we have there
                    referred.</p>
                <p>To enumerate all the ſhifts to which Elizabeth and the adverlaries of Mary were
                    put, in order to make the ſtrange evidence that was produced wear ſome degree of
                    plauſibility, would far exceed our bounds. It is ſufficient to fay, that after
                    having weaned themſelves with prevarication and falſehood; after having preſſed
                    Mary to abdicate her crown, a requiſition with which ſhe never would comply; and
                    after having finally refuſed to hear her in her own defence; Elizabeth, on the
                    10th of January 1569, gave leave to the earl of Murray and his accomplices to
                    depart her dominions telling them, that ſince they came into England, nothing
                    had been objected to them which could hurt their honour as men, or affect their
                    allegiance as ſubjects. At the ſame time ſhe told them, that they had produced
                    no information or evidence by which ſhe was entitled to conceive any bad opinion
                    of the queen of Scots. It was therefore her pleaſure to allow the affairs of
                    Scotland to continue preciſely in the condition in which they were ſituated at
                    the beginning of the conference. Three<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0079.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0073"/> days after this, they formally took their leave
                    of the queen of England. The deputies of Mary remonſtrated, proteſted, and
                    argued, to no purpoſe; the Engliſh privy-council, with the moſt provoking
                    indifference, told them, that “the earl of Murray had promiſed to their
                    ſovereign, for himſelf and his company, to return to England at any time ſhe
                    ſhould call upon him. But, in the mean time, the queen of Scots could not, for
                    many ſtrong reaſons, be ſuffered to take her departure out of England. As to her
                    deputies, they would move Elizabeth to allow them to return to Scotland; and
                    they believed that ſhe would not detain them.”</p>
                <p>Mary was exceedingly diſappointed and chagrined by this ſingular iſſue of her
                    cauſe. Her friends during this period had increaſed, and the cruel and injurious
                    treatment ſhe had met with was ſo flagrant, that the earl of Murray and his
                    faction were apprehenſive of a ſudden reverſe of fortune. The earls of Argyle
                    and Huntley proteſted againſt the injuſtice of their proceedings, at the ſame
                    time that they openly accuſed the earl of Murray and Maitland of Lethington as
                    the aſſociates of Bothwel in the murder of the king. This charge, according to
                    the cuſtom of the times, they offered to prove as true and certain by the law of
                    arms; and they proteſted, that if their adverſaries ſhould delay to anſwer their
                    challenge, they ſhould be held as confeſſing themſelves guilty of the murder.
                    Elizabeth, however, foreſeeing ſomething of this kind, had diſmiſſed Murray and
                    his adherents with precipitation, ſo that there could now be no formal
                    production of it before the Engliſh commiſſioners. However, it was known and
                    publiſhed in the court of Elizabeth. Murray made an evaſive reply, and
                    Lethington made none at all.</p>
                <p>This, however, afforded no relief to the unhappy queen of Scotland. Her
                    inveterate and treacherous enemy held her faſt, and endeavoured by every method
                    in her power to render her life miſerable. Mary, on thc other hand, never loſt
                    either her ſpirit or her dignity. She attempted to rouſe in the minds of her
                    nobles that paſſion for liberty which had once ſo much diſtinguiſhed the
                    Scottiſh nation, but which now ſeemed to be exchanged for a ſervile ſubjection
                    to the queen of England. But ſome diſpatches which preſſed theſe topics being
                    intercepted, Mary was removed from Bolton to Tutbury caſtle, where ſhe was
                    intruded to the earl of Shrewſbury, and committed to cloſer confinement than ſhe
                    had yet experienced; while Elizabeth diſperſed manifeſtoes all over the northern
                    counties of England, complaining of reports injurious to her honour, and
                    diſclaiming all hoſtile intentions towards the liberties of Scotland.</p>
                <p>In the mean time Murray returned to Scotland, where he took every method to
                    eſtabliſh himſelf in his ill-acquired power. Mary had commanded the duke of
                    Chatelherault to return to Scotland, in order to raiſe forces for her behoof;
                    but this nobleman had been long detained in England by the artifices of
                    Elizabeth, ſo that Murray had arrived there before him. The duke, however, began
                    to raiſe forces, and might have proved a troubleſome antagoniſt, had not Murray
                    deceived him by a pretended negociation, and got him into his power; immediately
                    after which he impriſoned him, and forced moſt of the other lords who were on
                    that ſide to ſubmit.</p>
                <p>When the news of this important event reached the queen of Scots, ſhe inſtructed
                    the biſhop of Roſs to repair to Elizabeth, and to make remonſtrances in their
                    behalf. By the agency of this eccleſiaſtic, whom ſhe had conſtſtuted her
                    ambaſſador, ſhe meant to conduct her tranſactions with the queen of England; and
                    from the concluſion of the conferences, ſhe had been meditating a proper plan
                    upon which to accompliſh her liberty and reſtoration. The biſhop of Roſs, after
                    complaining loudly of the rigorous proceedings of the regent, and intimating the
                    general belief which prevailed that he was ſupported by the Engliſh court,
                    preſſed the propriety of a final ſettlement of the affairs of his miſtreſs. With
                    this view, he was admitted by Elizabeth and her privy-counſellors to frequent
                    conferences; and they even deſired him to preſent to them in writing the
                    articles which he was commanded to propoſe as the foundation of a treaty. He
                    failed not to comply with this injunction; and it was the import of his ſchedule
                    of agreement, that Mary ſhould engage never to moleſt Elizabeth, and the lawful
                    heirs of her body, reflecting the ſucceſſion to the crown of England and
                    Ireland, if ſhe could obtain ſufficient ſecurity that upon their demiſe her
                    rights would be reſpected; that a new treaty of alliance and friendſhip ſhould
                    be concluded between the two queens, by the advice of the eſtates of both
                    kingdoms; that this league ſhould be ratified by their oaths and ſeals, and
                    confirmed by parliamentary acts; and, if any farther aſſurance ſhould be deemed
                    neceſſary on the part of Mary, that ſhe would procure the kings of France and
                    Spain to be the guarantees of her punctuality and concord; that in compliance
                    with the pleaſure of Elizabeth, ſhe would extend her clemency to all her
                    ſubjects who had offended her, under the proviſion that they would ſubmit to her
                    ſovereignty, deliver up the prince her ſon, reſtore her caſtles, give back her
                    jewels, and ſurrender to her friends and ſervants the eſtates and poſſeſſions of
                    which they had been deprived; that the murder of the king ſhould be puniſhed
                    againſt all the actors in it without delay, and according to the laws; that, to
                    prevent Bothwel from returning to Scotland, and to pleaſe thoſe who imagined
                    that it was in his power to excite ferments and trouble, ſhe would be bound to
                    inſtitute a proceſs of divorce againſt him; and that theſe articles being
                    adjuſted, the queen of England ſhould allow her to proceed to Scotland, under a
                    ſafe and honourable convoy, to be re-eſtabliſhed by the three eſtates in her
                    realm and government, and to be gratified with the diſſolution of all the acts
                    and ſtatutes which had been paſſed to her prejudice.</p>
                <p>Theſe heads of alliance were received with a reſpect and cordiality which were
                    not uſually paid to the transactions of Mary in the court of Elizabeth; and the
                    biſhop of Roſs was elated with expectation. Their juſtice, however, was not the
                    ſole, or even the chief, cauſe of this attention and complaiſance. A combination
                    of the Engliſh nobles had taken place againſt Cecil, whoſe power and credit were
                    objects of indignation and jealouſy; and the duke of Norfolk had been active and
                    ſucceſsful in promoting the ſcheme of his marriage with the queen of Scots.
                    Taking advantage of the condition of parties, he had practiſed with the
                    principal nobility to encourage his pretenſions to Mary; and he ſecretly
                    communicated to them the promiſes of<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0080.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0074"/> ſupport he had received from the earl of Murray.
                    By the advice and influence of Sir Nicholas Throgmorton, he engaged in his
                    behalf the earl of Leiceſter; and this nobleman imparted the matter to the earls
                    of Pembroke and Arundel. The duke himſelf was able to conciliate the favour of
                    the earls of Derby, Bedford, Shrewſhury, Southampton, Northampton,
                    Northumberland, Weſtmoreland, and Suſſex. In the mean time, he was eagerly
                    preſſing Mary herſelf with his ſuit and importunities; and had mutually
                    exchanged the tokens of a conſtant and ſincere love. It was in this forward
                    ſtate of the match, that the biſhop of Roſs drew up the ſchedule of articles for
                    the accommodation of the rival queens.</p>
                <p>At the deſire of Elizabeth, her privy-council conferred with the biſhop upon
                    theſe articles at different times; and they expreſſed themſelves to be highly
                    pleaſed with their general import and meaning. Little doubt was entertained of
                    their ſucceſs; and the earl of Leiceſter, in order to complete the bufineſs, and
                    to ſerve the duke of Norfolk, undertook to give them a more ſpecial force, and
                    to improve them by the introduction of a ſtipulation about the marriage of the
                    queen of Scots. According to his ſcheme of agreement, it was required of Mary,
                    that ſhe ſhould be a party to no attempt againſt the rights and titles of the
                    queen of England, or her heirs; that ſhe ſhould conſent to a perpetual league,
                    offenſive and defenſive, between the two kingdoms; that ſhe ſhould finally
                    eſtabliſh the Proteſtant religion in Scotland; that ſhe ſhould admit to her
                    favour thoſe of her ſubjects who had appeared againſt her; that if ſhe had made
                    any aſſignment of her kingdom to the duke of Anjou, in the expectation of a
                    marriage to be contracted between, them, it ſhould be diſſolved; and that
                    inſtead of looking to a foreign prince, whoſe alliance would be dangerous, not
                    only to the religion but to the liberty of the two realms, ſhe would agree to
                    marry the duke of Norfolk, the firſt peer of England. Theſe articles being
                    communicated to the biſhop of Roſs, he was deſired to tranſmit them to Mary;
                    but, as they touched upon ſome points concerning which he had no inſtructions,
                    he declined this office, and recommended the propriety of their employing a
                    ſpecial meſſenger of their own in a commiſſion of ſuch high importance. They
                    accordingly appointed Mr Candiſh to go with them to the queen of Scots, and, in
                    a formal diſpatch, they extolled the merits of the duke of Norfolk; aſſured her
                    of the general favour and ſupport of the Engliſh nobility, if ſhe ſhould approve
                    of his love: and intimated their belief that Elizabeth would not be averſe from
                    a marriage which gave the certain promiſe of tranquillity and happineſs to the
                    two kingdoms. This diſpatch was in the handwriting of Leiceſter; and it was
                    ſubſcribed by this nobleman, and the earls of Arundel and Pembroke, and the lord
                    Lumley.</p>
                <p>Mary, in the ſolitude of her priſon, received this application with pleaſure. By
                    the lord Boyd ſhe returned a very favourable anſwer to it; but took the liberty
                    to admoniſh them of the neceſſity of their ſecuring the good-will of Elizabeth,
                    left her diſlike of the treaty of the marriage ſhould excite new diſaſters and
                    misfortunes, and involve the duke of Norfolk in inconveniency and danger. This
                    advice, the ſuggeſtion of her delicacy and, prudence, did not draw
                    ſufficiently</p>
                <p>their attention. The duke of Norfolk was now impatient to conclude this great
                    tranſaction, in which he had engaged himſelf; and admitted into his councils
                    many nobles whom he had hitherto neglected to court, and many gentlemen who were
                    conſiderabk from their diſtinction and fortunes. The countenance and conſent of
                    the kings of France and Spain were thought neceſſary to the meaſures in
                    agitation, and were ſolicited and obtained. In the univerſality of the applauſe
                    with which they were honoured, it was ſuppoſed that Elizabeth would be allured
                    into a cordial acknowledgment of their propriety, or be compelled to afford them
                    a reluctant approbation; and ſo ardent a belief prevailed of their fortunate
                    termination, that the marriage-contract was actually intruſted to the keeping of
                    M. Fenelon the French ambaſſador.</p>
                <p>The activity of the duke of Norfolk with the Engliſh nobles did not ſo much
                    engroſs his attention as to make him forget the regent. He kept up with him a
                    cloſe correſpondence in conſequence of the concert into which they had entered,
                    and received the moſt ample aſſurances of his fidelity and ſervice. The moſt
                    ſanguine and ſeducing hopes elated him. The regent, while he ſtipulated for
                    terms of favour and ſecurity to himſelf and his faction, appeared to be full of
                    the marriage, as a meaſure from which the greateſt advantages would ariſe to the
                    two kingdoms, to the two queens, and to the true religion. The match, in the
                    meanwhile, was anxiouſly concealed from Elizabeth; but ſhe was zealouſly preſſed
                    to conclude an accommodation with Mary, on the foundation of the ſchedule of
                    agreement preſented by the biſhop of Roſs. After having had many conferences
                    with her privy-council, ſhe ſeemed inclined to treat definitively for the
                    reſtoration of the queen of Scots, and actually agreed to open the tranſaction
                    to the regent. The lord Boyd was ſent into Scotland upon this bufineſs; and
                    while he carried her letters, he was intruſted with diſpatches from Mary, the
                    duke of Norfolk, and Sir Nicholas Throgmorton.</p>
                <p>As the regent was returning from his northern expedition, he was ſaluted at Elgin
                    by the lord Boyd, who immediately laid before him the diſpatches and
                    inſtructions with which he had been charged. The queen of England, in her
                    letters, made three propoſitions in behalf of Mary, and intimated a deſire that
                    one of them ſhould be accepted. The queen of Scots, ſhe ſaid, might be reſtored
                    fully and abſolutely to her royal eſtate: ſhe might be aſſociated in the
                    government with her ſon, have the title of <hi rend="italic">queen,</hi> and,
                    till the prince ſhould attain the age of 17 years, the adminiſtration might
                    continue in the regent; or ſhe might be permitted to return to Scotland in a.
                    private ſtation, and have an honourable appointment to maintain her in a ſafe
                    and happy obſcurity. The diſpatches from Mary to the regent deſired, that judges
                    might immediately be allowed to inquire into the legality of her marriage with
                    Bothwel: and that, if it was found to have been concluded in oppoſition to the
                    laws, it ſhould be declared void, and that the liberty be granted to her of
                    entering anew into a matrimonial engagement. The duke of Norfolk expreſſed to
                    the regent the gratitude he felt for his friendſhip; promiſed him the command of
                    the fulleſt exertions of his conſequence and power; intreated him to proceed
                    expeditiouſly in<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0081.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0075"
                    /> promoting the buſineſs of the marriage, and referred him to the inſtructions
                    of lord Boyd for a ſatisfactory anſwer to any doubts which might give him
                    diſguſt or uneaſineſs. By the letters of Throgmorton, the regent was advertiſed
                    that the marriage of the queen of Scots with the duke of Norfolk was a certain
                    and decided point; and he was counſelled to concur heartily and expeditiouſly in
                    this tranſaction, that his conſent might not ſeem to have been extorted.
                    Maitland of Lethington was recommended to him by this ſtateſman, as the perſon
                    whom he ſhould chooſe to repreſent him in the Engliſh court, as he could
                    negociate beſt the terms and mode of his ſecurity and of that of his party. In
                    ſine, Throgmorton intreated him not to be troubled with any preciſe ſcruples or
                    objections, for that his overthrow, if he reſiſted, would be inevitable; and, in
                    the view of his ſervices and cordiality, he aſſured him, that no man’s
                    friendſhip would be accepted with greater affection, and no man’s eſtimation be
                    higher or more fortunate. The zeal of Throgmorton induced him alſo, upon this
                    occaſion, to addreſs to Maitland a diſpatch, in which he was infinitely
                    importunate to haſten his expedition to England, in the character to which he
                    recommended him. He complimented him as the fitteſt perſon to open the match to
                    the Engliſh queen, on the part of the regent and the Scottiſh nobility; and he
                    repreſented the ſucceſs of the ſcheme to be infallible, as Elizabeth would never
                    be ſo unwiſe as to put her own ſafety, the peace of her kingdom, and the
                    preſervation of her people, in competition with the partial devices that might
                    proceed from the vanity and the paſſions of any perſon whatſoever. He enumerated
                    the names of the Engliſh nobility who had confederated to promote the marriage.
                    He enlarged upon it as an expedient full of wiſdom, and as advantageous in the
                    higheſt degree to religion and the ſtate. He pointed out the laſting and
                    inſeparable connection of England and Scotland, as its happy and undoubted
                    conſequence. For, if James VI. ſhould die, the ſceptres of the two kingdoms
                    might devolve to an Engliſh prince; and if he ſhould attain to manhood, he might
                    many the daughter of the duke of Norfolk, and unite, in his perfon, the two
                    crowns.</p>
                <p>Theſe weighty diſpatches employed fully the thoughts of the regent. The calls of
                    juſtice and humanity were loud in the behalf of Mary; his engagements to Norfolk
                    were preciſe and definitive; and the commiſſion of Elizabeth afforded him the
                    command of the moſt important ſervices. But, on the other hand, the reſtoration
                    of Mary, and her marriage, would put an end for ever to his greatneſs; and,
                    amidſt all the ſtipulations which could be made for his protection, the enormity
                    of his guilt was ſtill haunting him with ſuſpicions and terror. His ambition and
                    his ſelfiſh ſenſibilities were an overmatch for his virtue. He practised with
                    his partisans to throw obſtacles in the way of the treaty and the marriage; and,
                    on the pretence of deliberating concerning the reſtoration of Mary, and on her
                    divorce from Bothwel, a convention of the eſtates was ſummoned by him to
                    aſſemble at Perth. To this aſſembly the letters of Elizabeth were recited; and
                    her propoſitions were conſidered in their order. The full reſtoration of Mary to
                    her dignity was accounted injurious to the authority of the king, and her
                    aſſociation with her ſon in the government was judged improper</p>
                <p>and dangerous; but it was thought that her deliverance from priſon, and her
                    reduction to a private ſtation, were reaſonable expedients. No definitive
                    decree, however, was pronounced. The letters of Mary were then communicated to
                    this council, and gave riſe to vehement debates. She had written and ſubſcribed
                    them in her character of queen of Scotland. This carriage was termed <hi
                        rend="italic">inſolent</hi> and <hi rend="italic">imperious</hi> by the
                    friends of the regent. They alſo held it unſafe to examine her re- queſts, till
                    they ſhould be communicated to Elizabeth; and they inſinuated, that ſome
                    inclement and partial device was concealed under the purpoſe of her divorce from
                    the earl of Bothwel. The favourers of Mary endeavoured to apologize for the form
                    of the letters, by throwing the blame upon her ſecretaries; and engaged, that
                    while the commiſſaries, or judges, were proceeding in the buſineſs of the
                    divorce, new diſpatches in the proper method ſhould be applied for and procured.
                    They were heard with evident ſymptoms of diſpleaſure; and exclaimed, “that it
                    was wonderful to them, that thoſe very perſons who lately had been ſo violent
                    for the ſeparation of the queen and Bothwel ſhould now be ſo averſe ſrom it.”
                    The partiſans of the regent replied, “that if the queen was ſo eagerly
                    ſolicitous to procure the divorce, ſhe might apply to the king of Denmark to
                    execute Bothwel as the murderer of her huſhand; and that then ſhe might marry
                    the peſon who was moſt agreeable to her.” The paſſions of the two factions were
                    inflamed to a moſt indecent extremity, and the convention broke up with ſtrong
                    and unequivocal marks of hoſtility and anger.</p>
                <p>Notwithſtandſhg the caution with which Mary and Norfolk carried on their
                    intrigues, intimations of them had come to Elizabeth. Norfolk himſelf, by the
                    advice of the earl of Pembroke, had ventured to diſcloſe his ſecret to Sir
                    William Cecil, who affected to be friendly to him. The regent, in anſwer to her
                    letters, tranſmitted to her the proceedings of the convention at Perth. The
                    application of Mary for a divorce was a key to the ambitious hopes of the duke
                    of Norfolk. She commanded Sir William Cecil to apply himſelf to diſcover the
                    conſpiracy. This ſtateſman betrayed the confidence with which he had been
                    entruſted; and Elizabeth, while the duke was attending her at Farnham,
                    diſcovering a mixture of pleaſantry and paſſion, admoniſhed him to be careful on
                    what pillow he repoſed his head. The earl of Leiceſter, alarmed by his fears,
                    revealed to her at Titchfield the whole proceedings of the duke of Norfolk and
                    his friends. Her fury was ungovernable; and at different times ſhe loaded
                    Norfolk with the ſevereſt reproaches and contumely, for preſuming to think of a
                    marriage with the queen of Scots without the fonction of her concurrence.
                    Inſulted with her diſcourſe and her looks, abandoned by Leiceſter, and avoided
                    by other nobles in whom he had confided, he felt his courage to forſake him. He
                    left the court at Southampton without taking his leave, and went to London to
                    the earl of Pembroke. New intimations of her diſpleaſure were announced to him,
                    and he retired to his ſeat at Kinninghall in Norfolk. His friends preſſed him to

                    depart from the fidelity which he owed to her; and that it was his fixed
                    reſolution to have applied for her conſent to his marriage with the queen of
                    Scots. In return, ſhe ordered him to repair to her court at Windſor; and, as he
                    appeared to be irreſolute, a meſſenger was diſpatched to take him into cuſtody.
                    He was firſt confined to the houſe of Paul Wentworth, at Burnham, in the
                    neighbourhood of Windſor, and then committed to the Tower. The earls of Pembroke
                    and Arundel, the lord Lumley, Sir Nicholas Throgmorton, and the biſhop of Roſs,
                    were alſo apprehended and confined.</p>
                <p>Elizabeth, amidſt the ferment of her inquietudes, forgot not to gratify her
                    revenge by inſulting the queen of Scots. The name of Mary was ſufficient to
                    convulſe her with anger. The earl of Huntingdon, who affected to have
                    pretenſions to the crown of England that were preferable to thoſe of the
                    Scottiſh princeſs, was joined with the earl of Shrewſhury in the office of
                    guarding her. His inſtructions were rigorous, and he was diſpoſed to exceed
                    them. The earl of Shrewſbury conſidered it as an indignity to have an aſſociate
                    who was a declared enemy to his charge, who had an intereſt in her death, and
                    who was remarkable for a natural ferocity of diſpoſition. Mary exclaimed againſt
                    the indelicacy and rudeneſs of Elizabeth, and proteſted that all her intentions
                    were commendable and innocent. Huntingdon took a delight in her ſufferings. He
                    ranſacked her coffers with a view of making diſcoveries; but her prudence had
                    induced her to deſtroy all the evidences of her tranſactions with the duke of
                    Norfolk; and the officious aſſiduity of this jailor was only rewarded with two
                    cyphers which he could not comprehend. The domeſtics whom ſhe favoured were
                    ſuſpected and diſmiſſed. Her train of attendants was diminiſhed. An unrelenting
                    watch was kept upon her. No couriers were allowed to carry her diſpatches. No
                    meſſengers were admitted to her preſence; and all the letters from her friends
                    were ordered to be intercepted, and to be conveyed to the queen of England.</p>
                <p>The proceedings of the convention at Perth were afflicting to Elizabeth, to Mary,
                    and to the duke of Norfolk. In the former they created ſuſpicions of the regent;
                    and they were a certain annunciation to the latter, that he was reſolved to
                    ſupport himſelf in the government of Scotland. Uncertain rumours had reached
                    Elizabeth of the interviews he had held with Norfolk in the buſineſs of the
                    marriage. Her ſurpriſe and indignation were infinite. Mr Wood, who brought from
                    the regent his anſwer to her letter, was treated with diſreſpect. Secretary
                    Cecil diſpatched inſtructions to the lord Hunſdon, the governor of Berwick, to
                    watch his operations with a jealous eye. Elizabeth, by a ſpecial envoy, required
                    from him an explanation of his ambiguous carriage. The regent, true to his
                    intereſts, apologized to her for his connections with the duke of Norfolk, by
                    laying open the deſign of that nobleman to cut him off, in his way to Scotland,
                    by a full communication of whatever had paſſed between them in relation to Mary,
                    and by offers of an unlimited ſubmiſſion and obedience.</p>
                <p>While the duke of Norfolk was carrying on his intrigues with Mary, the ſcheme of
                    an inſurrection for her deliverance was advancing under the direction of the
                    earls of Northumberland and Weſtmoreland. Motives of religion were the chief
                    foundation of this conſpiracy; and the more zealous Catholics over England were
                    concerned in it. Mary, however, by the advice of the duke of Norfolk, who was
                    afraid of her matching with a foreign prince, did not enter into it with
                    cordiality. It advanced notwithſtanding; and the agents of the pope were laviſh
                    of exhortations and donatives. The duke of Alva, by the order of his maſter the
                    king of Spain, encouraged the conſpirators with the offer of 20,000 men from the
                    Netherlands; and, under the pretence of adjuſting commercial diſputes, he ſent
                    into England Chiapini Vitelli marquis of Celona, an officer of ability, that he
                    might be at hand, and prepare to take the command of them.—- The report of an
                    inſurrection was univerſal. Elizabeth kept an army of 15,000 men near her
                    perſon. The queen of Scots was removed to Coventry, a place of great ſtrength;
                    and if a ſuperior and commanding force ſhould appear before it, her ferocious
                    keeper, it is ſaid, had orders to aſſaſſinate her. Repeated commands were ſent
                    to the earls of Northumberland and Weſtmoreland, to repair to court. But the
                    impriſonment of the duke of Norfolk and his friends had ſtruck a panic into
                    them. They conceived that their conſpiracy was diſcovered; and putting
                    themſelves at the head of their followers, they iſſued their manifeſto. The
                    reſtoration of Popery, the eſtabliſhment of the titles of Mary to the Engliſh
                    crown, and the reformation of abuſes in the commonwealth, were the avowed
                    objects of their enterpriſe. But they had embarked in a buſineſs for which they
                    were altogether unequal. Their efforts were feeble and deſultory. The duke of
                    Alva forgot his promiſes. Wherever the peace was diſturbed by inſurgents, there
                    were troops to oppoſe them. The vigilance of Elizabeth diſconcerted with eaſe
                    the operations of men whom no reſources or popularity could have conducted to
                    greatneſs, and who could neither conquer nor die. The earl of Weſtmoreland,
                    after concealing himſelf for ſome time in Scotland, effected an eſcape into
                    Flanders, where he paſſed a miſerable and uſeleſs exiſtence; and the earl of
                    Northumberland being taken by the regent, was impriſoned in the caſtle of
                    Lochleven.</p>
                <p>As the fury of Elizabeth abated, her reſentment to the duke of Norfolk loſt its
                    power; and ſhe failed not to diſtinguiſh between the intrigues of an honourable
                    ambition, and the practices of an obſtinate ſuperſtition. It was the reſult of
                    the examination of this nobleman, and of the confeſſions of the other priſoners,
                    that Lethington had ſchemed the buſineſs of the marriage, and that the earl of
                    Murray had encouraged it; that her conſent was underſtood to be neceſſary to its
                    completion; and that Mary herſelf had warmly recommended the expedient of
                    conſulting her pleaſure. Upon receiving proper admonitions, the earls of
                    Pembroke, Arundel, the lord Lumley, Sir Nicholas Throgmorton, and the biſhop of
                    Roſs, were releaſed from confinement; and, after a more tedious impriſonment,
                    the duke of Norfolk himſelf was admitted to his liberty. This favour, however,
                    was not extended to him till he had not only ſubmiſſively acknowledged his
                    preſumption in the buſineſs of the marriage; but had fully revealed whatever had
                    paſſed between Mary and him, and ſolemnly engaged himſelf never more to think of
                    this al-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0083.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0077"/>
                    liance, and never more to take any concern whatsoever in her affairs.</p>
                <p>The regent, in the meanwhile, was very anxious to recover the good opinion of
                    Elizabeth. Her treatment of Mr Wood, and her diſcovery of his practices, had
                    excited his apprehenſions. He therefore aſſembled at Stirling a convention of
                    the eſtates; and taking her letters a ſecond time into conſideration, returned
                    her a reply to them by Robert Pitcairn abbot of Dunfermline, in a ſtyle ſuited
                    to her temper and jealouſies, and from which ſhe could deciſively infer, that no
                    favour of any kind would be ſhown to the queen of Scots. But this baſe
                    condeſcenſion, though aſſiſted by his treachery to the duke of Norfolk, not
                    being ſufficient, in his opinion, to draw completely to him the cordiality of
                    the queen of England, he was preparing to gratify her with another ſacrifice.
                    The partiality of Maitland to Mary, and his intrigues with Norfolk and the
                    Engliſh malcontents, had rendered him uncommonly obnoxious to Elizabeth and her
                    miniſtry. The late commotions had been chiefly aſcribed to his arts; and it was
                    natural to dread new calamities and tumults from the fruitful ſpring of his
                    invention. Under the pretence of employing his ſervice in diſpatches to England,
                    the regent invited him to Stirling. He was then with the earl of Athol at Perth;
                    and ſuſpecting ſome improper device, he obeyed the ſummons with reluctance. When
                    he took his place in the privy-council, Captain Crawford, the minion of the earl
                    of Lenox, who had diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the trial of Mary, accuſed him, in
                    direct terms, of being a party in the murder of the late king. The regent
                    affected aſtoniſhment, but permitted him to be taken into cuſtody. He was ſoon
                    after lent to Edinburgh under a guard, and admoniſhed to prepare for his trial.
                    Upon ſimilar charges, the lord Seton and Sir James Balfour were ſeized upon and
                    impriſoned.</p>
                <p>Kirkaldy of Grange, the governor of the caſtle of f Edinburgh, who was warmly
                    attached to Maitland, after having remonſtrated in vain with the regent on the
                    violence of his conduct, employed addreſs and ſtratagem in the ſervice of his
                    friend. Under the cover of night, he went with a guard of ſoldiers to the
                    lodgeing where Maitland was confined; and ſhowing a forged warrant for taking
                    his perſon into keeping, got poſſeſſion of him. Kirkaldy had now in his cattle
                    the duke of Chatelherault, the lord Herries, and Maitland. The regent ſent for
                    him to a conference; but he refuſed to obey his meſſage. He put himſelf and his
                    fortreſs under the direction of his priſoners. The regent, condeſcending to pay
                    him a viſit, was more laviſh than uſual of his promiſes and kindneſs. His arts,
                    however, only excited the diſdain of this generous ſoldier. Since he could not
                    lead out Maitland to the block, he inſtituted a proceſs of treaſon againſt him,
                    in order to forfeit his eſtates. Kirkaldy, by the mouth of a trumpeter, deſired
                    him to commence ſimilar actions againſt the earl of Morton and Mr Archibald
                    Douglas, as it was notorious that they were parties to the king’s murder. This
                    meſſenger was like- wiſe charged with delivering a challenge from him to Mr
                    Archibald Douglas, and another from the lord Herries to the earl of Morton. This
                    diſappointment, and theſe indignities, made a deep impreſſion upon the regent;
                    and, in a thoughtful diſſatisſied. humour, a</p>
                <p>bout this time, he made a ſhort progreſs towards the Engliſh border, courting
                    popularity, and deſerving it, by an attention to order and juſtice.</p>
                <p>Elizabeth, flattered by his ſubmiſſive advances, and pleaſed with his ambition,
                    was now diſpoſed to gratify his fulleſt wiſhes; and ſhe perceived, that by
                    delivering to him the queen of Scots, ſhe would effectually relieve herſelf of a
                    priſoner whoſe vigour and intrigues were a conſtant interruption to her repoſe.
                    A treaty for this purpoſe was entered into and concluded. The regent was to
                    march an army to the Engliſh frontiers, and to receive from her his ſovereign
                    into her own dominions, the victim of his power, and the ſport of his paſſions.
                    No hoſtages and no ſecurity were ſtipulated for her entertainment and good
                    uſage. His authority over her was to be without any limits. Upon his part, he
                    was to deliver to Elizabeth the young prince, to put her in poſſeſſion of the
                    principal forts of Scotland, and to aſſiſt her with troops in the event of a war
                    with France. This treaty, ſo fatal to Mary, and ſo ruinous to the independence
                    of Scotland, eſcaped not the vigilance of the biſhop of Roſs. He complained of
                    it in the ſtrongeſt terms to Elizabeth; and declared it to be equivalent to a
                    ſentence of death againſt his miſtreſs. The ambaſſadors of France and Spain were
                    alſo ſtrenuous in their remonſtrances to her upon this ſubject. All reſiſtance,
                    however, was unavailing; and the execution of the treaty ſeemed inevitable. Yet
                    how vain are the loftieſt ſehemes of human pride! The career of the regent was
                    haſtening to its termination; and the hand of an aſſaſſin put a period to his
                    dream of royalty. Scotland did not loſe its liberties; but Mary continued to be
                    unfortunate.</p>
                <p>James Hamilton of Bothwelhaugh, who had been taken a priſoner at the battle of
                    Langſide, obtained his liberty and life; but his eſtates were forfeited. — His
                    wife, the heireſs of Woodhouſlie, retired upon this emergency to her paternal
                    inheritance, in the hope that it might eſcape the rapacity of the regent. He
                    had, however, given it away in a gift to one of his favourites, Sir James
                    Ballenden; and the inſtruments of his power having the inhumanity to ſtrip her
                    of her garments, and to turn her naked out of her houſe, in a cold and dark
                    night, ſhe became diſtracted before the morning. Hamilton vowed revenge; and the
                    regent made a mockery of his threats. This contempt inſpirited his paſſions; and
                    the humiliation of the houſe of Hamilton, to which he was nearly allied,
                    foſtered the eagerneſs of his diſcontents. The madneſs of party fermented in him
                    with the atroc;ouſneſs of rage. His mind reconciled itſelf to aſſaſſination.
                    After watching for ſome time a proper opportunity to commit his horrible
                    purpoſe, he found it at Linlithgow. The regent was to paſs through this town in
                    his way from Stirling to Edinburgh. Intimations reached him that Hamilton was
                    now to perpetrate his deſign: and he unaccountably neglected them. The affaſſin,
                    in a houſe that belonged to the archbiſhop of St Andrew’s, waited deliberately
                    his approach; and firing his muſket from a window, ſhot him through the body.
                    The wound, when examine, was not judged to be mortal; but the regent finding its
                    pain to increaſe, prepared himſelf for death; and in a few hours after he
                    expired. A fleet horſe of the abbot of Arbroath’s carried the affaſſin to the
                    palace of Hamilton; and<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0084.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0078"/> from thence he ſoon after effected his eſcape
                    into France.</p>
                <p>The death of the earl of Murray made no favourable alteration in the affairs of
                    Mary. Confusion and diſorder prevailed throughout the kingdom; and though the
                    friends of the queen were promiſed aſſiſtance from France, nothing effectual was
                    done for them. At laſt the regency was conferred upon the earl of Lenox an enemy
                    to his queen, and who treated her friends with the utmoſt rigour. At the ſame
                    time Elizabeth continued to amuſe with negociations her unhappy rival. She
                    granted liberty to the biſhop of Roſs to repair to the queen of Scots, who had
                    been removed to Chatſworth, and to confer with her on the ſubject of the
                    intended accord and treaty. Mary, conforming to the advances of Elizabeth,
                    authoriſed the lord Levingſton to paſs to her dominions, and to deſire her
                    friends to appoint a deputation of their number to give their aſſiſtance in
                    promoting the ſalutary purpoſe of eſtabliſhing the tranquillity of their
                    country: and after meeting with ſome interruptions upon the Engliſh borders from
                    the earl of Suſſex, this nobleman executed ſucceſsfully his commiſſion. The
                    queen’s lords gave powers to ten nobles to act in a body, or by two of their
                    number, in the intended negociation: and a ſafe-conduct from Elizabeth allowed
                    them to enter the Engliſh realm, and to remain in it during the ſpace of fix
                    months.</p>
                <p>While the lord Levingſton was conſulting the intereſts of Mary with her friends
                    in Scotland, the biſhop of Roſs was making earneſt ſuit with Elizabeth to
                    proceed in the projected negociation. His ſolicitations were not ineffectual;
                    and Sir William Cecil and Sir Walter Mildmay received the inſtructions of their
                    miſtreſs to wait upon the queen of Scots at Chatſworth. The heads of
                    accommodation which they propoſed were explicit and particular and the rigour
                    they diſcovered towards the Scottiſh princeſs ſeemed to vouch their ſincerity.
                    It was propoſed, that a perfect amity ſhould take place between the two queens;
                    that all the treaties which had formerly been concluded by the two nations
                    ſhould receive an ample confirmation; that the queen of Scots ſhould ratify the
                    treaty of Edinburgh, and forbear from advancing any title or claim to the crown
                    of England during the life of Elizabeth, or to the prejudice of the heirs of her
                    body; that in caſe of foreign invaſions, the two realms ſhould mutually aſſiſt
                    each other; that all foreign ſoldiers ſhould be ordered to depart out of
                    Scotland; that in the future, ſtrangers of the profeſſion of arms ſhould be
                    prohibited from repairing to it, and from taking up their reſidence in any of
                    its caſtles or houſes of ſtrength; that Mary ſhould hold no correſpondence,
                    directly or indirectly, with any ſubject of England, without the permiſſion of
                    the Engliſh queen; that the earl of Northumberland, and the Engliſh rebels in
                    Scotland, ſhould be delivered up to Elizabeth; that redreſs ſhould be given to
                    the ſubjects of England for the ſpoils committed upon them by the Scottiſh
                    borderers; that the murderers of the lord Darnley and the earl of Murray ſhould
                    be duly and effectually puniſhed; that before the queen of Scots ſhould be ſet
                    at liberty, the young prince her ſon ſhould be brought into England, and that he
                    ſhould continue in the keeping of Elizabeth till the death of his mother, or
                    till her reſignation to him of her crown on at</p>
                <p>taining his majority; that the queen of Scots ſhould not enter into a negociation
                    for her marriage without the knowledge of the queen of England, nor conclude it
                    without her approbation, or that of the greateſt part of the Scottiſh nobility;
                    that none of the ſubjects of Scotland ſhould be ſuffered to go to Ireland
                    without the ſafe-conduct of Elizabeth; and that Mary ſhould deliver to her
                    ſiſter all the teſtimonies and writings which had been ſent from France,
                    renouncing and diſavowing the pretended marriage between her and the duke of
                    Anjou. Beſides theſe articles of agreement, it was propoſed by another treaty to
                    adjuſt the differences of the queen of Scots and her ſubjects; and Sir William
                    Cecil and Sir Walter Mildmay embraced the preſent opportunity of conferring with
                    her upon this buſineſs, under the pretence of facilitating its management in the
                    future ſtages of its progreſs.</p>
                <p>During their ſtay at Chatſworth, theſe ſtateſmen were completely ſatisfied with
                    the behaviour of the queen of Scots. The candour, ſincerity, and moderation,
                    which fhe diſplayed, were full aſſurances to them that upon her part there was
                    no occaſion to apprehend any improper policy or art; and the calamities of her
                    condition were a ſtill ſecurer pledge of her compliance. Elizabeth, upon hearing
                    their report, affected to be highly pleaſed with her ſiſter, and ſent a meffage
                    to the earl of Lenox, inſtructing him in the conditions which had been ſubmitted
                    to Mary; and deſiring him to diſpatch commiſſioners into England to deliberate
                    in the treaty, and to conſult his intereſt and that of his faction. Nor did Mary
                    neglect to tranſmit to her friends in Scotland the propoſed terms of agreement;
                    and the biſhop of Roſs, who had aſſiſted her in the conferences with Sir William
                    Cecil and Sir Walter Mildmay, conveyed intimations of them to the pope, the king
                    of France, and the duke of Alva; beſought their advice, and informed theſe
                    princes, that unleſs an effectual relief could be expected from their favour,
                    the neceſſities of her condition would compel her to ſubſcribe to the hard and
                    humiliating dictates of the queen of England.</p>
                <p>But while Mary and her friends were indulging the hope of a termination to her
                    troubles, Elizabeth was ſecretly giving comfort to her adverſaries, and
                    encouraging them to throw obſtacles in the way of the treaty. Sir William Cecil
                    wrote to the regent, expreſsing his diſapprobation of the negociations at
                    Chatſworth; deſiring him not to be apprehenſive of the boaſtings of the
                    adherents of the queen of Scots; and adviſing him to make choice of
                    commiſſioners, in the name of the king, in whoſe conſtancy and fortitude he
                    could rely, and whom no addreſs could allure from his intereſt, or from the
                    common cauſe in which he and his friends were embarked. The earl of Suſſex alſo
                    ſent him diſpatches, in which he admoniſhed him to turn his anxious attention to
                    the approaching negociation, and to inſiſt on ſecure ſtipulations for the
                    preſervation of the prince, for his own ſafety, and for a general indemnity to
                    the nobles and their adherents, whoſe party he had eſpouſed. In every event, he
                    repreſented it as proper for him to pay the greateſt reſpect to Elizabeth; and,
                    if no treaty ſhould be concluded, he adviſed him to be prepared for reducing the
                    friends of Mary to obedience, and for defending himſelf againſt invaſions from
                    abroad. By theſe artifices, the regent and his<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0085.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0079"/> faction were
                    inclined to intimate to Elizabeth their warm diſſatisfaction with the terms of
                    agreement which ſhe had propoſed to Mary; and Pitcairn abbot of <hi
                        rend="italic">D</hi> unfermline, who had been appointed ſecretary of Rate in
                    the room of Maitland of Lethington, was deputed to her upon this buſineſs. He
                    exclaimed againſt the treaty as wild and impolitic; and contended, that no
                    ſtipulations could bind Mary, whoſe religion taught her to keep no faith with
                    heretics; that her claims to the Engliſh crown, and her reſentment againſt the
                    queen of England, as well as her own ſubjects, would immediately upon her
                    reſtoration, involve the two kingdoms in blood; and that no peace or quiet could
                    be expected or enjoyed, but by adhering to the ſalutary maxim of detaining her
                    in a ſure and cloſe captivity. Elizabeth did not diſcourage theſe inclement
                    ſentiments; and Pitcairn was aſſured by her, that from her natural love to the
                    king, and her regard to the nobles who upheld his authority, ſhe would
                    faithfully provide for their ſecurity; and that if juſtice ſhould appear
                    deciſively upon their ſide, ſhe would even ſtrenuouſly maintain their quarrel
                    and their conſequence.</p>
                <p>Mary had been carried to Sheffield, and was recovering from a feveriſh
                    indiſpoſition. To this place the biſhop of Galloway and the lord Levingſton, who
                    had been ſelected by her friends to be her acting deputies in England, repaired
                    in order to impart to her the ſtate of affairs in Scotland, and to receive her
                    commands. After repeated conferences on the ſubject of the approaching treaty,
                    ſhe gave them her commiſſion and inſtructions, and joining them to the biſhop of
                    Roſs, ſent them to Elizabeth. They claimed an audience of this princeſs, and
                    were admitted to it at Hampton-court. Having preſented their credentials, they
                    informed her, that they were ready to conclude a treaty of concord and
                    agreement, upon principles the molt extenſive and liberal; and, repreſenting to
                    her the impoveriſhed and tumultuous ſtate of their country, they begged her to
                    proceed in the buſineſs with expedition. The orders, they ſaid, which they had
                    received, and their own inclinations, diſpoſed them to follow her advice and
                    counſel in all points which were honourable and conſiſtent with reaſon; and as
                    her protection was the only refuge of the adverſaries of their queen, they took
                    the liberty to obſerve, that it was completely in her power to put a period to
                    all diſturbances and animoſity, and to accompliſh an accord, which would not
                    only confer upon her the higheſt reputation, but be of the moſt ſignal utility
                    to the two kingdoms. Elizabeth declared, that it would pleaſe and flatter her in
                    no common degree to advance in the negociation; and that it was a pain to her
                    that the regent, by his delay in lending commiſſioners, ſhould diſcover any
                    averſion from it. This anſwer was deemed very favourable by the biſhop of Roſs
                    and his aſſociates; and they obtained her authority to diſpatch a meſſenger to
                    the regent to haften his operations.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, Mary received diſpatches from the pope, the king of France, and
                    the duke of Alva; and they concurred in recommending it to her to accept of the
                    articles of accommodation which were offered by Elizabeth. The Turk was giving
                    employment to the pope and the king of Spain; Charles IX. already enfeebled by
                    the obſtinate valour of the Huguenots, was buſy in deceiving them with
                    appearances of peace, and</p>
                <p>in plotting their overthrow; and the duke of Alva felt himſelf inſecure in his
                    government of the Netherlands. But while they ſtrongly adviſed Mary to conclude
                    an agreement with the queen of England, they were yet laviſh to her of their
                    expreſſions of a conſtant amity; and if the treaty ſhould miſcarry, they
                    promiſed to make the moſt ſtrenuous exertions in her behalf, and to aſſiſt her
                    adherents with money, ammunition, and troops.</p>
                <p>The earl of Morton, the abbot of Dunfermline, and Mr James Macgill, had been
                    appointed by the regent and his faction to be their commiſſioners in the name of
                    the king; and at length their arrival was announced to Elizabeth. Conforming to
                    the ſpirit of their party, the earl of Morton and his colleagues took an early
                    opportunity to juſtify to her the depoſition of the queen of Scots, and by this
                    means to interrupt the progreſs of the treaty. In an elaborate memorial, they
                    affected to conſider Mary as unworthy to reign, and aſſerted the conſtitutional
                    power of the people to curb her ambition, and to throw her down from royalty.
                    They endeavoured to intrench themſelves within the authority of laws, civil,
                    canon, and municipal; and they recited opinions to her prejudice by many pious
                    divines. But though the general poſition, that the people have a title to reſiſt
                    the domination of the ſovereign is clear and undubitable; yet their application
                    of it to the queen of Scots was wildly precarious and improper. To ſpeak of her
                    tyranny, and her violation of the rights of her people, was even a wanton
                    mockery of truth and juſtice; for inſtead of having aſſumed an illegal
                    exorbitancy of power, ſhe had ſuffered in her own perſon and rights, and had
                    been treated by her ſubjects with the moſt cruel and tyrannical inlolence.
                    Elizabeth, who was unwilling and afraid to enter anew into the conduct of Mary,
                    who was fully ſenſible of the inſolence of her adverſaries, and who did not
                    approve of any maxims that preſſed againſt the majeſty ot princes, received
                    their memorial with ſurpriſe and indignation. She perceived not, ſhe told them,
                    any reaſon that could vindicate the ſeverity Which had been ſhown to the queen
                    of Scots by her enemies; and adviſed them to conſider, that in the preſent
                    negociation it was their proper buſineſs to conſult the ſecurity of the king and
                    of their faction.</p>
                <p>Upon the part of Elizabeth, the commiſſioners were the lord keeper Bacon, the
                    earls of Suſſex and Leiceſter, the lord Clynton, the lord chamberlain, Sir
                    William Cecil, who about this time was created lord Burleigh, Sir Francis
                    Knollys, Sir James Croft, Sir Walter Mildmay, and Sir Thomas Smith. The deputies
                    of Mary were invited to meet with the Engliſh commiſſorters in the houſe of the
                    lord keeper; and after he had ſtated the general purpoſes of the treaty, he
                    intimated to them, that there were two points which required a particular
                    diſcuſſion. A proper ſecurity, he ſaid, ought to be given by the queen of Scots
                    for her due performance of the ſtipulations of the agreement with Elizabeth; and
                    it was expedient to concert the mode of the pardon and indemnity which ſhe was
                    to extend to the ſubjects of Scotland who had offended her. As an aſſurance of
                    the accommodation with his miſtreſs, he demanded, that the duke of
                    Chatelherault, the earls of Huntley and Argyle, the lords Hume and Herries, with
                    another perſon of high rank, ſhould be ſurrendered to<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0086.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0080"/> her, and
                    remain in England for three years; that the caſtles of Dumbarton and Plume
                    ſhould be in her poſſeſſion during the ſame period; and as to the article
                    concerning the delivery of the prince into her cuſtody, he obſerved, that it
                    would be required from the regent, the queen of Scots not having the power of
                    its performance. The deputies of Mary, ſurpriſed with this language, intreated
                    the Engliſh delegates to reflect, that their queen, if deprived of the moſt
                    faithful of her nobles, and oſher ſtrongeſt ſorts, could have little deſire or
                    ambition to return to her own kingdom; for ſhe would thus be unable to protect
                    herſelf againſt the turbulence of her ſubjects, and be a ſovereign without
                    friends, and without ſtrength. They were inclined, they ſaid, to put their
                    commiſſion and powers to the fulleſt ſtretch, in order to gratify Elizabeth 5
                    and they would agree, that two earls and two barons ſhould be ſurrendered for
                    two years, as hoſtages of the fidelity of their ſovereign; under the
                    reſtriction, that they might be exchanged every ſix months for perſons of an
                    equal condition, if they ſhould be deſirous of returning to their own country.
                    As to the giving up of any forts or caſtles, they would not agree to it, becauſe
                    among the other inconveniences of this meaſure, ſimilar claims would be
                    competent to the king of France, by the ſpirit of the treaty of Edinburgh, which
                    ſtipulated, that no French or Engliſh troops ſhould be admitted into Scotland.
                    The lord keeper Bacon, reſuming his diſcourſe, told them, that the whole realm
                    of Scotland, its prince, nobles, and caſtles, were an inadequate pledge to the
                    queen of England; and that, if his advice would be followed, the queen of Scots
                    ſhould not obtain her liberty upon any kind of ſecurity which could be granted
                    by the Scottiſh nation. In all public treaties, ſaid the delegates of Mary, no
                    further aſſurance can be required from a ſovereign than what conſiſts with his
                    ſafety; and when exactions are preſſed from a contracting party in a league
                    which are ruinous and impoſſible, it is underſtood that a foundation is fought
                    to break off the negociation. The Engliſh commiſſioners, now interfering in a
                    body, declared upon their honour, that it was the meaning of Elizabeth to agree
                    to the reſtoration of the queen of Scots to her crown and realm upon receiving
                    ſufficient aſſurances for the articles of the accommodation; that the ſecurity
                    offered for her acceptance, ſhould be ſubmitted to her deliberation; and that
                    they would immediately proceed to confer with the deputies for the king of
                    Scots.</p>
                <p>The Engliſh commiſſioners were not unacquainted with the ſentiments of the earl
                    of Morton and his colleagues; and it was from this quarter that they expected a
                    reſolute and definitive interruption to the treaty. Nor did theſe delegates
                    diſappoint the expectations conceived of them. After affecting to take a
                    comprehenſive view of the articles under debate, they declared, that their
                    commiſſion gave them authority to treat about the amity of the two kingdoms, and
                    the maintenance of the true religion; but that it conferred upon them no power
                    to receive their queen into Scotland, or to ſurrender to Elizabeth the perſon of
                    their king. They therefore begged not to be urged to accede to a league which,
                    in ſome future period, might expoſe them to a charge of high treaſon.</p>
                <p>This Angular declaration was conſidered to be ſolid and weighty by the Engliſh
                    commiſſioners; and, in a</p>
                <p>new conference, it was communicated by them to the deputies of Mary. The biſhop
                    of Roſs and his aſſoiates were diſguſted with this formal impertinence. They did
                    not heſitate to pronounce the plea of an inſufficient commiſſion from the king
                    to his delegates to be an unworthy and moſt frivolous ſubterfuge. The authors,
                    they ſaid, of the depoſition of their ſovereign did not need any authority but
                    their own to ſet her at liberty; the prince was not yet five years of age, and
                    could give them no inſtructions: and the regent was wholly dependent upon the
                    will and pleaſure of the queen of England. It was repreſented in return by the
                    Engliſh delegates, that the commiſſion of king James to his deputies, having
                    been peruſed by Elizabeth, was accounted by her to be inſufficient; and that it
                    was her opinion, that the earl of Morton ſhould return to Scotland to hold a
                    parliament for obtaining new powers. The biſhop of Roſs exclaimed, that the
                    queen of Scots had been amuſed with deceitful promiſes, that the prudence of
                    Elizabeth had been corrupted by partial counſels, and that the allegations and
                    pretences held out for interrupting the negociation were affected and unreal.
                    The inſtructions, he ſaid, from his ſovereign to her commiſſioners, were to
                    negociate and to conclude, and not to trifle; and they would not by any means
                    conſent to protract, by artificial delays, a treaty which the queen of England,
                    if her intentions were ſincere and right, could immediately terminate upon
                    reaſonable and honourable terms. His ſpeech and his demeanour he acknowledged to
                    be free and open; and he beſought them to excuſe him, ſince, having been made an
                    inſtrument to abuſe his miſtreſs with falſe hopes, he could not but reſent the
                    indignity, and expreſs what he knew and what he felt. The Engliſh deputies,
                    addreſſing him and his colleagues, obſerved, that as the friends of Mary, and
                    thoſe of the king her ſon, could not come to an agreement, and as their queen
                    was refuſed the aſſurance ſhe expected, they held their commiſſion to be at an
                    end, and were no longer at liberty to negociate.</p>
                <p>The inſincerity of Elizabeth, and the failure of the league or agreement, filled
                    Mary with reſentment and complaints. Her animoſities, and thoſe of Elizabeth,
                    were increaſed and fortified. She was in haſte to communicate to her allies the
                    unworthy treatment ſhe had received; and ſhe ſent her commands to her adherents
                    in Scotland to riſe up in arms, to repoſe no truſt in truces which were
                    prejudicial and treacherous, and to employ all their reſources and ſtrength in
                    the humiliation of the regent and his faction. Elizabeth, who by this time
                    apprehended no enterpriſe or danger from Charles IX. or the duke of Alva,
                    reſolved, on the other hand, to give a ſtrong and effectual ſupport to the
                    king’s friends, and to diſunite by ſtratagem, and oppreſs by power, the
                    partizans of the Scottiſh princeſs. The zeal of the biſhop of Roſs having railed
                    her anger, ſhe commanded him to depart from London; and Mary, in contempt of her
                    mandate, ordered him to remain there under the privilege of her ambaffador. The
                    high and unbroken ſpirit of the Scottiſh queen, in the midſt of her misfortunes,
                    never once awakened the generous admiration, of Elizabeth. While it uniformly
                    inflamed her rage, it ſeems alſo to have excited her terror. With a
                    puſillanimous meanneſs, ſhe ſent a diſpatch to the earl of Shrewſbury,
                    inſtructing him to keep his charge in the<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0087.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0081"/> cloſeſt confinement, and to be inceſſantly on
                    his guard to prevent her eſcape. He obeyed, and regretted her ſeverity. The
                    expence, retinue, and domeſtics, of the queen of Scots, were diminiſhed and
                    reduced, and every probable means by which ſhe might endeavour to obtain her
                    liberty were removed from her. The rigours, however, that invaded her perſon
                    could not reach her mind; and ſhe pitied the tyrant that could add contumely to
                    oppreſſion, and deny her even the comforts of a priſon.</p>
                <p>All this time Scotland was involved in the miſeries of civil war. The friends of
                    Mary were everywhere puniſhed with fines and forfeiture. Private families took
                    the opportunity of the public confuſion to revenge their quarrels againſt each
                    other. Individuals of every denomination ranged themſelves on the ſide either of
                    the regent or of the queen, and took a ſhare in the hoſtilities of their
                    country. Fathers divided againſt ſons, and ſons againſt their fathers, Acts of
                    outrage and violence were committed in every quarter, while, amidſt the general
                    confuſion, religion was made the pretence by both parties.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, though many encounters took place between the two factions, yet
                    neither party ſeems to have been conducted by leaders of any ability or ſkill in
                    military affairs. Thus year, in one of theſe ſkirmiſhes, the regent himſelf was
                    taken priſoner by a party of the queen’s faction, and put to death. But this
                    event made little alteration in the affairs of the nation. The earl of Marre,
                    another of the queen’s enemies, was choſen to the regency: but though he
                    propoſed to act againſt her party with rigour, he was baffled before Edinburgh
                    caſtle, which was ſtill held by her friends; and ſome bloody ſkirmiſhes were
                    fought in the north, where victory declared in favour of the queen. Theſe
                    advantages, however, were more than compenſated to the other party by the
                    following event.</p>
                <p>While the negociations with Elizabeth for Mary’s reſtoration were depending, the
                    ſcheme of a conſpiracy for her deliverance was communicated to her by Robert
                    Ridolphi a Florentine, who lived in London many years as a merchant, and who was
                    ſecretly an agent for the court of Rome. But to his letters, while the fate of
                    the treaty was uncertain, ſhe returned no reply. Its miſcarriage, through the
                    duplicity of Elizabeth, recalled them forcibly to her attention, and ſtimulated
                    her to ſeek the accompliſhment of her liberty by meaſures bolder and more
                    arduous than any which had been hitherto employed by her. She drew up in cipher
                    an ample diſcourfe of his communications and of her ſituation, and diſpatched it
                    to the biſhop of Roſs, together with letters for the duke of Norfolk. Her
                    inſtructions to this eccleſiaſtic were to convey the diſcourſe and letters
                    expeditiouſly to Norfolk, and to concert an interview between that nobleman and
                    Ridolphi. The confidential ſervants by whom the duke acted with the biſhop of
                    Roſs were Banniſter and Barker; and having received from them the diſcourſe and
                    the letters, they were deciphered by Hickford his ſecretary. Having conſidered
                    them maturely, he delivered them to Hickford, with orders to commit them to the
                    flames. His orders, however, were diſobeyed; and Hickford depoſited them, with
                    other papers of conſequence, under the mats of the duke’s bedchamber. The
                    contents of the diſcourfe and the let</p>
                <p>ters awakening the hope and ambition of Norfolk, he was impatient to ſee
                    Ridolphi; and the biſhop of Roſs ſoon brought them together. Ridolphi, whoſe
                    ability was inſpirited by motives of religion and intereſt, exerted all his
                    eloquence and addreſs to engage the duke to put himſelf at the head of a
                    rebellion againſt his ſovereign. He repreſented to him, that there could not be
                    a ſeaſon more proper than the preſent for atchieving the overthrow of Elizabeth.
                    Many perſons who had enjoyed authority and credit under her predeceſſor were
                    much diſguſted; the Roman Catholics were numerous and incenſed; the younger ſons
                    of the gentry were languiſhing in poverty and inaction in every quarter of the
                    kingdom; and there were multitudes diſpofed to inſurrection from reſtleſſneſs,
                    the love of change, and the ardour of enterpriſe. He inſinuated to him, that his
                    rank, popularity, and fortune, enabled him to take the command of ſuch perſons
                    with infinite advantage. He inſiſted upon hie impriſonment and the outrages he
                    had ſuſtained from Elizabeth; repreſented the contempt to which he would expoſe
                    himſelf by a tame ſubmiſſion to wrongs; extolled the propriety with which he
                    might give way to his indignation and revenge; and painted out the glory he
                    might purchaſe by the humiliation o his enemies, and by the full accompliſhment
                    of his marriage with the queen of Scots. To give a ſtrength and confirmation to
                    theſe topics, he produced a long lift of the names of noblemen and gentlemen
                    with whom he had. practiſed, and whom he affirmed to he ready to hazard their
                    lives and riches for a revolution in the ſtate, if the duke would enter into it
                    with cordiality. To fix deciſively the duke, he now opened to him the
                    expectations with which he might flatter himſelf from abroad. The pope, he
                    aſſured him, had already provided 100,000 crowns for the enterpriſe; and if
                    Popery ſhould be advanced in England, he would cheerfully defray the whole
                    charges of the war. The king of Spain would ſupply 4000 horſe and 6000 foot,
                    which might be lauded at Harwich. Charles IX was devotedly attached</p>
                <p>to the queen of Scots, notwithſtanding the treaty which had been entered upon
                    with Elizabeth for her marriage with his brother the duke of Anjou: and when he
                    ſhould diſcover that, on the part of the Engliſh princeſs, this matrimonial
                    ſcheme was no better than a device or a mockery, he would renounce the
                    appearance of friendſhip he had aſſumed, and return to his natural, ſentiments
                    of diſdain and hatred with redoubled violence. In fine, he urged, that while he
                    might depend on the aſſiſtance and arms of the greateſt princes of Chriſtendotn,
                    he would intitle himſelf to the admiration of all of them by his magnanimous
                    efforts and generous gallantry in the cauſe of a queen ſo beautiful and ſo
                    unfortunate.</p>
                <p>The duke of Norfolk, allured by appearances ſo plauſible and flattering, did not
                    ſcruple to forget the duties of a ſubject, and the ſubmiſſive obligation in
                    which he had bound himſelf to Elizabeth never more to interfere in the affairs
                    of the Scottiſh princeſs. Ridolphi, in this forward ſtate of the buſineſs,
                    adviſed him to addreſs letters to the Pope, the king of Spain, and the duke of
                    Alva, expreſſive of his concurrence in the deſign, and inſpiriting their
                    activity and reſolutions. He even produced diſpatches framed for this purpoſe
                    and while he intreated the duke to ſubſcribe them, he offered to carry them
                    himſelf to Flanders,<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0088.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0082"/> Rome, and Spain. The duke of Norfolk, who was
                    ambitious and timid, diſpoſed to treaſon, and unfit for it, heſitated whether he
                    ſhould ſubſcribe the letters; and at length refuſed to proceed to that
                    extremity. He yet allowed the biſhop of Roſs, and Barker his ſervant, to go to
                    the Spaniſh ambaſſador to expreſs his approbation of the meaſures of Ridolphi,
                    to acknowledge that the letters were according to his mind, and to empower this
                    ſtateſman to certify their authenticity to his court. Ridolphi, full of hopes,
                    ſet out to execute his commiſſion. He paſſed firſt to the duke of Alva, to whom
                    he communicated the tranſactions in which he had been engaged, and with whom he
                    held many conferences. There was at this time at Bruxelles Charles Bailly, a
                    ſervant of the queen of Scots; and Ridolphi, after diſcloſing to him his
                    proceedings with Alva, entruſted him with letters to her to the duke of Norfolk,
                    the Spaniſh ambaſſador, and the biſhop of Roſs. When this meſſenger reached
                    Calais, a letter was delivered to him from the biſhop of Roſs, deſiring him to
                    leave his diſpatches with the governor of that place. From inexperience and
                    vanity he neglected this notice; and being ſearched at Dover, his letters,
                    books, and clothes were ſeized, and he himſelf was ſent to London, and
                    impriſoned in the Marſhalſea. The biſhop of Roſs, full of apprehenſions, applied
                    to lord Cobham, the warden of the cinque ports, who was friendly to the duke of
                    Norfolk; and obtaining by his means the packet of diſpatches from Ridolphi, he
                    ſubſtituted another in its place, which contained letters of no danger or
                    uſefulneſs. He had alſo the dexterity to convey intelligence of this trick to
                    Bailly, and to admoniſh him to preſerve a profound ſilence, and not to be
                    afraid. This ſimple and unpractiſed agent had, however, excited ſuſpicions by
                    the ſymptoms of terror he had exhibited upon being taken, and by exclaiming,
                    that the diſpatches he brought would involve his own deſtruction and that of
                    others. At his firſt examination he confeſſed nothing: but being ſent to the
                    tower, and put upon the rack, he revealed his converſations with Ridolphi, and
                    declared, that the diſpatches which he had brought had been delivered to the
                    biſhop of Roſs. An order was granted for taking the biſhop into cuſtody. Having
                    been aware, however, of his perilous ſituation, his houſe was ſearched in vain
                    for treaſonable papers; and he thought to ſcreen himſelf from anſwering any
                    interrogatories under the ſanctity of his character as the ambaſſador of an
                    independent princeſs.</p>
                <p>An unexpected incident excited, in the meanwhile, new ſuſpicions and alarms. Mary
                    being deſirous of tranſmitting 2000 crowns to the lord Herries to advance her
                    intereſts in Scotland, the duke of Norfolk undertook to convey it to him with
                    ſafety. He intruſted it to the charge of his confidents Hickford and Barker, who
                    putting it into a bag with diſpatches from their matter to lord Herries, ordered
                    a ſervant called <hi rend="italic">Brown</hi> to carry it to Banniſter; who,
                    being at this time on the border, could forward it to Scotland. Brown,
                    ſuſpicious or corrupted, inſtead of proceeding on his errand, carried the bag
                    and its contents to Sir William Cecil, now lord Burleigh. The privy-council,
                    deeming it treaſon to ſend money out of the realm for the uſe of the friends of
                    Mary, whom they affected to conſider as enemies, ordered Hickford and Barker to
                    be apprehended. The rack extorted from them whatſoever they knew to the
                    prejudice of their maſter. Hickford gave intelligence of the fatal diſcourſe and
                    the letters from Mary, which he had preſerved in oppoſition to the orders given
                    to him. All the proceedings between the queen of Scots, the duke of Norfolk, the
                    biſhop of Roſs, and Ridolphi, were brought to light. A guard was placed upon the
                    houſe of the duke of Norfolk, in order to prevent his eſcape. Sir Ralph Sadler,
                    Sir Thomas Smith, Sir Henry Nevil, and Dr Wilfon, were commiſſioned to examine
                    him; and being impreſſed with the belief that the diſcourſe and the letters had
                    been deſtroved, he poſitively denied that he had any concern in the affairs of
                    the queen of Scots, or any knowledge of them whatſoever. He was committed to the
                    tower a cloſe priſoner. Banniſter by this time was taken; and he confirmed the
                    relations of Hick- ford and Barker. In the courſe of their diſcoveries, there
                    appeared reaſons of ſuſpicion againſt many perſons of rank and diſtinction. The
                    earls of Arundel and Southampton, the lord Cobham, Mr Thomas Cobham his brother,
                    Sir Thomas Stanley, Sir Henry Percy, and other gentlemen who were friendly to
                    the queen of Scots and the duke of Norfolk, were ordered to be lodged in
                    different priſons; and the rack, and the expectation of a pardon, drew from them
                    the fulleſt confeſſions. The duke was altogether unable to defend himſelf. The
                    concurring teſtimonies of his friends and ſervants, with the diſcourſe and the
                    letters, which he fondly imagined had been committed to the flames, were
                    communicated to him. He was overwhelmed with amazement and diſtreſs; and
                    exclaimed, that he had been betrayed and undone. He made ample acknowledgments
                    of his guilt, and had no foundation of hope but in the mercy of his
                    ſovereign.</p>
                <p>By the confeſſion of the duke himſelf, and from all the inquiries which had been
                    made by the miniſters of Elizabeth, it appeared obvious beyond a doubt, that the
                    biſhop of Roſs had been the principal contriver of the conſpiracy. Ridolphi had
                    acted under his direction, and he had inſpirited the duke of Norfolk. He had
                    even proceeded to the extremity of adviſing that nobleman to put himſelf at the
                    head of a ſelect band of adherents, and to ſeize boldly the perſon of Elizabeth.
                    In his examinations he was treated with great rigour and inſult. But he made an
                    able defence, and peremptorily refuſed to make any anſwer to interrogatories.
                    The counſellors of Elizabeth were diſturbed with his obſtinacy; and having
                    certified him, that the rack would ſoon render him more pliant, he was ordered
                    into cloſe keeping in a dark apartment of the tower. When he had remained a few
                    days in this melancholy ſituation, four privy-counſellors, the lord admiral, the
                    lord Burleigh, Sir Francis Knollys, and Sir Thomas Smith, went to the tower, and
                    cauſed him to be brought to them to the lieutenant’s lodging. After having
                    aſſured him that he was charged by all the priſoners as the principal contriver
                    of the conſpiracy, they inſiſted, in the name of their ſovereign, that he ſhould
                    explain fully the part he had acted. The confeſſions of the duke of Norfolk and
                    his ſervants, of the lord Lumley, Sir Thomas Stanley, and other gentlemen, with
                    the diſcourſe and diſpatches of the queen of Scots, were ſet before him. They

                    upon their honour, that if he would make a free and open declaration of his
                    proceedings, it ſhould neither be employed againſt himſelf, nor againſt any
                    other perſon; but that if he ſhould continue to be reſolute in refilling to give
                    this ſatisfaction to their queen, who was anxious to ſearch the matter to the
                    bottom, they were inſtructed to let him know, that ſhe would abſolutely conſider
                    him as a private perſon, and order him to be tried and executed as a traitor. In
                    this extremity he accepted the conditions held out to him, and diſcloſed
                    minutely all the tranſactions of the principal parties in the conſpiracy. But
                    while he deſcribed the offences of his miſtreſs, the duke of Norfolk, and
                    himſelf, he could not avoid to detract from their blame by apologies. It was
                    natural, he ſaid, for the queen of Scots to exert the moſt ſtrenuous endeavours
                    in her power to recover her freedom and crown; and the methods ſhe adopted to
                    obtain her purpoſes ought to be conſidered in connection with the arts of
                    Elizabeth, who pertinaciouſly denied her acceſs to her preſence, who kept her a
                    cloſe priſoner in contempt of all the principles of humanity and juſtice, and
                    who afforded an open and powerful aſſiſtance to her enemies. The duke of Norfolk
                    he was earneſt to excuſe on the foundation of the advances which had been made
                    in his marriage with the queen oſ Scots. Their plighted love, and their
                    engagements, did not allow him to forſake her. As for himſelf, he was her
                    ambaſſador and her ſervant; and being highly indebted to her eneroſity and
                    kindneſs, he could not abandon her in captivity and diſtreſs without incurring
                    the guilt of the moſt ſinful treachery and ingratitude. The daring propoſal he
                    had made to ſeize the perſon of Elizabeth was the point, he obſerved, which
                    ſeemed to preſs upon him the moſt ſeverely; and he intreated them to believe,
                    that he had moved it only with the view of trying the courage of the duke of
                    Norfolk.— The privy-counſellors of Elizabeth were now in poſſeſſion of all the
                    evidence they could expect in this important buſineſs. Norfolk was admoniſhed to
                    prepare for his trial; and biſhop Leſly perceived, that though he might eſcape
                    with his life, he would never more be permitted to reſide in England, and to act
                    there as the ambaffador, the miniſter, and the friend of the queen of Scots.</p>
                <p>The defeat of the duke of Norfolk’s conſpiracy was a blow to Mary which ſhe could
                    never recover. Her moſt faithful friends were languiſhing in priſons upon her
                    account; ſhe had no longer the counſels oſ the biſhop of Roſs; and the Spaniſh
                    ambaſſador, who had entered into her concerns with an unſcrupulous cordiality,
                    had been ordered to withdraw from England. The trial and condemnation of Norfolk
                    ſoon followed, and plunged her into the moſt calamitous diſtreſs.</p>
                <p>The maſſacre of the Proteſtants at Paris in 1572 proved alſo extremely
                    detrimental to her. It was interpreted to be a conſequence of the confederacy
                    which had been formed at Bayonne for the extermination of the reformed. The
                    Proteſtants were everywhere tranſported with rage againſt the Papiſts. Elizabeth
                    prepared herſelf againſt an attack from the Roman Catholic powers; and was
                    haunted with the notion that they meant to invade her kingdom, and to give it to
                    the queen of Scots. Her ambaſſador at Paris, Sir Francis Walſingham, augmented
                    her apprehenſions and terror. He compared her weakneſs with the ſtrength of her
                    enemies, and aſſured her that if they ſhould poſſeſs themſelves of Scotland, ſhe
                    would ſoon ceaſe to be a queen. He rcpreſented Mary as the great cauſe of the
                    perils that threatened her perſonal ſafety and the tranquillity of her kingdom;
                    and as violent diſeaſes required violent remedies, he ſcrupled not to counſel
                    her to unite Scotland to her dominions, and to put to death a rival whoſe life
                    was inconſiſtent with her ſecurity. The more bigotted Proteſtants of Scotland
                    differed not very widely in their ſentiments from Sir Francis Walſingham; while
                    thoſe of them who were more moderate were ſtill more attached to their religion
                    than to Mary; and amidſt the indignation and horror into which the ſubjects of
                    Scotland were thrown by the ſanguinary outrages of Charles IX. and Catharine de
                    Medicis, they ſurveyed the ſufferings of their ſovereign with a diminiſhed
                    ſympathy.</p>
                <p>This year the regent, finding himſelf beſet with difficulties which he could not
                    overcome, and the affairs of the nation involved in confuſion from which he
                    could not extricate them, died of melancholy, and was ſucceeded by the earl of
                    Morton</p>
                <p>During the regency of the earl of Marre, a remarkable innovation took place in
                    the church, which deferves to be particularly explained, being no leſs than the
                    introduction of Epiſcopacy inſtead of the Preſbyterian form of worſhip. While
                    the earl of Lenox was regent, the archbiſhop of St Andrew’s was put to death,
                    becauſe he was ſtrongly ſuſpected to have had a concern in the death of the earl
                    of Murray; after which the earl of Morton procured a grant of the temporalities
                    of that ſee. Out of theſe he allotted a ſtipend to Mr John Douglas, a Proteſtant
                    clergyman, who took upon him the title of archbiſhop. This violence excited
                    cenſure and murmurs. In the language of the times, it was pronounced to be a
                    profanation of the kirk, and a high contempt of God; and it underwent the
                    ſcrutiny of the miniſtry in applications and complaints to the regent. The
                    matter was doubtleſs of too much importance to be overlooked; and a commiſſion
                    of privy-counſellors and clergymen was appointed in the name of the king to
                    inquire into it, and to reform and improve the policy of the church. This
                    commiſſion, upon the part of the privy-council, conſiſted of the earl of Morton,
                    the lord Ruthven, Robert abbot of Dunfermline, Mr James Macgill, Sir John
                    Ballenden, and Colin Campbell of Glenorchie; and upon the part of the church
                    there were named John Erſkine of Dun, and Mr John Winram, Mr Hay, Mr Lindſay, Mr
                    Pont, and Mr John Craig. The conſultations and debates were long; and the
                    influence and management of the earl of Morton directed their determinations. It
                    was reſolved, that till the majority of the king, or till the wiſdom of the
                    three eſtates ſhould be conſulted, the titles of archbiſhop and biſhop ſhould
                    continue as in the times which preceded the reformation; and that a chapter of
                    learned miniſters ſhould be annexed to every metropolitan or cathedral feat. It
                    was determined that the fees, as they became vacant, ſhould be given to thoſe of
                    the Proteſtant miniſtry who were moſt eminent for their qualifications; that the
                    archbiſhops and biſhops ſhould exerciſe no higher juriſdiction than what was
                    permitted to ſuperintendants; and that they ſhould be ſubject to the controul oſ
                    the general aſſemblies of the church. It was agreed, that all abbots, priors,
                        and<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0090.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0084"/> other
                    inferior prelates preſcnted to benefices, ſhould be examined by the biſhop or
                    ſuperintendant of the dioceſe or precinct where the preferment was ſituated; and
                    that their fitneſs to repreſent the church in parliament ſhould be duly inquired
                    into. It was judged that the king and the regent ſhould recommend qualified
                    perſons to vacant biſhoprics, and that the elections of them ſhould be made by
                    the chapters of the reſpective cathedrals. It was ordered that all benefices
                    with cure under prelacies ſhould only be diſpoſed of to officiating miniſters;
                    that every miniſter ſhould receive ordination from the biſhop of the dioceſe, or
                    the ſuperintendant of the province; and that the biſhops and ſuperintendants,
                    upon the ordination of miniſters, ſhould exact an oath from them to recognize
                    the authority of the king, and to pay canonical obedience to their ordinary in
                    all things that were lawful.</p>
                <p>By thefe artful regulations the earl of Morton did not mean ſolely to conſult his
                    own rapacity or that of the nobles. The exaltation of the Proteſtant church to
                    be one of the three eſtates was a conſequence of them; and the clergy being the
                    ſtrenuous enemies of Mary, he might by their means ſecure a decided influence in
                    parliament. The earl of Marre, as regent, giving his ſanction to the proceedings
                    of the commiſſion, they were carried into practice. The deluſive expectation of
                    wealth, which this revival of Epiſcopacy held out to the miniſtry, was
                    flattering to them; and they bore with tolerable patience this ſevere blow that
                    was ſtruck againſt the religious policy of Geneva. Mr John Douglas was deſired
                    to give a ſpecimen of his gifts in preaching; and his election took effect, not-
                    withſtanding the oppoſition that was made to it by John Knox and other
                    eccleſiaſtics, who flood up for the rules and forms which had been eſtabliſhed
                    at the reformation. He was inaugurated in his office by the biſhop of Caithneſs,
                    Mr John Spotſwood ſuperintendant of Lothian, and Mr David Lindſay, who violating
                    the book of diſcipline, communicated to him his character and admiſſion by the
                    impoſition of hands. This was a ſingular triumph to Epiſcopacy; and thc
                    exaltation of Douglas included other peculiarities remarkable and offenſive. He
                    denied that he had made any ſimoniacal agreement with the earl of Morton; yet it
                    was known that the revenues of the archbiſhopric were almoſt wholly ingroſſed by
                    that nobleman, he had promiſed to relign, upon his inſtalment, the office of
                    rector which he held in the univerſity of St Andrew’s: yet he refuſed to execute
                    this engagement. He was in a very advanced age; and his mental qualifications,
                    which had never been eminent, were in a ſtate of decay.</p>
                <p>A general aſſembly, which was holden at St Andrew’s, conſidering the high moment
                    of the new regulations introduced into the church, appointed commiſſioners to go
                    to John Knox, who was at this time indiſpoſed, and to conſult with him
                    deliberately in his houſe, whether they were agreeable to the word of God. But
                    from the arts of the nobles, or from the ſickneſs of Knox, it happened that this
                    conference was not carried into execution. In a general aſſembly, however, which
                    met at Perth, the new polity was reported and examined. The names of archbiſhop,
                    dean, arch-deacon, chancellor, and chapter, were excepted againſt as Popiſh
                    diſtinctions, and as ſlanderous to the ears of pious Chriſtians. A wiſh was
                    expreſſed that they might</p>
                <p>be exchanged for titles leſs profane and ſuperſtitious; and an unanimous
                    proteſtation was made, that the new polity was merely a temporary expedient, and
                    ſhould only continue and prevail till a more perfect order ſhould be obtained
                    from the king, the regent, and the nobility. This tolerating reſolution left the
                    new polity in its full force; and a colourable foundation was now eſtabliſhed
                    for the laity to partake in the profits of biſhoprics. The ſimoniacal paction of
                    Morton and Douglas was not long a matter of ſingularity. Mr James Boyd was
                    appointed to the archbiſhopric of Glaſgow, Mr James Paton to the b;ſhopric of
                    Dunkeld, and Mr Andrew Graham to the ſee of Dumblain; and theſe compromiſing
                    eccleſiaſtics, upon being allowed competencies to themſelves, gratified their
                    noble friends with the greateſt proportion of their revenues. The virtue of the
                    common people approved not this ſpirit of traffic; and the biſhops of the new
                    polity were treated openly with reproach or with ridicule.</p>
                <p>The year 1572 is alſo remarkable for the death of John Knox, whoſe miſtaken zeal
                    had contributed not a little to bring upon the queen thoſe misfortunes with
                    which ſhe was now oppreſſed. Neither by his death, however, nor by the change of
                    the regency, could ſhe now be relieved. The earl of Morton was ſo much devoted
                    to Elizabeth, that he received particular inſtructions from her how to guide the
                    young king. His elevation, indeed, gave the finiſhing ſtroke to the queen’s
                    affairs. He employed himſelf with ſucceſs in dividing her party among
                    themſelves, and by his means the duke of Chatelherault and the earl of Huntley
                    were induced to forſake her. As for Elizabeth, ſhe was bent on putting Mary to
                    death; but as no crime could be alleged againſt her in England, ſhe thought it
                    proper that ſhe ſhould be carried back to ſuffer death in her own dominions.
                    This propofol, however, was rejected; and the friends who remained true to Mary
                    once more began to indulge themſelves in hopes of ſuccours from France. New
                    misfortunes, however, awaited them.— The caſtle of Edinburgh, which had hitherto
                    been held for the queen by Kirkaldy of Grange, was obliged to ſurrender to an
                    Engliſh army commanded by Sir William Drury. Kirkaldy was ſolemnly aſſured by
                    the Englilh commander of his life and liberty; but Elizabeth violated this
                    capitulation, and commanded him to be delivered up to the regent. An hundred of
                    his relations offered to become vaſſals to Morton, and to pay him 3000 merks
                    yearly, if he would ſpare his life; but in vain: Kirkaldy and his brother Sir
                    James were hanged at Edinburgh. Maitland of Lethington, who was taken at the
                    ſame time, was poiſoned in the priſon houſe of Leith.</p>
                <p>The jealouſy of Elizabeth did not diminiſh with the decline of Mary’s cauſe. She
                    now treated her with more rigour than ever, and patroniſed Morton in all the
                    enormities which he committed againſt her friends. Leſly biſhop of Roſs had been
                    long impriſoned in England, on account of his concern in the duke of Norfolk’s
                    conſpiracy. Morton earneſtly ſolicited the queen to deliver him up, and would
                    undoubtedly have put him to death; but as he had acted in the character of
                    ambaſſador from Mary, this was judged impolitic, and the prelate was ſuffered to
                    depart for France. When he arrived there, he endeavoured in vain to ſtir up the
                    emperor, the pope, and the duke of Alva, to exert them-<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0091.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0085"/> ſelves in
                    behalf of the queen of Scotland; and, in 1574, the misfortunes of his royal
                    miſtrels were farther aggravated by the death of Charles IX. of France, and her
                    uncle the cardinal of Lorraine. The regent, in the mean time, ruled with the
                    moſt despotic ſway. He twice coined baſe money in the name of his ſovereign; and
                    after putting it into circulation the ſecond time, he iſſued orders for its
                    paſſing only for its intrinſic value. The duke of Chatelherault happening to die
                    this year, the regent took every method of ruining all thoſe of his name and
                    family. He committed to priſon all the Hamiltons, and every perſon of
                    diſtinction who had fought for the queen at the battle of Langſide, and
                    compelled them to buy their liberty at an exorbitant price. He inſtigated
                    Douglas of Lochleven to aſſaſſinate lord Arbroath, and it was with difficulty
                    that the latter eſcaped the ambuſh that was laid for him. Reid, the biſhop of
                    Orkney, having left his eſtate to pious and charitable uſes, the regent
                    prohibited the execution of the will, and took upon himſelf the adminiſtration.
                    To be rich was a ſufficient crime to excite his vengeance. He entered the
                    warehouſes of merchants, and confiſcated their property; and if he wanted a
                    pretence to juſtify his conduct, the judges and lawyers were ready at his
                    call.</p>
                <p>In this diſaſtrous period the clergy augmented the general confuſion. Mr Andrew
                    Melvil had lately returned from Geneva; and the diſcipline of its aſſembly being
                    conſideredby him as the moſt perfect model of eccleſiaſtical policy, he was
                    infinitely offended with the introduction of Epiſcopacy into Scotland. His
                    learning was conſiderable, and his ſkill in languages was profound. He was fond
                    of diſputation, hot, violent, and pertinacious. The Scottiſh clergy were in a
                    humour to attend to him; and his merit was ſufficient to excite their
                    admiration. Inſtigated by his practices, John Drury, one of the miniſters of
                    Edinburgh, called in queſtion, in a general aſſembly, the lawfulneſs of the
                    biſhops, and the authority of chapters in electing them. Melvil, after
                    commending his zeal and his motion, declaimed concerning the flouriſhing ſtate
                    of the eſtabliſhment of Geneva; and having recited the opinions of Calvin and
                    Beza upon eccleſiaſtical government, maintained, that there ſhould be no
                    office-bearers in the church whoſe titles were not ſeen in the book of God. He
                    affirmed, that the term <hi rend="italic">bishoρ</hi> was nowhere to be found in
                    it in the ſenſe in which it was commonly underſtood, as Chriſt allowed not any
                    ſuperiority among miniſters. He contended that Chriſt was the only lord of his
                    church, and that the miniſters of the word were all equal in degree and power.
                    He urged, that the eſtate of the biſhops, beſide being unlawful, had grown
                    unſeemly with corruptions; and that if they were not removed out of the church,
                    it would fall into decay, and endanger the intereſts of religion. His ſentiments
                    were received with flattering approbation; and though the archbiſhop of Glaſgow,
                    with the biſhops of Dunkeld, Galloway, Brechin, Dumblain, and the Iſles, were
                    preſent in this aſſembly, they ventured not to defend their vocation. It was
                    reſolved, that the name of</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">biſhop</hi> conferred no diſtinction or rank; that the office
                    was not more honourable than that of the other miniſters; and that by the word
                    of God their functions conſiſted in preaching, in adminiſtering the ſacraments,
                    and in exerciſing eccleſiaſtical diſcipline with the conſent of the elders. The
                    Epiſcopal eſtate, in the meanwhile, was watched with anxious obſervation; and
                    the faults and demerits of every kind, which were found in individuals, were
                    charged upon the order with rudeneſs and aſperity. In a new aſſembly this
                    ſubject was again canvaſſed. It was moved, whether biſhops, as conſtituted in
                    Scotland, had any authority tor their functions from the Scriptures? After long
                    debates, it was thought prudent to avoid an explicit determination of this
                    important queſtion. But a confirmation was bellowed upon the reſolution of the
                    former aſſembly; and it was eſtabliſhed as a rule, that every biſhop ſhould make
                    choice of a particular church within his dioceſe, and ſhould actually diſcharge
                    the duties of a miniſter.</p>
                <p>The regent, diſturbed with theſe proceedings of the brethren, was diſpoſed to
                    amuſe and to deceive them. He ſent a meſſenger to adviſe them not to infringe
                    and disfigure the eſtabliſhed forms; and to admoniſh them, that if their
                    averſion from Epiſcopacy was inſurmountable, it would become them to think of
                    ſome mode of eccleſiaſtical government to which they could adhere with
                    conſtancy. The aſſembly taking the advantage of this meſſage, made a formal
                    intimation to him, that they would diligently frame a laſting platform of
                    polity, and ſubmit it to the privy-council. They appointed, accordingly, a
                    committee of the brethren for this purpoſe. The buſineſs was too agreeable to be
                    neglected; and in a ſhort time Mr David Lindſay, Mr James Lawſon, and Mr Robert
                    Pont, were deputed to wait upon the regent with a new ſcheme of eccleſiaſtical
                    government. After reminding him, that he had been a notable infiniment in
                    purging the realm of Popery, and begging that he would conſnlt with them upon
                    any of its articles which he thought improper or incomplete, they informed him,
                    that they did not account it to be a perfect work to which nothing could be
                    added, or from which nothing could be taken away; for that they would alter and
                    improve it, as the Almighty God might farther reveal his will unto them. The
                    regent, taking from them their ſchedule, replied, that he would appoint certain
                    perſons of the privy-council to confer with them. A conference was even begun
                    upon the ſubject of their new eſtabliſhment; but from his arts, or from the
                    troubles of the times, no advances were made in it.</p>
                <p>This year the earl of Bothwel died in Denmark; and in his laſt moments, being
                    ſtung with remorſe, he confeſſed that he had been guilty of the king’s murder,
                    revealed the names of the perſons who were his accomplices, and with the moſt
                    ſolemn proteſtations declared the honour and innocence of the queen. His
                    confeſſion was tranſmitted to Elizabeth by the king of Denmark; but was
                    ſuppreſſed by her with an anxious ſolicitude.<note anchored="true" n="10"

                    himſelf obnoxious to the beſt part of the nobility, he was, in 1577, compelled
                    to reſign his office into the hands of James VI.; but as his majeſty was then
                    only twelve years of age, a general council of twelve peers was appointed to
                    aſſiſt him in the adminiſtration. Next year, however, the earl of Morton having
                    found means to gain the favour of the young king, procured the diſſolution of
                    this council; and thus being left the ſole adviſer of the king, he hoped once
                    more to be raiſed to his former greatneſs. This could not be done, however,
                    without keeping the king in a kind of captivity, ſo that nobody could have
                    acceſs to him but himſelf. The king, ſenſible of his ſituation, ſent a diſpatch
                    to the earls of Argyle and Athole, intreating them to relieve him. An army for
                    this purpoſe was ſoon raiſed; and Morton’s partiſans were in danger of being
                    defeated, had not the oppoſite party dreaded the vengeance of Elizabeth, who was
                    reſolved to ſupport the earl of Morton. In conſequence of this a negociation was
                    entered into, by which it was agreed, that the earl of Argyle, with ſome others,
                    ſhould be admitted into the king’s council; and that four noblemen ſhould be
                    choſen by each party to conſider of ſome proper method of preſerving
                    tranquillity in the nation.</p>
                <p>This pacification did not greatly diminiſh the power of Morton. He ſoon got rid
                    of one of his principal antagoniſts, the earl of Athole, by poiſoning him at an
                    entertainment; after which he again gave a looſe rein to his reſentments againſt
                    the houſe of Hamilton, whom he perſecuted in the moſt cruel manner. By theſe
                    means, however, he drew upon himſelf a general hatred; and he was ſupplanted in
                    the king’s favour by the lord d’Aubigney, who came from France in the year 1579,
                    and was created earl of Lenox. The next year Morton was ſuſpected of an
                    intention to deliver up the king to Elizabeth, and a guard was appointed to
                    prevent any attempts of this kind. The queen of England endeavoured to ſupport
                    her zealous partiſan; but without effect. He was tried, condemned, and executed,
                    as being concerned in the murder of Darnley. At the place of execution, it is
                    ſaid that he confeſſed his guilt; but of this the evidence is not quite
                    ſatisfactory. It is however certain that he acknowledged himſelf privy to the
                    plot formed againſt the life of the king; and when one of the clergymen
                    attending him before his execution obſerved, that by his own confeſſion he
                    merited death in foreknowing and concealing the murder, he replied "Ay but, Sir,
                    had I been as innocent as St Stephen, or as guilty as Judas, I muſt have come to
                    the ſcaffold. Pray, what ought I to have done in this matter? You knew not the
                    king’s weakneſs, Sir. If I had informed him of the plot againſt his life, he
                    would have revealed it even to his enemies and thoſe concerned in the deſign;
                    and I would, it may be, have loſt my own life, for endeavouring to preſerve his
                    to no purpoſe.”</p>
                <p>The elevation of king James, and the total overthrow of Morton, produced no
                    beneficial conſequences to the unfortunate Mary. In the year 1581, ſhe addreſſed
                    a letter to Caſtelnau the French ambaſſador, in which ſhe complained that her
                    body was ſo weak, and her limbs ſo feeble, that ſhe was unable to walk.
                    Caſtelnau therefore intreated Elizabeth to mitigate a little the rigours of
                    Mary’s confinement; which being refused, the latter had thoughts oſ reſigning
                    her claims to the crown both of England and Scotland into the hands of her ſon,
                    and even of adviſing him to uſe every effort in his power to eſtabliſh his claim
                    to the Engliſh crown as preferable to that of Elizabeth. But being apprehenſive
                    of danger from this violent method, ſhe again contented herſelf with ſending to
                    the court of England ineffectual memorials and remonſtrances. Elizabeth, inſtead
                    of taking compaſſion on her miſerable ſituation, aſſiduouſly encouraged every
                    kind of diſorder in the kingdom, on purpoſe to have the queen more and more in
                    her power. Thus the Scottiſh malconents finding themſelves always ſupported, a
                    conſpiracy was at laſt entered into, the deſign of which was to hold James in
                    captivity, and to overthrow the authority of Arran and Lenox, who were now the
                    principal perſons in the kingdom. The chief actors in this conſpiracy were the
                    earls of Gowrie, Marre, and Glencairn, the lords Lindſay and Boyd, with the
                    maſters of Glammis and Oliphant. By reaſon of the youth and imbecillity of the
                    king, they eaſily accompliſhed their purpoſe; and having got him in their power,
                    they promiſed him his liberty, provided he would command Lenox to depart the
                    kingdom. This was accordingly done; but the king found himſelf as much a
                    priſoner as before. The more effectually to detain him in cuſtody, the rebels
                    conſtrained him to iſſue a proclamation, wherein he declared himſelf to be at
                    perfect liberty. Lenox was preparing to advance to the king’s relief with a
                    conſiderable body of forces, when he was diſconcerted by the king’s peremptory
                    command to leave Scotland; upon which he retired to Dumbarton, in order to wait
                    for a more favourable opportunity. The earl of Arran, being more forward, was
                    committed to cloſe cuſtody for ſome time, but afterwards confined only in his
                    houſe of Kinneil. The rebels took upon them the title of “lords for the
                    reformation of the ſtate.”</p>
                <p>The clergy, who had all this time been exceedingly averſe to Epiſcopacy, now gave
                    open countenance to the lords of the reformation. On the 13th of October 1582,
                    they made a ſolemn act, by which the <hi rend="italic">raid oſ Ruthven,</hi> as
                    the capture of the king was called, was deemed a ſervice moſt acceptable to all
                    who feared God, reſpected the true religion, and were anxious for the
                    preſervation of the king and ſtate; and every miniſter was commanded to declaim
                    from his pulpit upon the expediency of this meaſure, and to exhort the people to
                    concur with the lords in proſecuting the full deliverance of the church, and the
                    perfect reformation of the commonwealth. Not ſatisfied with this approbation of
                    the clergy, the conſpirators got their proceedings approved by the ſtates of
                    Scotland, as “a good, a thankful, and a neceſſary ſervice to the king.” At the
                    ſame time it was enacted, that no ſuit civil or criminal of any kind ſhould ever
                    be inſtituted againſt the perſons concerned in it. Soon after this, Lenox took
                    his leave of Scotland, and ſailed for France, where he died.</p>
                <p>The unfortunate Mary was driven to deſpair when ſhe heard that her ſon was taken
                    priſoner by rebels who had been inſtigated by Elizabeth. In this diſtreſs, ſhe
                    addreſſed a moſt ſpirited letter to Elizabeth, in which ſhe at once aſſerted her
                    own innocence, and ſet forth the conduct of Elizabeth herſelf in ſuch language
                    as muſt have put the moſt impudent of her adverſaries to<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0093.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0087"/> the bluſh.
                    Elizabeth could not reply, and therefore had recourſe to her uſual arts of
                    treacherous negociation. New terms were propoſed to Mary, who would gladly have
                    ſubmitted almoſt to any thing, provided ſhe could procure her freedom. It was
                    propoſed, as had often been done before, to aſſociate the queen oſ Scots with
                    her ſon in the government; but as this was to be referred to the king, who was
                    in the hands of Elizabeth’s friends, and to the parliament, who were under the
                    power of the ſame faction, it is eaſy to ſee that no ſuch aſſociation ever could
                    take place, or indeed was ever intended.</p>
                <p>After the death of Lenox, the conſpirators apprehended no further danger, little
                    ſuppoſing that a prince ſo young and unexperienced could deliver himſelf from
                    captivity. This, however, in the year 1583, he effected in the following manner.
                    A convention of the eſtates had been ſummoned to meet at St Andrew’s. James,
                    whom the earl of Arran, notwithſtanding his confinement at Kinneil, had found
                    means to inſtruct and adviſe, pretended a deſire of viſiting his grand-uncle the
                    earl of March, who reſided at St Andrew’s, and was for that purpoſe permitted to
                    repair thither a few days before the convention. The better to deceive the earls
                    of Gowrie, Angus, and Marre, who attended him, he took up his lodgings in an old
                    inn, which was quite open and defenceleſs. But having expreſſed a deſire to ſee
                    the caſtle of St Andrew’s, he was admitted into it; and colonel Stuart, who
                    commanded the caſtle, after admitting a few of his retinue, ordered the gates to
                    be ſhut. The earls of Argyle, Mariſchal, Montroſe, and Rothes, who were in
                    concert with the king, haſtened to make him an offer of their ſwords. The
                    oppoſite faction, being unprepared for hoſtilities, were filled with
                    conſternation. Of all the conſpirators, the earl of Gowrie alone was admitted
                    into the king’s preſence, by the favour of colonel Stuart, and received his
                    pardon. The earls of March, Argyle, Gowrie, Mariſchal, and Rothes, were
                    appointed to be a council lor aſſiſting the king in the management of his
                    affairs; and ſoon after this James ſet out for Edinburgh. The king no ſooner
                    found himſelf at liberty, than, by the advice of his privy council, he iſſued a
                    proclamation of mercy to the conſpirators; but they, flattering themſelves with
                    the hopes <hi rend="italic">of</hi> ſupport from Elizabeth, obſtinately refuſed
                    to accept of his pardon. In conſequence of this, they were denounced rebels.
                    Elizabeth failed not to give them underhand all the encouragement ſhe could, and
                    the clergy uttered the moſt ſeditious diſcourſes againſt the king and
                    government; and while they railed againſt Popery, they themſelves maintained
                    openly the very characteriſtic and dinſtinguiſhing mark of Popery, namely, that
                    the clerical was entirely independent of the civil power.</p>
                <p>At laſt the rebels broke forth into open hoſtilſties; but by the vigilance of
                    Arran, the earl of Gowrie, who had again begun his treaſonable practices, was
                    committed to cuſtody; while the reſt, unable to oppoſe the Ring, who appeared
                    againſt them with a formidable army, were obliged to fly into England, where
                    Elizabeth, with her uſual treachery, protected them.</p>
                <p>The earl of Gowrie ſuffered as a traitor; but the ſeverity exerciſed againſt him
                    did not intimidate the clergy. They ſtill continued their rebellious practices,
                    until the king being informed that they were engaged in a correſpondence with
                    ſome of the fugitive lords, citations were given to their leaders to appear
                    before the privy-council. The clergymen, not daring to appear, fled to England;
                    and on the 20th of May 1584, the king ſummoned a convention of the eſtates, on
                    purpoſe to humble the pride of the church in an effectual manner. In this
                    aſſembly the raid of Ruthven was declared to be rebellion, according to a
                    declaration which had formerly been made by the king. And, as it had grown into
                    a cuſtom with the promoters of ſedition and the enemies of order, to decline the
                    judgment of the king and the council, when called before them to anſwer for
                    rebellious or contumelious ſpeeches, uttered from the pulpit or in public
                    places, an ordination was made, aſſerting that they had complete powers to judge
                    concerning perſons of every degree and function; and declaring, that every act
                    of oppoſition to their juriſdiction ſhould be accounted to be treaſon. It was
                    enacted, that the authority of the parliament, as conſtituted by the free votes
                    of the three eſtates, was full and ſupreme; and that every attempt to diminiſh,
                    alter, or infringe, its power, dignity, and juriſdiction, ſhould be held and
                    puniſhed as treaſon. All juriſdictions and judgments, all aſſemblies and
                    conventions, not approved of by the king and the three eſtates, were condemned
                    as unlawful, and prohibited. It was ordained, that the king might appoint
                    commiſſioners, with powers to examine into the delinquencies of clergymen, and,
                    if proper, to deprive them of their benefices. It was commanded, that clergymen
                    ſhould not for the future be admitted to the dignity of lords of the ſeſſion, or
                    to the adminiſtration of any judicature civil or criminal. An ordination was
                    made, which ſubjected to capital puniſhment all perſons who ſhould inquire into
                    the affairs of ſtate with a malicious curioſity, or who ſhould utter falſe and
                    ſlanderous ſpeeches in fermons, declamations, or familiar diſcourſe, to the
                    reproach and contempt of the king, his parents, and progenitors. It was ordered
                    that a guard, conſiſting of 40 gentlemen, with a yearly allowance to each of
                    2001. ſhould continually attend upon the king. This parliament, which was full
                    of zeal for the crown, did not overlook the hiſtory of Buchanan, which about
                    this time was exciting a very general attention. It commanded, that all perſons
                    who were poſſeſſed of copies of his chronicle, and of his treatiſe on the
                    Scottiſh government, ſhould ſurrender them within 40 days, under the penalty of
                    200 l. in order that they might be purged of the offenſive and extraordinary
                    matters they contained. This ſtroke of tyranny was furious and ineffectual.
                    Foreign nations, as well as his own countrymen, were filled with the higheſt
                    admiration of the genius of Buchanan. It was not permitted that his writings
                    ſhould ſuffer mutilation; they were multiplied in every quarter; and the
                    ſeverity exerciſed againſt them only ſerved the more to excite curioſity, and to
                    diffuſe his reputation.</p>
                <p>While the parliamentary acts, which ſtruck againſt the importance of the church,
                    were in agitation, the miniſters deputed Mr David Lindſay to ſolicit the king
                    that no ſtatutes ſhould paſs which affected the eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhment,
                    without the conſultation of the general aſſembly. But the earl of Arran having
                    intelligence of this commiſſion, defeated it, by committing Mr Lindſay to priſon
                    as a ſpy for the diſcontented nobles. Upon the publication, however, of theſe
                        acts<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0094.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0088"/> by
                    the heralds, Mr Robert Pont miniſter of St Cuthbert’s, and one of the ſenators
                    of the court of ſeſſion, with Mr Walter Balcanqual, proteſted formally in the
                    name of the church, that it diſſented from them, and that they were conſequently
                    invalid. Having made this proteſtation, they inſtantly fled, and were proclaimed
                    traitors. By letters and pamphlets, which were artfully ſpread among the people,
                    their paſſions were rouzed againſt the king and his council. The miniſters of
                    Edinburgh took the reſolution to forſake their flocks, and to retire to England.
                    And in an apology circulated by their management, they anxiouſly endeavoured to
                    awaken commiſeration and pity. They magnified the dangers which threatened them;
                    and they held out, in vindication of their conduct, the example of the prophets,
                    the apoſtles, the martyrs, and of Chriſt himſtlf, who all concurred, they ſaid,
                    in oppoſing the ordinations of men, when contradictory to the will of heaven,
                    and in declining the rage of the enemies of God, The king appointed his own
                    chaplains and the archbiſhop of St Andrew’s to perform the miniſterial functions
                    in his capital. The clergy over Scotland were commanded to ſubscribe a
                    declaration, which imported the ſupremacy of the king over the church, and their
                    ſubmiſſion to the authority of the biſhops. Tire national ferments ſtill
                    increaſed in violence. Many miniſters refuſed to ſubſcribe this declaration, and
                    were deprived of their livings. It was contended, that to make the king ſupreme
                    over the church was no better than to ſet up a new pope, and to commit treaſon
                    againſt Jeſus Chriſt. It was urged, that to overthrow aſſemblies and
                    preſhyteries, and to give dominion to biſhops, was not only to overſet the
                    eſtabliſhed polity of the church, but to deſtroy religion itſelf, For the
                    biſhops were the ſlaves of the court, were ſchiſmatical in their opinions, and
                    depraved in their lives. It was affirmed, that hereſy, atheiſm, and popery,
                    would ſtrike a deep root, and grow into ſtrength,, And the people were taught to
                    believe, that the biſhops would corrupt the nation into a reſemblance with
                    themſelves; and that there everywhere prevailed diſſimulation and blaſphemy,
                    perſecution and obſcenity, the profanation of the ſcriptures, and the breach of
                    faith, covetouſneſs, perjury, and ſacrilege. It was reported abroad, that the
                    miniſters alone were entruſted with eccleſiaſtical functions, and with the ſword
                    of the word; and that it was moſt wicked and profane to imagine, that Jeſus
                    Chriſt had ever committed the keys of the kingdom of heaven to civil magiſtrates
                    and their ſervants or deputies.</p>
                <p>While the clergy were thus impotently venting their wrath, Elizabeth, alarmed
                    beyond meaſure at this hidden revolution, and terrified by a confeſſion extorted
                    by the rack from one Francis 'Throgmorton, concerning a combination of the
                    Catholic princes to invade England, began to treat with Mary in a more ſincere
                    manner than uſual; but having gained over to her ſide the earl of Arran, the
                    only man of activity in Scotland, ſhe reſolved to proceed to extremities with
                    the queen of Scots, The Roman Catholics, both at home and abroad, were inflamed
                    againſt her with a boundleſs and implacable rage. There prevailed many rumours
                    of plots and conſpiracies againſt her kingdom and her life. Books were
                    publiſhed, which detailed her cruelties and injuſtice to Mary in the moſt
                    indignant lan</p>
                <p>guage of reproach, and which recommended her assassination as a moſt meritorious
                    act, The earl of Arran had explained to her the practices of the queen of Scots
                    with her ſon, and had diſcovered the intrigues of the Catholic princes to gain
                    him to their views. While her ſenſibilities and fears were ſeverely excruciating
                    to her, circumſtances happened which confirmed them in their ſtrength, and
                    provoked her to give the fulleſt ſcope to the malignity of her paſſions.
                    Crichton, a Scottiſh Jeſuit, paſſing into his own country, was taken by
                    Netherland pirates; and ſorne papers which he had torn in pieces and thrown into
                    the ſea being recovered, were tranſmitted to England. Sir William Wade put them
                    together with dexterity; and they demonſtrated beyond a doubt, that the invaſion
                    of England was concerted by the Pope, the king of Spain, and the duke of Guiſe.
                    About this time, too, a remarkable letter was intercepted from Mary to Sir
                    Francis Englefield. She complained in it that ſhe could have no reliance upon
                    the integrity of Elizabeth, and that she expected no happy iſſue to any treaty
                    which might be opened for her reſtoration and liberty. She urged the advancement
                    of the "great plot;” she intimated, that the prince her ſon was favourable to
                    the “deſignment," and diſpoſed to be directed by her advice; ſhe intreated, that
                    every delicacy with regard to her own ſtate and condition ſhould be laid aſide
                    without ſcruple; and ſhe aſſured him, that ſhe would moſt willingly ſuffer
                    perils and dangers, and even death itſelf, to give relief to the oppreſſed
                    children of the church. Theſe diſcoveries, ſo exaſperating to the inquietudes
                    and ditresses of Elisabeth, were followed by a deep and general conſternation,
                    The terror of an invaſion ſpread itſelf with rapidity over England; and the
                    Proteſtants, while they trembled for the life of their champion, were ſtill more
                    alarmed with the dangers which threatened their religion.</p>
                <p>In this ſtate of perplexity and diſtraction, the counſellors of Elizabeth did not
                    forget that they had been her inſtruments in perſecuting the queen of Scots, and
                    of the ſeventies with which ſhe had treated the Roman Catholics. They were fully
                    ſenſible, that her greatneſs and ſafety were intimately connected with their
                    own; and they concurred in indulging her fears, jealouſies, and reſentment. It
                    was reſolved that Mary ſhould ρeriſh, An aſſociation was formed, to which
                    perſons <hi rend="italic">of</hi> every condition and degree were invited, The
                    profeſſed buſineſs of this aſſociation or ſoeiety was the preſervation of the
                    life of Elizabeth, which it was affirmed was in danger, from a conſpiracv to
                    advance ſorne pretended title to the crown; and its members vowed and proteſted,
                    by the majeſty of God, to employ their whole power, their bodies, lives, and
                    goods, in her ſervice; to withſtand, as well by force of arms as by other
                    methods of revenge, all perſons, of whatſoever nation or rank, who ſhould
                    attempt in any form to invade and injure her ſafety or her life, and never to
                    deſiſt from the forcible purſuit of them till they ſhould be completely
                    exterminated. They alſo vowed and proteſted, in the preſence of the eternal God,
                    to proſecute to deſtruction any pretended ſucceſſor by whom, or for whom, the
                    deteſtable deed of the aſſaſſination of Elizabeth ſhould be attempted or
                    committed, The earl of Leiceſter was in a particular manner the patron of this
                    aſſociation; and the whole influence of Elizabeth and her<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0095.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0089"/> miniſters was
                    exerted to multiply the ſubſcriptions to a bond or league which was to prepare
                    the way, and to be a foundation for accompliſhing the full deſtruction and ruin
                    of the Scottiſh queen.</p>
                <p>A combination ſo reſolute and ſo fierce, which pointed to the death of Mary,
                    which threatened her titles to the crown of England, and which might defeat the
                    ſucceſſion of her ſon, could not fail to excite in her boſom the bittereſt
                    anxieties and perturbation. Weary of her ſad and long captivity, broken down
                    with calamities, dreading afflictions ſtill more cruel, and willing to take away
                    ſrom Elizabeth every poſſible pretence of ſeverity, ſhe now framed a ſcheme of
                    accommodation, to which no decent or reaſonable objection could be made. By Naw,
                    her ſecretary, ſhe preſented it to Elizabeth and her privy-council. She
                    proteſted in it, that if her liberty ſhould be granted to her, ſhe would enter
                    into the cloſeſt amity with Elizabeth, and pay an obſervance to her above every
                    other prince of Chriſten- dom; that ſhe would forget all the injuries with which
                    ſhe had been loaded, acknowledge Elizabeth to be the rightful queen of England,
                    abſtain from any claim to her crown during her life, renounce the title and arms
                    of England, which ſhe had uſurped by the command of her huſband the king of
                    France, and reprobate the bull from Rome which had depoſed the Engliſh queen.
                    She likewiſe proteſted, that ſhe would enter into the aſſociation which had been
                    formed for the ſecurity of Elizabeth; and that ſhe would conclude a defenſive
                    league with her, provided that it ſhould not be prejudicial to the ancient
                    alliance between Scotland and France; and that nothing ſhould be done during the
                    life of the Engliſh queen, or after her death, which ſhould invalidate her
                    titles to the crown of England, or thoſe of her ſon. As a confirmation of theſe
                    articles, ſhe profeſſed that ſhe would conſent to ſtay in England for ſome time
                    as an hoſtage; and that if ſhe was permitted to retire from the dominions of
                    Elizabeth, ſhe would ſurrender proper and acceptable perſons as ſureties. She
                    alſo proteſted, that ſhe would make no alterations in Scotland; and that, upon
                    the repeal of what had been enacted there to her diſgrace, ſhe would bury in
                    oblivion all the injuries ſhe had received from her ſubjects: that ſhe would
                    recommend to the king her ſon thoſe counſellors who were moſt attached to
                    England, and that ſhe would employ herſelf to reconcile him to the fugitive
                    nobles: that ſhe would take no ſteps about his marriage without acquainting the
                    queen of England; and that, to give the greater firmneſs to the propoſed
                    accommodation, it was her deſire that he ſhould be called as a party to it: and,
                    in fine, ſhe affirmed, that ſhe would procure the king of France and the princes
                    of Lorraine to be guarantees for the performance of her engagements. Elizabeth,
                    who was ſkilful in hypocriſy, diſcovered the moſt deciſive ſymptoms of
                    ſatisfaction and joy when theſe overtures were communicated to her. She made no
                    advances, however, to conclude an accommodation with Mary; and her miniſters and
                    courtiers exclaimed againſt lenient and pacific meaſures. It was loudly
                    inſiſted, that the liberty of Mary would be the death of Elizabeth; that her
                    aſſociation with her ſon would be the ruin both of England and Scotland; and
                    that her elevation to power would extend the empire of Popery, and give a deadly
                    blow to the doctrines of the reformation.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, an act of attainder had paſſed againſt the fugitive nobles, and
                    their eſtates and honours were forfeited to the king; who, not ſatisſied with
                    this, ſent Patrick maſter of Gray to demand a ſurrender of their perſons from
                    the queen of England. As this ambaſſador had reſided ſome time in France, and
                    been intimate with the duke of Guiſe, he was recommended to Mary: but being a
                    man of no principles, he eaſily ſuffered himſelf to be corrupted by Elizabeth;
                    and while he pretended friendſhip to the unfortunate queen, he diſcovered all
                    that he knew of the intentions of her and her ſon. The moſt ſcandalous
                    falſehoods were forged againſt Mary; and the leſs ſhe was apparently able to
                    execute, the more ſhe was ſaid to deſign. That an unhappy woman, confined and
                    guarded with the utmoſt vigilance, who had not for many years ſufficient
                    intereſt to procure a decent treatment for herſelf, ſhould be able to carry on
                    ſuch cloſe and powerful negociations with different princes as were imputed to
                    her, is an abſurdity which it muſt for ever be impoſſible to reconcile. That ſhe
                    had an amour with her keeper the earl of Shrewſhury, as was now reported, might
                    be; though of this there is no proof. This, however, could ſcarce be treaſon
                    againſt Elizabeth<note anchored="true" n="11" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>(x) Amidſt the infamous calumnies which this princeſs was ſolicitous
                            to fix upon the queen of Scots, it muſt excite the higheſt indignation
                            to conſider her own contempt of chaſtity, and the unprincipled
                            licentiouſneſs of her private life. See Haynes’s Collect. of State

                    this, Mary was committed to the charge of Sir Amias Paulet and Sir Drue Drury,
                    zealous puritans, and who, it was hoped, would treat her with ſuch ſeverity as
                    might drive her to deſpair, and induce her to commit ſome raſh action. — The
                    earl of Leiceſter, ſaid to be Elizabeth’s paramour, even ventured to ſend
                    aſſaſſins, on purpoſe, by the murder of Mary, at once to deliver his miſtreſs
                    from her fears. But the new keepers of the caſtle, though religious bigots, were
                    men of ſtrict probity, and rejected with ſcorn ſuch an infamous tranſaction. In
                    1585, Mary began to feel all the rigours of a ſevere impriſonment. She had been
                    removed from Sheffield to the caſtle of Tutbury; and under her new keepers ſhe
                    experienced a treatment which was in the higheſt degree unjuſt, diſreſpectful,
                    and acrimonious. Two apartments or chambers only were allotted to her, and they
                    were ſmall and inconvenient, meanly furniſhed, and ſo full of apertures and
                    chinks, that they could not protect her againſt the inclemencies of the weather.
                    The liberty of going abroad for pleaſure or exerciſe was de-<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0096.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0090"/> med to her.
                    She was aſſailed by rheumatiſms and other maladies; and her phyſician would not
                    undertake to effect a cure, or even to procure her any eaſe, unleſs ſhe ſhould
                    be removed to a more commodious dwelling. Applications for this purpoſe were
                    frequently made, and uniformly rejected. Here, however, her own afflictions did
                    not extinguiſh in her mind her ſenſibility for the misfortunes of others; and
                    ſhe often indulged herſelf in the ſatisfaction of employing a ſervant to go
                    through the village of Tutbury in ſearch of objects of diſtreſs, to whom ſhe
                    might deal out her charity. But her inhuman keepers, envying her this pleaſure,
                    commanded her to abſtain from it. Imputing their rigour to a ſuſpicious
                    fidelity, ſhe deſired that her fervant might, on theſe occaſions, be accompanied
                    by one of the ſoldiers of their guard, or by the conſtable of the village. But
                    they would not alter their prohibition. They refuſed to her the exerciſe of the
                    Chriſtian duty of diſpenfing an alms; and they would not allow her the ſoft
                    conſolation of moiſtening her eye with ſorrows not her own. To inſult her the
                    more, the caſtle of Tutbury was converted into a common jail. A young man, whoſe
                    crime was the profeſſion of the Romiſh religion, was committed to a chamber
                    which was oppoſite to her window, in order that he might be perſecuted in her
                    fight with a peſtilent cruelty. Notwithſtanding his cries and reſiſtance, he was
                    dragged every morning to hear prayers, and to join in the Proteſtant worſhip;
                    and after enduring ſeveral weeks this extraordinary violence to his conſcience,
                    he was unmercifully ſtrangled without any form of law or juſtice. Mary
                    remonſtrated with warmth to Elizabeth againſt indignities ſo ſhocking and ſo
                    horrible; but inſtead of obtaining conſolation or relief, ſhe was involved more
                    deeply in wo, and expoſed to ſtill harder inventions of malice and of anger.</p>
                <p>In the midſt of her misfortunes, Mary had ſtill ſolaced herſelf with hope; and
                    from the exertions of her ſon ſhe naturally expected a ſuperlative advantage. He
                    had hitherto behaved with a becoming cordiality; and in the negociation which
                    ſhe had opened with him for her aſſociation in the government, he had been
                    ſtudious to pleaſe and flatter her. He had informed her by a particular
                    diſpatch, that he found the greateſt comfort in her maternal tenderneſs, and
                    that he would accompliſh her commands with humility and expedition; that he
                    would not fail to ratify her union and aſſociation with him in the government;
                    that it would be his moſt earneſt endeavour to reconcile their common ſubjects
                    to that meaſure; and that ſhe might expect from him, during his life, every
                    ſatisfaction and duty which a good mother could promiſe to herſelf from an
                    affectionate and obedient ſon. But theſe fair bloſſoms of kindneſs and love were
                    all blaſted by the treacherous arts of Elizabeth. By the maſter of Gray, who had
                    obtained an aſcendant over James, ſhe turned from Mary his affections. He
                    delayed to ratify her aſſociation in the government; and he even appeared to be
                    unwilling to preſs Elizabeth on the ſubject of her liberty. The maſter of Gray
                    had convinced him, that if any favour was ſhown to Mary by the queen of England,
                    it would terminate in his humiliation. He aſſured him, that if his mother were
                    again to mount the Scottiſh throne, her zeal for Popery would induce her to ſeek
                    a huſband in the houſe of Auſtria: that ſhe would diſſolve his aſſociation with
                    her in the government, on the pretence of his attachment to the reformed
                    doctrines; and that he would not only loſe the glory of his preſent power, but
                    endanger his proſpects of ſucceſſion. Mary expoſtulated with him by letter upon
                    the timidity and coldneſs of his behaviour; and he returned her an anſwer full
                    of diſreſpect, in which he intimated his reſolution to conſider her in no other
                    character than as queen-mother. Her amazement, indignation, and grief, were
                    infinite. She wrote to Caſtelnau the French ambaſſador to inform him of her
                    inquietudes and anguiſh. “My ſon (ſaid ſhe) is ungrateful; and I deſire that the
                    king your maſter ſhall conſider him no longer as a ſovereign. In your future
                    diſpatches, abſtain from giving him the title of king. I am his queen and his
                    ſovereign; and while I live, and continue at variance with him, he can at the
                    beſt be but an uſurper. From him I derive no luſtre; and without me he could
                    only have been lord Darnley or the earl of Lenox; for I raiſed his father from
                    being my ſubject to be my huſband. I aſk from him nothing that is his; what I
                    claim is my own; and if he perſiſts in his courſe of impiety and ingratitude, I
                    will beſtow upon him my malediction, and deprive him not only of all right to
                    Scotland, but of all the dignity and grandeur to which he may ſucceed through
                    me. My enemies ſhall not enjoy the advantages they expect from him. For to the
                    king of Spain I will convey, in the ampleſt form, my claims, titles, and
                    greatneſs.”</p>
                <p>Elizabeth having thus found means to ſow diſſenſion between the queen of Scots
                    and her ſon, did not fail to make the beſt uſe ſhe could of the quarrel for her
                    own advantage. The Pope, the duke of Guiſe, and the king of Spain, had concluded
                    an alliance, called the <hi rend="italic">holy league,</hi> for the extirpation
                    of the Proteſtant religion all over Europe. Elizabeth was thrown into the
                    greateſt conſternation on this account; and the idea of a counter aſſociation
                    among the Proteſtant princes of Europe immediately ſuggeſted itſelf. Sir Edward
                    Wotton was deputed to Scotland; and ſo completely gained upon the imbecility of
                    James, that he concluded a firm alliance with Elizabeth, without making any
                    ſtipulation in favour of his mother. Nay, ſo far was he the dupe of this
                    ambaſſador and his miſtreſs, that he allowed himſelf to be perſuaded to take
                    into his favour Mr Archibald Douglas, one of the murderers of Lord Darnley; and,
                    as if all this had not been ſuſſicient, he appointed this aſſaſſin to be his
                    ambaſſador for England.</p>
                <p>Mary, thus abandoned by all the world, in the hands of her moſt inveterate and
                    cruel enemy, fell a victim to her reſentment and treachery in the year 1587. A
                    plot of aſſaſſination had been formed in the ſpring of the year 1586 againſt the
                    Engliſh queen; partly with a view to reſcue the Scottiſh princeſs; but chiefly
                    from a motive to ſerve the intereſts of the Roman Catholic religion. This
                    conſpiracy, which originated with Roman Catholic prieſts and perſons of little
                    note, was ſoon imparted to Mr Babington, a perſon of great fortune, of many
                    accompliſhments, and who had before that time diſcovered himſelf to be a zealous
                    friend of queen Mary. That ſhe had correſponded with Babington there is no
                    doubt; but it was ſome years previous to the formation of the plot. A long
                    ſilence had taken place between them; and Morgan,<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0097.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0091"/> one of the
                    Engliſh fugitives in France, and awarm friend of Mary’s, in the month of May
                    1586, wrote a letter to her, repeatedly and in the moſt preſſing manner
                    recommending a revival of that correſpondence. In conſequence of which, in her
                    anſwer to Morgan, dated the 27th day of July, ſhe informed him, that ſhe had
                    made all apologies in her power to Babington, for not having written to him for
                    ſo long a ſpace; that he had generouſly offered himſelf and all his fortune in
                    her cauſe; and that, agreeably to Morgan’s advice, ſhe would do her belt to
                    retain him in her intereſts; but ſhe throws out no hint of her knowledge of the
                    intended aſſaſſination. On the very fame day ſhe wrote like- wiſe to Paget,
                    another of her moſt confidential friends; but not a word in it with reſpect to
                    Babington’s ſcheme of cutting off the Engliſh queen. To Morgan and to Paget ſhe
                    certainly would have communicated her mind, more, readily and more particularly
                    than to Babington, and have conſulted them about the plot, had ſhe been
                    acceſſory to it. Indeed it ſeems to have been part of the policy of Mary’s
                    friends to keep her a ſtranger to all clandeſtine and hazardous undertakings in
                    her favour. To be convinced of this, we have only to recollect, that Morgan, in
                    a letter of the fourth of July, expreſsly, and in the ſtrongeſt terms,
                    recommended to have no intelligence at all with Ballard<note anchored="true" n="12" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Murdin, 527.</p></note> *,
                    who was one of the original contrivers of the plot, and who was the very perſon
                    who communicated it to Babington. The queen, in conſequence of this, ſhut the
                    door againſt all correſpondence, if it ſhould be offered, with that perſon<note anchored="true" n="13" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>† Ibid.
                            534.</p></note> †. At the ſame time, Morgan aſſigned no particular
                    reaſons for that advice; ſo cautious was he about giving the queen any
                    information upon the ſubject: What he ſaid was generally and ſtudiouſly obſcure:
                    “Ballard (ſaid he, only) is intent on ſome matters of conſequence, the iſſue of
                    which is uncertain.” He even went farther, and charged Ballard himſelf to
                    abſtain in any wife from opening his views to the queen of Scots.</p>
                <p>The conſpiracy which goes under the name of <hi rend="italic">Babington</hi> was
                    completely detected by the court in the month of June: The names, proceedings,
                    and reſidences, of thoſe engaged in it were then known: The blow might be ſoon
                    ſtruck: The life of Elizabeth was in imminent hazard. The conſpirators, however,
                    were not apprehended; they were permitted to enjoy complete liberty; treated as
                    if there were not the leaſt ſuſpicion againſt them; and in this free and quiet
                    ſtate, were they ſuffered to continue till the beginning of Auguſt, for a period
                    it ſhould ſeem of near two months. What could be the reaſons for ſuch a conduct?
                    From what cauſes did the council of England ſuſpend the</p>
                <p>juſt vengeance of the laws, and leave their queen’s life ſtill in jeopardy? Was
                    it on purpoſe to procure more conſpirators, and involve others in the crime?</p>
                <p>Mary queen of Scots continued ſtill detached from Babington and his aſſociates.
                    Their deſtruction was a ſmall matter comparcd with her’s. Could ſhe be decoyed
                    into the plot, things would put on a very new face: Babington’s conſpiracy,
                    which in reality occaſioned little dread, as it was early found out, and well
                    guarded againſt, would prove one of the moſt grateful incidents in queen
                    Elizabeth’s reign. Elizabeth's miniſters, too, knew how much they had rendered
                    themſelves juſtly obnoxious to the Scottiſh princeſs: Should ſhe come to mount
                    the throne of England, their downfall was inevitable; from which, it ſhould
                    ſeem, is to be explained, why they were even more zealous than their miſtreſs to
                    accompliſh her ruin.</p>
                <p>Of theſe, Sir Francis Walſingham ſecretary of ſtate appears to have taken upon
                    himſelf the chief management in concerting a plan of operations againſt the
                    queen of Scots; and as a model, he ſeems to have had in his eye that which was
                    purſued upon a former occaſion by the earl of Murray. His ſpies having early got
                    into the confidence of the lower ſort of the conſpirators, he now employed the
                    very agency of the latter for his purpoſes. Learning that a packet from France
                    was intended to be conveyed by them to queen Mary, and by the hands of one
                    Gilbert Gifford a prieft, whom he had ſecretly gained over from their
                    aſſociation, he wrote a letter to Sir Amias Paulet, who had now the cuſtody of
                    the Scottiſh queen, requeſting that one of his domeſtics might be permitted to
                    take a bribe for conveying that packet to the captive princeſs. This was on
                    purpoſe to communicate to her a letter forged in the name of Babington, in which
                    that conſpirator was made to impart to the Scottiſh queen his ſcheme of
                    aſſaſſination, and to claim rewards to the perpetrators of the deed. Paulet,
                    however, to his honour, refuſed to comply with the requeſt of Walſingham; upon
                    which Gifford corrupted a brewer in the neighbourhood, who put his letters to
                    Mary in a hole in the caſtle-wall. By the ſame conveyance it was thought that
                    Mary would anſwer the letters; but it appears that ſhe never ſaw them, and that
                    of courſe no return was made<note anchored="true" n="14" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>(Y) Dr Robertſon of Dalmeny, who, in his Hiſtory of Mary
                            queen of Scots, has thrown much light upon thoſe dark tranſactions of
                            Elizabeth’s nefarious miniſters, thinks it not improbable that an anſwer
                            to Babington’s letter was written by the Scottiſh queen’s ſecretaries.
                            Although they could not communicate that letter to herſelf, on account
                            of her known abhorrence of aſſaſſination, they perhaps wrote a diſpatch
                            in her name, approving of it; tempted by the proſpect of eſcaping from
                            impriſonment, and of their miſtreſs being ſeated on the throne of
                            England. This diſpatch being conveyed through the ſame chink of the
                            wall, was carried by Gifford to Walſingham; opened; deciphered, and
                            copied by him; and then ſent to Babington. Camden informs us, that
                            Walſingham artfully forged a poſtſcript in the ſame cipher to this
                            diſpatch; in which queen Mary was made to requeſt of Babington to inform
                            her particularly of the names of his accomplices, and of others who were
                            friends to the cauſe.</p></note> (Y). It was then contrived that
                    anſwers, in the name of the queen of Scots to Gifford, ſhould be found in the

                    formally to decipher them by the help of one Thomas Philips, a perſon ſkilled in
                    theſe matters; and after exact copies were taken of them, it is ſaid that they

                    appears, however, that only the letters directed to Babington were ſent to him;
                    and the anſwers which he made to the queen’s ſuppoſed letters were carried
                    directly to Walſingham. A foundation for criminating Mary being thus laid, the
                    conſpirators were quickly diſcovered, as being already known, and differed the
                    death of traitors. The unhappy princeſs, eagerly watched by Paulet, and
                    unacquainted with the late occurrences, received a viſit from Sir Thomas Gorges.
                    This envoy, as inſtructed by Elizabeth, ſurpriſed her when ſhe had mounted her
                    horſe to take the pleaſure of the chace. His ſalutation was abrupt and
                    unceremonious; and after informing her of the diſcovery and circumſtances of the
                    conſpiracy of Babington, he rudely charged her with a concern in it. Her
                    aſtoniſhment was great, and ſhe deſired to return to her chamber: but this
                    favour was refuſed to her; and after being carried from one houſe to another, in
                    an anxious and perplexing uncertainty, ſhe was committed to Fotheringay caſtle
                    in Northamptonſhire. Naw and Curl, her two ſecretaries, the former a Frenchman,
                    the latter a native of Scotland, were taken into cuſtody. Paulet breaking open
                    the doors of her private eloſet, poſſeſſed himſelf of her money, which amounted
                    not to more than 7000 crowns. Fier cabinets were carefully ſealed up; and being
                    ſent to London, were examined in the preſence of Elizabeth. They contained many
                    diſpatches from perſons beyond the ſea, copies of letters wſhich had been
                    dictated by her, and about 60 tables of ciphers and characters. There were alſo
                    diſcovered in them many diſpatches to her from Engliſh noblemen, which were full
                    of admiration and reſpect. Theſe Elizabeth concealed; but their authors
                    ſuſpecting that they were knowm, ſought to purchaſe her forgiveneſs by the moſt
                    abject proteſtations of an attachment to her perſon, and by the exerciſe of the
                    moſt inveterate enmity to the queen of Scots. Naw and Curl declared, that the
                    copies of her letters were in their handwriting. They had been dictated by her
                    in the French language to Naw, tranſlated into Engliſh by Curl, and then put
                    into cipher. They contained not, however, any matters with which ſhe could be
                    reproached or criminated. It was upon the foundation of the letters which
                    Gifford had communicated to Walſingham that her guilt was to be inferred; and
                    with copies of theſe, and with an atteſted account of the conſpiracy of
                    Babington and his aſſociates, Sir Edward Wotton was now diſpatched into France
                    to accuſe her to Henry III. and to explain to him the dangers to which Elizabeth
                    was expoſed from the machinations and practices of the Engliſh exiles.</p>
                <p>The privy counſellors of Elizabeth deliberated upon the moſt proper method of
                    proceeding againſt Mary. To ſome it appeared, that as ſhe was only acceſſory to
                    the plot, and not the deſigner of it, the moſt eligible ſeverity to be exerciſed
                    againſt her was a cloſer and more rigorous confinement; and they endeavoured to
                    fortify this opinion, by obſerving, that ſhe was ſickly, and could not live
                    long. By others who were haunted by the terrors of Popery, it was urged, that
                    ſhe ought to be put inſtantly to death by the formalities of the law. The earl
                    of Leiceſter recommended it as moſt prudent to diſpatch her ſecretly by poiſon.
                    But this counſel was rejected as mean, diſgraceful, and violent. The lawyers
                    were of opinion, that ſhe might be tried upon</p>
                <p>the ſtatute of Edward III.; by which it was enacted to be treaſon to imagine the
                    deſtruction of the ſovereign, to make war againſt his kingdom, or to adhere to
                    his enemies. Elizabeth, however, and her miniſters had provided a more plauſible
                    foundation for her trial. This was a parliamentary ſtatute approving the act of
                    aſſociation. As it had been paſſed while Mary was in England, it was argued,
                    that ſhe was bound by it in a local allegiance to Elizabeth. The next point of
                    debate was the deſignation under which it was moſt adviſable to arraign her. To
                    employ a foreign name and title as directly deſcriptive of her, was not judged
                    to be conſiſtent with the law of England. It was therefore reſolved to deſign
                    her “Mary, daughter and heir of James V. king of Scotland, and commonly called
                    queen of Scots, and dowager of France.”</p>
                <p>This reſolution being once taken, Elizabeth next appointed above 40 peers or
                    privy-counſellors, and five judges, bellowing upon them in a body, or upon the
                    greater part of them, abſolute power and authority to inquire into the matters
                    compaſſed and imagined againſt her by the Scottiſh princeſs, and to paſs
                    ſentence according to the ſpirit and tenor of the act which had been paſſed. Of
                    theſe commiſſioners a great majority proceeded to the caſtle of Fotheringay; and
                    the day after their arrival, they deputed to Mary, Sir Walter Mildmay, Sir Amias
                    Paulet, and Edward Barker a public notary, to deliver to her a letter from
                    Elizabeth. In this letter the Engliſh queen gratified her unhappy paſſions, and
                    after reproaching Mary with her crimes, informed her that commiſſioners were
                    appointed to take cognizance of them. The Scottiſh princeſs, though ailoniſhed
                    with the project of being brought to a public trial, was able to preſerve her
                    dignity, and addreſſed them with a compoſed manner and air. “It is a matter
                    (ſaid ſhe) altogether uncommon and ſtrange, that Elizabeth ſhould command me to
                    ſubmit to a trial, as if I were her ſubject. I am an independent ſovereign; and
                    will not tarniſh by any meanneſs my high birth, the princes my predeceſſors, and
                    my ſon. Misfortunes and miſery have not yet ſo involved me in dejection, as that
                    I am to faint and ſink under this new calamity and inſult. I deſire that you
                    will remember what I formerly proteſted to Bromley, who is now lord-chancellor,
                    and to the lord La War. To ſpeak to me of commiſſioners, is a vain mockery of my
                    rank. Kings alone can be my peers. The laws of England are unknown to me; and I
                    have no counſellors to whoſe wiſdom I can apply for inſtruction. My papers and
                    commentaries have been taken from me; and no perſon can have the perilous
                    courage to appear as my advocate. I have indeed recommended myſelf and my
                    condition to foreign princes; but I am clear of the guilt of having conſpired
                    the deſtruction of Ehzabeth, or of having incited any perſon whatſoever to
                    deſtroy her. It is only by my own words and writings that an imputation of this
                    kind can be ſupported; and I am conſcious beyond the poſſibility of a doubt,
                    that theſe evidences cannot be employed againſt me.” The day after ſhe had in.
                    this manner refuſed to allow the juriſdiction of the commiſſioners, Paulet and
                    Barker returned to her, and informed her that they had put her ſpeech into
                    writing, and deſired to know if ſhe would abide by it. She heard it read
                    diſtinctly, acknowledged it to be rightly taken, and avowed her readineſs to
                    perſiſt in the ſentiments ſhe had<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0099.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0093"/> delivered. But ſhe added, there was a
                    circumſtance to which ſhe had omitted to ſpeak. “Your queen (ſaid ſhe) affects
                    in her letter to obſerve, that I am ſubject to the laws of England, becauſe I
                    have lived under their protection. This ſentiment and mode of thinking are very
                    ſurpriſing to me. I came into England to crave her aſſiſtance and aid; and, ever
                    ſince, I have been confined to a priſon. The miſeries of captivity cannot be
                    called a protection, and the treatment I have ſuffered is a violation of all
                    law.”</p>
                <p>This afflicted but undaunted princeſs, after having thus ſcorned the competency
                    and repelled the pretexts of the commiſſioners, was induced at laſt, by
                    arguments under the inſidious maſk of candour and friendſhip, to depart from the
                    proper and dignified ground which ſhe had taken, and conſent to that mode of the
                    trial which had been propoſed. It was repreſented to her by Hatton the
                    vice-chamberlain, that by rejecting a trial, ſhe injured her own reputation and
                    intereſts, and deprived herſelf of the only opportunity of ſetting her innocence
                    in a clear light to the preſent and to future times. Impoſed upon by this
                    artifice, ſhe conſented to make her appearance before the judges; at the ſame
                    time, however, ſhe ſtill proteſted againſt the juriſdiction of the court, and
                    the validity of all their proceedings.</p>
                <p>After various formalities, the lord-chancellor opened the cafe; and was followed
                    by Serjeant Gawdry, who proceeded to explain the above ſtatute, and endeavoured
                    to demonſtrate that ſhe had offended againſt it. He then entered into a detail
                    of Babington’s conſpiracy; and concluded with affirming, “That Mary knew it, had
                    approved it, had promiſed her aſſiſtance, and had pointed out the means to
                    effect it.” Proofs of this charge were exhibited againſt her, and diſplayed with
                    great art. The letters were read which Sir Francis Walſingham had forged, in
                    concert with Gifford, amp;c. and her ſecretaries Naw and Curl. The three ſpies
                    had afforded all the neceſſary intelligence about the conſpiracy, upon which to
                    frame a correſpondence between Mary and Babington, and upon which diſpatches
                    might be fabricated in her name to her foreign friends; and the ciphers were
                    furniſhed by her two ſecretaries.<note anchored="false" n="15" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Stuart's History.</p></note> But beſide theſe
                    pretended letters, another ſpecies of evidence was held out againſt her.
                    Babington, proud of the diſpatch lent to him in her name by Walſingham and
                    Gifford, returned an anſwer to it; and a reply from her by the ſame agency was
                    tranſmitted to him. Deluded, and in toils, he communicated theſe marks of her
                    attention to Savage and Ballard, the moſt confidential of his aſſociates. His
                    confeſſion and theirs became thus of importance. Nor were her letters and the
                    confeſſions of theſe conſpirators deemed ſufficient vouchers of her guilt. Her
                    two ſecretaries, therefore, who had lately ſiorſaken her, were engaged to
                    ſubſcribe a declaration, that the diſpatches in her name were written by them at
                    her command, and according to her inſtructions. Theſe branches of evidence, put
                    together with ſkill, and heightened with all the impoſing colours of eloquence,
                    were preſſed upon Mary. Though ſhe had been long accuſtomed to the perfidious
                    inhumanity of her enemies, her amazement was infinite. She loſt not, however,
                    her coinage; and her defence was alike expreſſive of her penetration and
                    magnanimity.</p>
                <p>“The accuſation preferred to my prejudice is a moſt deteſtable calumny. I was not
                    engaged with Babington in his conſpiracy; and I am altogether-innocent of having
                    plotted the death of Elizabeth.<note anchored="false" n="16" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Stuart.</p></note> The copies of Babington’s
                    letters which have been produced, may indeed be taken from originals which are
                    genuine; but it is impoſſible to prove that I ever received them. Nor did he
                    receive from me the diſpatches addreſſed to him in my name. His confeſſion, and
                    thoſe of his aſſociates, which have been urged to eſtabliſh the authority of my
                    letters to him, are imperfect and vain. If theſe conſpirators could have
                    teſtified any circumſtances to my hurt, they would not ſo ſoon have been
                    deprived of their lives. Tortures, or the fear of the rack, extorted improper
                    confeſſions from them; and then they were executed. Their mouths were opened to
                    utter falſe criminations; and were immediately ſhut for ever, that the truth
                    might be buried in their graves. It was no difficult matter to obtain ciphers
                    which I had employed; and my adverſaries are known to be ſuperior to ſcruples. I
                    am informed, that Sir Francis Walſingham has been earneſt to recommend himſelf
                    to his ſovereign by practices both againſt my life and that of my ſon; and the
                    fabrication of papers, by which to effectuate my ruin, is a buſineſs not
                    unworthy of his ambition. An evidence, the moſt clear and inconteſtable, is
                    neceſſary to overthrow my integrity; but proofs, the moſt feeble and ſuſpicious,
                    are held out againſt me. Let one letter be exhibited, written in my hand, or
                    that bears my ſuperſcription, and I will inſtantly acknowledge that the charge
                    againſt me is ſufficiently ſupported. The declaration of my ſecretaries is the
                    effect of rewards or of terror. They are ſtrangers; and to overcome their virtue
                    was an ealy atchievement to a queen whoſe power is abſolute, whoſe riches are
                    immenſe, and whoſe miniſters are profound and daring in intrigues and treachery.
                    I have often had occaſion to iuſpect the integrity of Naw; and Curl, whoſe
                    capacity is more limited, was always moſt obſequious to him. They may have
                    written many letters in my name without my knowledge, or participation; and it
                    is not fit that I ſhould bear the blame of their inconſiderate boldneſs. They
                    may have put many things into diſpatches which are prejudicial to Elizabeth; and
                    they may even have ſubſcribed their declaration to my prejudice, under the
                    prepoſſeſſion that the guilt which would utterly overwhelm them might be
                    pardoned in me. I have never dictated any letter to them which can be made to
                    correſpond with their teſtimony. And what, let me aſk, would become of the
                    grandeur, the virtue, and the ſafety of princes, if they depended upon the
                    writings and declarations of ſecretaries? Nor let it be forgotten, that by
                    acting in hoſtility to the duty and allegiance which they ſolemnly ſwore to
                    obſerve to me, they have utterly incapacitated themſelves from obtaining any
                    credit. The violation of their oath of fidelity is an open perjury; and of ſuch
                    men the proteſtations are nothing. But, if they are yet in life, let them be
                    brought before me. The matters they declare are ſo important as to require that
                    they ſhould be examined in my preſence. It argues not the fairneſs of the
                    proceedings againſt me, that this formality is neglected. I am alſo without the
                    aſſiſtance of an advocate; and, that I might be defenceleſs and weak in the
                    greateſt degree, I have been robbed of my papers and com-<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0100.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0094"/> mentaries. As
                    to the copies of the diſpatches which are ſaid to have been written by my
                    direction to Mendoza, the lord Paget, Charles Paget, the archbiſhop of Glaſgow,
                    and Sir Francis Ingleſield, they are moſt unprofitable forgeries. For they tend
                    only to ſhow that I was employed in encouraging my friends to invade England.
                    Now, if I ſhould allow that theſe diſpatches were genuine, it could not be
                    inferred from them that I had conſpired the death of Elizabeth. I will even
                    conſeſs, that I have yielded to the ſtrong impulſes of nature; and that, like a
                    human creature, encompaſſed with dangers and inſulted with wrongs, I have
                    exerted myſelf to recover my greatneſs and my liberty. The efforts I have made
                    can excite no bluſhes in me; for the voice of mankind muſt applaud them.
                    Religion, in her ſterneſt moments of ſeverity, cannot look to them with
                    reproach; and to conſider them as crimes, is to deſpiſe the ſanctimonious
                    reverence of humanity, and to give way to the ſuſpicious wretchedneſs of
                    deſpotiſm. I have ſought by every art of conceſſion and friendſhip to engage my
                    ſiſter to put a period to my ſufferings. Invited by her ſmiles, I ventured into
                    her kingdom, in the pride and gaiety of my youth; and, under her anger and the
                    miſeries of captivity, I have grown into age. During a calamitous confinement of
                    20 years, my youth, my health, my happineſs, are for ever gone. To her
                    tenderneſs and generoſity I have been indebted as little as to her juſtice: and,
                    oppreſſed and agonizing with unmerited afflictions and hardſhips, I ſcrupled not
                    to beſeech the princes my allies to employ their armies to relieve me. Nor will
                    I deny, that I have endeavoured to promote the advantage and intereſt of the
                    perſecuted Catholics of England. My intreaties in their behalf have been even
                    offered with earneſtneſs to queen Elizabeth herſelf. But the attainment of my
                    kingdom, the recovery of my liberty, and the advancement of that religion which
                    I love, could not induce me to ſtain myſelf with the crimes that are objected to
                    me. I would diſdain to purchaſe a crown by the aſſaſſination of the meaneſt of
                    the human race. To accuſe me of ſcheming the death of the queen my ſiſter, is to
                    brand me with the infamy which I abhor moſt. It is my nature to employ the
                    devotions of Either, and not the ſword of Judith. Elizabeth herſelf will atteſt,
                    that I have often admoniſhed her not to draw upon her head the reſentment of my
                    friends by the enormity of her cruelties to me. My innocence cannot ſincerely be
                    doubted; and it is known to the Almighty God, that I could not poſſibly think to
                    forego his mercy, and to ruin my ſoul, in order to compaſs a tranſgreſſion ſo
                    horrible as that of her murder. But amidſt the inclement and unprincipled
                    pretences which my adverſaries are pleaſed to invent to overwhelm me with
                    calamities and anguiſh, I can trace and diſcover with eaſe the real cauſes of
                    their hoſtility and provocation. My crimes are, my birth, the injuries I have
                    been compelled to endure, and my religion. I am proud of the firſt; I can
                    forgive the ſecond; and the third is a ſource to me of ſuch comfort and hope,
                    that for its glory I will be contented that my blood ſhall flow upon the
                    ſcaffold.”</p>
                <p>To the defence of Mary, no returns were made beſide flout and unſupported
                    affirmations of the truth of the evidence produced to her prejudice. In the
                    courſe of the trial, however, there occurred ſome incidents which deſerve to be
                    related. My lord Burleigh, who</p>
                <p>was willing to diſcompoſe her, charged her with a fixed reſolution of conveying
                    her claims and titles to England to the king of Spain. But though, in a
                    diſcontented humour with her ſon, ſhe had threatened to diſinherit him, and had
                    even correſponded on the ſubject with her ſelect friends, it appears that this
                    project is to be conſidered as only a tranſient effect of reſentment and
                    paſſion. She indeed acknowledged, that the Spaniard profeſſed to have
                    pretenſions to the kingdom of England, and that a book in juſtification of them
                    had been communicated to her. She declared, however, that ſhe had incurred the
                    diſpleaſure of many by diſapproving of this book; and that no conveyance of her
                    titles to the Spaniard had been ever executed.</p>
                <p>The trial continued during the ſpace of two days; but ſhe commiſſioners avoided
                    to deliver their opinions. My lord Burleigh, in whoſe management Elizabeth
                    chiefly confided, and whom the Scottiſh queen diſcompoſed in no common degree by
                    her ability and vigour, being eager to conclude the buſineſs, demanded to know
                    if ſhe had any thing to add to what ſhe had urged in her defence. She informed
                    him, that ſhe would be infinitely pleaſed and gratified, if it ſhould be
                    permitted to her to be heard in her juſtification before a full meeting of the
                    parliament, or before the queen and her privy-council. This intimation was
                    unexpected; and the requeſt implied in it was rejected. The court, in
                    conſequence of previous inſtructions from Elizabeth, adjourned to a farther day,
                    and appointed that the place of its convention ſhould be the ſtar-chamber at
                    Weſtminſter. It accordingly aſſembled there; and Naw and Curl, who had not been
                    produced at Fotherſhgay- caſtle, were now called before the commiſſioners. An
                    oath to declare the truth was put to them; and they definitely affirmed and
                    proteſted that the declaration they had ſubſcribed was in every reſpect juſt and
                    faithful. Nothing farther remained but to pronounce ſentence againſt Mary. The
                    commiſſioners unanimouſly concurred in delivering it as their verdict or
                    judgment, that ſhe “was a party to the conſpiracy of Babington; and that ſhe had
                    compaſſed and imagined matters within the realm of England tending to the hurt,
                    death, and deſtruction, of the royal perſon of Elizabeth, in oppoſition to the
                    ſtatute framed for her protection.” Upon the ſame day in which this
                    extraordinary ſentence was given, the commiſſioners and the judges of England
                    iſſued a declaration, which imported, that it was not to derogate in any degree
                    from the titles and honour of the king of Scots.</p>
                <p>The ſentence againſt Mary was very ſoon afterwards ratified by the Engliſh
                    parliament. King James was ſtruck with horror at hearing of the execution of his
                    mother; but that ſpiritleſs prince could ſhow his reſentment no farther than by
                    unavailing embaſſies and re- monſtrances. France interpoſed in the ſame
                    ineffectual manner; and on the 6th of December 1586, Elizabeth cauſed the
                    ſentence of the commiſſioners againſt her to be proclaimed. After this ſhe was
                    made acquainted with her fate, and received the news with the greateſt
                    compoſure, and even apparent ſatisfaction. Her keepers now refuſed to treat her
                    with any reverence or reſpect. They entered her apartment with their heads
                    covered, and made no obeiſance to her. They took down her canopy of ſtate, and
                    deprived her of all the badges of royalty. By theſe intuiting mortifications<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0101.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0095"/> they meant to
                    inform her, that ſhe had ſunk from the dignity of a princeſs to the abject ſtate
                    of a criminal. She ſmiled, and ſaid, “In deſpite of your ſovereign and her
                    ſubſervient judges, I will live and die a queen. My royal character is
                    indelible; and I will ſurrender it with my ſpirit to the Almighty God, from whom
                    I received it, and to whom my honour and my innocence are fully known.” In this
                    melancholy ſituation Mary addreffed a magnanimous letter to Elizabeth, in which,
                    without making the leaſt ſolicitation for her life, ſhe only requeſted that her
                    body might be carried to France; that ſhe might be publicly executed; that her
                    ſervants might be permitted to depart out of England unmoleſted, and enjoy the
                    legacies which ſhe bequeathed them. But to this letter no anſwer was given.</p>
                <p>In the mean time James, who had neither addreſs nor courage to attempt any thing
                    in behalf of his mother, announced her ſituation to his bigotted ſubjects, and
                    ordered prayers to be ſaid for her in all the churches. The form of the petition
                    he preſcribed was framed with delicacy and caution, that the clergy might have
                    no objection to it. He enjoined them to pray, “that it might pleaſe God to
                    enlighten Mary with the light of his truth, and to protect her from the danger
                    which was hanging over her.” His own chaplains, and Mr David Lindſay miniſter of
                    Leith, obſerved his command. But all the other clergy refuſed to proſtitute
                    their pulpits by preferring any petitions to the Almighty for a Papiſt. James,
                    ſhocked with their ſpirit of intolerance and ſedition, appointed a new day for
                    prayers to be ſaid for Mary, and iſſued a ſtricter injunction to the clergy to
                    obey him; and that he might be free himſelf from any inſult, he commanded the
                    archbiſhop of St Andrew’s to preach before him. The eccleſiaſtics, diſguſted
                    with his injunction, perſuaded Mr John Cowper, a probationer in divinity, to
                    occupy the pulpit deſigned for the archbiſhop. When the king entered the church,
                    he teſtified his ſurpriſe, but told Cowper, that if he would obey his
                    injunction, he might proceed to officiate. Cowper replied, “that he would do as
                    the ſpirit of God would direct him.” The king commanded him to retire, and the
                    captain of his guard advanced to compel him to obedience. The enraged
                    probationer exclaimed, that this violence “would witneſs againſt the king in the
                    great day of the Lord;” and denounced a curſe againſt the ſpectators for not
                    exerting themſelves in his defence. The archbiſhop now aſcending the pulpit,
                    performed with propriety the function to which he had been called, and took the
                    opportunity to recommend moderation and charity to the audience. In the
                    afternoon Cowper was cited before the privy-council; and was accompanied there
                    by Mr Walter Balcanqual and Mr William Watſon, two miniſters remarkable for
                    their zeal. As a puniſhment for his audacious petulance, he was committed to the
                    caſtle of Blackneſs; and his attendants having diſtinguiſhed themſelves by an
                    impudent vindication of him, were prohibited from preaching during the pleaſure
                    of the king.</p>
                <p>Elizabeth, in the meanwhile, felt the torment and diſquiet of unhappy and
                    miſerable paſſions. At times ſhe courted the ſadneſs of ſolitude, and refuſed to
                    be conſoled or to ſpeak. In other ſeaſons her ſighs were frequent, and ſhe broke
                    out into loud and wild exclamations expreſſive of the ſtate of her mind. Her
                    ſubjects waited the determination of her will under a distracting agitation and
                    uncertainty. Her miniſters, who knew that it is the nature of fear to exclude
                    pity, were induſtrious in inventing terrifying intelligence, and in circulating
                    it through the kingdom. There were rumours that the Spaniſh fleet had arrived at
                    Milford-haven; that a formidable army of Scottiſh combatants was advancing to
                    the capital: that the duke of Guiſe had diſembarked many troops of veteran
                    ſoldiers in Suſſex; that Mary had eſcaped out of priſon, and was collecting the
                    Engliſh Catholics ; that the northern counties had thrown aſide their
                    allegiance; and that there was a new plot to kill Elizabeth, and to reduce
                    London to aſhes. An actual conſpiracy was even maliciouſly charged upon
                    L’Aubeſpine the French reſident; and he was forced to withdraw from England in
                    diſgrace. From the panic terrors which the miniſters of Elizabeth were ſo
                    ſtudious to excite, they ſcrupled not loudly and invariably to infer, that the
                    peace and tranquillity of the kingdom could alone be re-eſtabliſhed by the
                    ſpeedy execution of the Scottiſh queen.</p>
                <p>While the nation was thus artfully prepared for the deſtruction of Mary,
                    Elizabeth ordered ſecretary Davidſon to bring to her the warrant for her death.
                    Having peruſed it with deliberation, ſhe obſerved that it was extended in proper
                    terms, and gave it the authority of her ſubſcription. She was in a humour
                    ſomewhat gay, and demanded of him if he was not ſorry for what ſhe had done. He
                    replied, that it was afflicting to him to think of the ſtate of public affairs;
                    but that he greatly preferred her life to that of the Scottiſh princeſs. She
                    enjoined him to be ſecret, and deſired, that before he ſhould deliver the
                    warrant to the chancellor, he ſhould carry it to Walſingham. “I fear much (ſaid
                    ſhe, in a merry tone), that the grief of it will kill him.”</p>
                <p>This levity was momentary; and fears and anxieties ſucceeded it. Though ſhe
                    earneſtly deſired the death of Mary, ſhe was yet terrified to encounter its
                    infamy. She was ſolicitous to accompliſh this baſe tranſaction by ſome method
                    which would conceal her conſent to it. After intimating to Mr Davidſon an
                    anxious wiſh that its blame ſhould be removed from her, ſhe counſelled him to
                    join with Walſingham in addreſſing a letter to Sir Amias Paulet and Sir Drue
                    Drury, recommending it to them to manifeſt their love to her by ſhedding
                    privately the blood of her adverſary. The unlawfulneſs of this deed affected
                    Davidſon, and he objected to it. She repeated reſolutely her injunctions, and he
                    departed to execute them. A letter under his name and that of Walſingham was
                    diſpatched to Mary’s keepers, communicating to them her purpoſe. Corrupted by
                    her paſſions, and loſt to the ſenſibilities of virtue, Elizabeth had now reached
                    the laſt extremity of human wickedneſs. Though a ſovereign princeſs, and
                    entruſted with the cares of a great nation, ſhe bluſhed not to give it in charge
                    to her miniſters to enjoin a murder; and this murder was connected with every
                    circumſtance that could make it moſt frightful and horrid. The victim for whoſe
                    blood ſhe thirſted was a woman, a queen, a relation, who was ſplendid with
                    beauty, eminent in abilities, magnanimous under misfortunes, and ſmiling with
                    innocence. SirAmias Paulet and Sir Drue Drury, tho’ the ſlaves of religious
                    prejudices, felt an elevation of mind which reflected the greateſt diſgrace upon
                    the ſovereign. They conſidered themſelves as groſsly in-<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0102.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0096"/> ſulted by the
                    purpoſe propoſed to them; and in the return they made to Walſingham, they
                    aſſured him, that the queen might command their lives and their property, but
                    that they would never conſent to part with their honour, and to ſtain themſelves
                    and their poſterity with the guilt of an aſſaſſination. When Davidſon carried
                    their diſpatch to her, ſhe broke out into anger. Their ſcrupulous delicacy, ſhe
                    ſaid, was a dainty infringement of their oath of aſſociation; and they were
                    nice, preciſe, and perjured traitors, who could give great promiſes in words,
                    and atchieve nothing. She told him, that the buſineſs could be performed without
                    them; and recommended one Wingfield to his notice, who would not heſitate to
                    ſtrike the blow. The aſtoniſhed ſecretary exclaimed with warmth againſt a mode
                    of proceeding ſo dangerous and unwarrantable. He proteſted, that if ſhe ſhould
                    take upon herſelf the blame of this deed, it would pollute her with the blackeſt
                    diſhonour; and that, if ſhe ſhould diſavow it, ſhe would overthrow ſor ever the
                    reputation, the eſtates, and the children, of the perſons who ſhould aſſiſt in
                    it. She heard him with pain, and withdrew from him with precipitation.</p>
                <p>The warrant, after having been communicated to Walſingham, was carried to the
                    chancellor, who put the great ſeal to it. This formality was hardly concluded,
                    when a meſſage from Elizabeth prohibited Davidſon from waiting upon the
                    chancellor till he ſhould receive farther inſtructions. Within an hour after, he
                    received a ſecond meſſage to the ſame purpoſe. He haſtened to court; and
                    Elizabeth aſked eagerly, if he had ſeen the chancellor. He anſwered in the
                    affirmative; and ſhe exclaimed with bitterneſs againſt his haſte. He ſaid, that
                    he had acted exactly as ſhe had directed him. She continued to expreſs warmly
                    her diſpleaſure; but gave no command to ſtop the operation of the warrant. In a
                    ſtate of uneaſineſs and apprehenſion, he communicated her behaviour to the
                    chancellor and the privy-council. Theſe courtiers, however, who were well
                    acquainted with the arts of their miſtreſs, and who knew how to flatter her,
                    paid no attention to him. They perceived, or were ſecretly informed, that ſhe
                    deſired to have a pretence upon which to complain of the ſecretary, and to deny
                    that he had obeyed her inſtructions. They obſerved to him, that by ſubſcribing
                    the warrant, ſhe had performed whatever the law required of her ; and that it
                    was not proper to delay the execution any longer. While they were anxious to
                    pleaſe Elizabeth, they were conſcious of their own cruelty to Mary, and did not
                    imagine they could be in perfect ſecurſty while ſhe lived. They diſpatched the
                    warrant to the earls of Shrewſhury and Kent, with inſtructions to them to fulfil
                    its purpoſe.</p>
                <p>When the two earls and their retinue reached Fotheringay-caſtle, they found that
                    Mary was ſick, and repoſing upon her bed. They inſiſted, notwithſtanding, to be
                    introduced to her. Being informed by her ſervants that the meſſage they brought
                    was important and preſſing, ſhe prepared to receive them. They were conducted
                    into her preſence by Sir Amias Paulet and Sir Drue Drury; and with little
                    formality they told her, that Elizabeth had conſented to her death, and that ſhe
                    was to ſuffer the next morning at eight o’clock. Then Beale, one of the clerks
                    of the privy-council, who accompanied them, read over the warrant, which ſhe
                    heard with pious compoſure and unſhaken fortitude.</p>
                <p>They then affected to juſtify their miſtreſs by entering into details concerning
                    the conſpiracy of Babington. She put her hand upon the Scriptures, which lay
                    upon a table near her, and ſwore in the molt ſolemn manner, that ſhe never
                    deviſed, conſented to, or purſued the death of Elizabeth in any ſhape
                    whatſoever. The earl of Kent, unwiſely zealous for the Proteſtant religion,
                    excepted againſt her oath, as being made upon a Popiſh Bible. She replied to him
                    mildly, “It is for this very reaſon, my lord, to be relied upon with the greater
                    ſecurity; for I eſteem the Popiſh verſion of the Scriptures to be the moſt
                    authentic.” Indulging his puritanical fervour, he declaimed againſt popery,
                    counſelled her to renounce its errors, and recommended to her attention Dr
                    Fletcher dean of Peterborough. She heard him with ſome impatience; and
                    diſcovered no anxiety to be converted by this eccleſiaſtic, whom he repreſented
                    as a moſt learned divine. Riling into paſſion, he exclaimed, that “her life
                    would be the death of their religion, and that her death would be its life.”
                    After informing him that ſhe was unalterably fixed in her religious ſentiments,
                    ſhe deſired that her confeſſor might have the liberty to repair to her. The two
                    earls concurred in obſerving, that their conſciences did not allow them to grant
                    this requeſt. She intimated to them the favours for which ſhe had applied by her
                    letter to Elizabeth, and expreſſed a wiſh to know if her ſiſter had attended to
                    them. They anſwered, that theſe were points upon wſhich they had received no
                    inſtructions.</p>
                <p>She made inquiries concerning her ſecretaries Naw and Curl; and aſked, whether it
                    had ever been heard of, in the wickedeſt times of the moſt unprincipled nation,
                    that the ſervants of a ſovereign prineeſs had been ſuborned for the purpoſe of
                    deſtroying her. They looked to one another, and were ſilent. Bourgoin her
                    phyſician, who with her other domeſtics was preſent at this interview, feeing
                    the two earls ready to depart, beſought them with an emphatic earneſtneſs to
                    reflect upon the ſhort and inadequate portion of time that they had allotted to
                    his miſtreſs to prepare herſelf for death. He inſiſted, that a reſpect for her
                    high rank, and the multiplicity and importance of her concerns, required at
                    leaſt a period of ſome days. They pretended, however, not to underſtand the
                    propriety of his petition, and refuſed it.</p>
                <p>Upon the departure of the two earls, her domeſtics gave a full vent to their
                    afflictions; and while ſhe experienced a melancholy pleaſure in their tears,
                    lamentations, and kindneſs, ſhe endeavoured to conſole them. Their grief, ſhe
                    ſaid, was altogether unavailing, and could neither better her condition nor
                    their own. Her cauſe had every thing about it that was moſt honourable; and the
                    miſeries from which ſhe was to be relieved were the moſt hopeleſs and the moſt
                    afflicting. Inſtead of dejection and ſadneſs, ſhe therefore enjoined them to be
                    contented and happy. That ſhe might have the more leiſure to ſettle her affairs,
                    ſhe ſupped early, and, according to her uſual cuſtom, ſhe eat little. While at
                    table, ſhe remarked to Bourgoin her phyſician, that the force of truth was
                    inſurmountable; for that the earl of Kent, notwithſtanding the pretence of her
                    having conſpired againſt Elizabeth, had plainly informed her, that her death
                    would be the ſecurity of their religion. When ſupper was over, ſhe ordered all
                    her ſervants to appear before her, and treated them with<pb

                    which we have mentioned in her life. Having ſettled theſe attentions, ſhe
                    entered her bedchamber with her women; and, according to her uniform practice,
                    employed herſelf in religious duties, and in reading in the Lives of the
                        Saints<note anchored="false" n="17" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Stuart.</p></note>. At her accuſtomed time ſhe went to ſleep; and after
                    enjoying ſome hours of sound reſt, ſhe awaked. She then indulged in pious
                    meditation, and partook of the ſacrament by the means of a conſecrated hoſt,
                    which a melancholy preſentiment of her calamities had induced her to obtain from
                    Pius V.</p>
                <p>At the break of day ſhe arrayed herſelf in rich, but becoming apparel; and
                    calling together her ſervants, ſhe ordered her will to be read, and apologiſed
                    for the fmallneſs of her legacies from her inability to be more generous.
                    Following the arrangement ſhe had previouſly made, ſhe then dealt out to them
                    her goods, wardrobe, and jewels. To Bourgoin her phyſician ſhe committed the
                    care of her will, with a charge that he would deliver it to her principal
                    executor the duke of Guiſe. She alſo entruſted him with tokens of her affection
                    for the king of France, the queen-mother, and her relations of the houſe of
                    Lorraine. Bidding now an adieu to all worldly concerns, ſhe retired to her
                    oratory, where ſhe was ſeen ſometimes kneeling at the altar, and ſometimes
                    ſtanding motionleſs with her hands joined, and her eyes directed to the heavens.
                    In theſe tender and agitated moments, ſhe was dwelling upon the memory of her
                    ſufferings and her virtues, repoſing her weakneſſes in the boſom of her God, and
                    lifting and ſolacing her ſpirit in the contemplation of his perfections and his
                    mercy. While ſhe was thus engaged, Thomas Andrews, the high ſheriſſ of the
                    county, announced to her, that the hour for her execution was arrived. She came
                    forth dreſſed in a gown of black ſilk; her petticoat was bordered with
                    crimſon-velvet; a veil of lawn bowed out with wire, and edged with bone-lace,
                    was faſtened to her caul, and hung down to the ground: an Agnus Dei was
                    ſuſpended from her neck by a pomander chain; her beads were fixed to her girdle;
                    and ſhe bore in her hand a crucifix of ivory. Amidſt the ſcreams and
                    lamentations of her women ſhe deſcended the ſtairs; and in the porch ſhe was
                    received by the earls of Kent and Shrewſhury with their attendants.— Here, too,
                    ſhe met Sir Andrew Melvil the maſter of her houſehold, whom her keepers had
                    debarred from her preſence during many days. Throwing himſelf at her feet, and
                    weeping aloud, he deplored his ſad deſtiny, and the ſorrowful tidings he was to
                    carry into Scotland.</p>
                <p>After ſhe had ſpoken to Melvil, ſhe beſought the two earls that her ſervants
                    might be treated with civility, that they might enjoy the preſents ſhe had
                    bellowed upon them, and that they might receive a ſafe conduct to depart out of
                    the dominions of Elizabeth. Theſe flight favours were readily granted to her.
                    She then begged that they might be permitted to attend her to the ſcaffold, in
                    order that they might be witneſſes of her behaviour at her death. To this
                    requeſt the earl of Kent diſcovered a ſtrong reluctance. He ſaid that they would
                    behave with an intemperate paſſion; and that they would practice ſuperſtitious
                    formalities, and dip their handkerchiefs in her blood. She replied, that ſhe was
                    ſure that none of their actions would be blameable; and that it was but decent
                    that ſome of her women ſhould be about her.<note anchored="false" n="18" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Stuart.</p></note> The earl ſtill
                    heſitating, ſhe was affected with the inſolent arid ſtupid indignity of his
                    malice, and exclaimed, “I am couſin to your miſtreſs, and deſcended from Henry
                    VII. I am a dowager of France, and the anointed queen of Scotland.” The earl of
                    Shrewſhury interpoſing, it was agreed that ſhe ſhould ſelect two of her women
                    who might aſſiſt her in her laſt moments, and a few of her men-ſervants, who
                    might behold her demeanour, and report it.</p>
                <p>She entered the hall where ſhe was to ſuffer, and advanced with an air of grace
                    and majeſty to the ſcaffold, which was built at its fartheſt extremity. The
                    ſpectators were numerous. Her magnanimous carriage, her beauty, of which the
                    luſtre was yet dazzling, and her matchleſs misfortunes, affected them. They gave
                    way to contending emotions of awe, admiration, and pity. She aſcended the
                    ſcaffold with a firm ſtep and a ſerene aſpect, and turned her eye to the block,
                    the axe, and the executioners. The ſpectators were diſſolved in tears. A chair
                    was placed for her, in which ſhe ſeated herſelf. Silence was commanded; and
                    Beale read aloud the warrant for her death. She heard it attentively, yet with a
                    manner from which it might be gathered that her thoughts were employed upon a
                    ſubject more important. Dr Fletcher dean of Peterborough taking his ſtation
                    oppoſite to her without the rails of the ſcaffold, began a diſcourſe upon her
                    life, paſt, preſent, and to come. He affected to enumerate her treſpaſſes
                    againſt Elizabeth, and to deſcribe the love and tenderness which that princeſs
                    had flown to her. He counſelled her to repent of her crimes; and while he
                    inveighed againſt her attachment to Popery, he threatened her with ever- laſting
                    fire if ſhe ſhould delay to renounce its errors. His behaviour was indecent and
                    coarſe in the greateſt degree; and while he meant to inſult her, he inſulted
                    ſtill more the religion which he profeſſcd, and the ſovereign whom he flattered.
                    Twice ſhe interrupted hint with great gentleneſs. But he pertinaciouſly
                    continued his exhortations. Raising her voice, ſhe commanded him with a reſolute
                    tone to with-hold his indignities and menaces, and not to trouble her any more
                    about her faith. “I was born (ſaid ſhe) in the Roman Catholic religion; I have
                    experienced its comforts during my life, in the trying ſeaſons of ſickneſs,
                    calamity, and ſorrow; and I am reſolved to die in it.” The two earls, aſhamed of
                    the ſavage obſtinacy of his deportment, admoniſhed him to deſiſt from his
                    ſpeeches, and to content himſelf with praying for her converſion. He entered
                    upon a long prayer; and Mary falling upon her knees, and diſregarding him
                    altogether, employed herſelf in devotions from the office of the Virgin.</p>
                <p>After having performed all her devotions, her women aſſiſted her to diſrobe; and
                    the executioners offering their aid, ſhe repreſſed their forwardneſs by
                    obſerving, that ſhe was not accuſtomed to be attended by ſuch ſervants, nor to
                    be undrcſled before ſo large an aſſembly. Her upper garments being laid aſide,
                    ſhe drew upon her arms a pair of ſilk gloves. Her women and men ſervants burſt
                    out into loud lamentations. She put her finger to her mouth to admoniſh them to
                    be ſilent, and then bade them a final adieu with a ſmile that ſeemed to conſole,
                    but that plunged them into deeper wo. She kneeled reſolutely before the
                        block,<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0104.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0098"/> and
                    ſaid, "In thee, O Lord! do I truſt, let me never be confounded.” She covered her
                    eyes with a linen handkerchief in which the eucharrſt had been incloſed; and
                    ſtretching forth her body with great tranquillity, and fitting her neck for the
                    fatal ſtroke, ſhe called out, “Into thy hands, O God! I commit my ſpirit.” The
                    executioner, from deſign, from unſkilfulneſs, or from inquietude, ſtruck three
                    blows before he ſeparated her head from her body. He held it up mangled with
                    wounds, and ſtreaming with blood; and her hair being diſcompoſed, was diſcovered
                    to be already grey with afflictions and anxieties. The dean of Peterborough
                    alone cried out, “So let the enemies of Elizabeth periſh.” The earl of Kent
                    alone, in a low voice, anſwered, “Amen.” All the other ſpectators were melted
                    into the tendereſt ſympathy and ſorrow.</p>
                <p>Her women haſtened to protect her dead body from the curioſity of the ſpectators;
                    and ſolaced themſelves with the thoughts of mourning over it undiſturbed when
                    they ſhould retire, and of laying it out in its funeral garb. But the two earls
                    prohibited them from diſcharging theſe melancholy yet pleaſing offices to their
                    departed miſtreſs, and drove them from the hall with indignity. Bourgoin her
                    phyſician applied to them that he might be permitted to take out her heart for
                    the purpoſe or preſerving it, arid of carrying it with him to France. But they
                    refuſed his intreaty with diſdain and anger. Her remains were touched by the
                    rude hands of the executioners, who carried them into an adjoining apartment;
                    and who, tearing a cloth from an old billiard-table, covered that form, once ſo
                    beautiful. The block, the cuſhion, the ſcaffold, and the garments, which were
                    ſtained with her blood, were conſumed with fire. Her body, after being embalmed
                    and committed to a leaden coffin, was buried with royal ſplendour and pomp in
                    the cathedral of Peterborough. Elizabeth, who had treated her like a criminal
                    while she lived, ſeemed diſpoſed to acknowledge her for a queen when ſhe was
                    dead.</p>
                <p>On the death of his mother, the full government of the kingdom devolved on James
                    her ſon. Elizabeth, apprehenſive of his reſentment for her treatment of his
                    mother, wrote him a letter, in which ſhe diſclaimed all knowledge of the fact.
                    James had received intelligence of the murder before the arrival of this letter,
                    which was ſent by one Cary. The meſſenger was flopped at Berwick by an order
                    from the king, telling him, that, if Mary had been executed, he ſhould proceed
                    at his peril. James ſhut himſelf up in Dalkeith caſtle, in order to indulge
                    himſelf in grief; but the natural levity and imbecility of his mind prevented
                    him from acting in any degree as became him. Inſtead of reſolutely adhering to
                    his firſt determination of not allowing Cary to ſet foot in Scotland, he in a
                    few days pave his conſent that he ſhould be admitted to an audience of certain
                    members of his privy-council, who took a journey to the borders on purpoſe to
                    wait upon him. In this conference, Cary demanded that the league of amity
                    between the two kingdoms ſhould be inviolably obſerved. He ſaid that his
                    miſtreſs was grieved at the death of Mary, which had happene without her
                    conſent; and, in Elizabeth’s name, offered any ſatisfaction that James could
                    demand. The Scots commiſſioners treated Cary’s ſpeech and propoſal with becoming
                    diſdain. They obvſſerved, that they amounted to no more than know whether James
                    was diſpoſed to fell his mother’s blood; adding, that the Scottiſh nobility and
                    people were determined to revenge it, and to intereſt in their quarrel the other
                    princes of Europe. Upon this Cary delivered to them the letter from Elizabeth,
                    together with a declaration of his own concerning the murder of the queen; and
                    it does not appear that he proceeded farther.</p>
                <p>This reception of her ambalſador threw Elizabeth into the utmoſt conſternation.
                    She was apprehenſive that James would join his force to that of Spain, and
                    entirely overwhelm her; and had the reſentment or the ſpirit of the king been
                    equal to that of the nation, it is probable that the haughty Engliſh princeſs
                    would have been made ſeverely to repent her perfidy and cruelty. It doth not,
                    however, appear, that James had any ſerious intention of calling Elizabeth to an
                    account for the murder of his mother; for which, perhaps, his natural imbecility
                    maybe urged as an excuſe, though it is more probable that his own neceſſity for
                    money had ſwallowed up every other conſideration. By the league formerly
                    concluded with England, it had been agreed that Elizabeth ſhould pay an annual
                    penſion to the king of Scotland. James had neither economy to make his own
                    revenue anſwer his purpoſes, nor addreſs to get it increaſed. He was therefore
                    always in want; and as Elizabeth had plenty to ſpare, her friendſhip became a
                    valuable acquiſition. To this conſideration, joined to his view of aſcending the
                    Engliſh throne, muſt chiefly be aſcribed the little reſentment ſhown by him to
                    the atrocious conduct of Elizabeth.</p>
                <p>Elizabeth was not wanting in the arts of diſſimulation and treachery now more
                    than formerly. She proſecuted and fined ſecretary Davidſon and lord Burleigh for
                    the active part they had taken in Mary’s death. Their puniſhment was indeed much
                    leſs than they deſerved, but they certainly did not merit ſuch treatment at her
                    hands. Walſingham, though equally guilty, yet efcaped by pretending
                    indiſpoſition, or perhaps eſcaped becauſe the queen had now occaſion for his
                    ſervices. By her command he drew up a long letter addreſſed to lord Thirlſton,
                    king James’s prime miniſter; in which he ſhowed the neceſſity of putting Mary to
                    death, and the folly of attempting to revenge it. He boaſted of the ſuperior
                    force of England to that of Scotland; ſhewed James that he would for ever ruin
                    his pretenſions to the Engliſh crown, by involving the two nations in a war;
                    that he ought not to truſt to foreign alliances; that the Roman Catholic party
                    were ſo divided among themſelves, that he could receive little or no aſſiſtance
                    from them, even ſuppofing him ſo ill adviſed as to change his own religion ſor
                    Popery, and that they would not truſt his ſincerity. Laſtly, he attempted to
                    ſhow, that James had already diſcharged all the duty towards his mother and his
                    own reputation that could be expected from an affectionate ſon and a wife king;
                    that his interceding for her with a concern ſo becoming nature, had endeared him
                    to the kingdom of England; but that it. would be madneſs to puſh his reſentment
                    farther.</p>
                <p>This letter had all the effect that could be deſired. James gave an audience to
                    the Engliſh ambaſſador; and being aſſured that his blood was <hi rend="italic"
                        >not tainted</hi> by the execution of his mother for treaſon againſt
                    Elizabeth, but<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0105.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0099"/>
                    that he was ſtill capable of ſucceeding to the crown of England, he conſented to
                    make up matters, and to addreſs the murderer of bis mother by the title of
                    loving and affectionate ſiſter.</p>
                <p>The reign of James, till his acceſſion to the crown of England by Elizabeth’s
                    death in 1603, affords little matter of moment. His ſcandalous conceſſions to
                    Elizabeth, and his conſtant applications to her for money, filled up the meaſure
                    of Scottiſh meanneſs. Ever ſince the expulſion of Mary, the country had in fact
                    been reduced to the condition of an Engliſh province. The ſovereign had been
                    tried by the queen of England, and executed for treaſon; a crime, in the very
                    nature of the thing impoſſible, had not Scotland been in ſubjection to England;
                    and to complete all, the contemptible ſucceſſor of Mary thought himſelf well off
                    that he was not a traitor too, to his ſovereign the queen of England we muſt
                    ſuppoſe, for the caſe will admit of no other ſuppoſition.</p>
                <p>During the reign of James, the religious diſturbances which began at the
                    reformation, and that violent ſtruggle of the clergy for power which never
                    ceaſed till the revolution in 1688, went on with great violence. Continual
                    clamours were raiſed againſt Popery, at the fame time that the very fundamental
                    principles of Popery were held, nay urged in the moſt inſolent manner, as the
                    effects of immediate inſpiration. Theſe were the total independence of the
                    clergy on every earthly power, at the ſame time that all earthly powers were to
                    be ſubject to them. Their fantaſtic decrees were ſuppoſed to be binding in
                    heaven; and they took care that they ſhould be binding on earth, for whoever had
                    offended ſo far as to fall under a ſentence of excommunication was declared an
                    outlaw.</p>
                <p>It is eaſy to fee that this circumſtance muſt have contributed to diſturb the
                    public tranquillity in a great degree. But beſides this, the weakneſs of James’s
                    government was ſuch, that, under the name of peace, the whole kingdom was
                    involved in the miſeries of civil war; the feudal animoſities revived, and
                    daughter and murder prevailed all over the country. James, fitted only for
                    pedantry, diſputed, argued, modelled, and re-modelled, the conſtitution to no
                    purpoſe. The clergy continued their inſolence, and the laity their violences
                    upon one another; at the ſame time that the king, by his unhap</p>
                <p>py credulity in the operation of demons and witches, declared a moſt inhuman and
                    bloody war againſt the poor old women, many of whom were burnt for the imaginary
                    crime of converſing with the devil.</p>
                <p>In autumn 1600 happencd a remarkable conſpiracy againſt the liberty, if not the
                    life, of the king. The attainder and execution of the earl of Gowrie for the
                    part he acted in the raid of Ruthven and for ſubſequent practices of treaſon
                    have been already mentioned. His ſon, however, had been reſtored to his paternal
                    dignity and eſtates, and had in conſequence profeſſed gratitude and attachnrent
                    to the king. But the Preſhyterian clergy continued to expreſs their approbation
                    of the raid of Ruthven, and to declare on every occaſion that in their opinion
                    the earl of Gowrie had ſuffered by an unjuſt ſentence. One of the moſt eminent
                    and popular of that order of men was preceptor to the younger Gowrie and his
                    brothers, who, from their frequent conversations with him, muſt have been deeply
                    impreſſed with the belief that their father was murdered. The paſſion of revenge
                    took poſſeſſion of their breaſts; and having invited the king from Falkland to
                    the earl of Gowrie’s houſe at Perth, under the pretence of ſhowing him a ſecret
                    treaſure of foreign gold, which he might lawfully appropriate to his own uſe, an
                    attempt was made to keep him a cloſe priſoner, with threats of putting him to
                    inſtant death if he ſhould make any attempt to regain his liberty.</p>
                <p>The reality of this conſpiracy has been queſtioned by many writers, for no other
                    reaſon, as it would appear, but becauſe they could not aſſign a rational motive
                    for Gowrie’s engaging in ſo hazardous an enterpriſe; and ſome have even
                    inſinuated that the conſpiracy was entered into by the king againſt Gowrie in
                    order to get poffeſſion of his large eſtates. It has been ſhown however by
                    Arnot, in his Criminal Trials, with a force of evidence which leaves no room for
                    doubt, that the conſpiracy was the earl’s, who ſeems to have intended that the
                    king ſhould be cut off by the hand of an affaſſin; and the ſame acute and
                    diſcriminating writer has made it appear highly probable, that he entertained
                    hopes, in the then diſtracted ſtate of the nation not ill founded, of being able
                    to mount the throne of his murdered ſovereign<note anchored="true" n="19"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>( z ) The family of Ruthven had long been
                            looked upon as the head of that party which was attached to England and
                            the reformation; and the accompliſhments of the latter Gowrie qualified
                            him to be the leader of an enterpriſing faction. The importance he
                            derived from ariſtocratic influence over his extenſive domains, and from
                            the attachment of a powerful party in church and ſtate, was embelliſhed
                            with the luſtre of a regal deſcent. Thus ambition, as well as revenge,
                            might ſtimulate him to his daring enterpriſe. Indeed, if his attempt was
                            to be directed againſt the life of the king, it could no longer be ſafe
                            for him to remain in the condition of a ſubject: and the indecent and
                            malicious imputation of baſtardy, with which the fanatics reproached
                            king James, might afford a plauſible pretext for ſecluding the royal
                            offspring. The family of Hamilton, next heir to the crown, had long loſt
                            its popularity, and the earl of Arran, its head, had loſt his judgment;
                            and, though there undoubtedfuly were ſeveral families interpoſed between
                            Gowrie and the crown in the ſtrict line of fucceſſion, none of them
                            probably poſſeſſed power and popularity to ſupport their right. But if
                            Gowrie and his brother were really endowed with thoſe perſonal
                            accompliſhments which have been ſo highly extolled, and which made their

                    Thomas Erſkine afterwards earl of Kellie, and Sir John Ramſey who was likewiſe
                    ennobled; and though Gowrie and his brother fell in the ſtruggle, they were
                    attainted by an act of parliament, which decerned their name, memory, and
                    dignity, to be extinguiſhed; their arms to be cancelled; their whole eſtates to

                    holding, any offices, honours, or poſſeſſions.</p>
                <p>The moſt memorable tranſaction of James’s reign, and that moſt to his honour, is
                    the civilizing of the weſtern iſlanders. For this purpoſe, he inſtituted a
                    company of gentlemen adventurers, to whom he gave large privileges for reforming
                    them. The method he propoſed was to tranſport numbers of them to his low
                    countries in Scotland, and to give their iſlands, which were very improveable,
                    in ſee to his lowland ſubjects who ſhould chooſe to reſide in the iſlands. The
                    experiment was to be made upon the Lewes, a long range of the Ebudae; from
                    whence the adventurers expelled Murdoch Macleod, the tyrant of the inhabitants.
                    Macleod, however, kept the ſea; and intercepting a ſhip which carried one of the
                    chief adventurers, he lent him priſoner to Orkney, alter putting the crew to the
                    ſword. Macleod was loon after betrayed by his own brother, and hanged at St
                    Andrew’s The hiſtory of this new undertaking is rather dark; and the ſettlers
                    themſelves ſeem to have been defective in the arts of civilization. The
                    arrangements they made were conſidered by the inhabitants as very oppreſſive;
                    and one Norman, of the Macleod family, attacked and ſubdued them ſo effectually,
                    that they not only conſented to yield the property ot the iſlands to him, but
                    engaged to obtain the king’s pardon for what he had done.</p>
                <p>In 1603 James was called to the throne of England by the death of Elizabeth, and
                    the ſame year took a final leave of Scotland<note anchored="true" n="20"

                            James was married to Anne princeſs of Denmark, ſor whom he made a voyage

                    give a general account of the country.</p>
                <p>The firſt and great diviſion of Scotland is into the Highlands and Lowlands. The
                    former engroſs more than one half of Scotland; extending from Dumbartonſhire to
                    the moſt northern part of the iſland, a ſpace of 200 miles in length, and in
                    breadth from 50 to 100. This tract, however, includes ſeveral extenſive
                    diſtricts of low, fruitful ground, inhabited by people who are in all reſpects
                    different from the mountaineers. Nothing can be more ſavage and tremendous to
                    the eye of a ſtranger, than the appearance of the Highlands, compoſed of blue
                    rocks and duſky mountains heaped upon one another even above the clouds, their
                    interſtices rendered impaſſable by bogs, their ſides embrowned with heath, and
                    their ſummits covered with ſnow, which lies all the year unthawed, pouring from
                    their jagged ſides a thouſand torrents and roaring cataracts</p>
                <p>that fall into gloomy vales or glens below, ſome of them ſo narrow, deep, and
                    diſmal, as to be altogether impenetrable by the rays of the ſun; yet even theſe
                    mountains are in ſome places ſloped into agreeable green hills fit for paſture,
                    and ſkirted or interſperſed with pleaſant ſtraths or valleys capable of
                    cultivation. It may be unneceſſary to obſerve, that the Lowlanders of Scotland
                    ſpeak an ancient dialect of the Engliſh language, interlarded with many terms
                    and idioms which they borrowed immediately from France, in a long courſe of
                    correſpondence with that kingdom: they likewiſe copy their ſouthern neighbours
                    in their houſes, equipage, habit, induſtry, and application to commerce. As to
                    the inhabitants of the mountains, ſee the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >High-landers.</hi> They are, all, however, comprehended under the name of
                        <hi rend="italic">Scots</hi> governed by the ſame laws, and tried by the
                    ſame judges; and, whatever may be their diſſenſions at home, they always, when
                    abroad, acknowledge and aſſiſt one another as friends and countrymen. Some
                    authors have divided Scotland into that part which lies to the ſouthward of the
                    Frith, and that which lies to the northward; but the true diviſion is, like that
                    of England, into ſhires, counties, ſtewart- ries or bailiwicks, of which there
                    are above 40 within the kingdom of Scotland.</p>
                <p>The lace of this country exhibits a very mountainous appearance, eſpecially to
                    the weſt and northward; but, at the ſame time, it diſplays many large and long
                    tracts of plain ground fit for all the purpoſes of agriculture. It is divided
                    from eaſt to weſt by a chain of huge mountains, known by the name of <hi
                        rend="italic">Grant's bain</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Grampian
                        hills.</hi> There is another chain called the <hi rend="italic">Pentland
                        hills,</hi> which run through Lothian, and join the mountains of Tweeddale;
                    a third, called <hi rend="italic">Lammer-muir,</hi> riſing near the eaſtern
                    coaſt, runs weſtward through the Merſe: but beſides these, there is a vaſt
                    number of detached hills and mountains, remarkable ſor their ſtupendous height
                    and ſteepneſs. There is no country in the world better ſupplied than Scotland
                    with rivers, lakes, rivulets, and fountains. Over and above the principal rivers
                    of Tweed, Forth, Clyde, Tay, and Spey, there is an infinity of ſmaller ſtreams
                    that contribute to the beauty, convenience, and advantage of the kingdom. Tweed
                    takes its riſe from the borders of Annandale; ſerves as a boundary between
                    Scotland and England; and, after a long ſerpentine courſe, diſcharges itſelf
                    into the ſea at Berwick. Forth riſes in Monteith near Callendar, paſſes by
                    Stirling, and after a courſe of 25 leagues, runs into the arm of the ſea called
                    the <hi rend="italic">Frith of Forth,</hi> which divides the coaſt of Lothian
                    from File. Clyde takes its riſe from Errick hill, in the ſhire of Lanerk;
                    traverſes the ſhire of Clydeſdale, to which it gives name; waſhes the city of
                    Glaſgow, widens in its paſſage to the caille of Dumbarton, and forms the frith
                    of Clyde adjoining to the Iriſh ſea. Tay, the largeſt river in Scotland, derives

                    from a lake of the ſame name in Badenoch; and, running a north-eaſterly courſe,
                    falls into the German ocean, at Speymouth. Some of the freſh-water lakes are
                    beautiful pieces of water, incredibly deep, and ſurpriſingly extended. There are
                    ſeveral large foreſts of fir in Scotland, and a great number of woods; which,
                    however, produce very little timber of any conſequence: but the country, in
                    general, is rather bare of trees; and in many places neither tree, ſhrub, nor
                    any kind of plantation, is to be seen. The case has been otherwise of old; for
                    huge trunks of trees are often dug from under ground in almost every part of the
                    kingdom. In the North of Scotland, the day at midsummer is lengthened out to 18
                    hours and 5 minutes; so that the shortest night does not exceed 5 hours and 55
                    minutes; the night and day, in winter, are in the same proportion. The air of
                    this kingdom is generally moist and temperate, except upon the tops of high
                    mountains covered with eternal snow, where it is cold, keen, and piercing. In
                    other parts it is tempered by warm vapours from the sea, which environs it on
                    three sides, and runs far up into the land by friths, inlets, and indentations.
                    This neighborhood of the sea, and the frequency of the hills and mountains,
                    produce a constant undulation in the air, and many hard gales, that purify the
                    climate, which is for the most part agreeable and healthy. Scotland affords a
                    great variaty of soil in different parts of the country, which, being hilly, is
                    in general well adapted to pasturage: not but that the Lowlands are as fertile,
                    and, when properly enclosed and manured, yield as good crops of wheat as any
                    grounds in the iſland of Great Britain. The water in Scotland is remarkably
                    pure, light, and agreeable to the ſtomach: but, over and above that which is
                    uſed for the ordinary purpoſes of life, here are many medicinal ſprings of great
                    note.</p>
                <p>Scotland abounds with quarries of ſree-ſtone eaſily worked, which enable the
                    people to build elegant houſes, both in town and country, at a ſmall expence,
                    eſpecially as they have plenty of lime-ſtone, and labour very cheap. The eaſt,
                    weſt, and northern parts of the country produce excellent coal; and where this
                    is wanting, the natives burn turf and peat for fuel. Cryſtals, variegated
                    pebbles, and precious ſtones, are found in many parts of Scotland; talc, flint,
                    and ſea ſhells, fuller’s earth, potter’s clay, and metals in great plenty. The
                    country produces iron and copper ore, a prodigious quantity of lead, mixed with
                    a large proportion of ſilver; and in ſome places little bits of ſolid gold are
                    gathered in brooks immediately after torrents.</p>
                <p>The Lowlands of Scotland, as has been obſerved when duly cultivated, yield rich
                    harveſts of wheat; and indeed it muſt be owned that many parts of this kingdom
                    rival the beſt ſpots of England in agriculture: but theſe improvements have not
                    yet advanced into the weſtern and northern extremities of the iſland, where we
                    ſee nothing but ſcanty harveſts of oats, rye, and barley. The Highlands are ſo
                    defective even in theſe, that it is neceſſary to import ſupphes of oatmeal from
                    Ireland and Liverpool. This ſcarcity, however, we muſt not impute to the
                    barrenness of the ſoil, ſo much as to the ſloth and poverty of the tenants,
                    oppreſſed by rapacious landlords, who refuſe to grant ſuch leaſes as would
                    encourage the huſbandman to improve his farm</p>
                <p>and make himſelf better acquainted with the ſcience of agriculture. This is
                    perfectly well underſtood in the Lothians, where we ſee ſubſtantial incloſures,
                    plantations, meadows for hay and paſture, wide extended fields of wheat, the
                    fruits of ſkill and induſtry, and meet with farmers who rent lands to the amount
                    of 400 l. or 500 l a-year. Of plants this country produces an immenſe variety,
                    growing wild, excluſive of thoſe that are railed by the hands of the huſbandman
                    and gardener. Their farm-grounds are well flocked with wheat, rye, barley, oats,
                    hemp, and flax: their gardens produce great plenty of kitchen-roots, ſalads, and
                    greens; among which laſt we reckon thc colewort, known by the name of <hi
                        rend="italic">Scotch kail:</hi> their orchards bear a variety of apples,
                    pears, cherries, plums, ſtrawberries, gooſeberries, raſpberries, and currants:
                    here alſo apricots, nectarines, peaches, and ſometimes grapes, are brought to
                    maturity. In a word, there is nothing, whether ſhrub, fruit, or flower, that
                    grows in any part of South Britain, which may not, with a little pains, be
                    brought to the ſame perfection in the middle of Scotland. Among the trees and
                    ſhrubs which are the national growth of this country, we may reckon the oak, the
                    fir, the birch, the poplar, the alder, willow, elder, hazle, mountain-aſh,
                    crab-tree, and juniper; which laſt abounds to ſuch a degree in ſome parts of the
                    Highlands, that in the ſpace of a few miles many tons of the berries might be
                    yearly gathered: beſides theſe, we find the hawthorn, the ſloe, the dog-role,
                    furze, broom, fern, and whole tracts of land and mountains covered with ſtrong
                    heath. This affords ſhelter for the myrtillis, the fruit of which, called <hi
                        rend="italic">bilberries,</hi> is here found in great abundance, as well as
                    the brambleberry, cranberry, and wild ſtrawberry. The aſh, the elm, the
                    ſycamore, lime and walnut-tree, are chiefly planted about the houſes of
                    gentlemen; but even the incloſures of quickſet appear naked for want of Inch
                    hedge-rows as adorn the country of England. Indeed, great part of this kingdom
                    lies naked and expoſed like a common; and other parts have no other incloſure
                    than a paltry wall huddled up of looſe ſtones, which yields a bleak and mean
                    proſpect, and ſerves no other purpoſe than that of keeping out the cattle. All
                    the ſea-coaſt is covered with alga marina, dulſe, and other marine plants.</p>
                <p>The Highlands are well ſtocked with red deer, and the ſmaller ſpecies called the
                        <hi rend="italic">roe-buck,</hi> as well as with hares, rabbits, foxes, wild
                    eats, and badgers; and they abound with all forts of game. The rivers and lakes
                    pour forth a profuſion of ſalmon, trout, jack, and eels; the ſea-coaſt ſwarms
                    with all the productions of the ocean. The hills and mountains are covered with
                    ſheep- and black cattle for exportation, as well as domeſtic uſe. Theſe are of
                    ſmall ſize, as are alſo the horſes bred in the Highlands; but the Lowlanders uſe
                    the large breed, which came originally from England.</p>
