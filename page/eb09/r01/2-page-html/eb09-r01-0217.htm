<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">tho necessary reporting staff. In other cases individual newspapers put themselves on the same footing as the&nbsp;London newspapers by engaging separate staffs of reporters.&nbsp;This is the arrangement now. Parliamentary reporting is&nbsp;much fuller in the leading provincial newspapers than it is&nbsp;in most of the London papers, though the reports for the&nbsp;former have in all cases to be telegraphed to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The mode in which parliamentary reporting is carried out deserves some description. It has been said that the&nbsp;manager of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Chronicle</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> early in the century&nbsp;laid the foundation of the present system when he divided&nbsp;the work of reporting debates among a staff of reporters.&nbsp;That is exactly what is done now. The “ gallery,״ as it is&nbsp;familiarly called, is arranged with boxes for note-takers&nbsp;overlooking the floor of the House, and with seats behind&nbsp;for other note-takers who are waiting to take their turn.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> has three of the front boxes—one for the chief&nbsp;of its staff of reporters, one for a summary writer, and one&nbsp;for the note-taker engaged in the full report. Most of the&nbsp;other London papers have each two boxes—one for a&nbsp;summary writer, the other for a reporter. Each of the&nbsp;press agencies has two boxes. Hansard has one. The&nbsp;rest are occupied by provincial newspapers or by combinations of those newspapers. The staff of reporters attached&nbsp;to each paper or combination of papers numbers from six&nbsp;to sixteen shorthand writers. If, for the purpose of&nbsp;dascribing the work of parliamentary reporting, a staff of&nbsp;eight be assumed, the process can be made clear. One&nbsp;other preliminary point should be kept in mind: an&nbsp;expert and intelligent reporter can transcribe from his&nbsp;notes as much matter as that contained in a column of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> in rather less than an hour and a half. The&nbsp;staff of eight men may have turns of a quarter of&nbsp;an hour or of half an hour, or of any other length of&nbsp;time that may be agreed upon. The House of Commons&nbsp;begins its ordinary sitting at a quarter to four. At that&nbsp;time reporter No. 1 takes his place in the box and notes&nbsp;all that passes in the House. At four, assuming quarter&nbsp;hour turns, No. 2 relieves him; at a quarter past four&nbsp;No. 3 relieves No. 2, and at half past four No. 4: relieves&nbsp;No. 3. It will thus be seen that the eight reporters will&nbsp;cover a period of two hours, and that each of them has an&nbsp;hour and three quarters in which to extend his notes. If he&nbsp;has had a quarter of an hour’s note-taking of an important&nbsp;speaker he will have about three-quarters of a column of&nbsp;matter to write, and this he can do easily and have some&nbsp;time for rest before he has to take another “ turn.” In&nbsp;the case of an important debate extending far into the&nbsp;night, or into the morning, the “ turns ״ are shortened.&nbsp;Instead of a quarter of an hour, each reporter takes ten&nbsp;minutes, or five, or even three. The reporters go from the&nbsp;box to a writing room and there transcribe their notes,&nbsp;their “ copy ” being gathered by messengers attached to&nbsp;their paper, and carried by them to the printers. In the&nbsp;case of the provincial newspapers, the “ copy ” has to be&nbsp;telegraphed over the “ special ” or other wires, before it&nbsp;can reach the hands of sub-editors or compositors. That,&nbsp;however, is no affair of the reporter’s. He has to produce&nbsp;his report with as much rapidity as he can. In the case&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> his efforts are seconded by what is in practice&nbsp;an annihilation of the space between the House of&nbsp;Commons and the office of the paper. The reporter&nbsp;reads out from his notes to an operator on a telephonic&nbsp;wire, who speaks what he hears through that wire to&nbsp;the office of the paper. When it is received there&nbsp;it is spoken off again to a compositor at a composing&nbsp;machine; and thus it is most commonly in type and&nbsp;ready for printing long before the reporter’s “copy”&nbsp;could have been received from the House of Parliament. The telephone is also used in a similar way by</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">some of the newspapers which have special wires. The latest parts of the report of a night’s sitting are spoken&nbsp;through the telephone to the point from which the special&nbsp;wire starts, and they are promptly telegraphed to the&nbsp;newspaper for which they are intended. Thus it often&nbsp;happens that the finishing passages of a report of a late&nbsp;sitting in the House of Commons are actually in type in&nbsp;a newspaper office 400 miles away, before the members&nbsp;who have taken part in the proceedings have got on their&nbsp;greatcoats for their walk home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Parliamentary reporting, important as it is, yet forms a small part of the reporting which is done by the newspapers. All the public expositions of our complicated&nbsp;and busy social and national system are reported with&nbsp;a fulness, and on the whole with an amount of accuracy,&nbsp;that are surprising. Every newspaper of importance in&nbsp;the provinces has a more or less numerous staff of&nbsp;reporters at its command. In so,me cases, papers have&nbsp;separate staffs in different parts of the country. It is the&nbsp;business of these gentlemen to report all that is worth&nbsp;reporting for their journal. In the case of a long and&nbsp;important speech or meeting they will take turns in the&nbsp;reporting of it in the same w<sup>r</sup>ay as turns are taken in the&nbsp;Houses of Parliament. But no newspaper is able to&nbsp;confine its reporting to events in its own neighbourhood.&nbsp;It must give to the public full accounts of speeches of&nbsp;prominent public men, no matter where they are delivered.&nbsp;Sometimes a reporter is sent far awuy to do this work.&nbsp;In such a case he usually joins for the occasion the staff&nbsp;of one of the newspapers of the neighbourhood; or he and&nbsp;other reporters from a distance make up a staff to do the&nbsp;work. Again the system of turns comes in. But, for the&nbsp;most part, speeches of statesmen in different parts of the&nbsp;country are reported for newspapers at a distance by one&nbsp;or other of the news agencies, which send down staffs of&nbsp;reporters for the work. In some cases, all these modes of&nbsp;working are seen together—there are representatives of&nbsp;individual newspapers from far and near, and there are&nbsp;the staffs of the news agencies. During Mr Gladstone’s&nbsp;Midlothian campaign he had seldom fewer than seventy&nbsp;reporters in his train.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">As a rule, reporters are shorthand writers. That became a necessity when the demand for reporting greatly increased, and when the very words of a speaker had to be&nbsp;given. But what is spoken of as verbatim reporting is in&nbsp;no sense the best. It is a necessity, but to a great extent&nbsp;is merely mechanical. The reporter has acquired dexterity&nbsp;in shorthand writing, and he can read his notes fluently.&nbsp;Far more is required for that better reporting which&nbsp;conveys to the public the full sense of what a speaker has&nbsp;said without giving all his superfluous words. This is an&nbsp;art which is not universally acquired by reporters. They&nbsp;have learned to depend so much upon their notes that they&nbsp;do not learn to exercise their brains. There is much reporting wdiich shortens speeches by wholesale excisions rather&nbsp;than by judicious and intelligent compression. It w<sup>r</sup>ould,&nbsp;lunvever, be unjust to pass over the many proofs of high&nbsp;intelligence which the reporting in our newspapers contains.&nbsp;The task of the reporter is often not easy. He has, to use&nbsp;a familiar adage, to make many silk purses out of sows’&nbsp;ears ; and he does it patiently and w<sup>r</sup>ell—so well that the&nbsp;author of the material operated upon is often inclined to&nbsp;take all the credit to himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">So far, the reporting which has been spoken of is that by which speeches and debates are produced in print for the public information. But there is another kind of reporting which ought not to&nbsp;bo passed over. What is commonly called “ descriptive reporting ”&nbsp;has in some cases nearly shouldered the reporting of speeches out&nbsp;of newspapers. Is there a royal progress, or a military display, or&nbsp;a pageant of any kind—the descriptive reporter is called into&nbsp;requisition. He has to describe as best he can all that happens.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
