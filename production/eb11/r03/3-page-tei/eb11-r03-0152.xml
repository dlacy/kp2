It was a walled Romano-British town (though of no great size), and the original bridge across the Medway probably dated from that period. The church of St Andrew was founded by King Æthelbert, who also ,made Rochester a bishop’s see. Rochester was a royal borough in the time, of William I., who raised a castle here, probably on Boley Hill. Richard I. granted the citizens quittance of <hi rend="italic">passagium</hi>  from crusaders in the town of Rochester. In 1227 Henry 111. granted them the city at a fee farm rent of £25; he also ,granted them a gild merchant, the right to be impleaded only within the city walls, and other liberties. These charters were confirmed by subsequent sovereigns down to Henry VI., who in 1446 incorporated the city by the title of the bailiff and citizens, and granted them the power of admiralty and many privileges. Edward IV. by his charter of 1461 altered the style of incorporation to the mayor and citizens. Charters were granted in successive reigns down to Charles I., whose charter of 1629 remained the governing charter until 1835. A fair on the 18th, 19th and 20th of May was granted to the citizens by Henry Vf., and another fair was formerly held in December by prescription. At the present time fairs are held on the 18th of May and the 26th, 27th and 28th of August. A <hi rend="sup">11</hi>  formarket ” was granted in the second charter of Henry Iff.; the market days were formerly Tuesday and Friday.
