a large, handſome, populous, and ſtrong town of Italy, in the territory of Genoa, with two caſtles, and a biſhop’s see. It contains ſeveral handſome churches and well-built ſtructures. It was taken by the king of Sardinia in 1746, at which time it had a capacious harbour; but the people of Genoa, being afraid that it would hurt their own trade, choaked it up. It is ſeated on the Mediterranean tea, in a well- cultivated country, abounding in ſilk and all kinds of good fruit. E. Long. 8. 14, N. Lat. 44. 21.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
