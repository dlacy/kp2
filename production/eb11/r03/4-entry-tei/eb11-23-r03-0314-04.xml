                <p><label>RICKETS</label>, a constitutional disease of childhood characterized
                    chiefly by a softened condition of the bones and by other evidences of perverted
                    nutrition. It was first described in 1649 by Arnold de Boot, a Frisian physician
                    practising in Ireland. Its nature and causation are discussed under <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Metabolic Diseases.</hi> The name “ rickets ” is from the
                    Old English <hi rend="italic">wrickken,</hi> to twist; the more technical
                    medical term, <hi rend="italic">rachitis,</hi> which comes from Greek ῥάχις
                    spine, was suggested by Francis Glisson in 1650, both from similarity of sound
                    and from the part of the body which is one of the first to be affected.</p>
               <p>Rickets can seldom be recognized until several months after birth, and it most
                    commonly attracts attention at about the end of the first year. The symptoms
                    which precede the outward manifestation of the disease are marked disorders of
                    the digestive and alimentary functions. The child’s appetite is diminished, and
                    there is frequent vomiting, together with diarrhoea or irregularity of the
                    bowels, the evacuations being clay-coloured and unhealthy. Along with* this
                    there is a falling away in flesh. Importance is to be attached to certain other
                    symptoms present in the early stages, namely, profuse sweating of the head and
                    upper parts of the body, particularly during sleep, with at the same time dry
                    heat of the lower parts and a tendency in the child to kick off all coverings
                    and expose the limbs. At the same time there is great tenderness of the bones,
                    as shown by the pain produced on moving or handling the child. Gradually the
                    changes in the shape of the bones become visible, at first chiefly noticed at
                    the ends of the long bones, as in those of the arm, causing enlargements at the
                    wrists, or in the ribs, producing a knobbed appearance at the junction of their
                    ends with the costal cartilages. The bones also from their softened condition
                    tend to become distorted and misshapen, both by the action of the muscles and by
                    the superincumbent weight of the body. Those of the limbs are bent outwards and
                    forwards, and the child becomes “ bow-legged ” or “ in-kneed ” often to an
                    extreme degree. The trunk of the body likewise shows various alterations and
                    deformities owing to curvatures of the spine, the flattening of the lateral
                    curves of the ribs, and the projection forwards of the sternum. The cavity of
                    the chest may thus be contracted and the development of the thoracic organs
                    interfered with as well as their functions more or less embarrassed. The pelvis
                    undergoes distortion, which may reduce its capacity to a</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r03-0315" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0338.jp2"/>
               <p>degree that in the female may afterwards lead to serious difficulties in
                    parturition. The head of the rickety child is large-looking in its upper part,
                    the individual bones of the cranium sometimes remaining long ununited, while the
                    face is small and ill-developed, and the teeth appear late and fall out or decay
                    early. The constitutional conditions of ill-health continue, and the nutrition
                    and development of the child are greatly retarded.</p>
               <p>The disease may terminate in recovery, with more or less of deformity and
                    dwarfing, the bones although altered in shape becoming firmly ossified, and this
                    is the common result in the majority of instances. On the other hand, during the
                    progress of the disease, various intercurrent ailments are apt to arise which
                    may cause death, such as the infectious fevers, bronchitis and other pulmonary
                    affections, chronic hydrocephalus, convulsions, laryngismus stridulus,
                    &amp;c.</p>
               <p>An acute form of rickets of rare occurrence (really a form of <hi rend="italic"
                        >scurvy, q.v.)</hi> has been described by writers on diseases of children,
                    in which all the symptoms are of more rapid development and progress, the result
                    in many instances being fatal.</p>
               <p>The treatment of rickets is necessarily more hygienic than medicinal, and
                    includes such preventive measures as may be exercised by strict attention to
                    personal health and nutrition on the part of mothers, especially where there
                    appears to be any tendency to a rickety development in any members of the
                    family. Very important also is the avoidance of too prolonged nursing, which by
                    its weakening effects upon the mother’s health is calculated to engender the
                    disease in any succeeding children. At the same time it must be admitted that,
                    when the mother is healthy, her milk abundant, and nursing discontinued before
                    the lapse of the first year, there is no better means of preventing the
                    occurrence of rickets than this method of feeding an infant, the disease, as is
                    well known, being far more frequently met with in children brought up by hand.
                    The management of the child exhibiting any tendency to rickets is of great
                    importance, but can only be alluded to in general terms. The digestive disorders
                    characteristic of the setting in of the disease render necessary the greatest
                    care and watchfulness as to diet. Thus, if the child be not nursed but fed
                    artificially, fresh milk should be almost the only article of diet for at least
                    the first year, and the chief element for the next. When not digested well, as
                    may at times be shown by its appearance as a curd in the evacuations, it may be
                    diluted with water or lime water, or else discontinued for a short time,
                    carefully-made gruel or barley water being substituted. Many of the so-called “
                    infants’ foods ” which are now so extensively used appear to be well adapted for
                    their purpose, but when employed too abundantly and to the exclusion of the due
                    amount of milk are often productive of digestive and intestinal disorders,
                    probably from their containing a greater amount of starchy matter than can be
                    utilized. From the end of the first year light animal soups may occasionally be
                    given with advantage. The medicinal remedies most to be relied on are those
                    which improve the digestive functions and minister to nutrition, and include
                    such agents as the preparations of iron, quinine, and especially cod-liver oil
                    and phosphorus, and the cautious use of extract of thyroid gland has been
                    advocated by Henoch. Of no less importance, however, are abundance of fresh air,
                    cleanliness, warm clothing, and attention to the general hygiene of the child
                    and to regularity in all its functions.</p>
               <p>When the disease is showing evidence of advancing, it is desirable to restrain
                    the child from walking, as far as possible. But this precaution may be to some
                    extent rendered unnecessary by the use of splints and other apparatus as
                    supports for the limbs and body, enabling the child to move about without the
                    risk of bending and deformity of the bones which otherwise would probably be the
                    result.</p>
               <p>The condition formerly known as foetal rickets (achondroplasia or
                    chondrodystrophia foetalis) is now classed as a separate disease. Its chief
                    characteristics are dwarfism with shortening of the limbs and enormous
                    enlargment of the articulations.</p>
