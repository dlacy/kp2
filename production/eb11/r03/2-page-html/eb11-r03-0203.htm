<p><span class="font1">the remains of Pompeii show, was </span><span class="font0">an </span><span class="font1">invention of the Iater Hellemstic age. Reduced copies of statues are found </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">decoration of such capitals in the baths of Caracalla ; the&nbsp;capitals with Victories and trophies in S. Lorenzo Fuori also&nbsp;belonged to a building of pagan times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But the specific achievement of the Roman architect was the artistic application of a new set of principles—those which&nbsp;are expressed 'in the arch, the vault and the dome. The rectilinear buildings of the Greeks, with their direct vertical supports,&nbsp;gave place to vaulted structures in which lateral thrust was&nbsp;called into play. The aesthetic effect of the curves thus brought&nbsp;into prominence was well understood by the Romans; and&nbsp;they were the inventors of the decorative combination of the&nbsp;Greek orders with the arcade. More than this, the erection of&nbsp;vaults and domes of wide span, rendered possible by the use&nbsp;of concrete, gave to the Roman architect the opportunity of&nbsp;dealing artistically with internal spaces. A simple yet grandiose&nbsp;example of this may be found in the Pantheon of Hadrian.&nbsp;Circular buildings were a common feature in Italian architecture;@@<sup>1</sup> the temple of Vesta, which doubtless represented&nbsp;the primitive hut or dwelling of the king, always had this form,&nbsp;and the theme was repeated with many variations, from the&nbsp;well-known circular temple in the Forum Boarium to the&nbsp;fantastic structure with broken outlines at Baalbek. But in&nbsp;the Pantheon the artist lays stress, not on the exterior, which&nbsp;possesses no special effect, but on the interior, whose proportions&nbsp;are carefully determined and give a most impressive result.&nbsp;The same may be said of the great halls of the Imperial Thermae,&nbsp;and as time went on more elaborate architectural schemes were&nbsp;devised to meet the requirements of the Christian Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(£») Sculpture.—</span><span class="font1">It was pointed out above that in the late Republican period specifically Roman art was practically confined to portraiture. Of this we have many fine examples,&nbsp;such as the so-called Domitius Ahenobarbus of the Braccio&nbsp;Nuovo (Plate I. fig. i); and there is a series of busts which&nbsp;possess a special interest in that some of them have been&nbsp;claimed as portraits of Scipio Africanus. The example in the&nbsp;Museo Capitolino (Plate I. fig. 2), with a modern inscription,&nbsp;though executed in the 2nd century </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.,</span><span class="font1"> is clearly copied&nbsp;from a famous Republican original. The baldness of the&nbsp;head has been thought to be derived from the technique of&nbsp;the waxen </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">imagines,</span><span class="font1"> in which the hair was painted; the&nbsp;presence of a scar above the temple, which has given rise to&nbsp;various theories, merely betokens the unsparing realism of the&nbsp;Republican artist. In monumental sculpture our earliest&nbsp;datable example is the altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus, already&nbsp;referred to (Plate II. fig. 10). The ceremonial scene of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Suovetaurilia</span><span class="font1"> fills the centre of the composition; to the left&nbsp;we see the dismissal of veterans for whom </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">diplomata</span><span class="font1"> are being&nbsp;prepared; to the right the troops on active service, both horse&nbsp;and foot, are represented. The artist was clearly inspired&nbsp;by statuary and other types of earlier date, which are grouped&nbsp;in a somewhat loose composition. Augustan art is adequately&nbsp;represented by the Prima Porta statue of the emperor, discovered in 1863 in the Villa of Livia and now in the Braccio&nbsp;Nuovo (Plate III. fig. 17). The attitude of the figure is that&nbsp;of an imperator addressing his army; but there is a characteristic blending of the real with the ideal, for the emperor is not&nbsp;only bareheaded but barefoot, and beside him is a tiny cupid&nbsp;riding on a dolphin, which indicates the descent of the Julian&nbsp;house from Venus. We note, too, how the Roman artist—&nbsp;or the Greek artist interpreting the wishes of the Roman—is&nbsp;scarcely more concerned for the total effect of his work than&nbsp;for the significant details of the decoration. The chasings of&nbsp;the corselet display, as a central subject, the restoration by the&nbsp;Parthian in 20 </span><span class="font0">B.C. </span><span class="font1">of the standards taken from Crassus at&nbsp;Carrhae (53 </span><span class="font0">B.c.). </span><span class="font1">Not content with this, the artist has added&nbsp;a group of personifications indicating sunrise—Sol, Caelus,&nbsp;Aurora and the goddess of the morning dew—as well as Apollo,&nbsp;Diana, Mars and the earth goddess, and two figures symbolical&nbsp;of the western provinces, Gaul and Spain. It is also to be&nbsp;noted that the statue shows abundant traces of its original&nbsp;polychrome tints—brown, yellow, blue, red and pink. It&nbsp;must have been executed later—probably not much later—&nbsp;than 13 </span><span class="font0">n.c., </span><span class="font1">.when Augustus returned from the West, and&nbsp;therefore belongs to the same period as the Ara Pacis Augustac,&nbsp;dedicated January 30, 9 B.C. This altar stood in a walled&nbsp;enclosure with two entrances, measuring 11Î by io| metres.&nbsp;The walls, with their plinth, were about 6 metres in height,&nbsp;and were decorated internally with a frieze of garlands and&nbsp;bucrania, and externally with two bands of relief, the lower&nbsp;consisting of conventional scrolls of acanthus varied with other&nbsp;floral motives, and teeming with bird and insect life, the upper&nbsp;showing processions (Plate II. fig. 11) passing from east to&nbsp;west. The most interesting of these is that on the south wall,&nbsp;which included Augustus himself, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">flamines</span><span class="font1"> and the imperial&nbsp;family.@@<sup>2</sup> On the western face, towards which the processions&nbsp;are directed, we find a scene of sacrifice, with a landscape&nbsp;background, in which the ideal figures of senate and people&nbsp;appear. To the cast front (apparently) belongs the beautiful&nbsp;group of the earth goddess (Tellus) and the spirits of air&nbsp;and water (Plate II. fig. 13). It is impossible to deny the&nbsp;incongruity of this composition with the realistic procession&nbsp;which adjoins it, and we can only suppose that the artist borrowed the group from some Hellenistic precursor and used it&nbsp;in that blend of the real and ideal which, as we saw, was the&nbsp;keynote of the new imperial art.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font1">The lack of public monuments which can be assigned to the Julio-Claudian period is only in part supplied by those&nbsp;of private significance; the most important of these are the&nbsp;sepulchral </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cippi</span><span class="font1"> and other altars, decorated sometimes with&nbsp;figure-subjects, but Iargely with plant and animal forms&nbsp;rendered with the utmost naturalism. The altar with plane-leaves in the Museo delle Terme </span><span class="font0">(fig. </span><span class="font1">38), though perhaps not</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">later than Augustus, is typical of the spirit in which vegetable forms were treated under the first dynasty. We may take a&nbsp;female portrait discovered in a ist-ccntury house on the right&nbsp;bank of the Tiber (Plate I. fig. 3) as an example of the portraiture of this period, which shows great technical merit but&nbsp;a touch of conventionality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The sculpture of the Flavian period finds its best-known example in the reliefs of the Arch of Titus. This has but a&nbsp;single archway; the piers had no sculptured decoration, and&nbsp;the narrow frieze which surmounts the architrave is perfunctorily executed. But the long panels on either side of the&nbsp;passage, which represent the triumph of Titus and the spoils&nbsp;of Jerusalem, have been deemed (by Wickhoff) worthy of a&nbsp;place in the history of art beside the masterpieces of Velazquez&nbsp;—the “ Hilanderas ” and the “ Surrender of Breda and</span></p><div>
