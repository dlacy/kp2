<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sacrijiculus</span><span class="font1"> performed his functions in the Comitium, and the inscription may refer to him. This may be the stele to which&nbsp;Dionysius of Halicarnassus refers as marking the tomb of Hostus&nbsp;HostiHus (father of Tullus Hostilius) whose site (according to those&nbsp;who believed in the translation of Romulus to heaven) was marked&nbsp;by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lapis niger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Senaculum appears to have been a place of preliminary meeting for the senate before entering the Curia (Liv. xli. 27;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Val. Max. ii.2, 6); it adjoined the temple of Concord, and when this was rebuilt on an enlarged scale in the&nbsp;reign of Augustus it appears probable that its large</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">projecting portico became the Senaculum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A great part of the north-east side of the Fcrum was occupied by two basilicae, which were more than once rebuilt under different&nbsp;names. The first of these appears to have been adjacent&nbsp;to the Curia, on its west side; it was called the Basilica&nbsp;Porcia, and was founded by the elder Cato in 185 </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">B.c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(see Liv. xxxix. 44, and Plut. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cato Major</span><span class="font1">, 19); it was burnt with the Curia at Clodius’s funeral. On the.north side of the Forum&nbsp;another basilica, called Aemilía et Fulvia (Varro vi. 4), was built&nbsp;in 179 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font1"> by the censors M. Fulvius and M. Aemilius Lepidus;<sup>@@1&nbsp;</sup>it stood, according to Livy (xl. 51), “post argentarias novas,” the&nbsp;line of silversmiths* shops along the north-east side of the Forum.&nbsp;In 50 </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">B.c. </span><span class="font1">it was rebuilt by L. Aemilius Paulus with Caesar’s money&nbsp;(Plut. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Coes.</span><span class="font1"> 29; Appian, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bell. Civ.</span><span class="font1"> ii. 26), and was more than once&nbsp;restored within the few subsequent years by members of the same&nbsp;family. Its later name was the Basilica Pauli, and it was remarkable for its magnificent columns of Phrygian marble (Plin. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">H.N.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">xxxvi. 102) or pavonazzetto. Part of the western end was still&nbsp;standing in the 16th century, and was drawn by Giuliano da Sangallo&nbsp;(Iluelsen, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Roman Forum,</span><span class="font1"> fig. 61). Recent excavations have&nbsp;shown that it was approached from the Forum by a flight of&nbsp;steps leading to a two-storeyed colonnade. Behind this was a&nbsp;row of tabernae in the middle of which was the entrance to the&nbsp;main hall, consisting in a nave and three aisles (two on the north&nbsp;side).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Near the middle of the north-east side of the Forum stood also the small bronze temple of Janus,<sup>@@2 </sup>the doors of which were shut&nbsp;on those rare occasions when Rome was at peace.<sup>@@3</sup> A&nbsp;first brass of Nero shows it as a small celia, with richly&nbsp;ornamented frieze and cornice. Another aedicula near&nbsp;that of Janus was the shrine of Venus Cloacina (or the Purifier),&nbsp;on the line of the cloaca which runs under the Basilica Aemilia;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1 </sup>The Forum Piscatorium or fish-market appears to have been at the back of this basilica (see Liv. xl. 51).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@2 </sup>The original temple was one of the prehistoric buildings attributed to Romulus and Tati us (Serv. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ad Aen.</span><span class="font1"> i. 291), or by Livy (i. 19) to Numa.</span></p>
