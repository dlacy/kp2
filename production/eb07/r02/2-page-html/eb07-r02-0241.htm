<p><span class="font3">ROSTAK, a city of Arabia, in the district of Ommon. It is the residence of the imaum ; but Muskat is the chief&nbsp;town through which the intercourse with the Europeans is&nbsp;carried on. It is situated near Jebel Akdar, the largest&nbsp;and highest mountain in Ommon, and is celebrated for its&nbsp;fine grapes. It is seventy miles west from Muskat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ROSTOCK, a city of the grand duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, which was formerly the capital of the two duchies of Mecklenburg, but since 1695 it has become the&nbsp;sole possession of the present branch. It is situated on the navigable river Wornow, about eight miles from the Baltic Sea.&nbsp;It is strongly fortified, and contains a citadel, seven churches,&nbsp;2180 houses of an antique style of building, and about&nbsp;16,000 inhabitants. It is the place at which the assembly&nbsp;of the states, and the courts of law, are held ; and it contains&nbsp;a university founded in 1419, which has a due number of&nbsp;professors, and about a hundred students, to which are attached an observatory, an anatomical theatre, and a library of&nbsp;thirty thousand volumes. It is the most considerable trading place in the German part of the Baltic, and the export of&nbsp;wheat is greater than from any other German port. It has a&nbsp;variety of manufactures for brandy, vinegar, beer, cloths,&nbsp;glass, leather, iron ware, soap, sugar, and linen, and 140 ships&nbsp;belonging to the port. This place gave birth to Prince&nbsp;Blucher, to whom a statue has been erected in the square.&nbsp;Long. 12. 32. E. Lat. 54. 10. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ROSTOW, a city of Russia, in the province of Jaros-low, the capital of a circle of its own name, situated on the lake of Nero or Rostow. It contains twenty-four churches,&nbsp;six hospitals, 1016 houses, and 6500 inhabitants ; and has&nbsp;extensive trade in corn, hemp, linen, tallow, leather, honey,&nbsp;and wax, and some in salt. It is 530 miles from St Petersburg. Long. 39. 35. E. Lat. 58. 57. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ROSTRA, a part of the Roman forum, in which orations, pleadings, and funeral harangues, were delivered. It derived its name from the circumstance of its exhibiting&nbsp;the beaks of ships taken from the Antiates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ROSTRUM literally denotes the beak or bill of a bird ; and hence it has been figuratively applied to the beak or&nbsp;head of a ship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ROT, a very fatal disease incident to sheep, arising from wet seasons, and too moist pasture. It is very difficult of&nbsp;cure, and is attended with the singular circumstance of a&nbsp;kind of animals being found in the blood-vessels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ROTA, a city of Spain, in the province of Seville, and the district of St Lucar. It stands on the bay of Cadiz,&nbsp;and being strongly fortified, forms one of the means of defence to that important estuary. It is situated on an elevation, and, like most Spanish towns, has a beautiful appearance when viewed at a distance. It contains some very fine&nbsp;buildings, and about 6500 inhabitants, who partly follow the&nbsp;occupation of fishing, whilst others deal in wine, as this&nbsp;place supplies the kind of red wine known in England by&nbsp;the name of Tent, which is produced on the banks of the&nbsp;river Tinto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rota, the name of an ecclesiastical court of Rome, composed of twelve prelates, of whom one must be a German, another a Frenchman, and two Spaniards ; the other eight&nbsp;are Italians, three of whom must be Romans, and the other&nbsp;five a Bolognese, a Ferraran, a Milanese, a Venetian, and&nbsp;a Tuscan. This is one of the most august tribunals in Rome,&nbsp;which takes cognizance, by appeal, of all suits in the territory of the church, and also of all matters, beneficiary and&nbsp;patrimonial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rota Aristotelica, or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Aristotle's Wheel,</span><span class="font3"> denotes a celebrated problem in mechanics, concerning the motion&nbsp;or rotation of a wheel about its axis, so called because&nbsp;Aristotle was the first who took notice of it. The difficulty&nbsp;of it may be represented in the following manner. While&nbsp;the circle makes one revolution on its centre, advancing at&nbsp;the same time in a right line along a plane, it describes on&nbsp;that plane a right line which is equal to its circumference.&nbsp;Now, if this circle carry with it another smaller circle, concentric with it, like the nave of a coach-wheel, then this&nbsp;smaller circle or nave will describe a line in the time of&nbsp;the revolution which shall be equal to that of the large&nbsp;wheel or circumference itself, because its centre advances&nbsp;in a right line as fast as that of the wheel does, being in&nbsp;reality the same with it- Aristotle attempted to solve this&nbsp;problem ; but his solution can only be regarded as a good&nbsp;account of the difficulty. It was next attempted by Galileo, who had recourse to an infinite number of infinitely&nbsp;small vacuities in the right line described by the two&nbsp;circles, and imagined that the little circle never applies its&nbsp;circumference to those vacuities, but in reality only applies it to a line equal to its own circumference, though it&nbsp;appears to have applied it to a much larger. This, however, is nothing to the purpose. According to Tacquet,&nbsp;the little circle making its rotation more slowly than the&nbsp;great one, does, on that account, describe a line longer than&nbsp;its own circumference, yet without applying any point of&nbsp;its circumference to more than one point of its base. This&nbsp;is not more satisfactory than the former. After the fruitless endeavours of many great men, M. Dortous de Mey-ran, a French gentleman, had the good fortune to hit upon&nbsp;a solution which, after being fully examined by a committee of the Academy of Sciences, was declared to be satisfactory. The following is his solution. The wheel of a&nbsp;coach is only acted on or drawn in a right line ; its rotation or circular motion arises purely from the resistance of&nbsp;the ground. Now this resistance is equal to the force which&nbsp;draws the wheel in a right line, as it defeats that direction,&nbsp;and therefore the causes of the two motions are equal. The&nbsp;wheel therefore describes a right line on the ground equal&nbsp;to its circumference. On the contrary, the nave is drawn&nbsp;in a right line by the same force as the wheel, but it only&nbsp;turns round because the wheel does so, and can only turn&nbsp;in the same time with it. Hence its circular velocity is&nbsp;less than that of the wheel, in the ratio of the two circumferences, and therefore its circular motion is less than the&nbsp;rectilinear one. Since it must describe a right line equal&nbsp;to that of the wheel, it can only do it by partly sliding and&nbsp;partly revolving, the sliding part being more or less as the&nbsp;nave itself is smaller or greater.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
