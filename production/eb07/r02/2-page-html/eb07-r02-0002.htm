<p><span class="font0">the arrangement of this elevation which distributes them over the surface of the earth. This appears to be accomplished with considerable regularity; and, except the great&nbsp;desert of Kobi on the confines of Chinese Tartary, we do&nbsp;not remember any very extensive tract of ground that is&nbsp;deprived of those channels for voiding the superfluous&nbsp;waters; and even there they are far from being redundant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The courses of rivers give us the best general method for judging of the elevation of a country. Thus it appears&nbsp; that Savoy and Switzerland are the highest grounds of Europe, from whence the ground slopes in every direction.&nbsp;From the Alps proceed the Danube and the Rhine, whose&nbsp;courses mark the two great valleys, into which many lateral&nbsp;streams descend. The Po also and the Rhone come from&nbsp;the same head, and with a steeper and shorter course find&nbsp;their way to the sea through valleys of less breadth and&nbsp;length. On the west side of the valleys of the Rhine and&nbsp;the Rhone the ground rises pretty fast, so that few tributary streams come into them from that side; and from this&nbsp;gentle elevation France slopes to the westward. If a line,&nbsp;nearly straight, but bending a little to the northward, be&nbsp;drawn from the head of Savoy and Switzerland all the way&nbsp;to Solikamskoy in Siberia, it will nearly pass through the&nbsp;most elevated part of Europe; for in this tract most of the&nbsp;rivers have their rise. On the left go off the various feeders of the Elbe, the Oder, the Wesel, the Niemen, the&nbsp;Duna, the Neva, the Dwina, the Petzora. On the right,&nbsp;after passing the feeders of the Danube, we see the sources&nbsp;of the Sereth and Pruth, the Dniester, the Bog, the Dnieper, the Don, and the mighty Volga. The elevation, however, is extremely moderate; and it appears from the levels&nbsp;taken with the barometer by the Abbé Chappe d’Anteroche,&nbsp;that the head of the Volga is not more than 470 feet above&nbsp;the surface of the ocean. And we may observe here, by&nbsp;the by, that its mouth, where it discharges its waters into&nbsp;the Caspian Sea, is undoubtedly lower by many feet than&nbsp;the surface of the ocean. (See Pneumatics. ) Spain&nbsp;and Finland, with Lapland, Norway, and Sweden, form&nbsp;two detached parts, which have little symmetry with the&nbsp;rest of Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A chain of mountains begins in Nova Zembla, and stretches due south to near the Caspian Sea, dividing Europe from Asia. About three or four degrees north of the&nbsp;Caspian Sea it bends to the south-east, traverses Western&nbsp;Tartary, and passing between the Tengis and Zaizan lakes,&nbsp;it then branches to the east and south. The eastern branch&nbsp;runs to the shores of Korea and Kamtschatka. The southern branch traverses Turkestan and Thibet, separating&nbsp;them from India, and at the head of the kingdom of Ava&nbsp;joins an arm stretching from the great eastern branch, and&nbsp;here forms the centre of a very singular radiation. Chains&nbsp;of mountains issue from it in every direction. Three or&nbsp;four of them keep very close together, dividing the continent into narrow slips, which have each a great river flowing in the middle, and reaching to the extreme points of&nbsp;Malacca, Cambodia, and Cochin-china. From the same&nbsp;central point proceeds another great ridge due east, and&nbsp;passes a little north of Canton in China. We called this a&nbsp;singular centre; for though it sends off so many branches,&nbsp;it is by no means the most elevated part of the continent.&nbsp;In the triangle which is included between the first southern&nbsp;ridge (which comes from between the lakes Tengis and&nbsp;Zaizan), the great eastern ridge, and its branch which almost unites with the southern ridge, lie the Boutan and&nbsp;part of Thibet; and the many little rivers which occupy its&nbsp;surface flow southward and eastward, uniting a little to the&nbsp;north of the centre often mentioned, and then pass through&nbsp;a gorge eastward into China. The higher grounds (if we&nbsp;except the ridges of mountains which are boundaries) of the&nbsp;continent seem to be in the country of the Calmucs, about&nbsp;96° east from London, and latitude 43° or 45° north. It is&nbsp;represented as a fine though sandy country, having many&nbsp;little rivers which lose themselves in the sand, or end in&nbsp;little salt lakes. This elevation stretches north-east to a&nbsp;great distance; and in this tract we find the heads of the&nbsp;Irtish, Selenga, and Tunguskaia (the great feeders of the&nbsp;Oby), the Olenitz, the Lena, the Yana, and some other&nbsp;rivers, which all go off to the north. On the other side we&nbsp;have the great river Amur, and many smaller rivers, whose&nbsp;names are not familiar. The Hoangho, the great river of&nbsp;China, rises on the south side of the great eastern ridge we&nbsp;have so often mentioned. This elevation, which is a continuation of the former, is somewhat of the same complexion, being very sandy, and at present is a desert of prodigious extent. A great ridge of mountains begins at the&nbsp;south-east corner of the Euxine Sea, and proceeds eastward, ranging along the south side of the Caspian, and, still&nbsp;advancing, unites with the mountains first mentioned in&nbsp;Thibet, sending off some branches to the south, which divide Persia, India, and Thibet. From the south side of&nbsp;this ridge flow the Euphrates, Tigris, Indus, and Ganges,&nbsp;and from the north the ancient Oxus and many unknown&nbsp;streams.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of the rivers of Africa we still know but little. The Nile indeed is perhaps better known than any river out of&nbsp;Europe; and of its source and progress we have given a&nbsp;full account in a separate article. See Nile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By the register of the weather kept by Mr Bruce at Gondar in 1770 and 1771, it appears that the greatest rains&nbsp;fall about the beginning of July. He says that at an average each month after June it doubles its rains. The ca-lish or canal is opened at Cairo about the 9th of August,&nbsp;when the river has risen fourteen peeks (each twenty-one&nbsp;inches), and the waters begin to decrease about the 10th&nbsp;of September. Hence we may form a conjecture concerning the time which the latter employs in coming from Abyssinia. Mr Bruce supposes it nine days, which would require&nbsp;a velocity of not less than fourteen feet in a second; a thing&nbsp;past belief, and inconsistent with all our notions. The general slope of the river is greatly diminished by several&nbsp;great cataracts; and Mr Bruce expressly says that he&nbsp;might have come down from Sennaar to the cataracts of&nbsp;Syene in a boat, and that it is navigable for boats far above&nbsp;Sennaar. He came from Syene to Cairo by water. We&nbsp;apprehend that no boat would venture down a stream moving even six feet in a second, and none could row up if the&nbsp;velocity was three feet. As the waters begin to decrease&nbsp;about the 10th of September, we must conclude that the&nbsp;water then flowing past Cairo had left Abyssinia when the&nbsp;rains had greatly abated. Judging in this way, we must&nbsp;still allow the stream a velocity of more than six feet. Had&nbsp;the first swell at Cairo been noticed in 1770 or 1771, we&nbsp;might have guessed better. The year that Thevenot was&nbsp;in Egypt, the first swell of eight peeks was observed on&nbsp;the 28th of January. The calish was opened for fourteen&nbsp;peeks on the 14th of August, and the waters began to decrease on the 23d of September, having risen to twenty-one and two-third peeks. We may suppose a similar progress at Cairo corresponding to Mr Bruce’s observations at&nbsp;Gondar, and date every thing five days earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The frame-work (so to call it) of America is better known, and is singular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A chain of mountains begins, or at least is found, in longitude 110° west of London, and latitude 40° north, on the northern confines of the kingdom of Mexico, and, stretching&nbsp;southward through that kingdom, forms the ridge of the&nbsp;neck of land which separates North from South America,&nbsp;and keeping almost close to the shore, ranges along the&nbsp;whole western coast of South America, terminating at Cape&nbsp;Horn. In its course it sends off branches, which after separating from it for a few leagues, rejoin it again, enclosing&nbsp;valleys of great extent from north to south, and of prodi-</span></p>
