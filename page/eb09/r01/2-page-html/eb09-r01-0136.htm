<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">to Rome which could be as satisfactorily and far more promptly decided before the national tribunals.@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>! While the popular feeling in Germany was being thus&nbsp;effectually alienated from the papal see, the learning of&nbsp;Germany was also pursuing that ominous track, first&nbsp;delineated by Gregory of Heimburg, which marks its complete divergence from the Italian humanism. The names&nbsp;of Johann von Goch (d. 1475), Johann Wessel (d. 1489),&nbsp;Johann Reuchlin (d. 1522), and Erasmus stand associated,&nbsp;although in different ways, with a great movement which,&nbsp;by attacking at once the doctrine and the discipline of the&nbsp;church, opened up the way for Luther. Goch and Wessel&nbsp;were among the first to give systematic form to the opposition to the existing ecclesiastical system, and their criticism&nbsp;included both popes and councils as ultimate authorities&nbsp;in matters of faith. They inveighed with especial force&nbsp;against the doctrines of indulgences, veneration of saints,&nbsp;and purgatory, and they denied that confession, the Lord’s&nbsp;Supper, and extreme unction were to be regarded as&nbsp;sacraments of divine institution. During the years 1511&nbsp;to 1516 Reuchlin carried on a memorable struggle against&nbsp;the monks of Cologne in defence of the New Learning&nbsp;and of improved canons of textual criticism. In the year&nbsp;1516 Erasmus put forth the first edition of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Novum&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Instrumentum.</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Side by side with these more elaborate&nbsp;efforts there was going on another literary movement which&nbsp;in its influence on the popular mind was not less considerable. Ever since the days of the early Lollards satire had&nbsp;been found a not altogether ineffectual weapon in assailing&nbsp;those abuses in the church which argument and remonstrance seemed powerless to reform. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Praise of Folly,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">from the pen of Erasmus, which appeared in 1511, seconded&nbsp;the graver efforts of Reuchlin, and successfully held up to&nbsp;ridicule those monastic orders of whose greed and dull&nbsp;obstructive activity Germany was already so weary. But&nbsp;even this brilliant effort paled in its effects when compared&nbsp;with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Epistoloe Obscurorum Virorum,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> which appeared&nbsp;in 1515-16. These letters, of which Ulrich von Hutten&nbsp;and his friend Crotus Rubianus were the principal authors,&nbsp;were a series of broadly humorous fabrications, purporting&nbsp;to be written by members of the obscurantist party themselves. A more skilful mode of exposing the ignorance&nbsp;and imbecility of thought which characterized the average&nbsp;intelligence of the monks of those days could hardly have&nbsp;been devised; and the success of the artifice appeared&nbsp;complete when it became known that certain stolid monks&nbsp;had been led to approve the volume and even aid in its&nbsp;circulation as a genuine and valid defence of the views&nbsp;which they upheld.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">These effective demonstrations, it is to be noted, were not merely the outcome of that widespread discontent&nbsp;above described, but resemble rather a series of sparks&nbsp;elicited by immediate contact between the German mind&nbsp;and Rome; and it is of no little interest to mark the&nbsp;effect produced on three of the most eminent representatives of the new movement by their visit, within a few&nbsp;years of each other, to the capital and by the contemplation of the splendour of the Curia and the moral degrada-&gt; tion of its members. Of these three observers the first&nbsp;<sup>)f</sup> was Erasmus, who visited the capital in 1506. His lively&nbsp;<sup>s</sup>’sense of the incongruous was not a little excited by the&nbsp;spectacle of the warlike pontiff, Julius II., whom, in his&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Praise of Folly</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, written a few years later, he describes as&nbsp;subverting alike the laws, peace, and religion. But Erasmus&nbsp;himself does not appear to have been greatly scandalized.&nbsp;He affects, indeed, to be somewhat uncertain whether it&nbsp;is Germany that has copied Rome or whether Rome has&nbsp;not rather copied a certain class of German prelates, who&nbsp;seem to look upon the battlefield as the fitting place where&nbsp;to render up their souls to God. Somewhat later, writing&nbsp;in a graver mood, he declares that nothing will ever efface&nbsp;his more pleasing recollections of the great city,—its&nbsp;freedom of discourse, its intellectual illumination, its&nbsp;works of art, its libraries, and its scholars. Four years&nbsp;after Erasmus came an Augustinian monk from Erfurt,&nbsp;full of reverence for the traditions, the grandeur, and the&nbsp;sanctity of Rome. Martin Luther appears to have been&nbsp;less struck than was Erasmus by the unpriestly character&nbsp;of Julius II., who, as he admits, maintained order and&nbsp;watched over the sanitary condition of the Sacred City.&nbsp;But he was shocked beyond measure by the corruption,&nbsp;the profanity, and the immoral lives of the Roman clergy.&nbsp;The fond illusion of his monastic life was at an end; and&nbsp;he returned to Germany not only prepared to counsel&nbsp;resistance to papal extortion but shaken in his whole&nbsp;allegiance to the holy see. A few months after Luther&nbsp;came Ulrich von Hutten. It ־would be difficult to select a&nbsp;better representative of the temper and feeling of the&nbsp;higher classes in Germany at that time. To pride of&nbsp;birth and devotion to the New Learning he united a love&nbsp;of adventure which no physical suffering or misfortune&nbsp;seemed able to subdue, and a chivalrous spirit which could&nbsp;but impatiently brook the assertion of even legitimate&nbsp;authority. Already burning with resentment at the systematic extortion to which his countrymen were subjected,&nbsp;his feelings were still further intensified as he listened to&nbsp;the contemptuous language and observed the supercilious&nbsp;demeanour which marked the Roman estimate of those&nbsp;who bore the German name. He heard from an eye-witness a description of Julius II. as that pontiff had presented&nbsp;himself to the world at the siege of Mirandola, with “wild&nbsp;eye, brazen front, and threatening mien.” On his return&nbsp;to his fatherland Hutten condensed into epigrammatic&nbsp;Latin verse, beside the suppressed fury of which the&nbsp;polished satire of Erasmus seems to pale, a description of&nbsp;what he had seen and heard, and denounced with terrible&nbsp;effect the wdiole system of bulls, indulgences, and other&nbsp;devices whereby an avaricious prelate was wringing dishonest gains from a long-suffering nation. Few literary&nbsp;assailants have ever possessed a greater power of irritating&nbsp;an antagonist than did Ulrich von Hutten, and considerations of generosity or expediency rarely deterred him. It&nbsp;was generally expected when Leo X. ascended the pontifical&nbsp;throne that he would be anxious to sheathe the sword&nbsp;which his predecessor had wielded so vigorously, and his&nbsp;countrymen already hailed him as the “ restorer of peace.”&nbsp;By that epithet Hutten too vouchsafed to address him,&nbsp;but it was in a dedication to the pontiff of p, reprint of&nbsp;Laurentius Valla’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Treatise on the Donation of Constantine,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and the seeming act of homage was thus artfully appended&nbsp;to pages exceptionally calculated to wound the papal&nbsp;susceptibilities.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">It must, however, be admitted that the character of the German episcopate at this time was such that it scarcely&nbsp;appeared to advantage even when compared with that of&nbsp;the ecclesiastics of the Roman Curia.
