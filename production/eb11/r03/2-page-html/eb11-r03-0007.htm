<p><span class="font1">tured at Vienna in a mean disguise (December 20th, 1192) and strictly confined in the duke’s castle of DUrenstein on the&nbsp;Danube. His mishap was soon known to England, but the&nbsp;regents were for some weeks uncertain of his whereabouts.&nbsp;This is the foundation for the tale of bis discovery by the&nbsp;faithful minstrel Blondel, which first occurs in a French&nbsp;romantic chronicle of the next century. Early in 1193 Leopold&nbsp;surrendered his prize, under compulsion, to the emperor&nbsp;Henry VI., who was aggrieved both by the support which&nbsp;the PIantagenets had given to the family of Henry the Lion&nbsp;and also by Richard’s recognition of Tancred in Sicily. Although the detention of a crusader was contrary to public&nbsp;law, Richard was compelled to purchase his release by the&nbsp;payment of a heavy ransom and by doing homage to the&nbsp;emperor for England. The ransom demanded was 150,000&nbsp;marks; though it was never discharged in full, the resources&nbsp;of England were taxed to the utmost for the first instalments;&nbsp;and to this occasion we may trace the beginning of secular&nbsp;taxation levied on movable property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Richard reappeared in England in March 1194; Out his stay lasted only a few weeks, and the rcmainder of his reign&nbsp;was entirely devoted to his continental interests. He left&nbsp;England to be governed by Hubert Walter </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font1"> and his&nbsp;personal authority was seldom asserted except by demands&nbsp;for new subsidies. The rule of the Plantagenets was still&nbsp;popular in Normandy and Aquitaine; but thesc provinces were&nbsp;unable or unwilling to pay for their own defence. Though&nbsp;Richard proved himself consistently the superior of Philip&nbsp;in the field, the difficulty of raising and paying forces to resist&nbsp;the French increased year by year. Richard could only stand&nbsp;on the defensive; the keynote of his later policy is given by&nbsp;the building of the famous Château Gaillard at Les Andelys&nbsp;(1196) to protect the lower courses of the Seine against invasion from the side of France. He did not live to see the&nbsp;futility of such bulwarks. In 1199 a claim to treasure-trove&nbsp;embroiled him with the viscount of Limoges. He harried the&nbsp;Limousin and laid siege to the castle of Chalus; while directing&nbsp;an assault he was wounded in the shoulder by a crossbow bolt,&nbsp;and, the wound mortifying from unskilful treatment or his&nbsp;own want of care, he died on the 6th of April 1199. He was&nbsp;buried by his own desire at his father’s feet in the church of&nbsp;Fontevrault. Here his effigy may still be seen.@@<sup>1</sup> Though&nbsp;contemporary, it does not altogether agree with the portraits&nbsp;on his Great Seal, which give the impression of greater strength&nbsp;and even of cruelty. The Fontevrault bust is no doubt&nbsp;idealized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The most accomplished and versatile representative of his gifted family, Richard was, in his lifetime and long afterwards, a favourite hero with troubadours and romancers. This&nbsp;was natural, as he belonged to their brotherhood and himself&nbsp;wrote lyrics of no mean quality. But his history shows that&nbsp;he by no means embodied the current ideal of chivalrous excellence. His memory is stained by one act of needless cruelty,&nbsp;thc massacre of over two thousand Saracen prisoners at Acre;&nbsp;and his fury, when thwarted or humbled, was ungovernable.&nbsp;A brave soldier, an experienced and astute general, he was&nbsp;never happier than when engaged </span><span class="font0">in </span><span class="font1">war. As a ruler he was&nbsp;equally profuse and rapacious. Not one useful measure can&nbsp;be placed to his credit; and it was by a fortunate accident&nbsp;that he found, in Hubert Walter, an administrator who had&nbsp;the skill to mitigate the consequences of a reckless fiscal policy.&nbsp;Richard’s wife was Berengaria, daughter of Sancho VI., king&nbsp;of Navarre, whom he married in Cyprus in May 1191. She&nbsp;was with the king at Acre later in the same year, and during&nbsp;his imprisonment passed her time in Sicily, in Rome and in&nbsp;France. Husband and wife met again in 1195, and the queen&nbsp;long survived the king, residing chiefly at Le Mans. She died&nbsp;soon after 1230. Berengaria founded a Cistercian monastery&nbsp;at Espau.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> The remains of Richard, together with those of Henrys II. and his queen Eleanor, were removed in thc 17th century from their&nbsp;tombs to another part of the church. They were rediscovered in&nbsp;1910 during the restoration of the abbey undertaken by the French&nbsp;government.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>

<p><span class="font1">RICHARD II. (1367-1400), king of England, younger son of Edward the Black Prince by Joan “ the Fair Maid of Kent,”&nbsp;was born at Bordeaux on the 6th of January 1367. He was&nbsp;brought to England in 1371, and after his father’s death was,&nbsp;on the petition of the Commons in parliament, created prince&nbsp;of Wales on the 20th of November 1376. When Edward III.&nbsp;died, on the 21st of June 1377, Richard became king. Popular&nbsp;opinion had credited John of Gaunt with designs on the throne.&nbsp;This was not justified; nevertheless, the rivalry of the boy-king’s uncles added another to the troubles due to the war,&nbsp;the Black Death and the prospect of a long minority. At&nbsp;first the government was conducted by a council appointed&nbsp;by parliament. The council was honest, but the difficulties&nbsp;of the situation were too great. The ill-considered poll-tax&nbsp;of 1381 was the occasion, though not the real cause, of the&nbsp;Peasants’ Revolt in that year. The ministcrs were quite&nbsp;unequal to the crisis, and when Wat Tyler and bis followers&nbsp;got possession of London, it was Richard who showed a precocious tact and confidence in handling it. It was the boy-king who met and temporized with the rebels on the 13th of&nbsp;June at Mile End, and again next day at Smithfield; and be&nbsp;who, with courageous presence of mind, saved the situation&nbsp;when Tyler was killed, by calling on them to take him for&nbsp;their leader. From this time Richard began to assert himself.&nbsp;His chief ministers, appointed by parliament in 1382, were&nbsp;thc carl of Arundel and Michael de la Pole. Arundel Richard&nbsp;disliked, and dismissed next year, when he began his personal&nbsp;government. Pole, whom he retained as chancellor and made&nbsp;earl of Suffolk, was a well-chosen adviser. But others, and&nbsp;especially his youthful favourite Robert de Vere, promoted&nbsp;by unheard-of honour to be marquess of Dublin and duke of&nbsp;Ireland, were less worthy. Further, Richard made his own&nbsp;position difficult by lavish extravagance and unseemly outbursts of temper. He chafed under the restraint of his relatives,&nbsp;and therefore encouraged John of Gaunt in his Spanish enterprise. This gave the less scrupulous Thomas of Gloucester&nbsp;his opportunity. Gloucester, supported by Arundel, attacked&nbsp;his nephew’s ministers in the parliament of 1386, and by open&nbsp;hints at deposition forced Richard to submit to a council of&nbsp;control. When Richard, with the aid of his friends and by&nbsp;the advice of subservient judges, planned a reversal of the&nbsp;parliament, Gloucester, at the head of the so-called lords appellant, anticipated him. Richard had been premature and ill-advised. Gloucester had the advantage of posing as the head&nbsp;of the constitutional party. The king’s friends were driven&nbsp;into exile or executed, and he himself forced to submit to thc&nbsp;loss of all real power (May 1388). Richard changed his</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
