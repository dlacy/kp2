<p><label>REGENT</label>
one who governs a kingdom during the minority or abſence oſ the king.</p><p>In France, the queen-mother had the regency oſ the kingdom during the minority oſ the king, under the title oſ <hi rend="italic">queen-regent.</hi></p><p>In England, the methods oſ appointir∕ this guardian or regent have been ſo various, and the duration oſ his power ſo uncertain, that ſrom hence alont it may be collected that his office is unknown to the common law ; aud therefore (as Sir Edward Coke ſays, 4 Inſt. 58.) the ſureſt way is to have him made by authority oſ the great council in parliament. The earl of Pembroke by his own authority affumed in very troubleſome times the regency oſ Henry III. who was then only nine years old ; but was declared of full age by the pope at 17, confirmed the great charter at ιb, and took upon him the adminiſtration oſ the government at 20. A guardian and councils oſ regency were named for Edward III. by the parliament, which depofed his father ; the young king being then 1 5, and not affuming the government till three years after, when Richard II. ſucceeded' at the age of 11, the duke oſ Lancaſter took upon him the management oſ the kingdom till the parliament met, rvhich appointed a nominal council to affiſthim. Henry V. on his death-bed named a regent and a guar-dian ſor his infant ſon Henry VI. then nine months old t but the parliament altered his diſpoſition, and appointed a protector and council, with a ſpecial limited authority. Both theſe princes remained iu a ſtate oſ pupilage till the age oſ 23. Edward V. at tlie age oſ 13, was recommended by his father to the care oſ the duke of <hi rend="sub">f</hi> Glouceſter; who was declared protector by the privy-council. The ſtatutes 25 Hen. VIII. c. 12. and 28' Hen. VIII. c. 7. provided, that the fucceiſor, if a male and under 18, or if a female and under 16, ſhould he till ſuch age in tbe governance of his or her natural mother, (if approved by the king), and ſuch other counſellors as his majeſty ſhould by will or otherwiſe appoint : and he accordingly appointed his 16 executors· to have the government of his ion Edward VI. and the kingdom, which executors elected the eaιl of Hartford protector. Tlιe ſtatutes 24 Geo. II. c. 24. in caſe the crown ſhould deſcend to any of the children of Frederic late prince of wales under the age of 18, appointed the prîncefs dowager ;—and that of 5 Geo. III. c.</p><p>27. in caſe of a like deſcent to any ∂f his preſent majeſty’s children, empowers the king to name either the</p>
