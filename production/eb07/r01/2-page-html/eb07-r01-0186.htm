<p><span class="font0">tical sciences are apt to entertain doubts or false notions connected with this circumstance, which we shall attempt&nbsp;to remove.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If a fluid were perfectly incompressible, and were contained in a vessel incapable of extension, it is impossible that any void could be formed behind the body ; and in&nbsp;this case it is not very easy to see how motion could be&nbsp;performed in it. A sphere moved in such a medium could&nbsp;not advance the smallest distance, unless </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">some</span><span class="font0"> particles of&nbsp;the fluid, in filling up the space left by it, moved with a&nbsp;velocity next to infinite. Some degree of compressibility,&nbsp;however small, seems necessary. If this be insensible, it&nbsp;may be rigidly demonstrated, that an external force of compression will make no </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sensible</span><span class="font0"> change in the internal motions, or in the resistances. This indeed is not obvious,&nbsp;but is an immediate consequence of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">quaquaversum&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">pressure of fluids. As much as the pressure is augmented&nbsp;by the external compressions in one side of a body, so much&nbsp;is it augmented on the other side ; and the same must be&nbsp;said of every particle. Nothing more is necessary for securing the same motions by the same partial and internal&nbsp;forces ; and this is fully verified by experiment. Water&nbsp;remains equally fluid under any compressions. In some of&nbsp;Sir Isaac Newton’s experiments, balls of four inches diameter were made so light as to preponderate in water only&nbsp;three grains. These balls descended in the same manner&nbsp;as they would have descended in a fluid where the resistance was equal in every part ; yet, when they were near&nbsp;the bottom of a vessel nine feet deep, the compression round&nbsp;them was at least 2400 times the moving force ; whereas,&nbsp;when near the top of the vessel, it was not above 50 or 60&nbsp;times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But in a fluid sensibly compressible, or which is not confined, a void may be left behind the body. Its motion may be so swift that the surrounding pressure may not suffice&nbsp;for filling up the deserted space ; and, in this case, a statical pressure will be added to the resistance. This may&nbsp;be the case in a vessel or pond of water having an open&nbsp;surface exposed to the finite or limited pressure of the atmosphere. The question now is, whether the resistance&nbsp;will be increased by an increase of external pressure ? Supposing a sphere moving near the surface of water, and another moving equally fast at four times the depth. If the&nbsp;motion be so swift that a void is formed in both cases, there&nbsp;is no doubt but that the sphere which moves at the greatest depth is most resisted by the pressure of the water. If&nbsp;there is no void in either case, then, because the quadruple&nbsp;depth would cause the water to flow in with only a double&nbsp;velocity, it would seem that the resistance would be greater ; and indeed the water flowing in laterally with a double&nbsp;velocity produces a quadruple non-pressure. But, on the&nbsp;other hand, the pressure at a small depth may be insufficient for preventing a void, while that below effectually&nbsp;prevents it ; and tllis was observed in some experiments of&nbsp;Borda. The effect, therefore, of greater immersion, or of&nbsp;greater compression, in an elastic fluid, does not follow a&nbsp;precise ratio of the pressure, but depends partly on absolute quantities. It cannot therefore be stated by any very&nbsp;simple formula what increase or diminution of resistance&nbsp;wi</span><span class="font1">ll </span><span class="font0">result from a greater depth ; and it is chiefly on this&nbsp;account that experiments made with models of ships and&nbsp;mills are not conclusive with respect to the performance of&nbsp;a large machine of the same proportions, without corrections sometimes pretty intricate. We assert, however, with&nbsp;great confidence, that this is of all methods the most exact,&nbsp;and infinitely more certain than anything that can be deduced from the most elaborate calculation from theory. If</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the resistances at all depths be equal, the proportionality of the total resistance to the body is exact, and perfectly conformable to observation. It is only in great velocities where&nbsp;the depth has any material influence, and the influence is&nbsp;not near so considerable as we should, at first sight, suppose ; for, in estimating the effect of immersion, which has&nbsp;a relation to the difference of pressure, we must always take&nbsp;in the pressure of the atmosphere ; and thus the pressure&nbsp;at thirty-three feet deep is not thirty-three times the pressure&nbsp;at one foot deep, but only double, or twice as great. The&nbsp;atmospheric pressure is omitted only when the resisted plane&nbsp;is at the very surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b.</span><span class="font1"> B. B.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For an account of the experiments of Coulomb, Hutton, and Vince, the reader is referred to Hydrodynamics, chapter iii. (vol. xii. p. 76). We may also refer to a very extensive and valuable series of experiments made in the years&nbsp;1796-1798, by the late Colonel Beaufoy, in the Greenland&nbsp;Docks at Deptford, the details of which have been recently&nbsp;published in a large and sumptuous quarto volume,@@<sup>1</sup> by his&nbsp;son, Henry Beaufoy, Esq., and munificently distributed&nbsp;among scientific institutions and individuals. The following are the principal results :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the velocity to which the resistance is&nbsp;proportional is a little above the duplicate ratio or square of&nbsp;the velocity when the velocity is two miles per hour ; but&nbsp;the ratio gradually decreases as the velocity increases, and&nbsp;becomes a little less than the duplicate ratio at the velocity&nbsp;of eight miles per hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the velocity of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">plus</span><span class="font0"> pressure, or&nbsp;pressure on the head end of the body, is a little above the&nbsp;duplicate ratio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the velocity of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">minus</span><span class="font0"> pressure, or&nbsp;pressure on the stern end, is in general less than the dupli-cate ratio, and diminishes as the velocity increases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cube is less resisted than a square iron plate equal&nbsp;in dimensions with the side of the cube ; and a cylinder less&nbsp;than a round plane of which the area is equal to the end of&nbsp;the cylinder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resistance of a cylinder one foot in length, and&nbsp;the area of the section = 1 square foot, with a semi-globe&nbsp;at each end, when moving with a velocity of eight miles&nbsp;per hour, was 46-29 lbs. avoirdupois ; and the resistance of a&nbsp;globe of the same radius, moving at the same velocity, was&nbsp;64<sup>-</sup>87 ; whence the resistance on the globe was diminished&nbsp;by the interposition of the cylinder, nearly in the ratio of&nbsp;7 to 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general result, it was found that bodies whose&nbsp;head ends are formed of curve surfaces were less resisted&nbsp;than bodies of the same dimensions formed of plane surfaces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resistance is a minimum when the greatest&nbsp;breadth of the body is at the distance of about two fifths&nbsp;of the length from tile head end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar bodies appear to be more resisted immediately&nbsp;under the surface than at the depth of six feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (vol. xiv. part i.), there is a paper by Mr Russel, containing&nbsp;an account of a series of experiments on the resistances of&nbsp;canal boats, made by him in the years 1834 and 1835, which&nbsp;bring to light some phenomena not previously observed,&nbsp;relative to the resistances on bodies partly immersed and&nbsp;moving in narrow channels, and are important on account&nbsp;of their practical bearing on canal navigation. Thc principal phenomena developed by the experiments were the following :1.st, That the resistance does not follow the ratio&nbsp;of the squares of the velocities, excepting when the velocity&nbsp;is small, and the depth of the fluid considerable ; 2</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0">, that</span></p>
