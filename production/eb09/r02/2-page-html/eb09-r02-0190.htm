<p><span class="font0">891. From the end of the 13th century it was the ordinary custom to choose the pope from the bishops ; and from 1592 to 1775 only three were elected who had not&nbsp;been bishops previously. Clement XIV., Pius V., and&nbsp;Gregory XVI. were simple priests when elected to the&nbsp;papacy. The cardinals, to whom the election of the pontiff&nbsp;is reserved, generally select one of their own body for this&nbsp;important position. The privilege of consecrating the&nbsp;pope is reserved to the cardinal bishop of Ostia. From&nbsp;the moment of election the pope may perform all acts&nbsp;appertaining to his jurisdiction, such as granting indulgences, issuing censures, giving dispensations, canonizing&nbsp;saints, instituting bishops, creating cardinals, and suchlike.&nbsp;The powers inherent in the priesthood and episcopate,&nbsp;such as the remission of sins, the administration of the&nbsp;sacraments of confirmation, holy orders, &lt;fec., he cannot&nbsp;exercise unless he be ordained and consecrated. Hence&nbsp;the office of sovereign pontiff is a dignity not of order but&nbsp;of jurisdiction. His pronouncements are regarded as infallible when he defines a doctrine regarding faith and&nbsp;morals to be held by the whole church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The office of pope is elective (see Conclave), and lasts during the life of the occupant, although he may renounce&nbsp;his dignity. When the election has taken place the fact&nbsp;is made known by the cardinal dean. Many ceremonies&nbsp;follow, such as coronation and taking possession of the&nbsp;cathedral church of Rome, St John Lateran. This latter&nbsp;ceremony is not strictly necessary, for after his coronation&nbsp;the pope enjoys the papal power in all its plenitude ; but&nbsp;its object is his enthronization as bishop of the city and&nbsp;diocese of Rome and patriarch of the West. The cardinals&nbsp;are the princes and senators of the church, counsellors of&nbsp;the pontiff, co-operators with him, and vicars in the functions of the pontificate (see Cardinal). To Pope Evaris-tus, fifth successor of St Peter, is attributed the creation&nbsp;of the first </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">titles</span><span class="font0"> or parishes of Rome, the occupants of&nbsp;which were afterwards known as cardinals. At the beginning of the 3d century twenty-five of these titles existed.&nbsp;In the course of time they were increased to fifty and afterwards to seventy. In the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gerarchia Cattolica</span><span class="font0"> the titles are&nbsp;thus divided : suburban sees (cardinal bishops), 6 ; titular&nbsp;churches (cardinal priests), 52 ; and diaconates (cardinal&nbsp;deacons), 16 ; making a total of 7 4. The cardinalate, in&nbsp;the sense at present attached to it, is different from what&nbsp;it was in earlier ages, being now the highest dignity after&nbsp;the papacy. The greater part of the administration of the&nbsp;church—the chief subject of this article—is directed by&nbsp;the cardinals who are members of congregations, which&nbsp;correspond, in a certain measure, to the political ministries&nbsp;in modern states. These congregations are established in&nbsp;Rome by the sovereign pontiff, and their objects are to&nbsp;inquire into, discuss, and decide the important affairs of&nbsp;the whole church and of the temporal dominions of the&nbsp;holy see. The cardinals are assisted by consultors or&nbsp;prelates, by distinguished ecclesiastics secular and regular,&nbsp;and by other officials appointed by the pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The head of every congregation is a cardinal prefect, though some congregations have the pope as prefect, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the holy office, the apostolic visit, and the consistory.&nbsp;The secretary is ordinarily a prelate ; in the holy office&nbsp;he is a cardinal. The acts, decrees, rescripts, and letters&nbsp;issued in the name of a congregation are subscribed generally by the prefect, and always by the secretary. These&nbsp;two officials chiefly regulate the affairs of the congregation&nbsp;and submit to the pope, at periodical audiences, the matters&nbsp;which require his approval. The following are the more&nbsp;important congregations : — inquisition, consistorial, apostolic visit, bishops and regulars, council, residence of&nbsp;bishops, state of regulars, ecclesiastical immunities, propaganda fide, propaganda fide for Oriental affairs, commission&nbsp;for correction of books of the Oriental Church, index,&nbsp;sacred rites, ceremonial, regular discipline, indulgences and&nbsp;relics, examination of bishops, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fabbrica</span><span class="font0"> of St Peter’s, extraordinary ecclesiastical affairs and studies. The congregation of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Holy Roman Inquisition</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Holy Office</span><span class="font0"> (see Inquisition) occupies the first place in regard to the quality&nbsp;of the matters of which it treats, as well as from its antiquity. Its object is the extirpation of heresies. It was&nbsp;formally established by Innocent III. (1198-1216), on the&nbsp;suggestion of St Dominic. The following class of cases&nbsp;falls within its judgment :—crimes of heresy and heretical&nbsp;blasphemy, simultaneous polygamy, robbery of the sacred&nbsp;particles accompanied by insult offered to the same, solicitations </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ad turpia</span><span class="font0"> with abuse of sacramental confession,&nbsp;affected sanctity, contempt of sacred images, divination&nbsp;and sorcery, retention and reading of heretical books, &amp;c.&nbsp;This congregation also proceeds against any one who,&nbsp;having been baptized, returns to paganism ; against any&nbsp;one who celebrates mass or hears confessions, not being a&nbsp;priest ; against false witnesses who depose in causes of&nbsp;faith, &lt;fcc. Its authority extends, in matters of faith, over&nbsp;every person of whatsoever grade, condition, or dignity,&nbsp;whether bishops, magistrates, or communities, and no local&nbsp;or personal privilege exempts from its jurisdiction.&nbsp;Bishops, according to the council of Trent, being subject&nbsp;to the pope only, the Inquisition may institute inquiries,&nbsp;but may not pronounce sentence, this being reserved to&nbsp;the pontiff. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Consistorial,</span><span class="font0"> instituted by Sixtus V., 1587,&nbsp;considers and judges on matters appertaining to the erection of new metropolitan or cathedral churches, or their&nbsp;limits ; instances of bishops who desire to resign their&nbsp;churches ; matters relating to chapters and the confirmation or exclusion of subjects elected by them to metropolitan, episcopal, or monastic dignities ; the examination&nbsp;of coadjutors ; presentations or nominations of bishops&nbsp;made by sovereign princes and republics ; concession of&nbsp;rights to the pallium ; retention of dignities and major&nbsp;benefices incompatible with episcopal rights, and suchlike.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Apostolic Visit</span><span class="font0"> insists on the observance of that decree&nbsp;of the council of Trent which enjoins, as a duty, that&nbsp;every bishop shall visit in person or by means of a delegate the churches, pious institutions, &lt;fcc., in his diocese.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bishops and Regulars</span><span class="font0"> : this congregation has to do chiefly&nbsp;with the government of monasteries and with complaints&nbsp;from the inmates of these against bishops. It examines&nbsp;new institutions and their constitution ; the founding of&nbsp;new monasteries for both sexes, and the removal of subjects from one monastery to another ; questions regarding&nbsp;the alienation of the ecclesiastical property of regulars ;&nbsp;differences between ordinaries, parish priests, and regulars ;&nbsp;and a variety of questions of a similar nature. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Council</span><span class="font0"> : the fathers of the council of Trent, anticipating&nbsp;that doubts might arise concerning the interpretation of&nbsp;the doctrines and decrees published therein, besought&nbsp;Pius IV. to provide in the most fitting manner for such&nbsp;contingencies. This the pontiff did in approving and&nbsp;solemnly confirming the- council in the bull </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Benedictus&nbsp;Deus</span><span class="font0"> (1563), interdicting, under severe penalties, any&nbsp;person whatsoever, secular or ecclesiastic, from publishing&nbsp;commentaries, glosses, &amp;c., or any interpretation whatsoever, upon the decrees of the council of Trent, it being&nbsp;enacted that all controversies, questions, and doubts&nbsp;should be submitted to the congregation of the council.&nbsp;The object of this congregation, therefore, is the interpretation of these doctrines and decrees. The congregation&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Residence of Bishops</span><span class="font0"> may be considered as auxiliary to&nbsp;that of the council. It treats of the questions which concern the bishops’ obligation to reside in their own dioceses,&nbsp;—-a most important matter treated of in the council of&nbsp;Trent.
