<p><span class="font3">practice to apply six wheels at least to all ordinary locomotive stock. The earliest four-wheeled locomotive constructed by Robert Stephenson and Co. as an article of regular manufacture weighed 9 tons in working order.&nbsp;The six-wheeled engines which followed weighed 11J tons.&nbsp;In the course of business locomotives of greater power&nbsp;and greater weight were constructed ; and there are locomotives of the present time which weigh 47</span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font3"> tons in&nbsp;working order, and with the tender full of water and&nbsp;coal about 80 tons gross. There are other engines of&nbsp;special design with twelve wheels which weigh in working&nbsp;order, with fuel and water, 72 tons. The contrast is&nbsp;emphasized in the history of the old Garnkirk and Glasgow&nbsp;Railway, which was opened about the year 1829. The&nbsp;first engines of that line weighed from 8 to 9 tons. They&nbsp;had steam-cylinders 11 inches in diameter, and 4-feet wheels&nbsp;of cast-iron, with a working pressure in the boiler of 50 lb&nbsp;per square inch. The “ Garnkirk ” engine used to take a&nbsp;train of three carriages, together weighing 7 tons gross, at&nbsp;the average speed of 16 miles per hour between Glasgow&nbsp;and Gartsherrie. When the old line, 8 miles in length,&nbsp;was merged in the Caledonian Railway, now comprising a&nbsp;system of nearly 1000 miles in length, the power of the&nbsp;engines was greatly increased, and at this day (1885) there&nbsp;are express passenger engines working over the same ground&nbsp;having large cylinders of 17 or 18 inches in diameter, and&nbsp;wheels of 7 and 8 feet in diameter, weighing from 35 to&nbsp;45 tons. These engines, with steam of 120 R&gt; pressure&nbsp;per square inch, take a gross load of 90 tons at a speed of&nbsp;from 40 to 50 miles per hour.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Length of Railways in the United Kingdom.—</span><span class="font2">The length of railways open for traffic at the end of the year 1854, twenty-five years after the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, was&nbsp;8053 miles (of which nearly one-fourth was single line of way), costing about £35,500 per mile. In 1874 that mileage was doubled&nbsp;(16,449 miles, nearly one-half being only single line), costing&nbsp;about £37,000 per mile. According to the latest published return&nbsp;the length of railways open for traffic at the end of 1883 amounted&nbsp;to 18,681 miles, and the proportion of single line had decreased,&nbsp;being under 46 per cent. Whilst the mileage open was increased&nbsp;at the rate of 420 miles a year during the earlier period (1854-74),&nbsp;it was only increased by 248 miles a year during the later period&nbsp;(1874-83). But many miles of way in multiple have been laid for&nbsp;the working of traffic concentrated on main lines,—127 miles of&nbsp;triple line and 285 of quadruple. The largest share of multiple&nbsp;way belongs to the London and North-Western Railway Company,&nbsp;which owns 28 miles of triple way and no less than 114 of quadruple. The principal section of this railway, 80 miles in length,&nbsp;between London and Rugby, is entirely in quadruple,—two lines&nbsp;for goods and two for passenger traffic. Table I. shows the distribution of the 18,681 miles of railway open at the end of 1883 :—</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border:solid;">

<p><span class="font2">In 1857 the ordinary stock was 57 per cent., as against 37’4 per cent, in 1883 ; and the guaranteed and preferential stock together&nbsp;were but one-third of the ordinary share capital, while in 1883 they&nbsp;equalled it. The English railway system, so far as capital is concerned, has become adjusted to the rule of having rather less than&nbsp;40 per cent, of the capital in “open stock.” In 1845-46 the dividends of railways appear to have reached a maximum. The precipitate influx of new lines during the four years from 1846 to&nbsp;1850, contests before parliament, competition in various forms, and&nbsp;other causes then came in to depress dividends, and reduced the&nbsp;average proportion of net receipts in 1849 to 2<sup>,</sup>83 per cent, of the&nbsp;total capital and loans raised at that time. In 1857 the percentage&nbsp;of net receipts had risen again to 4’06 per cent, of the total capital&nbsp;and loans ; and notwithstanding the accumulation of preference&nbsp;capital and loans, both taking precedence of ordinary capital, the&nbsp;available dividend on the latter increased from 1<sup>,</sup>88 per cent, to&nbsp;3'6 per cent. Since that time the average dividend paid on&nbsp;ordinary capital has maintained its level at least, and it amounted&nbsp;for 1883 to 4'68 per cent. The average cost per mile open at the&nbsp;end of 1883, calculated on the amount of capital raised, with that&nbsp;for 1857 added for comparison, was as follows (Table II.) :—</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font2">The marked increase in capital expenditure per mile is due to permanent improvements, station accommodation, reconstruction, and multiplication of lines. Of the great cost of English railways, independently of the permanent improvements already noticed, part&nbsp;lias been incurred in parliamentary warfare, while much of it is&nbsp;due to great and costly termini, and to the character of the earlier&nbsp;works of construction in England, where great expenditure was&nbsp;incurred for the sake of securing long levels and very easy gradients, until Joseph Locke made a new departure, and constructed&nbsp;the Grand Junction Railway on economic principles by following&nbsp;in great part the contour of the surface. For this line and the&nbsp;London and Birmingham line, for which Robert Stephenson was&nbsp;the engineer, Acts were passed in the same year (1833). The latter&nbsp;line was expensively laid out with tunnels, viaducts, and heavy&nbsp;cuttings and embankments, and cost in round numbers £53,600&nbsp;per mile, as against £23,200 per mile for Locke’s line. The cheaper&nbsp;line abounded in inclines of from 1 in 85 to 1 in 265, whilst the more&nbsp;expensive line was ruled by gradients not steeper than 1 in 330.&nbsp;Locke reckoned upon the sufficiency of the engine-power to take&nbsp;the trains up the inclines, and the famous Crewe engine was the&nbsp;outgrowth of the situation. The London and South-Western Railway, which cost £26,800 per mile, was laid out by Locke to a&nbsp;ruling gradient of 1 in 250. There are other instances of economical construction by the same engineer in the original Caledonian&nbsp;and Scottish Central Railways—now amalgamated—the former of&nbsp;which was made with long gradients of 1 in 75, 1 in 80, 1 in 100,&nbsp;and other steep slopes. Besides these there are other cheaply&nbsp;made railways in Scotland ; but there is only one Scottish railway&nbsp;of the monumental class,—the Edinburgh and Glasgow, nearly&nbsp;dead level, with enormously expensive works. On the Metropolitan Railway system, 22 miles in length, upwards of £11,000,000&nbsp;have been paid up, or about £500,000 per mile. The enormous&nbsp;cost of this line, as well as of the Metropolitan District system&nbsp;(18 miles long, costing £374,000 per mile) and the North London&nbsp;system (12 miles long, costing £325,000 per mile), is sufficiently&nbsp;explained by the place and conditions. The original London and&nbsp;Blackwall Railway, built, like the North London, for the most&nbsp;part on arches, cost £311,912 per mile. The original Birkenhead,&nbsp;Cheshire, and Lancashire Junction Railway, now vested in the&nbsp;neighbouring railway companies, cost upwards of £75,000 per mile,&nbsp;owing partly to the protracted contests in which it had been&nbsp;involved with the neighbouring railways, and partly to the costly&nbsp;works of construction joining the railway to the docks at Birkenhead.
