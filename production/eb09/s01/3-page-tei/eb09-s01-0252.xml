            <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Modern Icelandic</hi> is generally dated from the introduction
                of the Reformation into Iceland; the book first printed, the New Testament of 1540,
                may be considered as the earliest Modern Icelandic document. Although, on account of
                the exceedingly conservative tendency of Icelandic orthography, the language of
                Modern Icelandic literature still seems to be almost identical with the language of
                the 17th century, it has in reality undergone a constant and active development,
                and, phonetically regarded, has changed considerably. Indeed, energetic efforts to
                bring about an orthography more in accordance with phonetics were made during the
                years 1835-47 by the magazine entitled <hi rend="italic">Fjölnir,</hi> where we find
                such authors as Jonas Hallgrimsson and Konr. Gíslason ; but these attempts proved
                abortive. Of more remarkable etymological changes in Modern Icelandic we may note
                the following :—already about the year 1550 the passive termination <hi
                    rend="italic">-zt (-zst)</hi> passes into the till then very rare termination
                    <hi rend="italic">-st</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic">kallast,</hi> to be called);
                    <hi rend="italic">y, y,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ey</hi> at the beginning of
                the 17th century coincided with <hi rend="italic">i, í, </hi>and <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi>; the long vowels <hi rend="italic">d, w,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >ó</hi> have passed into the diphthongs <hi rend="italic">au</hi> (at least
                about 1650), <hi rend="italic">ai</hi> (about 1700), <hi rend="italic">ou</hi> (as
                    <hi rend="italic">mál, </hi>language, <hi rend="italic">mœla,</hi> to speak, <hi
                    rend="italic">stóll,</hi> chair); <hi rend="italic">g</hi> before <hi
                    rend="italic">i, j</hi> is changed into <hi rend="italic">dj</hi> (after a
                consonant) or <hi rend="italic">j</hi> (after a vowel),—<hi rend="italic">e.g.,
                    liggia, </hi>to lie, <hi rend="italic">eigi,</hi> not; in certain other cases
                    <hi rend="italic">g</hi> has passed into <hi rend="italic">gw</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">w,—e.g., lágur,</hi> low, <hi rend="italic">ljúga,</hi> to lie;
                initial <hi rend="italic">g</hi> before <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is silent,—<hi
                    rend="italic">e.g., (g)naga,</hi> to gnaw; has passed into <hi rend="italic"
                    >hn,— e.g., knútr,</hi> knot; <hi rend="italic">ps, pt</hi> into <hi
                    rend="italic">fs, ft; bb, dd, gg</hi> are pronounced as <hi rend="italic">bp,
                    dt, gk,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ll, rl, nn, rn</hi> now in most positions
                (not, however, before <hi rend="italic">d, t,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> and
                in abbreviated names) as <hi rend="italic">dtl, dtn,— </hi>as <hi rend="italic"
                    >j'jail,</hi> mountain, <hi rend="italic">bjöm,</hi> bear; <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> before <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is now pronounced as <hi rend="italic"
                    >bp,— </hi>as <hi rend="italic">hrafn,</hi> raven, &amp;c. Both in vocabulary
                and syntax we find early, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the lawbook <hi
                    rend="italic">Jönsbök,</hi> printed in 1578(-80), Danish exercis- ing an
                important influence, as might be expected from political circumstances. In the 18th
                century, however, we meet with purist tendencies. As one of the leading men of this
                century may be mentioned the poet Eggert Ólafsson (+1768), whose poems were not
                printed till 1832. Worthy of mention in the history of Modern Icelandic language are
                the learned societies which appeared in the same century, of which the first, under
                the name of “ Hið osynilega,” was established in 1760. At this time archaic
                tendencies, going back to the Old Icelandic of the 13th and 14th centuries, were
                continually gaining ground. In our century the following have won especial renown in
                Icelandic literature:— Bjarne Porarensen (+1841), Iceland’s greatest lyric poet, and
                Jonas Hallgrimsson (+ 1845), perhaps its most prominent prose-author in modern
                times.@@5</p>
            <p>The dialectical differences in Modern Icelandic are comparatively trifling and
                chiefly phonetic. The Westland dialect has, for example, preserved the old Icelandic
                long <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> while the other dialects have changed it to the
                diphthong <hi rend="italic">au</hi>; in the Northland dialect initial <hi
                    rend="italic">kn</hi> is preserved, in the others changed into <hi rend="italic"
                    >hn</hi> ; in the northern and western parts of the island old Icelandic <hi
                    rend="italic">hv </hi>appears as <hi rend="italic">kv,</hi> in a part of
                south-eastern Iceland as <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> in the other dialects as <hi
                    rend="italic">xw,—e.g., hvelpr,</hi> whelp. As a matter of curiosity it may be
                noted that on the western and eastern coasts traces are found of a French-Icelandic
                language, which arose from the long sojourn of French fishermen there.</p>
            <p>Owing to the exclusive interest taken in the ancient language, but little attention
                is given even now to the grammatical treatment of Modern Icelandic. Some notices of
                the language of the 17th century may be obtained from the above-mentioned grammar of
                Runolphus Jonas (1651), and for the language of the 18th from Rask’s grammatical
                works. For the language of our own time there is hardly anything to refer to but N.
                Friöriks- son’s works, <hi rend="italic">Islenzk mdlmyndalfjsing,</hi> 1861, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Skyring hinna almennu malfroeðislegu hugmynda,</hi> 1864, which,
                however, are not especially devoted to the modern state of philology; compare also
                B. Magnusson Ölsen’s valuable paper “Zur neuisländischen Grammatik” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Germania,</hi> xxvii., 1882).<hi rend="superscript">@@6</hi> A
                dictionary of merit was that of Björn Halldorsen (+1794), edited in 1814 by Rask.
                Cleasby-Vigfusson’s dictionary mentioned above also pays some attention to the
                modern language. A really convenient Modern Icelandic dictionary is still wanting,
                the desideratum being only partly supplied by K. Gíslason’s excellent
                Danish-Icelandic <hi rend="italic">Dönsk orðabök med tslenzkum pyðingum,</hi>

            <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Norwegian or Norse.</hi>—The <hi rend="italic">Old
                    Norwegian</hi> language (till the Reformation) was not, like the modern
                language, confined to Norway and the Faroes, but was, as already stated, for some
                time</p>
            <p>spoken in parts of Ireland and the north of Scotland, the Isle of Man, the Hebrides,
                Shetland, and Orkney (in the last two groups of islands it continued to survive down
                to modern times), and also in certain parts of western Sweden as at present defined
                (Boliuslan, Sarna in Dalarna, Jamtland, and Harjedalen).</p>
            <p>Our knowledge of it is due only in a small measure to runic inscriptions, @@<hi
                    rend="superscript">7</hi> for these are comparatively few in number (a little
                more than one hundred) and of trifling importance from a philological point of view,
                especially as they almost wholly belong to the period between 1050 and 1350, @@<hi
                    rend="superscript">8</hi> and consequently are contemporary with or at least not
                much earlier than the earliest literature. The whole literature preserved is written
                in the Latin alphabet. The earliest manuscripts are not much later than the oldest
                Old Icelandic ones, and of the greatest interest. On the whole, however, the
                earliest Norwegian literature is in quality as well as in quantity incomparably
                inferior to the Icelandic. It amounts merely to about a score of different works,
                and of these but few are of any literary value. A small fragment (Cod. AM. 655, 4to,
                Fragm. ix., A, <hi rend="smallcaps">b, c),</hi> a collection of legends, no doubt
                written a little before 1200, is regarded as the earliest extant manuscript. From
                the very beginning of the 13th century we have the <hi rend="italic">Norwegian Book
                    of Homilies</hi> (Cod. AM. 619, 4to) and several fragments of law-books (the
                older <hi rend="italic">Gulapingslaw</hi> and the older <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eiðsivakingslaw).</hi> The chief manuscript (Cod. AM. 243B., fol.) of the
                principal work in Old Norwegian literature, the <hi rend="italic">Speculum
                    Regale,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Konungsskuggtfa,</hi> (“Mirror for Kings”), is
                a little later. Of still later manuscripts the so-called legendary <hi rend="italic"
                    >Olafssaga</hi> (Cod. Delag. 8, fol.), from about 1250, deserves mention. The
                masses of charters which—occurring throughout the whole Middle Age of Norway @@<hi
                    rend="superscript">9</hi> from the beginning of the 13th century—afford much
                information, especially concerning the dialectical differences of the language, are
                likewise of great philological importance.</p>
            <p>As in Old Icelandic so in old Norwegian we do not find the most primitive forms in
                the oldest MSS. that have come down to us; for that purpose we must recur to
                somewhat (later ones, containing old poems from times as remote as the days of Brage
                Boddason (the beginning of the 8th century) and pjoðolfr of Hvin (end of the same
                century). It has already been stated that the language at this epoch differed so
                little from other Scandinavian dialects that it could scarcely yet be called by a
                distinctive name, and also that, as Icelandic separated itself from the Norwegian
                mother-tongue (about 900), the difference between the two languages was at first
                infinitely small—as far, of course, as the literary language is concerned. From the
                13th century, however, they exhibit more marked differences ; for, while Icelandic
                develops to a great extent independently, Norwegian, owing to geographical and
                political circumstances, is considerably influenced by the Eastern Scandinavian
                languages. The most important differences between Icelandic and Norwegian at the
                epoch of the oldest MSS. (about 1200) have already been noted. The tendency in
                Norwegian to retain the use of the so-called u-Umlaut has already been mentioned. On
                the other hand, there appears in Norwegian in the 13th century another kind of
                vowel-assimilation, almost unknown to Icelandic, the vowel in terminations being in
                some degree influenced by the vowel of the preceding syllable. Thus, for instance,
                we find in some manuscripts (as the above-mentioned legendary <hi rend="italic"
                    >Olafssaga)</hi> that the vowels <hi rend="italic">e, o</hi> and long <hi
                    rend="italic">a, se,</hi> 0 are followed in terminations by <hi rend="italic">e,
                    o ; i, u, y,</hi> and short <hi rend="italic">a, se,</hi> 0, on the other hand,
                by <hi rend="italic">i, u,—</hi>as in <hi rend="italic">b finer,</hi> prayers, <hi
                    rend="italic">konor,</hi> women ; but <hi rend="italic">tiðir,</hi> times, <hi
                    rend="italic">tungur,</hi> tongues. The same fact occurs in certain old Swedish
                manuscripts. When Norway had been united later with Sweden under one crown (1319) we
                meet pure Suecisms in the Norwegian literary language. In addition to this, the 14th
                century exhibits several differences from the old language @@<hi rend="superscript"

                Norway being united with Denmark, and at intervals also with Sweden, a great many
                Danisms and a few Suecisms are imported into the language. As Suecisms we may
