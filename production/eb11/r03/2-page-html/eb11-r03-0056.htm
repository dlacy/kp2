<p><span class="font0">outside the borders of civilization. From documents which were first produced in 1902 it appears that from 1883 to 1889&nbsp;Rimbaud was in close relations with the Ras Makonnen and with&nbsp;Menelek, then only king of Shoa. At the death of the Negus&nbsp;John, in 1888, he was concerned in the formation of the empire&nbsp;of Ethiopia. From this time Rimbaud had a palace in the town&nbsp;of Harrar, and intrigued with the French government in favour&nbsp;of Menelek and against Italy. Meanwhile, in 1886, believing&nbsp;Rimbaud to be dead, Verlaine had published his poems, under&nbsp;the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Les Illuminations,</span><span class="font0"> and they had created a great&nbsp;sensation in Paris. In this collection appeared the sonnet on the&nbsp;vowels, attributing a different colour to each: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A noir, E blanc,&nbsp;I rouge, U vert, O bleu Voyelles&quot;</span><span class="font0"> But the author, in his Abyssinian&nbsp;hut of palm-leaves, was, and remained, quite unconscious of the&nbsp;fact. In March 1891 a tumour in his knee obliged Rimbaud to&nbsp;leave Harrar and go to Europe for surgical advice. He reached&nbsp;Marseilles, but the case was hopeless; the leg had to be amputated,&nbsp;and Rimbaud died there in hospital on the 10th of Novemher&nbsp;1891. The poems of Rimbaud all belong to his earliest youth.&nbsp;Their violent originality, the influence which they have exercised&nbsp;upon younger writers, the tumultuous existence of their author,&nbsp;and the strange veil of mystery which still hangs over his&nbsp;character and adventures, have given to Rimbaud a remarkable&nbsp;fascination. His life has been written by M. Paterae Berrichon&nbsp;(1897), and valuable reminiscences by his sister, Mile Isabella&nbsp;Rimbaud. His </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Œuvres</span><span class="font0"> were collected in 1898 by MM. Berrichon&nbsp;and Delahaye, and in 1901 his statue was unveiled at Charleville.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RIME ROYAL, the name given to a strophe or stanza-form, which is of Italian extraction, but is almost exclusively identified with English poetry from the fourteenth to the early&nbsp;seventeenth centuries. It appears to be formed out of the&nbsp;stanza called Ottava rima </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(q.v.</span><span class="font0"> by the omission of the fifth&nbsp;line, which reduces it to seven Enes of three rhymes, arranged&nbsp;ababbcc. It was earliest employed with skill, if not, as seems&nbsp;probable, invented, by Chaucer, who composed his long romantic&nbsp;poem of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">TroUus and Cressida</span><span class="font0"> in rime royal, of which the following&nbsp;is an example:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ And as the new-abashéd nightingale,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thet Stinteth first when she beginneth sing,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When that she heareth any herde tale,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Or in the hedges any wight stirring,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And, after, siker doth her voice out-ring,—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Right so Cresseyda, when her dredë stint,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Opened her heart, and told all her intent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The “ Prioress Tale,” in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Canterbury Tales,</span><span class="font0"> offers another particularly beautiful proof of Chaucer’s skill in the use of the&nbsp;rime royal. In the fifteenth century this stanza was habitually&nbsp;used, in preference to heroic verse, by Hoccleve and Lydgate,&nbsp;and, with more melody and grace, by the unknown writer of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Flower and the Leaf,</span><span class="font0"> In the sixteenth century, rime royal&nbsp;was chosen by Hawes as the vehicle of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pastime of Pleasure&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1506) and by Barclay in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ship of Fools</span><span class="font0"> (1509); it was now&nbsp;regarded as the almost exclusive classical form for heroic poetry&nbsp;in England, and it had long been so accepted in Scotland,&nbsp;where </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The King’s Quair</span><span class="font0"> of King James I., the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fables</span><span class="font0"> of Henry-son and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Thistle and the Rose</span><span class="font0"> of Dunbar had closely followed&nbsp;Chaucer’s pattern. The greater part of that huge poetic miscellany, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Mirror for Magistrates</span><span class="font0"> (1559-1610), was written&nbsp;in rime royal, Sackville’s momentous </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Induction</span><span class="font0"> among the&nbsp;rest. The seven-line stanza began to go out of fashion with&nbsp;the revival of Elizabethan poetry, but we find it still used in&nbsp;Spenser’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hymn of Heavenly Beauty,</span><span class="font0"> Shakespeare’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lucrece</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Orchestra</span><span class="font0"> of Sir John Davys. After the first decade of the&nbsp;seventeenth century rime royal went out of fashion. Since then&nbsp;it has been occasionally revived, but not in poems of great&nbsp;length or particular importance. Rime royal should always&nbsp;be written in iambic metre, and be formed of seven Enes of equal&nbsp;length, each containing ten syllables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIMINI, a town and bishop’s see of Italy, in the province of Forli, Emila, on the Adriatic coast, 69 m. S.E. of Bologna&nbsp;by rail. Pop. (1901) town, 18,022; commune, 46,801. The&nbsp;city is bounded on three sides by water. It faces the Adriatic&nbsp;to the north, has the torrent Aprusa, now called Ausa, on the&nbsp;east and the river Marecchia on the west. It stands n a&nbsp;fertile plain, which on the southern side soon swells into pleasant&nbsp;slopes backed by the jagged peaks of the Umbrian Apennines.&nbsp;The foremost foothill of the range is the steep crag of Mons&nbsp;Titanus, crowned by the towers of the repubEc of San Marino.&nbsp;Rimini attracts numerous visitors for the sea-bathing at Porta&nbsp;Marina. It has mineral springs, and the industries comprise&nbsp;fisheries, ironworks and foundries, sulphur furnaces, silk-mills, rope walks, match factories, brickworks, flourmills and&nbsp;furniture. Its main interest, however, is historical. Apart&nbsp;from the ancient buildings, &amp;c., referred to below, </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">Rimini&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">can boast of a good pubEc library, founded by the jurist Gam-balunza in 1617, a municipal picture galery, an archaeological&nbsp;museum, a technical school (1882) and a bronze statue of&nbsp;Pope Paul V. The ancient castle of Sigismondo Malatçsta,&nbsp;now dilapidated, has in recent years been used as a prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History.—</span><span class="font0">Rimini is the ancient Ariminum </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.</span><span class="font0"> for its early history and remains). During the middle ages the history&nbsp;of Rimini has no importance. Alternately captured by Byzantines and Goths, it was rigorously besieged by the latter in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font0"> 538. They were, however, compeled to retreat before the&nbsp;reinforcements sent by Belisarius and Narses; thus the Byzantines, after various vicissitudes, became masters of the town,&nbsp;appointed a duke as its governor, and included it in the exarchate&nbsp;of Ravenna. It afterwards feU into the power of the Longo-bards, and then of the Franks, who yielded it to the pope, for&nbsp;whom it was governed by counts to the end of the 10th century.&nbsp;Soon after this period the imperial power became do minant, in&nbsp;Rimini. In 1157 Frederick I. gave it, by imperial patent, the&nbsp;privilege of coining money and the right of self-government;&nbsp;and in the T3th century we find Rimini an independent commune waging war on the neighbouring cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the year 1216, Rimini, being worsted by Cesena, adopted the desperate plan of granting citizenship to two members&nbsp;of the powerful Malatesta tribe, Giovanni and Malatesta, for&nbsp;the sake of their aid and that of their vassals in the defence&nbsp;of the state and the conduct of the war. This family quickly&nbsp;struck root in the town and gave birth to future tyrants; for&nbsp;in 1237 Giovanni was named podestà, and this office was the&nbsp;first step towards the sovereign power afterwards assumed by&nbsp;his descendants. Meanwhile, Rimini was tom by the feuds of&nbsp;Guelf and Ghibelline. The latter were the dominant party in&nbsp;the days of Frederick II., although very unpopular on account&nbsp;of the grievous taxes imposed by the empire. Accordingly,&nbsp;the majority of the urban nobles joined the Guelfsand were&nbsp;driven into exile. But before long, as the Swabian power&nbsp;decEned in Italy, the GueJf party was again predominant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Then followed a long period of confusion, in which, by means of conspiracies and crimes of every kind, the Malatesta succeeded&nbsp;in becoming masters and tyrants of Rimini. Giovanni Malatesta&nbsp;had died in 1247 and been succeeded by his son Malatesta,&nbsp;born in 1212, and sumamed Malatesta da Verrucchio. This&nbsp;chieftain, who Eved to be a hundred years old, had ample time&nbsp;to mature his ambitious designs, and was the real founder of&nbsp;his house. Seizing the first suitable moment, he placed himselfat the head of the exiled Guelfs, and restored them to Rimini.&nbsp;Then, as the empire acquired fresh strength in Italy, he quietly&nbsp;bided his time and, on the descent of the Angevins, again&nbsp;assumed the leadership of the GueKs who now had the upper&nbsp;hand for a long time. Being repeatedly elected podestà for&nbsp;lengthy terms of office, he at last became the virtual master&nbsp;of Rimini. Nor was he checked by Rome. Pope Boniface VIII.&nbsp;was fully aware of the rights and traditional pretensions of the&nbsp;Holy See, but preferred to keep on good terms with one who had&nbsp;so largely contributed to the triumph of the Guelfsin Romagna.&nbsp;Accordingly he not only left Malatesta unmolested, but in&nbsp;1299 conferred on him fresh honours and estates, so that</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
