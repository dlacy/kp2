<p><span class="font0">and Gusman d'Alfarache, with some of which it is highly probable that he was acquainted through translations ; or&nbsp;whether his strong vulgar likenesses of seafaring personages,&nbsp;half privateer, half mariner, and his fondness for the delineation of equivocal characters of all kinds, arose from his&nbsp;familiarity with the one class, through his residence at Lime-house, and his acquaintance with Dampier,—and with the&nbsp;other, from his long and frequent imprisonments;—it is certain that though he had no intention of favouring immorality,&nbsp;he yet enters upon the delineation of personages, and scenes&nbsp;of roguery, low profligacy and vice, with a degree of curiosity&nbsp;and complacency, and dwells upon them with a fondness&nbsp;and minuteness of detail, altogether uncommon, and not a&nbsp;little unaccountable in a person who in his opinions savoured of the puritan. This strange labour of love, and study&nbsp;of the morbid anatomy of society, has resulted in a series of&nbsp;night pieces from the haunts of crime, which, though sombre&nbsp;and gloomy in a high degree, and little suited to a cultivated&nbsp;taste, nay, indeed, frequently producing on the mind the painful effect of a real chapter from the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Newgate Calendar,</span><span class="font0"> yet&nbsp;display the most wonderful invention and keeping in all their&nbsp;parts, and a coherence and dexterity of adaptation to each&nbsp;other, which render the ordinary testsby which we endeavour&nbsp;to discriminate a fictitious from a real narrative, inadequate&nbsp;or altogether inapplicable to these singular compositions of&nbsp;Defoe. Whatever might be the motive of his humility of&nbsp;choice, Defoe, like many of his favourite heroes, was perfectly contented to take up his abode in the back settlements of fiction, and was most at home in that Alsatia of Romance, the purlieus of which, by common consent, his more&nbsp;ambitious predecessors had sedulously avoided, as discreditable or dangerous. The transition from their refined&nbsp;Orondates’ and Statiras<sup>,</sup>, to the society of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Captain Jack&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Moll Flanders</span><span class="font0"> of Defoe, is, to use a phrase of Sterne,&nbsp;like turning from Alexander the Great to Alexander the coppersmith. In his novels, we rarely meet with any thing more&nbsp;exalted or respectable, than masters of trading vessels, dealers in small wares, supercargoes, or, it may be, pickpockets,&nbsp;pirates, candidates for the plantations, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">emeriti</span><span class="font0"> who have&nbsp;already obtained that distinction. In the foreground, we&nbsp;have the cabin, the night cellar, the haunts of fraud, or the&nbsp;round-house; in the distance, Newgate, or Execution Dock.&nbsp;There can be but one opinion, however, as to the wonderful&nbsp;air of veracity, resembling that of a deposition upon oath,&nbsp;which Defoe has imparted to his fictitious creations, and&nbsp;which his genius effects, mainly by accumulation of details,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">non vi sed sœpe cadendo;</span><span class="font0"> often even by the introduction of a&nbsp;multitude of irrelevant particulars and repetitions, just as&nbsp;in the conversation of uneducated persons in real life. Accordingly the result, as a simulacrum of reality, is one of&nbsp;magical deception. Lord Chatham, it is well known, took&nbsp;his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs of a Cavalier</span><span class="font0"> for a real history ; Dr, Mead believed his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of the Plague</span><span class="font0"> to be the work of a medical man, and his impudent but most plausible history of the&nbsp;apparition of Mrs. Veal, being received by many sober-minded persons as an actual apocalypse from the spiritual world,&nbsp;was the means, as is well known, of disposing of an unsaleable edition of Drelincourt upon death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But notwithstanding this peculiar power of stamping the impression of reality upon the coinage of his imagination,&nbsp;which, to say the truth, was seldom of the finest metals, it&nbsp;may be safely affirmed, that but for his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Robinson Crusoe,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Defoe would scarcely now be remembered as a writer of&nbsp;fiction. The charm of that work, the first part of which appeared in 1719, is, that it emancipates us from those low&nbsp;haunts and questionable society with which his other novels&nbsp;make us acquainted. We escape from the fumes of tobacco and strong waters, to breathe a purer air on that lone&nbsp;island placed far amidst the melancholy main, where he has&nbsp;imprisoned his shipwrecked mariner; and whileDefoe⅛ unrivalled power of inventing a series of j robable minutiæ, both&nbsp;in the way of reflexion and incident, enables him to conduct with consummate skill, what we may call the self-education of Crusoe in his solitude,—the process by which he&nbsp;adapts himself to his situation, and the gradual triumphs&nbsp;which, by his ingenuity and patience, he obtains over the&nbsp;difficulties and privations by which he is surrounded, till he&nbsp;changes desolation into comfort ;—the imagination of tbe&nbsp;writer is visibly raised beyond its usual grovelling level&nbsp;by the romance of the situation which he describes. His&nbsp;genius imbibes the spirit of the place ; it imparts to the&nbsp;cave of the sailor, something of the seclusion and purity of&nbsp;a hermitage ; till the simple train of reflections which he&nbsp;puts into the mouth of his uneducated mariner, upon the&nbsp;sublimity and awfidness of solitude, impress the mind more&nbsp;than the most eloquent declamation. It is a fine proof&nbsp;how completely Defoe has succeeded in interesting us for&nbsp;the solitary being to whom he has given a poetical life, and&nbsp;attuned the mind of his readers to that sentiment of silence&nbsp;and unbroken repose which is breathed over the scene of&nbsp;his imprisonment,—“ where all the air a solemn stillness&nbsp;holds,”—that after a time the least incident which threatens&nbsp;to disturb the security of the cave, or the solitude of the&nbsp;island, assumes importance in our eyes, and the groan of an&nbsp;old goat expiring in a cave, or the print of a man’s foot in&nbsp;the sand, awaken a feeling of suspense and anxiety which&nbsp;many a writer has in vain laboured to excite by a prodigal&nbsp;expenditure of the machinery of terror.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Robinson Crusoe</span><span class="font0"> may be considered in a great measure as a fortunate accident, and that its main charm arises from the more poetical and refined character which the nature of the story and its locality almost necessarily impressed upon it, is indeed evident from the visible inferiority of&nbsp;the second part, where the seclusion of the scene is broken&nbsp;in upon, and Defoe peoples the island with his usual retinue&nbsp;of planters and ship’s captains ; a production which scarcely&nbsp;rises above the level of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Captain Singleton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The application of tlle sameprincipleofproducingeffect by minuteness of detail rather than by grasp, or the selection&nbsp;of a few marking traits, is visible in our next great novelist,&nbsp;Richardson (1689-1761,) but the principle is applied in a&nbsp;different and higher way. Defoe was satisfied with weaving&nbsp;chains of probable incidents, which might be fitted to any&nbsp;character, or at least any character of a given class, such&nbsp;as a mariner or a merchant, a planter or a pickpocket. He&nbsp;did not care, at all events he did not labour, to individualize character. Crusoe, his most finished portrait, is&nbsp;still only the average representative of all shipwrecked mariners ; his reflections and his struggles, embody the hopes,&nbsp;fears, and efforts, of all men left to maintain a solitary warfare with difficulties. So bis Captain Jack, bom a gentleman and bred a pickpocket, has nothing to separate him&nbsp;from other </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">enfans perdus</span><span class="font0"> of the same class. But Richardson aspired to the creation rather of probable character than&nbsp;probable incident ; and to this he applied the same system&nbsp;of accumulating minute traits of words, thoughts, and actions, and reiterating small touches, and minute lights and&nbsp;shadings, which Defoe had done to the creation of masses&nbsp;of coherent and plausible events. In the latter department,&nbsp;indeed, he is probably neither remarkable for success nor&nbsp;failure. Occasionally, and particularly in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sir Charles&nbsp;Grandisοn,</span><span class="font0"> he outrages both patience and probability in no&nbsp;inconsiderable degree ; and so little progress does the narrative make, that as Johnson remarked to Erskine, “ Were&nbsp;you to read Richardson for the story, your impatience would&nbsp;he so fretted, you would go hang yourself.” But even in&nbsp;the most successful portion of his plots, there is no chance&nbsp;of our mistaking fiction for fact ; the artist does not disappear behind his creations as in the case of Defoe. The&nbsp;very form, too, in which his novels are cast, that of a series&nbsp;of correspondence, however favourable to the display of&nbsp;traits of character, and minute dissection of sentiment, is</span></p>
