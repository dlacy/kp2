<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Private Collections.—</span><span class="font0">The publications of the Historical Manuscripts Commission are in most cases the only printed means&nbsp;of reference to private muniments. The 17th Report of the&nbsp;Commission contains an index to all the collections of papers so&nbsp;far dealt with by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Wills.—</span><span class="font0">Up to the date of the Probate Act (20 &amp; 21 Vict. c. 77) the proving of wills was under ecclesiastical jurisdiction,&nbsp;and the wills themselves were scattered among peculiar courts—&nbsp;courts of the various bishops, and the prerogative court of Canterbury. By the passing of the act a general registry was established&nbsp;at Somerset House, to which were transferred all the wills of the&nbsp;prerogative court of Canterbury and of many of the other registries.&nbsp;But even at the present time there remains much confusion and&nbsp;uncertainty as to the place of deposit of the wills of any particular&nbsp;court; and for accurate information on this point the inquirer&nbsp;must be referred to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Handbook to the Ancient Courts of Probate&nbsp;and Depositories of Wills,</span><span class="font0"> by G. W. Marshall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">British Colonies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For the British colonies the most important records, historically speaking, are the Colonial Office papers deposited in the Public&nbsp;Record Office, London; and those colonies which have published&nbsp;the records relating to their history have usually gone to that&nbsp;source. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New South Wales,</span><span class="font0"> however, there is in the Colonial&nbsp;Secretary’s office at Sydney a collection of records dating from&nbsp;1789, which are included in the volumes published by that State.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cape Colony</span><span class="font0"> possesses records dating from 1652; G. McCall Theab&nbsp;historiographer of the colony, has also published important&nbsp;series of volumes of documents drawn from the Public Record&nbsp;Office and other European sources. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Canada</span><span class="font0"> has recently centralized its records, of which a large part so far consists of&nbsp;transcripts made in Europe. For an account see E. C. Burnett’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">List of printed guides to and descriptions of Archives and other&nbsp;repositories of Historical Manuscripts</span><span class="font0"> (American Historical Manu-scripts Commission Report, 1897). The Dominion Archivist submits&nbsp;yearly to the Minister for Agriculture a report, in which (in&nbsp;Appendices) are given many lists and accounts of records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">European Countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In dealing with Great Britain it has seemed desirable to give some account of publications dealing with the contents of the&nbsp;repositories described. In the remainder of the article this will&nbsp;not be attempted. For the most part the books mentioned are&nbsp;in themselves bibliographies and guides, and do not contain even&nbsp;abstracts or descriptions of actual documents. It is scarcely&nbsp;necessary to explain that much of the following information is&nbsp;based on the work of Langlois and Stein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Austria and Hungary.—The records of Austria-Hungary, Bohemia, and the other states under the same government, are&nbsp;still preserved locally. There are repositories of government&nbsp;records at Vienna, Budapest and Prague, and ten provincial&nbsp;places of deposit. Even at Vienna there is nothing resembling&nbsp;the English Public Record Office; the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kaiserliches und königliches&nbsp;Haus-, Hof- und Staatsarchiv</span><span class="font0"> contains the papers </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font0">the imperial&nbsp;family and the records of imperial administration and of that of&nbsp;foreign affairs. Of other departmental papers those at the&nbsp;Ministry of War are the most important. There is no complete&nbsp;inventory of all these records. At Budapest since 1875 have been&nbsp;collected the archives </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font0">Hungary, Transylvania, Croatia and&nbsp;the government of Fiume: for an account of the records in this&nbsp;and other Hungarian and Transylvanian repositories sec Fr.&nbsp;Zimmermann’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Uber Archiv in Ungarn; ein Führer durch ungar-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ländische und siebenburgische Archive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Belgium.—The records are numerous and valuable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">State Records</span><span class="font0"> comprise all those of the central governments, of the modern kingdom, of the governments preceding it and of&nbsp;the various . states such as Brabant, Flanders, Gueldres and&nbsp;Hainault out of which Belgium was formed. They are preserved&nbsp;partly at Brussels as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">General Records of the Kingdom</span><span class="font0"> and partly&nbsp;in provincial repositories. Thus at Ghent are archives of the&nbsp;county of Flanders, at Liége of the principality of that name and&nbsp;of the duchy of Limburg, at Mons of the county of Hainault, at&nbsp;Bruges of the liberty of Bruges and other jurisdictions of eastern&nbsp;Flanders; at Namur, Arlon, Hasselt and Tournai are repositories&nbsp;of less importance: at the same time the repositorv at Brussels&nbsp;contains many records of the same kind as those in the provincial&nbsp;offices and is the chief one of the country; the collection there has&nbsp;been formed from various collections in Belgium combined with&nbsp;records restored by the Austrian government and other acquisitions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Archives Provinciales,</span><span class="font0"> the records of provincial administrations since 1794, are placed in the chief towns of each province: each&nbsp;collection falls into three periods, French (1794-1814), Dutch&nbsp;(1814-1830) and Belgian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Municipal Archives.—</span><span class="font0">The most important are those of Antwerp, Bruges, Ghent, Malines, Mons, Tournai and Ypres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The best book of general bibliographical reference for Belgian records is Pirenne’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bibliographie de l'histoire de Belgique.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Denmark.—At Copenhagen there has been, since 1889, a central Record office </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Rigsarchiv)</span><span class="font0"> containing all the previously existing&nbsp;collections of records, and receiving those of the various ministries&nbsp;and offices. There are also repositories there, and at Odense and&nbsp;Viborg, for local records, municipal and others. The central&nbsp;office is publishing a series of inventories of documents in its&nbsp;charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">France.—The best general work is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Les Archives de l'histoire de France,</span><span class="font0"> by Langlois and Stein. The administration of the records&nbsp;is attached to the Ministry of Public Instruction, acting through&nbsp;a commission and inspectors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Archives Nationales,</span><span class="font0"> in the Hôtel Soubise at Paris, are divided into three sections, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Historique, Administrative et Domaniale</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Legislative et Judiciaire,</span><span class="font0"> each including subsections distinguished&nbsp;by letters or groups of letters. The classification is by subject,&nbsp;not necessarily by origin or function; but some of the classes,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font0"> the archives of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Trésor des Chartes,</span><span class="font0"> the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Parliament of Paris&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Châtelet,</span><span class="font0"> represent real groups of records with a common&nbsp;history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Archives des Ministères.—</span><span class="font0">In theory the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Archives Nationales </span><span class="font0">should receive all government office records, except those in&nbsp;current use: actually several offices retain their own. Thus the&nbsp;Ministry of Foreign Affairs keeps its archives, divided into&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Correspondance politique</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mémoires et Documents : </span><span class="font0">it also&nbsp;publishes series of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Inventaires analytiques des Archives du Ministère&nbsp;des Affaires étrangères,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Recueils des instructions données aux&nbsp;ambassadeurs et ministres de France depuis les traités de Westphalie&nbsp;jusqu'à la Révolution française.</span><span class="font0"> The Ministries of War and the&nbsp;Marine likewise possess and administer their own archives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Archives Départementales. —</span><span class="font0"> Each department possesses a special office for the custody of its records, which are in many&nbsp;cases of great importance, consisting partly of the records of the&nbsp;ancient provincial governments, private documents seized at the&nbsp;Revolution, muniments of religious houses, &amp;c., and partly of&nbsp;modern administrative records. A system of uniform classification&nbsp;by subjects has been applied to these, coupled with a rule that&nbsp;documents having a common history and origin are not to be&nbsp;separated; it is understood that the intelligence of the archivists&nbsp;in charge has enabled them to disobey neither of these regulations.&nbsp;For a general view of the arrangement and contents of departmental repositories see </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">État général par fonds des archives&nbsp;départementales, ancien régime et période révolutionnaire</span><span class="font0"> (1903),&nbsp;and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Inventaires Sommaires</span><span class="font0"> for the several departments. For&nbsp;the publication of local societies see </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Manuel de bibliographie de&nbsp;l'histoire,</span><span class="font0"> by Ch. V. Langlois, (1901) p. 385 seq.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Archives Municipales et Communales : </span><span class="font0">the value of these arises largely from their having had an undisturbed history:&nbsp;inventories of most of the collections exist in print. (See Langlois&nbsp;and Stein, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">op. cit.</span><span class="font0"> pp. 278-442.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Archives Hospitalières</span><span class="font0"> form an important body of records, for the most part undisturbed. For their classification, and a&nbsp;list of the repositories of them, see Langlois and Stein, p. 443 seq.;&nbsp;the many other places in France where records exist are mentioned in the same work; note, however, that the archives of the&nbsp;Bastille are now in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal</span><span class="font0"> at Paris. There&nbsp;are in the English Public Record Office seventy-three volumes of&nbsp;transcripts from French archives, taken partly from the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Archives&nbsp;Nationales</span><span class="font0"> (Letters of Henrietta Maria, &amp;c.) and partly from&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Archives Départementales. </span><span class="font0">The Record Office </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Calendar of Documents&nbsp;France,</span><span class="font0"> edited by J. H. Round, containing early monastic charters,&nbsp;is based on these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Germany.—Unfortunately lists of German State archives </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Geheimes Archiv)</span><span class="font0"> are not published. Repositories are very&nbsp;numerous: for their localities, sec the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hand- und Addressbuch&nbsp;der deutschen Archive</span><span class="font0"> of C. A. H. Burkhardt (2nd ed., 1887).&nbsp;In Prussia, besides the central repository at Berlin, there are&nbsp;sixteen provincial ones of importance. The other kingdoms and&nbsp;states forming part of the German empire have each their repository,&nbsp;not always at the capital. Some account of their contents will be&nbsp;found in Langlois and Stein </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(op. cit.)</span><span class="font0"> and in Fr. νon Löher's&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Archivlehre. Grundzüge der Geschichte, Aufgaben und Einrichtung&nbsp;unserer Archive</span><span class="font0"> : for the publication of State Records see Dahl-mann-Waïtz, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Quellenkunde zur deutschen Geschichte;</span><span class="font0"> and for&nbsp;Prussian archives in particular R. Koser's </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Über den gegenwärtigen&nbsp;Stand der archivalischen Forschung in Preussen</span><span class="font0"> (1900). For the&nbsp;numerous «and valuable records of German towns reference may be&nbsp;made to the works already mentioned. Many of the towns, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Cologne, publish volumes drawn from their archives, and even&nbsp;include in them documents from other sources. Of special interest&nbsp;to English students is Konstantin Höhlbaum's work upon the&nbsp;Hanse towns. The Record Office has a volume of transcripts&nbsp;from German archives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Holland.—There is one repository for each of the eleven states. That at the Hague, for south Holland, serves also as a central&nbsp;repository for the whole kingdom. This collection occupies a&nbsp;special building, and includes the records of Foreign Affairs,&nbsp;classed under the countries to which they relate, and certain&nbsp;documents acquired from the collection of Sir Thomas Phillips.&nbsp;There are many printed and manuscript lists, and access to the&nbsp;documents is easy. This is also the case with the other provincial&nbsp;archives, of which the most important are those at Arnheim.</span></p>
