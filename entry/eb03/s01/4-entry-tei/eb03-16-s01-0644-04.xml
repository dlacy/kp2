a moſt ingenious and learned phyſician, was a profeſſor in the univerſity of Padua, in the beginning of the 17th century. He contrived a kind of ſtatical chair, by means of which, after eſtimating the aliments received, and the ſeuſible diſcharges, he was enabled to determine with great exactneſs the quantity of inſenſible perſpiration, as well as what kind of victuals and drink increaſed or diminiſhed it. On theſe experiments he erected a curious ſyſtem, which he publiſhed under the title of <hi rend="italic">De medicina ſtatica;</hi> of which we have an Engliſh tranſlation by Dr Quincy. Sanctorius publiſhed ſeveral other treatiſes, which ſhewed great abilities and learning.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
