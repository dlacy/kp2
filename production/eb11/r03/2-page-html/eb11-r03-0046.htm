<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Match or Target Rifle.—</span><span class="font1">The sport or pastime of target shooting has many times changed its character, owing to the steady&nbsp;improvement in the rifle and the different ranges or distances&nbsp;at which shooting is practised. Range usually governs the&nbsp;construction of the target rifle, long-range rifles not being&nbsp;necessarily the best weapons for a short range of, say, 200 yds.&nbsp;Limitations—such as the amount of powder charge, weight of&nbsp;bullet and rifle—are also usually imposed in order to place all&nbsp;competitors on equal terms. The long-range match rifle is not&nbsp;the superior of the military rifle as a weapon, but as a scientific&nbsp;shooting instrument is the best small-arm produced. The&nbsp;ordinary target rifle is a hybrid arm, combining the points of&nbsp;the long-range match, modern military and best sporting rifles.&nbsp;The miniature match rifle is used for short-range practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Shooting at fixed marks has been practised continuously in Switzerland from medieval times. A club (“ Société de&nbsp;Pharquebuse et de la Navigation ”) has existed in Geneva since&nbsp;1474; and the Zürich “ Schützen-Gesellschaft ” since about the&nbsp;same date. It is not clear at what period rifles were introduced&nbsp;in these clubs. From the beginning of the 19th century up to&nbsp;1844 the rifle generally used in Great Britain had a polygrooved&nbsp;barrel -630 in. in diameter, with spherical ball, and the arm&nbsp;weighed from 11 to 15 lb. It was not fired in military fashion,&nbsp;but had a handle extending downwards fixed in front of the&nbsp;trigger-guard, which was grasped by the left hand, the left arm&nbsp;being steadied against the body. This method of shooting is&nbsp;still sometimes followed by Swiss and German riflemen. Target&nbsp;shooting as a sport or business was rarely practised in Great&nbsp;Britain until after the formation of the Volunteer Force in 1859.&nbsp;The inauguration of the “ National Rifle Association ” in i860&nbsp;opened a new and most important era in the history and development of the rifle. This institution was established “ for the encouragement of rifle corps and the promotion of rifle shooting&nbsp;throughout Great Britain. ... As a national pastime to make&nbsp;the rifle what the bow was in the days of the Plantagenets, the&nbsp;familiar weapon of those who stand forth in the defence of their&nbsp;country,” The first meeting of the N.R.A. was held at Wimbledon&nbsp;in i860. The first shot was fired by Queen Victoria@@<sup>1</sup> from a&nbsp;Whitworth rifle on a machine rest, at 400 yds., and struck&nbsp;the bull’s-eye. The Whitworth muzzle-loading rifle won many&nbsp;of the important prizes at this and subsequent meetings prior&nbsp;to 1871. Its most important features, arrived at after exhaustive&nbsp;experiments, were a smaller bore of 450 in., with a twist of&nbsp;rifling of one turn in 20 in., and an elongated mechanically&nbsp;fitting projectile. Long-range rifle construction is also largely&nbsp;indebted to Whitworth for the highly accurate and superior&nbsp;tools and processes introduced by him in this branch of manufacture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1866 and after, Metford’s system of hardened expanding bullets and shallow rifling gradually superseded the mechanically&nbsp;fitting system of Whitworth, and the Whitworth rifle gradually&nbsp;lost its position. In 1861, the Henry grooving for a cylindrical&nbsp;bullet, a modification of the Whitworth, first appeared. In&nbsp;1864, Rigby, with a five-grooved rifle and a mechanically fitting&nbsp;bullet, tied with the Whitworth rifle in the preliminary rifle&nbsp;trial of the N.R.A. at 1000 yds., and in a subsequent trial took&nbsp;the first place. By 1871 the Whitworth rifle bad given place&nbsp;to the Metford system with hardened cylindrical bullets, shallow&nbsp;rifling and increasing spiral. In 1867 the modern breech-loading rifle with a metallic, cartridge was first introduced.&nbsp;The Metford system of rifling greatly assisted its development.&nbsp;In this year Rigby also produced a new model long-range rifle&nbsp;designed on the lines followed by Metford. In 1869 the Henry&nbsp;barrel came to the front. In 1870 the Martini-Henry, the new&nbsp;service arm, won the duke of Cambridge’s prize, the extreme&nbsp;range in this competition being 800 yds. In 1871 the Snider&nbsp;breech-loader replaced the Enfield muzzle-loader, and the&nbsp;Martini-Henry replaced the Whitworth in the later stages-—800,&nbsp;900 and 1000 yds.—of the Queen’s prize. The Metford barrel&nbsp;was also used in breech-loaders, and the duke of Cambridge’s&nbsp;prize—for the first time fired at 1000 yds.—fell to it. During&nbsp;the twenty-three years from 1871 to 1894 the Metford military&nbsp;match rifle only four times failed to win this prize, while it&nbsp;took a preponderating share of other prizes. The years 1872&nbsp;and 1873 marked a decided advance in the military breechloader, though for fine shooting the muzzle-loader still seemed&nbsp;hard to equal. In 1875 a team of American riflemen first visited&nbsp;Wimbledon with “ army-pattern ” breech-loading rifles, which&nbsp;were cleaned out after every shot, and met with considerable&nbsp;success. A feature of their shooting was the “ back position,”&nbsp;then a novelty. In 1877 the superiority of the cleansable and&nbsp;cleansed breech-loader over the increased fouling of the muzzle-loader was clearly demonstrated, though the muzzle-loader did&nbsp;not at once disappear. In 1878 the highest scores ever made&nbsp;with the muzzle-loader in Great Britain were recorded, greater&nbsp;care in cleaning the rifle after every shot being observed.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup>The “Queen's” or &quot; King’s ” prize is the highest distinction to which a rifle shot can attain. The competition is one of three&nbsp;stages, the first and second eliminating all but the best 100 competitors. The bronze medal of the N.R.A. is awarded to the&nbsp;highest scorer in the first stage, the silver medal to the leader in&nbsp;the second, and the King’s prize and N.R.A. gold medal to the&nbsp;winner in the last stage: 71 shots in all are fired at distances up&nbsp;to 1000 yds., and the winners’ scores of late years have been&nbsp;320 to 325 out of a possible 355. Only the service rifle is allowed.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">In 1883 the N.R.A. Council altered the conditions, wiping out after every shot was forbidden, but muzzle-loaders were not&nbsp;disqualified. The result was that the American type of rifle&nbsp;disappeared. The poor shooting of the Martini at 1000 yds.&nbsp;induced the Council to take the retrograde step of reducing the&nbsp;maximum range for the Queen’s prize to 900 yds. In 1890 the&nbsp;N.R.A. first met at the new ranges at Bisley. This year was&nbsp;noticeable for the excellent shooting made in the “ any ” rifle&nbsp;competitions by the Gibbs-Metford match rifle, particularly at&nbsp;1000 yds. range. The accepted type was 461 calibre; 7 grooves&nbsp;0045 in. in depth; 80 grains of special black gunpowder, and a&nbsp;bullet of 570 grains. In 1892 and 1893 the Lee-Metford 303&nbsp;rifle with cordite ammunition was first used by the army teams.&nbsp;In 1890 and later the Hon. T. F. Fremantle, Captain Gibbs and&nbsp;some others used Metford’s copper-coated bullets in the Gibbs-Metford rifle with success. In 1895 many match rifle shots&nbsp;followed their example. In 1895 and 1896 the -303 was equalled,&nbsp;and in some instances beaten, by the smaller-calibre Mannlicher&nbsp;rifle. This was partly due to faulty Lee-Metford ammunition.&nbsp;The 303 now proved its superiority to the -450 Martini, especially at the longer ranges. The Bisley meeting of 1896 practically&nbsp;closed the series of contests with both the Martini and the&nbsp;military match rifles. The Volunteers were thenceforth armed&nbsp;with the -303.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The results of the Bisley meetings since 1895 have proved that rifles of the -303 class, the British -303 rifle particularly, are not&nbsp;so good for match rifles pure and simple as the larger bores using&nbsp;black powder. The light bullets are more subject to deflection&nbsp;by the wind at long ranges than the heavier speed-retaining&nbsp;bullets of the larger bores. No nitro-powder used appears to&nbsp;have equalled the black powder in regularity of shooting. At&nbsp;the same time the object of the N.R.A. competitions is to&nbsp;encourage the use of the military service rifle in the first place,&nbsp;and in the case of the “ any ” rifle competitions to encourage&nbsp;the production of weapons of the highest efficiency for military&nbsp;purposes. Acting on these principles the rifles allowed by the&nbsp;N.R.A. regulations (1907) are classed as follows:—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Class I.—&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Service rifle (S.R.): government pattern 303 magazine rifles;</span></p>
