He&nbsp;was also elected in 1887 president of the Society of Biblical&nbsp;Archaeology, to whose </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Proceedings</span><span class="font2"> he was a constant contributor. The most important of his contributions to Egyptology&nbsp;are his Hibbert Lectures on “ The Religion of the Egyptians,”&nbsp;delivered in 1879; and the translation of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Book of the Dead,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">with an ample commentary, published in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Transactions</span><span class="font2"> of the&nbsp;society over which he presided. He retired from the Museum&nbsp;under the superannuation rule in 1891, and died in London on&nbsp;the 14th of October 1897. He had been knighted the year&nbsp;before his death. He married in 1857 Ludovica von Brentano,&nbsp;member of a well-known German Uterary family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RENOUVIER, CHARLES BERNARD (1815-1903), French philosopher, was born at Montpellier on the 1st of January 1818,&nbsp;and educated in Paris at the École Polytechnique. In early&nbsp;life he took an interest in poUtics, and the approval extended by&nbsp;Hippolyte Carnot to his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Manuel républicain de Fhomme et du&nbsp;citoyen</span><span class="font2"> (1848) was the occasion of that minister’s fall. He&nbsp;never held public employment, but spent his life writing, retired&nbsp;from the w<sup>r</sup>orld. He died on the ist of September 1903. Ren-ouvier was the first Frenchman after Malebranche to formulate&nbsp;â complete idealistic system, and had a vast influence on the&nbsp;development of French thought. His system is based on Kant’s,&nbsp;as his chosen term “ Néo-criticisme ” indicates; but it is a transformation rather than a continuation of Kantianism. The two&nbsp;leading ideas are a dislike to the Unknowable in aU its forms,&nbsp;and a reliance on the validity of our personal experience. The&nbsp;former accounts for his acceptance of Kant’s phenomenalism,&nbsp;combined with rejection of the thing in itself. It accounts, too,&nbsp;for his polemic on the one hand against a Substantial Soul, a&nbsp;Buddhistic Absolute, an Infinite Spiritual Substance; on the&nbsp;other hand against the no less mysterious material or dynamic&nbsp;substratum by which naturalistic Monism explains the world.&nbsp;He holds that nothing exists except .presentations, which are&nbsp;not merely sensational, and have an objective aspect no less&nbsp;than a subjective. To explain the formal organization of&nbsp;our experience he adopts a modified version of the Kantian&nbsp;categories. The insistence on the validity of personal experience&nbsp;leads Renouvier to a yet more important divergence from Kant&nbsp;in his treatment of volition. Liberty, he says, in a much wider&nbsp;sense than Kant, is man’s fundamental characteristic. Human&nbsp;freedom acts in the phenomenal, not in an imaginary noümenal&nbsp;sphere. Belief is not intellectual merely, but is determined by&nbsp;an act of will affirming what we hold to be morally good. In&nbsp;his religious views Renouvier makes a considerable approximation to Leibnitz. He holds that we are rationally justified in&nbsp;affirming human immörtality and the existence of a finite God&nbsp;who is to be a constitutional ruler, but not a despot, over the&nbsp;souls of men. He would, however, regard atheism as preferable&nbsp;to a belief in an infinite Deity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RENSSELAER, a city of Rensselaer county, New York, U.S.A., in the eastern part of the state, on the E. bank of the&nbsp;Hudson river, opposite Albany. Pop. (1900) 7466, of whom&nbsp;1089 were foreign-born; (1910 census) 10,711. It is served&nbsp;by the New York Central and the Boston &amp; Albany railways, which have shops here, and is connected with Albany&nbsp;by three bridges across the Hudson. Rensselaer, originally&nbsp;called Greenbush, was first settled in 1631, and the site formed&nbsp;part of the large tract bought from the Indians by the agents&nbsp;of KiUian van Rensselaer and known as RensseIaerwyck. In&nbsp;1810 a square mile of land within the present city limits was&nbsp;acquired by a land speculator, was divided into lots and offered&nbsp;for sale. Development followed, and five years later the village&nbsp;was incorporated. In 1897 Greenbush was chartered as a&nbsp;city, and its name was changed to Rensselaer. Its limits were&nbsp;extended in 1902 by the annexation of the viUage of Bath&nbsp;(pop. in 1900, 2504) and the western part of the township of&nbsp;East Greenbush. Rensselaer manufactures knit-goods, wool&nbsp;shoddy, felt, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RENT. Various species of rent appear in Roman Law: rent </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(canon)</span><span class="font2"> under the long leasehold tenure of Emphyteusis; rent&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(reditus)</span><span class="font2"> of a farm; ground-rent </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(solarium)*,</span><span class="font2"> rent of state&nbsp;lands </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(vectigal) ; </span><span class="font2">and the annual rent </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(prensio)</span><span class="font2"> payable&nbsp;for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus Superficiarum</span><span class="font2"> or right to the perpetual enjoyment of anything built on the surface of land. (See </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Roman&nbsp;Law.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">English Law. (As</span><span class="font2"> to the rent of apartments, &amp;c., see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lodger and Lodgings.)</span><span class="font2">—Rent is a certain and periodical&nbsp;payment or service made or rendered by the tenant of a corporeal&nbsp;hereditament and issuing out of (the property of) such hereditament. Its characteristics, therefore, are (1) certainty in amount;&nbsp;(2) periodicity in payment or rendering; (3) the fact that rent&nbsp;is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">yielded</span><span class="font2"> and is, therefore, said “ to lie in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">render,”</span><span class="font2"> as distinguished&nbsp;from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">profits d prendre</span><span class="font2"> in general, which are taken, and are,&nbsp;therefore, said to lie in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">prendre;</span><span class="font2"> (4) that it must issue out of&nbsp;(the profits of) a corporeal hereditament. A rent cannot be&nbsp;reserved out of incorporeal hereditaments such as advowsons&nbsp;(Co. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lilt.</span><span class="font2"> 47a, 142a). But rent may be reserved out of estates&nbsp;in reversion or remainder (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Real Property)</span><span class="font2"> which are not&nbsp;purely incorporeal. It is not essential that rent should consist&nbsp;in a payment of money. Apart from the rendering of services,&nbsp;the delivery of hens, horses, wheat, &amp;c., may constitute a rent.&nbsp;But, at the present day, rent is generally a sum of money paid&nbsp;for the occupation of land. It is important to notice that this&nbsp;conception of rent was attained at a comparatively late period&nbsp;in the history of the law. The earliest rent seems to have been&nbsp;a form of personal service, generally labour on land, and was&nbsp;fixed by custom. The exaction of a competition or rack rent&nbsp;beyond that limit ed by custom was, if one may judge from the old&nbsp;Brehon law of Ireland, due to the presence upon the land of&nbsp;strangers in blood, probably at first outcasts from some other&nbsp;group.@@<sup>1</sup> The strict feudal theory of rent admitted labour on&nbsp;the lord’s land as a lower form, and developed the military&nbsp;service due to the crown or a lord as a higher form. Rent service&nbsp;is the oldest and most dignified kind of existing rent. It is&nbsp;the only one to which the power of distress attaches at common&nbsp;law, giving the landlord a preferential right over other creditors&nbsp;exercisable without the intervention of judicial authority (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Distress).</span><span class="font2"> The increasing importance of socage tenure,&nbsp;arising in part from the convenience of paying a certain amount,&nbsp;whether in money or kind, rather than comparatively uncertain&nbsp;services, led to the gradual evolution of the modern view of&nbsp;rent as a sum due by contract between two independent persons.&nbsp;At the same time the primitive feeling which regarded the&nbsp;position of landlord and tenant from a social rather than a&nbsp;commercial point of view is still of importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rents, as they now exist in England, are divided into two great classes—rent service and rent charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rent Service.—</span><span class="font2">A rent service is so called because by it a tenure by means of service is created between the landlord&nbsp;and the tenant. The service is now represented by fealty, and&nbsp;is nothing more than nominal. Rent service is said to be&nbsp;incident to the reversion—that is, a grant of the reversion carries&nbsp;the rent with it (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Remainder).</span><span class="font2"> A power of distress is incident</span></p>
