<p><span class="font0">It will be seen from these particulars—which are typical of what has happened not only on other British railways, but&nbsp;also on those of other countries—that much more space has&nbsp;to be provided and more weight hauled for each passenger&nbsp;than was formerly the case. Thus, on the Midland railway&nbsp;in 1885, each third-class passenger, supposing the carriage to&nbsp;have its full complement, was allowed 0∙62 ft. of lineal length,&nbsp;and his proportion of the total weight was 5∙7 cwt. Less than&nbsp;20 years later the lineal length allowed each had increased&nbsp;to nearly 1∙4 ft., and the weight to nearly 14 cwt. Passengers&nbsp;in sleeping cars appropriate still more space and weight; in&nbsp;Great Britain some of these cars, though 40 tons in weight&nbsp;and over 65 ft. in length, accommodate only 11 sleepers, each&nbsp;of whom thus occupies nearly 6 ft. of the length and requires&nbsp;over 3½ tons of dead weight to be hauled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In America the long open double-bogie passenger cars, as originally introduced by Ross Winans on the Baltimore &amp;&nbsp;Ohio railway, arc universally in use. They arc distinguished&nbsp;essentially from the British type of carriage by having in the&nbsp;centre of the body a longitudinal passage, about 2 ft. wide,&nbsp;which runs their whole length, and each car having communication with those on either side of it, the conductor, and also&nbsp;vendors of books, papers and cigars, are enabled to pass right&nbsp;through the train. The cars are entered by steps at each end, and&nbsp;arc provided with lavatories and a supply of iced water. The&nbsp;length is ordinarily about 50 ft., but sometimes 80 or 90 ft.&nbsp;The seats, holding two persons, are placed transversely on&nbsp;each side of the central passage, and have reversible backs, so&nbsp;that passengers can always sit facing the direction in which&nbsp;the train is travelling. Cars of this saloon type have been&nbsp;introduced into England for use on railways which have adopted&nbsp;electric traction, but owing to the narrower loading gauge of&nbsp;British railways it is not usually possible to scat four persons&nbsp;across the width of the car for its whole length, and at the&nbsp;ends the seats have to be placed along the sides of the vehicle.&nbsp;A considerable amount of standing room is then available,&nbsp;and those who have to occupy it have been nicknamed “ straphangers, ” from the fact that they steady themselves against&nbsp;the motion of the train by the aid of leather straps fixed from&nbsp;the roof for that purpose. Cars built almost entirely of steel,&nbsp;in which the proportion of wood is reduced to a minimum,&nbsp;are used on some electric railways, in order to diminish danger&nbsp;from fire, and the same mode of construction is also being&nbsp;adopted for the rolling stock of steam railways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">End doors opening on end platforms have always been characteristic of American passenger equipment. Their use&nbsp;secures a continuous passage-way through the train,&nbsp;but is attended with some discomfort and risk when&nbsp;the train is in motion. The opening of the doors was apt&nbsp;to cause a disagreeable draught through the car in cold weather,&nbsp;and passengers occasionally fell from the open platform, or&nbsp;were blown from it, when the train was moving. To remedy&nbsp;these defects vestibules were introduced, to enclose the platform with a housing so arranged as to be continuous when&nbsp;the cars are made up into trains, and fitted with side doors&nbsp;for ingress and egress when the trains are standing. A second&nbsp;advantage of the vestibule developed in use, for it was found&nbsp;that the lateral swaying of the cars was diminished by the&nbsp;friction between the vestibule frames. The fundamental&nbsp;American vestibule patent, issued to H. H. Sessions of Chicago&nbsp;in November 1887, covered a housing in combination with a&nbsp;vertical metallic plate frame of the general contour of the&nbsp;central passage-way, which projected slightly beyond the line&nbsp;of the couplings and was held out by horizontal springs top&nbsp;and bottom, being connected with the platform housing by&nbsp;flexible connexions at the top and sides and by sliding plates&nbsp;below. A common form is illustrated in fig. 27. Subsequent&nbsp;improvements on the Sessions patent have resulted in a modified&nbsp;form of vestibule in which the housing is made the full width&nbsp;of the platform, though the contact plate and springs and the&nbsp;flexible connexions remain the same as before. The application of vestibules is practically limited to trains making long</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">journeys, as it is an obstruction to the free ingress and egress of passengers on local trains that make frequent stops.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">In the United States the danger of the stoves that used to be employed for heating the interiors of the cars has been&nbsp;realized, and now the most common method is by&nbsp;steam taken from the locomotive boiler and circulated&nbsp;through the train in a line of piping, rendered continuous between the cars by flexible coupling-hose. The&nbsp;same method is finding increased favour in Great Britain,&nbsp;to the supersession of the old hot-water. footwarmers. These&nbsp;in their simplest form are cans filled with water, which is heated&nbsp;by immersing them in a vessel containing boiling water. In&nbsp;some cases, however, they are filled with fused acetate of soda;&nbsp;this salt is solid when cold, but when the can containing it is&nbsp;heated by immersion in hot water it liquefies, and in the process&nbsp;absorbs heat which is given out again on the change of state&nbsp;back to solid. Such cans remain warm longer than those containing only hot water. On electric railways the trains are&nbsp;heated by electric heaters. As to lighting, the oil lamp has&nbsp;been largely displaced by gas and electricity. The former is&nbsp;often a rich oil-gas, stored in steel reservoirs under the coaches&nbsp;at a pressure of six or seven atmospheres, and passed through&nbsp;a reducing valve to the burners; these used to be of the&nbsp;ordinary fish-tail type, but inverted incandescent mantles are&nbsp;coming into increasing use. Gas has the disadvantage that&nbsp;in case of a collision its inflammability may assist any fire that&nbsp;may be started. Electric light is free from this drawback.&nbsp;The current required for it is generated by dynamos driven*&nbsp;from the axles of the coaches. With “set” or “block”&nbsp;trains, that is, trains having their vehicles permanently coupled&nbsp;up, one dynamo may serve for the whole train, but usually&nbsp;a dynamo is provided for each coach, which is then an</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
