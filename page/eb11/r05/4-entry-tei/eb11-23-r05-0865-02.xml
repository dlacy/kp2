<p><label>RUSSELL, WILLIAM CLARK</label>
(1844- ), British author, was</p><p>born at the Carlton House Hotel, New York, on the 24th of February 1844, the son of Henry Russell, author of <hi rend="sup">44</hi> Cheer, Boys, Cheer," and other popular songs. He went to school at Winchester, and then at Boulogne, joining the merchant service at thirteen, and serving for eight years. This apprenticeship to a seafaring life was turned to account in a series of stories which have fascinated two generations of boy readers. <hi rend="italic">John Holdsworth, Chief Mate</hi> (1874), immediately made his reputation. Other successful stories were: <hi rend="italic">The Wreck of the Grosvenor</hi> (1875), which he pleaded for better food for English seamen; <hi rend="italic">The Frozen Pirate</hi> (1877), <hi rend="italic">An Ocean Tragedy</hi> (1881), <hi rend="italic">The Emigrant Ship</hi> (1894), <hi rend="italic">The Ship, Her Story</hi> (1894), <hi rend="italic">The Convict Ship</hi> (1895), <hi rend="italic">What Cheer I</hi> (1895), <hi rend="italic">The Two Captains</hi> (1807), <hi rend="italic">The Romance of a Midshipman</hi> (1898), <hi rend="italic">The Shipâ€™s</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Adventure</hi> (1899), <hi rend="italic">Overdue</hi> (1903), <hi rend="italic">Abandoned</hi> (1904), <hi rend="italic">His Island Princess</hi> (1905). He joined the staff of the <hi rend="italic">Newcastle Daily Chronicle,</hi> and afterwards became a leader writer on the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph,</hi> but the double labour of journalism and novelwriting threatened his health, and he resigned in 1887. Many of the papers which he contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> were collected in volume form in <hi rend="italic">Round the Galley Fire</hi> and other volumes. He also wrote a Life of Lord Collingwood (1891), and, with W. H. Jacques, <hi rend="italic">Nelson and the Naval Supremacy of England</hi> (New York, 1890).-</p>
