<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ſtegc of L </span><span class="font2">andre cies; 15,000 Britiſh and 15,000 Auſtri-ans, commanded by the duke </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">York and general Otto, encamped towards Cambray. The emperor and the&nbsp;prince of Saxe-Cobourg, at the head of 60,000 Auf-trians, were advanced as ſar as Guiſe ; 12,000 Heffi-ans and Auſtrians under general worms were ſtationed near Douay and Bouchain ; Count Kaunitz with&nbsp;15,000 Auſtrians defended the Sambre and the quarter near Maubeuge ; and, laſtly, general Clairfait, with&nbsp;40,000 Auſtrians and Hanoverians, protected Flanders&nbsp;from Tournay to the ſea ; 60,000 Pruffians, for whom&nbsp;a ſubſidy had been paid by Great Britain, were expect-ed in addition to thefe, but they never arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The French now commenced their active operations. On the morning of the 26th of April they attacked&nbsp;the duke of York near Cateau in great force. After&nbsp;a ſevere conflict they were repulſed, and their general&nbsp;Chapuy was taken priſoner. At the ſame time they&nbsp;attacked the troops under his Imperial majeſty, but&nbsp;were there alſo repulſed in a ſimilar manner; loſing in&nbsp;all 57 pieces of cannon. On the ſame day, however,&nbsp;general Pichegru advanced from Liſſe, attacked and&nbsp;defeated general Clairfait, took 32 pieces of cannon;&nbsp;and, in the conrſe of a few days, made himſelf maſter&nbsp;of Warwick, Menin, and Courtray, On the 29th of&nbsp;April, the garrifon of Landrecies ſurrendered to the allies. when this event was known in the convention,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">. it excited a conſiderable degree of alarm. It was, however, the laſt effectual piece of ſucceſs enjoyed by the allies during this diſaſtrous campaign. General Clairfait was again completely defeated by Pichegru in a&nbsp;general engagement ; and it was found neceffary to&nbsp;ſend the duke of York to his affiſtance. This move-ment was no doubt unavoidable ; but the effect of it&nbsp;was, that it ſplit down tlie allied army into a variety&nbsp;of portions, capable of carrying on a defultory war-fare, but unfit ſor the vigorous objects of conqueſt.&nbsp;On tlie 10th the duke of York was attacked near&nbsp;Tournay by a body of tlie enemy, whom he repulſed ;&nbsp;but he was unable to join Clairfaſt, upon whoſe de-ſtruction the French were chiefly bent : for at thc&nbsp;ſame time that the duke of York was occupied by the&nbsp;attack upon himſeff, Pichegru fell upon Clairfait with&nbsp;filch irreſiſtible impetuoſity, that he was compelled to&nbsp;retreat in confuſion, and a part of his army appears to&nbsp;have fled to the neighbourhood of Bruges, while Pichegru was thus advancing ſucceſsſully in weſt Flan-dere, general jourdan advanced in Eaſt Elanders from&nbsp;Maubeuge, croſſed the Sambre, and forced general&nbsp;Kaunitz to retreat. On the 18th, however, general&nbsp;Kaunitz ſucceedfed in repuiſing the enemy in his turn,&nbsp;and they re-croſſed the Sambre with conſiderable loſs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The allies now found that no progreſs could be made in France while general Pichegru was advancing ſuccefs-fully and occupying weft Flanders in their rear. The&nbsp;emperor, therefore, withdrew the greater part of his&nbsp;army to the neighbourhood of Tournay, and reſolved&nbsp;to make a grand effort to cut oſſ the communication&nbsp;between Courtray and Liſle, thus to prevent complete-ly the retreat of Pichegru. On the night of the 16th,&nbsp;the army moved forwards in five columns for this purpoſe. Clairfait was at the ſame time directed, to crofs&nbsp;the Lys, to effect </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">general junction, if poffible, and&nbsp;complete the plan. The attempt during that evening&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Äeemed to </span><span class="font2">promiſe ſucceſs ; but, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">in the courſe of ncxt</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">day, the diviſion under the duke of York </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font2">Over-powered by numbers and defeated. The progreſs of the reſt of the columns was ſtopped, and Clairfaſt&nbsp;completely defeated. In the confuſion of the day,&nbsp;when attempting to rally the different parts of the di-viſion which he commanded, the duke of York was ſeparated from his own troops </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font2">a party of the enemy’s&nbsp;cavalry, and only eſcaped being made priſoner by the&nbsp;ſwiftnefs of his horſe. The plan of the allies being&nbsp;thus fruſtrated, their army withdrew to the neighbour«&nbsp;hood of Tournay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pichegru ſpeedily attempted to retaliate againſt the allies. On the 22d of May he brought down at day&nbsp;break his whole force againſt them. The attack was&nbsp;commenced by a heavy ſire of artillery, and all the ad-vanced poſts were forced. The engagement ſoon became general; the attacks were repeatedly renewed&nbsp;on both ſides ; the whole day was ſpent in a ſucceſ-ſion of obſtinate battles. All that military /kill could&nbsp;do was performed on both ſides. The French and&nbsp;the allied ſoldiers fought with equal courage and&nbsp;equal diſcipline. At nine o’clock in tlie evening the&nbsp;French at laſt reluctantly withdrew from the attack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ί he day on which a vanquiſhed enemy flies from the field is not âlways that on which the victory is won.&nbsp;In this engagement the French were unſucceſsſul in&nbsp;their immediate objects; but the weight of their ſire,&nbsp;their ſteady difcipline, and their violent obſtinacy of&nbsp;attack, raiſed their military character high in the eſti-mation of the officers and ſoldiers of the allied army.&nbsp;It was ſoon perceived, that in addition to theſe they&nbsp;poſſeſſed other advantages. Their numbers were im-menſe ; they implicitly obeyed their generals ; who,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">being men newly raiſed from the rank of ſubalterns, as implicitly ſubmitted to the directions of the com-mitte of public ſafety. A combination of efforts was&nbsp;thus produced whoſe operation vvas not retarded by&nbsp;divided counſels. On the other ſide, the numbers of&nbsp;the allies were daily declining ; them leaders were independent princes or powerful men, whoſe ſentiments&nbsp;and intereſts were often very hoſtile to each other, and&nbsp;their exertions were conſequently diſunited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ou the 24th the French again croſſed the Sambre, but were driven back with much loſs. On the 27th&nbsp;an attempt was made to beſiege Charleroi, but the&nbsp;prince of Orange on the 3d of June compelled them to&nbsp;raiſe the liege. On the 12th a ſimilar attempt was&nbsp;made, and they were again repulſed. In weft Flanders, however, Pichegru was ſufficiently ſlrong to com*&nbsp;mence the liege of Ypres. He was ſoon attacked by&nbsp;general Clairfait for the purpoſe of relieving it, but&nbsp;without ſucceſs.—Ypres was garrifoned by 7000 men ;&nbsp;reinforcements were therefore daily ſent from the grand&nbsp;army to Clairfait for the purpoſe of relieving it. It is&nbsp;unneceſſary to, mention the bloody conteſts ſu which&nbsp;that unfortunate general was daily engaged with thc&nbsp;French ; it is fufficient to ſay, that they were uni-forraly unſucceſsful, and were the means of wafting,&nbsp;in </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">great degree, the armies of the allies. Ypres held&nbsp;out till the 17th of June, when it capitulated: and ſuch&nbsp;was the difcipline of the French army at this time, that&nbsp;no notice could be obtained, for ſeveral days, of that&nbsp;event. In conſequence of it and of other events, the&nbsp;duke of York found it neceffary to retreat to Oude-narde j for Jourdan, after ftorming the Auſtrian camp</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
