                <p><label>ST JUN1EN</label>, a town of west-central France in the department of
                    Haute-Vienne, on the right bank of the Vienne, 26 m. W. by N. of Limoges on the
                    railway from Limoges to AngoulÃªme. Pop. (1906) town, 8484; commune, 11,400. The
                    12th century collegiate church, a fine example of the Romanesque style of
                    Limousin, contains a richly sculptured tomb of St Junien, the hermit of the 6th
                    century from whom the town takes its name. Another interesting building is the
                    Gothic chapel of Notre-Dame, with three naves, rebuilt by Louis XI., standing
                    close to a medieval bridge over the Vienne. The town, which ranks second in the
                    department in population and industry, is noted for leather-dressing and the
                    manufacture of gloves and straw paper.</p>
