ing to registration. It is presided over by an officer named the Registrar-General, appointed under the great seal, under whom in the office is an assistant registrar, a chief clerk, three first clerks, and forty-three others, who are appointed by the Lords of the Treasury, or by the Registrar-General with their approval. Instructions emanate from this office to all the local officers charged with the various duties of registration under this act, namely, superintendent registrars, with their deputies ; registrars of births and deaths, with their deputies; and registrars of marriages ; all of whom act within their respective districts under the directions of the Registrar-General, in whom is vested the power of dismissal.
The duties of the Registrar-General are to make regulations, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, for the management of the General Register Office, and for the duties of all registrars and superintendent registrars ; to appoint superintendent registrars for temporary districts ; to examine and sanction the formation of registrars’ districts, submitted by the various boards of poor-law guardians for his approval; to examine and sanction, if approved, the plans for local register offices, to be provided by the poor-law guardians, and submitted by them for his approval ; to furnish the various books, forms, &c. requisite for registration, to the various parties requiring them ; to register certified places of worship for solemnization of marriage; to decide, in cases of doubt, upon all caveats referred to him by the superintendent registrars, and to adjudicate on an appeal from the superintendent registrar’s decision on a caveat ; to hear and settle all matters of doubt, dispute, and complaint, respecting the business of registration, and the duties and conduct of the various officers employed therein ; to annex extraparochial places to registrars’ districts ; to unite two or more superintendent registrars’ districts, or to divide one superintendent registrar’s district into two, with the approval of the Secretary of State ; to appoint registrars or superintendent registrars if the guardians neglect to do so ; and to send once in every year a report and abstract of all registered births, deaths, and marriages, for the preceding year, to the Secretary of State, to be laid before parliament.
The superintendent registrar is a local officer created by the registration and marriage acts, acting solely within his “ district, which is either identical with a poor-law union, or consists, as in a few instances, of two or more unions formed into one district by the authority of the Registrar-General, or is a temporary district consisting of several temporary registrars’ districts united by the Registrar-General where there is no poor-law board of guardians. In the latter case, the superintendent registrar is appointed by the Registrar-General. Inthe former, he is either the clerk of the guardians, who, as such, is entitled
ex officio
to take the office, or he is some person whom, the clerk not accepting, the guardians may have appointed, subject in either case to such qualifications as the Registrar-General may by any general rule require.
The principal duty of the superintendent registrar is to receive quarterly, from the registrars of births and deaths, and registrars of marriages, within his district, the certified copies of births, deaths, and marriages registered by them for the preceding quarter, and, having verified them by comparison with the original entries in the register-books, to certify their correctness, and transmit them to the Registrar-General ; to receive also and transmit, but not also to verify, certified copies of marriages registered by all clergymen of the Established Church within his district, or by any registering officer of the Quakers, or secretary of a Jewish synagogue, if there be any within or assigned to his district. He has also the care of the register office of his district, where are deposited all register-books within the district when filled ; and he is to make indexes of these, and permit searches, and give copies of entries in the register-books on payment of certain fixed fees. He may appoint registrars of marriage within his district ; and, previous notice having been already given, he may grant certificates for marriage, and, within his district, licenses for marriage, provided such license be not for marriage to be solemnized according to the forms of the Established Church.
The registrar of births and deaths is a local officer acting within his district, which has either been formed, with the
∣
 approval of the Registrar-General, by a board of guardians' established under the poor-law amendment act, or is a temporary district formed by the Poor-law Commissioners where there is no such board established. In the former case, the registrar is appointed by the board of guardians, in the latter by the Poor-law Commissioners, subject, in both cases, to such qualifications as the Registrar-General may by any general rule declare to be necessary.
His duties, which are the same in both cases, are to register, in the books provided for that purpose, every birth and death occurring within his district ; and four times in every year to make, on forms furnished for that purpose, copies of all such entries of births and of deaths for the quarter immediately preceding ; to certify that such copies are correct, and to deliver them to the superintendent registrar of his district, who, on comparing them with the register-book, which tlle registrar must also produce, will certify their correctness, and transmit them to the Registrar-General. He also delivers an account of tlle number of entries so copied, which the superintendent registrar verifies, and sanctions if correct, and which the registrar then presents, and obtains payment of the fees due thereupon from the guardians or overseers of the poor.
The registrar of marriages is a local officer appointed by the superintendent registrar, with the approval of the guardians, or, if there be no board of guardians, of the Poor-law’ Commissioners, and acts solely within his district, which is the same as that of the superintendent registrar by whom he was appointed.
His duty is to be present at marriages not according to the forms of the Church of England, solemnized either in registered places of worship within his district, or in the superintendent registrar’s office ; to register the same in a book provided for that purpose ; and to deliver quarterly to the superintendent registrar certified copies of such registered entries, in like manner as is done by the registrar of births and deaths.
Marriages according to the forms of the Established Church are registered, as before, by the officiating clergyman, who delivers certified copies quarterly to the superintendent registrar of his district, to be transmitted to the Registrar-General. The marriages are also registered at the time
in duplicate ;
and one of the books, when filled, is to be deposited immediately in the superintendent registrar’s office.
Marriages according to the ceremonies of the Quakers and of the Jews are registered respectively in duplicate by the registering officer of the Quakers and the secretary of the synagogue, and certified copies are given quarterly to the superintendent registrar for transmission.
The number of persons by whom the registration of births, deaths, and marriages under the existing law is conducted (exclusive of the central establishment of the General Register Office) is as follows :—
There are 618 superintendent registrars, each of whom may appoint a deputy, with the approval of the Registrar-General, to act for him in case of his illness or absence. Of these, 562 have accepted the office as clerks of boards of guardians, or have been appointed by the guardians ; and fifty-six are temporary, and have been appointed by the Registrar-General.
There are 2193 registrars of births and deaths, each of whom may appoint a deputy, with
tlle
approval of the guardians or of the Poor-law Commissioners. Of these, 1926
