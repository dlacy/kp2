<p><span class="font1">hundred supercommentaries have been written on it. Rashi unites homily with grammatical exegesis in a manner which&nbsp;explains the charm of the commentary. His influence in&nbsp;Christian circles was great, especially because of the use made&nbsp;of the commentary by Nicolaus de Lyra </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.υ.),</span><span class="font1"> who in his turn&nbsp;was one of the main sources of Luther’s version. Even more&nbsp;important was Rashi’s commentary on the Talmud, which&nbsp;became so acknowledged as the definitive interpretation that&nbsp;Rashi is cited simply under the epithet of “ the Commentator.’’&nbsp;It is no exaggeration to assert that the modern world owes its&nbsp;power to understand the Talmud to Rashi. In this field&nbsp;the “ Commentator ’’ is supreme. He practically edited the&nbsp;text of the Talmud besides explaining it, and the Talmud is&nbsp;never printed without Rashi’s commentary on the margin.&nbsp;An important feature of Rashi’s commentaries is the frequency&nbsp;of French translations of words. These glosses </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(lo‛azim</span><span class="font1">) have&nbsp;now been in part edited from the manuscripts of the late Arsène&nbsp;Darmesteter.</span></p>

The Rashtrakuta&nbsp;or Ratta clan are supposed to have held power during the&nbsp;historical blank before the 6th century; but theÿ came to the&nbsp;front in a.d. 750, when Dantidurga overthrew the Chalukya&nbsp;dynasty and made himself ruler of the Deccan. He was&nbsp;succeeded by his uncle Krishna I. (c. 760), who completed his&nbsp;conquests, and whose reign is memorable for the execution of&nbsp;the Kailasa, the rock-cut temple at Ellora. His grandson&nbsp;Govinda III. (780-815) extended the power of the family from&nbsp;the Vindhya Mountains and Malwa on the north to Kanehi on&nbsp;the south. The next king, Amogavarsha, reigned for sixty-two&nbsp;years. The reign of Krishna III. was remarkable for a war&nbsp;with the Cholas, in which the Chola king was killed on the&nbsp;field of battle in 949. The last of the Rashtrakuta kings was&nbsp;Karka II., who was overthrown by the Chalukyas in 973.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RASK, RASMUS CHRISTIAN (1787-1832), Danish scholar and philologist,· was born at Brändekilde in the island of Fünen&nbsp;or Fyen in Denmark in 1787. He studied at the university of&nbsp;Copenhagen, and at once showed remarkable talent for the&nbsp;acquisition of languages. In 1808 he was appointed assistant&nbsp;keeper of the university library, and some years afterwards&nbsp;professor of literary history. In 1811 he published, in Danish,&nbsp;his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Introduction to the Grammar of the Icelandic and other Ancient&nbsp;Northern Languages,</span><span class="font1"> from printed and MS. materials accumulated by his predecessors in the same field of research. The&nbsp;reputation which Rask thus acquired recommended him to&nbsp;the Arna-Magnaean Institution, by which he was employed&nbsp;as editor of the Icelandic </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lexicon</span><span class="font1"> (1814) of Björn Haldorson,&nbsp;which had long remained in manuscript. Rask visited Iceland,&nbsp;where he remained from 1813 to 1815, mastering the language&nbsp;and familiarizing himself with the literature, manners and&nbsp;customs of the natives. To the interest with which they inspired him may probably be attributed the establishment at&nbsp;Copenhagen, early in 1816, of the Icelandic Literary Society,&nbsp;of which he was the first president.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In October 1816 Rask left Denmark on a literary expedition, at the cost of the king, to prosecute inquiries into the languages&nbsp;of the East, and collect manuscripts for the university library&nbsp;at Copenhagen. He proceeded first to Sweden, where he&nbsp;remained two years, in the course of which he made an excursion&nbsp;into Finland to study the language. Here he published, in&nbsp;Swedish, his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anglo-Saxon Grammar</span><span class="font1"> in 1817. In 1818 there&nbsp;appeared at Copenhagen, in Danish, an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Essay on the Origin of&nbsp;the Ancient Scandinavian or Icelandic Tongue,</span><span class="font1"> in which he&nbsp;traced the affinity of that idiom to the other European languages, particularly Latin and Greek. In the same year he&nbsp;brought out the first complete editions of Snorro’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edda</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;Saemund’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edda,</span><span class="font1"> in the original text, along with Swedish&nbsp;translations of both </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Eddas.</span><span class="font1"> From Stockholm he went in&nbsp;1819 to St Petersburg, where he wrote, in German, a paper on&nbsp;“ The Languages and Literature of Norway, Iceland, Sweden&nbsp;and Finland,” in the sixth number of the Vienna </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jahrbücher.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">From Russia he proceeded through Tartary into Persia, and&nbsp;resided for some time at Tabriz, Teheran, Persepolis and&nbsp;Shiraz. In about six weeks he made himself sufficiently master&nbsp;of Persian to be able to converse freely. In 1820 he embarked&nbsp;at Bushire for Bombay; and during his residence there he&nbsp;wrote, in English, “ A Dissertation on the Authenticity of the&nbsp;Zend Language” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Trans. Lit. Soc. of Bombay,</span><span class="font1"> vol. iii., reprinted with corrections and additions in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trans. R.</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">As.</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Soc.).</span><span class="font1"> From Bombay he proceeded through India to Ceylon,&nbsp;where he arrived in 1822, and soon afterwards wrote, in English,&nbsp;“ A Dissertation respecting the best Method of expressing the&nbsp;Sounds of the Indian Languages in European Characters,”&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Transactions of the Literary and Agricultural Society of&nbsp;Colombo.</span><span class="font1"> Rask returned to Copenhagen in May 1823, bringing&nbsp;a considerable number of Oriental manuscripts, Persian, Zend,&nbsp;Pali, Sinhalese and others, with which he enriched the collections of the Danish capital. He died at Copenhagen on the&nbsp;14th of November 1832.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the period between his return from the East and his death Rask published in his native language a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Spanish Grammar&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1824), a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Frisic Grammar</span><span class="font0"> (1825), an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Essay on Danish Orthography&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1826), a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Treatise respecting the Ancient Egyptian Chronology</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Italian Grammar,</span><span class="font0"> (1827), and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ancient Jewish Chronology&nbsp;pervious to Moses</span><span class="font0"> (1828). He also edited an edition of Schneider’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Danish Grammar for the use of Englishmen</span><span class="font0"> (1830), and superintended&nbsp;the English translation of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anglo-Saxon Grammar</span><span class="font0"> by Thorpe&nbsp;(1830). He was the first to point out the connexion between the&nbsp;ancient Northern and Gothic on the one hand, and the Lithuanian,&nbsp;Sclavonic, Greek and Latin on the other, and he also deserves&nbsp;credit for having had the original idea of “ Grimm’s Law ” for the&nbsp;transmutation of consonants in the transition from the old Indo-European languages to Teutonic, although he only compared&nbsp;Teutonic and Greek, Sanskrit being at the time unknown to him.&nbsp;In 1822 he was master of no less than twenty-five languages and&nbsp;dialects, and is stated to have studied twice as many. His numerous&nbsp;philological manuscripts were transferred to the king’s library at&nbsp;Copenhagen. Rask’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anglo-Saxοn, Danish</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Icelandic Grammars&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">were brought out in English editions by Thorpe, Repp and Dasent&nbsp;respectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RASPBERRY, known botanically as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rubus Idaeus</span><span class="font1"> (nat. ord. Rosaceae, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q.υ.</span><span class="font1">)</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font1"> a fruit-bush found wild in Great Britain and in&nbsp;woods throughout Europe, North Africa and in north and west&nbsp;Asia. The raspberry was known to classic writers, and is&nbsp;mentioned by Pliny as one of the wild brambles known to the&nbsp;Greeks as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Idea,</span><span class="font1"> from Mt. Ida in Asia Minor on which it grew.&nbsp;Parkinson </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Paradisus,</span><span class="font1"> 1629) speaks of red, white and thornless&nbsp;varieties as suitable for the English climate,· and Gerarde&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Herbal,</span><span class="font1"> 1597) figures and describes the Raspis or Framboise&nbsp;bush as one of the four kinds of bramble. It is propagated&nbsp;from suckers, which may be taken off the parent stools in&nbsp;October, and planted in rows 5 or 6 ft. apart, and at 3 ft. asunder&nbsp;in the rows. It is the habit of the plant to throw up from the&nbsp;root every year a number of shoots or canes, which bear fruit&nbsp;in the subsequent year, and then decay. In dressing the plants,&nbsp;which is done immediately after the crop is gathered, all these&nbsp;exhausted stems are cut away, and of the young canes only&nbsp;three or four of the strongest are left, which are shortened about&nbsp;a third. The stems, being too weak to stand by themselves,&nbsp;are sometimes connected together by the points in the form of&nbsp;arches, or a stake is driven in midway between the plants, and&nbsp;half the canes are bent one way and half the other, both being&nbsp;tied to the stake. Sometimes they are tied upright to stakes&nbsp;fixed to each stool. The best support, however, is obtained&nbsp;by fastening the points of the shoots to a slight horizontal&nbsp;rail or bar, placed a foot and a half on the south side of the rows,</span></p><div style="border-right:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
