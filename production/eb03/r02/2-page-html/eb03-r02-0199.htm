<p><span class="font0">ſince he could not by peaceable ſucceſſion. In fact, his circumſtances were ſo very deſperate, that he was&nbsp;heard to ſay, that it was equal to him whether he fell&nbsp;by his enemies in the field or by his creditors in the&nbsp;city. He therefore raiſed a moderate ſum of money,&nbsp;by felling his intereſt to a perſen who wanted a place ;&nbsp;and with this bribed two ſubaltern officers in the prætorian bands, ſupplying the deficiency of largeſſes by&nbsp;promiſes and plauſible pretences. Having in this manlier, in leſs than eight days, corrupted the fidelity of&nbsp;&quot;the ſoldiers, he ſtole ſecretly from the emperor while&nbsp;he was ſacriſicing ; and aſſembling the ſoldiers, in a&nbsp;ſhort ſpeech urged the cruelties and avarice of Galba.&nbsp;Finding theſe his invectives received with univerſal&nbsp;ſhouts by the whole army, he entirely threw off the&nbsp;maſk, and avowed his intentions of dethroning him.&nbsp;The ſoldiers being ripe for ſedition, immediately ſeconded his views: taking Otho upon their ſhoulders, they&nbsp;inſtantly proclaimed him emperor ; and, to ſtrike the&nbsp;citizens with terror, carried him with their ſwords drawn&nbsp;into the camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Galba, in the mean time, being informed of the revolt of the army, ſeemed utterly confounded, and in want of ſufficſent reſolution to face an event which he&nbsp;ſhould have long foreſeen. In this manner the poor old&nbsp;man continued wavering and doubtful ; till at laſt, being deluded by a falſe report of Otho’s being ſlain, he&nbsp;rode into the forum in complete armour, attended by&nbsp;many of his followers. Juſt at the ſame inſtant a&nbsp;body of horſe ſent ſrom the camp to deſtroy him entered on the oppoſite ſide, and each party prepared&nbsp;for the encounter. For ſome time hoſtilities were ſuſpended on each ſide ; Galba, conſuſed and irreſolute,&nbsp;and his antagoniſts ſtruck with horror at the baſeneſs&nbsp;of their enterpriſe. At length, however, finding the&nbsp;emperor in ſome meaſure deſerted by his adherents,&nbsp;they ruſhed in upon him, trampling under foot the&nbsp;crowds of people that then filled the forum. Galba ſeeing them approach, ſeemed to recollect all his former&nbsp;fortitude ; and bending his head forward, bid the aſſaſſins ſtrike it off if it were for the good of the people.&nbsp;This was quickly performed ; and his head being ſet&nbsp;upon the point of a lance, was preſented to Otho, who&nbsp;ordered it to be contemptuouſly carried round the camp ;&nbsp;his body remaining expoſed in the ſtreets till it was buried by one of his ſlaves. He died in the 73d year of&nbsp;his age, after a ſhort reign of ſeven months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No ſooner was Galba thus murdered, than the ſenate and people ran in crowds to the camp, contending who ſhould be foremoſt in extolling the virtues of the new emperor, and depreſſing the character of him&nbsp;they had ſo unjuſtly deſtroyed. Each laboured to excel the reſt in his inſtances of homage ; and the leſs his&nbsp;affections were for him, the more did he indulge all&nbsp;the vehemence of exaggerated praiſe. Otho finding&nbsp;himſelſ ſurrounded by congratulating multitudes, immediately repaired to the ſenate, where he received the&nbsp;titles uſually given to the emperors ; and from thence&nbsp;returned to the palace, ſeemingly reſolved to reform his&nbsp;liſe, and aſſume manners becoming the greatneſs of his&nbsp;ſtation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He began his reign by a ſignal inſtance of clemency, in pardoning Marius Celſus, who had been highly favoured by Galba ; and not contented with barely forgiving, he advanced him to the higheſt honours ; aſ-ſerting, that &quot; fidelity deſerved every reward.” Thia&nbsp;act of clemency was followed by another of juſtice,&nbsp;equally agreeable to the people. Tigellinus, Nero’s favourite, he who had been the promoter of all his cruelties, was now put to death ; and all ſuch as had been&nbsp;unjuſtly baniſhed, or ſtripped, at his inſtigation, during&nbsp;Nero’s reign, were reſtored to their country and fortunes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the mean time, the legions in Lower Germany having been purchaſed by the large gifts and ſpecious&nbsp;promiſes of Vitellius their general, were at length induced to proclaim him emperor ; and regardleſs of the&nbsp;ſenate, declared that they had an equal right to appoint to that high ſtation with the cohorts at Rome.&nbsp;The news of this conduct in the army ſoon ſpread conſternation throughout Rome ; but Otho was particularly ſtruck with the account, as being apprehenſive&nbsp;that nothing but the blood of his countrymen could&nbsp;decide a conteſt of which his own ambition only was&nbsp;the cauſe. He now therefore ſought to come to ail&nbsp;agreement with Vitellius; but this not ſucceeding, both&nbsp;ſides began their preparations for war. News being&nbsp;received that Vitellius was upon his march to Italy,&nbsp;Otho departed from Rome with a vaſt army to oppoſe&nbsp;him. But though he was very powerful with regard&nbsp;to numbers, his men, being little uſed to war, could&nbsp;not be relied on. He ſeemed by his behaviour ſenſible of the diſproportion of his forces ; and he is ſaid&nbsp;to have been tortured with frightful dreams and the&nbsp;moſt uneaſy apprehenſions. It is alſo reported by&nbsp;ſome, that one night fetching many profound ſighs in&nbsp;his ſleep, his ſervants ran haſtily to his bed-ſide, and&nbsp;found him ſtretched on the ground. He alleged he&nbsp;had ſeen the gſhoſt of Galba, which had, in a threatening manner, beat and puſhed him from the bed ; and&nbsp;he afterwards uſed many expiations to appeaſe it. However this be, he proceeded with a great ſhow of courage till he arrived at the city of Bιfixellum, on the river Po, where he remained, ſending his forces before&nbsp;him under the conduct of his generals Suetonius and&nbsp;Celfus, who made what haſte they could to give the&nbsp;enemy battle. The army of Vitellius, which conſiſted&nbsp;of 70,000 men, was commanded by his generals Valens and Cecina, he himſelf remaining in Gaul in order to bring up the reſt of his forces. Thus both ſide#&nbsp;haſtened to meet each other with ſo much animoſity&nbsp;and precipitation, that three conſiderable battles were&nbsp;fought in the ſpace of three days. One near Placentia,&nbsp;another near Cremona, and a third at a place called&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Caſtor ;</span><span class="font0"> in all which Otho had the advantage. But&nbsp;theſe ſucceſſes were but of ſhort-lived continuance ; for&nbsp;Valens and Cecina, who had hitherto acted ſeparately,&nbsp;joining their forces, and reinforcing their armies with&nbsp;freſh ſupplies, reſolved to come to a general engagement. Otho, who by this time had joined his army&nbsp;at a little village called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bedtàacum,</span><span class="font0"> finding the enemy,&nbsp;notwithſtanding their late loſſes, inclined to come to a&nbsp;battle, reſolved to call a council of war to determine&nbsp;upon the proper meaſures to be taken. His generals&nbsp;were of opinion to protract the war ; but others, whoſe&nbsp;inexperience had given them conſidence, declared, that&nbsp;nothing but a battle could relieve the miſeries of the&nbsp;ſtate ; proteſting, that Fortune, and all the gods, with&nbsp;the divinity of the emperor himſelf, favoured the deſign, and would undoubtedly proſper the enterpriſe.</span></p>
