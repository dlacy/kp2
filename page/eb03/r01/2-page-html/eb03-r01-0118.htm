<p><span class="font2">ing effect upon objects of ſight, is made ſufficiently evident ; and that they have the ſame effect upon objects of the other ſenſes, is alſo certain. Nor is that&nbsp;law confined to the external ſenſes ; ſor characters contraſted make a greater figure by the oppoſition : Iago,&nbsp;in the tragedy of othello, ſays,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He hath a daily beauty in his life That makes me ugly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The character of a fop, and of a rough warrior, are nowhere more ſucceſsfully contraſted than in J3hake-ſpeare :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hotſpur.</span><span class="font2"> My liege, I did deny no prifoners :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But I remember, when the ſight was done, . when I was dry with rage, and extreme toil,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Breathleſs and faint, leaning upon my ſword,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Came there a certain lord, neat, trimly dreſs’d,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Freſh as a bridegroom ; and his chin, new-reap’d, Show’d like a ſtubble-land at harveſt-home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He was perfumed like a milliner ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And ſtwixt his finger and his thumb he held</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A pouncet-box, which ever and anon</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He gave his noſe :—-and ſtill he ſmil d and talk d ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And as the ſoldiers bare dead bodies by,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He call’d them untaught knaves, unmannerly,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To bring a ſiovenly, unhandfome corſe Betwixt the wind and his nobility,&nbsp;with many holiday and lady terms&nbsp;He queſtion’d me : among the reſt, demanded&nbsp;My pris’ners, in your majeſty’s behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font2">then, aſl ſmarting with my wounds ; being gall’d To be ſo peſter’d with a popinjay,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Dut of my grief, and my impatience,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Anſwer’d, negle&lt;⅛ngly, I know not v⅛hat :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He ſhould,· or ſhould not ; for hé made me mad,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To ſee him ſhine ſo briſk, and ſmell fo ſweet,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And talk ſo like a waiting gentlewoman,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ΟΙ' guns, and drums, and wounds, ( God ſave the mark! ) And telling me, the ſovereign’ſt thing on earth&nbsp;was parmacity for an inward bruiſe ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And that it was great pity, ſo it vvas,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This villanous ſaltpetre ſhould be digg’d out of the bowels of the harmleſs earth,&nbsp;which many a good, tall fellow had deſtroy’d&nbsp;So cowardly : and but for theſe vile guns,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Paſſions and emotions are alſo enſiamed by compariſon. A man of high rank humbles the byſtanders even to annihilate them in their own opinion : Cæfar,&nbsp;beholding the ſtatue of Alexander, was greatly mortified, that now, at the age of 32, when Alexander died,&nbsp;he had not performed one memorable action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ο11Γ opinions alſo are much influenced by companion. A man whoſe opulence exceeds the ordinary ſtandard is reputed richer than he is in reality ; and&nbsp;wiſdom or weakneſs, if at all remarkable in an individual, is generally carried beyond the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The opinion a man forms of his preſent diſtreis is heightened by contraſting it with his former happi-neſs :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">______Could I forget</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">what I have been, I might the better bear IVhat Γm deſtin’d to. Γm not the ſirſt</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That have been wretched : but to think how much I have been happier.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The diſtreſs of a long journey makes even an indifferent inn agreeable : and, in travelling, when the road is good, and the horſeman well covered, a bad day&nbsp;may be agreeable, by making him ſenſible bow fnug&nbsp;he is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The ſame effect is equally remarkable, when a man oppoſes his condition to that of others. A ſhip toſ-ſed about in a ſtorm, makes the ſpectator reflect upon&nbsp;his own eaſe and ſecurity, and puts theſe in the ſtrong-eſt light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A man in grief cannot bear mirth ; it gives him a more lively notion of his unhappineſs, and of courſe&nbsp;makes him more unhappy. Satan, contemplating the&nbsp;heauties of the terreſtrial paradiſe, has the following&nbsp;exclamation :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">with what delight could I have walk’d thee round,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If I could joy in ought, ſwect interchange Οί hill and valley, rivers, woods, and plains,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now land, now fea, and ſhores with foreſt crown’d, Rocks, dcns, and caves ! but I in none of theſe&nbsp;Find place or refuge ; and the more I ſee&nbsp;Pleaſures about me, ſo much more I feel&nbsp;Torment within me, as from the hateful ſtege&nbsp;Qf contraries : all good to me becomes&nbsp;Bane, and in heav’n much worſe would be my ſtate.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The appearance of danger gives ſometimes pleafure, ſometimes pain. A timorous perſon upon the battlements of a high tower, is ſeized with fear, which even&nbsp;the conſciouſnefs of ſecurity cannot diffipate. But upon&nbsp;one of a firm head, this ſituation has a contrary effect :&nbsp;the appearance of danger heightens, by oppoſition, thc&nbsp;conſciouſnefs of ſecurity, and conſequently the fatisfaction that ariſes from ſecurity ; here the feeling reſem-bles that above-mentioned, occaſioned by a ſhip labouring in a ſtorm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The effect of magnifying or leſſening objects by means oſ compariſon is to be attributed to the in-ſtuence of paſſion over our opinions. This will evidently&nbsp;appear by reflecting in what manner a ſpectator is affected, when a very large animal is for the firſt time pla-ced befide a very ſmall one of the ſame ſpecies. The&nbsp;ſtrſt thing that ſtrikes the mind is the difference between the two animals, which is ſo great as to occaſion&nbsp;ſurpriſe ; and this, like other emotions, magnifying its&nbsp;object, makes ns conceive the difference to be the&nbsp;greateſt that can be : we ſee, or ſeem to ſee, the one&nbsp;animal extremely little, and the other extremely large.&nbsp;The emotion of ſurpriſe ariſing from any unuſual reſemblance, ſerves equally to explain, why at ſirſt view&nbsp;we are apt to think fuch reſemblance more entire than&nbsp;it is in reality. And it muſt be obſerved, that the&nbsp;circumſtances of more and lefs, which are the proper&nbsp;ſubjects of compariſon, raife a perception ſo indiſtinct&nbsp;and vague as to facilitate the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">effect </span><span class="font2">defcribed ; we&nbsp;have no mental ſtandard of great and little, nor of the&nbsp;feveral degrees of any attribute ; and the mind, thus·&nbsp;unreſtrained, is naturally diſpoſed to indulge its furprife to the utmoſt extent.</span></p>
