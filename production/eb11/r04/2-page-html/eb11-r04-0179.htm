<p><span class="font2">his school set in fashion. He knew well too how to. manage the gorgeous adjectives (“ marbrine,” “ cinabrine,” “ ivoirine ’’.and the&nbsp;like) which were another fancy of the Pléiade, and in his hands&nbsp;they rarely become stiff or cumbrous. In short, Ronsard shows&nbsp;eminently the two great attractions of French 16th-century poetry&nbsp;as compared with that of the two following ages—magnificence of&nbsp;language and imagery and graceful variety of metre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bibliography.—The chief separately published works of Ronsard are noted above. He produced, however, during his life a vast&nbsp;number of separate publications, some of them mere pamphlets or&nbsp;broadsheets, which from time to time he .collected, often, striking&nbsp;out others at the same time, in the successive editions of his works.&nbsp;Of these he himself published seven—the first in 1560, the last in&nbsp;1584. Between his death and the yeaç 1630 ten more complete&nbsp;editions were published, the most famous of which is the folio of&nbsp;1609. A copy of this presented by Sainte-Beuve to Victor Hugo,&nbsp;and later in the possession of M. Maxime du Camp, has a place of&nbsp;its own in French literary history. The work of C. Binet in 1586,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Discours de la vie de Pierre de Ronsard,</span><span class="font2"> is very important for early&nbsp;information, and the author seems to have revised some of Ronsard’s&nbsp;work under the poet’s own direction. From 1630 Ronsard was&nbsp;not again reprinted for more than two centuries. Just before the&nbsp;close of the second, however, Sainte-Beuve, printed a selection of&nbsp;his poems to accompany the above-mentioned </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tableau</span><span class="font2"> (1828).&nbsp;There are also selections by M. Noel (in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Collection Didot)</span><span class="font2"> and&nbsp;Becq de Fouquières. In 1857 M. Prosper Blanchemain, who had&nbsp;previously published a volume of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Œuvres inédites de Ronsard,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">undertook a complete edition for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bibliothèque Elzévirienne.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">The eighth and last volume of this appeared ten years later. It is&nbsp;practically complete; a few pieces of a somewhat free character&nbsp;which are ascribed with some certainty to the poet are, however,&nbsp;excluded. A later and better edition still is that of Marty-Laveaux&nbsp;(1887-1893), and another that of B. Pifteau (1891). As for criticism,&nbsp;Sainte-Beuve followed up his early work by articles in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Causeries&nbsp;du lundi,</span><span class="font2"> and the chief later critics have dealt with him in their&nbsp;collected works. Of books may be mentioned those of E. Gandar&nbsp;(Metz, 1854) .which considers him chiefly in his relation to the ancients,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ronsard, imitateur d'Homère et de Pindar e\</span><span class="font2"> the marquis de Rocham-beau, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Famille de Ronsard</span><span class="font2"> (1868) ; G.

<p><span class="font2">RONSDORF, a town of Germany, in the Prussian Rhine province, situated on the Mörsbach, a small affluent of the&nbsp;Rhine, 18 m. E. of Düsseldorf and 5 m. S. of Elberfeld-B armen&nbsp;hy rail. Pop. (1905) 14,005. It is the seat of iron, steel and&nbsp;copper industries, besides carrying on extensive manufactures&nbsp;of ribbons, trimmings and silk goods generally. It has also&nbsp;breweries, distilleries and electrical works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Founded in 1737 by the followers of Elias Eller, a religious enthusiast, Ronsdorf received civic rights in 1745. The Rons-dorf sect, the members of which called themselves Zionites, is&nbsp;now .extinct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RÖNTGEN, DAVID, sometimes called </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">David de Lunéville </span><span class="font2">(1743-1807), German cabinet-maker, eldest son of Abraham&nbsp;Röntgen, was born at Herrenhag. In 1753 his father migrated&nbsp;to the Moravian settlement at Neuwied, near Coblenz, where&nbsp;he established a furniture factory. He learned his trade in&nbsp;his father’s workshop, and succeeded to the paternal business&nbsp;in 1772, when he entered into some kind of partnership with&nbsp;the clock-maker Kintzing. At that time the name of the firm&nbsp;appears already to have been well known, at all events in&nbsp;France; but it is a curious circumstance that although he is&nbsp;always reckoned as one of the little band of foreign cabinetmakers and workers in marquetry who, like Oeben and Riesener,&nbsp;achieved distinction in France during the superb </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">floraison</span><span class="font2"> of&nbsp;the Louis Seize style, he never ceased to live at Neuwied,&nbsp;where apparently the whole of his furniture was made, and&nbsp;merely had a shop, or show-room, in Paris. We have, as it&nbsp;happens, a record of his first appearance there. The engraver&nbsp;Wille enters in his journal of August 30,1774, that “ M. Röntgen,&nbsp;célèbre ébéniste, établi à Nieuwied, près de Coblenz, m’est&nbsp;venu voir, en m’apportant une lettre de recommandation de&nbsp;M. Zick, peintre à CoDÎenz . . . Comme M. Röntgen connaissait personne à Paris, je lui fus utile en lui enseignant&nbsp;quelques sculpteurs et dessinateurs dont il avait besoin.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Röntgen was first and foremost an astute man of business, and it is not improbable that the moving cause of this opening up&nbsp;of relations with Paris was the accession to the throne of Marie&nbsp;Antoinette, whose Teutonic sympathies were only too well&nbsp;known. Before very long she appointed him her </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">éb énis teñí échanicien.</span><span class="font2"> He appears, indeed, to have acquired considerable favour with the queen, for on several occasions she&nbsp;took advantage of his journeys through Europe to charge him&nbsp;with the delivery of presents and of dolls dressed in the Paris&nbsp;fashions of the moment—they were intended to serve as patterns&nbsp;for the dressmakers—to her mother and her sisters. He&nbsp;appears at once to have opened a shop in Paris, but despite,&nbsp;and perhaps because of, the favour in which he was held at&nbsp;court, all was not plain sailing. The powerful trade corporation&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">matlres-ébénistes</span><span class="font2"> disputed his right to sell in Paris&nbsp;furniture of foreign manufacture, and in 1780 he found that the&nbsp;most satisfactory way out of the difficulty was to get himself&nbsp;admitted a member of the corporation to which all his great&nbsp;rivals belonged. By this time he had attracted a good deal of&nbsp;attention by the introduction of a new style of marquetry, in&nbsp;which light and shade, instead of being represented as hitherto&nbsp;by burning, smoking or engraving the materials, were indicated&nbsp;by small pieces of wood so arranged as to create the impression&nbsp;of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pietra dura.</span><span class="font2"> We have seen that Röntgen had been appointed&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ébéniste-méchanicien</span><span class="font2"> to Marie Antoinette, and the appointment is explained by his fondness for and proficiency in constructing furniture in which mechanical devices played a great&nbsp;part. The English cabinet-makers of the later eighteenth&nbsp;century often made what was called, with óhvious allusion to&nbsp;its character, “ harlequin furniture,” especially little dressing-tables and washstands which converted into something else or&nbsp;held their essentials in concealment until a spring was touched.&nbsp;David was a past master in this kind of work, and unquestionably much of the otherwise inexplicable reputation he enjoyed&nbsp;among contemporaries who were head and shoulders above&nbsp;him is explained by his mechanical genius. The extent of his&nbsp;fame in this direction is sufficiently indicated by the fact that&nbsp;Goethe mentions him in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Wilhelm Meister.</span><span class="font2"> He compares the&nbsp;box inhabited by the fairy during her travels with her mortal&nbsp;lover to one of Röntgen’s desks, in which “ at a pull a multitude&nbsp;of springs and latches are set in motion.” For a desk of this&nbsp;kind Louis XVI. paid him 80,000 livres. Outwardly it was&nbsp;in the form of a commode, its marquetry panels symbolizing&nbsp;the Iiheral arts. A personification of sculpture was in the act&nbsp;of engraving the name of Marie Antoinette upon a column to&nbsp;which Minerva was hanging her portrait. Above a riot of&nbsp;architectural orders was a musical clock (the work of the&nbsp;partner Kintzing), surmounted by a cupola representing Parnassus. The interior of this monumental effort, 11 ft. high,&nbsp;was a marvel of mechanical precision; it disappeared during&nbsp;the First Empire. Röntgen did not confine his activities to&nbsp;Paris, or even to France. It has been said that he travelled&nbsp;about Europe accompanied by furniture vans, and undoubtedly&nbsp;his aptitude as a commercial traveller was remarkable. He&nbsp;had shops in Berlin and St Petersburg, and himself apparently&nbsp;twice went to Russia. On one of these visits he sold to the&nbsp;Empress Catherine furniture to the value of 20,000 roubles,&nbsp;to which she added a personal present of 5000 roubles and a&nbsp;gold snuff-box—in recognition, it would seem, of his readiness&nbsp;and ingenuity in surmounting a secretaire with a clock indicating&nbsp;the date of the Russian naval victory over the Turks at Cheshme,&nbsp;news of which had arrived on the previous evening. This suite&nbsp;of furniture is helieved still to be in the Palace of the Hermitage,&nbsp;the hiding-place of so much remarkable and forgotten art. To&nbsp;the protection of the queen of France and the empress of Russia&nbsp;David added that of the king of Prussia, Frederick William II.,&nbsp;who in 1792 made him a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Commerzienrath</span><span class="font2"> and commercial agent&nbsp;for the Lower Rhine district. The French Revolution and&nbsp;the Napoleonic Wars which so speedily followed, eclipsed&nbsp;Rontgen’s star as they eclipsed those of so many other great&nbsp;cabinet-makers of the period. In 1793 the Revolutionary&nbsp;government, regarding him as an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">émigré,</span><span class="font2"> seized the contents</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
