<p><label>ROLLING</label>
the motion by which a ſhip rocks from ſide to ſide like a cradle, occaſioned by the agitation of the waves.</p><p>Rolling, therefore, is a ſort of revolution about an imaginary axis paſſing through the centre of gravity of a ſhip : ſo that the nearer the centre of gravity is to the keel, the more violent will be the rolling motion ; becauſe the centre about which the vibrations are made is placed ſo low in the bottom, that the reſiſtance made by the keel to the volume of water which it diſplaces in rolling, bears very little proportion to the force of the vibration above the centre of gravity, tlre radius of which extends as high as the maſt-heads.</p><p>But if the centre of gravity is placed higher above -the keel, the radius of vibration will not only be diminiſhed, but an additional force to oppoſe the motion of rolling will be. communicated to that part of the ſhip’s bottom which is below the centre of gravity.</p><p>So far as relates to the effect of rolling, when produced by the quality or ſtowage of the ballaſt, and to the manner by which it may be prevented, viz. a change of the quantity or diſpoſition of the ballaſt, we ſliall endeavo-ur to explain under the article Trim. It may, however, be neceſſary to remark, that the conſtruction of the ſhip’s bottom may alſo contribute to ſtiminiſh this movement conſiderably.</p><p>Many fatal diſaſters have happened to ſhips ariſing ſrom a violent rolling ; as the loſs of the maſts, looſen-ing of the cannon, and ſtraining violently on the decks and ſides, ſo as to weaken the ſhip to a great degree.
