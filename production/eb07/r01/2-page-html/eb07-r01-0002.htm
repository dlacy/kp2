<p><span class="font0">blishment that he made the acquaintance of the brothers Du Bellay, one of them afterwards the celebrated Cardinal,&nbsp;a connexion which lasted through life, and ultimately proved&nbsp;of the greatest service to him. After passing through the&nbsp;usual preparatory studies, Rabelais was admitted into the&nbsp;order of Cordeliers at the convent of Fontenay-le-Compte&nbsp;in Poitou, where he assumed the religious habit. Here he&nbsp;prosecuted his studies with such zeal, as to retrieve any loss&nbsp;of time which indifference or injudicious tutors might previously have occasioned. Striking out of the usual routine&nbsp;of scholastic study, which then held undivided sway in the&nbsp;monastic houses, he applied himself, with unusual industry&nbsp;and research, to the cultivation of the sciences It was his&nbsp;aim, says Niceron, to become a grammarian, poet, philosopher, physician, jurisconsult, and astronomer, and his works&nbsp;bear ample testimony to his success. He possessed a peculiar aptitude for the acquisition of the languages ; an aptitude&nbsp;which afterwards showed itself in his command of Italian,&nbsp;Spanish, German, English, Hebrew, and Arabic. At this period, in fact, he was a perfect master of the Latin and Greek&nbsp;tongues, the latter of which had for some time been engaging the attention of the most enlightened spirits of the age.&nbsp;Within the walls of Fontenay-le-Compte, however, a Greek&nbsp;book was looked upon as no better than a work of magic,&nbsp;and the man who commanded the key to its secrets passed&nbsp;for a trafficker in “ the arts inhibited ;” and it appears, by a&nbsp;letter from Budæus to a friend, that Rabelais’ attachment to&nbsp;the Greek writers drew upon him the hatred and persecution of his fellow monks. His independence of spirit, and&nbsp;generous ardour in the pursuit of learning, which could not&nbsp;but be felt as a reproach to their own resolute ignorance,&nbsp;pedantry, and sloth, was continually furnishing fresh incentives to their rancour, and they omitted no opportunity of&nbsp;subjecting him to annoyance. Worn out by repeated aggressions, he followed the advice of his friends, and resolved&nbsp;to quit a society where he found so little that was congenial to his own disposition. It has been alleged, that the&nbsp;true cause of this step was his own profligacy ; but this is&nbsp;only the first of the many groundless charges against him,&nbsp;engendered either by the malice of his enemies, or originating in a misapprehension of his character as seen in his writings, namely, that of a man whose whole life was a noisy jest,&nbsp;a soulless round of sensual indulgences. Had such really&nbsp;been his character, as has been pertinently remarked by Père</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Niceron, “ these were not the days, when, for such a cause, he needed to have left his monastery ; he might have given&nbsp;free rein to his propensities there, and yet not have been&nbsp;going out of the ordinary course.” The authority of a&nbsp;churchman on such a point is conclusive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1523, a brief was obtained from Pope Clement VII., allowing him to pass from the order of St. Francis into that&nbsp;of St. Benedict, and leaving this “pack of capuchins, monks,&nbsp;who forbade the use of beans, that is, Pantagrueline books,”&nbsp;to borrow a phrase from the prologue to the fifth book of&nbsp;his Romance, he entered the monastery of Maillezais in&nbsp;Poitou, where he remained during several years. But he&nbsp;appears to have found himself little better off in his present&nbsp;situation, than in that which he had left. It did not present him, it is said, with such resources as he desired for&nbsp;extending the limits of his knowledge, more especially as&nbsp;regarded medical science. His motives for this step were&nbsp;doubtless of a mingled nature, of which it is but reasonable&nbsp;to suppose the chief was a disgust at the torpor and profitless seclusion of a monastic life, by escaping from which he&nbsp;could alone hope to find opportunities for exercising his&nbsp;stirring and strongly practical intellect in a field of action,&nbsp;observation, and experience, sufficiently ample for its desires. How<sup>,</sup>ever this may be, he laid down the regular habit&nbsp;for that of a secular priest, and quitted Maillezais without&nbsp;the sanction of his superior, a breach of ecclesiastical discipline which exposed him to its severest censures. After&nbsp;rambling about for some time in the diligent pursuit of medical knowledge, as he says himself in his petition to Pope'&nbsp;Paul III. praying for absolution from the penalties incurred&nbsp;by his unauthorised retirement from Maillezais, he settled at&nbsp;Montpellier, after taking his physician’s degree at its university, and practised the medical profession there with credit&nbsp;and success. It appears by the dedication to Godefroy&nbsp;D’Estissac, bishop of Maillezais, of an edition of Hippocrates’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aphorisms,</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ars Parva</span><span class="font0"> of Galen, published&nbsp;by Rabelais in 1532, at Lyons, and highly esteemed by the&nbsp;medical and literary men of the time, that his lectures on&nbsp;physic at the university of that place had attracted considerable attention. Such, indeed, was the distinction he attained,&nbsp;that he was selected by tile university as their deputy to&nbsp;procure a restitution of the privileges of which one of its&nbsp;colleges had been denuded by the chancellor Du Prat. The&nbsp;means employed by Rabelais for obtaining access to the&nbsp;chancellor have formed the subject of a story to be found&nbsp;in all his biographies ; but it is too obviously a fabrication&nbsp;from an incident in his own Romance, (the introduction of&nbsp;Panurge to Pantagruel, book ii. c. ix.) to be worth a place&nbsp;here. He succeeded in the object of his mission, and his&nbsp;services to the university were perpetuated in a custom,&nbsp;still, according to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Biographie Universelle,</span><span class="font0"> in existence,&nbsp;by which every candidate is required to put on Rabelais’&nbsp;gown upon receiving his physician’s degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1533, we find him established at Lyons, where he was hospital physician, and taught and practised for several&nbsp;years. At the commencement of the year 1534, his old&nbsp;schoolfellow and friend, Jean du Bellay, then bishop of Paris,&nbsp;having occcasion to pass through Lyons on his way to the&nbsp;papal court, regarding the divorce of Henry VIII. of England, took Rabelais along with him in the capacity of his&nbsp;physician ; thus enabling him to realise, what had long&nbsp;been his passionate wish, a personal acquaintance with Italy&nbsp;and the Eternal City. For, to use the words of his dedication to Du Bellay of an edition of Marliani’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Typogra-phia Antiquae Romœ,</span><span class="font0"> published, under Rabelais’ superintendence, by Gryphius, at Lyons, in 1534, “ from the first&nbsp;moment that I was able to appreciate the worth of polite&nbsp;learning, it was amongst the foremost of my desires to travel&nbsp;throughout Italy, and visit the capital of the Roman world.”&nbsp;The opportunity for gratifying the popular conceptions of&nbsp;his character, afforded by this visit of the great satirist of&nbsp;the abuses of the Romish church to the court of its supreme&nbsp;head, has not been let slip by the anecdote-mongers ; and&nbsp;several absurd stories of his conduct have accordingly been&nbsp;handed down from biographer to biographer, till they seem&nbsp;almost to have acquired the authority of undoubted truths.&nbsp;One specimen of these will be sufficient. When the Cardinal&nbsp;Du Bellay was presented to the Pope, he, as ambassador&nbsp;of Francis I., went through the usual ceremony of kissing&nbsp;his holiness’s slipper. His suite followed his example, all&nbsp;except Rabelais, who remained leaning against a pillar, and&nbsp;exclaimed loud enough to be heard, That if his master, who&nbsp;was a great lord in France, were unworthy to kiss the pope's&nbsp;feet, his holiness might untruss, and possibly, after reasonable abstersion, a part might be found, where an humble&nbsp;follower like himself might presume to apply his lips. The&nbsp;improbability, that Rabelais should have expressed himself&nbsp;in these terms, filling the situation which he did, and when,&nbsp;too, he was on the eve of supplicating a release from this&nbsp;very pope from the ecclesiastical penalties he had incurred&nbsp;by his unauthorised desertion of the monastery Of Maillezais,&nbsp;speaks sufficiently for the worthlessness of this story. But&nbsp;its real source is obvious enough, and may be found in book&nbsp;iv. c. 48. of his Romance. It needed but a poor invention&nbsp;to construct such a tale out of the extravagant devotion of&nbsp;the worthies that greeted Pantagruel and his band, on their&nbsp;arrival at the Island of Papimany. That, however, which, as&nbsp;told by Rabelais himself, is a stroke of the most caustic satire,</span></p>
