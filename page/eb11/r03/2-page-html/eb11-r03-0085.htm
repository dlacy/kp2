            <p><span class="font0">RITUAL MURDER, a general term for human sacrifice in connexion
                    with religious ceremonies. False accusations as&nbsp;to the practice of ritual
                    murder by Jews and Christians have&nbsp;often been made. “ The Christians of the
                    second and third&nbsp;centuries suffered severely under them ” (Strack).
                    Justin&nbsp;Martyr (150-160) in his Second Apology (ch. 12)
                    vigorously&nbsp;defends the Christian community against this charge;
                    Octavius,&nbsp;Minucius Felix, Tertullian, Origen and other Church
                    Fathers&nbsp;all refer to the subject and indignantly repudiate the
                    atrocious&nbsp;libel that the Eucharist involved human sacrifice. The
                    myth&nbsp;was revived against the Montanists, and in the later middle&nbsp;ages
                    against various sects of heretical Christians. In recent&nbsp;years the
                    accusation has been again levelled against&nbsp;“ foreigners ” during the
                    disturbances in China. The chief&nbsp;sufferers, however, from the charge were
                    the Jews. The&nbsp;charge was never coherently defined, but a notion
                    prevailed&nbsp;that at the Passover Christian blood was used in Jewish
                    rites.&nbsp;For this belief there is no foundation whatever, as is proved
                    in&nbsp;the classical treatise@@<sup>1</sup> on the subject by Hermann L.
                    Strack,&nbsp;Regius Professor of Theology at Berlin University. The
                    first&nbsp;occasion on which the medieval Jews were accused of the
                    murder&nbsp;of a Christian child was at Norwich in Π44. In the
                    following&nbsp;century other instances of the charge occurred on the Continent,
                    and by this time (middle of ,the 13th century) the legend&nbsp;had grown into a
                    belief that “ the Jews of every province&nbsp;annually decide by lot ” which
                    congregation or town is to be&nbsp;the scene of the mythical murder. It is easy
                    to understand&nbsp;how in ages when the Jews were everywhere regarded
                    with&nbsp;superstitious awe, such stories to their detriment would
                    find&nbsp;ready credence, but the revival of the myth in recent times
                    by&nbsp;the anti-Semite is a deplorable instance of degeneration. It&nbsp;is
                    only necessary here to refer to the Lincoln case (1255), the&nbsp;Trent case
                    (1475) and more recently the Damascus case (1840)1&nbsp;the Tisza-EszIar affair
                    (1882), the Xanten charge (i89r) and&nbsp;the Polna case (1899). AU of these
                    charges—sometimes&nbsp;invented by malicious seceders from the Jewish
                    fold—were&nbsp;foUowed by spoliation and tragic persecution of the Jews.&nbsp;On
                    the other hand many Jewish proselytes to Christianity&nbsp;have strenuously
                    defended the Jews from the charge, among&nbsp;them may be particularly named
                    Prof. D. Chwolson </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"
                    >{Blutanklage,</span><span class="font0"> 1901). In 1840 a protest against the
                    charge was signed&nbsp;by 58 Jewish-Christians, the list being headed by M. S.
                    Alexander, Anglican bishop at Jerusalem. Further testimonies&nbsp;of a similar
                    kind are collected in Strack </span><span class="font0"
                    style="font-style:italic;">{op. cit.</span><span class="font0"> p. 239).
                    Many&nbsp;of the popes have issued bulls exonerating the Jews (cf.
                    Strack,&nbsp;p. 250); similarly temporal princes have often taken a
                    similar&nbsp;step (ibid. p. 260). Many Christian scholars and
                    ecclesiastics&nbsp;have felt it their duty to utter protests in favour of the
                    Jews.&nbsp;Among them have been the most eminent Christian students&nbsp;of
                    Rabbinism of recent times, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"

                    DaIman and J. von DolIinger. A careful&nbsp;examination of the evidence (with a
                    complete acquittal of&nbsp;the Jews) is contained in a notable work by a

                    the&nbsp;charge was A. Rohling, the worthlessness of whose writings&nbsp;on the

            <p><span class="font0">RIVAROL, ANTOINE DE (1753-1801), French writer and epigrammatist,
                    was born at Bagnols in Languedoc on the&nbsp;26th of June 1753, and died at
                    Berlin on the nth of April&nbsp;1801. It seems that his father was an innkeeper
                    but a man&nbsp;of cultivated tastes. The son assumed the title of comte
                    de&nbsp;Rivarol, and asserted his connexion with a noble Italian
                    family,&nbsp;but his enemies said that the name was really Riverot<sub>1</sub>
                    and&nbsp;that the family was not noble. After various vicissitudes
                    he&nbsp;appeared in Paris in 17.77. After winning some academic&nbsp;prizes,
                    Rivarol distinguished himself in the year 1784 by a&nbsp;treatise </span><span
                    class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sur l’universalité de la langue

                    assistance from a man of similar but&nbsp;lesser talent,
                        Champcenetz,@@<sup>2</sup> compiled a lampoon, entitled&nbsp;</span><span

                    future talent and a great many&nbsp;nobodies were ridiculed in the most pitiless
                    manner. When&nbsp;the Revolution developed the importance of the press,
                    Rivarol&nbsp;at once took up arms on the Royalist side, and wrote in
                    the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Journal

                    Brussels,&nbsp;whence he removed successively to London, Hamburg
                    and&nbsp;Berlin. Rivarol has had no rival in France except Piron&nbsp;in sharp
                    conversational sayings. These were mostly ill-natured,&nbsp;and mostly have a
                    merely local application. Their brilliancy,&nbsp;however, can escape no one. His
                    brother, Claude François&nbsp;(1762-1848), was also an 'author. His works
