a frame of timber, ſtone, or other matter, ſerving to retain and raiſe the water of a river, &amp; c. and on occaſion to let it paſs.</p><p>Such is the ſluice of a mill, which ſtops and collects the water of a rivulet, &amp; c. to let it fall at length in the greater plenty upon the mill-wheel : ſuch alſo are thoſe uſed as vents or drains to diſcharge water off land. And ſuch are the ſluices of Flanders, Sec. which ſerve to prevent the waters of the ſea from overflowing the lower lands.</p><p>Sometimes there is a kind of canal incloſed between two gates or ſluices, in artificial navigations, to save the water, and render the paſſage of boats equally eaſy and ſafe, upwards and downwards ; as in the ſluices of Briare in France, which are a kind of maſſive walls built parallel to each other, at the diſtance of 20 or 24 feet, cloſed with ſtrong gates at each end, between which is a kind of canal or chamber, conſiderably longer than broad ; wherein a veſſel being incloſed, the water is let out at the firſt gate, by which the veſſel is raiſed 15 or 16 feet, and paſſed out of this canal into another much higher. By ſuch means a boat is conveyed out of the</p><p>Loire into the Seine, though the ground between them riſe above 150 feet higher than either of thoſe rivers<note anchored="true" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* See Canal.</p></note> *.</p><p>Sluices are made different ways, according to the uſe for which they are intended : when they ſerve for navigation, they are ſhut with two gates, preſenting an angle towards the ſſream ; when they are made near the ſea, two pair of gates are made, the one to keep the water out and the other in, as occaſion requires : in this caſe, the gates towards the ſea preſent an angle that way, and the others the contrary way ; and the ſpace incloſed by thoſe gates is called the <hi rend="italic">chamber.</hi> When ſluices are made in the ditches of a fortreſs, to keep up the water in ſome parts, inſtead of gates, ſhutters are made ſo as to slide up and down in grooves ; and when they are made to raiſe an inundation, they are then ſhut by means of ſquare timbers let down in culliſes, ſo as to lie cloſe and firm,</p><p>The word <hi rend="italic">ſluice</hi> is formed of the French <hi rend="italic">eſcluse,</hi> which Menage derives from the Latin <hi rend="italic">excluſa,</hi> found in the Salic law in the ſame ſenſe. But this is to be reſtrained to the ſluices of mills, &amp; c. ſor as to thoſe ſerving to raiſe veſſels, they were wholly unknown to the ancients.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
