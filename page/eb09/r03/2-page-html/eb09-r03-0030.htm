<p><span class="font1">duct of this period was oratory, developed indeed with the aid of these rhetorical studies, but itself the immediate&nbsp;outcome of the imperial interests, the legal conflicts, and&nbsp;the political passions of that time of agitation. The&nbsp;speakers and writers of a later age looked back on Scipio&nbsp;and Lælius, the Gracchi and their contemporaries, L.&nbsp;Crassus and M. Antonius, as masters of their art. We&nbsp;can only judge of what they were by the fame of their&nbsp;speeches and a few unimportant fragments. But as we&nbsp;infer from the artistic excellence of the Homeric poems&nbsp;that many poets of power and genius, whose names were&nbsp;soon forgotten, preceded the great master ; as we know&nbsp;that the art of Shakespeare did not come without due&nbsp;preparation into the world ; so from the mature perfection&nbsp;of the art of Cicero we may, in a measure, judge of the&nbsp;power and accomplishment of the orators who came before&nbsp;him, from whom he professes to have learned much, and&nbsp;whom he regarded with generous admiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In history, regarded as a great branch of prose literature, it is not probable that much was accomplished, although,&nbsp;with the advance of oratory and grammatical studies,&nbsp;there must have been not only greater fluency of composition but the beginning of a richer and more ornate style.&nbsp;Yet Cicero, so candid and indulgent in his estimate of&nbsp;early Roman poetry and oratory, denies to Rome the&nbsp;existence, before his own time, of any adequate historical&nbsp;literature. Nevertheless it was by the work of a number&nbsp;of Roman chroniclers during this period that the materials&nbsp;of early Roman history were systematized, and the record&nbsp;of the state, as it was finally given to the world in the&nbsp;artistic work of Livy, was extracted from the early annals,&nbsp;state documents, and private memorials, combined into&nbsp;a coherent unity, and supplemented by invention and reflexion. There were also special works on Roman antiquities and contemporary memoirs, which formed the&nbsp;sources of future historians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although the artistic product of the first period of Roman literature which has reached us in a complete&nbsp;shape is limited to the comedies of Plautus and Terence,&nbsp;the influence of the lost literature in determining the&nbsp;spirit, form, and style of the eras of more perfect accomplishment which followed is unmistakable. While humour&nbsp;and vivacity, which were not surpassed in the more advanced stages of literature, had characterized the earlier,&nbsp;and an urbanity of tone, with which Horace by frequent&nbsp;imitation acknowledges his sympathy, characterizes the&nbsp;later development of comedy, the tendency of serious&nbsp;literature had been in the main practical, ethical, commemorative, and satirical. The higher poetical imagination had appeared only in Ennius, and had been called&nbsp;forth in him by sympathy with the grandeur of the national&nbsp;life and the great personal qualities of its representative&nbsp;men. Some of the chief motives of the later poetry, such&nbsp;as the love of nature and the pleasures and sorrows of&nbsp;private life, had as yet found scarcely any expression in&nbsp;Roman literature. The fittest metrical vehicle for epic,&nbsp;didactic, and satiri∕ poetry had been discovered, but its&nbsp;movement was as yet rude and inharmonious. The idiom&nbsp;of ordinary life and social intercourse and the more fervid&nbsp;and elevated diction of oratorical prose had made great&nbsp;progress, but the language of imagination and poetical&nbsp;feeling was, if vivid and impressive in isolated expressions,&nbsp;still incapable of being wrought into consecutive passages&nbsp;of artistic composition. Although the impulse which&nbsp;awoke the literary energy of Rome had come from the&nbsp;semi-Greeks of the south of Italy, the character of the&nbsp;literature was in the main Roman and Latin ; and to this&nbsp;may be attributed the preponderance of the prosaic over&nbsp;the poetical element in it. The Sabellian races of central&nbsp;and eastern Italy and the Italo-Celtic and Venetian races&nbsp;of the north, in whom the poetic susceptibility of Italy&nbsp;was most manifest two generations later, were not, until&nbsp;after the Social War, sufficiently in sympathy with Rome,&nbsp;and were probably not as yet sufficiently educated to&nbsp;induce them to contribute their share to the national&nbsp;literature. Hence the end of the Social War, and of the&nbsp;Civil War which arose out of it, is most clearly a determining factor in Roman literature, and may most appropriately be taken as marking the end of one period and&nbsp;the beginning of another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Second Period : from</span><span class="font0"> 80 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font0"> 42 B.c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The last age of the republic coincides with the first half of the Golden Age of Roman literature. It is generally&nbsp;known as the Ciceronian age from the name of its greatest&nbsp;literary representative, whose activity as a speaker and&nbsp;writer was unremitting during nearly the whole period.&nbsp;It is the age of purest excellence in prose, and of a new&nbsp;birth of poetry, characterized rather by great original force&nbsp;and artistic promise than by perfect accomplishment. The&nbsp;five chief representatives of this age who still hold their&nbsp;rank among the great classical writers are Cicero, Cæsar,&nbsp;Sallust, Lucretius, and Catullus. The works of other prose&nbsp;writers, Varro and Cornelius Nepos, have been partially&nbsp;preserved ; but these writers have no claim to rank with&nbsp;those already mentioned as creators and masters of literary&nbsp;style. Although literature had not as yet become, as it&nbsp;did in the age of Martial, and to a certain extent in the&nbsp;age represented in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Epistles</span><span class="font1"> of Horace, a trade or profession, an educated reading public already existed, and&nbsp;books and intellectual intercourse filled a large part of the&nbsp;leisure of men actively engaged in affairs. Even oratory&nbsp;was intended quite as much for readers as for the audiences&nbsp;to which it was immediately addressed ; and some of the&nbsp;greatest speeches which have come down from that great&nbsp;age of orators were never delivered at all, but were published as manifestoes after the event with the view of influencing educated opinion, and as works of art with the&nbsp;view of giving pleasure to educated taste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thus the speeches of Cicero (106-43), more certainly than any modern speeches, belong to the domain of literature&nbsp;quite as much as to that of forensic or political oratory. And,&nbsp;although Demosthenes is a master of style unrivalled even&nbsp;by Cicero, the literary interest of most of Cicero’s speeches&nbsp;is greater than that of the great mas3 of Greek oratory,—&nbsp;a result of what from a forensic point of view would now&nbsp;be regarded as a serious defect. Thus it is with justice&nbsp;urged that the greater part of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Defence of Archias</span><span class="font1"> was&nbsp;irrelevant to the issue and would not have been listened&nbsp;to by a Greek court of justice or a modern jury. But it&nbsp;was fortunate for the interests of literature that a court of&nbsp;educated Romans could be influenced by the considerations&nbsp;there submitted to them. In this way a question of the&nbsp;most temporary interest, concerning an individual of no&nbsp;particular eminence or importance, has produced one of&nbsp;the most impressive vindications of literature ever spoken&nbsp;or written. Oratory at Rome assumed a new type from&nbsp;being cultivated as an art Which endeavoured to produce&nbsp;persuasion not so much by intellectual conviction as by&nbsp;appeal to those general human sympathies which are the&nbsp;subject-matter with which literature has to deal. In&nbsp;oratory, as in every other intellectual province, the Greeks&nbsp;had a truer sense of the limits and conditions of their art.&nbsp;But command over form is only one element in the making&nbsp;of an orator or poet. The largeness and dignity of the&nbsp;matter with which he has to deal is at least as important.&nbsp;The Roman oratory of the law courts had to deal not with&nbsp;petty questions of disputed property, of fraud, or violence,&nbsp;but with great imperial questions, with matters affecting&nbsp;the wellbeing of large provinces and the honour and safety</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
