<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">It is highly probable that the other branches of the same ethnic family, the Mongolian and the Turkish, and&nbsp;the other members of the same branch, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">., the Magyars,&nbsp;originally did not differ much from the Finnic in religious&nbsp;ideas and customs. Unfortunately we are here able to&nbsp;judge only by analogy, partly because we are but imperfectly informed, partly because most of these nations have&nbsp;long been converted to Buddhism, Mohammedanism, and&nbsp;Christianity. Nor do we know in how far the Tibetans,&nbsp;Burmese, Siamese, and other peoples nearly related to the&nbsp;Chinese had originally a similar worship, as all of them&nbsp;are now faithful Buddhists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The question whether the religion of the primitive inhabitants of Mesopotamia (Sumer-Akkad) has any genealogical relation to that of the Chinese and the Ural-Altaic&nbsp;family, as some scholars now try to prove, is not yet ripe&nbsp;for solution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Aboriginal Religions of America</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">.—The religions of the Eskimo (Esquimantsic, Ashkimeg, as their Redskin&nbsp;neighbours call them) or Innuyt (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">., “men,״ as they call&nbsp;themselves) should be clearly distinguished from those of&nbsp;the other American nations. Though some of their customs and notions resemble those of the latter, there are&nbsp;others, and it would seem the most important, which are&nbsp;of the same character as those prevailing among the Ural-Altaians and Mongols. Now, as they belong ethnically&nbsp;to the Hyperborean or Arctic nations, who inhabit not&nbsp;only the extreme north of America from east to west, but&nbsp;also the islands between the two continents and besides a&nbsp;part of the east of Siberia, and as these Hyperboreans are&nbsp;physically akin to the Mongolian race, we might suppose&nbsp;that the American elements in the Eskimo religion have&nbsp;been borrowed, and that it must be considered to have&nbsp;been originally a member of the Ural-Altaic family. Their&nbsp;division of the world of spirits into those of the sea, the&nbsp;fire, the mountains, and the winds, with Torngarsuk (chief&nbsp;of spirits), the heaven-god, as the highest, and their belief&nbsp;in the magical power of their sorcerers, the Angekoks, do&nbsp;not differ from those which characterize the Ural-Altaic&nbsp;religions. At any rate the religion of the Eskimo is the&nbsp;connecting link between the latter and those of the&nbsp;American aborigines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">That all the other religions of North and South America are most closely allied is generally admitted, and is indeed&nbsp;beyond doubt. Several myths, like those of the sun-liero,&nbsp;of the moon-goddess, of the four brothers (the winds),@@<sup>1</sup> are&nbsp;found in their characteristic American form among the&nbsp;most distant tribes of both continents. Some religious&nbsp;customs, scarcely less characteristic, such as the sweating&nbsp;bath, intended to cause a state of ecstasy, the ball-play, a&nbsp;kind of ordeal, the sorcery by means of the rattle, are all&nbsp;but generally practised. Fetichism and idolatry are much&nbsp;less developed among the Americans than among other&nbsp;uncivilized and semi-civilized races, but a marked tendency&nbsp;to gloomy rites and bloody self-torture is common to all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The American family of religions may be divided into the following principal groups. (1) Those of the Redskins&nbsp;of North America, from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, all&nbsp;of whom have in common the worship of the great spirit&nbsp;(Kitche Manitoo, Michabo, Wahcon[da], Anduagni, Oki)&nbsp;who is the ghost of heaven, the highest wind-god, to whom&nbsp;all other spirits, even those of the sun and the moon, are</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">subordinate; also the hero myth which has sprung from that belief, and the so-called totemism, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> the adoption&nbsp;of a special tutelar genius, usually in animal form, for&nbsp;every individual family. (2) Those of the Aztec race,&nbsp;comprising the Aztecs, Toltecs, and Nahuas, who are&nbsp;spread from Vancouver’s Island to Nicaragua. To this&nbsp;branch belongs that strange mixture of more elevated&nbsp;religious ideas and barbarous rites which was the state&nbsp;worship of the Mexican empire, but which for its purer&nbsp;elements was indebted to the conquered race, the Mayas&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Mexico). (3) </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Those of the original inhabitants of the&nbsp;Antilles, to whom the Mayas in Yucatan and the Natchez&nbsp;between the Red River and the Mississippi seem to be&nbsp;nearly related. They are one of the most gifted nations&nbsp;of the American race, with an interesting mythology and&nbsp;highly-developed religious ideas, but perhaps weakened by&nbsp;civilization and therefore unable to withstand the more&nbsp;warlike barbarous tribes, by wlipm they were finally subjugated. (4) That of the Muyscas (Chibchas) in South&nbsp;America. Originally they seem to have had the same&nbsp;worship as the Nicaraguans. At least the Nicaraguan&nbsp;god Fomagazdad, the creator of mankind and the consort&nbsp;of the moon-goddess, acts a part in the principal myth of&nbsp;the Muyscas, under the name of Fomagata. But after&nbsp;the latter had reached a higher stage of civilization they&nbsp;adored the god Bochika as its principal founder, and&nbsp;Fomagata became a dethroned tyrant, while the moon-goddess, now an evil deity, tried to spoil the beneficent&nbsp;works of Bochika. There is some likeness between their&nbsp;hierarchical political institutions and those of Peru, but&nbsp;they were never subjected to the power of the Incas, and&nbsp;it is not proved that they borrowed their culture from&nbsp;them. (5) Those of the Quichua, Aymara, and their relatives, which culminated in the sun worship of the Incas in&nbsp;Peru, spread by them throughout all the countries they&nbsp;conquered, and even reformed by some of them to a tolerably pure and elevated theism (not monotheism, as Dr&nbsp;Brinton contends). This most interesting religion ranks&nbsp;highest among all the faiths of the two American con-tinents, those of Central America not excepted. This&nbsp;remarkable progress is not to be derived from the influence&nbsp;of foreign settlers, come from Asia or Europe, but is here,&nbsp;as well as in Central America, the product of natural&nbsp;growth favoured by happy circumstances. (6) Those of&nbsp;the warlike Caribs and Arowaks, extending along the&nbsp;whole of the north coast of South America, who subjugated&nbsp;the peaceful inhabitants of the Antilles to their rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Brazilian aborigines (Tupi-guaranos, Indios mansos), who form a distinct group, and the south-eastern and&nbsp;southern tribes (Abipones, Pampas Indians, Puelches, Patagonians or Tehuelches, Fuegians) have religious notions&nbsp;and customs quite in accordance with the low degree of&nbsp;their civilization. Only the Araucanians, though ethnically the nearest relations of the Fuegians and perhaps of&nbsp;the Pampas Indians, have a somewhat advanced sun worship, but seem to have been influenced by the ascendency&nbsp;of Peruvian culture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Lastly we come to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Malayo-Polynesian</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> family of religions. The primitive ethnic unity of this widely&nbsp;scattered race, which, including the Micronesians and&nbsp;Melanesians, inhabits the islands in the Great Pacific from&nbsp;Easter Island to the Pelew Archipelago, the East Indian&nbsp;Archipelago, and the Malay Peninsula, and to which belong&nbsp;the Hovas of Madagascar, has been established on sufficient&nbsp;evidence. As to their primitive religious unity we cannot&nbsp;be equally positive. The original religions of the ]Malay&nbsp;archipelago have given ])lace first to Brahmanism and&nbsp;Buddhism, afterwards to !Mohammedanism, lastly, though&nbsp;only sporadically, to Christianity. But, so far as we can&nbsp;iudce from what has still survived of the aboriginal</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> The myth of the four brothers is met with, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> among the Algonkins, the Mayas in Yucatan, the Tzendal branch of the Maya&nbsp;race, the Tarascos in Michoacan near Mexico, the Aztecs, by whom it&nbsp;is combined with that of Quetzalcoatl, all through North America,&nbsp;and even in Peru.
