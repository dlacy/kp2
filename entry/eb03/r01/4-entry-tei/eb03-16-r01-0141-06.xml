<p><label>RETORT</label>
in chemiſtry, an oblong or globular vef-∙ fel with its neck bent, proper for diſtillation. See Chemistry, n <hi rend="sup">o</hi> 576.</p><p>In the fifth volume of the Tranfactions of the London Society for the Encouragement of Arts, p. 96. we find a paper containing a method for preventing ſtone retorts from breaking ; or flopping them when cracked, during any chemical operation, without lofing any oſ the contained ſubject. " I have always found it neceffary (fays the writer) to uſe a previous coating for filling up the interftices of the earth or ſtone, which is made by diffolving two ounces of borax in a pint of boiling water, and adding to the folution as much flaked lime as will make it into a thin paſte ; this, with a common painter’s bruſh, may be ſpread over feveral retorts, which when dry are then ready for the proper preſerving coating. The intention of this firſt coating is, that the ſubſtances thus ſpread over, readily vitrifv-ing in the fire, prevent any of the diſtilling matters from pervading the retort, but does in nowiſe prevent it from cracking.</p><p>" whenever I want to afe any of the above coated retorts ; after I have charged them with the ſubſtance to be diſtilled, I prepare a thin paſte, made with common linfeed oil and flaked lime well mixed, and perfect-ly plaſtic, that it may be eaſily ſpread : with this let the retorts be covered all over except that part of the neck which is to be inferted into the receiver ; this is readily done with a painter’s bruſh : the coating will be ſuſſiciently dry in a day or two, and they will then be ſit for ufe. with this coating I have for feveral years worked my ſtone retorts, without any danger of their breaking, and have frequently uſed the fame retort four or live times ; obſervſhg particularly to coat ■ it over with the laſt mentioned compoſition every time ’ it is charged with freſh materials: Before I made uſe oſ this expedient, it was au even chance, in conducting operations in ſtone and earthen retorts,, whether they ' did not crack every time ; by which means great loſs has been ſuſtained. Iſ at any time during the opera-tion the retorts ſhould crack, ſpread fame oſ the oil compoſition thick on the part, and fprinkle feme pow-der of ſiacked lime on it, and it immediately ſtops the ſiffure, and prevents any of the diſtilling matter from pervading ; even that fubtile penetrating ſubſtance the felid phoſphorus will not penetrate through it. It may be applied without any danger, even when the retort is red hot ; and when it is made a little ſtiffer, is more proper for luting veffels than any other I ever have tried ; becaufe if properly mixed it will never crack, nor will it indurate ſo as to endanger the breaking the necks oſ the veffels when taken off.”</p>
