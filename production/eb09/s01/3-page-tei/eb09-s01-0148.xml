Farming and stock-raising occupy the bulk of the population (total, 5700 in 1850, 7816 in 1874), and their wines and oxen are both highly prized. The city of San Marino (1600 inhabitants), formerly reached only by a mule-track but since 1875 by a good carriage-road, is a quaint little place with steep and narrow streets and picturesque but gloomy houses of undressed stone, and containing five churches, a council- hall, an audience chamber, a law court, a little theatre, a museum, and a library. In the centre of the principal square (Pianello) stands a white marble statue of Liberty, presented by the duchess of Acquaviva. At the foot of the city-hill lies the Borgo di San Marino (the commercial centre of the republic); and other municipal villages are Serravalle, Faetano, and Montegiardino, each with remains of its castle and fortifications.</p><p>The republic is governed by a great council <hi rend="italic">(Generale-Consiglio- Principe)</hi> of 60 members (20 nobles, 20 burgesses, 20 rural land- owners) named for life by the council itself. From this body is elected the Council of Twelve, which with the assistance of a legal adviser decides in the third and last resort. Two captains-regent elected every six months (one from the nobles, one from the other two classes) represent the state, which also has its home secretary, its minister of foreign affairs, its chancellor of the exchequer, an army of 950 men, and a regular budget. By treaty with Italy (1872) San Marino, instead of maintaining a customs line of its own, receives a certain proportion of the Italian customs revenue, and, agreeing not to grow tobacco, is allowed to purchase foreign tobacco duty free. To avoid any difficulty about copyright there is no printing press in the republic.</p><p>San Marino derives its name from a certain Dalmatian mason who, along with a comrade immortalized by the neighbouring castle and cathedral of San Leo, settled in this region in the 3d century. The bones of Marinus are said to have been removed to Pavia by the Lombard king Astolphus and restored to the little city on Mount Titanus by Pippin; but the first authentic document proving the existence of the community dates from 885. Situated as a bulwark between the hostile houses of Montefeltro and Malatesta, San Marino fortunately attached itself to the stronger party, which in the 15th century placed its representative on the ducal throne of Urbino. The assistance which it rendered Duke Federigo and his allies, the king of Naples and the pope, against Sigismondo Malatesta was rewarded in 1463 with the castles and territories of Serravalle, Faetano, and Montegiardino. On the annexation of Urbino to the States of the Church (1631), the independence of San Marino was acknowledged; and the unauthorized assertion of papal jurisdiction by Alberoni in 1739 was disallowed by Clement XII. on February 5th 1740. In 1797 Napoleon I. decided to preserve this “échantillon de république;” and in 1854 it was protected from the designs of Pius IX. by the interference of Napoleon III. At the unification of Italy, Cibrario, a citizen in the service of the house of Savoy, helped to secure excellent terms for San Marino.</p><p>See Melchiorre Delfico, <hi rend="italic">Memorie storiche ... di San Marino</hi> ; Marino Fattori, <hi rend="italic">Ricordi storici</hi> .... 1869; Count Bruc, <hi rend="italic">St Marin,</hi> Faris, 1876 ; Bent, <hi rend="italic">A Freak of Freedom,</hi> 1879 ; Casati, <hi rend="italic">La repubblica di San Marino,</hi> Milan, 1881.</p><p>SAN MARTIN DE JOSÉ (1778-1850), Chilian general, was born at Yapeyú, on the Uruguay river, February 25, 1778. In his eighth or ninth year he accompanied his own family to Spain for his education, and being intended for the military profession was admitted into the college of nobles at Madrid. He saw active service and gained distinction in the war of independence, and had risen to the rank of lieutenant-colonel when in 1811 he returned to La Plata. Entering the service of the insurgents there he was entrusted with raising a troop of cavalry, and afterwards was appointed to the chief command of the army acting in Upper Peru against the forces of the viceroy of Lima. After re-establishing his health at Cordova in 1814, he proceeded in 1815 to take command of Cuyo, where he organized an expedition for the liberation of Chili (see vol. v. p. 618). He crossed the mountains early in 1817, and, after gaining a brilliant victory at Chacabuco on 12th February, was pressed by the people of Chili to take the supreme command, and gained a still more brilliant victory at Maypú, 5th April 1818. After organizing the govern</p><p>ment of Chili he sailed with the squadron under Lord Cochrane for Peru, 21st August 1820, and, capturing Lima, drove the Spaniards from the coast and assumed the title of “Protector” of Peru in 1821, but resigned it a year afterwards, and, sailing secretly for Europe, spent the remainder of his life in absolute seclusion near Paris. He died at Boulogne, 17th August 1850.</p><p>See <hi rend="italic">Biographical Sketch</hi> of General San Martin attached to <hi rend="italic">Peruvian Pamphlet, being an exposition of the Administrative Labours of the Peruvian Government,</hi> 1823.</p><p>SANMICHELE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Michele</hi> (1484-1559), one of the ablest architects of his time, learnt the elements of his profession from his father Giovanni and his uncle Bartolommeo, who both practised as architects at Verona with much success. Like almost all the enthusiastic students of that time he went at an early age to Rome to study classic sculpture and architecture. His great talents soon became known, and he designed and carried out a very large number of works at Verona, Venice, and other places. Among his earliest are the duomo of Montefiascone (an octagonal building surmounted with a cupola), the church of San Domenico at Orvieto, and several palaces at both places. He also executed a fine tomb in S. Domenico. @@<hi rend="superscript">1 </hi>He was no less distinguished as a military architect, and was much employed by the signoria of Venice, not only at home, but also in strengthening the fortifications of Corfu, Cyprus, and Candia. @@<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> One of Sanmichele’s most graceful designs is the Cappella de’ Peregrini in the church of S. Bernardino at Verona—square outside and circular within, of the Corinthian order. @@<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> He built a great number of fine palaces at Verona, five of which still exist, as well as the graceful Ponte Nuovo. His last work, begun in 1559, was the round church of the Madonna di Campagna, a mile and a half from Verona on the road to Venice. Like most other distinguished architects of his time he wrote a work on classic architecture, <hi rend="italic">Li Cinque Ordini dell’ Architettura,</hi> printed at Verona in 1735. Sanmichele to some extent followed the earlier style of Brunelleschi; his work is always refined and his detail delicate. His chief pupil was his nephew Bernardino.</p><p>See Ronzani and Luciolli, <hi rend="italic">Fabbriche . ... di M.

His father died during the boyhood of Jacopo, who was accordingly brought up in a very plain way at Nocera Inferiore. He afterwards studied at Naples under Pontanus, when, according to the fashion of the time, he assumed the name Actius Syncerus, by which he is occasionally referred to. After the death of his mother he went abroad,—driven, we are told, by the pangs of despised love for a certain Carmosina, whom he has celebrated in his verse under various names; but of the details of his travels nothing is recorded. On his return he speedily achieved fame as a poet and place as a courtier, receiving from Frederick III. as a country residence the Villa Mergillina near Naples. When his patron was compelled to take refuge in France in 1501 he was accompanied by Sannazaro, who did not return to Italy till after his death (1504). The later years of the poet seem to have been spent at Naples without interruption or memorable incident.
