The other is denominated the <hi rend="italic">Literary Claſs, </hi>and has for its department literature, philology, hiſtory, antiquities, and ſpeculative philoſophy. Every member is deſired at his admiſſion to intimate which of thoſe classes he wiſhes to be more particularly associated with; but he is at the ſame time intitled to attend the meetings of the other claſs, and to take part in all its proceedings. Each of the classes has four presidents and two ſecretaries, who officiate by turns. The meetings of the phyſical claſs are held on the firſt Mondays of January, February, March, April, July, Auguſt, November, and December; and the meetings of the Literary claſs are held on the third Mondays of January, February, March, April, June, July, November, and December, at 7 o’clock afternoon.</p><p>At theſe meetings the written essays and obſervations of the members of the ſociety, or their correpondents, are read publicly, and become the ſubjects of converſation. The ſubjects of theſe essays and observations are announced at a previous meeting, in order to engage the attendance of thoſe members who may be particularly intereſted in them. The author of each dissertation is likewiſe desired to furniſh the ſociety with an abſtract of it, to be read at the next enſuing meeting, when the converſation is renewed with increaſed advantage, from the knowledge previouſiy acquired of the ſubject. At the ſame meetings are exhibited ſuch ſpecimens of natural or artificial curiosities, ſuch remains of antiquity, and ſuch experiments, as are thought worthy of the attention of the ſociety. All objects of natural hiſtory preſented to the ſociety, are ordered by the charter of the inſtitution to be depoſited, on receipt, in the muſeum of the university of Edinburgh ; and all remains oſ antiquity, public records, or ancient manuſcripts, in the library belonging to the faculty of advocates at Edinburgh.</p><p>The ordinary members, whoſe uſual residence is in the city of Edinburgh or its immediate neighbourhood, are expected to attend regularly the monthly meetings ; and are required to defray, by an annual contribution, the current expences of the inſtitution. The members who reſide at ſuch a diſtance from Edinburgh, that  they cannot enjoy the advantages arising from a regular attendance on the meetings of the ſociety, are not ſubjected to any contribution for defraying its expences, but have a right to attend thoſe meetings when occaſionally in Edinburgh, and to take part in all their proceedings.</p><p>Three volumes of the Tranſactions of the ſociety have been publiſhed, which bear simple teſtimony to the learning and acuteness of their various authors.</p><p>3.	<hi rend="italic">Medical Society</hi> of London, inſtituted in the year 1752, on the plan recommended by Lord Bacon <hi rend="italic">(De Augm. Scient.</hi> lib. iv. cap. 2.), to revive the Hippocratic method of composing narratives of particular caſes, in which the nature of the diſeaſe, the manner of treating it, and the conſequences, are to be ſpecified ; to attempt the cure of thoſe diſeaſes which, in his opinion, have been too boldly pronounced incurable ; and, laſt</p><p>ly, to extend their inquiries after the powers of particular medicines in the cure oſ particular caſes ; the collections of this ſociety have been already publiſhed, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Medical Obſervations and Inquiries, </hi>in ſeveral volumes.</p><p>4.	<hi rend="italic">The Medical Society</hi> of Edinburgh was incorporated by royal charter in 1778 ; but there appears to have been in that city a voluntary affectation of the ſame name from the first eſtabliſhment of a regular school of physic in the university. To the voluntary ſociety the public is indebted for six volumes of curious and uſeful essays, collected principally by the late Dr Monro from June 1731 to June 1736; but in the year 1739 that ſociety was united to another, as we have already obſerved in a former article. The ordinary members of the preſent medical ſociety are elected by ballot, and three disſentient exclude a candidate ; an ordinary member may alſo be elected an honorary member, who enjoys the privileges of the others, and receives a diploma, but is freed from the obligation of attendance, delivering papers in rotation, &amp;c. to which the ordinary members are ſubject ; but in this caſe the votes muſt be unanimous. The meetings of this ſociety are held every Saturday evening in their own hall, during the winter ſeaſon, when pipers on medical ſubjects are delivered by the ſeveral members in rotation ; and four of theſe are annually elected to fill the chair in rotation, with the title of annual presidents.</p><p>5.	The <hi rend="italic">Royal Medical Society</hi> of Paris was inſtituted in 1776. The members are divided into associates ordinary, limited to 30, honorary to 12, extraordinary to 60, and foreign to 60, and correspondents. This ſociety has publiſhed ſeveral volumes of Memoirs in 4to .</p><p>6.	Asiatic <hi rend="italic">Society,</hi> an inſtitution planned by the late illuſtrious Sir William Jones, and actually formed at Calcutta on the 15th of January 1784, for the purpoſe of tracing the hiſtory, antiquities, arts, ſciences, and literature, of the immenſe continent of Asia. As it was reſolved to follow as nearly as poſſible the plan of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Royal Society</hi> of London, of which the king is <hi rend="italic">patron,</hi> the patronage of the Asiatic Society was offered to the governor-general and council, as the executive power in the territories of the company. By their acceptance of this offer, Mr Haſtings, as governor-general, appeared among the patrons of the new ſociety ; “ but he ſeemed in his private ſtation as the first liberal promoter of uſeful knowledge in Bengal, and eſpecially as the great encourager of Persian and Shanſcrit literature, to deſerve a particular mark of diſtinction :” he was requeſted, therefore, to accept the honorary title of president. This was handsomely declined in a letter from Mr Haſtings, in which he requeſted " to yield his pretensions to the gentleman whoſe genius planned the inſtitution, and was moſt capable of conducting it to the attainment of the great and ſplendid purpoſes of its formation.” On the receipt of this letter, Sir William Jones was nominated president of the ſociety ; and we cannot give the reader a view of the object of the inſtitution in clearer language than that which he employed in his firſt diſcourſe from the chair.</p><p>It is your design, I conceive (ſaid the president), to take an simple ſpace for your learned inveſtigations, bounding them only by the geographical limits oſ Alia; ſo that, conſidering Hindoſtan as a centre, and turning your eyes in idea to the north, you have on your right</p></body></text></TEI>
