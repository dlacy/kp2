                <p><label>SARDANAPALUS</label>, or Sardanapallus, according to Greek fable, the last
                    king of Assyria, the thirtieth in succession from Ninyas. The name is derived
                    from that of Assur-danin-pal, the rebel son of Shalmaneser H., whose reign ended
                    with the fall of Nineveh in 823 B.c. (or perhaps from that of Assur-dan III.,
                    the last king but one of the older Assyrian dynasty); his character is that
                    ascribed to Assur-bani-pal. He was the most effeminate and corrupt of a line of
                    effeminate princes; hence Arbaces, satrap of Media, rebelled and, with the help
                    of Belesys, the Babylonian priest, besieged Nineveh. Sardanapalus now threw off
                    his sloth and for two years the issue was doubtful. Then, the Tigris having
                    undermined part of the city wall, he collected his wives and treasures and
                    burned them with himself in his palace (880 b.c.). His fate is an echo of that
                    of Samas-sum-yukin, the brother of Assur-bani-pal <hi rend="italic"
