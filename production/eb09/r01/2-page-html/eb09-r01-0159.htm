<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">upsetting each others’ facts without supplying fresh details of an authentic character. It is commonly said that the&nbsp;poet, finding Joyeuse an inactive or unwilling patron, transferred his services to Philippe de Bethune, Sully’s brother,&nbsp;who went as ambassador to Rome in 1601 ; but this seems&nbsp;doubtful, for one of the very few positive documents concerning Régnier speaks of him as still in Joyeuse’s service&nbsp;a year later. What is generally certain is that during the&nbsp;greater part of his youth he lived partly in Paris and partly&nbsp;in Italy, after a somewhat idle and very dissipated fashion.&nbsp;He early began the practice of satirical writing, and the&nbsp;enmity which existed between his uncle Desportes and the j&nbsp;poet Malherbe gave him occasion to attack the latter in&nbsp;some of his very best verses. It has been generally said that&nbsp;Regnier obtained full possession of a canonry at Chartres, to&nbsp;the reversion of which he had been appointed when a child,&nbsp;in 1604, and a singular legend is told of the immediate&nbsp;circumstances ; but the formal registry of admission signed&nbsp;by himself is extant, and is dated 1609, a further instance&nbsp;of the uncertainty which prevails respecting him. In 1606&nbsp;Desportes died, leaving nothing to Regnier, though they&nbsp;seem to have been on excellent terms to the last. The&nbsp;poet was even disappointed of the succession to Desportes’s&nbsp;abbacies, but he obtained a pension (the amount as usual&nbsp;variously stated at 2000 and 6000 livres) chargeable upon&nbsp;one of them, by the influence of the Marquis de Cœuvres,&nbsp;afterwards Maréchal d’Estrées, the brother of Henry IV.’s&nbsp;Gabrielle. He also became a great favourite with his&nbsp;bishop, Philippe Hurault, at whose abbacy of Royaumont&nbsp;Regnier spent much time in the later years of his life.&nbsp;On the other hand the death of Henry IV. deprived him&nbsp;of his last hope of great preferments, and appears to have&nbsp;considerably soured his temper. He did not long survive&nbsp;the king. His life had always been one of dissipation, or, to&nbsp;speak frankly, debauchery, and in the autumn of 1613 he&nbsp;went to Rouen to put himself under the care of a quack&nbsp;doctor. An apparent cure was followed by a feast at&nbsp;which the patient drank his physician’s health too freely&nbsp;in strong Spanish wine, and died of pleurisy or fever at&nbsp;his hotel, the Écu d’Orléans, on the 13th October. His&nbsp;body was disembowelled and the entrails deposited in the&nbsp;parish church, that of St Marie Mineure, the other remains&nbsp;being carried to Royaumont and buried there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Such is the meagre amount of positive knowledge respecting one of the greatest poets of France. Nor can it be said that llegnier’s&nbsp;literary history is quite accurately ascertained, though it is less&nbsp;dubious than his personal. The period immediately preceding&nbsp;and following his death was a period of numerous collections of&nbsp;licentious and satirical poems, some published, some still remaining&nbsp;in manuscript. Gathered from these there has been a floating mass&nbsp;of epigrams, &amp;c., attributed to llegnier, few of which are certainly&nbsp;authentic, and most of which do no particular credit to his memory.&nbsp;On these editors of his works have exercised freely the light of&nbsp;acceptance or rejection, so that it is very rare to find two editions&nbsp;of Regnier which exactly agree in contents. His acknowledged or&nbsp;undoubted work, however, is that on which his fame rests, and it&nbsp;falls into three classes :—regular satires in alexandrine couplets,&nbsp;serious poems in various metres, and satirical or jocular epigrams&nbsp;and light pieces, which often, if not always, exhibit considerable&nbsp;licence of language. This latter class is, however, much the least&nbsp;important in every way. The real greatness of Regnier consists in&nbsp;the vigour and polish of his satires, contrasted and heightened as&nbsp;that vigour is with the exquisite feeling and melancholy music of&nbsp;some of his minor poems. In the latter Regnier is a disciple of&nbsp;Ronsard (whom he defended brilliantly against Malherbe), without&nbsp;the occasional pedantry, the affectation, or the undue fluency of the&nbsp;Pléiade, but in the satires he had hardly any master (Vauquelin&nbsp;de la Fresnaye and Agrippa d’Aubigné, who preceded him in point&nbsp;of composition, did not publish their satires until later) except the&nbsp;ancients. He has sometimes followed Horace closely, hut always&nbsp;in an entirely original spirit. His vocabulary is varied and&nbsp;picturesque, but is not marred by the maladroit classicism of some&nbsp;of the Ronsardists. His verse is extraordinarily forcible and&nbsp;nervous, but what distinguishes him especially from most&nbsp;satirists is the way in which he gets the better of what may be&nbsp;called the commonplaces of satire, and to a great extent at any</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">rate avoids the tendency of all French poetry to run into types. His keen and accurate knowledge of human nature and even his&nbsp;purely literary qualities extorted the admiration of Boileau—&nbsp;usually the severest of critics in regard to all poets of the ¡!receding&nbsp;age except Malherbe. Regnier, moreover, in respect of !Malherbe&nbsp;has himself displayed remarkable independence and acuteness of&nbsp;literary criticism, and the famous passage in which he satirizes the&nbsp;poet of Caen contains the best denunciation of the merely “ correct ”&nbsp;theory of poetry that has ever been written. Lastly, Regnier had a&nbsp;most unusual descriptive faculty, and the vividness of what may be&nbsp;called his narrative satires was not approached in France for at&nbsp;least two centuries after his death. All his merits are displayed in&nbsp;the masterpiece entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Macctte ou VHypocrisie déconcertée</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, but&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> hardly any one of the sixteen satires which he has left falls below&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">j </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">even a very high standard. In general it may bo said that Regnier&nbsp;is the last poet who shows the poetic faculties of the French tongue&nbsp;before the classical reforms of the 17tli century had cramped and&nbsp;curtailed them, and that he shows these faculties in something like&nbsp;perfection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first edition of Regniei’s satires appeared in 1G08 published by Gabriel Bnon. There was another in 1609, and another in 1012. The author had also&nbsp;contributed to two collection</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">.·.—Les Muses Gaillardes</span><span class="font1"> in 1009 and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Le Temple&nbsp;d'Apollon</span><span class="font1"> in 1611. In the year of hi* death (1613) a completer collection&nbsp;appeared, and another in 1610. The chief editions of the 18th ci ntnry are that of&nbsp;Urossette (1729), which supplies the standard commentary on Regifur, and that of&nbsp;Lenglet Dufresnoy (1733). Recently the poet has been frequently and carefully&nbsp;reprinted. The editions of Prosper Poitevin in I860, of M. de Barthélemy in 1862,&nbsp;and of M. Courbet in 1875 may be specially mentioned. The last, printed after the&nbsp;originals in italic type, and well edited, is perhaps the best, as M. de Barthélémy’*&nbsp;is the tullest, of recent copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REGULUS, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Marcus Atilius, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">was consul for the second time in the ninth year of the First Punic War (256 b.c.), and&nbsp;so was one of the commanders in the great naval expedition which shattered the Carthaginian fleet and successfully lauded an army on Carthaginian territory at Clupea.&nbsp;At first the invaders had such success that half the army&nbsp;and the other consul Manlius could be recalled to Rome,&nbsp;and yet leave good hope that Regulus with the insurgent&nbsp;Numidian subjects of the Phoenicians would finish the&nbsp;war in the second campaign. But Carthage, which had&nbsp;found an able general in the Spartan Xanthippus, used the&nbsp;I winter to such good account that in the spring of 255&nbsp;Regulus was decidedly inferior in strength, and, hazarding&nbsp;a pitched battle on ground favourable to the enemy, had&nbsp;his army cut to pieces and was hitnself taken captive.&nbsp;Regulus perished in captivity, and was supposed at Rome&nbsp;to have been done to death : according to the common story&nbsp;he was sent to Rome on parole to negotiate a peace or exchange of prisoners, but on his arrival strongly urged the&nbsp;senate to refuse both proposals, and returning to Carthage&nbsp;was slain with horrid tortures. This is the story so eloquently told by Horace (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Carvi</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">. iii. 5), and which made&nbsp;Regulus to the later Romans the type of heroic endurance&nbsp;in misfortune ; but most critical historians regard it as&nbsp;i insufficiently attested, Polybius being silent.</span></p>

He&nbsp;! studied hard, and began to compose at a very early age,—&nbsp;producing, during the course of a long and active life, a&nbsp;vast quantity of church music, five operas, a number of&nbsp;symphonies, oratorios, and many miscellaneous works.&nbsp;Though clever and ingenious, his compositions are more&nbsp;remarkable for their novelty than for the beauty of the&nbsp;ideas upon which they are based, and display but little of&nbsp;the divine fire which alone can render works of art&nbsp;immortal.
