        <p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Use of the Rifle in War.— </span><span
                class="font0">The study of “ musketry ” as&nbsp;distinct from target shooting
                may&nbsp;be said to date from the Franco-German War. Previously military students
                and practical&nbsp;soldiers concerned themselves&nbsp;rather with the tactical
                question&nbsp;of fire-power—fire </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">versus</span><span class="font0"> shock,&nbsp;bullet
                </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">versus</span><span
                class="font0"> bayonet and so on—</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">than with the technical question of its application. This was natural
                enough in the days of short-range fighting. But&nbsp;when bullets began to cause
                losses at 1000 yds. and more&nbsp;from the firing point, formations that presented
                the least&nbsp;vulnerable target had to be discovered and tested, aiming&nbsp;grew
                more difficult as the range increased, and firing by&nbsp;word of command in large
                units became practically impossible. The very accuracy and range of modern
                weapons&nbsp;involved new problems. The necessity, in the larger area
                of&nbsp;effective fire, of setting the sights to the distance of the mark&nbsp;made
                further demands on fire-discipline and brought up the&nbsp;difficult problem of
                judging distance. The possibilities of&nbsp;varying the rate of fire conferred by
                the magazine rifle also&nbsp;demanded close study. Each war, as it came, produced
                fresh&nbsp;evidence as to what was possible and what was not in matters&nbsp;of
                fire-control, the best rate of fire for effect, the range at&nbsp;which fire should
                be opened, and other half-tactical, half-technical problems. Thus, although many
                points still remain&nbsp;in the region of controversy, certain ideas and
                principles&nbsp;are almost universally accepted as the basis of
                service&nbsp;musketry.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The leading idea is that of the “ cone of dispersion.” A modern
                rifle, even fired from a fixed rest under good conditions,&nbsp;will not place shot
                after shot in the same spot, but the shot-marks on the target form a more or less
                close “ group.” When&nbsp;to this error of the rifle and the ammunition there is
                added&nbsp;the personal error of the marksman, the group is larger, and in&nbsp;the
                collective fire of a squad it is larger still. Now the trajectories&nbsp;of bullets
                that do not strike in the same place naturally do&nbsp;not coincide, and the group
                on the target is represented in&nbsp;the air by a cone or sheaf of trajectories. The
                bullets of this&nbsp;sheaf striking the ground on either side of the target
                form&nbsp;on the ground a much elongated ellipse. The ellipse containing&nbsp;90 %
                of the bullets fired is called the </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">beaten zone.</span><span class="font0"> It is&nbsp;usual,
                however, to calculate from the “ effective ” zone, or that&nbsp;which contains 75%
                of bullets. Within the “effective” zone,&nbsp;and at its centre, is found the
                closely grouped “ nucleus ” of</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The target aimed at and sighted for is at the centre of the zone (see
                fig. 19). The height of the grouping on a vertical&nbsp;target compared to the depth
                of the grouping on the ground&nbsp;is of course proportionate to the tangent of the
                angle of descent;&nbsp;hence, small as is the group on a vertical target at 500
                yds.,&nbsp;the beaten zone is no less than 320 yds. deep. For the same&nbsp;reason,
                as the range, and consequently the angle of descent,&nbsp;increases, the beaten zone
                diminishes in depth. Another&nbsp;factor is the “ dangerous space.” This is the
                space between&nbsp;“ first catch,” </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> the point at which the
                bullet (in a sheaf,&nbsp;the lowest bullet) comes low enough to catch a man’s head,
                and“ first graze,” that at which it strikes the ground. The extent&nbsp;of this
                dangerous space varies of course with the height of the&nbsp;man’s head. In the case
                of a mounted man, at 1000 yds.,&nbsp;it is 105 yds., while in that of a sharpshooter
                lying down, it is&nbsp;only 13 yds. (in addition of course to the beaten
                zone).&nbsp;As nowadays nearly all targets, on service, are lying or three-quarters
                concealed figures, the dangerous space as compared&nbsp;with the beaten zone is at
                such .a range too small to count&nbsp;as a factor. It is, however, important at
                shorter ranges, 500&nbsp;yds. and under (700 and under with the new pointed
                bullets).&nbsp;Here the advantages of flat trajectory make themselves
                felt.&nbsp;Within this distance the bullet is at no point in its career&nbsp;too
                high to be dangerous to a standing man or a horseman.&nbsp;A lying figure is in
                danger at any distance beyond 350 yds.&nbsp;if the sights are set to 500 yds. (front
                half of effective zone&nbsp;no yds., dangerous space 52 yds.). This is the theory
                underlying the 500 yds. “ fixed sight ” or “ battle-sight,” a setting&nbsp;which
                holds good for all less ranges, and can be put on the&nbsp;rifle instantly and
                without looking at the back-sight graduations.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">These facts, taken in conjunction with the imperfections of the most
                skilful individual marksmanship and the chances&nbsp;of wrong estimation of
                distance, are the basis of the musketry&nbsp;training and practice of to-day. At the
                School of Musketry,&nbsp;Hythe, the standard of judging distance is “ not more
                than</span></p><div>
