<p><span class="font0">genius, seized his opportunity. Leaving Edward, now his only brother in blood and almost his equal in arms, in Galloway,&nbsp;he suddenly transferred his own operations to Aberdeenshire.&nbsp;He overran Buchan either once or twice, and after a serious&nbsp;illness defeated the earl of Buchan, one of his chief Scottish&nbsp;opponents, near Inverurie on the 22nd of May 1308. Then&nbsp;crossing to Argyllshire he surprised another body of his enemies&nbsp;in the pass of Brander early in 1309, took Dunstaffnage, and&nbsp;in March of this year held his first parliament at St Andrews.&nbsp;In 1309 a truce scarcely kept was effected by Pope Clement V.&nbsp;and Philip IV. of France, and in 1310, in a general council at&nbsp;Dundee, the clergy of Scotland, all the bishops being present,&nbsp;recognized Bruce as king. The support given to him by the&nbsp;national church in spite of his excommunication must have&nbsp;been of great importance in that age, and was probably due to&nbsp;the example of Lamberton. The next three years was signalized by the reduction one by one of the strong places still&nbsp;held by the English: Linlithgow towards the end of 1310,&nbsp;Dumbarton in October 1311, Perth, by Bruce himself, in January&nbsp;1312. Previous to these two latter successes the king had&nbsp;made two raids into the north of England; after which Buittle,&nbsp;Dalsvrinton and Dumfries were reduced, and Berwick was&nbsp;threatened. In March 1313 his lieutenant Sir James Douglas&nbsp;surprised Roxburgh, and Thomas Randolph surprised Edinburgh. In May Bruce was again in England, and though he&nbsp;failed to take Carlisle, he subdued the IsIe of Man. About the&nbsp;same time Edward Bruce took Rutherglen and laid siege to&nbsp;Stirling, whose governor, Sir Philip de Mowbray, agreed to&nbsp;capitulate if not relieved before the 24th of June 1314.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Bruce<sup>i</sup>S rapidity of movement was one cause of his success. His sieges, the most difficult part of medieval warfare, though&nbsp;won sometimes by stratagem, prove that he and his follower's&nbsp;had benefited from their early training in the wars of Edward I.&nbsp;We know that he had been employed by that king to prepare&nbsp;the siege-train for his attack on Stirhng in 1304. By the close&nbsp;of 1313 Berwick, Stirling and BothvvelI alone remained English.&nbsp;Edward II. felt that if Scotland was not to be lost a great effort&nbsp;must be made. With the whole available feudal levy of&nbsp;England, and a contingent from Ireland, he advanced from&nbsp;Berwick to Falkirk, which he reached on the 22nd of June&nbsp;1314. After a preliminary skirmish on Sunday the 23rd, in&nbsp;which Bruce distinguished himself by a personal combat with&nbsp;Sir Henry de Bohun, whom he felled by a single blow of his&nbsp;axe, the battle of Bannockbum was fought on Monday the&nbsp;24th; and the complete rout of the English determined the&nbsp;independence of Scotland and confirmed the title of Bruce.&nbsp;The details of the day, memorable in the history of war as well&nbsp;as of Scotland, have been singularly well preserved, and redound to the credit of Bmce, who bad studied in the school&nbsp;of Wallace as well as in that of Edward I. He had chosen and&nbsp;knew his ground, lying between St Ninians and the Bannock,&nbsp;a petty bum, yet sufficient to produce marshes dangerous to&nbsp;heavily armed horsemen, while from the rising ground on his&nbsp;right the enemy’s advance was seen. His troops were in four&nbsp;divisions: bis brother Edward commanded the right, Randolph&nbsp;the centre, Douglas the left. Bruce with the reserve planted&nbsp;his standard at the Bore Stone, whence there is the best view&nbsp;of the field. His camp-followers on the Gillies<sup>i</sup> Hill appeared&nbsp;over its crest at the critical moment which comes in all battles.&nbsp;The plain on the right of the marshes was prepared with pits&nbsp;and spikes. But what more than any other point of strategy&nbsp;made the fight famous was that the Scots fought on foot in&nbsp;battalions with their spears outwards, in a circular formation&nbsp;serving the same purpose as the modem square. A momentary&nbsp;success of the English archers was quickly reversed by a flank&nbsp;movement on the part of Sir Robert Keith. The Scottish&nbsp;bowmen followed up this advantage, and the fight became&nbsp;general; the English horse, crowded into too narrow a space,&nbsp;were met by the steady resistance of the Scottish pikemen,&nbsp;who knew, as Bruce had told them truly, that they fought for&nbsp;their country, their wives, their children, and all that freemen&nbsp;hold dear. The English rear Was either unable to come up in&nbsp;the narrow space, or got entangled in the broken ranks of the&nbsp;van. The first repulse soon passed into a rout, and from a&nbsp;rout into a headlong flight, in which the English king himself&nbsp;barely escaped. In the career of Brucc, Bannockburn was the&nbsp;turning-point. The enthusiasm of the nation he had saved&nbsp;forgot his tardy adhesion to the popular cause, and at the&nbsp;parliament of Ayr on the 25th of April 1315 the succession&nbsp;was settled by a unanimous voice on him, and, failing males&nbsp;of his body, on his brother Edward and his heirs male, or failing&nbsp;them on his daughter Marjorie and her heirs, if she married&nbsp;with his consent. Soon afterwards she married Walter the&nbsp;steward (d. 1326). As a result of Bannockburn, Bruce’s queen&nbsp;was restored to her husband; Stirling was delivered up to the&nbsp;Scots; the north of England was ravaged, and Carlisle and&nbsp;Berwick were besieged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The last part of Bruce<sup>i</sup>S life, from 1315 to 1329, began with an attempt which was the most striking testimony that could&nbsp;have been given to the effect of Bannockburn, and which,&nbsp;had it succeeded, might have altered the future of the British&nbsp;Isles. This was no less than the rising of the whole Celtic race,&nbsp;who had felt the galling yoke of Edward I. and envied the&nbsp;freedom the Scots had won. In 1315 Edward Bruce crossed to&nbsp;Ireland on the invitation of the natives, and in the following&nbsp;year the Welsh became his allies. In the autumn of 1316&nbsp;Robert came to his brother, and together they traversed Ireland&nbsp;to Limerick. Dublin was saved by its inhabitants committing&nbsp;it to the flames, and, though nineteen victories were won, of&nbsp;which that at Slane in Louth by Robert was. counted the chief,&nbsp;the success was too rapid to be permanent. The brothers&nbsp;retreated to Ulster, and, Robert having left Ireland in May&nbsp;1317 to protect his own borders, Edward, who had been crowned&nbsp;king of Ireland, was defeated and killed at Dundalk in October&nbsp;1318. On his return Bruce addressed himself to the siege of&nbsp;Berwick, a standing menace to Scotland. While he was preparing&nbsp;for it two cardinals arrived in England with a mission from&nbsp;Pope John XXII. to effect a truce, or, failing that, to renew&nbsp;the excommunication of Bruce. The cardinals did not trust&nbsp;themselves across the border; their messengers, however, were&nbsp;courteously received by Bmcc, but with a firm refusal to admit&nbsp;the papal bulls into his kingdom because not addressed to him&nbsp;as king. Another attempt by Adam Newton, guardian of the&nbsp;Friars Minorite at Berwick, had a more ignominious result.&nbsp;Bruce admitted Newton to his presence at Aldcamus or Old&nbsp;Cambus, and informed him that he would not receive the bulls&nbsp;until his title was acknowledged and he had taken Berwick.&nbsp;On his return Newton was waylaid and his papers seized, not&nbsp;without suspicion of Bruce’s connivance. In March 1318 the&nbsp;town and soon afterwards the castle of Berwick capitulated,&nbsp;and Bmce wasted the English border as far as Ripon. In&nbsp;December he held a parliament at Scone, where he displayed&nbsp;the same wisdom as a legislator which he had shown as a general.&nbsp;The death of his brother and his daughter rendered a resettlement of the crown advisable, and it was settled on his grandson,&nbsp;Robert, son of Marjorie and Walter the steward, in case Bmce&nbsp;died without sons, with a provision as to the regency in case&nbsp;of a minor heir in favour of Randolph. The defence of the&nbsp;country was next cared for by regulations for the arming of the&nbsp;whole nation, down to every one who owned the value of a cow,&nbsp;a measure far in advance of the old feudal levy. Exports&nbsp;during war, and of arms at any time, were prohibited. Internal&nbsp;justice was regulated, and it was declared that it was to be done&nbsp;to poor and rich alike. Leasing-making—a Scottish term for&nbsp;seditious language—was to be StemIy punished. The nobles&nbsp;were exhorted not to oppress the commons. Reforms were also&nbsp;made in the tedious technicalities of the feudal law. In September 1319 an attempt to recover Berwick was repelled by&nbsp;Walter the steward,’and Bmce took occasion of a visit to compliment his son-in-law and raise the walls 10 ft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The king’s position was now so strong that foreign states began to testify their respect. Bruges and Ypres rejected a&nbsp;request of Edward II. to cut off the Scottish trade with Flanders'.&nbsp;Pope John, who had excommunicated Bruce, was addressed</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
