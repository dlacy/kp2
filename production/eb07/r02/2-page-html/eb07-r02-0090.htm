<p><span class="font1">of the death of Tristram’s elder brother, enforced by the eloquent stroke of dropping the hat, as if a lump of clay&nbsp;had been kneaded into the crown of it. There is nothing&nbsp;sneering, nothing unkindly, nothing that revolts the better&nbsp;feelings in his playful irony. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Circum prœcordia ludU.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">That of Swift and Voltaire is blighting like an east wind;&nbsp;the sympathies of the heart close themselves up against it;&nbsp;but beneath the genial and balmy humour of Cervantes&nbsp;and Sterne, they relax and blow like flowers expanding beneath the west wind in spring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The wonderful resources of characteristic invention, and the very finest perception of the limits of true humour, are&nbsp;shown in the contrasted characters of the two brothers, the&nbsp;main personages in the history ; the man of pure intellect,&nbsp;restless, nervous, eloquent, hair-splitting, half-crazed by&nbsp;learned theories, which he insists on carrying into action,&nbsp;craving sympathy, and yet courting discussion, as delineated in the elder Shandy ; and the man of pure good&nbsp;nature and benevolence, as drawn in Toby; without learning, with no head for reasoning, but with a heart always&nbsp;in the right place ; eloquent too, in his way, when his feelings are touched, or his favourite pursuits depreciated, (witness his animated and beautiful defence of his reasons for&nbsp;prolonging the war) chaste as a woman, gentle, harmless&nbsp;and credulous as a child ; riding his hobby, in short, in so&nbsp;captivating a manner, that, if the truth were told, most of&nbsp;his readers are in their hearts inclined to mount along with&nbsp;him. There are few, we suppose, who have not been seduced into something of his own mania by the scene&nbsp;on the bowling green, when he discovers the ingenious invention by which Trim, having converted the jack-boots into mortars, is directing a hot fire from these engines&nbsp;against the counterscarp of Lisle ; when the tobacco pipes,&nbsp;withdrawn from the mouth of the corporal, are gradually&nbsp;insinuated into his own, merely to try them ; and puff&nbsp;succeeds puff, till the enthusiast is swept into the torrent of&nbsp;a furious cannonade. Nothing, too, can be at once more&nbsp;humourous or characteristic than that scene where Toby&nbsp;mistakes the elder Shandy’s quotation from Sulpicius’ consolatory letter to Cicero, for a real account of his brother’s trip&nbsp;to the Levant, a stroke of humour so natural in tlle circumstances, and yet so original, that it would of itself be sufficient to prove that Sterne was a man of genius.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The two great defects of Sterne, as noticed by Sir Walter Scott, are his affectation and his indefensible indecency.&nbsp;For his plagiarisms from other authors, we regard as of little importance. So ingeniously are they turned to account,&nbsp;and so much in general does Sterne improve what he borrows, that he may fairly claim in them tllat right of property&nbsp;which the civil law allowed in articles where the labour bestowed by the borrower exceeded the intrinsic value of the&nbsp;material on which it was bestowed. It must be confessed,&nbsp;however, that few writers have carried their coolness and&nbsp;assurance in this respect so far as Sterne has done, who, not&nbsp;content with denouncing the plagiarisms of authors, has actually stolen from Burton the passage in which he exposes&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">tlle </span><span class="font1">iniquities of his neighbours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But the other objections less admit of defence. The affectation of Sterne is the more to be regretted, because his manner in its happiest moods is the very perfection of a&nbsp;lively, spirited, spoken style, idiomatic, imaginative, pliant,&nbsp;and varied. “ Writing, when properly managed,” he himself observes, “ is but a different name for conversation.”&nbsp;Unfortunately he did not always conform his practice to his&nbsp;precept. He is sometimes </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fade</span><span class="font1"> in his sentimentality, and&nbsp;aiming after a sort of false sublime in his imagery. Some&nbsp;portions of the story of Maria are examples of the first ; the&nbsp;well-known personification of the recording angel in tlle&nbsp;close of Le Fevre, is an instance of the second. Still more&nbsp;unw'orthy of Sterne are those quackeries of the black page&nbsp;and the white one, the sudden transitions and affected openings of the chapters, with other harlequinades of authorship,&nbsp;which are carried to excess in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tristram Shandy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The indecency of Sterne is more obtrusive and indefensible than that of either Fielding or Smollett ; whose highly-coloured scenes seem to be the result of an unchecked imagination, running on heedless whether its course lie through purity or filth. Sterne, on the other hand, goes coldly and&nbsp;deliberately in search of impurity ; seeks for it in books,&nbsp;refines upon it, mixes it up with his reflections, and is&nbsp;continually insinuating some equivoque or double entendre into scenes where we can ill bear with such adulteration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Richardson, Fielding, Smollett, and Sterne, are the four great novelists of this period (the reign of George II.) which&nbsp;was pre-eminently the age of novel-writing in England. For&nbsp;though we should indeed be sorry to undervalue the merits&nbsp;of Goldsmith, or the charm of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vicar of Wakefield,</span><span class="font1"> we&nbsp;cannot quite rank the powers displayed in that delightful little&nbsp;tale, which appeared in 1763, so highly as the varied invention displayed by </span><span class="font0">tlle </span><span class="font1">writers we have named, upon the&nbsp;broader canvass which they selected. To use his own&nbsp;words, it has many faults, and a hundred things might plausibly be said to prove them beauties. Fortunately, they lie&nbsp;more in the minor parts, than in the essentials of tlle tale. In&nbsp;fact, the improbability ofthe plot is only equalled by the wonderful truth, nature and keeping of the principal character, for&nbsp;the “limæ labor” which, in tllis instance, Goldsmith willingly&nbsp;bestowed upon his style, and on the creation and apposition&nbsp;of traits of character, be scrupled to waste upon the selection&nbsp;of his incidents. The real interest lies in the development&nbsp;in the character of the amiable Vicar, so rich in heavenly,&nbsp;so poor in earthly wisdom ;—possessing little for himself, yet&nbsp;ready to make that little less, whenever misery appeals to&nbsp;his compassion ;—with enough of literary vanity about him&nbsp;to shew that he shares the weaknesses of our nature,—ready&nbsp;to be imposed upon by cosmogonies and fictitious bills of&nbsp;exchange, and yet commanding, by the simple and serene&nbsp;dignity of goodness, the respect even of the profligate, and&nbsp;making “ those who came to mock remain to pray.” Doubtless, the probability and look of life which a character drawn&nbsp;with such quiet strokes of the pencil, and with such sobriety&nbsp;of colouring, possesses, is in some measure owing to the fact,&nbsp;that not a few ofthe incidents of which Goldsmith has availed&nbsp;himself, are drawn from circumstances in his personal history,&nbsp;such as the mistakeof setting out to teach the French English,&nbsp;without recollecting that it was a necessary preliminary for&nbsp;the tutor to acquire a little French himself; but the skill&nbsp;which can make such trifles in real life subservient to the&nbsp;purposes of real fiction, is scarcely less worthy of praise&nbsp;than would have been their original invention. Perhaps&nbsp;there is no better proof of the broad and general truth of&nbsp;delineation which a novel possesses, than our being in the&nbsp;habit of resorting to it in conversation for cases in point, and&nbsp;comic illustrations of our opinions. In this respect the Fleer </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of Wahefleld</span><span class="font1"> forms a storehouse of allusion. How naturally does any ridiculous investment in Mexican mines,&nbsp;or Spanish stock, recall to our recollection Moses’ bargain&nbsp;for the gross of green spectacles ? Who is there that has&nbsp;not been reminded of the aristocratic Miss Skeggs turning&nbsp;out to be no better than she should be, notwithstanding her&nbsp;intimacy with the Duchess, and her taste for Shakspeare&nbsp;and the musical glasses, by some case of the same kind&nbsp;within our own experience, where, reversing the denouement&nbsp;of the Double Arrangement, the Knight Templar of the company has sunk into the waiter ? And for our ow n part, we must&nbsp;admit, that we have never been able to treat with due gravity&nbsp;any allusion to the learned speculations of Manetho, Be-rosus, or Sanconiathon, from their indissoluble connexion in&nbsp;our minds with the more finished cosmogony of Jenkinson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In one respect Goldsmith rises conspicuously superior to his brethren ; he has no passages, which, dying, he need have</span></p>
