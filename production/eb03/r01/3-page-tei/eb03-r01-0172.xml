An army or body of men are ſaid to retreat when they turn their backs upon the enemy, or are retiring from the ground they occupied : hence every march in withdrawing from the enemy is called a <hi rend="italic">retreat.</hi></p><p>That which is done in fight of an aélive enemy, who purſues with a ſuperior force, is the moil important part of the ſubject; and is, with reaſon, looked upon as the Ulory of theproſeſſion. It is a manœuvre the moſt delicate, and the propereſt to diſplay the prudence, genius, courage, and addrefs, of an officer who commands: the hiſto-rians of all ages teſtify it ; and hiſtorians have never been ſo laviſh of eulogiums as on the ſubject of the brilliant retreats of our heroes. If it is important, it is no leſs difficult to regulate, on account of the variety of circumſtances, each of which demands different prin-ciples, and an almoſt endlefs detail. Hence a good retreat is eſteemed, by experienced officers, the maſter-pieee of a general. He ſhould therefore be well ac-quainted with the fituation of the country<hi rend="sub">-</hi> through which he intends to make it, and careful that nothing is omitted to make it ſafe and honourable. See WAR.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Retreat, is alſo a beat of the drum, at the firing of the evening gun ; at which the drum-major, with all the drums of the battalion, except ſuch as are upon du-ty, beats from the camp-colours on the right to thoſe on the leſt, on the parade of encampment : the drums of all the guards beat alſo ; the trumpets at the ſame time founding at the head of their refpective troops. This is to warn the ſoldiers to forbear firing, and the centinels to challenge, till the break of day that the reveille is beat. The retreat islikewiſe called </hi><hi rend="italic">ſetting the watch.</hi></p><p>RETRENCHMENT literally fignifies ſomething -cut off or taken from a thing ; in which fenſe it is the ſame with ſubtraction, diminution, &amp;c.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Retrenchment, in the art of war, any kind oſ work raiſed to cover a poll, and fortify it againſt the .enemy, ſuch as ſaſcines loaded with earth, gambions, barrels of earth, ſand-bags, and generally all things that can cover the men and ſtop the enemy. See For-tification and WAR.</hi></p><p>RETRIBUTION, a handſome preſent, gratuity, or acknowledgment, given inſtead of a formal ſalary or hire, to perſons employed in affairs that do not ſo im-mediately fall under eſtimation, nor within the ordinary commerce in money.</p><p>RETROMINGENTS, in natural hiſtory, a claſs or diviſion of animals, whoſe characteriſtic is, that they ſtale or make water backwards, both male and female.</p><p>RETURN <hi rend="italic">(returna</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">retorna),</hi>  in law, is uſed in divers ſenſes. ι. Return of writs by ſheriffs and bailiffs is a certificate made by them to the court, of what they have done in relation to the execution of the writ directed to them. This is wrote on the back of the writ by the officer, who thus fends the writ back to the court from whence it iffued, in order that it may be filed. 2. Return oſ a commiſſion, is a certificate or anſwer ſent to the court from whence the commiſſion iffues, concerning what has been done by the commiſ-ſioners. 3. Returns, or days in bank, are certain days in each term, appointed for the return of writs, &amp;c. Thus Hillary term has four returns, viz. in the king’s-</p><lb/><p>bench, on the day next after the octave, or eighth day after Hillary day : on the day next after the fifteenth day from St Hillary; on the day after purification} and on the next after the octave of the purification. In the common pleas, in eight days of St Hillary : from the day of St Hillary, in fifteen days : on the day after the purification : in eight days of the purification. Eaſter term has five returns, viz. in the king’s-bench, on the day next after the fifteenth day from Eaſter : on the day next after the three weeks from Eafter : on the day next after one month from Eaſter : on the day next after five weeks from Eaſter: and on the day next alter the day following aſcenſton-day. In the common pleas, in fifteen days from the feaſt of Eaſter : in three weeks from the feaſt of Eaſter : in one month ſrom Eaſter day : in five weeks from Eaſter day : on the day after the aſcenſton-day. Trinity term has four re-turns, viz. on the day following the ſecond day after Trinity : on the day following the eighth’day after Trinity : on the day next after the fifteenth day from Tri-nity : on the day next after three weeks from Trinity. In the common pleas, on the day after Trinity : in eight days of Trinity: in fifteen days from Trinity : in three weeks from Trinity. Michaelmas term has fix returns, viz. on the day next after three weeks from St Michael : on the day next after one month of St Michael: on the day following'the ſecond day after All-fouls : on the day next after the ſecond day after St Martin : on the day following the octave of St Martin : on the day next after fifteen days of St Martin. In the common pleas, in three weeks from St Michael : in one month from St Michael : on the day after AU-ſouls : on the day after St Martin : on the octave of St Martin : in fifteen days from St Martin. It is to be obferved, that, as in the king’s-bench, all returns are to be made on ſome particular day of the week in each term, care muſt be taken not to make the writs out of that court returnable on a non-judicial day ; ſuch as Sunday, and All-faints, in Michaelmas term, the purification in Hillary, the afeenfion in Eaſter, and Midſummer-day, except it ſhould fall on thc firſt day of Trinity term.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Returns, in a military ſenſe, are of various forts, but all tending to explain the ſtate of the army, regiment, or company ; namely, how many capable of doing duty, on duty, fick in quarters, barracks, infirmary, or hoſpital ; priſoners, abſent with or without leave ; total effective ; wanting to complete the eſtabliſhment, &amp;c.</hi></p><p>RETUSARI, an ifland in Ruſſia, is a long ſiip of land, or rather ſand, through the middle of which runs a ridge of granite. It is 20 miles from Peterſhurg by water, four from the ſhore of Ingria, and nine from the coaft of Carelia. It is about 10 miles in circumference, and was overſpread with firs and pines rvhen Pe-ter firſt conquered it ſrom the Swedes. It contains at preſent about 3c,000 inhabitants, including the ſailors and garrifon, the former of whom amount to about 12,000, the latter to 1500 men. The iſiand affords a ſmall quantity of paſture, produces vegetables, and a few fruits, ſuch as apples, currants, gooſeberries, and ſtraw-. berries, which thrive in this northern climate.</p><p>RETZ (Cardinal de).
