<p><span class="font0">where the miners were at work. Some of theſe he perceived, which he cauſed to be opened, and the miners to be driven out by hand grenàdoes; others to be&nbsp;ſmothered, or burned, by ſetting fire to gunpowder.&nbsp;Yet did not this hinder two conſiderable ones to be&nbsp;ſprung, which did a vaſt deal of damage to the baſtion&nbsp;of England, by throwing down about fix fathoms of&nbsp;the wall, and filling up the ditch with its rubbiſh:&nbsp;whereupon the Turks immediately climbed up ſword in&nbsp;hand to the top of it, and planted ſeven of their ſtan-dards upon the parapet; but being ſtopped by a tra-verſe, the knights, recovering from their ſurpriſe, fell&nbsp;upon them with ſuch fury, that they were obliged to&nbsp;abandon it with great loſs. The grand-maſter, who&nbsp;was then at church, quickly came to the place with&nbsp;his ſhort pike in his hand, attended by his knights, encouraging all he met with, burghers, ſoldiers, and&nbsp;others, to fight bravely in defence of their religion&nbsp;and country, and arrived time enough to aſſiſt in the&nbsp;taking down their ſtandards, and driving down the&nbsp;enemy by the way they came up. In vain did the vi-zier Muſtapha endeavour to prevent their flight by killing ſome of the foremoſt with his ſword, and driving&nbsp;the reſt back; they were obliged to abandon the ba-ſtion, and, which was ſtill worſe, met with that death&nbsp;in their flight, which they had ſtrove to ſhun from&nbsp;the fire-arms which were diſcharged upon them from&nbsp;the ramparts. Three ſangiacs loſt their lives in this&nbsp;attack, beſides ſome thouſands of the Turks; the grand-maſter, on his ſide, loſt ſome of his braveſt knights,&nbsp;particularly his ſtandard-bearer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The attacks were almoſt daily renewed with the ſame ill ſucceſs and loſs of men, every general ſtriving. to ſig-nalize himſelf in the ſight of their emperor. At length&nbsp;the old general Peri, or Pyrrus, having haraſſed the&nbsp;troops which guarded the baſtion of Italy for ſeveral&nbsp;days ſucceſſively without intermiſſion, cauſed a ſtrong&nbsp;detachment, which he had kept concealed behind a cavalier, to mount the place by break of day, on the&nbsp;13th of September; where, finding them overcome with&nbsp;ſleep and fatigue, they cut the throats of the ſentinels,&nbsp;and, ſliding through the breach, were juſt going to&nbsp;fall upon them. The Italians, however, quickly recovered themſelves and their arms, and gave them an υb-ſtinate repulfe. The conteſt was fierce and bloody on&nbsp;both ſides; and the baſhaw, ſtill ſupplying his owe&nbsp;with new reinforcements, would hardly have failed of&nbsp;overpowering the other, had not the grand maſter,&nbsp;whom the alarm had quickly reached, timely intervened,&nbsp;and, by his preſence, as well as example, revived his&nbsp;Rhodians, and thrown a ſudden panic among the enemy.&nbsp;Pyrrus, deſirous to do ſomething to wipe off the diſ-grace of this repulſe, tried his fortune next on an adjoining work, lately railed by the grand-maſter Carettii:&nbsp;but here his ſoldiers met with a ſtill worſe treatment,&nbsp;being almoſt overwhelmed with the hand-grenadoes,&nbsp;melted pitch, and boiling oil, which came pouring upon them, whilſt the forces which were on the adjacent&nbsp;flanks made as great a ſlaughter of thoſe that fled; in-ſomuch that the janiſſaries began to reſume their old&nbsp;murmuring tone, and cry out that they were brought&nbsp;thither only to be ſlaughtered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The grand vizier Muſtapha, afraid leſt their complaints ſhould reach his matter, agreed at length, as the laſt reſort, to make a freſh attempt on the baſtion</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">of England, whilſt, to cauſe a diverſion, the baſhaw Ahmed ſprung ſome freſh mines at an oppoſite part of&nbsp;the city. This was accordingly executed on the 17th&nbsp;of September; when the former, at the head of five&nbsp;battalions, reſolutely mounted or rather crept up the&nbsp;breach, and, in ſpite of the fire of the Engliſh, advanced ſo far as to pitch ſome ſtandards on the top; when,&nbsp;on a ſudden, a crowd of Engliſh knights, commanded&nbsp;by one Bonk, or Burk, ſallied out of their entrenchments, and, aſſiſted by ſome other officers of diſtinc-tion, obliged them to retire, though in good order,&nbsp;Muſtapha, provoked at it, led them back, and killed&nbsp;ſeveral knights with his own hand; and had his men&nbsp;ſupported him as they ought, the place muſt have been yielded to him: but the fire which was made from the&nbsp;adjacent batteries and muſketry diſconcerted them to&nbsp;ſuch a degree, that neither threats nor entreaties could&nbsp;prevent their abandoning the enterpriſe, and dragging&nbsp;him away with them by main force. The Rhodians&nbsp;loſt in that action ſeveral brave knights, both Engliſh&nbsp;and German; and, in particular, John Burk, their valiant commander: but the Turks loſt above 3000 men,&nbsp;beſides many officers of diſtinction. Much the fame&nbsp;ill ſucceſs having attended Ahmed with his mines, one&nbsp;of which had been opened, and the other only bringing&nbsp;ſome fathoms of the wall down, he was alſo obliged to-retreat; his troops, though ſome of the very beſt, being forced to diſperſe themſelves, after having borne&nbsp;the fire and fury of the Spaniſh and Auvergnian knights&nbsp;as long as they were able.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By this time Solyman, aſhamed and exaſperated at his ill ſucceſs, called a general council; in which he&nbsp;made ſome ſtinging reflections On his vizier, for having&nbsp;repreſented the reduction of Rhodes as a very eaſy enterpriſe. To avoid the effects of the ſultan’s reſent-ment, the ſubtle Muſtapha declared, that hitherto they&nbsp;had fought the enemy as it were upon equal terms, as if they had been afraid of taking an ungenerous advantage of their ſuperiority, by which, ſaid he, we have&nbsp;given them an opportunity of oppoſing us with their&nbsp;united force wherever we attacked them. But let us&nbsp;now reſolve upon a general aſſault on ſeveral ſides of&nbsp;the town; and ſee what a poor defence their ſtrength,&nbsp;thus divided, will be able to make againſt our united&nbsp;force. The advice was immediately approved by all,&nbsp;and the time appointed for the execution of it was on the 24th of that month, and every thing was ordered&nbsp;to be got ready againſt that day. Accordingly the&nbsp;town was actually aſſaulted at four different parts, alter&nbsp;having ſuffered a continual fire for ſome time from their&nbsp;artillery in order to widen the breaches; by which the&nbsp;grand-maſter eaſily underſtood their delign, and that&nbsp;the baſtions of England and Spain, the poſt of Provence, and terrace of Italy, were pitched upon for the&nbsp;aſſault, and took his precautions accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The morning was no ſooner come, than each party mounted their reſpective breach with an undaunted bravery, the young lultan, to animate them the more, having ordered his throne to be reared on an eminence,&nbsp;whence he could ſee all that was done. The Rhodians,&nbsp;on the other hand, were no leſs diligent in repulling&nbsp;them with their cannon and other fire-arms, with their&nbsp;melted lead, boiling oil, ſtink-pots, and other uſual expedients. The one ſide aſcend the ſcaling ladders,&nbsp;ferleſs of all that oppoſed them; the other overturn</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
