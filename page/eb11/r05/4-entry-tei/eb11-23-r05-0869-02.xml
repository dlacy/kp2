                <p><label>RUSSIA</label>
                    <hi rend="italic">(Rossiya),</hi> the general name for the European and Asiatic
                    dominions of the “ Tsar of All the Russias.” Although the name is thus correctly
                    applied, both in English and Russian, to the whole area of the Russian empire,
                    its application is often limited, no less correctly, to European Russia, or even
                    to European Russia exclusive of Finland and Poland. The use of the name in its
                    most comprehensive sense dates only from the expansion of the empire in the 19th
                    century; to the historian who writes of the earlier growth of the empire, Russia
                    means, at most, Russia in Europe, or Muscovy, as it was usually called until the
                    18th century, from Moscow, its ancient capital. The origin of the term “ Russia
                    ” has been much disputed. It is certainly derived, through <hi rend="italic"
                        >Rossiya,</hi> from Slavonic <hi rend="italic">Rus</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ros</hi> (Byzantine *P£s or ’Póaot), a name first given to the
                    Scandinavians who founded a principality on the Dnieper in the 9th century; and
                    afterw’ards extended to the collection of Russian states of which this
                    principality formed the nucleus. The word <hi rend="italic">Rus,</hi> in former
                    times wrongly connected with the tribal name Rhoxolani, is more probably derived
                    from <hi rend="italic">Ruotsi^</hi> a Finnish name for the Swedes, which seems
                    to be a corruption of the Swedish <hi rend="italic">rothsmenn,</hi> “ rowers ”
                    or “ seafarers.”</p>

               <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">The Russian Empire</hi></p>
               <p>The Russian empire stretches over a vast territory in E. Europe and N. Asia,
                    with an area exceeding 8,660,000 sq. m., or one-sixth of the land surface of the
                    globe (one twenty-third of its whole superficies). It is, however, but thinly
                    peopled on the average, including only one-twelfth of the inhabitants of the
                    earth. It is almost entirely confined to the cold and temperate zones. In Novaya
                    Zemlya and the Taimyr peninsula, it projects within the Arctic Circle as far as
                    77° 6' and 77° 40' N. respectively; while its S. extremities reach 38° 50' in
                    Armenia, 35° on the Afghan frontier, and 42° 30' on the coasts of the Pacific.
                    To the W. it advances as far as 20° 40' E. in Lapland, 17° in Poland, and 29°
                    42' on the Black Sea; and its E. limit—East Cape on the Bering Strait—is in 191°
                    E.</p>
               <p>The White, Barents and Kara Seas of the Arctic bound it on the N., and the
                    northern Pacific—that is, the Seas of Bering, Okhotsk and Japan—bounds it on the
                    E. The Baltic, with the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland, limits it on the N.W.; and
                    two sinuous lines of land frontier separate it respectively from Sweden and
                    Norway on the N.W. and from Prussia, Austria and Rumania on the W. On the S. and
                    E. the frontier has changed frequently according to the expansion and
                    contraction of the empire under the pressure of political exigency and
                    expedience. The Black Sea is the principal demarcating feature on the S. of
                    European Russia. On the W. side of that sea the S. frontier touches the Danube
                    for some 120 m.; on the E. side of the same sea it zigzags from the Black Sea to
                    the Caspian, utilizing the river Aras (Araxes) for part of the distance. As the
                    Caspian is virtually a Russian sea, Persia may be said to form the next link in
                    the S. boundary of the Russian empire, followed by Afghanistan. On the Pamirs
                    Russia has since 1885 been conterminous with British India (Kashmir); but the
                    boundary then swings away N. round Chinese Turkestan and the N. side of
                    Mongolia, and, since 1904-5, it has skirted the N. of Manchuria, being separated
                    from it by the river Amur. As thus traced, the boundary in Central Asia includes
                    the two khanates of Bokhara and Khiva, which, though nominally protected states,
                    are to all intents and purposes integral parts of the Russian empire. But it
                    excludes Manchuria, with the Liao-tung peninsula and Port Arthur, upon which
                    Russia only placed her grasp in 1898-99, a grasp which she was compelled by
                    Japan to release after the war of 1904-5. The total length of the frontier line
                    of the Russian empire by land is 2800 m. in Europe, and nearly 10,000 m. in
                    Asia, and by sea over 11,000 m. in Europe and</p>
               <p>between 19,000 and 20,000 m. in Asia.</p>
               <p>Russia has no oceanic possessions; her islands are all appendages of the
                    mainland to which they belong. Such are Karlo, East Kvarken, the Aland
                    archipelago, Dago, and Osel or Oesel in the Baltic Sea; Novaya</p>
               <p>Zemlya, with Kolguyev and Vaigach, in the Barents Sea; the Solovetski Islands in
                    the White Sea; the New Siberian archipelago, Wrangel Land and Bear Islands, off
                    the Siberian coast; the Commander Islands off Kamchatka; the Shan tar Islands
                    and the N. of Sakhalin in the Sea of Okhotsk. The Aleutian archipelago was sold
                    to the United States in 1867, together with Alaska, and in 1875 the Kurile
                    Islands were ceded to Japan.</p>
               <p>If the border regions, that is, two narrow belts, on the N. and S., be left out
                    of account, a striking uniformity of physical feature prevails throughout the
                    whole vast extent of the Russian empire. High plateaus like that of Pamir (the “
                    Roof of the World ”) and Armenia, and lofty mountain chains like the snow-clad
                    Caucasus, the Alai, the Tian-shan, the Sayan Mountains, exist only on the out</p>
               <p>skirts of the empire.</p>
               <p>Viewed broadly, the Russian empire may be said to occupy the territories to the
                    N.W. of the great plateau formation of the old continent—the backbone of
                    Asia—which stretches with decreasing altitude and width from the high tableland
                    of Tibet and Pamir to the lower plateaus of Mongolia, and thence N.E. through
                    the Vitim</p>
               <p>region to the farthest extremity of Asia. Thus it consists of the immense plains
                    and flat lands which extend between the plateau formation and the Arctic Ocean,
                    including the series of parallel chains and hilly spurs which skirt the former
                    region on the N.W. And it is only to the E. of Lake Baikal that it climbs up on
                    to the plateau, from which it descends again before it reaches the Pacific.</p>
               <p>This plateau formation—the oldest geological continent of Asia— being unfit for
                    agriculture, and for the most part unsuited for permanent settlement, while its
                    oceanic slopes have from the dawn of history been occupied by a relatively dense
                    population, long prevented Slav colonization from reaching the.Pacific. The
                    Russians chanced to cross it in the 17th century at its narrowest and most N.
                    part, and thus struck the Pacific on the foggy and <hi rend="italic">froze
                        n</hi> shores of the Sea of Okhotsk; but two centuries elapsed ere, after
                    colonizing the depressions around Lake Baikal, they crossed over the plateau in
                    a more genial zone and descended to the Pacific by the Amur. After that they
                    spread rapidly S., up to the nearly uninhabited valley of the Usuri, to what is
                    now the Gulf of Peter the Great. In the S.W. higher portions of the plateau
                    formation the empire has only comparatively recently planted its foot on the
                    Pamir, and it was only a few years earlier that it established itself firmly on
                    the highlands of Armenia.</p>
               <p>A broad belt of hilly tracts—in every respect alpine in character, and
                    displaying the same variety of climate and organic life as alpine tracts usually
                    do—skirts the plateau formation throughout its entire length on the N. and N.W.,
                    forming an intermediate region between the plateau and the plains. .The
                    Caucasus, the Elburz, the Kopet-dagh and Paropamisus, the intricate and
                    imperfectly known network of mountains W. of the Pamir, the Tian-shan and the
                    Ala-tau mountain regions, and farther N.E. the Altai, the still unnamed complex
                    of the Minusinsk Mountains, the intricate mountain-chains of Sayan, with those
                    of the Olekma, Vitim and Aldan all arranged <hi rend="italic">en échelon—</hi>
                    the former from N.W. to S.E., and the others from S.W. to N.E.—all these belong
                    to the same alpine belt that borders the plateau from end to end of the series.</p>
               <p>The flat lands which extend from the base of the Alpine foothills to the shores
                    of the Arctic Ocean, assume the character either of dry deserts, as in the
                    Aral-Caspian depression, or of low tablelands, as in central Russia and E.
                    Siberia, of lacustrine regions in N.W. Russia and Finland, or of marshy prairies
                    in W. Siberia, and of <hi rend="italic">tundras</hi> in the far N. Throughout
                    the whole of this vast area, their monotonous surfaces are diversified by only a
                    few, and, for the most part, low, hilly tracts. Recently emerged, from the
                    Post-Pliocene sea., or freed from their mantle of ice, they persistently
                    maintain the self-same features over immense areas; and the few portions that
                    rise above the general elevation have more the character of broad and gentle
                    swellings than of mountain-chains. Of this class are the swampy plateaus of the
                    Kola peninsula, sloping gently S. to the lacustrine region of Finland and N.W..
                    Russia; the Valdai tablelands, where all the great rivers of Russia take their
                    rise ; the broad and gently sloping meridional belt of the Ural Mountains; and
                    lastly the Taimyr, Tunguzka and Verkhoyansk ranges in Siberia, which,
                    notwithstanding their sub-Arctic position, do not reach the snow-line. The
                    picturesque Bureya Mountains above the Amur, the forest-clad Sikhota-ahn on the
                    Pacific., and the volcanic chains of Kamchatka belong, however, to quite another
                    orographical construction, being the border-ridges of the terraces by which the
                    great plateau formation descends to the depths of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
               <p>It is.owing to these leading orographical features—divined by Carl Ritter, but
                    only recently ascertained and established as fact by geographical research—that
                    so many of the great rivers of the old continent are comprised within the limits
                    of the.Russian empire. Taking their rise on the plateau formation, or in its
                    outskirts, they flow first along lofty longitudinal valleys formerly filled with
                    great lakes, next they cleave their way through the rocky barriers, and finally
                    they enter the lowlands, where they become navigable, and, describing wide
                    curves to avoid here ana there the minor plateaus and hilly tracts, they bring
                    into water-communication with one another places thousands of miles apart. The
                    double river-systems of the Volga and Kama, the Ob and Irtysh, the Angara and
                    Yenisei,.the Lena and Vitim on the Arctic slope, and the Amur and Sungari on the
                    Pacific slope, are instances. These were the obvious channels of Russian
                    colonization.</p>
               <p>A broad depression—the Aral-Caspian desert—has arisen where the plateau
                    formation reaches its greatest altitude, and at the same time suddenly changes
                    its direction from N.W. to N.E. This desert is now filled to only, a small
                    extent by the salt waters of the Caspian, Aral and Balkash inland seas; but it
                    bears unmistakable traces of having been during Post-Pliocene times an immense
                    inland basin. There the Volga, the Ural, the Syr-darya and the Amu-dap'a
                    discharge their waters without reaching the ocean, but they bring life to the
                    rapidly desiccating Transcaspian steppes, and link together the most remote
                    parts of Russia.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The most striking feature in the geology of
                    Russia is its</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r05-0871" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0928.jp2"/>
               <p>remarkable freedom from disturbances, either in the form of moun-rain folding or
                    of igneous intrusions. Over the greater part of the</p>
               <p>country the strata are still nearly as flat as when they were first laid down,
                    and the deposits, even of the Cambrian period, are as soft as those of the
                    Mesozoic and Tertiary formations in England. Only in the Urals, the Caucasus,
                    the Timan Mountains, the region of the Donets coalfield, and the Kielce Hills is
                    there any sign of the great folding from which nearly the whole of the rest of
                    Europe has suffered at one time or another.</p>
               <p>In the early part of the Palaeozoic era only the gneissic region of Finland and
                    Olonets and probably the Archean mass of S. Russia remained constantly above the
                    sea; but there were several oscillations. Gradually, however, the sea retreated
                    from W. Russia and in the Upper Carboniferous and Permian periods it was
                    confined to the E.</p>
               <p>At the beginning of the Mesozoic era the whole country became land, bearing upon
                    its surface the salt lakes in which the Trias was laid down. During the Jurassic
                    period the sea again invaded the region, both from the N. and from the S., but
                    still the W. of Russia rose above the waves. In the Cretaceous period the waters
                    withdrew from the N.E., but in the S. they spread W., covering the whole of
                    Poland and finally uniting with the ocean in which the chalk of W. Europe was
                    deposited. The Tertiary era was marked by a gradual extension S. of the N.
                    land-mass. In the later stages arms of the sea were cut off and were converted
                    at,first into lagoons and then into brackish or fresh-water lakes which
                    continued to occupy much of S. Russia until the beginning of the Quaternary
                    period.</p>
               <p>During the first part of the Glacial period Russia seems to have been covered by
                    an immense ice-sheet, which extended also over central Germany, and of which the
                    E. limits cannot yet be determined.</p>
               <p>The Archean rocks have a broad extension in Finland, N. Russia, the Ural
                    Mountains, and <hi rend="sup">r</hi> the Caucasus., In S. Russia they form the
                    floor upon which lies a thin covering of Tertiary beefs, and they are exposed to
                    view in the valleys of the Dnieper and, the Bug. They consist for the most part
                    of red and grey gneisses and granufites, with subordinate layers of granite and
                    granitite. The Finland <hi rend="italic">rappa-kivi,</hi> the Serdobol gneiss,
                    and the Pargas and Rustíala marble (with the so-called <hi rend="italic">Eozoon
                        canadense)</hi> yield good building stone; while iron, copper and zinc-ore
                    are common in Finland and in the Urals. Rocks regarded as representing the
                    Huronian system appear also in Finland, in N.W. Russia, as a narrow strip on the
                    Urals, and in the Dnieper ridge. They consist of a series of unfossiliferous
                    crystalline slates.</p>
               <p>The Cambrian is represented by blue clays, ungulite sandstones and bituminous
                    slates in Esthonia and St Petersburg. The Ordovician and Silurian systems are
                    widely developed, and it is most probable that, with the exception of the
                    Archean continents of Finland and the S , the sea covered the whole of Russia.
                    Being concealed, however, by more recent deposits, the deposits appear on the
                    surface only in N.W. Russia (Esthonia, Livonia, St Petersburg and on the
                    Volkhov),‘where all the subdivisions of the system have been found; in the Timan
                    ridge; on the W. slope of the Urals; in the Pai-kho ridge; and in the islands of
                    tne Arctic Ocean. In Poland the rocks of these periods are met with in the
                    Kielce Mountains, and in Podolia in the deeper ravines.</p>
               <p>The Devonian dolomites, limestones and red sandstones cover immense tracts and
                    appear on the surface over a much wider area. From Esthonia these, rocks extend
                    N.E. to Lake Onega, and S.E. to Mogilev; they form ‘.the central plateau, as
                    also the slopes of the Urals and the Petchora region. In N.W. and middle Russia
                    they contain a special fauna, and it appears that the Lower Devonian series of,
                    W. Europe, represented in Poland and in the Urals, is missing in N.W. and
                    central Russia, where only the Middle and Upper Devonian divisions are found.</p>
               <p>Carboniferous deposits occur over nearly* the whole of E. Russia, their W.
                    boundary being a line drawn from Archangel to the upper Dnieper, thence to, the
                    upper Don, and S. to the mouth of the last-named river, with a long narrow gulf
                    extending W. to encircle the plateau of the Donets. They are visible, however,
                    only on the W. borders of this region, being covered towards the E. by thick
                    Permian and Triassic strata. Russia has three large coal-bearing regions—the,
                    Moscow basin, the Donets region and the Urals. In the Valdai plateau there are
                    only a few beds of mediocre coal. In the Moscow basin, which was a broad gulf of
                    the Carboniferous sea, coal appears as isolated inconstant seams amidst littoral
                    deposits, the formation of which was favoured by frequent minor subsidences, of
                    the seacoast. The coal is here confined to the lower, division of the system;
                    the Upper Carboniferous (corresponding with the English Coal-Measures) is
                    exclusively marine, consisting chiefly of <hi rend="italic">Fusulina</hi>
                    limestone. The Donets Coal-Measures, containing abundant remains of a rich
                    land-flora, cover nearly 16,000 sq. m., and comprise a valuable stock of
                    excellent anthracite and coal, together with iron-mines. In this basin, as in W.
                    Europe generally, the principal coal seams occur , in the Upper Carboniferous,
                    while the Lower Carboniferous is mainly composed of marine deposits, with,
                    however, the first bed of coal near its summit. Several smaller coalfields on
                    the slopes of the Urals and on the Timan ridge may be added to the above. The
                    Polish coalfields belong to another Carboniferous area of deposit, which
                    extended over Silesia.</p>
               <p>The Permian limestones and marls occupy a strip in E. Russia of much less extent
                    than that assigned to them by Murchison. The variegated marls of E. Russia, rich
                    in salt-springs,, but very poor in fossils, are now held by most Russian
                    geologists to be Triassic. The Permian deposits contain marine shells and also
                    remains of plants similar to those of England and Germany. But in the government
                    of Vologda, on the rivers Sukhona and N. Dvina, <hi rend="italic">Glossopteris,
                        Noeggerathiopsis</hi> and other ferns characteristic of the Indian Gondwana
                    beds have been found; and with these are numerous remains of reptiles similar to
                    those, which occur in the Indian deposits. In the Urals the marine facies is
                    more fully developed and the fauna shows affinities with that of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Pro-ductus</hi> limestone of the Central Asian mountain belt.</p>
               <p>During the Jurassic period the sea began again to invade Russia from S.E. and
                    N.W. The limits of the Russian Jurassic system may be represented by a line
                    drawn from the double valley of the Sukhona and Vytchegda to that of the upper
                    Volga, and thence toKieff, with a wide gulf penetrating towards the NAV. Within
                    this space three depressions, all, running SAV. to N.E., are filled up with
                    Upper Jurassic deposits. They are much denuded in the higher parts of this
                    region, and appear but as isolated islands in central Russia. In the S.E. all
                    the older subdivisions are represented, the deposits having the characters of a
                    deep-sea formation in the Aral-Caspian region and on the Caucasus.</p>
               <p>Cretaceous beds—sands, loose sandstones, marls and white chalk—occupy nearly the
                    whole of the region S. of a line drawn from the Niemcn to the upper Oka, and
                    Don, and thence N.E. to Simbirsk. Over a large part of this, area, however, they
                    are concealed by the later Tertiary, deposits, and they are absent over the
                    Dnieper and Don ridge in the Yaila Mountains and in the higher parts of the
                    Caucasus. They are rich in grinding stone, and in phosphatic deposits.</p>
               <p>The Tertiary formations occupy large areas in S. Russia. The Eocene covers wide
                    tracts from Lithuania to Tsaritsyn, and is represented in the Crimea and
                    Caucasus by thick deposits belonging to the same ocean which left its deposits
                    on the Alps and the Himalayas. Oligoccne, quite similar to that of N. Germany,
                    and containing brown coal and amber, has been met w*ith only in Poland, Courland
                    and Lithuania. The Miocene, (Sarmatian stage) occupies extensive tracts in S.
                    Russia, S. of a line drawn through Lublin to Ekaterinoslav and Saratov. Not only
                    the higher chains of Caucasus and Yaila, but also the Donets ridge, rose above
                    the</p>

               <p>level of the Miocene sea, which was very shallow to the N. of this last ridge,
                    while farther S. it was connected both with the Vienna basin and with the
                    Aral-Caspian. The Pliocene appears only in the coast region of the Black and
                    Azov Seas, but it is widely developed in the Aral-Caspian region, where,
                    however, the Ust-Urt and the Obshchiy Syrt rose above the sea.</p>
               <p>The thick Quaternary, or Post-Pliocene, deposits which cover nearly all Russia
                    were for a long time a puzzle to geologists. They consist of a boulder clay in
                    the N. and of loess in the S. The former presents an intimate mixture of
                    boulders brought from Finland and Olonets (with an addition of local boulders)
                    with small gravel, coarse sand and the finest glacial mud,—the whole bearing no
                    trace of ever having been washed up and sorted by water in motion, except in
                    subordinate layers of glacial sand and gravel; the size of the boulders
                    decreases on the whole from N. to S., and the boulder clay, especially in N. and
                    central Russia, often takes the shape of ridges parallel to the direction of the
                    motion of the boulders. Its S. limits, roughly corresponding with those
                    established by Murchison, but not yet settled in the S.E. and E., are, according
                    to M. Nikitin, the following:—from the S. frontier of Poland to Ovrutch, Uman,
                    Kremenchug, Poltava and Razdornaya (5O°[N. latitude), with a curve N. to Kozelsk
                    (?); thence due N. to Vetluga (¿8° N. latitude), E. to Glazova in Vyatka, and
                    from this place towards the N. and W. along the watershed of the Volga and
                    Pechora (?). S. of the 50th parallel appears the loess, with all its usual
                    characters (land fossils, want 01 stratification, &amp;c.), showing a
                    remarkable uniformity of composition over very large surfaces; it covers both
                    watersheds and valleys, but chiefly the former. Such being the characters of the
                    Quaternary deposits in Russia, the majority of Russian geologists now adopt the
                    opinion that Russia was covered, as far as the above limits, with an immense
                    ice-sheet which crept over central Russia and central Germany from Scandinavia
                    and N. Russia. Another ice covering was probably advancing at the same time from
                    the N.E., that is, from the N. of the Urals, but the question as to the
                    glaciation of the Urals still remains open. As to the loess, the usual view is
                    that it was a steppe-deposit due to the drifting of fine sand and dust during a
                    dry episode in the Pleistocene period.</p>
               <p>The deposits of the Post-Glacial period are represented throughout Russia,
                    Poland and Finland, as also throughout Siberia and Central Asia, by very thick
                    lacustrine deposits, which show that, after the melting of the ice-sheet, the
                    country was covered with immense lakes, connected by broad channels (the <hi
                        rend="italic">fjarden</hi> of the Swedes), which later on gave rise to the
                    actual, rivers. On the outskirts of the lacustrine region, traces of marine
                    deposits, not higher than 200 or perhaps even 150 ft. above present sea-level,
                    are found alike on the Arctic Sea. and on the Baltic and Black Sea coasts. A
                    deep gulf of the Arctic Sea advanced up the valley of the Dvina; and the
                    Caspian, connected by the Manych with the Black Sea, and by the Uzboy valley
                    with Lake Aral, penetrated N. up the Volga valley, as far as its Samara bend.
                    Unmistakable traces show that, while during the Glacial period Russia had an
                    arctic flora and fauna, the climate of the Lacustrine period was more genial
                    than it is now, and a dense human population at that time peopled the shores of
                    the numberless lakes..</p>
               <p>The Lacustrine period has not yet reached its close in Russia. Finland and the
                    N.W. hilly plateaus are still in the same geological phase, and.are dotted with
                    numberless lakes and ponds, while the rivers continue to dig out their yet
                    undetermined channels. But the. great lakes which covered, tne country during
                    the Lacustrine period have disappeared, leaving behind them immense marshes like
                    those of the rripet and in the N.E. The disappearance of what still remains of
                    them is accelerated not only by the general decrease of. moisture, but also
                    perhaps by the gradual upheaval of N. Russia, which is going on from Esthonia
                    and Finland to the Kola peninsula and Novaya Zemlya, at an average rate of about
                    two feet per century. This upheaval—the consequences of which have been felt
                    even within the historic period, by the drainage of the formerly impracticable
                    marshes of Novgorod and at the head of the Gulf of Finland—together with tne
                    destruction of forests (which must be considered, however, as a quite
                    subordinate cause), contributes towards a decrease of precipitation over Russia
                    and towards increased shallowness of her rivers. At the same time, as the
                    gradients, are gradually increasing on account of the upheaval of the continent,
                    the rivers dig their channels deeper and deeper.. Consequently central and
                    especially S. Russia .witness the. formation of numerous, miniature canons, or
                        <hi rend="italic">ovraghi</hi> (deep ravines), the summits of which rapidly
                    advance and ramify in the loose surface deposits. As for the S. steppes, their
                    desiccation, the consequence of the above causes, is in rapid progress. <note

               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Population.</hi> —The population of the empire, which was
                    estimated at 74,000,000 in 1859, was found to be over 129,200,000 at the census
                    of 1897, taken over all the empire except Finland. In 1904 it was estimated to
                    be 143,000,000, and in 1906, according to a detailed estimate of the Central
                    Statistical Committee, it was 149,299,300. Thus from i860 to 1897 the population
                    increased 74!%, and from 1897 to 1904 26-3, an average annual increase of about
                    35% as compared with an average annual increase of 2j% during the period
                    1860-97. The increase took place chiefly in the large cities, in Siberia,
                    Poland, Lithuania, S. Russia and Caucasia. The official divisions of the empire

                    the greatest increase, having taken place in the E. Polish and in the Lithuanian
                    provinces, along the SAV. border, in the prairie belt beside the Black Sea, and
                    in Orenburg. N. Caucasia and S.W. Siberia likewise show a considerable increase.
                    The census of 1897 revealed in several provinces a remarkably low proportion of
                    men to women. This was owing to the fact that large numbers of the men engaged
                    in agricultural pursuits during the summer temporarily move every year into the
                    large industrial centres for the winter. Consequently there were only 87*4 and
                    89*8 women to every 100 men in the governments of St Petersburg and Taurida
                    respectively, but as many as 133*8 in Yaroslavl, 119 in Tver and 117 in
                    Kostroma. The average number of women to every 100 men in the Russian
                    governments proper was 1.02-9; <hi rend="sup">in</hi> Poland, 98-6; in Finland,
                    102-2; in Caucasia, 88-9; in Siberia, 93-7; and in Turkestan and Transcaspia,
                    83-0.</p>

               <p>The effects of emigration and immigration cannot be estimated with accuracy,
                    because only those who cross the frontier with passports are taken account of.
                    The statistics of these show that there was during the thirty-two years,
                    1856-88, an excess of emigration over immigration of 1,146,052 in the case of
                    Russians, and a surplus of immigration of 2,304,717 foreigners. On the other
                    hand, in the six years, 1892-97, the excess of Russian emigration over
                    immigration was 207,353, as compared with an excess of foreign immigration over
                    emigration of only 136,740.. During the years 1900-4 inclusive the total
                    emigrants from Russia numbered 2,358,539, of whom 1,144,246 were Russians; while
                    the immigrants numbered 2,333,053, of whom 1,432,057 were foreigners. It is also
                    known that the number of Russian immigrants into the United States in 1891-1902
                    was 742,869, as compared with 313,469 in 1873-90, or a grand total since 1873 of
                    1,056,338. By far the greater part of these were</p>
               <p>Jews. The emigration to Siberia varies much from year to year, It was 26,129 in
                    1888, and 60,000 in 1898. During the two following years it amounted to an
                    average of over 160,000, but in the years 1901-3 to an average of 84,638 per
                    annum. Altogether some 800,000 peasants are estimated to have settled in Siberia
                    during the period 1886-96, but during the years 1893-1905 no less than four
                    millions in all. There is also some emigration from central Russia to the S.
                    Urals, as well as to some of the steppe governments.</p>
               <p>Within the empire a very great diversity of nationalities is comprised, due to
                    the amalgamation or absorption by the Slav race of a variety of Ural-Altaic
                    stocks, of Turko-Tatars, Turko-Mongols and various Caucasian races. In some
                    cases their ethnical relations have not yet been completely determined.
                    According to the results obtained by the census committee of 1897, working on a
                    linguistic basis, the distribution of races was as given in the table opposite :

                    but in the years 1857-60 less than 10% was urban. In Russia proper less than 2%

               <p>There were in European Russia and Poland only twelve cities with more than
                    100,000 inhabitants in 1884; in 1900 there were sixteen, namely, St Petersburg,
                    Moscow, Warsaw, Odessa, Lodz, Riga, Kiev, Kharkov, Vilna, Saratov, Kazan,
                    Ekaterinoslav, Rostov-on-the Don, Astrakhan, Tula and Kishinev. In other parts
                    of the empire there were four cities each having over 100,000 inhabitants in
                    that year, namely, Baku, Tiflis, Tashkent and Helsingfors. While only three of
                    these are in middle Russia (Moscow, Tula and Kazan), eight are in S. Russia.
                    There are thirty-four cities in European Russia and Poland, and forty in the
                    entire empire, with from 50,000 to 100,000 inhabitants each. The rural
                    population live for the most part in villages, not as a rule scattered about the
                    country. In the inclement regions of the N. and in the N. parts of the forest
                    zone the villages are very small. They are larger, but still small, in White
                    Russia, Lithuania and the region of the lakes; but in the steppe governments
                    they are very appreciably bigger, some of the Cossack <hi rend="italic"
                        >stanitsas</hi> or settlements exceeding 20,000, and many of them numbering
                    more than 10,000 inhabitants each. The houses are generally built of wood and
                    wear a poverty-stricken aspect. Owing to the great risks from fire the villages
                    usually cover a large area of ground, and the houses are scattered and
                    straggling. The mortality in most towns is so great that during the last ten
                    years of the 19th century, in a very great number of cities, the deaths exceeded
                    the births by 1 to 4 in the thousand. (P. A. K.; J. T. Be.)</p>

                    illustrates the difficulty of defining in a single formula the system,

                    established in the Russian empire since October 1905. Before this date the
                    fundamental laws of Russia described the power of the emperor as “ autocratic
                    and unlimited.” The imperial style is still “Emperor and Autocrat of AU the
                    Russias ”; but in the fundamental laws as remodelled between the imperial

                    jealously preserved, the word “ unlimited ” vanished. Not that the régime in
                    Russia had become in any true sense constitutionaI, far less parliamentary; but
                    the “ unlimited autocracy ” had given place to a “ self-limited autocracy,”
                    whether permanently so limited, or only at the discretion of the autocrat,
                    remaining a subject of heated controversy between conflicting parties in the
                    state. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="3"> M. Stolypin

                        electoral law without the consent of the legislature, on the ground that
                        what the autocrat had granted the autocrat could take away. The members of
                        the Opposition, on the other hand, quoting Art. 84 of the fundamental, laws
                        (“The. empire is governed on the immutable basis of laws issued according to

                    and by preference to the male heir; the emperor and his consort must belong to
                    the Eastern Orthodox Church; the emperor can wear no crown that entails
                    residence abroad. By the manifesto of the 17/3oth of October 1905 the emperor
                    voluntarily limited his legislative power by decreeing that no measure was to
                    become law without the consent of the Imperial Duma, a freely elected national
                    assembly. By the law of the 20th of February 1906 the Council of the Empire was
                    associated with the Duma as a legislative Upper House; and from this time the
                    legislative power has been exercised normally by the emperor only in concert

               </p>
               <p>In the college itself the voting—secret and by ballot throughout—is by majority;
                    and since this majority consists, under the actual system, of very conservative
                    elements (the landottaiers and urban delegates having jths of the votes), the
                    progressive elements—however much they might preponderate in the country—would
                    have no chance of representation at all save for the curious provision that one
                    member at least in each government must be chosen from each of the five classes
                    represented in the college. For example, were there no reactionary peasant among
                    the delegates, a reactionary majority might be forced to return a Social
                    Democrat to the Duma. As it is, though a fixed <hi rend="italic">minimum of</hi>
                    peasant delegates <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be returned, they by no means
                    probably represent the opinion of the peasantry. That in the Duma any Radical
                    elements survive at all is mainly due to the peculiar franchise enjoyed by the
                    seven largest towns—St Petersburg, Moscow, Kiev, Odessa, Riga and the Polish
                    cities of Warsaw and Lodz. These elect their delegates to the Duma direct, and
                    though their votes are divided into two <hi rend="italic">curias</hi> (on the
                    basis of taxable property) in such a'way as to give the advantage to wealth,
                    each returning the same number of delegates, the democratic colleges can at
                    least return members of their own complexion. <note anchored="true"

                        type="authorial" n="17"> Strictly speaking, the title is inapplicable, there
                        being no collective official name for the two chambers. The word parliament
                        may, however, be used as a convenient term, failing a better. </note> thus
                    constituted is strictly limited. It shares with the emperor the legislative
                    power, including the discussion and sanctioning of the budget. But, so far as
                    the parliament is concerned, this power is subject to numerous and important
                    exceptions. All measures, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> dealing with the
                    organization of the army .and navy are outside its competence; these are no
                    longer called <hi rend="sup">a</hi> laws ” but “ ordinary administrative rules.”
                    Moreover, the procedure of the Houses practically places the control of
                    legislation in the hands of ministers. Any member may bring in a <hi rend="sup"
                        >a</hi> project of law,” but it has to be submitted to the minister of the
                    department concerned, who is allowed a month to consider it, and himself
                    prepares the final draft laid on the table of the House. Amendments, however,
                    may be and have been carried against the government. Ministers are responsible,
                    moreover, not to parliament but to the emperor. They may be interpellated, but
                    only on the legality, not the policy, of their acts. In the words of M.
                    Stolypin, there is no intention of converting the ministerial bench into a
                    prisoners' dock. If by a two-thirds majority the action of a minister be
                    arraigned, the president of the Imperial Council lays the case before the
                    emperor, who decides. The powers of the parliament over the budget are even more
                    limited, though not altogether illusory. No legislation by means of the budget
                    is allowed, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> no alteration may be made in credits
                    necessary for carrying out a law. This deprives parliament of control over the
                    administrative departments, all the ministries being • thus “ armour-plated ”—to
                    use the cant phrase current in Russia—except that of ways and communications
                    (railways). The sum of 700,000,000 roubles per annum is thus excepted from the
                    control of the chambers. Other exceptions are the “ Institutions of the Empress
                    Marie,” which absorb, <hi rend="italic">inter alia,</hi> the duties on
                    playing-cards and the taxes on places of public entertainment; the imperial
                    civil list, so far as this does not exceed the sum fixed in 1906 (16,359,595
                    roubles!); the expenses of the two imperial chanceries, 10,000,000 roubles per
                    annum, which constitute in effect a secret service fund. Altogether, half the
                    annual expenditure of the country is outside the control of parliament. Nor is
                    this all. If the budget be not sanctioned by the emperor, that of the previous
                    year remains in force, and the government has power, <hi rend="italic">motu
                        proprio,to</hi> impose the extra taxes necessary to carry out new laws. In
                    certain circumstances, too, the emperor reserves the right to raise fresh loans.</p>
               <p>Further, the emperor has the power to issue ordinances having the force of law,
                        <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> under extraordinary circumstances when the Duma
                    is not sitting. These ordinances must, however, be of a temporary nature, must
                    not infringe the fundamental laws or statutes passed by the two chambers, or
                    change the electoral system, and must be laid upon the table of the Duma at the
                    first opportunity. Since, however, the emperor has the-power of proroguing or
                    dissolving the Duma as often as he pleases, it is clear that these temporary
                    ordinances might in effect be made permanent. Finally, the emperor has the right
                    to proclaim anywhere and at any time a state of siege. In this way the
                    fundamental laws were suspended not only in Poland but in St Petersburg and
                    other parts of the empire during the greater part of the four years succeeding
                    the grant of the constitution.</p>
               <p>It should be noted, none the less, that the third Duma succeeded in establishing
                    its position, and that in view of its useful activities even the extreme Right
                    came to realize that there could be no return to the old undisguised absolutist
                    régime (see <hi rend="italic">History,</hi> below, <hi rend="italic">ad
                        fin.)..</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the law of the 18th of October (November 1) 1905, to assist the emperor in
                    the supreme administration a Council of Ministers <hi rend="italic">(Sovyet
                        Ministrw)</hi> created, under a minister president, the first appearance of
                    a prime minister in Russia. This council consists of all the ministers and of
                    the heads of the principal administrations. The ministries are as follows: (1)
                    of the Imperial Court, to which the administration of the apanages, the chapter
                    of the imperial orders, the imperial palaces and theatres, and the Academy of
                    Fine Arts are subordinated; (2) Foreign Affairs; (3) War and Marine; (4)
                    Finance; (5) Commerce and Industry (created in 1905); (6) Interior (including
                    police, health, censorship and press, posts and telegraphs, foreign religions,
                    statistics); (7) Agriculture; (8) Ways and Communications; (9) Justice; (10)
                    Public Instruction. Dependent on the Council of Ministers are two other
                    councils: the Holy Synod and the Senate.</p>
               <p>The Holy Synod (established in 1721) is the supreme organ of government of the
                    Orthodox Church in Russia. It is presided over by a lay procurator, representing
                    the emperor, and consists, for the rest, of the three metropolitans of Moscow,
                    St Petersburg and Kiev, the archbishop of Georgia, and a number of bishops
                    sitting in rotation.</p>
               <p>The Senate <hi rend="italic">(Pravitelstvuyushchî Sénat, i.e.</hi> directing or
                    governing senate), originally established by Peter the Great, consists of
                    members nominated by the emperor. Its functions, which are exceedingly various,
                    are carried out by the different departments into which it is divided. It is the
                    supreme court of cassation (see <hi rend="italic">Judicial System,</hi> below);
                    an audit office, a high court of justice for all political offences; one of its
                    departments fulfils the functions of a heralds' college. It also has supreme
                    jurisdiction in all disputes arising out of the administration of the empire,
                    notably differences between the representatives oflhe central power and the
                    elected organs of local self-government. Lastly, it examines into registers and
                    promulgates new laws, a function which, in theory, gives it a power, akin to
                    that of the Supreme Court of the United States, of rejecting measures not in
                    accordance with the fundamental laws.</p>
               <p>For purposes of provincial administration Russia is divided into 78 governments
                        <hi rend="italic">(guberniya),</hi> 18 provinces <hi rend="italic"
                        >(oblast)</hi> and 1 district <hi rend="italic">(okrug).</hi> Of these 11
                    governments, 17 provinces and 1 district (Sakhalin) belong to Asiatic Russia. Of
                    the rest 8 governments are in Finland,</p>
               <p>10 in Poland. European Russia thus embraces 59 governments and 1 province (that
                    of the Don). The Don province is under the direct jurisdiction of the ministry
                    of war; the rest have each a governor and deputy-governor, the latter presiding
                    over the administrative council^ In addition there are governors-general,
                    generally placed over several governments and armed with more extensive powers,</p>

               <p>usually including the command of the troops within the limits of their
                    jurisdiction. In 1906 there were governors-general in Finland, Warsaw, Vilna,
                    Kiev, Moscow and Riga. The larger cities (St Petersburg, Moscow, Odessa,
                    Sevastopol, Kcrtch-Yenikala, Nikolayev, Rostov) have an administrative system of
                    their own, independent of the governments; in these the chief of police acts as
                    governor. As organs of the central government there are further, the <hi

                    the governments are divided. These are nominated by the governors, <note

                    they are for the most part illiterate and wholly ignorant of the law, they have
                    proved exasperating engines of oppression. Towards the end of the reign of
                    Alexander II., the government, in order to preserve order in the country
                    districts, also created a special class of mounted rural policemen <hi

                    who, armed with power to arrest all suspects on the spot, rapidly became the

                    is the discovery, prevention and extirpation of political sedition. A secret
                    police, armed with inquisitorial and arbitrary powers, has always existed in
                    autocratic Russia. Its most famous development was the so-called “ Third Section
                    ” (of the imperial chancery) instituted by the emperor Nicholas I. in 1826. This
                    was entirely independent of the ordinary police, but was associated with the
                    previously existing corps of gendarmes <hi rend="italic">(Korpus
                        Zhandarmov),</hi> whose chief was placed at its head. Its object had
                    originally been to keep the emperor in close touch with all the branches of the
                    administration and to bring to his notice any abuses and irregularities (see
                    Nicholas I.), and for this purpose its chief was in constant personal
                    intercourse with the sovereign. Actually, however, its activity, directed mainly
                    to the discovery of political offences, degenerated into a hideous reign of
                    terror. Its organization was spread all over Russia; its procedure was secret
                    and summary (transportation by administrative order); and, its instruments being
                    for the most part ignorant and</p>
               <p>largely corrupt, its victims were counted by thousands.</p>
               <p>The “ Third Section ” was suppressed by Alexander II. in 1880, but only in name.
                    In fact it was transformed into a separate department of the ministry of the
                    interior, and, provided with an enormous secret service fund, soon dominated the
                    whole ministry. The corps of gendarmes was also incorporated in this department,
                    the under-secretary of the interior being placed at its head and at that of the
                    police generally, with practically unlimited jurisdiction in all cases which, in
                    the judgment of the minister of the interior, required to be dealt with by
                    processes outside the ordinary law. In 1896 the powers of the minister were
                    extended at the expense of those of the under-secretary, who remained only at
                    the head of the corps of gendarmes; but by a law of the 24th of September 1904
                    this was again reversed, and the under-secretary was again placed at the head of
                    all the police with the title of undersecretary for the administration of the
                    police.</p>

                    being absolutely subordinated to the governors, whose consent was necessary to
                    the validity of all their decisions, and who received drastic powers of

                        with a more liberal spirit. Many <hi rend="italic">zemstvos</hi> also made

               <p>Since 1870 the municipalities in European Russia have had institutions like

                    tax-paying merchants, artisans and workmen are enrolled on lists in a descending

                    into three equal parts, representing three groups of electors very unequal in
                    number, each of which elects an equal number of delegates to the municipal <hi

                    powers, were granted to several towns</p>
               <p>in Siberia, and in 1895 to some in Caucasia.</p>
               <p>In the Baltic provinces (Courland, Livonia and Esthonia) the landowning classes
                    formerly enjoyed considerable powers of self-government and numerous privileges
                    in matters affecting education, police and the administration of local justice.
                    But by laws promulgated in 1888 and</p>
               <p>1889 the rights of police and manorial justice were transferred from the
                    landlords to officials of the central government. Since about the same time a
                    process of rigorous Russification has been carried through in the same
                    provinces, in all departments of administration, in the higher schools and in
                    the university of Dorpat, the name of which was altered to Yuriev. In 1893
                    district committees for the management of the peasants’ affairs, similar to
                    those in the purely Russian governments, were introduced into this part of the
                    empire.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Judicial System.—</hi> Not the least valuable of the gifts of
                    the “ tsar emancipator,” Alexander II., to Russia was the judicial system
                    established by the statute <hi rend="italic">(Sudebni Ustav)</hi> of the 20th of
                    November 1864. The system which this superseded was not indigenous to Russia,
                    but had been set up by Peter the Great, who had taken as his model the
                    inquisitorial »procedure at that time in vogue on the continent of western
                    Europe. Both civil and criminal procedure were secret. All the proceedings were
                    conducted in writing, and the judges were not confronted with either the parties
                    or the witnesses until they emerged to deliver judgment. This secrecy, combined
                    with the fact that the judges were very ill paid, led to universal bribery and
                    corruption. To check this courts were multiplied (there were five, six or more
                    instances), which only multiplied the evil. Documents accumulated from court to
                    court, till none but the clerks who had written them could tell their gist;
                    costs were piled up; and all this, combined with the confusion caused by the
                    chaotic mass of imperial ukazes, ordinances and ancient laws—often inconsistent
                    or flatly contradictory—made the administration of justice, if possible, more
                    dilatory and capricious than in the old, unreformed English court of chancery.
                    Above all, there was no dividing line between the judiciary and the
                    administrative functions. The judges were not so by profession; they were merely
                    members of the official class <hi rend="italic">(chinovniks),</hi> the
                    prejudices and vices of which</p>
               <p>they shared.</p>
               <p>Of this system—except so far as the confusion of the laws is concerned—the
                    reform of 1864 made a clean sweep. The new system established—based partly on
                    English, partly on French models—was built up on certain broad principles: the
                    separation of the judicial and administrative functions, the independence of the
                    judges and courts, the publicity of trials and oral procedure, the equality of
                    all classes before the law. Moreover, a democratic element was introduced by the
                    adoption of the jury system and—so far as one order of tribunal was
                    concerned—the election of judges. The establishment of a judicial system on
                    these principles constituted, as M. Leroy-Beaulieu justly observes, a
                    fundamental change in the conception of the Russian state, which, by placing the
                    administration of justice outside the sphere of the executive power, ceased to
                    be a despotism. This fact made the new system especially obnoxious to the
                    bureaucracy, and during the latter years of Alexander II. and the reign of</p>
               <p>Alexander III. there was a piecemeal taking back of what had been given. It was
                    reserved for the third Duma, after the revolution, to begin the reversal of this
                    process. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="26"> An <hi
                            rend="italic">ukazoi</hi> 1879 gave the governors the right to report
                        secretly on the qualifications of candidates for the office of justice of
                        the peace. In 1869 Alexander III. abolished the election of justices of the
                        peace, except in certain large towns and some outlying parts of the empire,
                        and greatly restricted the right of trial by jury. The confusion of the
                        judicial and administrative functions was introduced. again by the
                        appointment of officials as judges. In 1909 the thira Duma restored the
                        election of justices of the peace. </note>
               </p>
               <p>The system established by the law of 1864 is remarkable in that it set up two
                    wholly separate orders of tribunals, each having their own courts of appeal and
                    coming in contact only in the senate, as the supreme court of cassation. The
                    first of these, based on the English model, are the courts of the elected
                    justices of the peace, with jurisdiction over petty causes, whether civil or
                    criminal; the second, based on the French model, are the ordinary tribunals of
                    nominated judges, sitting with or without a jury to hear important cases.</p>

               <p>Two important classes in Russia stood more or less outside the competence of the

                    retain a jurisdiction over the clergy which they have lost elsewhere in Europe;
                    anti in them the old secret written procedure survives. Their interest for the

               <p>mainly in the fact that marriage and divorce fall within their competence; and
                    their reform has been postponed IargeIy because the wealthy and corrupt society
                    of the Russian capital preferred a system which makes divorce easily purchasable
                    and avoids at the same time the scandal of publicity. The case of the peasants
                    is more interesting, and deserves a somewhat more detailed notice.</p>
               <p>The peasants, as already stated, form a class apart, untouched by the influence
                    of Western civilization, the principles of which they are quite incapable of
                    understanding or appreciating. This fact was recognized by the legislators of
                    1864, and beneath the statutory tribunals created in that year the special
                    courts of the peasants were suffered to survive. These were indeed but a few
                    years older. Up to 1861, the date of the emancipation, the peasant serfs had
                    been under the patrimonial jurisdiction of their lords. The edict of
                    emancipation abolished this jurisdiction, and set up instead in each <hi
                        rend="italic">volost</hi> a court particular to the peasants <hi
                        rend="italic">(volostnye sud),</hi> of which the judges and jury, themselves
                    peasants, were elected by the assembly of the <hi rend="italic">volost
                        (volostnye skhod)</hi> each year. In these courts the ordinary written law
                    had little to say; the décimons of the <hi rend="italic">volost</hi> courts were
                    based on the local customary law, which alone the peasants, and the peasants
                    alone, understand. The justice administered in them was patriarchal and rough,
                    but not ineffective. All civil cases involving less than 100 roubles value were
                    within their competence, and more important cases by consent of the parties.
                    They acted also as police courts in the case of petty thefts, breaches of the
                    peace and the like. They were also charged with the maintenance of order in the
                        <hi rend="italic">mir</hi> and the family, punishing infractions of the
                    religious law, husbands who beat their wives, and parents who ill-treated their
                    children. The penalty of flogging, preferred by the peasants to fine or
                    imprisonment, was not unknown. The judges were, of course, wholly illiterate,
                    and this tended to throw the ultimate power into the hands of the clerk <hi

                    classes—these were the distinctive features of the educational policy of the
                    last twenty years of the 19th century.</p>
               <p>It was only towards its close that a change took place in the attitude of the
                    government towards technical education, and a few high and middle technical
                    schools were opened. It was only then, too, that a reform was started in
                    secondary education, with the object of revising the so-called “ classical ”
                    system favoured in the lyceums since the ’seventies, the complete failure of
                    which has been demonstrated after nearly thirty years of experiment. Apart from
                    the schools under the ministry of war (Cossack <hi rend="italic">Voiskos</hi>
                    and schools at the barracks), the great bulk of the primary schools are either
                    under the ministry of public instruction or of the Holy Synod. Those under the
                    latter body are of recent growth, the policy of the last twenty years of the
                    19th century having been to hand over the budget allowances for primary
                    instruction to the Holy Synod, which opened parish schools under the local
                    priests. The schools under the Synod are themselves divided into two categories:
                    parish schools and reading schools of an inferior grade. No teaching
                    certificate, is required by the teachers in either class of school, the
                    permission of the bishop (like the French <hi rend="italic">lettre
                        d'obédience</hi> of 1849) being sufficient. The consequence is, that the
                    village priests, being too much occupied with their parochial duties, cannot
                    give more than casual or perfunctory attention to the schools, and the numerous
                    pupils either exist on paper only, or are handed over to half-educated cantors,
                    deacons or hired teachers. One good feature of the Russian primary school
                    system, however, is that in many villages there are school gardens or fields; in
                    nearly 1000 schools, bee-keeping, and in 300 silkworm culture is taught; .while
                    in some 900 schools the children receive instruction in various trades; and in
                    300 schools in <hi rend="italic">slojd</hi> (a system of manual training
                    originated in Finland). Girls are taught handwork in many schools. Nearly 50 %
                    of the teachers are women. The total expenditure on primary schools in 1900 was
                    £5,300,000 (about the average in recent years), of which 20% was supplied by the
                    state, 23% .by the <hi rend="italic">zemstvos,</hi> 35}% by the village
                    communities and the municipalities and n}% by private persons. The middle
                    schools are maintained by. the state, which contributes 25% of the expenditure
                    of the classical and technical schools, by the fees of .the. pupils (30%), and
                    by donations from the <hi rend="italic">zemstvos</hi> and municipalities. The
                    total grants from the state exchequer for education of all grades in all parts
                    of the empire amounted in 1906 to £8,107,000. The progress of primary education
                    is illustrated by the fact that, while in i88=&gt; there was one school for
                    every 2665 inhabitants and one pupil for every 48 inhabitants, in 1898 . the
                    figures were 1643 and 31 inhabitants respectively. According to the census of
                    1897 the number of illiterates varied from 89-2 to 44-9% oî the population in
                    the rural districts, and from 63*6 to 37*2 % in the urban.</p>
               <p>For higher education there were in 1904 only 9 universities (Yuriev or Dorpat,
                    Kazan, Kharkov, Kiev, Moscow, Odessa, St Petersburg, Warsaw and Tomsk), with
                    19,400 students, 6 medical academies,, (one for women), 6 theological academies,
                    6 military academies, 5 philological institutes, 3 Eastern languages institutes,
                    3 law schools, 4 veterinary, institutes, 4 agricultural colleges, 2 mining
                    institutes, 4 engineering institutes, 2 universities for women (930 students, at
                    St Petersburg), 3 technical pedagogic schools, io technical institutes, i
                    forestry and i topographical school. There has, however, been much activity
                    since 1905 in the establishment of new educational institutions, notably
                    technical and commercial schools, which are placed under the new minister of
                    commerce and industry. Finland has a university of its own at Helsingfors.</p>
               <p>The standard of teaching in the universities is on the whole very high, and may
                    be compared to that of the German universities. The students are hard working,
                    and generally very intelligent. Mostly sons of poor parents, they live in
                    extreme poverty, supporting themselves chiefly by translating and by tutorial
                    work.</p>
               <p>The state of secondary education still leaves much to be desired. The steady
                    tendency of Russian society towards increasing the number of secondary schools,
                    where instruction would be based on the study of the natural sciences, is
                    checked by the government in favour of the classical gymnasiums. <note

                    conservatism and change, the suspicious temper of the autocracy being revealed,
                    during the years of unstable equilibrium, by the alternate concession and

                    sciences, have been opened in the chief cities under the name of “ pedagogical
                    courses.” At St Petersburg a women's medical academy, the examinations of which
                    were even more searching than those of the ordinary academy (especially as
                    regards diseases of women and children), was opened, but after about one hundred
                    women had received the degree of M.D. it was suppressed by government. In
                    several university towns there are free teaching establishments for women,
                    supported by subscription, with programmes and examinations equal to those of
                    the universities.</p>
               <p>The natural sciences are much cultivated in Russia. Besides the Academy of
                    Science, the Moscow Society of Naturalists, the Mineralogical Society, the
                    Geographical Society, with its Caucasian and Siberian branches, the
                    archaeological societies and the scientific societies of the Baltic provinces,
                    all of which are of old and recognized standing, there have lately sprung up a
                    series of new societies in connexion with each university, and their serials are
                    yearly growing in importance, as, too, are those of the Moscow Society of
                    Friends of Natural Science, the Chemico-Physical Society, and various medical,
                    educational and other associations. The work achieved by Russian savants,
                    especially in biology, physiology and chemistry, and in the sciences
                    descriptive.of the vast territory of Russia, is well known to Europe.</p>
               <p>The ordinary revenue of the empire is in excess of the ordinary expenditure,
                    but.the extraordinary expenditure not only swallows up this surplus, but
                    necessitates the raising, of fresh loans every year. On the other hand, there is
                    a good deal to show for this extraordinary expenditure. A considerable number of
                    new railways, including the Siberian, have been built with money obtained from
                    that source. But since 1894 all extraordinary items of expenditure, with the
                    exception of those for the construction of new lines of railway, have been
                    defrayed out of. ordinary, revenue. The only sources of extraordinary revenue
                    still remaining under that head are the money derived from loans and the
                    perpetual deposits in the Imperial Bank. The ordinary revenue,- obtained
                    principally from the sale of spirits (28%), which is a state monopoly, from
                    state railways (23 j%) and customs (10j%), steadily rose from a total of
                    £132,750,000 in 1895 to a total of £214,360,000 in 1905. Other noteworthy
                    sources of revenue are trade licences, direct taxes on lands and forests, stamp
                    duties, posts and telegraphs, indirect taxes on tobacco, sugar and other
                    commodities, the crown forests, and land redemption payable annually by the
                    peasants since 1861. At the same time the total ordinary expenditure has
                    increased at a similarly steady rate, namely, from £119,391,000 in 1895 to
                    £202,544,000 in 1905. In 1904, 8ii%of the extraordinary expenditure, namely,
                    £71,550,000, was incurred in consequence of the war with Japan, and to this must
                    be added in 1906 a further expenditure of £42,085,000. The total national debt
                    of Russia nearly trebled between 1852 (£57,038,600) and 1862 (£145,500,000), and
                    again between 1872 (£242,277,000) and 1892 (£526,109,000) it more than doubled,
                    while by 1906 it amounted altogether to £812,040,000. Of the</p>
               <p>total, 77% stands at 4% and 17 at less than 4%.</p>
               <p>The system of obligatory military service for all, introduced in 1874, has been
                    maintained, but the six years' term of service has been reduced to five, while
                    the privileges granted.to young men who have received various degrees of
                    education have been slightly extended. During the reign of Alexander III.
                    efforts were mainly directed towards—(1) reducing the time required for the
                    mobilization of the army; (2) increasing.the immediate readiness of cavalry for
                    war and its fitness for serving as mounted infantry (dragoon regiments taking
                    the place of hussars and lancers ; (3) strengthening the W. frontier by
                    fortresses .and railways; and (4) increasing the artillery, siege and train
                    reserves. Further, the age releasing from service was raised from 40 to 43 years
                    and the militia <hi rend="italic">(landsturm)</hi> was reorganized. The measures
                    taken during the reign of Nicholas II. have been chiefly directed towards
                    increasing tne fighting capacity and readiness for immediate service of the
                    troops in Asia,, and towards the better reorganization of the local irregular
                    militia forces. Broadly, speaking, the army is divided into regulars, Cossacks
                    and militia. The peace strength of the army is estimated at .42,000 officers and
                    1,100,000 men (about 950,000 combatants), while the war strength is
                    approximately 75,000 officers and 4,500,000 men. However, this latter figure is
                    merely nominal, the available artillery and train service being much below the
                    strength which would be required for such an army; estimates which put the
                    military forces of Russia in time of war at 2,750,000—irrespective of the armies
                    which may be levied during the war itself—seem to approach more nearly the
                    strength of the forces which could actually be mustered. The infantry and rifles
                    are armed with small-bore magazine rifles, and the active artillery have steel
                    breech-loaders</p>
               <p>with extreme ranges of 4150 to 4700 yds.</p>
               <p>Before the Japanese war Russia maintained four separate squadrons: the Baltic,
                    the Black Sea, the Pacific and the Caspian.</p>
               <p>But in the operations before Port Arthur and in the disastrous battle of
                    Tsushima the Russian fleets were almost completely annihilated. The bulk of the
                    Black Sea fleet and a few other battleships were, however, still left, and since
                    1904</p>
               <p>steps have been taken to build new ships, both battleships and</p>
               <p>gowerful cruisers. Kronstadt is the naval headquarters in the</p>
               <p>¡altic, Sevastopol in the Black Sea and Vladivostok on the Pacific.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Fortresses.—</hi> The chief first-class fortresses of Russia
                    are Warsaw and Novogeorgievsk in Poland, and Brest-Litovsk and Kovno in
                    Lithuania. The second-class fortresses are Kronstadt and Sveaborg in the Gulf of
                    Finland, Ivangorod in Poland, Libau on the Baltic Sea, Kerch on the Black Sea
                    and Vladivostok on the Pacific. In the third class are Viborg in Finland,
                    Ossovets and Ust Dvinsk (or Dtinamtinde) in Lithuania, Sevastopol and Ochakov on
                    the Black Sea, and Kars and Batum in Caucasia. There are, moreover, 46 forts and
                    fortresses unclassed, of which 6 are in Poland, 8 in W. and S.W. Russia, and the
                    remainder (mere fortified posts) in the Asiatic dominions.</p>
               <p>II. European Russia</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Geography.—</hi> The administrative boundaries of European
                    Russia, apart from Finland, coincide broadly with the natural limits of the
                    East-European plains. In the N. it is bounded by the Arctic Ocean; the islands
                    of Novaya-Zemlya, Kolguyevand Vaigach also belong to it, but the Kara Sea is
                    reckoned to Siberia. To the E. it has the Asiatic dominions of the empire,
                    Siberia and the Kirghiz steppes, from both of which it is separated by the Ural
                    Mountains, the Ural river and the Caspian—the administrative boundary, however,
                    partly extending into Asia on the Siberian slope of the Urals. To the S. it has
                    the Black Sea and Caucasia, being separated from the latter by the Manych
                    depression, which in Post-Pliocene times connected the Sea of Azov with the
                    Caspian. The W. boundary is purely conventional: it crosses the peninsula of
                    Kola from the Varanger Fjord to the Gulf of Bothnia; thence it runs to the
                    Kurisches Haff in the southern’Baltic, and thence to the mouth of the Danube,
                    taking a great circular sweep to the W. to embrace Poland, and separating Russia
                    from Prussia, Austrian Galicia and Rumania.</p>
               <p>It is a special feature of Russia that she has no free outlet to the open sea
                    except on the ice-bound shores of the Arctic Ocean. Even the White Sea is merely
                    a gulf of that ocean. The deep indentations of the gulfs of Bothnia and Finland
                    are surrounded by what is ethnologically Finnish territory, and it is only at
                    the very head of the latter gulf that the Russians have taken firm foothold by
                    erecting their capital at the mouth of the Neva. The Gulf of Riga and the Baltic
                    belong also to territory which is not inhabited by Slavs, but by Finnish races
                    and by Germans. It is only within the last hundred and thirty years that the
                    Russians have definitely taken possession of the N. shores of the Black Sea and
                    the Sea of Azov. The E. coast of the Black Sea belongs properly to
                    Transcaucasia, a great chain of mountains separating it from Russia. But even
                    this sheet of water is an inland sea, the only outlet of which, the Bosphorus,
                    is in foreign hands, while the Caspian, an immense shallow’ lake, mostly
                    bordered by deserts, possesses more importance as a link between Russia and her
                    Asiatic settlements than as a channel for intercourse with other countries.</p>
               <p>The great territory occupied by European Russia—1600 m. in length from N. to S.,
                    and nearly as much from E. to W.—is on the whole a broad elevated plain, ranging
                    between 500 and 900 ft. above sea-level, deeply cut into by river-valleys, and
                    bounded on all sides by broad swellings or low mountain-ranges: the lake
                    plateaus of Finland and the Maanselka heights in the N.W.; the Baltic
                    coast-ridge and spurs of the Carpathians in the W., with a broad depression
                    between the two, occupied by Poland; the Crimean and Caucasian mountains in the
                    S.; and the broad but moderately high swelling of the Ural Mountains in the E.</p>
               <p>From a central plateau, which comprises the governments of Tver, Moscow,
                    Smolensk and Kursk, and projects E. towards Samara, attaining an average
                    elevation of 800 to 900 ft. above the sea, the surface slopes gently in all
                    directions to a level of 300 to 500 ft. Then it again nses gradually as it
                    approaches the hilly tracts which enclose the great plain. This central swelling
                    may be considered a continuation towards the E.N.E. of the great line of
                    upheavals of N.W. Europe; the elevated grounds of Finland would then represent a
                    continuation of the Scanian plateaus of S. Sw'eden, and the northern mountains
                    of Finland a continuation of Kjfilen (the Keel) which separate Sweden from
                    Norway, while the other great line of</p>

                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r05-0880" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0943.jp2"/>
                <p>upheaval of the old continent, which runs N.W. to S.E., would be represented in
                    Russia by the Caucasus in the S. and by the Tinian ridge of the Pechora basin in
                    the N.</p>
               <p>The hilly aspect of several parts of the central plateau is not due to foldings
                    of the strata, which for the most part appear to be horizontal, but chiefly to
                    the. excavating action of the rivers, whose valleys are deeply eroded in the
                    plateau, especially on its borders. The round flattened summits of the Valdai
                    plateau do not rise above uoo ft., and they present the appearance of mountains
                    only in consequence of the depths of the. valleys—the rivers which flow towards
                    the depression of Lake Peipus being only 200 to 250 ft. above the sea. The same
                    is true of the plateaus of Livonia, “ Wendish Switzerland,” and the government
                    of Kovno, which do not exceed 1000 ft. atjtheir highest points; and again of the
                    E. spurs of the Baltic coast-ridge between the governments of Grodno and Minsk.
                    The same elevation is reached by a very few flat summits of the plateau about
                    Kursk, and farther E. on the Volga about Kamyshin, where the valleys are
                    excavated to a depth of 800 or 900 ft., giving quite a hilly aspect to the
                    country. It is only in the S.W., where spurs of the Carpathians enter the
                    governments of Volhynia, Podolia and Bessarabia, that ridges reaching uoo ft.
                    are met with, these again intersected by deep ravines.</p>
               <p>The depressions which gap the borders of the central plateau thus acquire a
                    greater importance than the small differences in its vertical elevation. Such is
                    the broad depression of the middle Volga and lower Kama, bounded on the N. by
                    the faint swelling of the Uval.y, the watershed between the Arctic Ocean and the
                    Volga basin. Another broad depression, 250 to 5°° ft* above the sea, still
                    filled by Lakes Peipus, Ladoga, Onega, Byelo-ozero, Lacha, Vozhe, and many
                    thousands of smaller lakes,.skirts the central plateau on the N., and follows
                    the same E.N.E. direction. Only a few low swellings penetrate into it from the
                    N.W., about Lake Onega, and reach 900 It., while in the N.E. it is enclosed by
                    the Timan ridge .(1000 ft.). A third depression, traversed by the Pripet and the
                    middle Dnieper, extends to the W. and penetrates into Poland. This immense
                    lacustrine basin is now broken up into numberless ponds, lakes and marshes (see
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Minsk).</hi> It is bounded on the S. by the broad
                    plateaus which spread out E. of the Carpathians. S. of 50° N. the central
                    plateau slopes gently towards tne S., and we find there a fourth depression
                    stretching W. and E. through Poltava and Kharkov, but still reaching in its
                    higher parts 500 to 700 ft. It is separated from the Black Sea by a gentle
                    swelling which may be traced from Kremenets in Volhynia to the lower Don, and
                    perhaps farther S.E. This swelling includes the Donets coal-measures and the
                    middle granitic ridges which give rise to the rapids of the Dnieper. Finally a
                    fifth depression, which descends below the level of the ocean, extends for more
                    than 200 m. to the N. of the Caspian, comprising the lower Volga and the Ural
                    and Emba rivers, and establishing a link between Russia and the Aral-Caspian
                    region. It is continued farther N. by plains below 300 ft., which join the
                    depression of the middle Volga, and extend as far as the mouth of the Oka.</p>
               <p>The Ural Mountains present the aspect of a broad swelling whose strata no longer
                    exhibit the horizontality which is characteristic of central Russia, and
                    moreover are deeply cut into by rivers. They are connected in the W. with broad
                    plateaus which join those of central Russia, but their orographical relations to
                    other upheavals must be more closely studied before they can be definitely
                    pronounced on.</p>
               <p>The rhomboidal peninsula of the .Crimea, connected by only a narrow isthmus with
                    the continent, is occupied by an arid plateau sloping gently N. and £., and
                    bordered on the S.E. by the Yaila Mountains, the summits of which range between
                    4000 and 5000 ft.</p>
               <p>Owing to the orographical structure of the East-European plains, the river
                    systems have become more than usually prominent and important features of the
                    configuration. Taking their origin from a series of lacustrine basins scattered
                    over the plateaus, and differing slightly in elevation, the Russian rivers
                    describe immense curves before reaching the sea, and flow with a very gentle
                    gradient, while numerous large tributaries collect their waters from over vast
                    areas. Thus the Volga, the Dnieper and the Don attain respectively lengths of
                    2325, 1410 and 1325 m., and their basins run to 563.300, 202,140 and 166,000 sq.
                    m. respectively. Moreover, the chief rivers, the Volga, the W. Dvina, the
                    Dnieper, and even the Lovat and the Oka, take their rise (in the N.W. of the
                    central plateau) so close to one another that they may be said to radiate from
                    the same centre. The sources of the Don interlace with the tributaries of the
                    Oka, while the upper tributaries of the Kama join those of the N. Dvina and
                    Pechora. In consequence of this, the rivers of Russia have been from remote
                    antiquity the principal channels of trade and migration, and have contributed
                    much more to the elaboration of national Unity than any political institutions.
                    Boats could be conveyed over flat and easy portages from one river-basin to
                    another, and these portages were subsequently transformed with a relatively
                    small amount of labour into navigable canals, and even at the present day the
                    canals have more importance for the traffic of the country than have most of the
                    railways. By their means the plains of the central plateau—the very heart of
                    Russia, whose natural outlet was the Caspian—were brought into
                    water-communication with the Baltic, and the Volga basin was connected with the
                    Gulf of Finland. The White Sea has also been brought into connexion with the
                    central Volga basin while the sister-river of the Volga—the Kama—became the main
                    artery of communication with Siberia.</p>
               <p>But although the rivers of Russia rank before the rivers of W. Europe in respect
                    of length, they arc far behind them as regards the volumes of water which they
                    discharge. They freeze in winter and dry. up in summer, and most of them are
                    navigable only, during the spring floods; even the Volga becomes so shallow
                    during the hot season that none but boats of light draught can pass over its
                    shoals.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Arctic Ocean Basin.—</hi> The Pechora rises in the N. Urals,
                    and enters the ocean by a large estuary at the Gulf of Pechora. Its basin,
                    thinly-peopled and available only for cattle-breeding and for hunting, is. quite
                    isolated from Russia by the Timan ridge. The river is navigable for 770 m.;
                    grain and a variety of goods conveyed from the upper Kama are floated down,
                    while furs, fish and other products of the sea are shipped up the river to be
                    transported to Cherdyn on the Kama. The Mezen enters the Bay of Mezen; it is
                    navigable for 450 m., and is the channel of a considerable export of timber. The
                    N. Dvina is formed by the union of the'Yug and the Sukhona. The latter,
                    although, it flows over a great number of rapids, is navigable throughout its
                    length. (330 m.); it is connected by canal with the Caspian and the Baltic. The
                    Vychegda, which flows W.S.W. to ioin the Sukhona,. through a woody region,
                    thinly peopled, is navigable for 500 m. and in its upper portion is connected by
                    a canal with the upper Kama. The N. Dvina flows with a very slight gradient
                    through a broad valley, and reaches the White Sea at Archangel. Notwithstanding
                    serious obstacles offered by shallows, corn, fish, salt and timber are largely
                    shipped to and from Archangel. The Onega, which flows into Onega Bay, has
                    rapids; but timber is floated down in spring, and fishing and some navigation
                    are carried on in the lower portion.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Baltic Basin.</hi> 'The Neva (40 m.) flows from Lake Ladoga
                    into the Gulf of Finland. The Volkhov, discharging into Lake Ladoga., and
                    forming part of the Vyshniy-Volochok system of canals, is an important channel
                    for navigation; it flows from Lake Ilmen, which receives the Msta, connected
                    with the Volga, and the Lovat. The Svir, also discharging into Lake Ladoga,
                    flows from Lake Onega, and, being part of the Mariinsk canal system, is of great
                    importance for navigation. The Narova flows out of Lake Peipus into the Gulf of
                    Finland at Narva; it has remarkable rapids, which are used to generate power for
                    cotton-mills; in spite of this, the river is navigated. Lake Peipus, or
                    Chudskoye, receives the Velikaya, a channel of traffic with S. Russia from a
                    remote antiquity, but now navigable only in its lower portion, and the Embach,
                    navigated by steamers to Dorpat (Yuryev). The S. Dvina, which falls into the sea
                    below Riga, is shallow above the rapids of Jacobstadt, but navigation is carried
                    on as far as Vitebsk—corn, timber, potash, flax, &amp;c., being the
                    principal shipments of its navigable tributaries (the Obsha, Ulla and Kasplya).
                    The Ulla is connected by the Berezina canals with the Dnieper. The Memel
                    (Nicmen), with a course of 470 m. in Russia, rises in the N. of Minsk, leaves
                    Russia at Yurburg, and enters the Kurisches Haff; rafts are floated upon it
                    almost from its source, and steamers ply as far as Kovno; it is connected by the
                    Oginsky canal with the Dnieper. For the Vistula, with the Bug and Narcw, see <hi

                    and separates Russia from Rumania; it enters the Danube, which flows along the
                    Russian frontier for 100 m. below Reni, touching it with its Kilia branch. The
                    Dniester (530 m. in Russia) rises in Galicia. Light boats and rafts are floated
                    at all points, and steamers ply on its lower portion; its estuary has important
                    fisheries. The Dnieper, with a basin of 202,140 sq. in., drains 13 governments,
                    the aggregate population of which numbers over 28,000,000. It also originates in
                    the N.W. parts of the central plateau, in the same marshy lakes, which give rise
                    to the Volga and the W. Dvina, and enters the Black Sea. In the middle navigable
                    part of its course, from Dorogo-buzh to Ekaterinoslav, it is an active channel
                    for traffic. It receives several large tributaries:—on the right, the Berezina,
                    connected with the W. Dvina, and the Pripet, both very important for
                    navigation—as well as several smaller tributaries on which rafts are floated; on
                    the left the Sozh, the Desna, one of the most important rivers of Russia,
                    navigated by steamers as far as Bryansk, the Sula, the Psiol and the Vorskla.
                    Below Ekaterinoslav the Dnieper flows for 46 m. over a series of rapids. At
                    Kherson it enters its long (40 m.) but shallow estuary, which receives the S.
                    Bug and the Ingut. The Don, with a basin of 166,000 sq. m., and navigable for
                    880 m., rises in the government of Tula and enters the Sea of Azov at Rostov,
                    after describing a great curve to the E. at Tsaritsyn, approaching the Volga,
                    with which it is connected by a railway (45 m.). Its navigation is of great
                    importance, especially for goods brought, from the Volga, and its fisheries are
                    extensive. The chief tributaries are the Sosna and North Donets on the right,
                    and the Voronezh, Khoper, Medvyeditsa and Manych on the left. The Ylya, the

               <p>The soil of Russia depends chiefly on the distribution of the boulder-clay and
                    loess, on the degree to which the rivers have severally excavated their valleys,
                    and on the moistness oí the climate. Vast areas in Russia are quite unfit for
                    cultivation, 19% of the aggregate surface of European Russia (apart from Poland
                    and Finland) being occupied by lakes, marshes, sand, &amp;c., 39% byj
                    forests, 16% by prairies, and only 26% being under cultivation. The distribution
                    of all these is, however, very unequal, and the five following subdivisions may
                    be established:— (1) the tundras; (2) the forest region; (3) the middle region,
                    comprising the surface available for agriculture and partly covered with
                    forests; (4) the black-earth <hi rend="italic">(chernozyom)</hi> region; and (5)
                    the steppes. Of these the black-earth region—about 150,000,000 acres—which
                    reaches from the Carpathians to the Urals, from the Pinsk marshes in the S.W. to
                    the upper Oka in the N.E., is the most important. It. is covered with a thick
                    sheet of black earth, a kind of loess, mixed with 5 to 15% of humus, due to the
                    decomposition of an herbaceous vegetation, which developed luxuriantly during
                    the Lacustrine period on a continent relatively dry even at that epoch. On the
                    three-fields system corn has been grown upon it for fifty to seventy consecutive
                    years without manure. Isolated black-earth islands, though less fertile, occur
                    also in Courland and Kovno, in the Oka-Volga-Kama depression, on the slopes of
                    the Urals, and in. a few patches in the N. Towards the Black Sea coast its
                    thickness diminishes, and it disappears in the valleys. In the extensive region
                    covered with boulder-clay the black earth appears only in isolated places, and
                    the soil consists for the most part of a sandy clay, containing a much smaller
                    admixture of humus. There cultivation is possible only with the aid of a
                    considerable quantity of manure. Drainage finding no outlet through the thick
                    clay, the soil of the forest region is often hidden beneath extensive marshes,
                    and the forests themselves are often mere thickets choking marshy ground; large
                    tracts of sand appear in the W., and the admixture of boulders w'ith. the clay
                    in the N.W. renders agriculture difficult. On the Arctic coast the forests
                    disappear, giving place to the tundras. Finally, in the S.E., towards the
                    Caspian, on the slopes of the southern Urals and the plateau of Obshchiy Syrt,
                    as also in the interior of the Crimea, and in several parts of Bessarabia, there
                    are large tracts</p>
               <p>of real desert, buried under coarse sand and devoid of vegetation.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the fact that Russia extends from N. to S. through 30 <hi
                        rend="sup">o</hi> of latitude, the climate of its different portions, apart
                    from the Crimea and Caucasia, presents a striking uniformity. The aerial
                    currents—cyclones, anti-cyclones and dry S.E. winds—prevail over extensive
                    areas, and sweep across the flat plains without hindrance. Everywhere the winter
                    is cold and the summer hot, both varying in their duration, but differing
                    relatively little in the extremes of temperature recorded. There is no place in
                    Russia, Archangel and Astrakhan included, where the thermometer does not rise in
                    summer nearly to 86° Fahr. and descend in winter to -13° and -22 <hi rend="sup"
                        >o</hi> . It is only on the Black Sea coast that the absolute range of
                    temperature does not exceed 108°, while in the remainder of Russia it reaches
                    126° to 141,, the oscillations being between -22 <hi rend="sup">o</hi> and -31
                    ®, occasionally going down as low as-54, and rising as high as 86° to 104°, or
                    even 109®. Everywhere the rainfall is small•. if Finland and Poland on the one
                    hand and Caucasia with the Caspian depression on the other be excluded, the
                    average yearly rainfall varies between 16 and 28 in. Nowhere docs the maximum
                    rainfall take place in winter (as in W. Europe), but it occurs in summer, and
                    everywhere the months of advanced spring are warmer</p>
               <p>than the corresponding months of autumn.</p>
               <p>Though thus exhibiting the distinctive features of a continental climate, Russia
                    does not lie altogether outside the reach of the moderating influence of the
                    ocean. The Atlantic cyclones penetrate to the Russian plains, mitigating to some
                    extent the cold of winter, and in summer bringing with them their moist winds
                    and thunderstorms. Their influence is chiefly felt in W. Russia, though it does
                    reach as far as the Urals and beyond. They thus check the extension and limit
                    the duration of the cold anticyclones.</p>
               <p>Throughout Russia the winter is of long duration. The last days of frost arc
                    experienced for the most part in April, but as late as May to the N. of 55° N.
                    The spring is exceptionally beautiful in central Russia; late as it usually is,
                    it sets in with vigour, and vegetation develops with a rapidity which gives to
                    this season in Russia a special charm, unknown in warmer climates. The rapid
                    melting of the snow at the same time causes the rivers to swell, and renders a
                    great many minor streams navigable for a few weeks. But a return of cold
                    weather, injurious to vegetation, is very frequently observed in central and E.
                    Russia between May the 18th and the 24th, so that it is only in June that warm
                    weather sets in definitely, and it reaches its maximum in the first half of July
                    (or of August on the Black Sea coast).. In S.E. Russia the summer is much warmer
                    than in the corresponding latitudes of France, and really hot weather is
                    experienced everywhere. It does not, however, prevail for long, and in the first
                    half of September frosts begin on the middle Urals. They descend upon W. and S.
                    Russia in the beginning of October, and arc felt on the Caucasus about the
                    middle of November. The temperature drops so rapidly that a month later, about
                    October the 10th on the middle Urals and November the 15th throughout Russia,
                    the thermometer ceases to rise above the freezing-point. The rivers freeze
                    rapidly; towards November 20th all tnc streams of the White Sea basin are
                    ice-bound, and so remain for an average of 167 days; those of the Baltic, Black
                    Sea and Caspian basins freeze later, but about December the 20th nearly all the
                    rivers of the country are highways for sledges. The Volga remains frozen for a
                    period varying between 150 days in the N. ana 90 days at Astrakhan, the Don for
                    100 to no days, and the Dnieper for 83 to 122 days. On the W. Dvina ice prevents
                    navigation for 125 days, and even the Vistula at Warsaw remains frozen for 77
                    days. The lowest temperatures are experienced in January, the average being as
                    low as 20® to 5° Fahr, throughout Russia; in the west only does it rise above
                    22®. On the whole, February and March continue to be cold, and their average
                    temperatures rise above zero nowhere except on the Black Sea coast.. Even at
                    Kiev and Lugansk the average of March is below 30°, while in central Russia it
                    is 25° to 22°, and as low as 20® and 16®. at Samara and Orenburg.</p>
               <p>All Russia is comprised between the isotherms of 32® and 54°. On the whole, they
                    are more remote from one another than even on the plains of J4. America, those
                    of 46® to 32® being distributed over twenty degrees of latitude. They are, on
                    the whole, inclined towards the S. in E. Russia; thus the isotherm of 39® runs
                    from St Petersburg to Orenburg, and that of 35® from Tomcä in Finland to Uralsk.
                    The inflexion is still greater for the winter isotherms. Closely following one
                    another, they run almost N. and S.; thus Odessa and Königsberg are situated on
                    the same winter isotherm of 28®; St Petersburg, Orel and the mouth of the Ural
                    river on about 20®; and Mezen and Ufa on 9®. The summer isotherms cross the
                    winter isotherms nearly at right angles, so that Kiev and Ufa, Warsaw and
                    Tobolsk, Riga and the upper Kama have the same average summer temperatures of
                    64®, 62^® and 61® respectively.</p>
               <p>The laws and relations of the cyclones and anti-cyclones in Russia are not yet
                    thoroughly understood. It appears, however, that in January the cyclones mostly
                    travel across N.W. Russia (N. of 55° and W. of 40® E.), following directions
                    which vary between N.E. and S.E. In July they are pushed farther towards the N.,
                    and cross the Gulf of Bothnia, while another series of cyclones sweep across
                    middle. Russia, between 50° and 55® N. Nor are the laws of the anti-cyclones
                    established. The winds closely depend on the routes, followed by both.
                    Generally, however, it may be said that alike in January, and in July W. and
                    S.W. winds prevail in W. Russia, while E. winds arc most common in S.E. Russia.
                    N. winds are predominant on the Black Sea coast. The strength of the wind is
                    greater, on. the whole, than in the continental parts of W. Europe, and it
                    attains its maximum velocity in winter. Terrible tempests blow from October to
                    March, especially on the S. steppes ana on the tundras. Hurricanes accompanied
                    with snow (&amp;M/ans, <hi rend="italic">myatels),</hi> and lasting from two
                    to three days, or N. blizzards without snow, are especially dangerous to man and
                    beast. The average relative moisture reaches 80 to 85% in the N., and only 70 to
                    81 % in S. and E. Russia. In the steppes it is only 60% during summer, and still
                    less (57) at Astrakhan. The average amount of cloud is 73 to 75% on the White
                    Sea and in Lithuania, 68 to 64 in central Russia, and only. 59 to 53 in the S.
                    and S.E. The 'amount of rainfall is shown in the Table on next page. <note

               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Arctic Region</hi> comprises the tundras of the Arctic
                    littoral beyond the N. limit of the forests, which closely follows the
                    coastline, with deviations towards the N. in the river valleys (70° N. in
                    Finland and on the Arctic Circle about Archangel, 68° N. on the Urals, 71 <hi
                        rend="sup">0</hi> in W. Siberia). The shortness of the summer, the
                    deficiency of drainage and the depth to which the soil freezes in winter, are
                    the circumstances which determine the characteristic features of the vegetation
                    of the tundras. Their flora is far closer akin to the floras of N. Siberia and
                    N. America than to that of central Europe. Mosses and lichens are distinctive,
                    as also are the birch, the dwarf willow and several shrubs; but where the soil
                    is drier, and humus has been able to accumulate, a variety of herbaceous
                    flowering plants, some of them familiar in W. Europe, make their appearance.
                    Only 275 to 280 phanerogams are found within this region..</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Forest Region of</hi> the Russian botanists includes the
                    greater part of the country, from the Arctic tundras to the steppes, and over
                    this immense expanse it maintains a remarkable uniformity of character. Beketov
                    subdivides it into two portions—the forest region proper and the “ Ante-Steppe ”
                        <hi rend="italic">(Predstepie).</hi> The N. limit of the ante-steppe is
                    represented by a line drawn from the Pruth through Zhitomir, Kursk, Tambov and
                    Stavropol-on-Volga to the sources of the Ural river. But the forest region
                    proper presents a different aspect in the N. from that in the S., and must in
                    turn be subdivided into two parts— the coniferous region and the region of the
                    oak forests—these being separated by a line drawn through Pskov, Kostroma, Kazan
                    and Ufa. Of course the oak occurs farther. N. than this, and coniferous forests
                    extend farther S., advancing even to the border-region of the steppes. To the N.
                    of this line the forests are of great extent and densely grown, more frequently
                    diversified by marshes than by meadows or cultivated fields. Vast and
                    impenetrable forests, impassable marches and thickets, numerous lakes, swampy
                    meadows, with cleared and dry spaces here and there occupied by. villages, are
                    the leading features of this region. Fishing and hunting are the most important
                    sources of livelihood. The characteristics of the oak region, which comprises
                    all central Russia, are totally different. The surface is undulatory ; marshy
                    meadow lands no longer exist on the flat watersheds, and only a few in the
                    deeper and broader river valleys. Forests are still numerous where they have not
                    been destroyed by the hand of man, but their character has changed. Conifers are
                    rare, and the Scotch pine, which is abundant on the sandy plains, takes the
                    place of the <hi rend="italic">Abies.</hi> The forests are composed of the
                    birch, oak and other deciduous trees, the soil is dry, and the woodlands are
                    divided by green prairies. Viewed from rising ground, the landscape presents a
                    pleasing variety of cornfield and forest, while the horizon is broken by the
                    bell-towers of the numerous villages strung along the banks of the streams.</p>
               <p>Viewed as a whole, the flora of the forest region is to be regarded as
                    European-Siberian; and, though certain species disappear towards the E., while
                    new ones make their appearance, it maintains, on the whole, the same features
                    throughout from Poland to Kamchatka. . Thus the beech <hi rend="italic">(Fagus
                        sylvatica)</hi> is unable to survive the continental climate of Russia, and
                    does not penetrate beyond Poland and the S.W. provinces, reappearing again in
                    the Crimea. The silver fir does not extend over Russia, and the oak does not
                    cross the Urals. On the other hand, several Asiatic species (Siberian pine,
                    larch, cedar) grow freely in the N.E., while numerous shrubs and herbaceous
                    plants, originally from the Asiatic steppes, have found their way into the S.E.
                    But all these do not greatly alter the general character of the vegetation. The
                    coniferous forests of the north contain, besides conifers, the birch <hi
                        rend="italic">(Betula alba, Β. pub-escens, B. fruticosa</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">B. verrucosa),</hi> which extends from the Pechora to the
                    Caucasus, the aspen, two species of alder, the mountain-ash <hi rend="italic"

                    the rapidity with which it is being exterminated, constitutes entire forests in
                    the east (central Volga, Ufa). Farther S. the ash <hi rend="italic">(Fraxinus
                        excelsior)</hi> and the oak make their appearance, the latter <hi
                        rend="italic">(Quercus pedunculate)</hi> reaching in isolated groups and
                    single trees as far N. as St Petersburg and South Finland (Q. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Robur</hi> appears only in the S.W.). The hornbeam is prevalent in the
                    Ukraine, and the maple begins to appear in the S. of the coniferous region. In
                    the forest region no fewer than 772 flowering species are found, of which 568
                    dicotyledons occur in the Archangel government (only 436 to the E. of the White
                    Sea, which is a botanical limit for many species). In central Russia the species
                    become still more numerous, and, though the local floras are not yet complete,
                    they number 850 to 1050 species in the separate governments, and about 1600 in
                    the best explored parts of the S.W. Corn is cultivated throughout this region.
                    Its N. limits advance almost to the Arctic coast at Var-anger Fjord, farther E.
                    they hardly reach N. of Archangel, and the limit is still lower towards the
                    Urals. The N. boundary of rye closely corresponds to that of barley. Wheat is
                    cultivated in S. Finland, but in W. Russia it hardly gets N. of 58° N. Its true
                    domains are the oak region and the steppes. Fruit trees are cultivated as far as
                    62° N. in Finland, and as far as 58° in the E. Apricots and walnuts flourish at

                    are grown throughout the oak region.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Region of the Steppes,</hi> which is coincident with the
                    whole of S. Russia, may be subdivided into two zones—an intermediate zone and
                    that of the steppes proper. The ante-steppe of the preceding region and the
                    intermediate zone of the steppes include those tracts in which the W. European
                    climate contends against the Asiatic, and where a struggle is carried on between
                    the forest and the steppe. It is comprised between the summer isotherms of 59°
                    and 63°, being bounded on the S. by a line which runs through Ekaterinoslav and
                    Lugansk. S. of this line begin the steppes proper, which extend to the sea and
                    penetrate to the foot of the Caucasus.</p>
               <p>Ihe steppes proper are very fertile, elevated plains, slightly undulating, and
                    intersected by numerous ravines which are dry in summer. The undulations are
                    scarcely apparent. Not a tree is to be seen, the few woods and thickets being
                    hidden in the depressions and deep valleys of the rivers. On the thick layer of
                    black earth by which the steppe is covered a luxuriant vegetation develops in
                    spring; after the old grass has been burned a bright green prevails over immense
                    stretches, but this rapidly disappears under the burning rays of the sun and the
                    hot E. winds. The colouring of the steppe changes as if by magic, and only the
                    silvery plumes of the steppe-grass <hi rend="italic">(Stipa pennate)</hi> wave
                    in the wind, tinting the steppe a bright yellow. For days together the traveller
                    sees no other vegetation; even this, however, disappears as he approaches the
                    regions recently left dry by the Caspian, where saline clays, bearing a few
                    Salsolaceae, or mere sand, take the place of the black earth. Here begins the
                    Aral-Caspian desert. The steppe, however, is not so devoid of trees as at first
                    sight appears. Innumerable clusters of wild cherries <hi rend="italic">(Prunus
                        Chamaecerasus),</hi> wild apricots <hi rend="italic">(Amygdalus nana),</hi>
                    the Siberian pea-tree <hi rend="italic">(Caragana fru-tescens),</hi> and other
                    deep-rooted shrubs grow at the bottoms of the depressions and on the slopes of
                    the ravines, imparting to the steppe that charm which manifests itself in the
                    popular poetry. Unfortunately the spread of cultivation is fatal to these oases
                    (they are often called “ islands ” by the inhabitants) ; the axe and the plough
                    ruthlessly destroy them.</p>
               <p>The vegetation in the marshy bottoms of the ravines and in the valleys of the
                    streams and rivers is totally different. The moist soil encourages luxuriant
                    thickets of willows (Salicineae), surrounded by dense <hi rend="italic"
                        >chevaux-de-frise</hi> of wormwood and thorn-bearing Compositae, and
                    interspersed with rich but not extensive prairies, harbouring a great variety of
                    herbaceous plants; while in the deltas of the Black Sea rivers impenetrable beds
                    of reeds <hi rend="italic">(Arundo phragmites)</hi> shelter a forest fauna. But
                    cultivation rapidly changes the physiognomy of the steppe. The prairies are
                    superseded by wheat-fields, and flocks of sheep destroy the true steppe-grass
                        <hi rend="italic">(Stipa pennate).</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A great many species unknown in the forest region make their appearance in the
                    steppes. The Scotch pine still grows on all sandy spaces, and the maple <hi
                        rend="italic">(Acer teterica</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A. campestre),</hi>
                    the hornbeam and the black and white poplar are very common. The number of
                    species of herbaceous plants rapidly increases, while beyond the Volga a variety
                    of Asiatic species are added to the W. European flora.</p>

                    Mediterranean coast, has permitted the' development of a flora closely
                    resembling that of the valley of the Arno in Italy. Human cultivation has
                    destroyed the abundant forests which sixty years ago made deer-hunting possible
                    at Khersones. The olive and the chestnut are rare; but the beech reappears, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Pinus pinaster</hi> recalls the Italian pines. At a few
                    points, such as Nikita near Livadia and Alupka, where plants have been

                    flourish. The grass vegetation is very rich, and, according to lists still
                    incomplete, no fewer than 1654 flowering plants are known. But on the whole, the
                    Crimean flora has little in common with that of the Caucasus. <note

               <p>Russia belongs to the same zoo-geographical region as central Europe and N.
                    Asia, the same fauna extending in Siberia as far as the Yenisei and the Lena. In
                    the forests not many animals which have disappeared from W. Europe have held
                    their ground; while in the Urals only a few—now Siberian, but formerly also
                    European—are met with. In S.E.. Russia, however, towards the Caspian, there is a
                    notable admixture of Asiatic species. Three separate sub-regions may, however,
                    be distinguished on the E. European plains—the tundras, including the Arctic
                    islands, the forest region, especially the coniferous part. of it, and the
                    ante-steppe and steppes of the black earth region. The Ural Mountains might be
                    distinguished as a fourth sub-region, while the S. coast of the Crimea and
                    Caucasia, as well as the Caspian</p>
               <p>deserts, have each their own individuality.</p>
               <p>The fauna of the Arctic Ocean off the Norwegian coast corresponds, in its W.
                    parts at least, to that of the N. Atlantic Gulf Stream. The White Sea and the
                    Arctic Ocean to the E.of Svyatoi Nos on the Kola peninsula belong to a separate
                    zoological region, connected with, and hardly separable from, that part of the
                    Arctic Ocean which washes the Siberian coast as far as the mouth of the Lena.
                    The Black Sea, the fauna of which appears to be very rich, belongs to the
                    Mediterranean region, slightly modified, while the Caspian partakes of the
                    characteristic fauna inhabiting the lakes and seas of the Aral-Caspian
                    depression.</p>
               <p>In the region of the tundras life has to contend with such unfavourable
                    conditions that it cannot be abundant. Still, the reindeer frequents it for its
                    lichens, and on the drier slopes of the moraine deposits there occur four
                    species of lemming, hunted by the Arctic fox <hi rend="italic">(Vulpes Iago
                        pus).</hi> The willow-grouse <hi rend="italic">(Lagopus albus),</hi> the
                    ptarmigan (L. <hi rend="italic">alpinus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mutus),</hi>
                    the lark, the snowbunting <hi rend="italic">(Plectrophancs nivalis),</hi> two or
                    three species of <hi rend="italic">Sylvia,</hi> one <hi rend="italic"

                    Numberless aquatic birds visit it for breeding purposes. Ducks, divers, geese,
                    gulls, all the Russian species of snipes and sandpipers <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Limicolae, Tringae),</hi> &amp;c., swarm on the marshes of the tundras
                    and on the crags of the Lapland coast. .</p>
               <p>The forest region, and especially its coniferous portion, though it has lost
                    some of its representatives within historic times, still possesses an abundant
                    fauna. The reindeer, rapidly disappearing, is now met with only in the
                    governments of Olonets and Vologda; <hi rend="italic">Cervus pygargus</hi> is
                    found everywhere, and reaches Novgorod. The weasel, the fox and the hare are
                    exceedingly common, as also are the wolf and the bear in the N., but the glutton
                        <hi rend="italic">(Gulo borealis),</hi> the lynx and the elk <hi
                        rend="italic">(C. aloes)</hi> are rapidly disappearing. The wild boar is
                    confined to the basin of the W. Dvina, and the <hi rend="italic">Bison
                        europea</hi> to the Byelovyezh forest in Grodno. The sable has quite
                    disappeared, being found only on the Urals; the beaver may be trapped at a few
                    places in Minsk, and the otter is very rare. On the other hand, the hare, grey
                    partridge <hi rend="italic">(Perdix cinerea),</hi> hedgehog, quail, lark, rook
                    and stork find their way into the. coniferous region as the forests arc cleared.
                    The avifauna of. this region is very rich; it includes all the forest and garden
                    birds known in W. Europe, as well as a very great variety of aquatic birds. A
                    list, still incomplete, of the birds of St Petersburg runs to 251 species.
                    Hunting and shooting give occupation to a great number of persons. The reptiles
                    are few. As for fishes, all those of W. Europe, except the carp, are met with in
                    the lakes and rivers in immense quantities, the characteristic feature of the
                    region being its wealth in <hi rend="italic">Coregoni</hi> and in Salmonidae
                    generally.</p>
               <p>In the ante-steppe the forest species proper, such as <hi rend="italic">Pteromys
                        volans</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tamias striatus,</hi> disappear, but
                    common squirrel <hi rend="italic">(Sciurus vulgaris),</hi> weasel and bear are
                    still met with in the forests. The hare ¡s increasing rapidly, as well as the
                    fox. The avifauna, of course, becomes poorer; nevertheless, the woods of the
                    steppe, and still more the forests of the ante-steppe, give refuge to many</p>
               <p>birds, even to hazel-hen <hi rend="italic">(Tetrao bonasa),</hi> capercailzie
                    (F. <hi rend="italic">tetrix)</hi> and woodcock (F. <hi rend="italic"
                        >urogallus).</hi> The fauna of the scrub in the river valleys is decidedly
                    rich, and includes aquatic birds. The destruction of the forests and the advance
                    of wheat into the prairies are rapidly thinning the steppe fauna. The various
                    species of rapacious animals are disappearing, together with the colonies of
                    marmots; the insectivores are also becoming scarce in consequence of the
                    destruction of insects; while vermin, such as the suslik, or pouched marmot <hi
                        rend="italic">(Sperrnophilus),</hi> and the destructive insects which arc a
                    scourge to agriculture, become a real plague. The absence of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Coregoni</hi> is a characteristic feature of the fish-fauna of the steppes;
                    the carp, on the contrary, reappears, and the rivers abound in sturgeon
                    (Acipenseridae). In the Volga below Nizhniy-Novgorod the sturgeon <hi

                    appear in such quantities that they give occupation to nearly 100,coo people.
                    The mouths of the Caspian rivers are especially celebrated for their wealth of
                    fish. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="38"> Bibliography

                    with the large Quaternary mammals, are few in Russia; they have been discovered
                    only in Poland, Poltava and Voronezh, and perhaps also on the Oka. Those of the
                    later Lacustrine period, on the contrary, are so numerous that there is scarcely
                    one lacustrine basin in the regions of the Oka, the Kama, the Dnieper, not to
                    speak of the lake-region itself, and even the White Sea coasts, where remains of
                    Neolithic man have not been discovered. The Russian plains have been, however,
                    the scene of so many migrations of successive races, that at many places a
                    series of deposits belonging to widely distant epochs are found one upon
                    another. Settlements belonging to the Stone age, and manufactories of stone
                    implements, burial-grounds of the Bronze epoch, earthen forts and burial-mounds

                    known, the’earliest belonging to the Bronze period—are superposed, rendering the
                    task of unravelling their several relations one of great difficulty.</p>
               <p>Two different races—a brachycephalic and a dolichocephalic— can be distinguished
                    among the remains of the earlier Stone period (Lacustrine period) as having
                    inhabited the plains of E. Europe. But they are separated by so many generations
                    from the earliest historic times that sure conclusions regarding them are
                    impossible; at all events, as yet Russian archaeologists are not agreed as to
                    whether the ancestors of the Slavs were Sar-matians only or Scythians also,
                    whose skulls have nothing in common with those of the Mongol race. The earliest
                        <hi rend="italic">data</hi> which may be regarded as established belong to
                    the 1st century, when the Finns migrated from the N. Dvina region towards the
                    W., and the Sarmatians were compelled to abandon the region of the Don, and
                    cross the Russian steppes from E. to W., under the pressure of the Aorzes (the
                    Mordvinian Erzya) and Siraks, who in their turn were soon followed by the Huns
                    and Uigur-Turkish Avars.</p>
               <p>In the 7th century S. Russia was the seat of the empire of the Khazars, who
                    drove the Bulgarians, descendants of the Huns, from the Don, one section of them
                    migrating up the Volga to found there the Bulgarian empire, and the remainder
                    travelling towards the Danube. This migration compelled the N. Finns to advance
                    farther W., and a body of intermingled Tavasts and Karelians penetrated to the
                    S. of the Gulf of Finland.</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r05-0884" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0947.jp2"/>
               <p>As early as the 8th century, and probably still earlier, a stream of Slav
                    colonization, advancing E. from the Danube, poured over the plains of S.W.
                    Russia. It is also most probable that another similar stream—the N., coming from
                    the Elbe, through the basin of the Vistula—ought to be distinguished. In the 9th
                    century the Slavs occupied the upper Vistula, the S. of the Russian lacustrine
                    region, and the W. of the central plateau. They had Lithuanians to the W.;
                    various Finnish tribes, intermingled towards the S.E. with Turkish (the present
                    Bashkirs); the Bulgars, whose origin still remains doubtful, on the middle Volga
                    and Kama; and to the S.E. the Turkish-Mongol races of the Pechencgs, Polovtsi,
                    Uzes, &amp;c., while in the S., along the Black Sea, was the empire of the
                    Khazars, who had under their rule several Slav tribes, and perhaps also some of
                    Finnish origin. In the 9th century also the Ugrians are supposed to have left
                    their Ural abodes and to have traversed S.E. and S. Russia on their way to the
                    basin of the Danube. If the Slavs be subdivided into three hranches—the W.
                    (Poles, Czechs and Wends), the S. (Servians,Bulgarians, Croatians,
                    &amp;c.),and the E. (Great, Little and White Russians), it will be seen
                    that, with the exception of some 3,000,000 Little Russians, now settled in East
                    Galicia and in Poland, and of a few on the southern slope of the Carpathians,
                    the whole of the E. Slavs occupy, as a compact body, W., central and S. Russia.</p>
               <p>Like other races of mankind, the Russian race is not pure. The Russians have
                    absorbed and assimilated in the course of their history a variety of Finnish and
                    Turko-Finnish elements. Still, craniological researches show that,
                    notwithstanding this fact, the Slav type has been maintained with remarkable
                    persistency: Slav skulls ten and thirteen centuries old exhibit the same
                    anthropological features as those which characterize the Slavs of our own day.
                    This may be explained by a variety of causes, of which the chief is the
                    maintenance by the Slavs down to a very late period of gentile or tribal
                    organization and gentile marriages, a fact vouched for, not only in the pages of
                    the Russian chronicler Nestor, but still more by visible social evidences, the
                        <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> later developing into the village community, and
                    the colonization being carried on by large co-ordinated bodies of people. The
                    Russians do not emigrate as isolated individuals; they migrate in whole
                    villages. The overwhelming numerical superiority of the Slavs, and the very
                    great differences in ethnical type, belief and mythology between the
                    Indo-European and the Ural-Altaic races, may have contributed to the same end.
                    Moreover, while a Russian man, far away from home among Siberians, readily
                    marries a native, the Russian woman seldom does the like. All these causes, and
                    especially the first-mentioned, have enabled the Slavs to maintain their
                    ethnical purity in a relatively high degree, whereby they have been enabled to
                    assimilate foreign elements and make them intensify or improve the ethnical
                    type, without giving rise to half-breed races. The very same N. Russian type has
                    thus been maintained from Novgorod to the Pacific, with but minor
                    differentiations on the outskirts—and this notwithstanding the great variety of
                    races with which the Russians have come into contact. But a closer observation
                    of what is going on in the recently colonized confines of the empire—where whole
                    villages live without mixing with the natives, but slowly bringing them over to
                    the Russian manner of life, and then slowly taking in a few female elements from
                    them—gives the key to this feature of Russian life.</p>
               <p>Not so with the national customs. There are features—the wooden house, the oven,
                    the bath—which the Russian never abandons, even when swamped in an alien
                    population. But when settled among these the Russian—the N. Russian— readily
                    adapts himself to many other differences. He speaks Finnish with Finns,
                    Mongolian with Buriats, Ostiak with Ostiaks; he shows remarkable* facility in
                    adapting his agricultural practices to new conditions, without, however,
                    abandoning the village community; he becomes hunter, cattle-breeder or
                    fisherman, and carries on these occupations according to local usage; he
                    modifies his dress and adapts his religious beliefs to the locality he inhabits.
                    In consequence of all this, the Russian peasant (not, he it noted, the trader)
                    proves himself to be an excellent colonist.</p>
               <p>Three different branches can be distinguished among the Russians from the dawn
                    of their history:—the Great Russians, the Little Russians (Malorusses or
                    Ukrainians), and the White Russians (the Byelorusses). These correspond to the
                    two currents of immigration mentioned above—the N.’and S., with perhaps an
                    intermediate stream, the proper place of the White Russians not having been as
                    yet exactly determined. The primary distinctions between these branches have
                    been increased during the last nine centuries by their contact with different
                    nationalities—the Great Russians absorbing Finnish elements, the Little Russians
                    undergoing an admixture ol Turkish blood, and the White Russians submitting to
                    Lithuanian influence. Moreover, notwithstanding the unity of language, it is
                    easy to detect among the Great Russians themselves two separate branches,
                    differing from one another by slight divergences of language and type and deep
                    diversities of national character—the Central Russians and the Novgorodians. The
                    latter extend throughout N. Russia into Siberia. Many minor anthropological
                    differentiae can be distinguished among both the Great ana the Little Russians,
                    depending probably on the assimilation of various minor subdivisions of the
                    Ural-Altaians.</p>
               <p>The Great Russians occupy in one compact mass the space enclosed by a line drawn
                    from the White Sea to Like Pskov, the upper courses of the W. Dvina and the
                    Donets, and thence, through the mouth of the Sura, by the Vetluga, to the Mezen.
                    To the E. of this boundaiy they are intermingled with Turko-Finns, but in the
                    Ural mountains they reappear in a second compact body, and thence extend through
                    S. Siberia and along the courses of the Lena and the Amur. Great Russian
                    Nonconformists are disseminated among Little Russians in the governments of
                    Chernigov and Mogilev, and they reappear in greater masses in Novoroissa <hi
                        rend="italic">(i.e.</hi> S. Russia), as also in N. Caucasia.</p>
               <p>The Little Russians occupy the steppes of S. Russia, the S.W. slopes of the
                    central plateau and those of the Carpathian and Lublin mountains, and the
                    Carpathian plateau, that is, the governments of Podolia, Volhynia, Poltava, and
                    Kiev. The Zaporozhian Cossacks colonized the steppes farther E., towards the
                    Don, where they met with a large population of Great Russian runaways,
                    constituting the present Don Cossacks. The Zaporozhian Cossacks, sent by
                    Catherine II. to colonize the E. coast of the Sea of Azov, constituted there the
                    Black Sea and later the Kuban Cossacks (part of whom, the Nekrasovsty, migrated
                    to Turkey). They have also peopled large parts of the government of Stavropol
                    and of N. Caucasia.</p>
               <p>The White Russians, intermingled to some extent with Great and Little Russians,
                    Poles and Lithuanians, occupy the upper parts of the W. slope of the central
                    plateau.</p>
               <p>The Finnish races, which in prehistoric times extended from the Ob all over N.
                    Russia, even then were subdivided into Ugrians, Permyaks, Bulgarians and Finns
                    proper, who drove back the previous Lapp population from what is now Finland,
                    and about the 7th century penetrated to the S. of the Gulf of Finland, in the
                    region of the Livs and Kurs, where they fused to some extent with the
                    Lithuanians and the Letts. At present the races of Finnish origin are
                    represented in Russia by the following: (a) the W. Finns; the Tavasts, in
                    central Finland; the Kvaens, in N.W. Finland; the Karelians, in the E., who also
                    occupy the lake regions of Olonets and Archangel, and have settlements in
                    Novgorod and Tver; the Izhores, on the Neva and the S.E. coast of the Gulf of
                    Finland; the Esths, in Esthonia and the N. of Livonia; the Livs, on the Gulf of
                    Riga; and the Kurs, intermingled with the Letts; (6) the N. Finns, or Lapps, in
                    N. Finland and on the Kola peninsula, and the Samoyedes in Archangel and W.
                    Siberia; (c) the Volga Finns, or rather the old Bulgarian branch, to which
                    belong the Mordvinians, and the Cheremisses in Kazan, Kostroma and Vyatka,
                    though they are classified by some authors with the following: (&lt;Z) the
                    Permyaks, or Cis-Uralian Finns, including the Votiaks on the E. of Vyatka, the
                    Permyaks in Perm, the Syryenians or Zyryans in Vologda, Archangel, Vyatka and
                    Perm; (e) the Ugrians, or Trans-Uralian Finns, including the Voguls on both
                    slopes of the Urals, the Ostiaks in Tobolsk and partly in.Tomsk, and the
                    Magyars, or Ugrians.</p>
               <p>The following are the chief subdivisions of the Turko-Tatars in European Russia
                    :—(1) The Tatars, of whom three different branches must be distinguished: (a)
                    the Kazan Tatars on both banks of the Volga, below the mouth of the Oka, and on
                    the lower Kama, but penetrating farther S. in Ryazan, Tambov, Samara, Simbirsk
                    and Penza; (6) the Tatars of Astrakhan at the mouth of the Volga; and (c) those
                    of the Crimea, a great many of whom emigrated to Turkey after the Crimean War
                    (1854-56). There are, besides, a certain number of Tatars in.the S.E. in Minsk,
                    Grodno and Vilna. (2) The Bashkirs, who inhabitkthe slopes of the S. Urals, that
                    is, the steppes of Ufa and Orenburg, extend also into Perm and Samara. (3) The
                    Chuvashes, on the right bank of the Volga, in Kazan and Simbirsk. (4) The
                    Meshcheryaks, -a tribe of Finnish origin who formerly inhabited the basin of the
                    Oka, and, driven thence during the 15th century by the Russian colonists,
                    immigrated into Ufa and Perm, where they now live among tne Baskhirs, having
                    adopted their religion and customs. (5) The Teptyars, also of Finnish origin,</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r05-0885" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0948.jp2"/>
               <p>settled among the Tatars and Bashkirs in Samara and Vyatka. The Bashkirs,
                    Meshcheryaks and Teptyars rendered able service to the Russian government
                    against the Khirgiz, and until 1863 they constituted a separate Cossack army.
                    (6). The Khirgiz, whose true abodes were in Asia, in the Ishim and Khirgiz
                    steppe. One section of them crossed the Urals and occupied the steppes between
                    the Urak and the Volga; the remainder belong to Turkestan and Siberia.</p>
               <p>The Mongol race is represented in Russia by the Kalmucks, who inhabit the
                    steppes of Astrakhan between the Volga, the Don and the Kuma. They are Lamaists
                    by religion and immigrated to the mouth of the Volga from Dzungaria, in. the
                    17th century, driving out the Tatars and Nogais, and after many wars with the
                    Don Cossacks, one part of them was taken in by the Don Cossacks, so that even
                    now there are among these Cossacks several Kalmuck <hi rend="italic">Sotnias
                        QT</hi> squadrons. They live for the most part in tents, and support
                    themselves by breeding live stock, and partly by agriculture.</p>
               <p>The Semitic race is represented by upwards of 5,000,000 Jews. They first entered
                    Poland from Germany during the era of the crusades, and soon spread through
                    Lithuania, Courland, the Ukraine, and, in the 18th century, Bessarabia. The
                    rapidity with which they peopled certain towns <hi rend="italic">(e.g.</hi>
                    Odessa) and the whole provinces was really prodigious. The law of Russia
                    prohibits them from entering Great Russia, only the wealthiest and best educated
                    enjoying this privilege; nevertheless they are met with everywhere, even on the
                    Urals. Their chief abodes,, however, continue to be Poland, the W. provinces of
                    Lithuania, White and Little Russia, and Bessarabia. In Russian Poland they
                    constitute 13!% of the total population. In Kovno, Vilna, Mogilev, Grodno,
                    Volhynia, Podolia, Minsk, Vitebsk, Kiev, Bessarabia and Kherson, they
                    constitute, on the average, 12 to I7Î % of the population, while in the cities
                    and towns of these governments they reach 30 to 59% of the population. Organized
                    as they are into a kind of community for mutual protection and mutual help, they
                    soon become masters of the trade wherever they penetrate. In the villages they
                    are mostly innkeepers, intermediaries in trade and pawnbrokers. In many towns
                    most of the skilled labourers and a great many of the unskilled (for instance,
                    the grain-porters at Odessa and elsewhere) are Jews.</p>
               <p>The Jews of the Karaite sect differ entirely from the orthodox Jews both in
                    WOrship and in mode of life. They, too, are inclined to trade, but they also
                    carry on agriculture successfully. Those inhabiting the Crimea speak Tatar, and
                    the few who are settled in W. Russia speak Polish. They are on good terms with
                    the Russians.</p>
               <p>Of W. Europeans, the Germans only attain considerable numbers in European
                    Russia. In the Baltic provinces they constitute the ennobled landlord class, and
                    are the tradesmen and artisans in the towns. Considerable, numbers of Germans,
                    tradesmen and artisans, settled at the invitation of the Russian government in
                    many of the larger towns as early as the 16th century, and to a much greater
                    extent in the 18th century. Numbers were invited in 1762 to settle in S. Russia,
                    as separate, agricultural colonies, and these have since then gradually extended
                    into the Don region and N. Caucasia. Protected as they were by the right of
                    self-government, exempted from military service, and endowed with. considerable
                    allotments of good land, these colonies are much wealthier than the neighbouring
                    Russian peasants, from whom they have adopted the slowdy modified village
                    community.. They are chiefly Lutherans, but many of them belong to other
                    religious sects—Anabaptists, Moravians, Mennonites. During the closing years of
                    the 19th century great numbers of Germans flocked into the industrial
                    governments of Poland, namely, Piotrkow, Warsaw and Kalisz.</p>
               <p>The Rumanians (Moldavians) inhabit the governments of Bessarabia, Podolia,
                    Kherson and Ekaterinoslav. In Bessarabia they constitute from one-fourth to
                    three-fourths of the population of certain districts, and nearly 50% of the
                    entire population of the government. On the whole the Novorossian governments
                    (Bessarabia, Kherson, Ekaterinoslav. and Taurida) exhibit the greatest variety
                    of population. Little and Great Russians, Rumanians, Bulgarians, Germans,
                    Greeks, Frenchmen, Poles, Tatars and Jews are mingled together and scattered
                    about in small colonies, especially in Bessarabia. The Greeks inhabit chiefly
                    the towns, where they are traders, as also do the Armenians, scattered through
                    the towns of S. Russia, and appearing in larger numbers only in the district of
                    Rostov.</p>
               <p>The Lithuanians prevail in Kovno, Vilna and Suwalki; and the Letts, who are,

                    Livonia.</p>
               <p>In the Baltic provinces (Esthonia, Livonia and Courland) the prevailing
                    population. is Esthonian, Kuronian or Lettish, the Germans being respectively
                    only 3*8, 7*6 and 8*2 % of the population. The relations of the Esths and Letts
                    with their landlords are anything but friendly.</p>
               <p>The governments of St Petersburg (apart from the capital), Olonets and Archangel
                    contain an admixture of Karelians, Samo-yedes and Syryenians, the remainder
                    being Great Russians. In the E. and 5.E. provinces of the Volga
                    (Nizhniy-Novgorod, Simbirsk, Samara, Penza and Saratov.) the Great Russians
                    prevail, the remainder being chiefly Mordvinians, Tatars, Chuvashes and</p>
               <p>Bashkirs, Germans in Samara and Saratov, and Little Russians in the last named.
                    In the Ural governments of Perm and Vyatka Great Russians are in the majority,
                    the remainder being a variety of Finno-Tatars. In the S. Ural governments
                    (Uralsk, Orenburg, Ufa) the admixture of Turko-Tatars—of Kirghiz in Uralsk,
                    Bashkirs in Orenburg and Ufa, and less important races—becomes considerable.</p>
               <p>The state religion is that of the Orthodox Greek Church (Orthodox Catholic or
                    Orthodox Eastern Church). Its head is the tsar; but although he makes and annuls
                    all appointments, he does not determine questions of dogmatic theology. The
                    principal ecclesiastical authority is the Holy Synod, the head of which, the
                    Procurator, is one of the council of ministers and exercises very wide powers in
                    ecclesiasticaI matters. In theory all religions may be freely professed, except
                    that certain restrictions, such as domicile, <note anchored="true"

                    According to returns published in 1905 the adherents of the different religious
                    communities in the whole of the Russian empire numbered approximately as

               <p>The ecclesiastical heads of the national Orthodox Greek Church consist of three
                    metropolitans (St Petersburg, Moscow, Kiev), fourteen archbishops and fifty
                    bishops, all drawn from the ranks of the monastic (celibate) clergy. The
                    parochial clergy are celibate in so far as they must.be married when appointed,
                    but if left widowers may not marry again.</p>
               <p>All Russians, with the exception of a number of White Russians who belong to the
                    United Greek Church (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Roman Catholic Church),</hi>
                    profess the Orthodox Greek faith or belong to one or other of the numberless
                    dissident sects. The Poles and most of the Lithuanians are Roman Catholics. The
                    Esths and all other Western Finns,, the Germans and the Swedes are Protestant.
                    The Tatars, Bashkirs and Kirghiz are Mahommedans; but the last-named have to a
                    great extent maintained along with Mahommedanism their old Shamanism. . The same
                    holds good of the Meshcheryaks, both Moslem and Christian. The Mordvinians are
                    nearly all Orthodox Greek, as also are the Votyaks, Voguls, Cheremisses and
                    Chuvashes, but their religions are, in reality, modifications of Shamanism under
                    the influence.of some Christian and Moslem beliefs. The Moguls, though baptized,
                    are in fact believers in fetishism as much as the unconverted Samoyedes.
                    Finally, the Kalmucks are Lamaite Buddhists.</p>
               <p>In his relations with Moslems, Buddhists and even fetishists the Russian peasant
                    looks rather to conduct than to creed, the latter being in his view simply a
                    matter of nationality. Indeed, towards paganism, at least, he is perhaps even
                    more than tolerant, preferring on the whole to keep on good terms with pagan
                    divinities. The numerous outbreaks against the Jews are directed, not against
                    their creed, but against them as keen business men and extortionate
                    money-lenders. Any idea of proselytism is quite foreign to the ordinary Russian
                    mind, and the outbursts of proselytizing zeal occasionally manifested by the
                    clergy are really due to the desire for “ Russification,” and traceabIe to the
                    influence of the higher clergy and of the government.</p>

               <p>It is this political rather than religious spirit which also underlies the
                    repressive attitude of the government, and of the Orthodox Church as the organ
                    of the government, <hi rend="italic">ktidu.**</hi> towards the various dissident
                    sects <hi rend="italic">(Raskolniki,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">raskol,</hi>
                    schism), which for more than two centuries past have played an important part in
                    the popular life of Russia, and, since the political developments of the end of
                    the 19th and early years of the 20th century, have tended to do so more and
                    more. To understand the problem of the <hi rend="italic">Raskolniki</hi> it is
                    necessary to bear two things in mind: the fundamental principle of Eastern
                    Orthodoxy as distinct from Western Catholicism, and the practical identification
                    in Russia of the National Church with the National State. The very basis of
                    Orthodoxy is that the Church is by Christ’s ordinance unalterable, that its
                    traditional forms, every one of which is a vehicle of saving grace, were
                    established in the beginning by Christ and his apostles, and that consequently
                    nothing may be added or altered. The trouble began early in the 17th century
                    with the attempt, made in connexion with the printing of the liturgical books,
                    to emend certain ritual details in which there was proved to have been a
                    departure from primitive usage; <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial" n="40"> The most important alterations were the repetition
                        twice, instead of three times, of the “ Alleluiah ” at the Eucharist, and
                        the making the sign of the cross with two fingers instead of three. </note>
                    it came to a head under the patriarch Nikon (#.:&gt;.). Under his influence
                    a synod endorsed the changes in 1654; one bishop alone, Paul of Colomna,
                    dissented, and he was deposed, knouted and kept in prison till he died mad. In
                    1656 the synod anathematized the adherents of the old forms, and the anathema
                    was confirmed by those of 1666 and 1667. To the conservatives, known
                    subsequently as Old Ritualists or Old Believers, this marked the beginning of
                    the reign of Antichrist (was not 666 the number of the Beast?); but they
                    continued the struggle, conservative opposition to the Westernizing policy of
                    the tsars, which was held responsible for the introduction of Polish luxury and
                    Latin heresy, giving it a political as well as a religious character. The rising
                    of the Strelitsi in 1682 all but gave them the victory; the crushing of the
                    rising relegated them definitely to the status of schismatics. They were placed
                    in still completer antagonism to the established Orthodox Church by the
                    innovations of Peter the Great. The Muscovite tsars had pursued them with fire
                    and sword. The Russian emperors, having established themselves as heads of the
                    Church and the Holy Synod as a state department, were not likely willingly to
                    tolerate their existence.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Raskol</hi> was threatened with extinction by the gradual
                    dying out of its priests, which led to a further schism within itself, into the
                        <hi rend="italic">Popovshchina</hi> (with priests) and the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Bezpopovsh-china</hi> (without priests). The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Popovsti,</hi> who were served by priests converted from the Orthodox
                    Church, made their headquarters in the island of Werka, in a tributary of the
                    Dnieper, in Poland (1695), and after its destruction by the government in 1735
                    and again in 1764, at Starodubye in the government of Chernigov, whence their
                    doctrine spread in the country of the Don. In 1771 their headquarters were fixed
                    at Moscow, in the Rogoshkiy cemetery assigned to them during the plague; here
                    they had a monastery, seminary and consistory, until they were ejected by the
                    emperor Nicholas I. In 1832 priests were forbidden to join them, and they had to
                    apply to a deposed Bosnian metropolitan, who became their chief bishop,
                    establishing his see in the monastery of Belokrinitsa in Bukovina. In 1862 the
                    synod of the <hi rend="italic">Popovshchina</hi> passed a circular letter making
                    advances to the government with a view to a compromise, which was arranged on
                    the basis of the Old Believers consenting to accept the ministrations of
                    Orthodox priests on condition that they should use the unrevised books. This led
                    to a further schism into three sections: those who recognize the metropolitan
                    and the compromise <hi rend="italic">(Edinovyertsi),</hi> those who recognize
                    the metropolitan but repudiate the compromise, those who repudiate both <hi
                        rend="italic">(Bieglopopovtsi).</hi> There had already been other schisms on
                    such questions as the right way to swing a censer and the legality of
                    self-immolation for the Lord’s sake.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Bezpopovtsi,</hi> known also as <hi rend="italic"
                        >Pomoranye,</hi> because they are mainly found in the sparsely populated
                    country near the White Sea, are in some ways more remarkable. They reject the
                    ministration of priests altogether, since in the time of Antichrist <hi
                        rend="italic">(i.e.</hi> the heretic tsar) the only sacrament that remains
                    is baptism. They therefore elect elders, who expound the Scriptures, baptize and
                    hear confessions. They are, however, in no sense evangelicals in the Western
                    sense; for they observe rigorous fasts, reverence icons, and believe implicitly
                    in the efficacy of the multiplication of crossings, bowings and prostrations.
                    They have, moreover, thrown* off from time to time a number of extravagant
                    offshoots. Such are the <hi rend="italic">Philip povsti,</hi> founded by one
                    Philip (who burned himself alive for Christ’s sake in 1743), who have exalted
                    self-immolation into a principle; the <hi rend="italic">Stranniki</hi>
                    (pilgrims) and <hi rend="italic">Byeguni</hi> (runners), who interpret Matt. x.
                    37 fL literally, and reject legal marriage; the <hi rend="italic">Nyetovsti</hi>
                    (denyers), who deny the necessity for common worship, since there are no
                    priests; the <hi rend="italic">Molchalyniki</hi> (mutes), whom no torture can
                    persuade to utter a word.</p>
               <p>Closely akin to these, though not derived from the Old Believers, are certain
                    mystic sects which deny the efficacy of the sacraments altogether. Of these the
                    most remarkable arc the so-called <hi rend="italic">Khlysti (“
                        flagellants,”</hi> from <hi rend="italic">klyesat, <hi rend="sup">u</hi></hi> to strike, lash,” but possibly a corruption of Khristi, “ Christs ”). They
                    originated in 1645, when, according to their belief, God the Father descended in
                    a chariot of fire on Mount Gorodim, in the province of Vladimir, and took up his
                    abode in a peasant named Daniel Philippov, who chose another peasant, named Ivan
                    Suslov, for his son, the Christ. Suslov selected a “ mother of God ” and twelve
                    apostles. Though twice crucified and once flayed by order of the tsar, he always
                    rose again, and did not die till 1716. Suslov chose a successor in one Prokopiy
                    Lupkin, and since then—in the belief of the sect—every generation, even every
                    community, has had its Christ and its “ mother of God,” who are worshipped by
                    reason of the Divine Spirit dwelling in them. It is the duty of all believers to
                    strive to become one or other of these by subduing the flesh, which is the
                    product of Evil, and all motions of the will. Each community is presided over by
                    an “ angel,” or prophet, and a prophetess, whose word is law. All alike are
                    subject to the twelve commandments issued by the “ Sabaoth,” that is to say
                    Daniel Philippov. These include the prohibition of alcoholic drink, of fleshly
                    sins and of marriage, and the inculcation of faith in the Holy Ghost and
                    complete surrender to his influence. At their prayer-meetings the Khlysti dance
                    to the accompaniment of hymns, the dance gradually developing into a wild
                    dervish-like spinning which is kept up till they drop, foaming at the mouth and
                    prophesying. Perhaps the most remarkable fact about this sect is that it is
                    secret, and that its members ostensibly belong to the Orthodox Church.</p>
               <p>An offshoot of the Khlysti is the more celebrated secret sect of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Skoptsi (skopets,</hi> a eunuch), which represents an extreme
                    ascetic reaction from the promiscuous immorality of some (by no means all) of
                    the Khlysti. Their idea of attaining salvation is self-mutilation according to
                    the counsel of perfection implied in Matt. xix. 12 and xviii. 8, 9. The “ royal
                    seal ” is complete self-castration; partial mutilation is known as the “ second
                    purity.” In the case of women the mutilation usually takes the form of
                    amputation of the breasts. This horrible sect, which was founded by one
                    Selivanov in the last quarter of the 18th century, seems to have a morbid
                    attraction for people of all classes in Russia, and all the efforts of the
                    government have not succeeded in stamping it out (see Skoptsi).</p>
               <p>Closer akin to certain Western forms of dissidence from traditional Catholicism,
                    though of native growth, are the <hi rend="italic">Molo-kani,</hi> so called
                    popularly because they continue to drink milk <hi rend="italic">(moloko)</hi>
                    during fasts. Their origin is unknown, but they are officially mentioned as
                    early as 1765. They style themselves “ truly spiritual Christians,” and in their
                    rejection of the sacraments, their indifference to outward forms, and their
                    insistence on the spiritual interpretation of the Bible (“ the letter killeth
                    ”), they are closely akin to the Quakers, whom they resemble also in their
                    inoffensive mode of life and the practice of mutual help.</p>

               <p>From the Molokani the <hi rend="italic">Dukhoborlsi,</hi> in England better
                    known as Doukhobors (g.®.), are distinguished hy their subordination of the
                    Scriptures to the authority of the “ inner light.” They are dualists, like the
                    Bogomils (g.®.), ascribing the hody to a fall from a state when the soul was on
                    the same plane as God. The Incarnation was no isolated historical occurrence,
                    hut it is repeated over and over again in the faithful, each one of whom is in a
                    certain sense God, by virtue of the indwelling Spirit. Both the Molokani and the
                    Dukhobortsi deny the authority of the civil government as such, and object on
                    principle to military service. The former, however, give little trouble; on the
                    other hand, the government has from time to time proceeded with extreme severity
                    against the Dukhobortsi, whose refusal to serve in the army, if allowed to go
                    unpunished, would have set a contagious example.</p>
               <p>Dissidence of all kinds has made a considerable advance since the
                    emancipation.of the serfs in 1861, the increase—as might be expected in a wholly
                    illiterate population—being greatest in the more extravagant sects. On the other
                    hand, Western Protestantism has also made great headway, notably the Stundists,
                    whose, rationalistie-Protestant teaching has gained a firm foothold especially,
                    in Little Russia, where the <hi rend="italic">Raskol</hi> never penetrated. The
                    Baptists have also made considerable progress, notably among the Molokani. <note

                    population into orders possessed of unequal rights is still maintained. The
                    great mass of the people, 8i*6%, helong to the peasant order, the others being:
                    nobility, i*3%; clergy, 0-9; the burghers and merchants, 9-3; and military, 6*i.
                    Thus more than 88 millions of the Russians are peasants. Half of them were
                    formerly serfs (10,447,149 males in 1858)—the remainder being “ state peasants ”
                    (9,194,891 males in 1858, exclusive of the Archangel government) and “ domain
                    peasants ” (842,740 males the same year).</p>
               <p>The serfdom which had sprung up in Russia in the 16th century, and became
                    consecrated by law in 1609, taking, however, nearly one hundred and fifty years
                    to attain its full growth, was abolished in 1861. This act liberated the serfs
                    from a yoke which was really terrible, even under the best landlords, and from
                    this point of view it was obviously an immense henefit. <note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial" n="42"> It was only as late as 1904,
                        however, that the landed proprietors were forbidden by law to inflict
                        corporal punishment upon the peasants. </note> But it was far from securing
                    corresponding economic results.</p>
               <p>The household servants or dependents attached to the personal service of their
                    masters were merely set free; and they entirely went to reinforce the town
                    proletariat. The peasants proper received their houses and orchards, and
                    allotments of arable land. These allotments were given over to the rural commune
                    (w/r), which was made responsible, as a whole, for the payment of taxes for the
                    allotments. For these allotments the peasants had to pay, as hefore, either by
                    personal labour or by a fixed rent. The allotments could he redeemed by them
                    with the help of the crown, and then they were freed from all obligations to the
                    landlord. The crown paid the landlord in obligations representing the
                    capitalized rent, and the peasants had to pay the crown, for forty-nine years,
                    6% interest on this capital. The redemption was not calculated on the value of
                    the allotments of land, but was considered as a compensation for the loss of the
                    compulsory labour of the serfs; so that throughout Russia, with the exception of
                    a few provinces in the S.E., it was—and still remains, notwithstanding a very
                    great increase in the value of land—much higher than the market value of the
                    allotment. Moreover, many proprietors contrived to curtail seriously the
                    allotments which the peasants had possessed under serfdom, and frequently they
                    deprived them of precisely the parts which they were most in need of, namely,
                    pasture lands around their houses, and forests. The effect of this, craftily
                    calculated beforehand, was to compel the peasants to rent pasture lands from the
                    landlord at any price.</p>
               <p>The present condition of the peasants—according to official documents—appears to
                    be as follows. In the twelve central governments they grow, on the average,
                    sufficient rye-bread for only 200 days in the year—often for only 180 and 100
                    days. One quarter of them have received allotments of only 2-9 acres per male,
                    and one-half less than 8-5 to 11*4 acres—the normal size of the allotment
                    necessary to the subsistence of a family under the three-fields system being
                    estimated at 28 to 42 acres. Land must thus of necessity be rented from the
                    landlords at fabulous prices. The aggregate value of the redemption and land
                    taxes often reaches 185 to 275% of the normal rental value of the allotments,
                    not to speak of taxes for recruiting purposes, the church, roads, local
                    administration and so on, chiefly levied from the peasants. The arrears increase
                    every year; one-fifth of the inhabitants have left their houses; cattle are
                    disappearing. Every year more than half the adult males (in some districts
                    three-fourths of the men and one-third of the women) quit their homes and wander
                    throughout Russia in search of labour. In the governments of the black-earth
                    region the state of matters is hardly better. Many peasants took thegratuitous
                    allotments,” whose amount was about one-eighth of the normal allotments.</p>
               <p>The average allotment in Kherson is only 0*90 acre, and for allotments from 2*9
                    to 5*8 acres the peasants pay 5 to 10 roubles of redemption tax. The state
                    peasants are better off, but still they are emigrating in masses. It is only in
                    the steppe governments that the situation is more hopeful. . In Little Russia,
                    where the allotments were personal (the <hi rend="italic">mir</hi> existing only
                    among state peasants), the state of affairs does not differ for the better, on
                    account of the high redemption taxes. In the W. provinces, where the land was
                    valued cheaper and the allotments somewhat increased after the Polish
                    insurrection, the general situation might be better were it not for the former
                    miseiy of the peasants. Finally, in the Baltic provinces nearly all the iand
                    belongs to the German landlords, who either farm the land themselves, with hired
                    labourers, or let it in small farms. Only one-fourth of the peasants are
                    farmers, the remainder being mere labourers, who are emigrating in great
                    numbers.</p>
               <p>The situation of the former serf-proprietors is also unsatisfactory. Accustomed
                    to the use of compulsory labour, they have failed to accommodate themselves to
                    the new conditions. The millions of roubles of redemption money, received from
                    the crown have been*" spent without any real or lasting agricultural
                    improvements having been affected. The forests have been sold, and only those
                    landlords are prospering who exact rack-rents for the land without which the
                    peasants could not live upon their allotments. During the years 1861 to 1892 the
                    land owned by the nobles decreased 30%, or from 210,000,000 to 150,000,000
                    acres; during the following four years an additional 2,119,500 acres were sold;
                    and since then the sales have gone on at an accelerated rate, until in 1903
                    alone close upon 2,000,000 acres passed out of their hands. On the other hand,
                    since 1861, and more especially since 1882, when the Peasant Land Bank was
                    founded for making advances to peasants who were desirous of purchasing land,
                    the former serfs, or rather their descendants, have between 1883 and 1904 bought
                    about 19,500,000 acres from their former masters. There has been an increase of
                    wealth among the few, but along w'ith this a general impoverishment of the mass
                    of the people, and the peculiar institution of the <hi rend="italic">mir,</hi>
                    framed on the principle of community of ownership and occupation of the land,
                    was not conducive to the growtn of individual effort. In November 1906, however,
                    the emperor Nicholas II. promulgated a provisional <hi rend="italic">ukaz</hi>
                    permitting the peasants to become freeholders of allotments made at the.time of
                    emancipation, all redemption dues being remitted. This measure, which was
                    endorsed by the third Duma in an act passed on the 21st of December 1908, is
                    calculated to have far-reaching and profound effects upon the rural economy of
                    Russia. Thirteen years previously the government had endeavoured to secure
                    greater fixity and permanence of tenure by providing that at least twelve years
                    must elapse between every two redistributions.of the land belonging to a <hi

                    future, as an ideal that could only gradually be realized.</p>
               <p>The co-operative spirit of the Great Russians shows itself in another sphere in

               <p>any impulse from theory, simply as a spontaneous outgrowth of popular life. When
                    workmen from any province come, for instance, to St Petersburg to engage in the
                    textile industries, or to work as carpenters, masons, &amp;c., they
                    immediately unite in groups of ten to fifty persons, settle in a house together,
                    keep a common table and pay each his part of the expense to the elected elder of
                    the artel. All over Russia there is a network of such artels—in the cities, in
                    the forests, on the banks of the rivers, on journeys and even in the prisons.</p>
               <p>The industrial artel is almost, as frequent as the preceding, in all those
                    trades which admit of it. Artels of one or two hundred carpenters, bricklayers,
                    &amp;c., are common wherever new buildings have to be erected, or railways
                    or bridges constructed; the contractors always prefer to deal with an artel,
                    rather than with separate workmen. It is needless to add that the wages divided
                    by the artels are higher than those earned by isolated workmen.</p>
               <p>Finally, a great number of artels on the stock exchange, in the seaports, in the
                    great cities, during the great fairs and on railways have grown up, and have
                    acquired the confidence of tradespeople to such an extent that considerable sums
                    of money and complicated banking operations are frequently handed over to an
                    artelshik (member of an artel) without any receipt, his number or his name being
                    accepted as sufficient guarantee. These artels are recruited only on personal
                    acquaintance with the candidates for membership. Co-operative societies have
                    also been organized by several <hi rend="italic">zemstvos.</hi> They have
                    achieved good results, but do not exhibit, on the whole, the same unity of
                    organization as those which have arisen in a natural way among the peasants and
                    artisans.</p>
               <p>The chief occupation of approximately seven-eighths of the population of
                    European Russia is agriculture, but its character varies considerably according
                    to the soil, the climate and the geographical position of the different regions.
                    A sinuous line, drawn from Zhitomir via Kiev, Tula and</p>
               <p>Kazan to Ufa—that is, from W.S.W. to E.N.E.—separates the “ northern soils ”
                    from the “ southern soils.” To the S. of this line, as far as the sandy deserts
                    of Astrakhan and the steppes of N. Caucasia, lies the “ black earth ” region.
                    Broadly speaking, the forests here yield to steppes, and the soil is very
                    fertile; but the whole region suffers periodically from drought. The " northern
                    soils,” which are glacial deposits more or less redistributed by water, are much
                    less fertile as a rule, and consist of all possible varieties from a tough
                    boulder clay, to loose sand. Both N. and S. of this line it is customary to
                    distinguish several zones, lying, generally, parallel to it, and differentiated
                    chiefly by climatic differences. In the tundras of the extreme N. agriculture
                    does not exist; the reindeer constitutes the principal wealth of the nomad
                    Samoyedes and Lapps. In the forest region S. of the tundras, which extends over
                    an area of more than 500,000 sq. m., agriculture is carried on with great
                    difficulty, not only because of the infertility of the soil, but also because of
                    the severity of the climate and the fact that there are only three to four
                    months in the year during which agriculture can be carried on. Apart from
                    hunting and fishing, the exploitation of the forests provides the principal
                    occupation of the inhabitants. Crops, chiefly barley, rye, oats, turnips and
                    green crops, are, however, grown on clearings in the forest, though the yield is
                    poor. S. of 60 <hi rend="sup">0</hi> N. agriculture becomes the predominant
                    industry, while the exploitation of the forests plays only a secondary part. In
                    this zone, which extends over an area of nearly 600,000 sq. m., and on the S.
                    touches the agrarian line already mentioned, the principal crops are rye and
                    oats, with barley and wheat coming next, though flax and green crops are also
                    grown. Cattle have to be housed for the winter. In the W. of this zone, that is
                    in the Baltic provinces, the climate is less severe as well as moisten
                    Agriculture is carried on in a more intelligent manner, and the yield is higher.
                    Flax is almost of as much importance as wheat, and the potato is more cultivated
                    than in any other part of Russia. Hardy fruit thrives, and live-stock breeding
                    prospers. In the W. governments of Kovno, Vitebsk, Vilna, Mogilev, Minsk and
                    Grodno the climate is more temperate, but agriculture is more backward than in
                    the Baltic provinces. The three-field system of cropping a patch of land until
                    its fertility is exhausted, and then allowing it to revert to the primeval
                    condition, is still pursued, and both landowners and peasantry suffer from want
                    of capital and lack of agricultural training. Flax is one of the principal
                    exports, of this region, timber being another.</p>
               <p>In middle Russia the winters are both longer ana harder, and agriculture is
                    consequently carried on under greater difficulties. One of the most serious of
                    these is caused not by the unfavourable character of. the climate but by the
                    shortness of labour. Since their emancipation in 1861, the peasants of the
                    central governments of Russia have in large numbers drifted away into’the black
                    earth zone, or have gone to the factories. The methods of agriculture are still
                    unscientific and unprogressive. Rye is the staple crop, though buckwheat, flax,
                    green crops and the potato are cultivated in considerable quantities.</p>
               <p>Agriculture 19 most advanced in the W. of the black earth zone, that is in the
                    governments of Kiev, Podolia, Poltava and in part of Kharkov. The winters are
                    less severe, and modern agricultural machinery is generally employed, at all
                    events on the larger estates.</p>
               <p>In consequence of these more favourable conditions there is greater variety in
                    the cropping; a good deal of wheat is grown, as well as beetroot for sugar,
                    fibre plants and oleaginous plants, fruit, and even (W. of the Dnieper) the
                    vine. Live-stock breeding is likewise in a more prosperous condition. The rest
                    of the black earth zone, which stretches from these governments N.E. to the
                    Volga, is less favoured by nature; the winters are longer and more inclement,
                    and droughts are not uncommon. When this happens there is great suffering from
                    famine, for wheat is the crop upon which the people principally depend, though
                    rye, buckwheat and oats are also cultivated. But a long course of continuous
                    cropping with these grain crops, without affording compensation to the soil in
                    the form of manure or deep cultivation, has so exhausted it that its
                    productiveness has sadly deteriorated. The consequence is that the peasantry are
                    constantly in a state bordering on destitution, and exposed to the horrors of
                    famine, like those which visited them in 1890 and 1898, and threatened in 1907.</p>
               <p>S. of the above zone come the S. steppes. In the W., in Bessarabia, the three
                    chief products are maize, wine and hardy fruit, especially plums. Here the
                    climate is temperate and fairly moist, but farther E. it is distinctly more
                    arid. Wheat is the principal crop, with barley second. Water-melons, sun-flowers
                    and flax, both the last two for oil, are usual crops. . But the breeding of
                    horses and sheep is of equal importance with agriculture. Here again both
                    capital and labour are short, and the cultivation of the soil suffers from the
                    fact that, owing to the absence of timber, dry dung is used for fuel instead of
                    being employed as manure. The steppe conditions extend over the greater part of
                    the Crimea and up to the foothills of the Caucasus.. The actual distribution of
                    arable land, forests and meadows, in European Russia and Poland is shown in the

               <p>Down to January ist 1903, the peasants had actually redeemed out of the land
                    allotted to them in 1861 a total of 280,530,516 acres. In Poland the peasants as
                    a body have, in addition to the land thus assigned to them by the government,
                    bought some 2 ½ million acres since 1863, and of this quantity they purchased no
                    less than 1,600,000 acres, or 64% of the whole, between 1893 and 1905.</p>
               <p>Taking the whole of European Russia and Poland, almost exactly two-thirds of the
                    total area is sown every year with cereals. But generally in from 18 to 33 out
                    of the 72 governments in European Russia (including Caucasia) and Poland the
                    yield of cereals is not sufficient for the wants of the people. In 30 to 40
                    governments, however, there is in most years a surplus available for export. Out
                    of the total acreage under cereals 34% is generally sown with rye, 26% with
                    wheat, 20% with oats and 10 ½% with barley. Beetroot (6-8 million tons annually)
                    for sugar is especially cultivated in Poland, the governments of Kiev, Podolia,
                    Volhynia, Kharkov, Bessarabia and Kherson. About 100,000 tons of tobacco are
                    grown annually in the S. Flax and hemp occupy considerable acreages in central
                    and N.W. Russia. The vine is cultivated as far N. as 49° N. (in
                    Bessarabia,.Crimea,.Don Cossacks territory and Caucasia), the annual production
                    of wine amounting to 35-50 million gallons, three-fifths in Caucasia.

                    31 in 1851 to 23 in 1882 and 27 in 1904.; sheep, from 56 to 46 and 41 in the
                    years named respectively; and pigs, from 13 to 9 and 10 respectively. Recent
                    investigations in the government of Moscow have revealed that 40% of the peasant
                    households possessed no horses, and similar inquiries in 41 governments elicited
                    the fact that 28% of the peasant households were without horses, although of the
                    total number of horses in the country ,82% belong to the peasantry. The animal
                    commonly met with is small and possessed of very little strength; the best are
                    those of Poland, the W. governments and the S. steppe country. Both the horses
                    of the Cossacks and the <hi rend="italic">bityug</hi> race of S. Russia are fine
                    animals, and those of the Kirghiz, though not big, are famous for their
                    endurance. Finland ponies are exported in large numbers. The best bred races of
                    cattle are those of Poland, the W. provinces, Little Russia and the far N.
                    (Kholmogory). Of the 55 million sheep kept in Russia only about 15 <hi
                        rend="sub">t</hi> millions belong to the fine merino breed, and, these are
                    pastured chiefly on the Black Sea steppes. Modern dairy-farming is only just
                    beginning in Russia, but butter is being exported in increasing quantities to W.
                    Europe, including Great Britain. Poultryfarming is being more extensively
                    engaged in, and vast numbers of eggs are exported.</p>
               <p>Agriculture stands at a low level in Russia. The landowners are often poor, and
                    suffer from want of capital and lack of enterprise. The peasantry are
                    impoverished, and in many parts live on the verge of starvation for the greater
                    part of the year. , While the methods of agriculture, have generally shown
                    little, if any, advance, the population is increasing rapidly; and although
                    since the emancipation of the peasants the average annual export of cereals has
                    increased from less than 1 ½ million tons in i860 to over 6 million tons in
                    1900, this result has been attained largely by the repeated cropping to
                    exhaustion of the soil. Thus the cultivators, whether noble or peasant, have not
                    profited much from the change in their economic circumstances brought about by
                    the social emancipation of 1861. Agriculture suffers from the widespread poverty
                    of the agricultural classes, from the taxation which weighs unjustly upon the
                    peasantry,, from, their lack of education, their technical ignorance and
                    national indoIence, and from the absence of those progressive institutions (e.g.
                    co-operative buying) by means of which the peasantry, of Denmark have so
                    wonderfully improved their position. As illustrating the general impoverishment
                    of the Russian peasantry, it may be stated that the arrears of taxation owed by
                    them have increased enormously since 1882, when they amounted to £2,854,000,
                    until in 1900 the total amount was put at £15,222,000. And, strange to say, the
                    heaviest arrears are due from the fertile black earth region of S. Russia,
                    namely, 80% of their total indebtedness. Within recent years, however, some
                    efforts have been made both by the Ministry of Agriculture and by the more
                    enlightened of the <hi rend="italic">zemstvos</hi> to improve the education of
                    the peasantry, but the progress achieved has been small. The methods adopted by
                    the <hi rend="italic">zemstvos</hi> for improving the condition of agriculture
                    have included the formation of agricultural councils, the appointment of
                    inspectors, and the founding of museums, meteorological stations and depots for
                    the sale of agricultural machinery. Measures are, being taken by the <hi
                        rend="italic">zemstvos</hi> to increase the very low productivity of the
                    forests. These cover a considerable area, as may be seen by the following table

               <p>The distribution of forests is very unequal, the area covered by them in the
                    various governments varying from 70% of the total area in the Ural governments
                    of Perm and Ufa, and 68% in Olonets and Archangel, down to 2% in the S.E. The
                    state is the chief owner of forests (almost exclusive owner in Archangel), and
                    owns no less than 289,226,000 acres in European Russia and Poland (235,000,000
                    acres of good forests), while private persons own 171,800,000 acres, the peasant
                    communities 67,250,000 and the imperial family 22,400,000 acres.</p>
               <p>Sericulture, which was in a flourishing condition in the ’sixties both in
                    Caucasia and in S. Russia, was reduced to a very low ebb, in consequence of the
                    silkworm disease, and was only renewed with any vigour towards the end of the
                    ’eighties. At the beginning of</p>
               <p>the 20th century it was most developed in Transcaucasia (Kutais, Elisavetpol),
                    and extended into N. Caucasia. Sericulture is taught in a number of special
                    schools and in a great number of village schools. Attempts are being made to
                    re-establish the silkworm industry in S. Russia and in Poland. Altogether raw
                    silk and silk yarn to an annual value exceeding 1 ½ millions sterling are
                    exported from Russia.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the wealth of the country in minerals and metals of all kinds,
                    and, the endeavours made by government to encourage mining, including the
                    imposition of protective tariffs even against Finland (in 1885), this and the
                    related industries are still at a low stage of development. The remoteness of
                    the mining from the industrial centres, the want of technical instruction and of
                    capital, and the existence of vexatious regulations, aggravated by the disturbed
                    condition of the country, which hinder credit, confidence and enterprise, are
                    amongst the chief reasons for this. The imports of foreign metals in the rough,
                    and of coal are steadily increasing, while the exports, never otherwise than
                    insignificant, show no advance. As a producer of iron Russia nevertheless runs
                    France neck and neck for the fourth place amongst the iron producing countries
                    of the world, her annual output having increased from 1,004,800 metric tons in
                    1891 to 2,808,000 in 1901 and to 2,900,000 in 1904. The two principal mining
                    centres of European Russia are the Urals, Ekater-lnoslav, Kharkov and the Don
                    Cossacks territory. The Ural industry is the older, and is still conducted on
                    primitive methods, wood being largely used for fuel, and the ore and metals
                    being transported by water down the Kama and other rivers. , The minerals
                    chiefly produced in the Urals are iron, coal, gold, platinum, copper, salt and
                    precious stones. The production of pig-iron nearly doubled between 1890 and,
                    1900, increasing from 446,800 tons in the former year to 801,600 in the latter;
                    but since 1900 the output has declined, the total for 1904 (inclusive of
                    Siberia) being 644,000 tons. The amount of iron and steel produced in the Urals
                    is not quite 20% of the total in all European Russia and Poland. The output of
                    coal in the Urals is, altogether, less than 3 % of the total for all the empire
                    and 4% of the output of European Russia (exclusive of Poland) alone. The annual
                    increase is but small, 261,300 tons having been the total in 1891, and 517,000
                    tons the total in 1904. Gold has been mined in the Urals since 1820; but since
                    1892 the output has fallen off very considerably. Whereas in the latter year the
                    yield amounted to 395.500 oz., in 1900 it was only 291,250 oz. No less than 96%
                    of the world’s supply of platinum comes from the Urals; but the total output
                    only ranges between 10,000 and 16,000 lb annually. The copper industry has
                    greatly declined since the 18th century; whereas then it kept 20 smelting works
                    employed, now one-tenth of that number can hardly be kept going. The output for
                    the year is less than 4000 tons. At one time all Russia was supplied with salt
                    from the Urals, but at the present time the output is extremely small, less than
                    350 tons annually. Salt has been mined there since the 16th century.</p>
               <p>The mining region of S. Russia is much more important. It is of comparatively
                    recent foundation (i860), and is carried on largely with French and Belgian
                    capital, with modern appliances and with modern scientific knowledge. Out of an
                    average of some 2,700,000 tons, of pig-iron produced annually in the whole of
                    the Russian empire, 61*5 % is produced in the basin of the Donets, and out of an
                    average of 2,160,500 tons of worked iron and steel 48*7 % are prepared in the
                    same region. The principal consumer of this iron and steel is the government,
                    for its railways, locomotives, w'agons, arsenals, artillery, &amp;c. The
                    output of coal in the Russian empire has increased from a total of less than
                    300,000 tons in i860 to 3,280,000 in 1880, 15,878,200 in 1900, and 18,620,000
                    tons in 1904. Of these totals something like 70% is produced in the S.
                    coal-nela. Coal takes, however, an altogether secondary’ place as a fuel in
                    Russia ; wood is much more extensively used, not only for domestic, but also for
                    industrial purposes. It is estimated that for domestic purposes nearly
                    150,000,000 tons of w’ood are consumed every year, while the steamships,
                    railways and factories consume another 20 or 25 million tons. At the same time
                    large quantities of petroleum refuse are used as fuel in the railways of S.E.
                    Russia and Caucasia, and on the steamboats of the Volga system. For the
                    petroleum industry and the mining of the Caucasus region, see <hi

               <p>Since the time of Peter the Great, the Russian government has been unceasing in
                    its efforts for the creation and development of home manufactures., Important
                    monopolies in the 18th century, and prohibitive import duties, as well as large
                    money bounties, in the 19th contributed towards the accumulation of immense
                    private fortunes, but manufactures have on the whole developed but slowly. A
                    great upward movement has, however, been observable since 1863. About that time
                    a thorough reform of the machinery in use was effected whereby the number of
                    hands employed was reduced, but the yearly production doubled or trebled.
                    Manufacturing industry in the modern sense can hardly be said to have existed in
                    Russia</p>

               <p>before the 19th century, that is to say, industries carried on with capital and
                    machinery in large factories, lndustry of this character was first established
                    in Poland in 1820, and it has grown there rapidly, though never so rapidly as
                    during the last few years of the 19th century. The principal centre is Lodz in
                    the government of Piotrkow, the staple industry being cottons. A good many
                    factories have sprung up also in Warsaw and at Sosnowice and Bcndzin in the
                    extreme S.W. corner of Poland. Besides cottons the products include woollens and
                    cloth, silks, chemicals, machinery, ironware, beer and flour. At Lodz alone the
                    workmen, in great part Germans and Jews, number between 50,000 and 60,000, and
                    the total output of the factories is estimated at £9,000,000 to £10,500,000
                    annually. Similar industries, carried on by similar methods, exist at St
                    Petersburg, Riga, Narva and Odessa. In S. Russia, more particularly at
                    Ekaterinoslav, a very vigorous metallurgical industry has grown up since i860 in
                    conjunction with the iron and coal mining.</p>
               <p>The peculiar feature of Russian industry is the development out of the domestic
                    petty handicrafts of central Russia of. a semifactory on a large scale. Owing to
                    the forced abstention from agricultural labour in the winter months the peasants
                    of central Russia, more especially those of the governments of Moscow, Vladimir,
                    Yaroslavl, Kostroma, Tver, Smolensk and Ryazan have for centuries carried on a
                    variety of domestic handicrafts during the period of compulsory leisure. The
                    usual practice was for the whole of the people in one village to devote
                    themselves to one special occupation. Thus, while one village would produce
                    nothing but felt shoes, another would carve sacred images <hi rend="italic"
                        >(fkons),</hi> and a third spin flax only, a fourth make wooden spoons, a
                    fifth nails, a sixth iron chains, and so on. In the same way certain governments
                    become famous for certain commodities, as Moscow for osier baskets, flower
                    baskets, wicker furniture and lace; Kostroma for lace, wooden utensils, toys,
                    wooden spoons, cups and bowls, bast sacks and mats, bast boots and garden
                    products; Yaroslavl for furniture, brass samovars, saucepans, spurs, rings,
                    &amp;c.; Vladimir for furniture, osier baskets and flower-stands and
                    sickles; Nizhniy-Novgorod for bast mats and sacks, knives, forks and scissors;
                    Tver for lace, nails, sieves, anchors, fish-hooks, locks, coarse clay pottery,
                    saddlery and harness, boots and shoes, and so on. Out of these have grown large
                    factories, employing as many as 10,000 to 12,000 men each; but when harvest
                    comes round,. these men leave the factories and repair to their fields, and
                    meantime the factories stand still for two or three months. Nor do the people
                    work on the holidays of the church, the number of days they lose in this way
                    amounting to nearly one-third of the whole year. Hence, although wages are
                    painfully low, the cost of production to the manufacturer is relatively high ;
                    and it is still further increased by the cost of the raw materials, by the heavy
                    rates of transport owing to the distance from the sea, by the dearness of
                    capital and by the scarcity of fuel. As a consequence this central Russian
                    industry, even when supported by very high protective duties, is only able to
                    produce for the home market and the markets of the adjacent territories in Asia
                    which are under Russian political control. Here again cotton is the principal
                    product; and the remarkable growth of the industry is illustrated by the fact
                    that, whereas in 1843 there were only 350,000 spindles at work, fifty years
                    later there were 4,332,000 so employed, and in 1900, 6,554, boo. The number of
                    looms increased from 87,190 in 1890 to 154,600 in 1900. Next after cottons come
                    woollens, silk, cloth, chemicals, machinery, paper, furniture, hats, cement,
                    leather, glass and china and other products. From the governments of Vyatka and
                    Vladimir large numbers of bricklayers, carpenters and other handicraftsmen
                    migrate temporarily to the S. governments every year, and similarly plasterers
                    and painters from the government of Moscow.</p>

                    compares the number of workers for 1887, 1897 and 1902, of all factories
                    throughout the empire of which the annual production was valued at more than

               <p>With regard to Russian industry generally, the extravagant prices which have to
                    be paid for iron and all iron goods, owing to the prohibitive tariffs, combined
                    with the obstacles put in the way of education, hamper the development of all
                    industries. The cotton factories excel chiefly in the production of red and
                    printed</p>
               <p>cottons. In the flax-mills the tendency is to produce the finest tissues as well
                    as the coarser. The silk-mills employ silk obtained from the Caucasus, Italy and
                    France. The growth of the sugar · industry is shown by the fact that in 1888-93
                    the average annual production of sugar was 444,520 tons, in 1902-3 it was
                    1,180,293 tons. Since 1894 the government has had a monopoly in retailing
                    spirituous liquors, but not wine or beer; but distilling, a very widespread
                    industry, is left in private hands. Beer is chiefly brewed in Poland and the
                    Baltic provinces. Tanneries exist in nearly every government, but it is
                    especially at Warsaw and St Petersburg, and after these at Moscow, that the
                    largest and best modern tanneries and shoe and glove factories are established.
                    The governments of Orel (shoe factories), Kherson, Vyatka, Nizhnîy-Novçorod,
                    Perm, Kiev and Kazan rank next in this respect. Furniture factories are
                    developing greatly, as is the paper industry. Flour-mills play an important part
                    in the general industry of Russia, and there are several tobacco and hemp
                    factories.</p>
               <p>Far from being, destroyed by the competition of the “ modern ” factories,
                    domestic industries have well maintained their ground, new branches of petty
                    trade having, sprung up in some districts, among them the manufacture of
                    agricultural machinery (thrashing machines in Ryazan, Vyatka and Perm; ploughs
                    in Smolensk, &amp;c.) deserves notice.</p>
               <p>The wealth of Russia consisting mainly of raw produce, the trade of the country
                    turns chiefly on the purchase of this for export, and on the sale of
                    manufactured and imported goods in exchange. This traffic is in the hands of a
                    great number of middlemen,—in the W. Jew's, and elsewhere Russians,-—to whom the
                    peasants are.for the most part in debt, as they purchase in advance on security
                    of subsequent payments in corn, tar, wooden wares, &amp;c. A good deal of
                    the internal trade is carried on by travelling merchants.</p>
               <p>The fairs are very numerous. Those of. Nizhniy-Novgorod, with a return of 20
                    millions sterling, of Irbit and Kharkov, of Menzelinsk in Ufa, and Omsk and
                    Ishim in Siberia, have considerable importance both for trade and for home
                    manufactures. Altogether, no fewer than 16,600 fairs are held in Russia, 85% of
                    them in European Russia. Of these, 30 show returns of goods imported to the
                    value of over £100,000 each, 41 from £50,000 to £100,000, and 437 from £10,000
                    to £50,000 each.</p>

               <p>The exports rank in the following order:—cereals (wheat, barley, rye, oats,
                    maize, buckwheat) and flour, 49*2%; timber and wooden wares, 7-2; petroleum,

                    vegetables and fruit, and tobacco. The two best customers of Russia are Germany,
                    which takes 23-3% of her total exports, and the United Kingdom, which takes
                    22*9%. Then follow the Netherlands (9*8%), France, Italy, Finland, Belgium,
                    Austria-Hungary, Denmark, Turkey and Sweden. The commodities which the United
                    Kingdom principally takes are wheat, wool, barley, eggs, oats and flax. With
                    regard to the imports into Russia—they consist mainly of raw materials and
                    machinery for the manufactures, and of provisions, the principal items being raw
                    cotton, 17% of the aggregate; machinery and metal goods, 13%; tea, 5%; mineral
                    ores, 5%; gums and resins, 4%; wool and woollen yarns, 3|%; textiles, 3%; fish,

                    coffee, tobacco and rice. The countries from which Russia buys most extensively
                    are Germany (34%), the United Kingdom (15 ½) and the United States (9I).
                    Machinery, coal, iron, woollens, ships, lead and copper are the commodities
                    supplied by the United Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The total mercantile marine of Russia does, not aggregate 700,000. tons; and .it
                    is distributed in the following proportions: 35*4% in the Caspian Sea, 34.7% in
                    the Black Sea and Sea of Azov. 24-7% in the Baltic Sea and 5-2% in the White
                    Sea. And these proportions represent fairly well the tonnages entering and
                    clearing at the ports of these respective seas. But of the vessels that visit
                    the Russian ports in the way of trade every year only 8-3% are Russian, the rest
                    being of course foreign. Russian craft play, however, a much more important part
                    on the internal, waterways, the traffic on which increases rapidly, <hi

                    over 66% in the ten years. During the same period the tonnage of the craft
                    themselves more than doubled, while the</p>

                    approximately 150,000.</p>
               <p>In i860 Russia possessed less than 1000 m. of railways; by 1885 this had
                    increased to 16,155 19., and by the middle of 1905 there were open for traffic
                    over 40,500 m. of railway, of which 34,150 m. or 84*3 % were in European Russia
                    and nearly</p>
               <p>6400 m. (15*7 %) in Asiatic Russia. Between 1895 and 1905 the building of
                    railways proceeded at a rapid rate, the total length nearly doubling within the
                    ten years, namely, from 22,600 to 40,500 m. The European railways cost on an
                    average £10,465 per mile to construct, and the Asiatic railways £5092 per mile.</p>
               <p>A considerable number of new railways, some of great strategic as well as
                    commercial importance, were built during the last twenty years of the 19th
                    century. At the same time the chief lines of railway which had been built by
                    public companies with a state guarantee, and which represented a loss to the
                    empire of £3,171,250 per annum, as well as a growing indebtedness, were bought
                    by the state. On the whole, the state derives profit from its railways, although
                    several of the later lines, while imperative for state purposes, must
                    necessarily yield but a very small revenue, or be worked at a loss. The most
                    important of the new railways is the Siberian, of which the first section,
                    Chelyabinsk to Omsk, was opened in December 1895, and which, except for a short
                    section round Lake Baikal, in 1901 was completed right through to Stryetensk, on
                    the Shilka, the head of navigation on the Shilka and the Amur, 2710 m. from
                    Chelyabinsk and 4076 miles from Moscow, via Samara and Chelyabinsk. The section
                    round the S. end of Lake Baikal was completed in 1905. At the Pacific end of the
                    Siberian railway a line connecting Vladivostok with Khabarovsk (479 m.) at the
                    junction of the Amur and the Usuri, was first of all built, following the valley
                    of the Usuri. But it was soon found that the cost of the section^required to
                    complete the railway between Stryetensk and Khabarovsk, along the Shilka (246
                    m.) and the Amur (1160 m.), would be enormous, while neither the wild
                    mountainous tracts of the lower Shilka and upper Amur, nor the marshy, often
                    inundated region between Khabarovsk and the Little Khingan mountains, could ever
                    be the seat of a numerous population. Consequently a company was formed by the
                    Russian government in 1896 to construct, with the consent of the Chinese
                    government, a railway from Vladivostok across Manchuria to Karymskaya near Chita
                    in Transbaikalia. This runs for 222 m. on Russian territory and for 1080 m. on
                    Manchurian territory, and from Kharbin sends off a branch to Dalny near Port
                    Arthur on the Liao-tung peninsula. The first portion of the Manchurian railway,
                    built by Russian engineers, with Chinese labour, was finished in 1902. At . the
                    same time several secondary lines were built in connexion with the Siberian
                    line. Chelyabinsk was linked by a transverse line with the middle Urals railway,
                    which connects Perm, the head of navigation in the Volga basin, with Tyumen, the
                    head of navigation on the Ob and Irtysh, passing through Ekaterinburg and other
                    mining centres of the middle Urals. Tomsk is now connected with the main line by
                    a short side branch. A railway has also been built to connect Perm with Kotlas,
                    near the confluence of the Sukhona with the .Yug, at the head of the N. Dvina.
                    This N. portion of the Russian railway system was further completed by the
                    opening in 1906 of a line from St Petersburg via Vologda to Vyatka, intersecting
                    the Moscow-Arthangel line at Vologda.</p>
               <p>Another line of great strategic importance was built across the Transcaspian
                    territory to Ferghana. Starting from Krasnovodsk, it runs S.E. to Merv (560 m.),
                    with a branch line (194 m.) to Kushk, near Herat, then N.E. across the desert to
                    Charjui, on the Amur river, Bokhara and the Russian fort Katta-kurgan, and then
                    to Samarkand, Kokand and Andijan in Ferghana, 710 m. from Merv, with a branch to
                    Tashkent (220 m.). This railway has become important for the export of raw
                    cotton from Central Asia to Russia. In 1905 a second totally independent line
                    was opened from Tashkent | down the Syr-darya to Kazalinsk, and thence to
                    Orenburg.</p>
               <p>A third line of great importance is the junction line between the Transcaucasian
                    railway—which runs from Batum and Poti to, Baku, via Tiflis, with a branch line
                    to Kars—and the railway system of Russia proper. This junction has been effected
                    not across the main Caucasus range, but at its E. extremity, that is, via the
                    Caspian ports of Baku and Petrovsk, which are connected with Vladikavkaz (Beslan
                    junction). The Black Sea j)ort of Novorossiysk, in W. Caucasia, having been
                    connected with the Rostov-Vladikavkaz line, has consequently also been brought
                    into touch with the Russian railways. The Volga is reached from central Russia
                    by seven lines of railways, including one to Kazan, and three main lines radiate
                    from the Volga E. (one to Siberia and two to the Ural river), while the upper
                    Volga (Yaroslavl) is connected with Archangel by a line 523 m. long. A zone
                    tariff was introduced on the Russian railways in 1894, and the cost of long
                    journeys was considerably reduced; a journey of 623 m. can be made third class
                    at a cost of only about 17 shillings, while for less than twice as much 1990 m.
                    can be covered.</p>
               <p>Fish form an important article of national food. The numerous fasts of the
                    national church prescribe a fish diet on many days in the year, and the
                    continuous frost of winter is favourable to the transportation of fish for great
                    distances. Along the</p>
               <p>Murman coast of the Arctic Ocean and in the White Sea, where many millions of
                    herrings are caught annually by some 3000 persons, the yearly producers
                    estimated at the value of £140,000. In the Baltic Sea, as well as in the lakes
                    of its basin (Ladoga, Onega, llmefi, &amp;e.), the yearly value is estimated
                    at £200,000. Of anchovies alone, 10,000,000 jars are prepared annually, while
                    salted fish is, next after bread, the staple food of large masses of the
                    population. The Black Sea fisheries, in which about 4000 men are engaged, yield
                    fish valued at £300,000 per annum. The value of the fish has much increased
                    owing to the introduction of cold storage; as a result of the employment of this
                    method of packing, fish is now exported in a fresh state from the Black Sea to
                    all parts of S.W. Russia, and even to Moscow. The annual yield of the Azov Sea
                    fisheries, occupying 15,000 men, is valued at £600,000. In the Volga section of
                    the Caspian Sea fish arc caught to the value of about £1,000,000 annually ; in
                    the Ural section over 40,000 tons of fish and nearly 1500 tons of caviare are
                    obtained. The total value of the Caspian fisheries is estimated at £3,000,000
                    per annum. Taking the Lake Aral and Siberian, river fisheries into account, it
                    is estimated that altogether the fishing industries yield a revenue to the state
                    of £330,000 annually. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                       <p>The history of Russia may be conveniently divided into four consecutive
                            periods: (1) the period of Independent Principalities; (2) the Mongol
                            Domination; (3) the Tsardom of Muscovy; and (4) the Modem Empire.</p>

                            The first period, like the early history of many other countries, begins
                            with a legend. Nestor, an old monkish chronicler of Kiev, relates that
                            in the middle of the 9th century the Slav and Finnish tribes inhabiting
                            the forest region around Lake Ilmen, between Lake Ladoga and the upper
                            waters of the Dnieper, paid tribute to military adventurers from the
                            land of Rüs, which is commonly supposed to have been a part of Sweden.
                            In the year 859 these tribes expelled the Northmen, but finding that
                            they quarrelled among themselves, they invited them, three years later,
                            to return. Our land, said the deputation sent to Rüs for this purpose,
                            is great and fertile, but there is no order in it; come and reign and
                            rule over us. Three brothers, princes of Rüs, called respectively Rurik,
                            Sineus and Truvor, accepted the invitation and founded a dynasty, from
                            which many of the Russian princes of the present day claim descent.</p>
                       <p>Who were those warlike men of Rus who are universally recognized as the
                            founders of the Russian Empire? This question has given rise to an
                            enormous amount of discussion among learned men, and some of the
                            disputants have not yet laid down their arms; but for impartial
                            outsiders who have carefully studied the evidence there can be little
                            doubt that</p>

                   <p>the men of Rfis, or Variags, as they were sometimes called, were simply the
                        hardy Norsemen or Normans who at that time, in various countries of Europe,
                        appeared first as armed marauders and then lived in the invaded territory as
                        a dominant military caste until they were gradually absorbed by the native
                        population. Lake Ilmen and the river Volkhov, on which stands Novgorod,
                        Rurik’s capital, formed part of the great waterway from the Baltic to the
                        Black Sea, and we know that by this route travelled from Scandinavia to
                        Constantinople the tall fair-haired Northmen who composed the famous
                        Varangian bodyguard of the Byzantine emperors.</p>
                   <p>The new rulers did not long confine their attention to the tribes who had
                        invited them. They at once began to conquer the surrounding country in all
                        directions, and before two centuries had passed they had established
                        themselves firmly at Kiev on the Dnieper, invaded Byzantine territory,
                        threatened Constantinople with a fleet of small craft, obtained as consort
                        for one of their princes, Vladimir I, (?.v.), a sister of the</p>
                   <p>Byzantine emperor on condition of the prince becoming a Christian, adopted
                        Christianity for themselves and their subjects, learned to hold in check the
                        nomadic hordes of the steppe, and formed matrimonial alliances with the
                        reigning families of Poland, Hungary, Norway and France. In short, they
                        became a considerable power in eastern Europe, and might be regarded as one
                        of the claimants for the inheritance of the decrepit East Roman Empire.
                        Unfortunately for the political future of this new state, its internal
                        consolidation did not keep pace with its territorial expansion. In theory
                        the whole Russian land was a gigantic family estate belonging to the Rurik
                        dynasty, and each member of that great family considered himself entitled to
                        a share of it. It had to be divided, therefore, into a number of independent
                        principalities, but it continued to be loosely held together by the dynastic
                        sentiment of the descendants of Rurik and by the patriarchal authority—a
                        sort of <hi rend="italic">patria potestas</hi> —of the senior member of the
                        family, called the grand-prince, who ruled in Kiev, “ the mother of Russian
                        cities?’ His administrative authority was confined to his own principality,
                        but when territorial disputes arose between two or more of his relations,
                        his paternal influence was exercised in the interests of peace and justice.
                        What added to the practical difficulties of this arrangement was that the
                        post of grand-prince was not an hereditary dignity in the sense of
                        descending from father to son, but was always to be held by the senior
                        member of the dynasty; and in the subordinate principalities the same
                        principle of succession was applied, so that reigning princes had to be
                        frequently shifted about from one district to another, according as they
                        could establish the strongest claim to vacant principalities. What
                        constituted in this primitive system of inheritance the strength of a claim
                        was often not easily determined, and even when the legal question was clear
                        enough the law was not always respected by the contending parties. Hence
                        family quarrels became very frequent. These princes were, in fact, men of
                        like passions with ourselves, and acted as powerful men generally do in a
                        rude state of society. Instead of conforming to abstract principles of
                        public law and hereditary succession, they strove to enlarge their
                        territories at the expense of their rivals, and to leave them at their death
                        to their sons rather than to their brothers, nephews and more distant
                        relations. In these circumstances, the traditional authority of the
                        grand-prince, never very great, rapidly declined, and the complicated law of
                        succession, never scrupulously respected, was gradually replaced by “ the
                        good old rule, the simple plan, that he should take who has the power, and
                        he should keep who can.” Yaroslav, sumamed the Great, a man of commanding
                        personlity, was the last grand-prince who upheld vigorously the old system.
                        After his death in 1054 the process of disintegration went on apace and the
                        family feuds multipHed at an alarming rate. During the next 170 years
                        (1054-1224) no less than 64 principalities bad a more or less ephemeral
                        existence, 293 princes put forward succession-claims, and their disputes led
                        to 83 civil wars.</p>
                   <p>During these interminable struggles of rival princes, Kiev, which had been
                        so long the residence of the grand-prince and of the metropolitan, was
                        repeatedly taken by storm and ruthlessly pillaged, and finally the* whole
                        valley of the Dnieper feU a prey to the marauding tribes of the steppe.
                        Thereupon Russian colonization and political influence retreated northwards,
                        and from that time the continuous stream of Russian history is to be sought
                        in the land where the Vikings first settled and in the adjoining basin of
                        the upper Volga. Here new principalities were founded and new agglomerations
                        of principalities came into existence, some of them having a grand-prince
                        who no longer professed allegiance to Kiev. Thus appeared the grand-prince
                        of Suzdal or Vladimir, of Tver, of Ryazan and of Moscow—all irreconcilable
                        rivals with little or no feeling of blood-relationship. The more ambitious
                        and powerful among them aspired not to succeed but to subdue the others and
                        to take possession of their territory, and the armed retainers, who were
                        wont formerly to wander about as free lances, gave up their roving mode of
                        life, settled down permanently in one principality, became landed
                        proprietors, and sought to share as boyars the princes’ authority.</p>
                   <p>Among the principalities of that northern region the first place was long
                        held by Novgorod. Since the days when Rurik had first chosen it as his
                        headquarters, the little town on the Volkhov had grown into a great
                        commercial city and a member of the Hanseatic league, and it had brought
                        under subjection a vast expanse of territory, stretching from the shores of
                        the Baltic to the Ural Mountains, and containing several subordinate towns,
                        of which the principal were Pskov, Nizhniy-Novgorod and Vyatka. Unlike the
                        ordinary Russian principalities, it had a republican rather than a
                        monarchical form of government. Indeed, it was not so much a principality as
                        a municipal republic of the Venetian type. It always had a prince, no doubt,
                        but he was engaged by formal contract without much attention being paid to
                        hereditary rights, and he was merely leader of the troops, while all the
                        political power remained in the hands of the civil officials and the <hi
                            rend="italic">Vetche,</hi> a popular assembly which was called together
                        in the market-place, as occasion required, by the tolling of the great bell.
                        Descendants of Rurik, impregnated with the pride of a dominant military
                        caste, did not much like serving those truculent, wilful burghers, and some
                        of them, after a time, voluntarily laid down their office and retired to
                        more congenial surroundings. Those of them who tried to have their own way
                        and came into conflict with the authorities had always to yield in the long
                        run, and they were Eable to be treated very unceremoniously, so that the
                        vulgar adage, “ If the prince is bad, into the mud with him!” became a maxim
                        of state policy.</p>
                   <p>There was here in the Russian land the germ of republicanism or
                        constitutional monarchy, but it was not destined to be developed. The
                        principality which was to become the nucleus of the future Russian empire
                        was not Novgorod with its democratic institutions, but its eastern neighbour
                        Moscow, in which the popular assembly played a very insignificant part, and
                        the supreme law was the will of the prince. The opposition which he
                        encountered came not from the burghers but from the boyars and the nobles.</p>
                   <p>II. <hi rend="italic">The Mongol or Tatar Domination, 1238-1462.—</hi>
                        Between Moscow and Novgorod there was a long and bitter rivalry, breaking
                        out occasionally into armed conflicts, and among the princes of the other
                        principalities the old struggle for precedence and territory w <hi
                            rend="sup">r</hi> ent on unceasingly until it was suddenly interrupted,
                        in the first half of the thirteenth century, by the unexpected irruption of
                        an irresistible foreign foe coming from the mysterious regions of the Far
                        East. “ For our sins,” says the Russian chronicler of the time, “ unknown
                        nations arrived. No one knew their origin or whence they came, or what
                        religion they practised. That is known only to God, and perhaps to wise men
                        learned in books.” The Russian princes first heard of them from the wild
                        nomadic Polovtsi, who usually pillaged the Russian settlers on the frontier
                        but who now preferred</p>

                   <p>friendship and said: “ These terrible strangers have taken our country, and
                        to-morrow they will take yours if you do not come and help us.” In response
                        to this call some Russian princes formed a league and went out eastward to
                        meet the foe, but they were utterly defeated in a great battle on the banks
                        of the Kalka (1224), which has remained to this day in the memory of the
                        Russian common people. Now the country was at the mercy of the invaders,
                        but, instead of advancing, they suddenly retreated and did not reappear for
                        thirteen years, during which the princes went on quarrelling and fighting as
                        before, till they were startled by a new invasion much more formidable than
                        its predecessor. This time the invaders came to stay, and they built for
                        themselves a capital, called Sarai, on the lower Volga. Here the commander
                        of “ the Golden Horde,” as the western section of the Mongol empire was
                        called, fixed his headquarters and represented the majesty of his sovereign
                        the grand khan who lived with the Great Horde in the valley of the Amur.
                        About the origin and character of these terrible invaders we are much better
                        informed than the early Russian chroniclers. The nucleus of the invading
                        horde was a small pastoral tribe in Mongolia, the chief of which, known
                        subsequently to Europe as Jenghiz Khan (<hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>), became
                        a mighty conqueror and created a vast empire stretching from China, across
                        northern and central Asia, to the shores of the Baltic and the valley of the
                        Danube —a heterogeneous state containing many nationalities held together by
                        purely administrative ties and by an enormous military force. For forty
                        years after the death of its founder it remained united under the authority
                        of a series of grand khans chosen from among his descendants, and then it
                        began to fall to pieces till the various fractions of it became independent
                        khanates.</p>
                   <p>The khanate closely connected with the history of Russia was that of Kipchak
                        or the Golden Horde, the khans of which settled, as we have seen, on the
                        lower Volga and built for themselves a capital called Sarai. Here they had
                        their headquarters and held Russia in subjection for nearly three centuries.</p>
                   <p>The term by which this subjection is commonly designated, the Mongol or
                        Tatar yoke, suggests ideas of terrible oppression, but in reality these
                        barbarous invaders from the Far East were not such cruel, oppressive
                        taskmasters as is generally supposed. In the first place, they never settled
                        in the country, and they had not much direct dealings with the inhabitants.
                        In accordance with the admonitions of Jenghiz to his children and
                        grandchildren, they retained their pastoral mode of life, so that the
                        subject races, agriculturists and dwellers in towns, were not disturbed in
                        their ordinary avocations. In religious matters they were extremely
                        tolerant. When they first appeared in Europe they were idolaters or
                        Shamanists, and as such they had naturally no religious fanaticism; but even
                        when they adopted Islam they remained as tolerant as before, and the khan of
                        the Golden Horde (Berkai) who first became a Mussulman allowed the Russians
                        to found a Christian bishopric in his capital. One of his successors, half a
                        century later, married a daughter of the Byzantine emperor, and gave his own
                        daughter in marriage to a Russian prince. These represent the bright side of
                        Tatar rule. It had its dark side also. So long as a great horde of nomads
                        was encamped on the frontier the country was liable to be invaded by an
                        overwhelming force of ruthless marauders. These invasions were fortunately
                        not frequent, but when they occurred they caused an incalculable amount of
                        devastation and suffering. In the intervals the people had to pay a fixed
                        tribute. At first it was collected in a rough-and-ready fashion by a swarm
                        of Tatar tax-gatherers, but about 1259 it was regulated by a census of the
                        population, and, finally, the collection of it was entrusted to the native
                        princes, so that the people were no longer brought</p>
                   <p>into direct contact with the Tatar officials.</p>
                   <p>By the princes the “ yoke ” was felt more keenly, and it was very galling.
                        In order to reply to accusations brought against them, or in order to be
                        confirmed in their function^, they had to travel to the Golden Horde on the
                        Volga or even to the camp of the grand khan in some distant part of Siberia,
                        and the journey was considered so perilous that many of them, before setting
                        out, made their last will and testament and wrote a parental admonition for
                        the guidance of their children. Nor were these precautions by any means
                        superfluous, for not a few princes died on the journey or were condemned to
                        death and executed for real or imaginary offences. Even when the visit to
                        the Horde did not ¿nd so tragically, it involved a great deal of anxiety and
                        expense, for the Mongol dignitaries had to be conciliated very liberally,
                        and it was commonly believed that the judges were more influenced by the
                        amount of the bribes than by the force of the arguments. The grand khan was
                        the lord paramount or suzerain of the Russian princes, and he had the force
                        required for making his authority respected. Ambitious members of the Rurik
                        dynasty, instead of seeking to acquire territory by conquest in the field,
                        now sought to attain their ends by intrigue and bribery at the Mongol court.</p>
                   <p>Of all the princes who sought to advance their fortunes in this way the most
                        dexterous and successful were those of Moscow. They made themselves
                        responsible for the tribute of other principalities as well as of their own,
                        and gradually they became lieutenants-general of their Mongol suzerain. So
                        long as the Mongol empire remained united and strong, they were most
                        submissive and obsequious, but as soon as it was weakened by internal
                        dissensions and began to fall to pieces, they assumed airs of independence,
                        intrigued with the insubordinate Tatar generals, retained for their own use
                        the tribute collected for the grand khan, and finally put themselves at the
                        head of the patriotic movement which aimed at throwing .off completely the
                        hated Mongol yoke. For this purpose Dimitri Donskoi formed in 1380 a
                        coalition of Russian princes, and gained a great victory over Khan Mamai of
                        the Golden Horde on the famous battlefield of Kulikovo, the memory of which
                        still lives in the popular legends. For some time longer the Tatars remained
                        troublesome neighbours, capable of invading and devastating large tracts of
                        Russian territory and of threatening even the city of Moscow, but the Horde
                        was now broken up into independent and mutually hostile khanates, and the
                        Moscow diplomatists could generally play off one khanate against the other,
                        so that there was no danger of the old political domination being
                        re-established.</p>
                   <p>Having thus freed themselves from Tatar control, the Moscow princes
                        continued to carry out energetically their traditional policy of extending
                        and consolidating their dominions at the expense of their less powerful
                        relations. Already Dimitri of the Don was called the grand-prince of all
                        Russia, but the assumption of such an ambitious title was hardly justified
                        by facts, because there were still in his time principalities with
                        grand-princes who claimed to be independent. The complete suppression of
                        these small moribund states and the creation of the autocratic tsardom of
                        Muscovy were the work of Ivan III., surnamed the Great, his son Basil and
                        his grandson Ivan IV., commonly known as Ivan the Terrible, whose united
                        reigns cover a period of 122 years (r462-1584).</p>
                   <p>III. <hi rend="italic">The Tsardom of Muscovy.—</hi> What may be called the
                        home policy of these three remarkable rulers consisted in absorbing the few
                        principalities which still remained independent, and in creating for
                        themselves an uncontrolled monarchical authority. In the pursuit of both of
                        these objects they were completely successful. When Ivan III. came to the
                        throne the remaining independent principalities were Great Novgorod, Pskov,
                        Tver, Ryazan and Novgorod-Seversk. He first directed his attention to
                        Novgorod, and by gradually undermining and then destroying the ancient
                        republican liberties he reduced the haughty city, which had long styled
                        itself Lord Novgorod the Great, to the rank of a provincial town. Then he
                        annexed its colonies and thereby extended his dominions to the Polar Ocean
                        and the Ural Mountains. At the same time he took possession of Tver, on the
                        ground that the prince had allied himself with Lithuania. His successor
                        Basil followed in his footsteps, and dealt with the municipal republic of
                        Pskov Was Ivan had dealt with Novgorod. Finding the inhabitants too much
                        attached to</p>
                    <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r05-0894" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0957.jp2"/>
                   <p>their ancient liberties, he abolished the popular assembly, removed the
                        great bell to Novgorod, installed his owi boyars in the administration,
                        transported 300 of the leading families to other localities, replaced them
                        by 300 families from Moscow, and left in the town a strong garrison of his
                        own troops. Ryazan shared the same fate. In 1521 the prince, being suspected
                        of forming an alliance with the Crimean Tatars, was summoned to Moscow and
                        arrested. Two years later the prince of Novgorod-Seversk was accused of
                        intriguing with the Poles and imprisoned for the rest of his life. Thus all
                        the principalities were brought under the power of Moscow, and in that
                        respect there remained nothing for Ivan the Terrible to do. He took
                        precautions, however, against any of the dead or moribund principalities
                        being resuscitated, and punished with merciless severity any attempt to
                        resist or undermine his authority.</p>
                   <p>With the suppression and absorption of the independent principalities the
                        problem was only half solved. The tsars of Muscovy meant to he autocratic
                        rulers alike in their old and in their new territories. Their forefathers
                        had been trained in the Tatar school of politics and administration, and in
                        their ideas of government they had come to resemble Tatar khans much more
                        than grand-princes of the old patriarchal type. Their autocratic tendencies
                        were fostered also by the Church. As Christianity was brought into Russia
                        from Constantinople it was only natural that the ecclesiastics, many of whom
                        were Greeks, should admire Byzantine ideals and recommend them as models to
                        he imitated. For the ambitious Moscow princes many of the Byzantine ideas
                        were very acceptable. They liked to consider themselves as the Lord’s
                        anointed, placed high above all ordinary mortals even of the most exalted
                        rank; and when Constantinople fell into the hands of the infidel they began
                        to imagine that, as the most powerful potentates of the Eastern Orthodox
                        world they were the protectors of the Orthodox faith and the political heirs
                        of the East Roman emperors. With a view to strengthen this claim Ivan III.
                        married a niece of the emperor Constantine Palaeologus, who had fallen
                        fighting when his capital was taken by the Turks (1453). From that moment
                        Ivan’s subjects noticed a change in his attitude towards them, and
                        attributed it to the evil influence of the Greek princess. In the old times
                        the grand-prince was simply <hi rend="italic">primus inter pares</hi> ai6ong
                        the minor princes, and these lived with their boyars almost on a footing of
                        equality. Now the tsar of Muscovy and of all Russia adopted the airs and
                        methods of a Tatar khan and surrounded himself with the pomp and splendours
                        of a Byzantine emperor. Ivan III., notwithstanding the influence of his
                        Greek consort, showed some respect for the ancient traditions and the
                        susceptibilities of those around him, but his successor Basil did not follow
                        his father’s example. All through his reign he preferred to employ as
                        officials men of humble origin, and habitually treated the boyars and great
                        nobles very unceremoniously. For disobedience to his orders he imprisoned a
                        hoyar who was his own brother-in-law, and he caused another to be beheaded
                        for complaining that the boyar-council was not consulted in important
                        affairs of state. A boyar of Nizhniy-Novgorod who allowed himself to
                        criticize the new order of things, and attributed the change to the
                        influence of the Greek princess, had his tongue cut out. From the
                        ecclesiastics Basil likewise 'insisted on unquestioning obedience, and he
                        did not hesitate to depose by his own authority a metropolitan who was at
                        that time the highest dignitary of the Russian Church. According to Siegmund
                        von Herberstein (1486-1566), an Austrian envoy who visited Moscow at that
                        period, no sovereign in Europe was obeyed like the grand-prince of Muscovy,
                        and his court was remarkable for barbaric luxury. In his palace were
                        numerous equerries, chamberlains and other court dignitaries, and when he
                        went out he was attended by a guard of young nobles dressed in gaudy</p>
                   <p>costumes and armed with silver halberds. <note anchored="true"

                   </p>
                   <p>Such radical changes naturally produced a great deal of dissatisfaction
                        among men of Slavonic temperament, whose grandfathers had been independent
                        princes, hoyars or free lances, and the malcontents could not adopt the old
                        practice of emigrating to some other principality. There was no longer
                        within the Russian land any independent principality in which an asylum
                        could be found, and emigration to a principality beyond the frontier, such
                        as Lithuania, was regarded as treason, for which the property of the
                        fugitive would be confiscated and his family might be punished. In these
                        circumstances the only outlet for discontent was sedition, and the
                        malcontents awaited impatiently a favourable opportunity for an attempt to
                        curb or overthrow the autocratic power. That opportunity came when Basil
                        died in 1533, leaving as successor a child only three years old, and the
                        chances seemed all on the side of the nobles; but the result belied the
                        current expectations, for the child came to be known in history as Ivan the
                        Terrible, and died half a century later in the full enjoyment of unlimited
                        autocratic power. The fierce struggle between autocratic tyranny and
                        oligarchic disorder, which went on in intermittent fashion during the whole
                        of his reign, cannot be here described in detail, but the chief incidents
                        may be mentioned.</p>
                   <p>During Ivan’s minority the country was governed, or rather misgoverned,
                        first by his mother, and then by rival factions led by great nobles such as
                        the princes Shuiski and Belski. Only once during this period did the young
                        tsar come forward and assert his authority. Having convoked his boyars he
                        reproached them collectively with robbing the treasury and committing acts,
                        of injustice, and he caused one of them, a Prince Shuiski who happened to be
                        in power at the moment, to be seized by his huntsmen and torn in pieces by a
                        pack of hounds, as a warning to others. Thus apparently he asserted his
                        authority, but in reality, being only thirteen years old, he was a mere
                        puppet in the hands of one of the opposition factions, who wished to oust
                        their rivals, and for the next four years the misgovernment of the nobles
                        went on as before. It was not till he was ahout seventeen that he took an
                        active part in the administration, and one of his first acts foreshadowed
                        his future policy: he insisted on the metropolitan crowning him, not as
                        grand-prince of Muscovy, but as tsar of all Russia (1547)- From the earliest
                        times the term tsar—a contraction of the word Caesar—had been applied to the
                        kings in Biblical history and the Byzantine emperors, and Ivan III. had
                        already been described in the Church service as “ the ruler and autocrat of
                        all Russia, the new Tsar Constantine in the new city of Constantine Moscow,”
                        but on no previous occasion had a grand-prince been crowned under that
                        title. A few months later occurred in Moscow a great fire, which destroyed
                        nearly the whole of the city, and a serious popular tumult, in which the
                        tsar’s uncle was murdered by the populace. Ivan regarded these events as a
                        punishment from Heaven for the neglect of his duties, and he began to attend
                        to public affairs under the influence of an enlightened priest called
                        Sylvester and an official of humble origin called Adashev. With the
                        assistance of these two counsellors he held in check the lawless, turbulent
                        nobles, and ruled justly, to the satisfaction of the people, for fourteen
                        years. Then, suddenly, for reasons which cannot easily be explained, he
                        inaugurated a reign of terror which lasted for twenty-four years and earned
                        for him the epithet of “the Terrible. ’’ Though there had been no open
                        insurrection, he caused many boyars and humbler persons to he executed, and
                        when some of the great nobles, fearing a similar fate, fled across the
                        frontier and tendered their allegiance to the prince of Lithuania, his
                        suspicion and indignation increased and he determined to adopt still more
                        drastic measures. For this purpose he organized, outside the regular
                        administration, a large corps of civil officials and armed retainers, whose
                        duty it was to obey him implicitly in all things; and with this force, which
                        rose rapidly from 1000 to 6000 men, he acted like a savage invader in a
                        conquered country. Accompanied by these so-called <hi rend="italic"
                            >Oprichniki,</hi> who have been compared to the Turkish Janissaries of
                        the worst period, he ruthlessly devastated large districts—with no other

                   <p>apparently than that of terrorizing the population and rewarding his
                        myrmidons—and during a residence of six weeks in Novgorod, lest the old
                        turbulent spirit of the municipal republic should revive, he massacred, it
                        is said, no less than 60,000 of the inhabitants, including many women and
                        children. It is quite possible, as some apologists suggest, that the number
                        of his victims may have been exaggerated, but that they arc to be counted by
                        thousands there can be no doubt. In the monastery of St Cyril has been
                        preserved a list of those for whom he requested the prayers of the Church,
                        the total being 3470. The only reference to Novgorod in this curious
                        document is: “ Remember, O Lord, the souls of thy Novgorodian servants to
                        the number of 1505 persons.” According to the Novgorodian annalists as many
                        as 1500 persons were sometimes put to death in a single day. Perhaps the
                        discrepancy is to be explained by supposing that the pious tsar did not
                        consider all his victims as servants of the Lord, whose souls deserved the
                        prayers of the faithful.</p>
                   <p>While thus uniting under their vigorous autocratic rule the small rival
                        principalities, the Moscow princes had to keep a watchful eye on their
                        eastern neighbours. The Golden Horde, long weakened by internal dissensions,
                        had now fallen into several khanates, the chief of which were Kazan,
                        Astrakhan and the Crimea. As these independent Tatar states were always
                        jealous of each other, and their jealousy often broke out in open hostility,
                        it was easy to prevent any combined action on their part; and as in each
                        khanate there were always several pretenders and contending factions,
                        Muscovite diplomacy had little difficulty in weakening them individually and
                        preparing for their annexation. In the case of Kazan and Astrakhan the
                        annexation was effected without any great effort in 1552-54, and two years
                        later the Bashkirs, who had likewise formed part of the great Mongol empire,
                        consented to pay tribute. On the other hand, the khans of the Crimea were
                        able, partly from their geographical position and partly from having placed
                        themselves under the protection of the sultans of Turkey, to resist
                        annexation for more than two centuries and to give the Muscovites a great
                        deal of trouble, not only by frequent raids and occasional invasions, but
                        also by allying themselves with the Western enemies of the tsars. As late as
                        1571 Moscow was pillaged by a Tatar horde; but there was no longer any
                        question of permanent political subjection to the Asiatics, and the Russian
                        frontier was being gradually pushed forward at the expense of the nomads of
                        the steppe by the constant advance of the agricultural population in quest
                        of virgin soil. These latter, like the colonists in the American Far West,
                        had to be constantly on the alert against the attacks of their troublesome
                        neighbours, and they accordingly organized themselves in semi-military
                        fashion. Those of them who lived on the outskirts of the pacified territory
                        adopted a mode of life similar to that of their hereditary opponents, and
                        constituted a peculiar class known as Cossacks, living more by flocks and
                        herds and by marauding expeditions than by agriculture. In the basins of the
                        southern rivers they formed semi-independent military communities. Those of
                        the Volga and the Don professed allegiance to the tsar of Muscovy, whilst
                        those of the Dnieper recognized at first as their suzerain the king of
                        Poland. In neither case did the allegiance involve strict obedience to
                        orders from the superior, and their loyalty was always in danger of being
                        troubled by their love of independence and equality and their desire for
                        loot. More than once they raided and pillaged in wholesale fashion the
                        territory they were supposed to protect. On the whole, however, at that
                        period as in more recent times, they contributed largely to the process of
                        territorial expansion. (See also Poland: <hi rend="italic">History.)</hi>
                   </p>
                   <p>Before the Eastern menace had been entirely removed the ambitious Moscow
                        princes had begun to look with envious eyes beyond their western frontier.
                        Here lay the principality of Lithuania and beyond it the kingdom of Poland,
                        two loosely conglomerated states which had been created by the Piast and
                        Gedymin dynasties in pretty much the same way as the tsardom of Muscovy had
                        been created by the descendants of Rurik. When the two became united under
                        one ruler towards the end of the 14th century they formed a broad strip of
                        territory stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea and separating Russia
                        from central Europe. For Russian ambition the barrier was a formidable one,
                        but it did not entirely preclude possibilities of expansion in a more or
                        less remote future. When examined closely it was found to contain many
                        internal flaws. In no sense could it be considered a homogeneous political
                        unit, for in Lithuania the majority of the population were Russian in
                        nationality, language and religion, whereas in Poland the great majority of
                        the inhabitants were Polish and Roman Catholic. Gradually, it is true, the
                        Lithuanian nobles, who possessed all the land and held the peasantry in a
                        state of serfage, adopted Polish nationality and culture, but this change
                        did not secure homogeneity, because the masses clung obstinately to their
                        old nationality and religion, and all the efforts of the Church of Rome to
                        bring them under papal authority proved fruitless. A further source of
                        weakness was the political organization. Nominally it was an hereditary
                        monarchy, but the warlike, turbulent nobles systematically encroached on the
                        sovereign power till they reduced it to a mere shadow and made it elective,
                        with the result that the kingdom of Poland, including the principality of
                        Lithuania, was at last, politically speaking, the most anarchical country in
                        Europe.</p>
                   <p>As the Muscovite and the Lithuano-Polish princes were equally ambitious and
                        equally anxious to widen their borders, they naturally came into conflict.
                        At first the Muscovite was decidedly the aggressor. On the death of Casimir,
                        king of Poland and grand-prince of Lithuania, in 1492, the kingdom and the
                        principality ceased to be united and Ivan III. considered he had a good
                        opportunity for attacking the latter. After a short campaign a peace was
                        concluded and Ivan’s daughter was given in marriage to the Lithuanian
                        grand-prince, but the matrimonial alliance did not improve the relations
                        between the two countries. On the contrary it served as a pretext for Ivan
                        to interfere in Lithuanian affairs. He not only insisted that his daughter’s
                        religion should be duly respected, but he constituted himself the protector
                        of the Orthodox population and this led to a new war in 1499, which went on
                        till 1503, when it was concluded by the cession to Russia of Chernigov,
                        Starodub and 17 other towns. His successor, Basil, tried to get himself
                        elected grand-prince of Lithuania when the throne became vacant by the death
                        of his brother-in-law in 1506, but the choice fell on the late prince’s
                        brother Sigismund, who was likewise elected king of Poland. The two
                        countries were thus once more united and better able to resist aggression,
                        but some of the great nobles were discontented and Basil hoped with their
                        assistance to attain his ends. He began war therefore in 1514 and at once
                        captured Smolensk, but in the following year he was defeated, and the war
                        dragged on during more than seven years, with varying successes and without
                        any important result. In the negotiations for peace the inordinate
                        pretensions of the Muscovite prince were put forward boldly: he not only
                        refused to restore Smolensk, but claimed Kiev and a number of other towns on
                        the ground that in the old time of the independent principalities they had
                        belonged to descendants of Rurik.</p>
                   <p>The policy of expansion westwards, inaugurated by Ivan III., was modified
                        and enlarged by Ivan the Terrible. The former had aimed simply at making
                        annexations in Lithuania; the latter aspired to obtaining a firm footing on
                        the Baltic coast and establishing direct relations, diplomatic and
                        commercial, with the Western Powers.</p>
                   <p>In this respect he was a precursor of Peter the Great, but he greatly
                        underestimated the difficulties of the task. To reach the Baltic he had to
                        overcome the resistance, not only of the Lithuanians and the Poles, but also
                        of the Teutonic and Livonian military orders, the Swedes and the Danes, who
                        all had possessions in the intervening territory and who all objected to the
                        barbarous Muscovites, already sufficiently formidable, strengthening
                        themselves by direct foreign trade with western Europe and especially by the
                        importation of arms and cunning</p>
                    <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r05-0896" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0959.jp2"/>
                   <p>foreign artificers. Like the European settlers on the coast of Africa in
                        more recent times, they wished the barbarians of the interior to be
                        restricted to the use of their primitive weapons. One of the Polish kings,
                        for example, threatened with death the English sailors who should attempt to
                        carry on the illicit trade in arms, on the ground that “ the Muscovite, who
                        is not only our opponent of to-day but the eternal enemy of all free
                        nations, should not be allowed to supply himself with cannons, bullets and
                        munitions or with artisans who manufacture arms hitherto unknown to those
                        barbarians.” This was precisely the reason why Ivan IV. was so anxious to
                        force his way to the coast. His grandfather had obtained from Venice an “
                        artist ” who undertook “ to build churches and palaces, to cast big bells
                        and cannons, to fire off the said cannons and to make every sort of castings
                        very cunningly”; and with the aid of that clever Venetian he had become the
                        proud possessor of a “ cannon-house,” subsequently dignified with the name
                        of “arsenal.” In imitation of the grandfather the grandson gave a commission
                        to a Saxon, in whom he had confidence, to collect artists and artisans in
                        Germany and bring them to Moscow, but he was prevented from carrying out his
                        scheme by the Livonian Order (1547)- A few years later (1553) he found
                        unexpectedly a different route for communication with the West. A ship of an
                        English squadron which was trying to reach China by the North-East passage,
                        entered the northern Dvina, and her captain, Richard Chancellor, journeyed
                        to Moscow in quest of opportunities for trade. He met with such a favourable
                        reception from the tsar that on his return to England a special envoy was
                        sent to Moscow by Queen Mary, and he succeeded in obtaining for his
                        countrymen the privilege of trading freely in Russian towns.</p>
                   <p>In return the Russians were allowed to trade freely in England. This
                        afforded great satisfaction to Ivan, but it did not entirely satisfy his
                        requirements, because the new route by the White Sea and North Cape was long
                        and uncertain and for a great part of the year communications were stopped
                        by the ice. He continued, therefore, his efforts to reach the Baltic coast,
                        and he soon came into collision with the Swedes. After a dilatory war of
                        three years he concluded a peace on the ground of free commercial relations,
                        and then he attacked the Livonian Order, on the pretext that the Livonian
                        town of Dorpat had not paid tribute according to ancient treaties. Finding
                        himself unable to resist the Muscovites, the grand master of the Order put
                        himself under Polish protection, and this led to a seven years’ war
                        (1563-70) with Poland, during which the Swedes and Danes intervened on their
                        own account. Ivan did not display much military talent, but he showed a
                        remarkable amount of tenacity. No sooner had he made peace with the Poles
                        and failed to get himself elected as their king, than he began a war with
                        the Swedes which dragged on for more than a decade (1572-1583), and before
                        it was ended he was again at war with Poland {1579-81). Though severely
                        tried by disappointments and defeats he never lost hope, and when he died in
                        1584 he was preparing to renew the struggle and endeavouring to form for
                        that purpose an alliance with England; his great idea, however, was not to
                        he realized till more than a century later, and meanwhile the tsardom of
                        Muscovy had to pass through a severe internal crisis in which its existence
                        was seriously endangered.</p>
                   <p>Ivan the Terrible had succeeded in stamping out ruthlessly all open
                        resistance to his will, and had created an autocratic government of the
                        Oriental type; but the elements of disorder were still lying beneath the
                        surface, and as soon as the cunning, energetic despot died they reappeared.
                        His son and successor, Theodore (Feodor), was a weak man of saintly
                        character, very ill fitted to consolidate his father’s work and maintain
                        order among the ambitious, turbulent nobles; but he had the good fortune to
                        have an energetic brother-in-law, with no pretensions to sanctity, called
                        Boris Godunov, who was able, with the tsar’s moral support, to keep his
                        fellow-boyars in order. This he did during fourteen years, and his
                        administration was signalized by two important innovations—the attaching of
                        the peasants</p>
                   <p>to the land <hi rend="italic">(adseriplio glebae)</hi> and the creation of
                        the patriarchate —both of which deserve a passing notice.</p>
                   <p>Boris has often been called the creator of serfage in Russia, but in reality
                        he merely accelerated a process which was the natural result of economic
                        conditions. In a primitive, thinly populated, agricultural country, in which
                        the demand for agricultural labour greatly exceeds the supply, the value of
                        land is in proportion to the number of permanent labourers settled on it,
                        and the landed proprietors naturally try to attract to their estates as many
                        peasants as possible; and in this competition the large proprietors have
                        evidently an advantage over their humbler and weaker rivals. Such had been
                        for a considerable time the condition of Russia, and the small proprietors
                        were now becoming so impoverished that they could no longer fulfil their
                        duties to the state. The remedy they proposed was that the labourers should
                        be prohibited from migrating from one estate to another, and an order to
                        that effect was issued, with the result that the peasants, being no longer
                        able to change their domicile and seek new employers, fell practically under
                        the unlimited power of the proprietors on whose land they resided. This
                        change was, of course, popular among the lower and middle ranks of the
                        landlord class, but was very displeasing to the great nobles.</p>
                   <p>The second of the two innovations above mentioned was popular among all
                        classes. Hitherto the highest authority in the Russian Church was the
                        metropolitan, w <hi rend="sup">T</hi> ho was nominally under the
                        jurisdiction of the patriarch of Constantinople, and as soon as
                        Constantinople fell into the hands of the infidel, and the tsars of Muscovy
                        claimed to be the successors of the Byzantine emperors, it seemed right and
                        proper that the Russian Church should become autocephalous and he governed
                        by an independent Russian patriarch. The change was very dexterously
                        effected by Godunov, with the formal assent of the Eastern Orthodox Church
                        as a whole, and one of his adherents was placed on the patriarchal throne.</p>
                   <p>Having thus gained the support of a large majority of the landed proprietors
                        and the ecclesiastics, Boris Godunov increased his influence to such an
                        extent that on the death of Tsar Feodor without male issue in 1598 he was
                        elected his successor by a Great National Assembly.</p>
                   <p>His short reign was not so successful as his administration under the weak
                        Feodor. The oligarchical party considered it a disgrace to obey a simple
                        boyar; conspiracies were frequent, the rural districts were desolated by
                        famine and plague, great bands of armed brigands roamed about the country
                        committing all manner of atrocities, the Cossacks on the frontier were
                        restless, and the government showed itself incapable of maintaining order.
                        Under the influence of the great nobles who had unsuccessfully opposed the
                        election of Godunov, the general discontent took the form of hostility to
                        him as a usurper, and rumours were heard that the late tsar’s younger
                        brother Dimitri (Demetrius), supposed to be dead, was still alive and in
                        hiding. In 1603 a man calling himself Dimitri, and professing to be the
                        rightful heir to the throne, appeared in Poland, and a few months later he
                        crossed the frontier with a large force of Poles, Russian exiles, German
                        mercenaries and Cossacks from the Dnieper and the Don. In reality the
                        younger son of Ivan the Terrible had been strangled before his brother’s
                        death—by orders, it was said, of Godunov—and the mysterious individual who
                        was impersonating him was an . impostor; but he was regarded as the rightful
                        heir by a large section of the population, and immediately after Boris’s
                        death in 1605 he made his triumphal entry into Moscow. Thus began a period
                        of Russian history commonly called “ the Troublous Times, ” which lasted
                        until 1613. (See Demetrius, Pseudo-.)</p>
                   <p>The reign of Dirititri was short and uneventful. Before a year had passed a
                        conspiracy was formed against him by an ambitious noble called Basil
                        (Vassili) Shuiski, and he was assassinated in the Kremlin. The chief
                        conspirator, Shuiski, seized the power and was elected tsar by an Assembly
                        composed of his faction, but neither</p>
                    <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r05-0897" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0960.jp2"/>
                   <p>the ambitious boyars, nor the pillaging Cossacks, nor the German mercenaries
                        were satisfied with the change, and soon a new impostor, likewise calling
                        himself Dimitri, son of Tsar Ivan, came forward as the rightful heir. Like
                        his predecessor, he enjoyed the protection and support of the Polish king,
                        Sigismund III., and was strong enough to compel Shuiski to abdicate; but as
                        soon as the throne was vacant Sigismund put forward as a candidate his own
                        son, Wladislaus. To this latter the people of Moscow swore allegiance on
                        condition of his maintaining</p>
                   <p>Orthodoxy and granting certain rights, and on this understanding the Polish
                        troops were allowed to occupy the city and the Kremlin. Then Sigismund
                        unveiled his real plan, which was to obtain the throne not for his son but
                        for himself. This scheme did not please any ‘of the contending factions and
                        it roused the anti-Catholic fanaticism of the masses. At the same time it
                        was displeasing to the Swedes, who had become rivals of the Poles on the
                        Baltic coast, and they started a false Dimitri of their own in Novgorod.</p>
                   <p>Russia was thus in a very critical condition. The throne was vacant, the
                        great nobles quarrelling among themselves, the Cathoh'c Poles in the Kremlin
                        of Moscow, the Protestant Swedes in Novgorod, and enormous bands of brigands
                        everywhere. The severity of the crisis produced a remedy, in the form of a
                        patriotic rising of the masses under the leadership of a butcher called
                        Minin and a Prince Pozharski. In a short time the invaders were expelled,
                        and a Grand National Assembly elected as tsar Michael Romfinov, the young
                        son of the metropolitan Philaret,</p>
                   <p>who was connected by marriage with the late dynasty.</p>
                   <p>During the reign of Michael (1613-45) the new dynasty came to be accepted by
                        all classes, and the country recovered to some extent from the disorders and
                        exhaustion from which it had suffered so severely; but it was not strong
                        enough to pursue at once an aggressive foreign policy, and the tsar
                        prudently determined to make peace with Sweden and conclude an armistice of
                        fourteen years with Poland. At the conclusion of the armistice in 1632,
                        during a short interregnum in Poland, he attempted to avenge past injuries
                        and recover lost territory; but the campaign was not successful, and in 1634
                        he signed a definitive treaty by no means favourable to Russia. That lesson
                        was laid to heart, and he subsequently maintained a purely defensive
                        attitude. As a precaution against Tatar invasions he founded fortified towns
                        on his southern frontiers—Tambov, Kozlov, Penza and Simbirsk; but when the
                        Don Cossacks offered him Azov, which they had captured from the Turks, and a
                        National Assembly, convoked for the purpose of considering the question,
                        were in favour of accepting it as a means of increasing Russian influence on
                        the Black Sea, he decided that the town should be restored to the sultan,
                        much to the disappointment of its captors.</p>
                   <p>In the reign of Michael's successor, Alexius (1645-76), the country
                        recovered its strength so rapidly that the tsar was tempted to revive the
                        energetic aggressive policy and put forward claims to Livonia, Lithuania and
                        Little Russia, but he was obliged to moderate his pretensions. Livonia
                        continued to be under Swedish rule, and Lithuania remained united with
                        Poland. Some advantages, however, were obtained. Smolensk and Chernigov were
                        definitely incorporated in the tsardom of Muscovy, and great</p>
                   <p>progress was made towards the absorption of Little Russia.</p>
                   <p>Roughly speaking, Little Russia, otherwise called the Ukraine, may be
                        described as the basin of the Dnieper southward of the 51st parallel of
                        latitude. In the 16th century it was a thinly populated region inhabited
                        chiefly by Cossacks, speaking the so-called Little</p>
                   <p>Russian dialect, and until 1569 it formed nominally part of Lithuania, but
                        was practically independent. In that year, when Lithuania and Poland were
                        permanently united, it fell under Polish rule, and the Polish government
                        considered it necessary to tame the wild inhabitants and bring them under
                        regular administration. For this decision there were good reasons, for those
                        turbulent sons of the steppe paid no taxes and were much given to
                        brigandage, and their raiding propensities occasionally created
                        international difficulties with the khan of the Crimea and the sultan of
                        Turkey. It was proposed, therefore, in 1576, that 6000 families should be
                        registered as a militia under a Polish Hetman for the protection of the
                        country against Tatar raids, and that the remainder of the inhabitants
                        should be assimilated to the ordinary peasants of Poland. This arrangement
                        was very distasteful to all classes. The registered Cossacks objected to
                        being placed under a Hetman not freely chosen by themselves, and those who
                        were not included in the militia objected still more strongly to the
                        prospect of being reduced to the miserable condition of Polish serfs. To
                        escape this danger many of them moved down the river and settled on the
                        waste lands beyond the rapids. Here, about 1590, was founded an independent
                        military colony called the <hi rend="italic">Setch,</hi> the members of
                        which, recognizing no authority but that of their own elected officers,
                        lived by fishing, hunting and making raids on the Tatars, and were always
                        ready to assist their less fortunate countrymen in resisting Polish
                        aggression. For half a century the struggle between the two races went on
                        with varying success, but on the whole the Polish government proved stronger
                        than its insubordinate subjects, and about 1638 it seemed to have attained
                        its object. Polish proprietors settled in large numbers on the Cossack
                        territory, and great efforts were made, with the assistance of the Jesuits,
                        to bring the Orthodox population under papal authority. But for both
                        proprietors and Jesuits a surprise was in store. Threatened seriously in
                        their liberty and their faith, the people rose with greater enthusiasm than
                        before, and a general insurrection, in which the peasants joined, spread
                        over the whole country under the leadership of Bogdan Chmielnicki or
                        Khmelnitski (g.v.), whose name is still remembered in the Ukraine. As in all
                        previous insurrections the Poles proved stronger in the field, and
                        Khmelnitski in desperation sought foreign assistance, first in
                        Constantinople and then in Moscow. For some time Tsar Alexius hesitated,
                        because he knew that intervention could entail a war with Poland, but after
                        consulting a National Assembly on the subject, he decided to take Little
                        Russia under his protection, and in January 1654 a great Cossack assembly
                        ratified the arrangement, on the understanding that a large part of the old
                        local autonomy should be preserved. In the expected war with Poland, which
                        followed quickly, the Russians were so successful that the arrangement was
                        upheld; but it was soon found that the Cossacks, though they professed
                        unbounded devotion to the Orthodox tsar, disliked Muscovite, quite as much
                        as Polish, interference in their internal affairs, and some of their leaders
                        were in favour of substituting federation with Poland for annexation by
                        Russia. In these circumstances the tsar was induced to accept a compromise,
                        and signed in 1667 the treaty of Andrussovo, by which the territory in
                        dispute was partitioned and the middle course of the Dnieper became the
                        frontier between Russia and Poland.</p>
                   <p>In the reign of Alexius a conflict took place between the tsar and the
                        patriarch, which is often described as a conflict between Church and State,
                        and which illustrates the relations between the temporal and the spiritual
                        power in Russian state-organization. Until the beginning of the 17th century
                        the Byzantine tradition that in all matters outside the sphere of dogma the
                        ecclesiastical is subordinate to the civil power had been observed in
                        Russia; but the traditional conceptions had been to some extent undermined
                        during the reign of Michael, when the metropolitan Philaret, who was the
                        tsar’s father <hi rend="italic">(vide supra),</hi> became patriarch and was
                        associated with his son in the government on a footing of equality. Like the
                        tsar, he had the official title of “ Great Lord ” <hi rend="italic">(veliki
                            gosud&amp;r),</hi> and he had his palace, his court-dignitaries, his
                        retinue, his boyars and his officials all organized on the model of those of
                        the sovereign. Without his assent and blessing no important decisions were
                        taken, all state documents emanating from the highest authority bore his
                        signature, and he was regarded, both in the official world and by the</p>
                    <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r05-0898" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0961.jp2"/>
                   <p>public generally, as the tsar’s equal in rank and dignity. His immediate
                        successors, being men of humble origin and submissive character, made no
                        pretensions to such an exalted position, but when the haughty, ambitious and
                        energetic Nikon, who enjoyed in large measure the affection and favour of
                        the devout Tsar Alexius, became patriarch, he took Philaret as his model,
                        and propounded, like the popes in western Europe, the doctrine that the
                        spiritual is higher than the temporal power, the former corresponding to the
                        sun and the latter to the moon in the firmament. In accordance with this
                        view he declared that the patriarch was the image of Christ, the head of the
                        Church, and was therefore subject to no earthly authority, and he complained
                        of the tsar’s interference in ecclesiastical affairs. His pretensions and
                        his haughty dictatorial manner at last exhausted the tsar’s patience, and he
                        was formally deposed and exiled to a monastery. As no voice was raised in
                        his defence and the decision of the ecclesiastical council which condemned
                        him was universally accepted without protest, we must conclude that the
                        conflict was not really between Church and State but simply between the
                        haughty, ambitious Patriarch Nikon and the devout, long-suffering Tsar
                        Alexius. The incident afforded a new proof, where no proof was required,
                        that the autocratic power in Russia was supreme. In order to prevent such
                        incidents in future, Peter the Great abolished the patriarchate altogether,
                        and entrusted the administration of the Church to a synod entirely dependent
                        on the government.</p>
                   <p>Much more important in its consequences was Nikon’s activity as an
                        ecclesiastical reformer. During the Russian Dark Ages certain clerical
                        errors had crept into the liturgical books and certain peculiarities had
                        been adopted in the ritual. These had been detected and pointed out by
                        learned ecclesiastics of Kiev, where some of the ancient learning of
                        Byzantium had been preserved, and Nikon determined to make the necessary
                        corrections. He determined also to introduce into the Church many desirable
                        reforms. His project was approved by an ecclesiastical council and was
                        supported by the tsar, but it met with violent opposition from a large
                        section of the clergy, and it alarmed the ignorant masses, who regarded any
                        alterations in the ritual, however insignificant they might be, as heretical
                        and very dangerous to salvation. When put into execution the project
                        produced in the Russian Church a great schism and numerous fantastic sects.
                        The cruel persecutions instituted by the authorities with a view to securing
                        conformity increased the number and fanaticism of the schismatics and
                        heretics, and created among them a widespread belief that the reign of
                        Antichrist, foretold in the Apocalypse, was at hand. In support of this
                        idea, independently of the ecclesiastical innovations, many significant
                        facts could be adduced. Numerous foreigners had been allowed to settle in
                        Moscow and to build for themselves a heretical church, and their strange
                        unholy customs had been adopted by not a few courtiers and great
                        dignitaries. Matveyev, the most influential of the boyars, had married a
                        foreigner who conversed freely with her husband’s male friends, contrary to
                        the Muscovite notions of respectability and decorum, and his house, in which
                        the tsar was a frequent visitor, was furnished and decorated in foreign
                        fashion. Books on mundane •subjects, not at all conducive to the spiritual
                        edification of the faithful, were read by the tsar’s counsellors, and a
                        theatre had been erected, in which the tsar often witnessed very unedifying
                        dramas and ballets. Worst of all, the Orthodox tsar occasionally abandoned
                        the decorous flowing robes of his venerated ancestors, and appeared publicly
                        in the unseemly costume of heretical foreigners, whilst his consort, when
                        carried through the streets in a Utter, did not conceal her face from the
                        public gaze. Such innovations troubled deeply the pious souls of the
                        conservative Muscovites, and confirmed them in their repugnance to. accept
                        the ecclesiastical reforms. Though this original fanaticism gradually cooled
                        and the rigorists had to make many concessions to the exigencies of
                        practical life, a large section of the Russian people remained outside the
                        official fold, so that at the present day, if we may credit the most
                        competent authorities, the schismatics and heretics number more than twelve
                        millions.</p>
                   <p>While the Muscovites of the upper classes were thus beginning to abandon
                        their old oriental habits, their government was preparing to make a
                        political evolution of a similar kind. Notwithstanding the efforts of the
                        Poles and the Military Orders to exclude Russia from the shores of the
                        Baltic and keep her in a state of isolation, she was coming slowly into
                        closer relations with central and western Europe. The emperor, the
                        governments of England, Holland, France and Sweden, and even the Grand Turk
                        made advances to the tsar. Some of them wished to gain him as an ally
                        against their rivals, whilst others hoped to obtain from him commercial
                        privileges and permission to trade directly with Persia. The political and
                        the commercial proposals were alike received with coldness, because the
                        native diplomatists had aims which could not be reconciled completely with
                        the policy of any other country, and the native merchants were afraid of
                        foreign competition. The negotiations gave, therefore, little tangible
                        result, but they helped to prepare the way for the new order of things which
                        was soon to be introduced by Alexius’s son, Peter the Great.</p>
                   <p>Before reaching the new order of things, the country had to pass through an
                        internal crisis similar to that which followed the death of Ivan the
                        Terrible, but not nearly so severe. Alexius had been twice married and had
                        left several children by each of his wives, and, as generally happened in
                        such cases, a struggle for power ensued between the two rival families. The
                        late tsar’s eldest son, Theodore, was weak in health and died without male
                        issue after an uneventful reign of six years (1676-82). As the second son,
                        Ivan, next in the order of succession, was almost an imbecile, the third
                        son, Peter, born of the second marriage, was proclaimed tsar, and his
                        maternal relations became the dominant faction, but their triumph was of
                        very * short duration. An ambitious, energetic sister of Ivan, well known in
                        Russian history as Sophia Alexeyevna,instigated the <hi rend="italic"
                            >stryeltsi(slrelitz),</hi> as the troops of the unreformed standing army
                        were called, to upset the arrangement. After making a tumult in the Kremlin
                        and assassinating several of the men in power, they insisted that Ivan
                        should be proclaimed tsar conjointly with Peter, and that Sophia should act
                        as regent during the minority of the two young sovereigns. She accepted
                        unhesitatingly the difficult and dangerous post, and ruled autocratically
                        for seven years (1682-S9), but this did not satisfy her ambition. Having
                        discovered that Peter, who had reached the age of seventeen, was thinking of
                        taking the administration into his own hands, she conspired against him with
                        the commander of the <hi rend="italic">stryeltsi</hi> and some of his
                        maternal relations; but she was circumvented by the rival faction and
                        interned in a convent, and Peter’s mother was put in her place. The
                        importance of these incidents, which are very characteristic of political
                        life in the tsardom of Muscovy, will appear in the sequel.</p>
                   <p>If Peter really thought of taking the administration into his own hands, he
                        very soon abandoned the idea and returned to the irregular suburban life he
                        had led during his half-sister’s regency—associating with foreigners who
                        could teach him the mechanical arts of the West, drilling troops, building
                        and sailing boats, forming projects for the creation of a great navy,
                        indulging publicly in Bacchanalian revels and boisterous amusements not at
                        all to the taste of his pious countrymen, and appearing in Moscow as
                        Orthodox tsar only on great ceremonial occasions. Already the desire to make
                        his country a great naval power was becoming his ruling passion, and when he
                        found by experience that the White Sea, Russia’s sole maritime outlet, had
                        great practical inconveniences as a naval base, he revived the project of
                        getting a firm footing on the shores of the Black Sea or the Baltic. At
                        first he gave the preference to the former,- and with the aid of a flotilla
                        of small craft, constructed on a tributary of the Don, he succeeded in
                        capturing Azov from the Turks. Greatly elated by this success, he
                        recommended to the council of boyars the construction of a powerful fleet
                        for carrying on war with the infidel, and he himself went abroad to learn
                        more about shipbuilding and useful foreign inventions, and to prepare</p>

                   <p>diplomatically the projected crusade. His foreign tour, during which he
                        visited Germany, Holland, England, France and Austria, lasted nearly a year
                        and a half, and was suddenly interrupted, when on his way from Vienna to
                        Venice to study the construction of war-galleys, by the alarming news that
                        the turbulent <hi rend="italic">stryeltsi</hi> of Moscow had mutinied anew
                        with the intention of placing Sophia on the throne. On arriving in Moscow he
                        found that the mutiny had been suppressed and the ringleaders punished, but
                        he considered it necessary to reopen the investigation and act with
                        exemplary severity. Of the surviving mutineers over twelve hundred were
                        executed, some of them by his own hand, and the entire corps was disbanded.</p>
                   <p>From this moment may be dated the personal reign of Peter, for he now began
                        to direct personally all branches of the administration, and governed with
                        indefatigable vigour for twenty-seven years, during which he greatly
                        increased the area and profoundly modified the internal condition of his
                        country. At first he concentrated his attention on foreign affairs. During
                        his foreign tour he had discovered that the idea of a grand crusade against
                        the infidel was irrealizable, for France was, according to her traditional
                        policy,-the ally of the sultan, Austria wished to avoid trouble on her
                        eastern frontier in order to devote her energies to the question of the
                        Spanish succession, and all the other countries which he wished to draw into
                        the coalition had good reasons of their own for desiring the maintenance of
                        peace in eastern Europe. For his Baltic schemes, on the contrary, he had
                        found the ground well prepared. During a halt of a few days in Poland on his
                        way back from Vienna, King Augustus had explained to him a project for
                        partitioning the trans-Baltic provinces of Sweden, by which Poland should
                        recover Livonia and annex Esthonia, Russia should obtain Ingria and Karelia,
                        and Denmark should take possession of Holstein. As Sweden was known to be
                        exhausted by the long wars of Gustavus Adolphus and his successors, and
                        weakened by internal dissensions, the dismemberment seemed an easy matter,
                        and Peter embarked on the scheme with a light heart; but his illusions were
                        quickly dispelled by the eccentric young Swedish king, Charles XII., who
                        arrived suddenly in Esthonia and completely routed the Russian army before
                        Narva. Thus began the so-called Northern War, which lasted intermittently
                        for more than twenty years, and was terminated by the treaty of Nystad
                        (Sept, io, 1721). By that treaty Peter acquired not only Ingria and Karelia,
                        as originally contemplated, but also Livonia, Esthonia and part of Finland.
                        The problem of obtaining a firm footing on the Baltic coast, on which Ivan
                        the Terrible had squandered his resources to no purpose, was now solved
                        satisfactorily.</p>
                   <p>Peter’s other favourite scheme, that of acquiring the command of the Black
                        Sea, was as far from realization as ever. In the midst of the Northern War,
                        shortly after the great Russian victory of Poltava (1709), the sultan, at
                        the instigation of Swedish and French agents, determined to recover Azov,
                        and made great military preparations for that purpose. Having annihilated at
                        Poltava the army of Charles XII., Peter was not at all indisposed to renew
                        the struggle with Turkey, and began the campaign in the confident hope of
                        making extensive conquests; but he had only got as far as the Pruth when he
                        found himself surrounded by a great Turkish army, and, in order to extricate
                        himself from his critical position, he had to sign a humiliating treaty by
                        which Azov and other conquests were restored to the sultan. His dreams of
                        freeing the Christians from the yoke of the infidel had to be abandoned, and
                        the conquest of the northern shores of the Black Sea was postponed till the
                        reign of Catherine II.</p>
                   <p>Those tedious and exhausting wars did not prevent Peter from attending to
                        internal affairs, and he displayed as a reformer even more vigour and
                        tenacity than as a general in the field. His first reforms were connected
                        with the army. Several of his immediate predecessors had come to recognize
                        that Russia, with her antiquated military organization, was unable to cope
                        with her Western neighbours, and</p>
                   <p>had begun to organize, with the help of foreigners, a military force more in
                        accordance with modern requirements; but the progress made in that direction
                        bad been slow and unsatisfactory. Unlike his predecessors, Peter was in a
                        hurry to realize his plans, and he set to work at once. In less than two
                        years from the time of disbanding the <hi rend="italic">stryeltsi</hi> he
                        contrived to create an army of 40,000 men. This army, it is true, was so
                        inefficient that it was completely routed by the Swedish king with a most
                        inferior force, but it was improved gradually until it learned to conquer
                        its Swedish opponents. To accomplish such a feat it was necessary, of
                        course, to expend large sums of money; and as the country could ill bear an
                        increase of taxation, the whole financial system had to be improved and the
                        natural resources of the country had to be developed. At the same time the
                        military and financial requirements dislocated the local and central
                        administration, and consequently a series of radical administrative reforms
                        had to be undertaken. Thus one reform led to another; but Peter was not
                        dismayed by the magnitude of the task, and worked vigorously in all
                        departments with a sublime disregard for the clamour of reactionary
                        opponents and for the feelings and prejudices of his subjects in general. A
                        prudent ruler in his position would have sought to preserve the outward
                        forms while changing the inner substance, but Peter was ncjt at all prudent
                        in that sense. Very often he wantonly provoked opposition, as when he shaved
                        off his beard and compelled his chief officials to do likewise, though he
                        well knew that the operation was regarded by the ignorant masses and the
                        pious of all ranks as a sinful defacing of the image of God. In his eyes the
                        beard was a symbol of the old regime, and as such it must be removed.
                        Reckless of consequences, he swept away the venerated ceremonial formalities
                        which his ancestors bad scrupulously observed, openly scoffed at ancient
                        usage, habitually dressed in foreign costume, and generally chose foreign
                        heretics as his boon companions. In adopting foreign innovations, he showed,
                        like the Japanese of the present day, no sentimental preference for any
                        particular nation, and was ready to borrow from the Germans, Dutch, English,
                        Swedes or French whatever seemed best suited for his purpose. The
                        innovations, it must be admitted, did not prove so efficient as he expected,
                        because human nature and traditional habits cannot be changed as quickly as
                        institutions. When the Boyar Duma became the Senate, and the <hi
                            rend="italic">Prikazi</hi> or administrative departments were organized
                        under the name of Colleges, and when every important town was endowed with a
                            <hi rend="italic">Rathhaus,</hi> a <hi rend="italic"
                            >Polizeimeister,</hi> gilds, aldermen, and all the municipal
                        paraphernalia of western Europe, the vices of the old institutions survived
                        in the new. Notwithstanding the changes in organization and terminology, the
                        officials remained ignorant, indolent, careless, indifferent to the public
                        welfare, high-handed and extortionate, and the local self-government which
                        was intended to enlighten and control them proved sadly wanting in vitality
                        and practically worthless. So inefficient, indeed, were the reforms as a
                        whole, and so unsuited to the national character and customs, that the
                        Slavophil critics of a later date could maintain plausibly the paradoxical
                        thesis that in regard to internal administration Peter was anything but a
                        national benefactor. However that may be, it must be confessed even by
                        Slavophils that he dragged his countrymen, more by force than by persuasion,
                        from the paths of traditional routine and pushed them along with all his
                        might on the broad road of progress in the modern sense of the term.
                        Abandoning the ancient Muscovite capital, where many influential personages
                        were fanatically hostile to his innovations and not a few of the
                        superstitious inhabitants regarded him with horror as Antichrist, he built
                        at the mouth of the Neva a new capital which was to serve as “ a window
                        through which his people might look into Europe ”; and laying aside the
                        national title of tsar he proclaimed himself (1711) emperor (Imperator) of
                        all Russia—much to the surprise and indignation of foreign diplomatic
                        chancelleries, which resented the audacity of a semi-barbarous potentate in
                        claiming to be</p>

                   <p>of various nationalities, was called together at Moscow to consider the
                        needs of the empire and the means of satisfying them. The instructions for
                        the guidance of the Assembly were prepared by the empress herself and were,
                        as she frankly admitted, the result of “ pillaging the philosophers of the
                        West,” especially Montesquieu and Beccaria. As many of the democratic
                        principles frightened her more moderate and experienced advisers, she wisely
                        refrained from immediately putting them into execution. After holding more
                        than 200 sittings the so-called Commission was dissolved without getting
                        beyond the realm of theory and <hi rend="italic">pia desiieria.</hi>
                        Subsequently very important reforms were introduced, not by the vote of an
                        assembly, but by the <hi rend="italic">fiat</hi> of the autocratic power.
                        The large territorial units .of administration created by Peter the Great
                        were broken up into so-called “ governments ” <hi rend="italic"
                            >(gubernii)</hi> and further subdivided into districts <hi rend="italic"
                            >(uyezdy),</hi> and each government was confided to the care of a
                        governor and a vice-governor assisted by a council. A certain amount of
                        local self-government was entrusted to the nobles and the burghers, and the
                        judicial administration was thoroughly reorganized in an enlightened ana
                        humane spirit. The great estates of the Church, on which were settled about
                        a million serfs, were secularized and assimilated with the state-domains.</p>
                   <p>At one moment the idea of emancipating all the serfs was entertained, but
                        the project was speedily abandoned, because it would have alienated the
                        nobles—the only class on which Catherine could rely for support. To
                        conciliate them she greatly extended the area of serfage by making large
                        grants of land and serfs to courtiers and public servants who had specially
                        distinguished themselves. About education a great deal was spoken and
                        written, and a certain amount of progress was effected. Whilst primary
                        education was neglected, secondary schools were created in the principal
                        towns and a Russian Academy was founded in St Petersburg. In the imperial
                        court, so far as outward decorum and refinement were concerned, there was an
                        immense improvement, and the upper section of the old Russian <hi
                            rend="italic">Dvorianstvo</hi> became a noblesse with French
                        aristocratic conceptions and ideals. A taste for French literature spread
                        rapidly, and the poets and dramatists of Paris found clever imitators in St
                        Petersburg.</p>
                   <p>By such means Catherine made herself very popular in the upper ranks of
                        society, but as a woman and a usurper who did little or nothing to lighten
                        the burdens of the people she failed to gain the loyalty and devotion of the
                        masses. In the first part of her reign popular discontent found expression
                        in various forms, and on one occasion it produced a serious insurrection. In
                        1773 a Don Cossack called Pugachev, who was so uneducated that he could not
                        even sign the manifestoes written for him, declared himself to be Peter
                        III., and announced that he was going to St Petersburg to punish his
                        faithless wife and place his son Paul on the throne. Many believed, or
                        affected to believe, in the pretender, and .in a short time he gathered
                        around him a large force of Cossacks, peasants, Tatars and Tchuvash, swept
                        over the basin of the lower Volga, executed mercilessly the landed
                        proprietors, seized and pillaged the town of Kazan, and kept the whole
                        country in a state of alarm for more than a year. Finally, after a crushing
                        defeat in which 2000 of the insurgents were killed and 6000 taken prisoners,
                        he was betrayed by some of his followers and executed in Moscow. His name
                        and exploits still live in the popular legends, and the insurrection is
                        often referred to in revolutionary pamphlets as a laudable popular protest
                        against tyrannical autocracy.</p>
                   <p>In foreign affairs Catherine devoted her attention mainly to pushing forward
                        the Russian frontier westwards and southwards, and as France was the
                        traditional ally of Sweden, Poland and Turkey, she adopted at first the
                        so-called <hi rend="italic">système du Nord,</hi> that is to say, a close
                        alliance with Prussia, England and Denmark against</p>
                   <p>France and Austria, who had buried their traditional enmity in the famous
                        alliance of 1756. The first step westwards was taken in Courland, which lay
                        between Russian territory and the Baltic coast. At the time of her accession
                        the duchy was ruled by a son of the Polish king Augustus III., and he gave a
                        pretext for aggression by refusing to allow Russian troops returning from
                        the Seven Years’ War to pass through his territory. For this unfriendly act
                        he was deposed and replaced by Biren, who had previously been duke of
                        Courland (1737-40) and had since been an exile in Siberia and Yaroslav.
                        Under Biren (1763-69) and his son and successor (1769-95), as nominees of
                        Catherine, Courland was completely under Russian influence until 1795, when
                        it was formally incorporated with the empire. The next country to feel the
                        expansive tendencies of Russia was Poland, which had now very little power
                        of resistance. Whilst Russia, Austria, Prussia and France were becoming
                        powerful monarchies with centralized administration, Poland had remained a
                        weak feudal republic with an elected king chosen under foreign influence and
                        fettered by constitutional restrictions. All political authority was in the
                        hands of turbulent nobles who quarrelled among themselves, who were always
                        inclined to submit the questions at issue to the arbitrament of arms, and
                        who did not scruple to invite foreign powers to intervene on their behalf.
                        The middle classes, which were making other countries rich and powerful,
                        existed only in an embryonic condition. Instead of a well-organized army of
                        the modem type there was merely an undisciplined militia composed almost
                        exclusively of irregular cavalry; and the national defences as a whole were
                        so weak that, in the opinion of such a competent authority as Maurice of
                        Saxony, the country might easily be conquered by a regular army of 48,000
                        men. Here was a tempting field for the application of Catherine’s aggressive
                        policy, and if she had had to deal merely with the Poles she would have had
                        an easy task. Unfortunately for the success of her schemes she had to reckon
                        with stronger states which were anxious to check the Russian advance, and
                        which were determined, in the event of aggression, to have it share of the
                        plunder. Frederick the Great was at that moment impatient to extend and
                        consolidate his kingdom by getting possession of the basin of the lower
                        Vistula, which separated eastern Prussia from the rest of his dominions,
                        while Austria had also claims on Polish territory and would certainly not
                        submit to be excluded by her two rivals. In these circumstances Catherine
                        hesitated to bring matters to a crisis, but her hand was forced by
                        Frederick, and in 1772 the first partition of Poland took place without any
                        very strenuous resistance on the part of the victim. This national disaster
                        opened the eyes of many Polish patriots to the necessity of changing
                        radically the old order of things, and an attempt was made by them to remove
                        some of the more glaring absurdities of the existing constitution: the
                        throne was declared to be hereditary, the <hi rend="italic">liberum
                            veto</hi> by which any petty noble could annul the most important
                        decision of the national assembly was abolished, the royal authority was
                        greatly strengthened, and the towns were empowered to send deputies to the
                        Diet (1791). Such salutary reforms were naturally unwelcome to the
                        aggressive neighbours who wished to preserve the traditional anarchy in
                        order to have new facilities for intervention, and as Russia had signed with
                        the puppet-king in 1768 a treaty by which the constitution could not be
                        modified without her consent, she had a plausible ground for protest. She
                        waited, however, until a deputation of the malcontents, who regretted the
                        loss of <hi rend="italic">liberum veto</hi> and who were afraid that the
                        party of reform might undertake the emancipation of the serfs, came to St
                        Petersburg and asked for support in defence of the ancient liberties. Then
                        an imperial manifesto reminding the Poles of the treaty of 1768 was issued
                        and a large Russian force entered the Ukraine. This led to the second
                        partition (1793), by which Russia obtained the eastern provinces with three
                        millions of inhabitants. Even now the work of spoliation was not complete.
                        When the patriots under Koscziusko made a desperate effort to recover the
                        national independence the struggle produced a third partition (1795), by
                        which the remainder of the kingdom was again divided between Russia, Prussia
                        and Austria. Thus Poland disappeared for a time from the map of Europe.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r05-0902" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0965.jp2"/>
                   <p>. Russia's advance westward raised indirectly the Eastern Question, because
                        it threatened two of France's traditional allies, ■ Sweden and Poland, and
                        Choiseul considered that the best means of checkmating Catherine's
                        aggressive schemes was to incite France's third traditional ally, Turkey, to
                        attack her. This was not a difficult matter, because the Sublime Porte had
                        many things to complain of in the past and had good reason to fear
                        aggression in the near future. War was accordingly declared in 1768, but it
                        proved disastrous for the sultan; and he had to sign in 1774 the treaty of
                        Kuchuk-Kainarji, which gave</p>
                   <p>Russia a firm hold on the Black Sea and the lower Danube (see Turkey: <hi
                            rend="italic">History).</hi> The Tatars of the Bug, of the Crimea and of
                        the Kuban were liberated from the suzerainty of the Porte; Azov, Kinburn and
                        all the fortified places of the Crimea were ceded to Russia; the Bosphorus
                        and Dardanelles were opened to Russian merchant vessels; and Russian
                        ambassadors obtained the right to intervene in favour of the inhabitants of
                        the Danubian principalities. Ten years later the semblance of independence
                        which was left to the khans of the Crimea was destroyed and the peninsula
                        formally annexed to the empire.</p>
                   <p>The peace concluded at Kuchuk-Kainarji was not of long duration. Catherine
                        had conceived an ambitious plan of solving radically the Eastern Question by
                        partitioning Turkey as she and her allies had partitioned Poland, and she
                        had persuaded the emperor Joseph II. to take part in the scheme. It was
                        intended that Russia should take what remained of the northern coast of the
                        Black Sea, Austria should annex the Turkish provinces contiguous to her
                        territory, the Danubian principalities and Bessarabia should be formed into
                        an independent kingdom called Dacia, the Turks should be expelled from
                        Europe, the Byzantine empire should be resuscitated, and the grand-duke
                        Constantine, second son of the Russian heir-apparent, should be placed on
                        the throne of the Palaeologi. Rumours of this gigantic scheme reached
                        Constantinople, and as Catherine’s menacing attitude left little doubt as to
                        her aggressive intentions the Porte presented an ultimatum and finally
                        declared war (1787). Fortune again favoured the Russian arms, but as Austria
                        was less successful and signed a separate peace at Sistova in 1791,
                        Catherine did not obtain much matérial advantage from the campaign. By the
                        peace of Jassy, signed in January 1792, she retained Ochakov and the coast
                        between the Bug and the Dniester, and she secured certain privileges for the
                        Danubian principalities, but the Turks remained in Constantinople, and the
                        realization of the famous Greek project, as it was termed, had to be
                        indefinitely postponed.</p>
                   <p>During the first years of the French Revolution Catherine's sympathy with
                        philosophic liberalism rapidly evaporated, and she did all in her power to
                        stimulate the hostility of the European sovereigns to the democratic
                        movement; but she carefully abstained from joining the Coalition, and waited
                        patiently for the moment when the complications in western Europe would give
                        her an opportunity of solving independently the Eastern Question in
                        accordance with Russian interests. That moment never came. In November 1706,
                        when the country was not yet prepared to énter on a decisive struggle with
                        Turkey, Catherine died at the age of sixty-six, and was succeeded by her son
                        Paul, whom</p>
                   <p>she had kept during her long réign in a state of semi-captivity.</p>
                   <p>The short reign of Paul (1796-1801) resembled in many points the still
                        shorter one of his father, Peter III. Both sovereigns were childishly
                        wayward and capriciously autocratic; both were recklessly indifferent to the
                        feelings, convictions and wishes of those around them; both took a
                        passionate interest in the minutiae of military affairs; as Peter had
                        conceived a boundless admiration for Frederick the Great, so Paul conceived
                        a similar admiration for Napoleon, and both suddenly reversed the national
                        policy to suit this feeling; both were singularly blind to the consequences
                        of their foolish conduct; and both fell victims to court conspiracies which
                        could be in some measure justified, or at least excused, on</p>
                   <p>patriotic grounds.</p>
                   <p>Paul left no deep, permanent mark on Russian history. In internal affairs he
                        wished to undo what his mother had done, but his impulsive, incoherent
                        efforts in that direction merely dislocated the administrative mechanism
                        withput producing any tangible results. In foreign affairs he displayed the
                        same capaciousness and want of perseverance. After proclaiming his intention
                        of conferring on his subjects the blessings of peace, he joined in 1798 an
                        Anglo-Austrian coalition against France; but when Austria paid more
                        attention to her own interests than to the interests of monarchical
                        institutions in general, and when England did not respect the independence
                        of Malta, which he had taken under his protection, he succumbed to the
                        artful blandishments of Napoleon and formed with him a plan for ruining the
                        British empire by the conquest of India. Having roused, by what ought
                        perhaps to be called his insanity, the enmity, distrust and fear of all
                        around him, including some members of his own family, he was assassinated on
                        the night of the 23rd to 24th of March 1801, and was succeeded by his son
                        Alexander I.</p>
                   <p>The early part of Alexander's reign (1801-25) was a period of generous ideas
                        and liberal reforms. Under the influence of his Swiss tutor, Frederick Cesar
                        de Laharpe, he had imbibed many of the democratic ideas of the time, and he
                        aspired to put them in practice, with the assistance at first of three young
                        friends, Novosiltsov, Adam Czartoryski and Strogonov, who were his intimate
                        counsellors and were popularly known as the Triumvirate, and later of
                        Mikhail Speranski (?.r.). Some of the more oppressive measures of the
                        previous reign were abolished; the clergy, the nobles and the merchants were
                        exempted from corporal punishment; the central organs of administration were
                        modernized and the Council of the Empire was created; the idea of granting a
                        constitution was academically discussed; great schemes for educating the
                        people were entertained; parish schools, gymnasia, training colleges and
                        ecclesiastical seminaries were founded; the existing universities of Moscow,
                        Vilna and Dorpat were reorganized and new ones founded in Kazan and Kharkov;
                        the great work of serf-emancipation was begun in the Baltic provinces. In
                        all these schemes Alexander took a keen personal interest; but his
                        enthusiasm was soon cooled by practical difficulties, and his attention
                        became more and more engrossed by foreign affairs.</p>
                   <p>At that time, in respect of foreign affairs, Russia was entering on a new
                        phase of her history. Hitherto she had confined her efforts to territorial
                        expansion in eastern Europe and in Asia, and she had sought foreign
                        alliances merely as temporary expedients to facilitate the attainment of
                        that object. Now she was beginning to consider herself a powerful member of
                        the European family of nations, and she aspired to exercise a predominant
                        influence in all European questions. This tendency was already shown by
                        Catherine when she* created the League of Neutrals as an arm against the
                        naval supremacy of England, and by Paul when he insisted that his peace
                        negotiations with Bonaparte should be regarded as part of a general European
                        pacification, in which he must be consulted. Alexander insisted still more
                        strongly on this claim, and in the convention which he concluded with the
                        First Consul in October 1801 it was agreed that the maintenance of a just
                        equilibrium between Austria and Prussia should be taken as an invariable
                        principle in the plans of both parties, that the integrity of the kingdom of
                        the Two Sicilies should be respected, that the • duke of Württemberg should
                        receive in Germany an indemnity proportionate to his losses, that the
                        dominions of the elector of Bavaria should be preserved intact, and that the
                        independence of the Ionian Islands should not be violated. Having obtained
                        these important concessions the tsar imagined for a moment that in any
                        further territorial changes he would be consulted and his advice allowed due
                        weight, and he seems even to have indulged in the hope that the affairs of
                        Europe might be directed by himself and bis new ally. His illusion was soon
                        dispelled, because the aims and policy of the two potentates were utterly
                        irreconcilable. Whilst</p>

                   <p>the one strove to erect bulwarks against French aggression, the other was
                        preparing the ground for fresh annexations. During 1803-4 the breach between
                        the two rivals widened, because Napoleon became more and more aggressive and
                        unceremonious in Italy and Germany. Before the end of 1803 Alexander had
                        come to perceive the necessity of resisting him energetically in order to
                        save Europe from complete subjection, and in August 1804 he recognized that
                        an armed conflict was inevitable. It broke out in the following year, and
                        after the battles of Austerlitz (December 1805) and Friedland (June 1807),
                        in which the Russians were completely defeated, the two sovereigns had their
                        famous interviews at Tilsit, at which they not only made peace but agreed to
                        divide the world between them, with a sublime indifference to the interests
                        of other states. The grandiose project was at once vaguely outlined in three
                        formal documents, to the intense satisfaction of both parties, and on both
                        sides there was much rejoicing at the conclusion of such an auspicious
                        alliance; but the diplomatic honeymoon was not of long duration. The mutual
                        assurances of unbounded confidence, admiration and sympathy, if there was
                        any genuine sincerity in them, represented merely a transient state of
                        feeling. Napoleon, who could brook no equal, was nourishing the secret hope
                        that his confederate might be used as a docile subordinate in the
                        realization of his own plans, and the confederate soon came to suspect that
                        he was being duped. His suspicions were intensified by the hostile
                        criticisms of the Tilsit arrangement among bis own subjects and by the
                        arbitrary conduct of his ally, who continued his aggressions in reckless
                        fashion as if he were sole master of Europe. The sovereigns of Sardinia,
                        Naples, Portugal and Spain were dethroned, the pope was driven from Rome,
                        the Rhine Confederation was extended till France obtained a footing on the
                        Baltic, the grand-duchy of Warsaw was reorganized and strengthened, the
                        promised evacuation of Prussia was indefinitely postponed, an armistice
                        between Russia and Turkey was negotiated by French diplomacy in such a way
                        that the Russian troops should evacuate the Danubian principalities, which
                        Alexander intended to annex to his empire, and the scheme for breaking up
                        the Ottoman empire and ruining England by the conquest of India, which had
                        been one of the most attractive baits in the Tilsit negotiations, but which
                        had not been formulated in the treaty, was no longer spoken of. At the same
                        time Napoleon threatened openly to crush Austria, and in 1809 he carried out
                        his threat by defeating the Austrian armies at Wagram and elsewhere, and
                        dictating the treaty of Schônbrunn (October 14).</p>
                   <p>Russia now remained the only unconquered power on the continent, and it was
                        evident that the final struggle with her could not be long delayed. It began
                        in 1812 by the advance of the <hi rend="italic">Grande Armée</hi> on Moscow,
                        and it ended in 1815 at Waterloo. During those three years Alexander was the
                        chief antagonist of Napoleon, and it was largely due to his skill and
                        persistency that the allies held together and freed Europe permanently from
                        the Napoleonic domination. When peace was finally concluded, he had obtained
                        that predominant position in European politics which had been the object of
                        his ambition since the commencement of his reign, and he now believed firmly
                        that he had been chosen by Providence to secure the happiness of the world
                        in general and of the European nations in particular. In the fulfilment of
                        this supposed mission be was not very successful, because his conception of
                        national happiness and the means of obtaining it differed widely from that
                        of the peoples whom he wished to benefit. They had fought for freedom in
                        order to liberate themselves not only from the yoke of Napoleon but also
                        from the tyranny of their own governments, whereas he expected them to
                        remain submissively under the patriarchal institutions which their native
                        rulers imposed on them. Thus, in spite of his academic s&gt;m-pathy with
                        liberal ideas, he became, together with Metternich, a champion of political
                        stagnation, and co-operated willingly in the reactionary measures against
                        the revolutionary movements in Germany, Italy and Spain. In the affairs of
                        his own country he refrained from developing and extending the liberal
                        institutions which he had created immediately after his accession, and he
                        finally adopted in all departments of administration a strongly reactionary
                        policy. This naturally caused profound disappointment and dissatisfaction in
                        the liberal section of the educated classes and especially among the young
                        officers of the regiments which had spent some years in western Europe. Some
                        of these officers had been in touch with the revolutionary movements, and
                        had adopted the idea then prevalent in France, Germany and Italy that the
                        best instrument for assuring political progress was to be found in secret
                        societies. In Russia such societies began to be formed about 1816. The tsar,
                        though he came to know of their existence, refrained from taking repressive
                        measures against them, and when he died suddenly at Taganrog on the 1st of
                        December 1825, two of them made an attempt to realize their political
                        aspirations. The heir to the throne was the late tsar’s eldest brother,
                        Constantine, but he declined, for private reasons, to accept the succession,
                        and a few days elapsed before tbe second brother,</p>
                   <p>Nicholas, was proclaimed emperor. Taking advantage of this short
                        interregnum, some members of the secret societies, mostly officers of the
                        Guards, organized a mutiny among the troops quartered in St Petersburg and
                        in Podolia, with a view to effecting a political revolution, but the
                        movement was easily suppressed, and the ringleaders, known subsequently as
                        the Decembrists, were severely punished (see Nicholas I.).</p>
                   <p>Nicholas was a blunt soldier incapable of comprehending his brother’s
                        sentimental sympathy with liberalism. The Decembrists’ abortive attempt at
                        revolution* and the Polish insurrection of 1831, which he crushed with great
                        severity, confirmed.him in his conviction that Russia must be ruled with a
                        strong hand. That conviction he put into practice with extreme rigour during
                        tbe thirty years of his reign (1825-55), endeavouring by every means at his
                        disposal to prevent revolutionary ideas from germinating spontaneously among
                        his subjects and from being imported from abroad. For this purpose he
                        created a very severe press-censorship and an expensive system of passports,
                        which made it more difficult for Russians to visit foreign countries. It
                        would be unjust, however, to say that he was the determined enemy of all
                        progress. Progress was to be made in certain directions and in a certain
                        way. Not only was the army t J be well drilled and the fleet to be carefully
                        equipped, but railways were to be constructed, river-navigation was to be
                        facilitated, manufacturing industry was to be developed, commerce was to be
                        encouraged, the administration was to be improved, the laws were to be
                        codified and the tribunals were to be reorganized. All this was to be done,
                        however, under the strict supervision and guidance of tbe autocratic power,
                        with as little aid as possible from private initiative and with no control
                        whatever of public opinion, because influential public opinion is apt to
                        produce insubordination. When the results proved unsatisfactory, remedies
                        were sought in increased administrative supervision, draconian legislation
                        and severe punishment, and no attempt was made to get out of the vicious
                        circle. In the last months of his life, under the influence of a great
                        national disaster, the conscientious, persistent autocrat began to suspect
                        that his system was a mistake, but he still clung to it obstinately. “ Aly
                        successor,” he is reported to have said on his death-bed, “ may do as he
                        pleases, but I cannot change 1 ”</p>
                   <p>This steadfast faith in autocratic methods and the exaggerated fear of
                        revolutionary principles were shown in foreign as well as in home affairs.
                        Like Alexander in the last period of his reign, Nicholas considered himself
                        tbe supreme guardian of European order, and was ever on the watch to oppose
                        revolution in all its forms. Hence he was generally in strained relations
                        with France, especially in the time of Louis Philippe, who became king not
                        by the grace of God but by the will of the people. During the revolutionary
                        ferment of 1848-49 he urged the Prussian king to refuse the imperial crown,
                        co-operated with the Austrian emperor in suppressing the Hungarian
                        insurrection, and compelled the Prussians to withdraw their support from tbe
                        insurgents</p>
                    <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r05-0904" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0967.jp2"/>
                   <p>in Schleswig-Holstein. Unfortunately for the peace of the world his habitual
                        policy of maintaining the existing state of things was frequently obscured
                        and disturbed by his desire to maintain and increase his own and his
                        country’s prestige, influence and territory. By the Persian War, which broke
                        out in 1826, in consequence of frontier disputes, he annexed the provinces
                        of Erivan and Nakhichevan, and during the whole of his reign the conquest of
                        the Caucasus was systematically carried on. With regard also to the Ottoman
                        empire his policy cannot be said to have been strictly conservative. As
                        protector of the Orthodox Christians he espoused the cause of the rayahs in
                        Greece, Scrvia and Rumania. Under a threat of war he obtained in 1826 the
                        Convention of Akerman, by which the autonomy of Moldavia, Walachia and
                        Servia was confirmed, free passage of the straits was secured for merchant
                        ships and disputed territory on the Asiatic frontier was annexed, and in
                        July 1827 he signed with England and</p>
                   <p>France the treaty of London for the solution of the Greek question by the
                        mediation of the Powers. As the sultan rejected the mediation, his fleet was
                        destroyed by the combined squadrons of the three Powers at Navarino; and as
                        this “ untoward event ” did not suffice to overcome his resistance, a
                        Russian army crossed the Danube and after two hard-fought campaigns advanced
                        to Adrianople. Here, on the 14th of September 1829, was signed a treaty by
                        which the Porte ceded to Russia the islands at the mouth of the Danube and
                        several districts on the Asiatic frontier, granted full liberty to Russian
                        navigation and commerce in the Black Sea, and guaranteed the autonomous
                        rights previously accorded to Moldavia, Walachia and Servia. By the 10th
                        article of the treaty, moreover, Turkey acceded to the protocol of the 22nd
                        of March 1829, by which the Powers had agreed to the erection of Greece into
                        a tributary principality. This attempt of Russia to secure the sole prestige
                        of liberating Greece was, however, frustrated by the action of the other
                        Powers in putting forward the principle of the independence of the new Greek
                        state, with a further extension of frontiers.</p>
                   <p>The result of the war was to make Russia supreme at Constantinople; and
                        before long an opportunity of further increasing her influence was created
                        by Mehemet Ali, the ambitious pasha of Egypt, who in November 1831 began a
                        war with his sovereign in Syria, gained a series of victories over the
                        Turkish forces in Asia Minor and threatened Constantinople. Sultan Madmud
                        II. after appealing in vain to Great Britain for active assistance turned in
                        despair to Russia. Nicholas immediately sent his Black Sea fleet into the
                        Bosphorus, landed on the Asiatic shore a force of 10,000 men, and advanced
                        another large force towards the Turkish frontier in Bessarabia. Under
                        pressure from England and France the Egyptians retreated and the; Russian
                        forces were withdrawn, but the tsar had mean* while (July 8, 1833) concluded
                        with the sultan the treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi, which constituted ostensibly
                        a defensive and offensive alliance between the two Powers and established
                        virtually a Russian protectorate over Turkey. In a secret article of the
                        treaty the sultan undertook in the event of a <hi rend="italic">casus
                            foederis</hi> arising, and in consideration of being relieved of his
                        obligations under the articles of the public treaty, to close the
                        Dardanelles to the warships of all nations “ <hi rend="italic">au
                            besoin”</hi> which meant in effect that in the event of Russia being
                        threatened with an attack from the Mediterranean he would close the
                        Dardanelles against the invader. England and France protested energetically
                        and the treaty remained a dead letter, but the question came up again in
                        1840, after Mahmud’s renewed attempt to crush Mehemet Ali had ended in the
                        utter defeat of the Turks by Ibrahim at Nezib (June 24, 1839). This time
                        Mehemet Ali was supported by the French government, which aimed at
                        establishing predominant influence in Egypt, but he was successfully opposed
                        by a coalition of Great Britain, Russia, Austria and Prussia, which
                        checkmated the aggressive designs of France by the convention of London
                        (July 15, 1840) (see Mehemet Ali and Turkey). In this way the development of
                        Russian policy with regard to Turkey was checked for some years, but the
                        project of confirming and extending the Russian protectorate over the
                        Orthodox Christians was revived in 1852, when Napoleon III. obtained for the
                        Roman Catholics certain privileges with regard to the Holy Places in
                        Palestine. At the same time Austria intervened in Montenegrin affairs and
                        induced the sultan to withdraw his troops from the principality. In these
                        two incidents the tsar perceived a diminution of Russian prestige and
                        influence in Turkey, and Prince Menshikov was sent on a special mission to
                        Constantinople to obtain reparation in the form of a treaty which should
                        guarantee the rights of the Orthodox Church with regard to the Holy Places
                        and confirm the protectorate of Russia over the Orthodox rayahs, established
                        by the treaties of Kainarji, Bucharest and Adrianople. The resistance of the
                        sultan, supported by Great Britain and France, led to the Crimean War, which
                        was terminated by the taking of Sevastopol (September T855) and the treaty
                        of Paris (March 30,1856). By that important document Russia reluctantly
                        consented to a strict limitation of her armaments in the Black Sea, to
                        withdrawal from the mouths of the Danube by the retrocession of Bessarabia
                        which she had annexed in 1812, and finally to a renunciation of all special
                        rights of intervention between the sultan and his Christian subjects.
                        Nicholas did not live to experience this humiliation. He had died at St
                        Petersburg on the 2nd of March 1855 and had been succeeded by his eldest
                        son, Alexander II.</p>
                   <p>The first decade of Alexander’s reign is commonly known in Russia as “ the
                        epoch of the great reforms,” and may be described as a violent reaction
                        against the political and intellectual stagnation of the preceding period.
                        The repressive system of Nicholas, in which all other public interests were
                        sacrificed to that of making Russia a great military power, the guardian of
                        order in Europe and the predominant factor in the Eastern Question, had been
                        tried and found wanting. Ending in a military disaster and a diplomatic
                        humiliation, it had failed to attain even the narrow object for which it had
                        been created. This was clearly perceived and keenly felt by the educated
                        classes, and as soon as the strong hand of the uncompromising autocrat was
                        withdrawn, they clamoured loudly for radical changes in the aims and methods
                        of their rulers. Russia must adopt, it was said, those enlightened
                        principles and liberal institutions which made the Western nations superior
                        to her not only in the-arts of peace but even in the art of war; only by
                        imitating her rivals could she hope to overtake and surpass them in the race
                        of progress. On that subject there was wonderful unanimity, and the few
                        persons who could not join in the chorus had the prudence to remain silent.
                        For the first time in the history of Russia public opinion in the modem
                        sense became a power in the state and influenced strongly the policy of the
                        government. Though the young emperor was of too phlegmatic a temperament to
                        be carried away by the prevailing excitement and of too practical a turn of
                        mind to adopt wholesale the doctrinaire theories of his self-constituted,
                        irresponsible advisers, he recognized that great administrative and economic
                        changes were required, and after a short period of hesitation he entered on
                        a series of drastic reforms, of which the most important were the
                        emancipation of the serfs, the thorough reorganization of the judicial
                        administration and the development of local self-government. All these
                        undertakings, in which the humane, liberal-minded autocrat received the
                        sympathy, support and co-operation of the more enlightened of his subjects,
                        were successfully accomplished. The serfs were liberated entirely from the
                        arbitrary rule of the land-owners and became proprietors of the communal
                        land; the old tribunals which could be justly described as “ dens of
                        iniquity and incompetence,” were replaced by civil and criminal law-courts
                        of the French type, in which justice was dispensed by trained jurists
                        according to codified legislation, and from which the traditional bribery
                        and corruption were rigidly excluded; and the administration of local
                        affairs—roads, schools, hospitals, &amp;c.— was entrusted to provincial
                        and district councils freely elected by all classes of the population. In
                        addition to these great and beneficent changes, means were taken for
                        developing more rapidly the</p>

                   <p>vast natural resources of the country, public instruction received an
                        unprecedented impetus, a considerable amount of liberty was accorded to the
                        press, a strong spirit of liberalism pervaded rapidly all sections of the
                        educated classes, a new imaginative and critical literature dealing with
                        economic, philosophical and political questions sprang into existence, and
                        for a time the young generation fondly imagined that Russia, awakening from
                        her traditional lethargy, was about to overtake, and soon to surpass, on the
                        path of national progress, the older nations of western Europe.</p>
                   <p>These sanguine expectations were not fully realized. The economic and moral
                        condition of the peasantry was little improved by freedom, and in many
                        districts there were signs of positive impoverishment and demoralization.
                        The local self-government institutions after a short period of feverish and
                        not always well-directed activity, showed symptoms of organic exhaustion.
                        The reformed tribunals, though incomparably better than their predecessors,
                        did not give universal satisfaction. In the imperial administration, the
                        corruption and long-established abuses which had momentarily vanished, began
                        to reappear. Industrial enterprises did not always succeed. Education
                        produced many unforeseen and undesirable practical results. The liberty of
                        the press not unfrequently degenerated into licence, and sane liberalism was
                        often replaced by socialistic dreaming. In short, it became only too evident
                        that there was no royal road to national prosperity, and that Russia, like
                        other nations, must be content to advance slowly and laboriously along the
                        rough path of painful experience. In these circumstances sanguine enthusiasm
                        naturally gave way to despondency, and the reforming zeal of the government
                        was replaced by tendencies of a decidedly reactionary kind. Partly from
                        disappointment and nervous exhaustion, and partly from a conviction that the
                        country required rest in order to judge the practical results of the reforms
                        already accomplished, the tsar refrained from further initiating new
                        legislation, and the government gave it to be understood that the epoch of
                        the great reforms was closed.</p>
                   <p>In the younger ranks of the educated classes this state of things produced
                        keen dissatisfaction, which soon found vent in revolutionary agitation. At
                        first the agitation was of an academic character and was dealt with by the
                        press-censure; but it gradually took the form of secret associations, and
                        the police had to interfere.</p>
                   <p>There were no great, well-organized secret societies, but there were many
                        small groups, composed chiefly of male and female students of the
                        universities and technical schools, which worked independently for a common
                        purpose. Finding that the walls of autocracy could not be overturned by
                        blasts of revolutionary trumpets in the periodical press and in
                        clandestinely printed seditious proclamations, the young enthusiasts
                        determined to seek the support of the masses, or, as they termed it, <hi
                            rend="sup">u</hi> to go in among the people <hi rend="italic">” (idti v
                            nardd).</hi> Under the disguise of doctors, mid wives, school teachers,
                        governesses, factory hands or common labourers, they sought to make
                        proselytes among the peasantry and the workmen in the industrial centres by
                        revolutionary pamphlets and oral explanations. For a time the propaganda had
                        very little success, because the uneducated peasants and factory workers
                        could not understand the phraseology and abstract principles of socialism;
                        but when the propagandists descended to a lower platform and spread rumours
                        that the tsar had given all the land to the peasants, and was prevented by
                        the proprietors and officials from carrying out his benevolent intentions,
                        there was a serious danger of agrarian disorders, and energetic measures
                        were adopted by the authorities. Wholesale arrests were made by the police,
                        and many of the accused were imprisoned or exiled to distant provinces, some
                        by the regular tribunals, and others by so-called “ administrative procedure
                        ” without a formal trial. The activity of the police and the sufferings of
                        the victims naturally produced intense excitement and bitterness among those
                        who escaped arrest, and a secret organization calling itself the Executive
                        Committee announced in its clandestinely printed organs that the
                        functionaries who distinguished themselves in the suppression of the
                        propaganda would be “ removed.” A number of prominent officials were
                        accordingly condemned to death by this secret terrorist tribunal, and in
                        some cases the sentences were carried out. General Mezentsov, the head of
                        the political police, was assassinated in broad daylight in one of the
                        principal streets of St Petersburg, and in the provinces a good many
                        officials of various grades shared the same fate. As these acts of terrorism
                        had quite the opposite of the desired effect, repeated attempts were made on
                        the life of the emperor, and at last the carefully laid plans of the
                        conspirators were successful. On the 13th of March 1881, when returning from
                        a military parade to the Winter Palace, Alexander II. was terribly wounded
                        by the explosion of a bomb, and died shortly afterwards. (For details of
                        this revolutionary movement, see Nihilism.)</p>
                   <p>In respect of foreign policy the reign of Alexander II. differed widely from
                        that of Nicholas. The Eastern Colossus no longer inspired respect and fear
                        in Europe. Until the country had completely recovered from the exhaustion of
                        the Crimean War the government remained in the background of European
                        polities. Its attitude was graphically described in the famous declaration
                        of Prince Gorchakov: “ La Russie ne boude pas; elle se recueille.” On one
                        point, however, this description was not accurate; Russia sulked so far as
                        Austria was concerned, for she could not forget that the emperor Francis
                        Joseph, by his wavering and unfriendly conduct towards her during the
                        Crimean War, had ill repaid her assistance to the Habsburg Monarchy in 1849,
                        and had fulfilled the cynical prediction of Prince Schwarzenberg that his
                        country would astonish the world by her ingratitude. It was not without
                        secret satisfaction, therefore, that Prince Gorchakov watched the repeated
                        defeats of the Austrian army in the Italian campaign of 1859, and he felt
                        inclined to respond to the advances made to him by Napoleon III.; but the
                        germs of a Russo-French alliance, which had come into existence immediately
                        after the Crimean War, ripened very slowly, and they were completely
                        destroyed in 1863 when the French emperor wounded Russian sensibilities
                        deeply by giving moral and diplomatic support to the Polish insurrection. On
                        that occasion Bismarck helped Gorchakov to ward off the threatened
                        intervention of France and England, and he thereby founded the cordial
                        relations which subsisted between the cabinets of Berlin and St Petersburg
                        down to 1878, and which contributed powerfully to the creation of the German
                        empire by defending the Prussian cabinet against the jealousy and enmity of
                        Austria and France. In return for these services Bismarck helped Russia to
                        recover a portion of what she had lost by the Crimean War, for it was thanks
                        to his connivance and diplomatic support that she was able in 1871 to
                        denounce with impunity the clauses of the treaty of Paris which limited
                        Russian armament in the Black Sea. Had the tsar been satisfied with this
                        important success, which enabled him to rebuild Sevastopol and construct a
                        Black Sea fleet, his reign might have been a peaceful and prosperous one,
                        but he tried to recover the remainder of what had been lost by the Crimean
                        War, the province of Bessarabia and predominant influence in Turkey.</p>
                   <p>To effect this, he embarked on the Turkish War of 1877-78, which ’ended in
                        disappointment Though the campaign enabled him to recover Bessarabia at the
                        expense of his Rumanian ally, it did not increase Russian prestige in the
                        East, because the Russian army was repeatedly repulsed by the Turks, and
                        when at last it reached Constantinople, it was prevented from entering the
                        city by the threatening attitude of England and Austria. In the field of
                        diplomacy there was likewise disappointment. The concessions extorted from
                        the Porte in the preliminary treaty of San Stefano (March 3, 1878) were
                        revived and considerably modified in favour of Turkey by the congress of
                        Berlin (June 13-July 13,1878); see Europe: <hi rend="italic">history.</hi>

                   <p>Much greater success attended the efforts of Russian diplomacy and Russian
                        arms in Asia. By the treaty of Aigun (May 28, 1858), and without any
                        military operations, the cession of a great part of the basin of the Amur
                        was obtained from China. Six years later began the rapid expansion of Russia
                        in Central Asia, and at the end</p>

                   <p>of Alexander II.’s reign her domination had been firmly established
                        throughout nearly the whole of the vast expanse of territory lying between
                        Siberia on the north and Persia and Afghanistan on the south, and stretching
                        without interruption from the eastern coast of the Caspian to the Chinese
                        frontier. The greater part of the territory was formally incorporated into
                        the empire, and the petty potentates, such as the khan of Khiva and the amir
                        of Bokhara, who were allowed to retain a semblance of their former
                        sovereignty, became obsequious vassals of the White Tsar.</p>
                   <p>The assassination of Alexander II. by the terrorists made a profound
                        impression on his son and successor, and determined the general character of
                        his rule. Alexander III. (1881-94), who had never sympathized with
                        liberalism in any form, entered frankly on a reactionary policy, which was
                        pursued consistently during the whole of his reign. He could not, of course,
                        undo the great reforms of his* predecessor, but he amended them in such a
                        way as to counteract what he considered the exaggerations of liberalism.
                        Local self-government in the village communes, the rural districts and the
                        towns was carefully restricted, and placed to a greater extent under the
                        control of the regular officials. The reformers of the previous reign had
                        endeavoured to make the emancipated peasantry administratively and
                        economically independent of the landed proprietors; the conservatives of
                        this later era, proceeding on the assumption that the peasants did not know
                        how to make a proper use of the liberty prematurely conferred upon them,
                        endeavoured to re-establish the influence of the landed proprietors by
                        appointing from amongst them “ land-chiefs,” who were to exercise over the
                        peasants of their district a certain amount of patriarchal jurisdiction. The
                        reformers of the previous reign had sought to make the new local
                        administration <hi rend="italic">(zemstvo)</hi> a system of genuine rural
                        self-government and a basis for future parliamentary institutions; these
                        later conservatives transformed it into a mere branch of the ordinary state
                        administration, and took precautions against its ever assuming a political
                        character. Even municipal institutions, which had never shown much vitality,
                        were subjected to similar restrictions. In short, the various forms of local
                        self-government, which were intended to raise the nation gradually to the
                        higher political level of western Europe, were condemned as unsuited to the
                        national character and traditions, and as productive of disorder and
                        demoralization. They were accordingly replaced in great measure by the old
                        autocratic methods of administration, and much of the administrative
                        corruption which had been cured, or at least repressed, by the reform
                        enthusiasm again flourished</p>
                   <p>luxuriantly.</p>
                   <p>In a small but influential section of the educated classes there was a
                        conviction that the revolutionary tendencies, which culminated in Nihilism
                        and Anarchism, proceeded from the adoption of cosmopolitan rather than
                        national principles in all spheres of educational and administrative
                        activity, and that the best remedy for the evils from which the country was
                        suffering was to be found in a return to the three great principles of
                        Nationality, Orthodoxy and Autocracy. This doctrine, which had been invented
                        by the Slavophils of a previous generation, was early instilled into the
                        mind of Alexander III. by Pobê-donostsev <hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> who
                        was one of his teachers, and later his most trusted adviser, and its
                        influence can be traced in all the more important acts of the government
                        during that monarch’s reign. His determination to maintain autocracy was
                        officially proclaimed a few days after his accession. Nationality and
                        Eastern Orthodoxy, which are so closely connected as to be almost blended
                        together in the Russian mind, received not less attention. Even in European
                        Russia the regions near the frontier contain a great variety of
                        nationalities, languages and religions. In Finland the population is
                        composed of Finnish-speaking and Swedish-speaking Protestants; the Baltic
                        provinces are inhabited by German-speaking, Lei t-speaking and Esth-speaking
                        Lutherans; the inhabitants of the south-western provinces are chiefly
                        Polish-speaking Roman</p>
                   <p>Catholics and Yiddish-speaking Jews; in the Crimea and on the Middle Volga
                        there are a considerable number of Tatar-speaking Mahommedans; and in the
                        Caucasus there is a conglomeration of races and languages such as is to be
                        found on no other portion of the earth’s surface. Until recent times these
                        various nationalities were allowed to retain unmolested the language,
                        religion and peculiar local administration of their ancestors; but when the
                        new nationality doctrine came into fashion, attempts were made to spread
                        among them the language, religion and administrative institutions of the
                        dominant race. In the reigns of Nicholas I. and Alexander II. these attempts
                        were merely occasional and intermittent; under Alexander III. they were made
                        systematically and with very little consideration for the feelings, wishes
                        and interests of the people concerned. The local institutions were
                        assimilated to those of the purely Russian provinces; the use of the Russian
                        language was made obligatory in the administration, in the tribunals and to
                        some extent in the schools; the spread of Eastern Orthodoxy was encouraged
                        by the authorities, whilst the other confessions were placed under severe
                        restrictions; foreigners were prohibited from possessing landed property;
                        and in some provinces administrative measures were taken for making the land
                        pass into the hands of Orthodox Russians. In this process some of the local
                        officials displayed probably an amount of zeal beyond the intentions of the
                        government, but any attempt to oppose the movement was rigorously punished.
                        Of all the various races the Jews .were the most severely treated. The great
                        majority of them had long been confined to the western and south-western
                        provinces. In the rest of the country they had not been allowed to reside in
                        the villages, because their habits of keeping vodka-shops and lending money
                        at usurious interest were found to demoralize the peasantry, and even in the
                        towns their numbers and occupations had been restricted by the authorities.
                        But, partly from the usual laxity of the administration and partly from the
                        readiness of the Jews to conciliate the needy officials, the rules had been
                        by no means strictly applied. As soon as this fact became known to Alexander
                        III. he ordered the rules to be strictly carried out, without considering
                        what an enormous amount of hardship and suffering such an order entailed. He
                        also caused new rules to be enacted by which his Jewish subjects were
                        heavily handicapped in education and professional advancement. In short,
                        complete Russification of all non-Russian populations and institutions was
                        the chief aim of the government in home affairs.</p>
                   <p>In the foreign policy of the empire Alexander III. likewise introduced
                        considerable changes. During his father’s reign its main objects were: in
                        the west, the maintenance of the alliance with Germany; in south-eastern
                        Europe, the recovery of what had been lost by the Crimean War, the gradual
                        weakening of the Sultan’s authority, and the increase of Russian influence
                        among the minor Slav nationalities; in Asia, the gradual but cautious
                        expansion of Russian domination. In the reign of Alexander III. the first of
                        these objects was abandoned. Already, before his accession, the bonds of
                        friendship which united Russia to Germany had been weakened by the action of
                        Bismarck in giving to the cabinet of St Petersburg at the Berlin congress
                        less diplomatic support than was expected, and by the Austro-German treaty
                        of alliance (October 1879), concluded avowedly for the purpose of opposing
                        Russian aggression; but the old relations were partly reestablished by
                        secret negotiations in 1880, by a meeting of the young tsar and the old
                        emperor at Danzig in 1881, and by the meeting of the three emperors at
                        Skierniewice in 1884, by which the Three Emperors’ League was reconstituted
                        for a term of three years (see ^Europe: <hi rend="italic">History).</hi>
                        Gradually, however, a great change took place in the tsar’s views with
                        regard to the German alliance. He suspected Bismarck of harbouring hostile
                        designs against Russia, and he came to recognize that the permanent
                        weakening of France was not in accordance with Russian political interests.
                        He determined, therefore, to oppose any further disturbance of the balance
                        of power in favour</p>
                    <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r05-0907" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0970.jp2"/>
                   <p>of Germany, and when the treaty of Skierniewice expired in 1887 he declined
                        to renew it. From that time Russia gravitated slowly towards an alliance
                        with France, and sought to create a counterpoise against the Triple Alliance
                        of Germany, Austria and Italy. The tsar was reluctant to bind himself by a
                        formal treaty, because the French government did not offer the requisite
                        guarantees of stability, and because he feared that it might be induced, by
                        the prospect of Russian support, to assume an aggressive attitude towards
                        Germany. He recognized, however, that in the event of a great European war
                        the two nations would in all probability be found fighting on the same side,
                        and that if they made no preparations for concerted military action they
                        would be placed at a grave disadvantage in comparison with their opponents
                        of the Triple Alliance, who were believed to have already worked out an
                        elaborate plan of campaign. In view of this contingency the Russian and
                        French military authorities studied the military questions in common, and
                        the result of their labours was the preparation of a military convention,
                        which was finally ratified in 1894. During this period the relations between
                        the two governments and the two countries became much more cordial. In the
                        summer of 1891 the visit to Kronstadt of a French squadron under Admiral
                        Gervais was made the occasion for an enthusiastic demonstration in favour of
                        a Franco-Russian alliance; and two years later (October 1893) a still more
                        enthusiastic reception was given to the Russian Admiral Avclan and his
                        officers when they visited Toulon and Paris. But it was not till after the
                        death of Alexander III. that the word “ alliance ” was used publicly by
                        official personages. In 1895 the term was first publicly employed by M.
                        Ribot, then president of the council, in the Chamber of Deputies, but the
                        expressions he used were so vague that they did not entirely remove the
                        prevailing doubts as to the existence of a formal treaty. Two years later
                        (August 1897), during the official visit of M. Félix Faure to St Petersburg,
                        a little more light was thrown on the subject. In the complimentary speeches
                        delivered by the president of the French Republic and the tsar, France and
                        Russia were referred to as allies, and the term “ nations alliées ” was
                        afterwards repeatedly used on occasions of a similar kind.</p>
                   <p>In south-eastern Europe Alexander III. adopted an attitude of reserve and
                        expectancy. He greatly increased and strengthened his Black Sea fleet, so as
                        to be ready for any emergency that might arise, and in June 1886, contrary
                        to the declaration made in the Treaty of Berlin (Art. 59), he ordered Batum
                        to be transformed into a fortified naval port, but in the Balkan Peninsula
                        he persistently refrained, under a good deal of provocation, from any
                        inteivention that might lead to a European war. The Bulgarian government,
                        first under Prince Alexander and afterwards under the direction of M.
                        Stamboloff, pursued systematically an anti-Russian policy, but the cabinet
                        of St Petersburg confined itself officially to breaking off diplomatic
                        relations and making diplomatic protests, and unofficially to giving tacit
                        encouragement to revolutionary agitation.</p>
                   <p>In Asia, during the reign of Alexander III. the expansion of Russian
                        domination made considerable progress. A few weeks after his accession he
                        sanctioned the annexation of the territory of the Tekke Turkomans, which had
                        been conquered by General Skobelev, and in 1884 he formally annexed the Merv
                        oasis without military operations. He then allowed the military authorities
                        to push forward in the direction of Afghanistan, until in March 1885 an
                        engagement took place between Russian and Afghan forces at Panjdeh.
                        Thereupon the British government, which had been for some time carrying on
                        negotiations with the cabinet of St Petersburg for a delimitation of the
                        Russo-Afghan frontier, intervened energetically and prepared for war; but a
                        compromise was effected, and after more than two years of negotiation a
                        delimitation convention was signed at St Petersburg on 20th July 1887. The
                        forward movement of Russia was thus stopped in the direction of Herat, but
                        it continued with great activity farther east in the region of the Pamirs,
                        until another Anglo-Russian convention was signed in 1895. During the whole
                        reign of Alexander III. the increase of territory in Central Asia is
                        calculated by Russian authorities at 429,895 square kilometres.</p>
                   <p>On ist November 1894 Alexander III. died, and was succeeded by his son,
                        Nicholas II., who, partly from similarity of character and partly from
                        veneration for his father’s memory, continued the existing lines of policy
                        in home and foreign affairs. The expectation entertained in many quarters
                        that great legislative changes would at once be made in a liberal sense was
                        not realized. When an influential deputation from the province of Tver,
                        which had long enjoyed a reputation for liberalism, ventured to hint in a
                        loyal address that the time had come for changes in the existing autocratic
                        regime, they received a reply which showed that the emperor had no intention
                        of making any such changes. Private suggestions in the same sense, offered
                        directly and respectfully, were no better received, and no important changes
                        were made in the legislation of the preceding reign. But a great alteration
                        took place noiselessly in the manner of carrying out the laws and
                        ministerial circulars. Though resembling his father in the main points of
                        his character, the young tsar was of a more humane disposition^ and he was
                        much less of a doctrinaire. With his father’s aspiration of making Holy
                        Russia a homogeneous empire he thoroughly sympathized in principle, but he
                        disliked the systematic persecution of Jews, heretics and schismatics to
                        which it gave rise, and he let it be understood, without any formal order or
                        proclamation, that the severe measures hitherto employed would not meet with
                        his approval. The officials were not slow to take the hint, and their undue
                        zeal at once disappeared. Nicholas II. showed, however, that his father’s
                        policy of Russification was neither to be reversed nor to be abandoned. When
                        an influential deputation was sent from Finland to St Petersburg to
                        represent to him respectfully that the officials were infringing the local
                        rights and privileges solemnly accorded at the time of the annexation, it
                        was refused an audience, and the leaders of the movement were informed
                        indirectly that local interests must be subordinated to the general welfare
                        of the empire. In accordance with this declaration, the policy of
                        Russification in Finland was steadily maintained, and caused much
                        disappointment, not only to the Finlanders, but also to the other
                        nationalities who desired the preservation of their ancient rights.</p>
                   <p>In foreign affairs Nicholas II. likewise continued the policy of his
                        predecessor, with certain modifications suggested by the change of
                        circumstances. He strengthened the cordial understanding with France by a
                        formal agreement, the terms of which were not divulged, but he never
                        encouraged the French government in any aggressive designs, and he
                        maintained friendly relations with Germany. In the Balkan Peninsula a slight
                        change of attitude took place. Alexander III., indignant at what he
                        considered the ingratitude of the Slav nationalities, remained coldly aloof,
                        as far as possible, from all intervention in their affairs. About three
                        months after his death, de Giers, who thoroughly approved of this attitude,
                        died (26th January 1895), and his successor, Prince Lobanov, minister of
                        foreign affairs from 19th March 1895 to 30th August 1896, endeavoured to
                        recover what he considered Russia’s legitimate influence in the Slav world.
                        For this purpose Russian diplomacy became more active in south-eastern
                        Europe. The result was perceived first in Montenegro and Servia, and then in
                        Bulgaria. Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria had long been anxious to legalize his
                        position by a reconciliation, and as soon as he got rid of Stamboloff he
                        made advances to the Russian government. They were well received, and a
                        reconciliation was effected on certain conditions, the first of which was
                        that Prince Ferdinand’s eldest son and heir should become a member of the
                        Eastern Orthodox Church. As another means of opposing Western influence in
                        south-eastern Europe, Prince Lobanov inclined to the policy of protecting
                        rather than weakening the Ottoman empire. When the British government seemed
                        disposed to use coercive measures for the protection of the Armenians, he
                        gave it clearly to be understood that any such proceeding would be opposed
                        by Russia. After Prince Lobanov’s death and the appointment</p>

                   <p>of Count Muraviev as his successor in January 1897, this tendency of Russian
                        policy became less marked. In April 1897, it is true, when the Greeks
                        provoked a war with Turkey, they received no support from St Petersburg, but
                        at the close of the war the tsar showed himself more friendly to them; and
                        afterwards, when it proved extremely difficult to find a suitable person as
                        governor-general of Crete (see Crete), he recommended the appointment of his
                        cousin, Prince George of Greece —a selection which was pretty sure to
                        accelerate the union of the island with the Hellenic kingdom. How far the
                        recommendation was due to personal feeling, as opposed to political
                        considerations, it is impossible to say.</p>
                   <p>In Asia, after the accession of Nicholas II., the expansion of Russia,
                        following the line of least resistance and stimulated by the construction of
                        the Trans-Siberian railway, took the direction of northern China and the
                        effete little kingdom of Korea. A great part of the eastern section of the
                        railway was constructed on Chinese territory, and elaborate preparations
                        were made for bringing Manchuria within the sphere of Russian influence.
                        With this view, the cabinet of St Petersburg, at the close of the
                        Chino-Japanese War in 1895, objected to all annexations by Japan in that
                        quarter, and insisted on having the treaty of Shimonoseki modified
                        accordingly. Subsequently, by obtaining from the Tsungli-Yaman a long lease
                        of Port Arthur and Talienwan and a concession to unite those ports with the
                        Trans-Siberian by a branch line, she tightened her hold on that portion of
                        the Chinese empire and prepared to complete the work of aggression by
                        so-called “ spontaneous infiltration.” From Manchuria, it was assumed, the
                        political influence and spontaneous infiltration would naturally spread to
                        Korea, and on the deeply indented coast of the Hermit Kingdom might be
                        constructed new ports and arsenals more spacious and strategically more
                        important than Port Arthur.</p>
                   <p>This grandiose project was unexpectedly destroyed by the energetic
                        resistance of Japan, who had ear-marked the Hermit Kingdom for herself, and
                        who declared plainly that she would never tolerate the exclusive influence
                        of Russia in Manchuria. In vain the Russian diplomatists sought to overcome
                        her opposition by dilatory negotiations, in the firm conviction that a small
                        island kingdom in the Pacific would never have the audacity to attack a
                        power which had conquered and absorbed the whole of Northern Asia. Their
                        calculations proved erroneous. Convinced that the onward march of the
                        Colossus could not be permanently arrested by mere diplomatic conventions,
                        the cabinet of Tok io suddenly broke off diplomatic relations and commenced
                        hostilities (February 8, 1904). For Russia the war proved a series of
                        uninterrupted reverses both on land and on sea, until it was terminated by
                        the treaty of Portsmouth in October 1905 (see Russo-Japanese War).</p>
                   <p>What contributed powerfully to the conclusion of peace was the fact that the
                        Russian government was hampered by internal troubles. The old Liberal
                        movement and the terrorist organizations which had been suppressed by
                        Alexander III. were being resuscitated, and the liberal and revolutionary
                        leaders, taking advantage of the unpopularity of the war, were agitating for
                        the convocation of a Constituent Assembly, which should replace the hated
                        bureaucratic régime by democratic institutions. With great reluctance the
                        tsar consented to convoke a consultative chamber of deputies as a sop to
                        public opinion, but that concession stimulated rather than calmed public
                        opinion, and shortly after the conclusion of peace the Liberals and the
                        Revolutionaries, combining their forces, brought about a general strike in
                        St Petersburg together with the stoppage of railway communication all over
                        the empire. Panic-stricken for a moment, the government issued a manifesto
                        proclaiming Liberal principles and promising in vague language all manner of
                        political reforms (October 30, 1905), and when the inordinate expectations
                        created by this extraordinary document were not at once realized,
                        preparations were made for overthrowing the existing regime by means of an
                        armed insurrection. Many believed that the end of autocracy had come, and an
                        extemporized Council of Labour Deputies, anxious to play the part of a <hi
                            rend="italic">Comité de Salut Public</hi> , was ready to take over the
                        supreme power and exercise it in the interests of the proletariat. In
                        reality the revolutionary movement was not so strong and the government not
                        so weak as was generally supposed. Mutinies occurred, it is true, during the
                        next few weeks in Kronstadt and Sevastopol, and in December there was
                        streetfighting for several days in Moscow, but such serious disorders were
                        speedily suppressed, and thereafter the revolutionary manifestations were
                        confined to mass meetings, processions with red flags, attempts on the lives
                        of officials and policemen, robberies under arms and agrarian disturbances.</p>
                   <p>Notwithstanding the unsatisfactory results of the October manifesto the tsar
                        kept his promise of convoking a legislative assembly, and on the 10th of May
                        1906 the first Duma was opened by his majesty in person; but it was so
                        systematically and violently hostile to the government and so determined to
                        obtain executive, in addition to its legislative, functions, that it was
                        dissolved on the 23rd of July without any legislative work being
                        accomplished. The second Duma, which met on the 5th of March 1907, avoided
                        some of the mistakes of its predecessor, but as a legislative assembly it
                        showed itself equally incompetent, and a large section of its members were
                        implicated in a well-organized attempt to spread sedition in the army by
                        revolutionary propaganda. It was dissolved, therefore, on the 16th of June
                        1907, and the electoral law which had given such unsatisfactory results was
                        modified by imperial ukase.</p>
                   <p>The third Duma was subsequently convoked for the 14th of November 1907. (D.

                        of 1910 the Russian revolution, which seemed at one time to promise an
                        overturn as complete as that of the <hi rend="italic">ancien régime</hi> in
                        France, would seem to have entered on a path of orderly and conservative
                        development, and it is possible, now that the smoke of combat has cleared
                        away, to form some estimate of the forces through the interplay of which
                        this result has been achieved. At the outset the superficial resemblance
                        between the revolutionary movement in Russia and that of 1789 in France was
                        striking: there was the same breakdown of the traditional machinery of
                        government, the same general outcry for control by a representative national
                        assembly, the same gradual and reluctant concessions wrung from the crown
                        under pressure of disaffection in the army, popular <hi rend="italic"
                            >émeutes,</hi> the assassination of unpopular officials, and the burning
                        of country houses by organized bands of peasants. Similar, too, was the
                        revelation, when freedom of speech was at last allowed, of the unhappy
                        effect of the long divorce of the intellect of the country from any
                        experience of practical politics. But here the analogy breaks down. France
                        in 1789, though its ancient provincial boundaries survived, had long since
                        been welded into a nation conscious of its common interests; Russia remains
                        a vast empire, composed of the most heterogeneous, sometimes even mutually
                        hostile, elements, whose antagonisms were bound to be an element of weakness
                        in any assembly truly representative of all sections of the people. In
                        France the Revolution had been the work of the middle classes; in Russia an
                        indigenous middle class has, comparatively speaking, no existence, the
                        peasants forming the overwhelming majority of the population. <note

                            and Germans. The peasants numbered 75 %. </note> The supreme peril to
                        the autocracy in Russia lay in the genuine grievances of the peasants, less
                        political than economic, which had opened their minds to revolutionary
                        propaganda. These grievances once removed, and their legitimate land-hunger
                        satisfied, the peasants would become a bulwark of the established order,
                        whatever that might be, as had happened in similar circumstances in Austria
                        in 1849. As for the revolutionary “ intellectuals,” without the lever of

                        subordinated reason to sentiment, until— their impracticable temper having
                        been advertised to all the world—it became easy for the government to treat
                        them as a mere excrescence on the national life, a malignant growth to be
                        removed by a necessary operation. In 1909 the number of exiles for political
                        reasons from Russia was reckoned at 180,000; but the third Duma, purged and
                        packed by an ingenious franchise system, was in its third year passing
                        measures of beneficent legislation, in complete harmony with the government.
                        It is proposed to trace briefly the steps by which this result was obtained.</p>
                   <p>In order to explain the course of the revolution which came to a head in
                        1905 it is necessary to say a few words about constitutional plans and
                        Eberal experiments, initiated from above, which had preceded it. Of the

                        unnecessary here to say much, though Nicholas II. was pressed by the more

                        In 1864, however, the emperor Alexander II. carried the scheme a step
                        further by the creation of elected provincial assemblies <hi rend="italic"

                        debate naturally stimulated the movement in favour of constitutional
                        government, which received new impulses from the sympathetic attitude of the
                        emperor Alexander II., his grant in 1879 of a constitution to the liberated
                        principality of Bulgaria, and the multiplication of Nihilist outrages which
                        pointed to the necessity of conciliating Liberal opinion in order to present
                        a united front against revolutionary agitation. In January 1881 Count
                        Loris-Melikov, minister of the interior, proposed to convene a “ general
                        commission ” to examine legislative proposals before these were laid before
                        the Imperial Council; this commission was to consist of members elected by
                        the <hi rend="italic">zemstvos</hi> and the larger towns, and others
                        nominated in the provinces having no <hi rend="italic">zemstvos.</hi> The
                        plan was approved by Alexander II. on the very morning of his assassination
                        (February 17th, 1881), but it was never promulgated. The new tsar, Alexander
                        III., was an apt pupil of his tutor Pobedonostsev <hi rend="italic"
                            >(q.v.),</hi> the' celebrated procurator of the Holy Synod, for whom the
                        representative system was “ a modern lie,” and his reign covered a period of
                        frank reaction, during which there was not only no question of granting any
                        fresh liberties but those already conceded <hi rend="italic">(e.g.</hi> the
                        principle of the separation of the administrative and judicial functions)
                        were largely curtailed. The result of this policy of repression, associated
                        as it was with gross incompetence and corruption in the organs of the
                        administration, was the rapid spread of the revolutionary movement, which
                        gradually permeated the intelligent classes and ultimately affected even the
                        stolid and apparently immovable masses of the peasantry.</p>
                   <p>The movement came to a head, as a result of the disasters of the war with
                        Japan, in 1904. The assassination of the minister of the interior Plchve, on
                        the 14th of July, by the revolutionist Sazonov was remarkable as a symptom
                        mainly owing to the widespread sympathy of the European press of all shades
                        of opinion with the motives of the assassin. It was clear that the system
                        with which the murdered minister’s name had been associated stood all but
                        universally condemned, and in the appointment of the conciliatory Prince
                        Sviatopolk-Mirski as his successor the tsar himself seemed to concede the
                        necessity for a change of policy. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        with the tacit consent of the police, a private assembly of eminent members
                        of local <hi rend="italic">zemstvos</hi> and municipal <hi rend="italic"
                            >dumas</hi> was held in St Petersburg to discuss the situation. The
                        majority of this decided to approach the crown with a suggestion for a
                        reform of the Russian system on the basis of a national representative
                        assembly, an extension of local self-government, and wider guarantees for
                        individual liberty. The day on which the deputation laid these views before
                        Prince Mirski was hailed by public opinion as recalling the 5th of May 1789,
                        the date of the meeting of the French states-general at Versailles. The
                        emperor, however, whatever his own views, was surrounded by reactionary
                        influences, of which the most powerful were the empress-mother,
                        Pobedonostsev the procurator of the Holy Synod, Count Muraviev and the
                        Grand-duke Sergius. The imperial <hi rend="italic">ukaz of</hi> the 12th of

                        was no word in it of constitutional government. Petitions continued to flow
                        in to the emperor’s cabinet, praying for a national representation, from the
                            <hi rend="italic">zemstvos,</hi> from the nobles and from the
                        professional classes, and their moral was enforced by general agitation, by
                        partial strikes, and by outrages which culminated at Moscow in the murder of
                        the Grand-duke Sergius (February 4th, 1905). In the imperial counsels the
                        resisting forces still seemed to have the upper hand. Prince Mirski
                        resigned, his resignation being immediately followed by a reactionary
                        imperial manifesto reaffirming the principle of autocracy (February 18th).
                        Bulygin, Mirski’s successor, had no knowledge of this until after its
                        publication; he hastened to the tsar and obtained the issue on the same day
                        of a rescript which, while reserving the “ fundamental laws of the empire ”
                        inviolate, stated the emperor’s Intention of summoning the representatives
                        of the people to aid in “ the preparation and examination of legislative
                        proposals.” A commission of inquiry, under the emperor’s presidency, was now
                        established tb elaborate the means for carrying this promise into effect. On
                        the 6th of June, in reply to a deputation of the second congress of <hi
                            rend="italic">zemstvos</hi> headed by Prince Trubetzkoi, the emperor
                        promised the speedy convocation of a National Assembly. When, however, on
                        the 6th of August, the new law was promulgated, it was found that the <hi

                        examination of legislative proposals before these came before the Imperial
                        Council, the duty and right of passing them into law being still reserved
                        for the autocrat alone. The members of the Duma, moreover, were placed at
                        the mercy of the government by a clause empowering the Directing Senate to
                        suspend or deprive them.) The promulgation of this truncated constitution
                        was greeted by a furious agitation, culminating in September in a general
                        strike, rightly described as the most remarkable political phenomenon of
                        modem times. For days the whole mechanism of civilized existence in Russia
                        was at a standstill, all intercourse</p>

                   <p>with the outside world cut off; until at last the government was forced to
                        yield, and on the i7/30th of October 1905 the tsar issued the famous
                        manifesto promising to Russia a constitution based on the main principles of
                        modern Liberalism: national representation, freedom of conscience and
                        opinion, guarantees for individual liberty.</p>
                   <p>The enormous programme of constitutional reform foreshadowed in the
                        manifesto had to be elaborated in haste by Count Witte, the minister of the
                        interior, under circumstances by no means promising. The organs of
                        government seemed paralysed by the repudiation of the principle on which
                        their authority was based, and the empire to be in danger of falling into
                        complete anarchy. The revolutionary terrorists took advantage of the
                        situation to multiply outrages; popular agitation was fomented by a
                        multitude of new journals preaching every kind of extravagant doctrine, now
                        that the censor no longer dared to act; in December the trouble culminated
                        in a formidable rising in Moscow. The revolutionary terrorists were
                        countered by the terrorists of the reaction who, under the name of “ the
                        Union of the Russian People,’* began an organized extermination of the
                        elements supposed to be hostile to the traditional regime. The “ black band
                        ” <hi rend="italic">(chernaya sotnia),</hi> or “ black hundreds,” as they
                        were branded by public opinion, directed their attacks especially against

                   <p>Meanwhile the political parties which were to divide the new Duma had taken
                        shape. Apart from the extremists on one side or the other, frank
                        reactionaries on the Right and Socialists on the Left, two main divisions of
                        opinion revealed themselves in the congresses of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >zemstvos</hi> that met at Moscow in September and</p>
                   <p>November. In the former there had been a fusion between the Radicals,
                        supporters of the autonomy of Poland and a federal constitution for the
                        empire, and the Independence party <hi rend="italic">(Osvobozkdenya)</hi>
                        formed by political exiles at Paris in 1903, the fusion taking the name of
                        Constitutional Democrats, known (from a word-play on the initials K.D.) as “
                        Cadets.” The more moderate elements found a rallying cry in the manifesto of
                        October, took the name of “ the Party of 17 October,” and became known as “
                        Octobrists.” In the <hi rend="italic">zemstvo</hi> congress of November the
                        “ Cadets ” protested against the “ grant ” of a constitution already
                        elaborated, and demanded the convocation of a Constituent Assembly. The
                        Octobrists, on the other hand, supported Count Witte’s moderate programme,
                        the most important provisions of which were the extension (n December 1905)
                        of the suffrage under the stillborn constitution of August, and (20 February
                        1906) the reorganization of the. Duma as the Lower House, and of the
                        Imperial Council (half of which was to be elective) as the Upper House <note

                   <p>The elections were held in March 1906, and on the 27th of April the emperor
                        Nicholas II. solemnly opened the first Duma of the Empire. The “ Cadets ”
                        commanded an overwhelming majority in the Lower House, and their intractable
                        temper and ignorance of affairs became at once apparent. The address in
                        reply to the speech from the throne, voted after a debate in which abstract
                        theories had triumphed over common sense, demanded universal suffrage, the
                        establishment of pure parliamentary government, the abolition of capital
                        punishment, the expropriation of the landlords, a political amnesty, and the
                        suppression of the Imperial Council. When the minister of the interior, M.
                        Goremykin, who had succeeded Witte at the head of the government, met these
                        preposterous demands with a flat refusal, the House Voted, on the motion of
                        M. Kuzmin-Kara vie v, for an appeal to the</p>

                        how little the majority of the dissolved Duma had represented the Russian
                        people. Isolated mutinies in the army followed, and terrorist outrages here
                        and there—notably, in August, the dastardly bomb outrage in the Isle of
                        Apothecaries at St Petersburg, which seriously injured one of M. Stolypin’s
                        little daughters; but the mass of the nation and of the army remained wholly
                        unmoved, while the repetition of troubles was made more difficult by the
                        establishment of field courts martial with summary powers.</p>
                   <p>The second Duma met on the 6th of March 1907. M. Stolypin had not ventured
                        to alter the electoral law without parliamentary consent, but with the aid
                        ofacomplaisant Senate the provisions of the existing law were interpreted in
                        a restrictive sense for the purpose of influencing the elections. The result
                        was, however, hardly more satisfactory to the government. The “ Cadets,” it
                        is true, lost many seats both to the Socialists and to the extreme Right,
                        but they held the balance of the House, of which the Octobrists and the
                        Right together only constituted one-fifth, and their leader, M. Golovin, was
                        elected president of the House. The temper of the second Duma, was, indeed,
                        even more democratic than that of the first; but M. Stolypin did his best to
                        work in harmony with it, realizing that under the existing law another
                        dissolution could but lead to a like result, and shrinking from the only
                        alternative—an alteration of the law by a <hi rend="italic">coup
                            d’etat,</hi> a course which could only be justified on the plea of
                        extreme necessity. On the 19th of March he laid before the House his
                        programme of reforms, which included the emancipation of the peasants from
                        the control of the communes and the handing over to them of the crown lands

                        abolition of the field courts martial was demanded; on the 13th of April a
                        bill for the expropriation of landlords was carried by a two-thirds
                        majority, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="57"> This

                        crisis came with the discovery of a treasonable plot for the subornation of
                        the army, in which many Socialist members of the Duma were involved. On the
                        14th of June Stolypin’s proposal for the arrest of 16 members and the
                        indictment of 55 was shelved by being referred to a committee. The excuse
                        for which the government had been waiting was thus provided, and two days
                        later the Duma was dissolved. An imperial <hi rend="italic">ukaz</hi> fixed
                        the new elections for the 14th of September, and the meeting of the third
                        Duma for the 14th of November; at the same time, in violation of the October
                        manifesto, the electoral law was altered, so as to secure a representation
                        at once more Russian and more conservative. The non-Russian frontier
                        provinces <hi rend="italic">(okrainas)</hi> had even before been
                        under-represented (one member for every 350,000 inhabitants, as against one
                        for every 250,000 in the central provinces); the members returned by Poland,
                        the Caucasus and Siberia were now reduced from 89 to 39, those from the
                        Central Asian steppes (23) were swept away altogether; the total number of
                        deputies was reduced from 524 to 442. Even more drastic were the changes in
                        the electoral machinery, by far the most complicated in Europe, established
                        by the law of 1905. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                        </note> The result was that in the third Duma, which met on the 15th of
                        November 1907, the conservative Right preponderated as much as the Left had
                        done in its two predecessors. Its president,</p>
                   <p>M. Khomiakov, had been one of the founders of the “ Union of 17 October/’
                        but even the Octobrists formed but a third of the House and were compelled
                        to act with the reactionaries of the Right; and the vice-president, Prince
                        Volkonsky, was a member of the Union of the Russian People.</p>
                   <p>On the whole, the new Duma was fairly representative of the changed temper
                        of the Russian people, disillusioned and weary of anarchy. The government
                        had done wisely in obscuring the passion for democratic ideals by an appeal
                        to Russian chauvinism, an appeal soon to bear fruit in disuniting the
                        revolutionary parties. The congress of <hi rend="italic">zemstvos,</hi>
                        hitherto the focus of Liberalism, had petitioned the government, before the
                        opening of the third Duma, to take measures for the restoration of order.
                        The authorities began to exhibit something of their old spirit. M. Dubrovin,
                        president of the Union of the Russian People and organizer of <hi
                            rend="italic">pogroms,</hi> having written a letter of congratulation to
                        the tsar on the occasion of the <hi rend="italic">coup d'état,</hi> received
                        a gracious reply; the hideous reign of terror of the “ Black Hundred ” in
                        Odessa did not prevent the Grand-duke Constantine from accepting the badge
                        of membership of the Union. The ordinary laws, too, had been suspended; the
                        fining and confiscation of newspapers had been resumed, and the “ Cadets ”
                        had been forbidden to hold a congress. All this, however, did not argue an
                        intention on the part of the government to revert to the autocratic <hi
                            rend="italic">status quo.</hi> M. Stolypin indeed defended the <hi
                            rend="italic">coup d'état</hi> in the Duma on the ground that the
                        autocrat had merely altered what the autocrat had originally granted; but,
                        while laying stress on the necessity for restoring order in the body
                        politic, he announced a long programme of reforms, including agrarian
                        measures, reform of local government and its extension in the frontier
                        provinces, and state insurance of workmen. The most far-reaching of these
                        reforms, carried in the first session of the third Duma, was the partial
                        abolition of the communal and family ownership of land, which involved the
                        establishment of a class of true peasant-proprietors. <note anchored="true"

                            peasant-proprietorship was passed on December 21st.' </note> Besides
                        this, the Duma had passed before its adjournment on the 28th of October 1908
                        much useful legislation, some 300 bills in all, including two for the
                        building of important railways on the Amur and in Siberia. Nor had it
                        exhibited by any means a wholly docile spirit. On the 7th of June, for
                        instance, M. Guchkov attacked the maladministration in the navy, pointing
                        out that no reforms were possible so long as grand-dukes were at the head of
                        its departments. The Duma endorsed this all but unanimously, and as the
                        result the Grand-dukes Peter and •Sergius resigned their posts of
                        inspector-general of Engineers and Ordnance respectively, and the*
                        Grand-duke Nicholas his chairmanship of the Committee of National Defence. A
                        year later the Duma again came into collision with the government in a
                        matter highly illuminating of the struggle between the ancient traditions
                        and the new ideas in Russia. On the 14th of June 1909 a bill was passed
                        removing the disabilities hitherto attaching to some 15,000,000 of Old
                        Believers. In spite of strenuous government opposition, inspired by the
                        authorities of the Orthodox Church, amendments were carried allowing
                        dissident ministers to assume ecclesiastical titles and to preach, and
                        permitting Christians to join non-Christian religions or even to describe
                        themselves as unbelievers. Thus a step forward was made in securing the
                        freedom of conscience proclaimed in the October manifesto and denounced by a
                        synod of Orthodox bishops at Kiev in 1908, though the rights granted by the
                        Duma were seriously curtailed in the Imperial Council, and have been largely
                        rendered a dead letter by the action of the administration.</p>
                   <p>Meanwhile the pan-Russian movement had been gaining apace. At first it bad
                        seemed that the new birth of Russia would lead to a revival of pan-Slavism,
                        directed not, as in the middle of the 19th century, against Austria but
                        against Germany. In May 1908 a deputation of the Slav members of the
                        Austrian <hi rend="italic">Reichsrat</hi> paid a ceremonial visit to the
                        Duma at St Petersburg, and in this <hi rend="sup">u</hi> neo-Slav ”
                        demonstration M. Dmowski, leader of the Polish party in the Duma, took part.
                        In the following year, however, the situation was completely altered, a
                        result due to the growing anti-Polish feeling in the Duma and, more
                        especially, to the support given by the Austrian Slavs to the annexation of
                        Bosnia and Herzegovina. This event caused the utmost excitement in Russia;
                        the crown prince of Servia, who arrived in St Petersburg on the 28th of
                        October to ask for the armed assistance of the tsar, was received with
                        enthusiasm by all classes of the people; and, though armed interverition was
                        impossible, M. Isvolsky took the lead in the abortive demand for a European
                        conference (see Europe: <hi rend="italic">History).</hi> Neo-Slav dreams
                        were now replaced by a passionate desire to consolidate the Russian empire
                        on a purely Russian basis. Even the remnant of the “ Cadets ” had by this
                        time renounced their sympathy with Polish aspirations, and in the matter of
                        Finland the Duma proved itself even more imperial than the emperor himself.
                        The Finnish question is dealt with elsewhere (see Finland: <hi rend="italic"
                            >History).</hi> Here it may suffice to mention, as illustrating the
                        changed temper of the Russian national assembly, that the Russian majority
                        of the Duma included among the imperial questions in Finland which the
                        Finnish diet ought to refer to the imperial legislature not only all
                        military matters—as the tsar demanded (Rescript of October 14)—but the
                        question of the use of the Russian language in the grand-duchy, the
                        principles of the Finnish administration, police, justice, education,
                        formation of business companies and of associations, public meetings, the
                        press, the customs tariff, the monetary system, means of communication, and
                        the pilot and lighthouse system. The old tendency illustrated by the outcome
                        of the revolutionary movements of 1848 was once more in evidence—the
                        tendency of merely artificial theories of democratic liberty to succumb to
                        the immemorial instinct of race and race ascendancy.</p>
                   <p>As an international force Russia had been, of course, all but completely
                        crippled by the outcome of the Japanese War and the subsequent revolution.
                        Her recovery, however, revealed the immense reserves of her strength. On the
                        30th of July 1907 she signed a convention with Japan of mutual respect for
                        treaty and territorial rights, and guaranteeing the integrity of China. On
                        the 31st of August of the same year the long period of mutual suspicion
                        between Great Britain and Russia was closed by a convention for an amicable
                        settlement of all questions likely to disturb the relations of the two
                        Powers in Asia generally, including the demarcation of Persia into spheres
                        of influence (see Persia: <hi rend="italic">History).</hi> This new <hi
                            rend="italic">entente</hi> with Great Britain, cemented by a visit paid
                        by King Edward VII. to the tsar at Reval on the 9th June 1908, helped to
                        knit close once more the loosened alliance with France, and so to preserve
                        the threatened balance of Europe. That in the work of restoring its military
                        position the Russian government had the support of the Russian parliament
                        was proved by a subsidy of £11,000,000 voted by the Duma, on the 30th of
                        December 1909, for the special service of the reorganization and
                        redistribution of the army. (W. A. P.)</p>
                   <p>                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Bibliography.—The history of Russia, especially that of
                            the last few years, has formed the subject of a vast number of works, of
                            very varying authority, in many languages. In Russia itself the first
                            great history of the Russian empire was that of N. M. Karamzin (12
                            vols., St Petersburg, 1818-29; French translation, 11 vols., 1819-26),
                            which, though reactionary in tone and largely superseded, remains a
                            classic. . The next monumental history of Russia, that of Sergei
                            Mikhailovich Soloviev (29 vols., Moscow, 1863-75), marks the enormous
                            advance made since Karamzin’s day in historical method and research.
                            Soloviev's history, from the earliest times to 1774, is based throughout
                            on original investigation of sources, and therefore, though inferior to

                        is only possible to give a classified selection. In general, the reader must
                        be warned that most Russian works on history, especially those dealing with
                        recent years, are inspired by a violent party bias—the inevitable result of
                        the conflict of diametrically opposed political ideals,-yand this quality is
                        shared by not a few foreign books about Russia.</p>
