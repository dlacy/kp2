<p><span class="font0">He left NcAvington Green in the same year and established himself in chambers in the Temple. In his circlc of friends at&nbsp;this time were “ Conversation ” Sharp and the artists Flaxman,&nbsp;Opie, Martin Shec and Fuseli. He also made the acquaintance&nbsp;of Charles James Fox, with whom he visited the galleries in&nbsp;Paris in 1802, and whose friendship introduced him to Holland&nbsp;House. In 1803 he moved to 22 St James’s Place, where for&nbsp;fifty years he entertained all the celebrities of London. Flax-man and Stothard had a share in the decorations of the house,&nbsp;which Rogers had almost rebuilt, and now proceeded to fill&nbsp;with pictures and other works of art. IIis collections at his&nbsp;death realized £50,000. An invitation to one of Rogers’s&nbsp;breakfasts was a formal entry into literary society, and his&nbsp;dinners were even more selcct. His social success was due&nbsp;less to his literary position than to his powers as a conversationalist, his educated taste in all matters of art, and no&nbsp;doubt to his sarcastic and bitter wit, for which he excused&nbsp;himself by saying that he had such a small voice that no one&nbsp;listened if he said pleasant things. Above all, he seems to&nbsp;have had a genius for bencvolence. “ He certainly had the&nbsp;kindest heart and unkindest tongue of any one I ever knew,”&nbsp;said Fanny Kemble. He helped the poet Robert Bloomfield,&nbsp;he reconciled Moore with Jeffrey and with Byron, and he&nbsp;relieved Sheridan’s difficulties in the last days of his life.&nbsp;Moore, who refused help from all his friends, and would only be&nbsp;under obligations to his publishers, found it possible to accept&nbsp;assistance from Rogers. He procured a pension for H. F.&nbsp;Cary, the translator of Dante, and obtained for Wordsworth&nbsp;his sinecure as distributor of stamps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is difficult to realize the length of time that Rogers played the part of literary dictator in England. He made his reputation by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Pleasiires of Memory</span><span class="font0"> when Cowper’s fame was&nbsp;still in the making. He became the friend of Wordsworth,&nbsp;Scott and Byron, and lived long enough to give an opinion as&nbsp;to the fitness of Alfred Tennyson for the post of poet laureate.&nbsp;Alexander Dyce, from the time of his first introduction to&nbsp;Rogers, was in the habit of writing down the anecdotes with&nbsp;which his conversation abounded. From the mass of material&nbsp;thus accumulated he made a selection which he arranged under&nbsp;various headings and published in 1856 as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Recollections of the&nbsp;Tabk-Talk of Samuel Rogers, to which is added Porsoniana.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Rogers himself kept a notebook, in which he entered impressions&nbsp;of the conversation of many of his distinguished friends—Charles&nbsp;James Fox, Edmund Burke, Henry Grattan, Richard Porson,&nbsp;John Horne Tooke, Talleyrand, Lord Erskine, Sir Walter&nbsp;Scott, Lord Grenville and the duke of Wellington. They were&nbsp;published by his nephew William Sharpe in 1859 as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Recollections by Samuel Rogers,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Reminiscences and Table-Talk of&nbsp;Samuel Rogers, Banker, Poet, and Pairon of the Arts, 1763-18JJ</span><span class="font0"> (1903), by G. H. Powell, is an amalgamation of these two&nbsp;authorities. Rogers held various honorary positions: he&nbsp;was one of the trustees of the National Gallery; and he served&nbsp;on a commission to inquire into the management of the British&nbsp;Museum, and on another for the rebuilding of the Houses of&nbsp;Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meanwhile his literary production was slow. A poem of some autobiographical interest, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">An Epistle to a Fnend</span><span class="font0"> (Richard&nbsp;Sharp), published in 1798, describes Rogers’s ideal of a happy&nbsp;life. This was followed twelve years later by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage of&nbsp;Columbus</span><span class="font0"> (1810), and by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jacqueline</span><span class="font0"> (1814), a narrative poem,&nbsp;written in the four-accent measure of the newer writers, and&nbsp;published in the same volume with Byron’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lara.</span><span class="font0"> His reflective&nbsp;poem on </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Human Life</span><span class="font0"> (1819), on which he had been engaged for&nbsp;twelve years, is written in his earlier manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1814 Rogers made a tour on the Continent with his sister Sarah. He travelled through Switzerland to Italy, keeping a&nbsp;full diary of events and impressions, and had made his way to&nbsp;Naples when the news of Napoleon’s escape from Elba obliged&nbsp;him to hurry home. Seven years later he returned to Italy,&nbsp;paying a visit to Byron and Shelley at Pisa. Out of the earlier&nbsp;of these tours arose his last and longest work, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Italy.</span><span class="font0"> The first&nbsp;part was published anonymously in 1822; the second, with his&nbsp;name attachcd, in 1828. Thc production was at first a failure,&nbsp;but Rogers was determined to make it a success. He enlarged&nbsp;and revised the poem, and commissioned illustrations from&nbsp;J. M. Turner, Thomas Stothard and Samuel Prout. These were&nbsp;engraved on steel in the sumptuous edition of 1830. The book'&nbsp;then proved a great success, and Rogers followed it up with an&nbsp;equally sumptuous edition of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span><span class="font0"> (1838). In 1850, on&nbsp;Wordsworth’s death, Rogers was asked to succeed him as poet&nbsp;laureate, but declined the honour on account of his great age.&nbsp;For the last five years of his life he was confined to his chair in&nbsp;consequence of a fall in the Street. He died in London on the&nbsp;18th of December 1855.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A full account of Rogers is given in two works by P. W. Clayden, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Early Life of Samuel Rogers</span><span class="font0"> (1887) and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rogers and his Contemporaries</span><span class="font0"> (2 vols., 1889). One of the best accounts of Rogers, containing many examples of his caustic wit, is by Abraham Hayward&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Edinburgh Review</span><span class="font0"> for July 1856. See also the Aldine edition&nbsp;(1857) of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Poetical Works,</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Journals</span><span class="font0"> of Byron and of&nbsp;Moore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROGERS, WILLIAM (1819-1896), English clergyman and educational reformer, was born in London on the 24th of&nbsp;November 1819, the son of a barrister. Educated at Eton and&nbsp;at Balliol College, Oxford, he entered Durham University in&nbsp;1842, to study theology, and was ordained in 1843. In 1845&nbsp;he was appointed to St Thomas Charterhouse, where he remained&nbsp;for eighteen years, throwing himself passionately into the&nbsp;work of education of his poor, degraded and often criminal&nbsp;parishioners. He began by establishing a school for ragamuffins&nbsp;in a blacksmith’s abandoned shed, and with the generous help&nbsp;of friends he gradually extended its scope until the whole parish&nbsp;was a network of schools. In 1858 he was appointed a member&nbsp;of the Royal Commission to inquire into popular education, and&nbsp;he was returned a representative of the London School Board&nbsp;after the passing of Forster’s Act in 1870. In 1863 the bishop&nbsp;of London gave him the living of St Botolph Bishopsgate.&nbsp;Rogers was also made a prebendary of St Paul’s, and in 1857 he&nbsp;had been appointed Chaplain in Ordinary to the Queen. Having&nbsp;largely solved at St Thomas’s the problem of elementary education, at Bishopsgate Rogers tackled the no* less difficult one of&nbsp;middle-class schools. Hc believed in secular education, leaving&nbsp;doctrinal training to parents and clergy. To the cry against&nbsp;“ godless education,” Rogers impulsively replied, “ Hang&nbsp;theology; let us begin and his nickname of “ Hang-theology&nbsp;Rogers ” stuck to him for the rest of his life. The Cowper Street&nbsp;Schools, costing £20,000, were the practical result of his energy.&nbsp;His next great work was the reconstruction of Edward Alleyn’s&nbsp;charity at Dulwich. The new college was opened in 1870; new&nbsp;buildings were erected for the lower school, and the lion’s share&nbsp;of. the work fell upon Rogers. The culmination of his labours&nbsp;was the opening, on his seventy-fifth birthday, of the Bishops-gate Institute, including a hall, with accommodation for 500&nbsp;people and a reference and lending library. On the same day a&nbsp;portrait and gift of plate was made him at the Mansion House,&nbsp;before a distinguished gathering. Lord Rosebery, then Prime&nbsp;Minister, observed in his speech that though bishoprics and&nbsp;deaneries had not been the rector’s lot, there was not a poor&nbsp;Jew in Houndsditch or Petticoat Lane whose face would not&nbsp;brighten when he saw’ him coming. When he died, on the 19th&nbsp;of January 1896, this might have served as an appropriate&nbsp;epitaph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROGIER, CHARLES LATOUR (1800-1885), Belgian statesman, descended from a Belgian family settled in the department of the Nord in France, was born at St Quentin on 17th August&nbsp;1800. His father, an officer in the French army, perished in&nbsp;the Russian campaign of 1812; and the family moved to Liege,&nbsp;where the eldest- son, Firmin, held a professorship.
