<p><span class="font0">His private Memoirs and Diaries, with a selection from his correspondence and other papers, were published by his&nbsp;sons in 1840, in two volumes octavo. An </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eloge,</span><span class="font0"> by M.&nbsp;Constant, was published at Paris in 1819.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b. l.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROMNEY, NEW, a town in the county of Kent, in the Lathe of Sheepway, seventy-two miles from London. It&nbsp;was once a place of much more importance than it is at&nbsp;present. It is surrounded with rich but unhealthy marshes,&nbsp;and is defended against the sea by a strong dyke, called&nbsp;Dunchurch Wall, on which is a good carriage road over the&nbsp;marshes. The population was in 1801, 755; in 1811, 841;&nbsp;in 1821, 962, and in 1831,983.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROMORANTIN, an arrondisement of the department of the Loire and Cher, in France, eight hundred and eleven&nbsp;square miles in extent. It comprehends six cantons, divided into forty-eight communes, containing, in 1836, 47,722&nbsp;inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same name at&nbsp;the junction of the Romorantin and the Saudre, and has&nbsp;some beautiful promenades on the bank of the former river.&nbsp;It contains 1200 houses, with 7181 inhabitants, who manufacture to a considerable extent woollen cloth and tanned&nbsp;leather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROMSEY, or Rumsey, a large market and borough town of the county of Hants, seventy-three miles from London. It is in the division of Andover, of the hundred of&nbsp;King’s Sombome, and stands on the river Test, on the road&nbsp;between Southampton and Salisbury, and is surrounded by&nbsp;pleasant meadows, which, by irrigation, are rendered highly&nbsp;fertile. It is divided into two parishes; with one church&nbsp;in common, a spacious building in the form of a cross,&nbsp;which, in ancient times, was the chapel of a richly endowed&nbsp;abbey. All the early abbesses were of royal blood, and so&nbsp;distinguished by their piety as to be deemed saints. The&nbsp;trade, which formerly consisted in making woollen stuffs,&nbsp;has nearly been annihilated; by the late law it elected annually four aldermen and twelve counsellors, who chuse the&nbsp;mayor. The population was in 1801, 4274; in 1811, 4297;&nbsp;in 1821,5128; andin 1831,5432.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROMPEE, or Rompu, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Heraldry,</span><span class="font0"> is applied to ordinaries that are represented as broken; and to chevrons, bends, or the like, whose upper points are cut off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RONA, one of the Hebrides, is reckoned about twenty leagues distant from the north-east point of Ness in Lewis,&nbsp;and is about a mile long, and half a mile broad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RONCESVALLES, a valley in Spain, in the province ofNavarne, and district ofSanguessa. It stands at the&nbsp;foot of the Pyrenees, and is the largest valley in the province, but covered with wood. The town of the name is&nbsp;small, but on the great road from France to Madrid, having a church, an Augustin monastery, and an hospital. It&nbsp;has become a place of celebrity from the warlike deeds&nbsp;which the spot has witnessed, both by the defeat of Roland&nbsp;and the twelve peers of France at a remote period, and by&nbsp;the operations under the Duke of Wellington and Marshal&nbsp;Soult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RONDA, a city of Spain, in the kingdom of Granada, and province of Andalusia. Ronda is about four thousand&nbsp;five hιmdred feet above the level of the sea, but being surrounded with mountains of vast elevation, it is, in fact, with&nbsp;regard to them, a largely extended valley. The mountains&nbsp;that surround it are more or less covered with snow throughout the whole year; and it is conveyed to the cities of&nbsp;Seville, Cadiz, Gibraltar, and other places, for the daily&nbsp;consumption of their luxurious inhabitants. The plain on&nbsp;which the city stands is one of the most verdant and fertile&nbsp;spots in this the best part of Spain. This city, long a Roman station, under the name of Arunda, abounds with inscriptions, monuments, and ruins of that people, which has&nbsp;been diligently explored by sundry antiquarians. The inhabitants amount to about twenty thousand. Longevity is</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">so very general, that it is a proverb in Andalusia, that in Ronda a man at eighty is still a boy. The public buildings&nbsp;are numerous, but not striking, though some of the churches&nbsp;and convents have the ornaments and riches so commonly&nbsp;belonging to spiritual edifices in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROORTERPOOR, a considerable town of Hindustan, province of Delhi, district of Morabad, forty-two miles north&nbsp;hy east from Bareilly. Long. 79. 20. E. Lat. 29. 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RONSARD, Peter de, a French poet, was born at the castle of Poissoniere in Vendomois in 1524. He was descended of a noble family, and was educated at Paris in the&nbsp;college of Navarre. Academical pursuits not suiting his&nbsp;genuis, he left college, and became page to the duke of&nbsp;Orleans, who resigned him to James Stuart, king of Scots,&nbsp;married to Magdalene of France. Ronsard continued in&nbsp;Scotland with King James upwards of two years, and afterwards went to France, where he was employed by the duke&nbsp;of Orleans in several negotiations. He accompanied Lazarus de Baif to the diet of Spires. Having from the conversation of this learned man imbibed a passion for the belles-lettres, he studied the Greek language with BaiPs son under&nbsp;Dorat. It is reported of Ronsard, that his practice was to&nbsp;study till two o’clock in the morning; and when he went to&nbsp;bed, to awaken Baif, who resumed his place. The muses&nbsp;possessed in his eyes an infinity of charms; and he cultivated them with such success, that he acquired the appellation of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Prince of Poets</span><span class="font0"> of his time. Henry II.&nbsp;Francis II. Charles IX. and Henry III. loaded him with&nbsp;favours. Having gained the first prize of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jeux Floraux,</span><span class="font0"> they thought the reward promised below the merit&nbsp;of the work, and the reputation of the poet. The city of&nbsp;Toulouse caused a Minerva of massy silver of considerable&nbsp;value to be made and sent to him. This present was accompanied with a decree, declaring him </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The French Poet,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">by way of distinction. Ronsard afterwards made a present&nbsp;of his Minerva to Henry II., and this monarch appeared as&nbsp;much eluted with this mark of the poet’s esteem for him, as&nbsp;the poet himself could have been had he received the present from his sovereign. Mary, the beautiful and unfortunate queen of Scots, who was equally sensible of his merit&nbsp;with the Toulonese, gave him a rich set of table-plate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He wrote hymns, odes, a poem called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Franciad, </span><span class="font0">eclogues, epigrams, sonnets, &amp;c. In his odes he takes bombast for poetic raptures. He wishes to imitate Pindar; and&nbsp;by labouring too much for lofty expressions, he loses himself in a cloud of words. He is obscure and harsh to the&nbsp;last degree; faults which he might easily have avoided by&nbsp;studying the works of Marot, who had, before he wrote,&nbsp;brought French poetry very near to perfection. But what&nbsp;could be expected from a man who had so little taste, that&nbsp;he called Marot’s works, ‘ a dunghill, from which rich grains&nbsp;of gold, by industrious working, might be drawn ?’ He has,&nbsp;however, some pieces not destitute of real merit; and there&nbsp;are perhaps few effusions of the French muse more truly&nbsp;poetical than his Four Seasons of the Year, where a most&nbsp;fertile imagination displays all its riches. Ronsard, though&nbsp;it is doubtful whether he ever was in orders, held several&nbsp;benefices in commendam; and he died at Saint-Cosme-les-Tours, one of these, December 27, 1585, being then 61&nbsp;years of age. He appeared more ridiculous as a man than&nbsp;as a poet; he was particularly vain, and his immoderate indulgence in pleasure, joined to his literary labours, served&nbsp;to hasten his old age. In his 50th year he was weak and&nbsp;valetudinary, and subject to attacks of the gout. He retained his wit, his vivacity, and his readiness at poetic composition, to his last moments. Ronsard’s poems have been&nbsp;published in folio, in quarto, and in 10 volumes duodecimo,&nbsp;in 1567.</span></p>
