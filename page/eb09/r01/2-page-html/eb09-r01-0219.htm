<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In many forms it is not easy to see Low tbe ova once liberated into the body-cavity find their way safely into&nbsp;the small opening of the discontinuous oviduct. In the&nbsp;Frog, however, tracts of the peritoneal epithelium become&nbsp;ciliated, so propelling the ova in the right direction. In&nbsp;Reptiles, Birds, and Mammals the open end of the oviduct&nbsp;is widened and fringed, and lies close to or even touching&nbsp;the ovary; muscular fibres too are present, and more or&nbsp;less active movements of this dilated end over the ovarian&nbsp;surface have been alleged to occur. The oviduct once&nbsp;reached, the downward progress of the ovum is ensured by&nbsp;the cilia of the epithelial lining, and probably also by&nbsp;peristaltic movements of its muscular coat.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menstruation.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">—The process of menstruation (menses, catamenia), although from the earliest times the subject&nbsp;of medical inquiry, is by no means yet clearly understood.&nbsp;It occurs usually at intervals of a lunar month in all women&nbsp;during their period of potential fertility (fecundity), and,&nbsp;so far from being confined to the human species, has been&nbsp;observed at the period of “ heat ” in a large number of&nbsp;Mammals. Though thus clearly a normal physiological&nbsp;process, it yet evidently lies on the borders of pathological&nbsp;change, as is evidenced not only by the pain which so frequently accompanies it, and the local and constitutional&nbsp;disorders which so frequently arise in this connexion, but&nbsp;by the general systemic disturbance and local histological&nbsp;changes of which the discharge is merely the outward&nbsp;expression and result. The histological facts are briefly&nbsp;as follows. The mucous lining of the uterus consists of a&nbsp;loose vascular connective tissue covered by ciliated epithelium and containing numerous glands of clear alkaline&nbsp;secretion. This mucous lining before the outset of menstruation becomes loose and oedematous, its lymphatics&nbsp;being greatly distended; it thus thickens considerably,&nbsp;pressing against the cervix of the uterus. An extravasation of blood’ from the capillaries next takes place over&nbsp;the whole surface of the mucous layer, and the discharge&nbsp;is thus set up. This consists at first of blood largely&nbsp;diluted with the secretion of the uterine glands, but soon&nbsp;becomes mixed with detritus from the disintegration of the&nbsp;mucous coat, of which not only the general epithelial cells&nbsp;but those of the neck of the glands, and even part of the&nbsp;subjacent connective tissue, undergo fatty degeneration&nbsp;and fall off, occasionally even in a mass. After from three&nbsp;to six days the blood ceases to appear, and the lost epithelium is rapidly replaced, apparently by proliferation from&nbsp;the necks of the glands. By the ninth or tenth day the&nbsp;mucous coat is fully healed and the beginnings of the&nbsp;next menstrual process recommence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The age at which the process commences varies with race and climate, with nutrition and growth, with habit of&nbsp;life </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> with differences between town and country life),&nbsp;and with mental and moral characteristics. Of these,&nbsp;however, climate seems most important; thus, while in&nbsp;northern Europe the average age is reckoned at the beginning of the fifteenth year, in the tropics it seems to&nbsp;commence in the ninth or tenth. The cessation of menstruation usually takes place between the age of forty-five&nbsp;and fifty, and, somewhat as the secondary characteristics&nbsp;of female puberty coincide with its appearance, a less&nbsp;distinct reduction of these is associated with its close; in&nbsp;many cases secondary resemblances to the masculine type&nbsp;may supervene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The old theories of menstruation were that it served to rid the system of impure blood, that it simply corresponded to the period of “ heat ” observed in lower&nbsp;animals, or, later, that it was associated with ovulation,—&nbsp;which indeed seems broadly to correspond with the end of</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the menstrual period. At present there may be said to be tv<sup>r</sup>o rival theories. According to the first of these the process is viewed as a kind of surgical “freshening ”of the uterus&nbsp;for the reception of the ovum, whereby the latter during&nbsp;the healing process can be attached safely to the uterine&nbsp;wall. The other view is exactly the reverse of this. Its&nbsp;upholders regard the growth of the mucous coat before&nbsp;the commencement of the flow as a preparation for the&nbsp;reception of an ovum, if duly fertilized, and the menstrual&nbsp;process itself as the expression of the failure of these preparations, in short as a consequence of the non-occurrence&nbsp;of pregnancy. A decided majority of gynaecologists appear&nbsp;to incline to the latter view<sup>r</sup>. (1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Comparative Anatomy of the Reproductive Organs.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">—The multicellular animals afford a remarkable series of gradations from the simplest imaginable case in which certain&nbsp;cells, independently of accessory organs, and even isolated&nbsp;from each other, develop into ova and spermatozoa. In&nbsp;the vast majority of cases, however, definite groups of cells&nbsp;are set apart as the essential reproductive glands—the ovary&nbsp;and the testis. The contents of these may simply break&nbsp;loose, but definite excretory ducts are very frequently&nbsp;present, and upon these very varied complications may&nbsp;arise. To the male ducts a seminal reservoir may be&nbsp;added. More or less specialized glandular regions may&nbsp;contribute their secretion to the seminal fluid, and a more&nbsp;or less complicated copulatory apparatus may also be&nbsp;superadded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The female accessory organs are equally simple in principle and complex in detail. Nutritive material may be furnished to the ova by special yolk glands, or by the&nbsp;Avails of the oviduct; this too may supply special envelopes, and may exhibit dilatations for the preservation or&nbsp;development of the ova (uterus), for the reception of the&nbsp;male copulatory organ (vagina), or for the temporary&nbsp;storage of the seminal fluid thus introduced (receptaculum&nbsp;seminis). It is necessary therefore briefly to outline the&nbsp;most important facts of the comparative anatomy and&nbsp;physiology of these organs in the various groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Passing over the little-understood </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Orthonectida</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Dicyemida</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Parasitism, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">vol. xviii. p. 259), the Sponges&nbsp;present the very simplest case above referred to. Here&nbsp;and there throughout the mesoderm a cell may be observed&nbsp;enlarging to form an ovum, or segmenting to form a mass&nbsp;of spermatozoa, but no definite reproductive glands, much&nbsp;less any duct or accessory organ, are present, and at most&nbsp;the ovum forms for itself a kind of nest among the surrounding cells, an approach towards the epithelial follicle&nbsp;of higher forms being thus presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ccelentera.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">—In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Anthozoa</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> the generative organs are developed as ridges on the gastric septa, their products&nbsp;passing out by the mouth; and in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ctenophora</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> each&nbsp;radial canal bears an ovarian ridge on one side and a&nbsp;testicular on the other. Keen controversy has raged over&nbsp;the state of matters in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hydromedusse.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Kleinenberg&nbsp;derived both ovum and sperms in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hydra</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> from the ectoderm, while Van Beneden endeavoured to prove the&nbsp;invariable origin of the ovarian tract from the endoderm&nbsp;and that of the testicular from the ectoderm; but subsequent observers, so far from confirming the constancy of&nbsp;this arrangement, have affirmed in many forms the ectodermic and in others the endodermic origin in both cases.&nbsp;Weismann and He Yarenne have recently very completely&nbsp;demonstrated the more remarkable fact that in a great&nbsp;number of forms the generative elements do not arise in&nbsp;the so-called generative buds or gonophores at all, but&nbsp;actually migrate thither from the parenchyma (coenen-chyma) of the nutritive polyp or trophosome—the latter&nbsp;observer indeed going so far as to allege the primitive&nbsp;origin by ova and spermatozoa in all cases from the endo-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
