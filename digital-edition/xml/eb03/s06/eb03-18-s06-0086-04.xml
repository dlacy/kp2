or <hi rend="smallcaps">Chirurgeon,</hi> one that professes the art of <hi rend="smallcaps">Surgery.</hi></p><p>In England there are two diſtinct companies of surgeons now occupying the ſcience or faculty of ſurgery ; the one company called <hi rend="italic">barbers,</hi> the other <hi rend="italic">ſurgeons,</hi> which latter are not incorporated.—The two are united to sue, and be ſued, by the names of maſters or governors and commonalty of the myſtery of barbers and ſurgeons of London. 3 2 H. VIII. c. 42.</p><p>No perſon uſing any barbery or ſhaving in London, ſhall occupy any ſurgery, letting of blood, or other matter ; drawing of teeth only excepted. And no perſon uſing the myſtery or craft of ſurgery ſhall occupy or exerciſe the feat or craft of barbary, or ſhaving, neither by himſelf, nor any other for his uſe. 32 H. VIII. c. 42.</p><p>By the ſame ſtatute, ſurgeons are obliged to have ſigns at their doors.</p><p>The French chirurgeons being refuſed to be admitted into the univerſities (notwithſtanding that their art makes a branch of medicine), on pretence of its bordering a little on butchery or cruelty, aſſociated themſelves into a brotherhood, under the protection of S. Coſmus and S. Damian: on which account, according to the laws of their inſtitution, they are obliged to dreſs and look to wounds <hi rend="italic">gratis</hi> the firſt Monday of each month.</p><p>They diſtinguiſh between a chirurgeon of the long robe and a barber-chirurgeon. The firſt has ſtudied phyſic, and is allowed to wear a gown. The ſkill of the other, beſides what relates to the management of the beard, is ſuppoſed to be confined to the more simple and eaſy operations in chirurgy ; as bleeding, tooth-drawing, &amp;c.</p><p>They were formerly diſtinguiſhed by badges : thoſe of the long gown bore a caſe of inſtruments ; the barber, a baſon.</p><p>THAT part of medicine which treats of diſeaſes to be cured or alleviated by the hand, by inſtruments, or by external applications.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">History of Surgery.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">That</hi> ſurgery was coeval with the other branches of medicine, or perhaps antecedent to any of them, will not admit of doubt. The wars and contentions which have taken place among mankind almoſt ever ſince their creation, neceſſarily imply that there would be occaſion for ſurgeons at a very early period ; and probably theſe external injuries would for ſome time be the only diſeaſes for which a cure would be attempted, or perhaps thought practicable.—In the ſacred writings we find much mention of balſams, particularly the balm of Gilead, as excellent in the cure oſ wounds; though at the ſame time we are informed that there were ſome wounds which this balſam could not heal.</p><p>Concerning the ſurgery practiſed among the Egyptians, Jews, and Aſiatic nations, we know little or nothing. The Greeks were thoſe from whom the art deſcended to us, though they confessedly received it from the eaſtern nations. The firſt Greek ſurgeons on record are Æfculapîus and his sons Podalirius and Machaon. Æsculapius flouriſhed about 50 years before the Trojan war ; and his two ſons diſtinguiſhed themſelves in that war both by their valour and ſkill in curing wounds. This indeed is the whole of the medical ſkill attributed to them by Homer ; for in the plague which broke out in the Grecian camp, he does not mention their being at all conſulted. Nay, what is ſtill more ſtrange, tho’ he ſometimes mentions his heroes having their bones broke, he never takes notice of their being reduced or cured by any other than ſupernatural means ; as in the caſe of Æneas, whoſe thigh-bone was broken by a ſtone caſt at him by Diomed. The methods which theſe two famous ſurgeons uſed in curing the wounds of their fellow-ſoldiers ſeems to have been the extracting or cutting out the darts which inflicted them, and applying emollient fomentations or ſtyptics to them when neceſſary : and to theſe they undoubtedly attributed much more virtue than they could poſſibly posseſs ; as appears from the following lines, where Homer deſcribes Eurypylus as wounded and under the hands of Patroclus, who would certainly practiſe according to the directions of the ſurgeons.</p><p>Patroclus cut the forky ſteel away ;</p><p>Then in his hands a bitter root he bruis’d, The wound he waſh’d, the ſtyptic juice infus’d. The <hi rend="italic">closing fleſh</hi> that inſtant ceas’d to glow ; The wound to torture, and the blood to flow.<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0093.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0087"/>
Till the days of Hippocrates we know very little of what was the practice of the Greek ſurgeons. From him, however, we learn, that the practice of blood-letting, cupping, and ſcarification, was known to them ; alſo the uſe of warm and emollient fomentations, issues made with hot irons, peſſaries, injections, fumigations, &amp;c. Hippocrates alſo gives directions with regard to fractures, luxations, ulcers, siſtulas. He directs the extenſion, reduction, bandages, and ſplints, proper to be uſed in fractures and luxations of different bones, with ſeveral machines to increaſe the extenſion when neceſſary. He directs the laxity and tightneſs of the bandages ; the intervals for unlooſing and binding them on again ; the position and repoſe of the fractured member, and the proper regimen ; and he mentions the time when a callus is uſually formed. He treats alſo of fractures of the ſkull, and the method of applying the trepan. In his treatment of ulcers, he ſpeaks of reducing fungous fleſh by means of eſcharotics, ſome of which are alum, nitre, verdigriſe, quicklime, &amp;c.</p><p>In the time of Ptolemy Philopater of Egypt, medicine, all the branches of which had hitherto been practiſed by the ſame perſon, was now divided into three, viz. the dietetic, pharmaceutic, and ſurgical ; from which time to the preſent, ſurgery has continued to be reckoned a diſtinct profeſſion from medicine, though very improperly, in the opinion of the best authors.</p><p>Surgery appears not to have exiſted in Rome, notwithſtanding the warlike genius of the people, for more than 500 years. Archagathus, a Greek, was the firſt profeſſor of that art in the city; and ſo frequently employed the knife, hot irons, and other cruel methods of cure, that he was branded with the opprobrious title of <hi rend="italic">carnifex,</hi> and expelled the city, where no phyſician or ſurgeon of eminence again made his appearance for 180 years. At this time Aſclepiades undertook the profeſſion of medicine ; but ſeems to have dealt little in ſurgery. Neither have we any thing of importance on that ſubject till the time of Celſus, who flouriſhed during the reigns of Auguſtus and Tiberius.— In his ſurgery, all the improvements from Hippocrates to his own days are collected ; the moſt minute and trifling diſeaſes are not omitted. An eminent ſurgeon, of the moderns, emphatically exhorts every perſon in that profeſſion “ to keep Celſus in his hands by day and by night.” He describes the signs of a fractured ſkull, the method of examining for the fracture, of laying the ſkull bare by an incision in the form of the letter X, and afterwards of cutting away the angles, and of applying the trepan, with the ſigns of danger and of recovery. He obſerved, that sometimes, though very rarely, a fatal concuſſion of the brain might happen, the blood- vessels within the ſkull being burſt, yet the bone remaining entire. After the operation of the trepan, ſponges and cloths wetted with vinegar, and ſeveral other applications, were made to the head ; and, throughout, ſevere abſtinence was enjoined. In violent fractures of the ribs, he ordered veneſection ; low diet ; to guard againſt all agitation of the mind, loud speaking, motion, and every thing that might excite coughing or ſneezing. Cloths wetted with wine, roſes and oil, and other applications, were laid over the fracture. The cure of fractures, in the upper and lower extremities, he ſaid were nearly alike ; that fractures differ in degree of violence and danger, in being ſimple or compound, that is, with or without a wound of the fleſh, and in being near to the joint. He directs the extenſion of the member by aſſiſtants ; the reduction, by the ſurgeon’s hands, of the fractured bones into their natural ſituation ; and to bind the fractured part with bandages of different lengths, previouſly dipped in wine and oil : on the third day freſh bandages are to be applied, and the fractured member fomented with warm vapour, eſpecially during the inflammation. Splinte, if necessary, are to be applied, to retain the bones in a fixed position. The fractured arm is to be ſuſpended in a broad sling hung round the neck : the fractured leg is to be incloſed in a kind of caſe, reaching above the ham, and accommodated likewiſe with a ſupport to the foot, and with straps at the side, to keep the leg ſteady : in the fractured thigh-bone, the caſe is to extend from the top of the hip to the foot. He deſcribes the method of treating compound fractures, and of removing ſmall fragments of splinters of bones ; and the manner of extracting darts. In luxations of the ſhoulder, he mentions ſeveral methods of giving force to the extenſion, and of replacing the diſlocated bone, One method ſimilar to that of Hippocrates was, to ſuſpend the patient by the arm ; the fore part of the ſhoulder, at the ſame time, reſting upon the top of a door, or any other ſuch firm fulcrum. Another method was to lay the patient ſupine, ſome aſſiſtants retaining the body in a fixed position, and others expending the arm in the contrary direction ; the ſurgeon, in the mean time, attempting, by his hands, forcibly to reduce the bone into its former place.</p><p>If a large inflammation was expected to ensue after a wound, it was ſuffered to bleed for ſome time, and blood was drawn from the arm. To wounds accompanied with conſiderable hæinorrhagy, he applied a ſponge wet in vinegar, and constant pressure : If necessary, on account of the violence of the hæmorrhagy, ligatures were made round the veſſels, and ſometimes the bleeding orifice was feared up with the point of a hot iron. On the third day freſh dreſſings were applied. In conſiderable contuſions, with a ſmall wound of the fleſh, if neither blood-veſſels nor nerves prevented, the wound was to be enlarged. Abſtinence and low diet, upon all ſuch accidents, were preſcribed; cloths wet with vinegar, and ſeveral other applications, were to be applied to the inflamed part. He obſerves, that freſh wounds may be healed without compound applications. In external gangrene, he cut into the found fleſh; and when the diſeaſe, in ſpite of every effort, spread, he adviſed amputation of the member. After cutting to the bone, the fleſh was then ſeparated from it, and drawn back, in order to ſave as much fleſh as poſſible to cover the extremity of the bone. Celſus, though extremely diffuſe. in the deſcription of ſurgical diſeaſes, and of various remedies and external applications, treats slightly of the method of amputating ; from which, comparing his treatiſe with the modern ſyſtems, we might infer that the operation was then ſeldomer practiſed than at preſent. He deſcribes the ſymptoms of that dangerous inflammation the carbuncle, and directs, immediately to burn, or to corrode the gangrened part. To promote the ſuppuration of abſceſſes, he orders poultices of barley-meal, or of marſhmallows, or the seeds of linſeed and fenugreek. He alſo mentions the compoſitions of ſeveral repellent cataplaſms. In the <hi rend="italic">erysipelas,</hi> he applies ceruſe, mixed with the juice of ſolanum or nightſhade. Sal ammoniac was ſometimes mixed with his plaſters.</p><p>He is very minute in deſcribing diſeaſes of the eyes, ears, and teeth, and in preſcribing a multitude of remedies and applications. In inflammation of the eyes, he enjoined abſtinence and low diet, rest, and a dark room: if the inflammation was violent, with great pain, he ordered veneſection, and a purgative ; a ſmall poultice of fine flower, ſaffron, and the white of an egg, to be laid to the forehead to ſuppreſs the flow of pituita ; the ſoſe inside of warm wheat bread dipped in wine, to be laid to the eye ; poppy and roſes were alſo added to his collyriums, and various ingredients too tedious to enumerate. In chronic watery deflu-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0094.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0088"/>
xions of the eyes, he applied aſtringents, cupped the temples, and burnt the veins over the temple and forehead. He couched cataracts by depressing the cryſtalline lens to the bottom of the orbit. Teeth, looſened by any accident, he directs, after the example of Hippocrates, to be faſtened with a gold thread to thoſe adjoining on each side. Previous to drawing a tooth, he ordered the gum to be cut round its neck ; and if the tooth was hollow, it was to be filled with lead before extraction, to prevent its breaking by the forceps. He describcs not only the inflammation, but likewiſe the elongation, of the uvula: he alſo delcribes the polvpus, and ſome other diſeaſes affecting the noſe.</p><p>He deſcribes several ſpecies of herniæ or rupture, and the manual aſſiſtance required in thoſe complaints. After the return of the inteſtines into the abdomen, a firm compress was applied to that part of the groin through which they protruded, and was ſecured by a bandage round the loins. In ſome cases, after the return of inteſtinal ruptures, he diminiſhed the quantity of looſe ſkin, and formed a cicatrix, ſo as to contract over the part, to render it more rigid and capable of reſiſting. He deſcribes various diſeaſes of the genital parts, the hydrocele or dropſy of the ſcrotum, a difficulty of urine, and the manner of drawing off the water by a catheter ; the ſigns of ſtone in the bladder, and the method of sounding or feeling for that ſtone. Lithotomy was at that time performed by introducing two fingers into the anus ; the ſtone was then pressed forward to the perinaeum, and a cut made into the bladder ; and by the finger or by a ſcoop the ſtone was extracted. He describes the manner of performing this operation on both the sexes, of treating the patient, and the ſigns of recovery and of danger.</p><p>Celſus directed various corroſive applications and injections to ſiſtulas ; and, in the laſt extremity, opened them to the bottom with a knife, cutting upon a grooved infiniment or conductor. In old callous ulcers, he made a new wound, by either cutting away the hard edges, or corroding them with verdigriſe, quicklime, alum, nitre, and with ſome vegetable eſcharotics. He mentions the ſymptoms of caries in the bone ; directs the bone to be laid bare, and to be pierced with ſeveral holes, or to be burnt or raſped, in order to promote an exfoliation of the corrupted part ; afterwards to apply nitre and ſeveral other ingredients. One of his applications to a cancer was auripigmentum or arſenic. He directs the manner of tapping the abdomen in aſcites, and of drawing blood by the lancet and cupping-glaſſes. His cupping-glaſſes ſeem not to have been ſo convenient as the modern : they were made either of braſs or horn, and were unprovided with a pump. He cured varicoſe veins by uſtion or by inciſion. He gives directions for extracting the dead fœtus ſrom the womb, in whatever poſition it ſhould preſent ; and, after delivery, to apply to the private parts ſoft cloths wet in an infusion of vinegar and roſes. In Celſus’s works there is a great redundance and ſuperfluity of plaſters, ointments, eſcharotics, collyriums, of ſuppurating and diſcutient cataplaſms, and external applications of every kind, both ſimple and compound : Perhaps, amongſt the multitude, there are a few uſeful remedies now laid aſide and neglected.</p><p>The laſt writer of conſequence who flouriſhed at Rome was Galen, phyſician to the emperor Marcus Aurelius. His works are for the moſt part purely medicinal ; although he wrote alſo on ſurgery, and made Commentaries on the Surgery of Hippocrates. He opened the jugular veins, and performed arteriotomy at the temples ; directed leeches, ſcarification, and cupping-glaſſes, to draw blood. He alſo deſcribed with accuracy the different ſpecies of herniæ or ruptures.</p><p>In the year 500 flouriſhed Aetius, in whoſe works we meet with many obſervations omitted by Celſus and Galen, particularly on the ſurgical operations, the diſeaſes of women, the causes of difficult labours, and modes of delivery, He alſo takes notice of the dracunculus, or Guinea worm. Aeſtius, however, is greatly excelled by Paulus Egineta, who flouriſhed in 640 ; whoſe treatiſe on surgery is ſuperior to that of all the other ancients. He directs how to extract darts ; to perform the operation ſometimes required in dangerous cases of rupture or hernia. He treats alſo of aneurism. Galea, Paulus, and all the ancients, ſpeak only of one ſpecies of aneuriſm, and define it to be “ a tumor arising from arterial blood extravaſated from a ruptured artery.” The aneuriſm from a dilatation of the artery is a diſcovery of the moderns. In violent inflammations of the throat, where immediate danger of ſuffocation was threatened, Paulus performed the operation of bronchotomy. In obſtinate defluxions upon the eyes, he opened the jugular veins. He deſcribes the manner of opening the arteries behind the ears in chronic pains of the head. He wrote alſo upon midwifery. Fabricius ab Aquapendente, a celebrated ſurgeon of the 16th century, has followed Celſus and Paulus as text books.</p><p>From the time of Paulus Egineta to the year 900, no writer of any conſequence, either on medicine or ſurgery, appeared. At this time the Arabian phyſicians Rhazes and Avicenna revived in the eaſt the medical art, which, as well as others, was almoſt entirely extinguiſhed in the west. Avicenna’s <hi rend="italic">Canon Medicinae,</hi> or General Syſtem of Medicine and Surgery, was for many ages celebrated through all the ſchools of phyſic. It was principally compiled ſrom the writings of Galen and Rhazes. The latter had correctly deſcribed the spina ventoſa, accompanied with an enlargement of the bone, caries, and acute pain. In difficult labours, he recommends the fillet to aſſiſt in the extraction of the fœtus ; and for the ſame purpoſe, Avicenna recommends the forceps. He deſcribes the compoſition of ſeveral coſmetics to polish the skin, and make the hair grow, or fall off.</p><p>Notwithſtanding this, however, it was not till the time of Albucaſis that ſurgery came into repute among the Arabians. Rhazes complains of their groſs ignorance, and that the manual operations were performed by the phyſicians servants. Albucaſis enumerates a tremendous liſt of operations, sufficient to fill us with horror. The hot iron and cauteries were favourite remedies of the Arabians; and, in inveterate pains, they repoſed, like the Egyptians and eaſtern Aſiatics, great confidence in burning the part. He deſcribes accurately the manner of tapping in aſcites ; mentions ſeveral kinds of inſtruments for drawing blood ; and has left a more ample and correct delineation of ſurgical inſtruments than any of the ancients. He gives various obſtetrical directions for extracting the fœtus in caſes of difficult labour. He mentions the bronchocele, or prominent tumor on the neck, which, he tells us, was moſt frequent among the female ſex. We arc alſo informed by this writer, that the delicacy of the Arabian women did not permit male ſurgeons to perform lithotomy on females ; but when necessary, it was executed by one of their own ſex.</p><p>From the 1lth century to the middle of the 14th, the hiſtory of ſurgery affords nothing remarkable except the importation of that nauſeous diſease the leproſy into Europe. Towards the end of the 15th century the venereal diſeaſe 19 ſaid to have been imported from America by the firſt diſcoverers of that continent.</p><p>At the beginning of the 16th century, ſurgery was held in contempt in this island, and was practiſed indiſcriminately<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0095.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0089"/>
by barbers, farriers, and sow-gelders. Barbers and ſurgeons continued, for 200 years after, to be incorporated in one company both in London and Paris. In Holland and ſome parts of Germany, even at this day, barbers exerciſe the razor and lancet alternately.</p><p>It is within the laſt three centuries that we have any conſiderable improvement in ſurgery ; nor do we know of any eminent Britiſh ſurgical writers until within the laſt 130 years. “ In Germany (ſays Heiſter) all the different ſurgical operations, at the beginning even of the 18th century, were left to empirics ; while regular practitioners were contented to cure a wound, open a vein or an abscess, return a fractured or luxated bone ; but they ſeldom or never ventured to perform any of the difficult operations.” He alſo ſpeaks of their groſs ignorance of the Latin language.</p><p>The firſt ſurgical work of the 16th century worthy of notice is that of J. Carpus. F. ab Aquapendente, an Italian, publiſhed a Syſtem of Surgery, containing a deſcription of the various diſeaſes, accidents, and operations. Boerhaave pays this author the following compliment: <hi rend="italic">Ille ſuperavit omnes, et nemo illi hanc disputat gloriam ; omnibus potius quam hocce carere possumus.</hi> About the ſame period, A. Parey, a Frenchman, made ſeveral important additions to ſurgery, particularly in his collection of caſes of wounds, fractures, and other accidents which occur during war. The ancients, who were ignorant of powder and fire-arms, are defective in this part of military ſurgery. Parey pretends to have firſt invented the method of tying with a needle and ſtrong ſilk- thread waxed the extremities of large arteries, after the amputation of a member. The ligature of the blood- vessels is, however, merely a revival of the ancient practice, which had fallen into diſuſe : Throughout the dark ages, the hot iron, cauteries, and ſtrong aſtringents, were ſubſtituted in its place. B. Maggius and L. Botallus wrote on the cure of gunſhot wounds. J. A. Cruce wrote a ſyſtem of ſurgery</p><p>In the 17th century, ſurgery was enriched with ſeveral ſyſtems, and with detached or miſecllaneous obſervations. The principal authors are, Μ. A. Severinus, V. Vidius, R. Wiſeman, Le Clerc, J. Scultetus, J. Mangetus, C. Magatus, Spigellius, F. Hildanus, T. Bartholin, P. de Marchett.</p><p>Since the commencement of the preſent century, ſurgery has been enriched with many valuable and important improvements, of the greateſt part of which we have availed ourſelves in the courſe of the following treatiſe. But as it would far exceed the limits of a work of this nature to enumerate the names and writings of ſuch authors as have lived within the above period, and beſides, as it appears very unimportant to do ſo, we ſhall at once proceed to the next part of our ſubject.</p><p>CH <hi rend="smallcaps">aP</hi>. II. <hi rend="italic">Of Wounds.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">Of Simple Wounds.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> firſt thing to be conſidered in the inſpection of a wound is, whether it is likely to prove mortal or not. This knowledge can only be had from anatomy, by which the ſurgeon will be able to determine what parte are injured ; and, from the offices which theſe parts are calculated to perform, whether the human frame can ſubſiſt under ſuch injuries. It is not, however, eaſy for the moſt expert anatomiſt always to prognoſticate the event with certainty ; but this rule he ought always to lay down to himſelf, to draw the moſt favourable prognoſis the caſe will bear, or even more than the rules of his art will allow. This is particularly incumbent on him in ſea-engagements, where the ſentence of death is executed as ſoon as pronounced, and the miſerable patient is thrown alive into the ſea, upon the ſurgeon’s declaring his wound to be mortal. There are, beſides, many inſtances on record, where wounds have healed, which the moſt ſkillful ſurgeons have deemed mortal. The following wounds may be reckoned mortal.</p><p>1. Thoſe which penetrate the cavities of the heart, and all thoſe wounds of the viſcera where the large blood-vessels are opened ; becauſe their ſituation will not admit of proper applications to reſtrain the flux of blood.</p><p>2. Thoſe which obſtruct or entirely cut off the paſſage of the nervous influence through the body. Such are wounds of the brain, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, and ſpinal marrow ; though the brain is ſometimes injured, and yet the patient recovers. Wounds likewiſe of the ſmall blood-vessels within the brain are attended with great danger, from the effuſed fluids preſſing upon the brain. Nor is there leſs danger where the nerves which tend to the heart are wounded, or entirely divided ; for, after this, it is impoſſible ſor the heart to continue its motion.</p><p>3. All wounds which entirely deprive the animal of the faculty of breathing.</p><p>4. Thoſe wounds which interrupt thc courſe of the chyle to the heart ; ſuch are wounds of the receptacle of the chyle, thoracic duct, and larger lacteals, &amp;c.</p><p>5. There are other wounds which prove fatal if neglected and left to nature : ſuch are wounds of the larger external blood veſſels, which might be remedied by ligature.</p><p>In examining wounds, the next conſideration is, whether the parts injured are ſuch as may be ſuppoſed to induce dangerous ſymptoms, either immediately or in ſome time during the courſe of the cure. In order to proceed with any degree of certainty, it is necessary to be well acquainted with thoſe ſymptoms which attend injuries of the different parts of the body. If the ſkin only and part of the cellular ſubſtance is divided, the firſt conſequence is an effusion of blood ; the lips of the wound retract, become tumefied, red and inflamed, leaving a gap of conſiderable wideness according to the length and deepneſs of the wound. Beſides, if a very conſiderable portion of ſkin and cellular ſubſtance is divided, a slight fever ſeizes the patient ; the effuſion of blood in the mean time stops, and the wound is partly filled up with a cake of coagulated blood. Below this cake, the ſmall veſſels pour forth a clear liquor, which in a ſhort time is converted into pus (ſee the articles Pus and Mucus). Below this pus granulations of new fleſh ariſe, the cake of coagulated blood looſens, a new ſkin covers the place where the wound was, and the whole is healed up ; only there remains a mark, called a <hi rend="italic">cicatrix</hi> or sc <hi rend="italic">ar,</hi> ſhowing where the injury had been received.</p><p>All wounds are accompanied with a conſiderable degree of pain, eſpecially when the inflammation comes on, though the diviſion reaches no farther than the ſkin and cellular ſubſtance. If the muſcular fibres are divided, the pain is much greater, becauſe the sound part of the muſcle is stretched by the contraction of the divided part and the action of the antagonist muſcle, which it is now leſs fitted to bear. The wound also gaps much more than where the cellular ſubſtance only is divided, inſomuch that, if left to itself, the ſkin will cover the muſcular fibres, without any intervention of cellular ſubſtance ; and not only a very unſightly cicatrix remains, but the uſe of the muſcle is in ſome meaſure lost. — If the muſcle happens to be totally divided, its parts retract to a very conſiderable diſtance ; and unleſs proper methods be taken, the uſe of it is certainly loſt ever afterwards.</p><p>If by a wound any conſiderable artery happens to be divided, the blood flows out with great velocity, and by ſtarts ; the patient ſoon becomes faint with loss of blood ;<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0096.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0090"/>
nor does the hæmorrhagy ſtop until he faints away altogether, when the ends of the divided veſſel cloſe by their natural contractility ; and if as much <hi rend="italic">vis vita</hi> ſtill remains as is sufficient to renew the operations of life, he recovers after ſome time, and the wound heals up as uſual. The part of the artery which is below the wound in the mean time becomes uſeleſs, and its ſides collapſe, ſo that all the inferior part of the limb would be deprived of blood, were it not that the ſmall branches ſent off from the artery above the wounded place become enlarged, and capable of carrying on the circulation. Nature alſo, after a wonderful manner, often produces new veſſels from the ſuperior extremity of the divided artery, by which the circulation is carried on as formerly. However, the conſequences of ſuch a profuſe hæmorrhagy may be very dangerous to the patient, by inducing extreme debility, polypous concretions in the heart and large vessels, or an univerſal dropſy. This happens eſpecially where the artery is partially divided ; becauſe then the veſſel cannot contract in ſuch a manner as to cloſe the orifice : however, if the wound is but ſmall, the blood gets into the cellular ſubſtance, ſwelling up the member to an extreme degree, forming what is called a diff <hi rend="italic">uſed aneuriſm.</hi> Thus the hæmorrhagy ſoon ſtops externally, but great miſchief is apt to flow from the confinement of the extravaſated blood, which is found to have the power of diſſolving not only the fleſhy parts, but alſo the bones themſelves ; and thus not only the uſe of the limb is entirely lost, but the patient is brought into great danger of his life, if proper aſſiſtance be not obtained in a ſhort time.</p><p>Wounds of the ligaments, nerves, and tendons, are likewiſe attended with bad conſequences. When a nerve is entirely divided, the pain is but trifling, though the conſequences are often dangerous. If the nerve is large, all the parts to which it is diſtributed below the wound immediately loſe the power of motion and ſenſation ; nor is it uncommon, in ſuch caſes, for them to be ſeized with a gangrene. This, however, takes place only when all or the greateſt part oſ the nerves belonging to a particular part are divided. If the ſpinal marrow, for inſtance, be divided near the head, the parts below ſoon loſe their action irrecoverably ; or if the bundle of nerves paſſing out of the axilla be divided or tied, ſenſation in the greateſt part of the arm below will probably be lost. But though a nerve ſhould be divided, and a temporary palsy be produced, it may again reunite, and perform its former functions. If a nerve be wounded only, inſtead of being divided, the worſt ſymptoms frequently ensue.</p><p>Wounds which penetrate the cavities of the thorax are always exceedingly dangerous, becauſe there is ſcarce a poſſibility of all the viſcera eſcaping unhurt. A wound is known to have penetrated the cavity of the thorax principally by the diſcharge of air from it at each inſpiration of the patient, by an extreme difficulty of breathing, coughing v.p blood, &amp;c. Such wounds, however, are not always mortal ; the lungs have frequently been wounded, and yet the patient has recovered. —Wounds of the diaphragm are almoſt always mortal, either by inducing fatal convulſions immediately, or by the aſcent of the ſtomach, which the preſſure of the abdominal muſcles forces up through the wound into the cavity of the thorax ; of this Van Swieten gives ſeveral inſtances.— Even though the wound does not penetrate into the cavity of the thorax, the very worſt ſymptoms may follow. For if the wound deſcends deeply among the muſeles, and its orifice lies higher, the extravaſated humours will be therein collected, ſtagnate, and corrupt in ſuch a manner as to form various ſinuſes ; and after having eroded the pleura, it may at length paſs into the cavity of the thorax. The matter having once found a vent into this cavity, will be continually augmenting from the diſcharge of the ſinuous ulcer, and the lungs will at laſt ſuffer by the ſurrounding matter. If, in caſes of wounds in the thorax, the ribs or ſternum happen to become carious, the cure will be extremely tedious and difficult. Galen relates the caſe of a lad who received a blow upon his ſternum in the field of exerciſe : it was firſt neglected, and afterwards badly healed ; but, four months afterwards, matter appeared in the part which had received the blow. A phyſician made an inciſion into the part, and it was ſoon after cicatrized : ſhut in a ſhort time a new collection of matter made its appearance, and upon a ſecond inciſion the wound refuſed to heal. Galen found the ſternum carious ; and having cut off the diſeaſed part, the pericardium itſelf was obſerved to be corroded, ſo that the heart could be ſeen quite naked ; notwithſtanding which, the wound was cured in no very long time.</p><p>There is ſometimes difficulty in determining whether the wound has really penetrated into the thorax or the abdomen ; for the former deſeends much farther towards the ſides than at the middle. But as the lungs are almoſt always wounded when the cavity of the thorax is penetrated, the ſymptoms ariſing from thence can ſcarcely be miſtaken. —Another ſymptom which frequently, though not always, attends wounds of the thorax, is an emphyſema. This is occaſioned by the air eſcaping from the wounded lungs, and inſinuating itſelf into the cellular ſubſtance; which being pervious to it over the whole body, the tumour passes from one part to another, till at laſt every part is inflated to a ſurpriſing degree. An inſtance is given in the Memoirs of the Royal Academy, of a tumour of this kind, which on the thorax was eleven inches thick, on the abdomen nine, on the neck six, and on the rest of the body four ; the eyes were in a great meaſure thruſt out of their orbits by the inflation of the cellular ſubſtance ; and the patient died the fifth day. This was occaſioned by a ſtab with a ſword.</p><p>Wounds of the abdomen are not leſs dangerous than thoſe of the thorax, on account of the importance of the viſcera which are lodged there. When the wound does not penetrate the cavity, there is ſome danger of an hernia being formed by the protruſion of the peritonæum through the weakened integuments, and the danger is greater the larger the wound is. Thoſe wounds which run obliquely betwixt the interstices of the muſcles often produce ſinuous ulcers of a bad kind. For as there is always a large quantity, of fat interpoſed everywhere betwixt the muſcles of the abdomen, if a wound happens to run between them, the extravaſated humours, or matter there collected, not meeting with free egress through the mouth of the wound, often makes its way in a surprising manner through the cellular ſubſtance, and forms deep ſinuoſities between the muſcles in which caſe the cure is always difficult, and ſometimes impoſſible.</p><p>If a large wound penetrates the cavity of the abdomen, ſome of the viſcera will certainly be protruded through it or if the wound is but ſmall, and cloſed up with fat ſo that none of the inteſtines can be protruded, we may know that the cavity of the abdomen is pierced, and probably ſome of the viſcera wounded, by the acute pain and fever, paleneſs, anxiety, faintings, hickcough, cold ſweats, and weakened pulſe, all of which accompany injuries of the internal parts. The miſchiefs which attend wounds of this kind proceed not only ſrom the injury done to the viſcera themſelves, but from the extravaſation of blood and the diſcharge of the contents of the inteſtines into the cavity of the abdomen ;which, being oſ a very putreſcent nature, ſoon bring on the moſt violent diſorders. Hence wounds of the abdominal viſcera are very often mortal. This, however, is not always the caſe, for the ſmall inteſtines have been totally divided,<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0097.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0091"/>
and yet the patient has recovered. Wounds both of the ſmall and large inteſtines have healed ſpontaneouſly, even when they were of ſuch magnitude that the contents of the inteſtine was freely diſcharged through the wound in it, and after part of the inteſtine itſelf has been protruded through the wound of the integuments.</p><p>When the meſentery is injured, the danger is extreme, on account of the numerous vessels and nerves ſituated there. Wounds of the liver, ſpleen, and pancreas, are alſo exceedingly dangerous, although there are ſome inſtances of the ſpleen being cut out of living animals without any conſiderable injury.</p><p>From the preceding account of the ſymptoms attending wounds in the different parts of the body, the ſurgeon may be enabled to judge in ſome meaſure of the event ; though it muſt always be remembered, that wounds, even thoſe which ſeemed to be of the ſlighteſt nature, have, contrary to all expectation, proved mortal, chiefly by inducing convulſions, or a locked jaw ; ſo that no certain prognoſtic can be drawn on sight of recent wounds. We ſhall now, however, proceed to conſider their treatment.</p><p>For the cure of wounds, it has been already obſerved, that the ancients imagined balſams, the juice of herbs, &amp;c. to be a kind of ſpecifics. In after-ages, and in countries where balſams are not eaſily to be procured, ſalves have been ſubſtituted in theſe place ; and even at this day there are many who reckon a ſalve or ointment essentially necessary for healing the slighteſt cut. It is certain, however, that the cure of wounds cannot be effected, nay, not even forwarded in the leaſt, by ointments, unleſs in particular caſes or by accident. That power which the human frame has of repairing the injuries done to itſelf, which by phyſicians is called <hi rend="italic">vis medicatrix natura,</hi> is the ſole agent in curing external injuries ; and without this the moſt celebrated balſams would prove ineffectual. When a wound has been made with a ſharp inſtrument, and is not extenſive, if it be immediately cleaned, and all the extravaſated blood ſucked<note anchored="true" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* See Blood, n⁰ 19.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> out, it will almoſt always heal by the firſt intention in a very ſhort time. Indeed the cures performed by this simple proceſs are ſo ſurpriſing, that they would be incredible were we not aſſured of their reality by eye-witneſſes. When this proceſs is either neglected or proves unſucceſsful, there are three ſtages to be obſerved in the cure of a wound: the firſt, called <hi rend="italic">digestion,</hi> takes place when the ends of the wounded veſſels contract themſelves, and pour out the liquor which is converted into pus. As ſoon as this appears, the ſecond ſtage, in which the fleſh begins to <hi rend="italic">grow up,</hi> takes place ; and as this proceeds, the edges of the wound acquire a fine bluiſh or pearl colour, which is that of the new ſkin beginning to cover the wound as far as the fleſh has filled it up. This proceſs continues, and the ſkin advances from all ſides towards the centre, which is called the <hi rend="italic">cicatrizing</hi> of the wound. For the promoting of each of theſe procesſes, ſeveral ointments were formerly much in vogue. But it is now found, that no ointment whatever is capable of promoting them ; and that it is only neceſſary to keep the wound clean, and to prevent the air from having acceſs to it. This, indeed, nature takes care to do, by covering the wound with a cake of coagulated blood; but if a wound of any conſiderable magnitude ſhould be left entirely to nature, the pus would form below the cruſt of coagulated blood in ſuch quantity, that it would moſt probably corrupt, and the wound degenerate into a corroding ulcer. It is necessary, therefore, to cleanse the wound frequently ; and for this purpoſe it will be proper to apply a little ointment ſpread on ſoſt ſcraped lint. For the firſt dreſſing, dry lint is uſually applied, and ought to be allowed to remain for two or three days, till the pus is perfectly formed ; after which the ointment may be applied as juſt now directed ; and, in a healthy body, the wound will heal without further trouble. As to the ointment employed, it is almoſt indifferent what it be, provided it has no acrid or ſtimulating ingredient in its compoſition.</p><p>But though, in general, wounds thus eaſily admit of a cure, there are ſeveral circumſtances which require a different treatment, even in ſimple diviſions of the fleſhy parts, when neither the membranous nor tendinous parts are injured. Theſe are, 1. Where the wound is large, and gapes very much, ſo that, if allowed to heal in the natural way, the patient might be greatly disfigured by the scar. It is proper to bring the lips of the wound near to each other, and to join them either by adheſive plaſter or by future, as the wound is more ſuperficial, or lies deeper. 2. When foreign bodies are lodged in the wound, as when a cut is given by glaſs, &amp;c. it is neceſſary by all means to extract them, before thc wound is dreſſed ; for it will never heal until they are diſcharged. When theſe bodies are ſituated in ſuch a manner as not to be capable of being extracted without lacerating the adjacent parts, which would occasion violent pain and other bad ſymptoms, it is neceſſary to enlarge the wound, ſo that theſe offending bodies may be eaſily removed. This treatment, however, is chiefly neceſſary in gunſhot wounds, of which we ſhall treat in the next ſection. 3. When the wound is made in ſuch a manner that it runs for ſome length below the ſkin, and the bottom is much lower than the orifice, the matter collected from all parts of the wound will be lodged in the bottom of it, where, corrupting by the heat, it will degenerate into a ſiſtulous ulcer. To prevent this, we muſt uſe compreſſes, applied ſo that the bottom of the wound may ſuffer a more conſiderable preſſure than the upper part of it. Thus the matter formed at the bottom will be gradually forced upwards, and that formed at the upper part will be incapable of deſcending by its weight ; the divided parts, in the mean time, eaſily uniting when brought cloſe together. Indeed, the power which nature has of uniting different parts of the human body is very ſurpriſing ; for, according to authors of credit, even if a piece of fleſh be totally cut out, and applied in a ſhort time afterwards to the place from whence it was cut, the two will unite. That a part, cut out of a living body does not entirely loſe its vital power for ſome time, is evident from the modern practice of tranſplanting teeth ; and from an experiment of Mr Hunter’s at London, he put the teſticle of a cock into the belly of a living hen, which adhered to the liver, and became connected to it by means of blood-vessels<note anchored="true" n="2" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> See an account of the method of fucking wounds in Mr John Bell’s <hi rend="italic">Diſcourſes on Wounds,</hi> Part 1. Diſcourſe v. p. 215.</p></note> *. We have therefore the greateſt reaſon to hope, that the divided parts of the human body, when cloſely applied to each other, will cohere without leaving any ſinus or cavity between them. However, if this method ſhould fail, and matter ſtill be collected in the depending part of the wound, it will be neceſſary to make an opening in that part in order to let it out ; after which the wound may be cured in the common way. 4. During the courſe of the cure, it ſometimes happens that the wound, inſtead of filling up with fleſhy granulations of a florid colour, ſhoots up into a glaſſy like ſubſtance which riſes above the level of the ſurrounding ſkin, while,<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0098.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0092"/>
at the ſame time, inſtead of laudable pus, a thin ill-coloured and fetid ichor is diſcharged. In this caſe the lips of the wound loſe their beautiful pearl colour, and become callous and white, nor does the cicatrizing of the wound at all advance. When this happens in a healthy patient, it generally proceeds from ſome improper management, especially the making uſe of too many emollient and relaxing medicines, an immoderate uſe of balſams and ointments. Frequently nothing more is requisite for taking down this fungus than dreſſing with dry lint ; at other times deſiccative powders, ſuch as calamine, tutty, calcined alum, &amp;c. will be necessary ; and ſometimes red precipitate mercury muſt be uſed. This laſt, however, is apt to give great pain, if ſprinkled in its dry ſtate upon the wound ; it is therefore moſt proper to grind it with ſome yellow baſilicon ointment, which makes a much more gentle, though at the ſame time an efficacious escharotic. Touching the overgrown parts with blue vitriol is alſo found very effectual.</p><p>Hitherto we have conſidered the wounded patient as otherwiſe in a ſtate of perfect health ; but it muſt be obſerved, that a large wound is capable of diſordering the ſyſtem to a great degree, and inducing dangerous diſeaſes which did not before exiſt.— If the patient is ſtrong and vigorous, and the pain and inflammation of the wound great, a conſiderable degree of fever may ariſe, which it will be neceſſary to check by bleeding, low diet, and other parts of the antiphlogiſtſe regimen, at the ſame that the inflamed lips of the wound and parts adjacent are to be treated with emollient fomentations or cataplaſms till the pain and swelling abate. On the other hand, it may happen, when the patient is of a weak and lax habit, that the vis vitæ may not be ſufficient to excite ſuch an inflammation in the wound as is abſolutely necessary for its cure. In this caſe, the edges of the wound look pale and soft ; the wound itſelf ichorous and bloody, without any ſigns of fleshy granulations ; or if any new fleſh shoots up, it is of the fungous glassy kind above-mentioned. To ſuch wounds all external applications are vain ; it is neceſſary to ſtrengthen the patient by proper internal remedies, among which the bark has a principal place, until the wound begins to alter its appearance. In ſuch persons, too, there is ſome danger of a hectic fever by the abſorption of matter into the body when the wound is large ; and this will take place during the courſe of the cure, even when the appearances have been at firſt as favourable as could be wiſhed. This happens generally when the wound is large, and a great quantity of matter formed : for by this diſcharge the patient is weakened ; ſo that the pus is no ſooner formed, than it is by the abſorbent veſſels re-conveyed into the body, and feveriſh heats immediately affect the patient. For this the beſt remedy is to exhibit the bark copiouſly, at the ſame time ſupporting the patient by proper cordials and nouriſhing diet. Indeed, in general, it will be found, that, in the caſe of wounds of any conſiderable magnitude, a more full and nouriſhing regimen is required than the patient, even in health, has been accuſtomed to ; for the diſcharge of pus alone, where the quantity is conſiderable, proves very debilitating, if the patient is not ſtrengthened by proper diet. And it is conſtantly found, that the cure of inch sores goes on much more eaſily when the patient is kept in his usual habit of body, than when his ſyſtem is much emaciated by a very low allowance ; and, for the ſame reaſon, purgatives, and whatever elſe tends to weaken the conſtitution, are improper in the cure of wounds.</p><p>Hæmorrhagies very frequently happen in wounds, either from a diviſion of one large artery, or of a number of shall ones. In this caſe, the firſt ſtep to be taken by the ſurgeon is to effect a temporary ſtoppage of the blood by means of compreſſion. He is then to tie up all the veſſels in the manner to be afterwards deſcribed.</p><p>When the principal arteries of a wound have been tied, and a little blood continues to be diſcharged, but appears to come from sundry ſmall veſſels only, an experienced ſurgeon is induced to think, that the neceſſary compreſſion of the bandages will in all probability effect a total ſtoppage of the hæmorrhagy. In a general oozing of a ſmall quantity of blood from the whole ſurface of a sore, and when no particular veſſel can be diſtinguiſhed, there is a neceſſity for truſting to this remedy; but whenever an artery can be discovered, of whatever ſize it may be, it ought unqueſtionably to be ſecured by a ligature. But it frequently happens, that conſiderable quantities of blood are diſcharged, not from any particular veſſel, but from all the ſmall arteries over the ſurface of the ſore. In wounds of great extent, particularly after the extirpation of cancerous breaſts, and in other operations where extensive sores are left, this ſpecies of hæmorrhagy often proves very troubleſome by being exceedingly difficult to ſuppreſs.</p><p>Bleedings oſ this kind seem evidently to proceed from two very different and oppoſite cauſes. F <hi rend="italic">irst,</hi> Either from too great a quantity of blood contained in the veſſels, or from an over degree oſ tone in the veſſels themſelves; or, perhaps, from a combination of both theſe cauſes. But, <hi rend="italic">ſecondly,</hi> Such evacuations undoubtedly happen moſt frequently in ſuch conſtitutions as are very relaxed and debilitated ; either from a particular ſtate of the blood, or from a want of tone in the containing veſſels, or, in ſome inſtances, from a concurrence of both.</p><p>In conſtitutions perfectly healthy, on the occurrence of wounds even of the moſt extenſive nature, as ſoon as the larger arteries are ſecured, all the ſmall vessels which have been divided are diminiſhed, not only in their diameters, but alſo in their length; in conſequence of which, they recede conſiderably within the ſurface of the ſurrounding parts. This cauſe oſ itſelf would probably, in the greateſt number of inſtances, prove ſufficient for reſtraining all loſs of blood from the smaller arteries. Another very powerful agent however is provided by nature for producing the same effect. From the extremities of the divided veſſels which at firſt diſcharged red blood only, there now, in their contracted ſtate, oozes out a more thin, though viſcid fluid, containing a great proportion of the coagulable parts of the blood; and this being equally diſtributed over the ſurface of the wound, by its balsamic agglutinating powers has a very conſiderable influence in reſtraining all ſuch hæmorrhagies.</p><p>When a tedious oozing occurs in a patient young and vigorous, and where the tone of the muſcular fibres is evidently great, the moſt effectual means of putting a stop to the diſcharge is to relax the vascular ſyſtem, either by opening a vein in ſome other part, or, what gives ſtill more immediate relief, by untying the ligature on one of the principal arteries of the part, ſo as to allow it to bleed freely : thoſe violent ſpasſmodic twitchings too, ſo frequent after operations on any of the extremities, when they do not depend on a nerve being included in the ligature with the artery, are in this manner more effectually relieved than by any other means.</p><p>By the ſame means the patient, from being in a febrile heat and much confused, ſoon becomes very tranquil : the violent puliation of the heart and larger arteries abates, and the blood not being propelled with ſuch impetuoſity into the smaller veſſels of the part, they are thereby left at more liberty to retract. In the mean time the patient ought to be kept exceedingly cool ; wine and other cordials ſhould be rigidly avoided ; cold water, acidulated either with the mine<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0099.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0093"/>
ral or vegetable acids, ought to be the only drink ; motion of every kind, particularly of the part affected, ſhould be guarded againſt ; and the wound being gently covered with ſoft charpie, ought to be tied up with a bandage ſo applied as to produce a moderate degree of preſſure on the extremities of the divided parts.</p><p>As ſoon as a sufficient quantity of blood has been diſcharged, the wound being dreſſed, and the patient laid to reſt, a doſe of opium proportioned to the violence of the ſymptoms ought to be immediately exhibited. It ought to be remarked, however, that in all ſuch circumſtances, much larger doſes of the remedy are neceſſary than in ordinary caſes requiring the uſe of opiates. Small doſes, inſtead of answering any good purpoſe, ſeem frequently rather to aggravate the various ſymptoms ; ſo that whenever they are here had recourſe to, they ought always to be given in quantities ſufficient for the intended effect.</p><p>But hæmorrhagies of this nature happen much more frequently in relaxed enfeebled habits, where the ſolids have loſt part of their natural firmneſs, and the fluids have acquired a morbid tenuity. In this caſe a moderate uſe of generous wine ought to be immediately prescribed ; for nothing tends ſo much, in ſuch circumſtances, to reſtrain hæmorrhagies, as a well directed uſe of proper cordials. By tending to invigorate and brace the ſolids, they enable the arterial ſyſtem to give a due reſiſtance to the contained fluids ; and have alſo a conſiderable influence in reſtoring to the fluids that viſcidity of texture, of which in all ſuch inſtances we ſuppoſe them to be deprived.</p><p>A nouriſhing diet alſo becomes proper ; the patient ought to be kept cool ; and the mineral acids, from their known utility in every ſpecies of hæmorrhagy, ought alſo to be prescribed. Reſt of body is here alſo proper ; and opiates, when indicated either by pain or ſpaſmodic affections of the muſcles, ought never to be omitted.</p><p>Together with theſe remedies adapted to the general ſyſtem, particular dreſſings, appropriated to the ſtate of the parts to which they are to be applied, have been found very beneficial. In healthy conſtitutions, ſoon after the diſcharge of blood is over, the parts are covered with a viſcid coagulable effuſion from the mouths of the now retracted arteries ; but in conſtitutions of an oppoſite nature, where the solids are much relaxed, the blood in general is found in ſuch an attenuated ſtate as to afford no ſecretion of this nature.</p><p>To ſupply as much as poſſible the deficiency of this natural balſam, different artificial applications have been invented. Duſting the part with ſtarch or wheat-flour has ſometimes been ſound of uſe, and gum arabic in fine powder has been known to anſwer when theſe failed.</p><p>Applications of this kind, indeed, have been uſed with ſucceſs in all ſuch hæmorrhagies, with whatever habit of body they happen to be connected ; but they have always proved more particularly ſerviceable in relaxed conſtitutions, attended with an attenuated ſtate of the blood and an enfeebled muſcular ſyſtem. Alcohol, or any other ardent ſpirits, impregnated with as great a quantity as they can diſſolve of mirrh, or any other of the heating viſcid gums, may be here uſed with freedom, though in conſtitutions of an oppoſite nature they ought never to be employed. The balsamum traumaticum of the shops, a remedy of this nature, has long been famous for its influence in ſuch caſes: but that indiſcriminate uſe of this and ſimilar applications which has long prevailed with ſome practitioners, has undoubtedly done much harm ; for as they are all poſſeſſed of very ſtimulating powers, they of courſe tend to aggravate every ſymptom in wounds connected with a tenſe ſtate of fibres, when much pain, and eſpecially when ſpaſmodic muſcular affections prevail.</p><p>By a due perſeverance in one or other of the plans here pointed out, it will ſeldom happen that hæmorrhagies of this nature are not at laſt put a ſtop to : but when the contrary does occur, when, notwithstanding the uſe of the remedies recommended, a diſcharge of blood ſtill continues; together with the means already adviſed, an equal moderate pressure ought to be applied over the whole ſurface of the sore, to be continued as long as the neceſſity of the caſe ſeems to indicate.</p><p>In finiſhing the dreſſings of ſuch wounds, after the charpie and compreſſes have been applied, a bandage properly adapted to the part ought to conclude the whole, and in ſuch a manner as to produce as equal a degree of pressure over the ſurface of the sore as poſſible. But it now and then happens that no bandage whatever can be ſo applied as to produce the desired effect ; and in ſuch caſes the hand of an aſſiſtant is the only reſource ; which being firmly applied over the dreſſings, ſo as to produce a very equal degree of preſſure, will commonly ſucceed when no other remedy is found to have much influence.</p><p>Wounds of the nerves, tendons, and ligaments, are attended with much more violent ſymptoms than thoſe where even conſiderable arteries are divided, and frequently reſiſt every method of cure propoſed by the moſt ſkilful practitioners. In the simple proceſs of blood-letting, it frequently happens that the tendinous expanſion called the <hi rend="italic">aponeuroſis</hi> of the biceps muſcle is wounded, or even the tendon of that muſcle itſelf is punctured, by the point of the lancet ; or ſometimes a nerve which happens to lie in the neighbourhood is partially divided. Any one of theſe wounds, though they are the smalleſt we can well ſuppoſe to be given, are frequently very dangerous and difficult of cure. It ſometimes immediately happens on the introduction of the lancet, that the patient complains of a moſt exquiſite degree of pain ; and when this occurs, we may reſt aſſured that either a nerve or tendon has been wounded. On ſome occaſions, by proper management, ſuch as evacuating a conſiderable quantity of blood at the orifice newly made, by keeping the part at perfect reſt, and preſerving the patient in as cool a ſtate as poſſible, the pain at firſt complained of will gradually abate, and at laſt go off entirely, without any bad conſequence whatever. At other times, however, this pain which occurs inſtantaneouſly on the introduction of the lancet, inſtead of abating, begins ſoon to increaſe ; a fullneſs, or ſmall degree of ſwelling, takes place in the parts contiguous to the wound ; the lips of the sore become ſomewhat hard and inflamed ; and, in the courſe of 24 hours or ſo from the operation, a thin watery ferum begins to be diſcharged at the orifice.</p><p>If, by the means employed, relief is not ſoon obtained, theſe ſymptoms generally continue in nearly the same ſtate for two or perhaps three days longer. At this time the violent pain which at firſt took place becomes ſtill more distreſſing ; but inſtead of being ſharp and acute as before, it is now attended with the ſenſation of a burning heat, which ſtill goes on to increaſe, and proves, during the whole courſe of the ailment, a ſource of constant diſtreſs to the patient. The fullneſs and hardneſs in the lips of the wound begin to increaſe, and the ſwelling in the neighbouring parts gradually extends over the whole members. The parts at laſt become exceedingly tenſe and hard; an eryſipelatous inflammatory colour frequently appears over the whole member ; the pulſe by this time has generally become very hard and quick ; the pain is now intense, the patient exceedingly reſtleſs ; twitchings of the tendons oc<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0100.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0094"/>
cur to a greater or lesser degree ; on ſome occaſions, a locked jaw and other convulſive affections ſupervene ; and all theſe ſymptoms continuing to increaſe, it moſt frequently happens that the torture under which the patient has been groaning is at laſt terminated by death.</p><p>Different opinions have prevailed reſpecting the cauſe of theſe ſymptoms. By ſome they have been imputed to wounds of the tendons. By others the tendons are ſuppoſed to be ſo entirely deſtitute of ſenſibility, as to be quite incapable of producing ſo much diſtreſs ; ſo that wounds of the nerves they conſider, on all ſuch occaſions, as the true cauſe of the various ſymptoms we have mentioned.</p><p>One or other oſ theſe ideas continued to be the only ſource for explaining the various phenomena found to occur in this malady, till a different opinion was ſuggeſted by the late ingenious Mr John Hunter of London. Mr Hunter ſuppoſes, that all the dreadful ſymptoms found now and then to be induced by the operation of blood-letting, may be more readily accounted for from an inflamed ſtate of the internal ſurface of the vein, than from any other cauſe. Such a ſtate of the vein he has often traced in horſes that have died of ſuch ſymptoms from veneſection, and the ſame appearances have ſometimes occurred alſo in the human body. And on other occaſions, inflammation having in this manner been once excited, has been known to terminate in ſuppuration ; and the matter thus produced being in the courſe of circulation carried to the heart, Mr Hunter ſuppoſes that in ſuch caſes death may have been induced by that cauſe alone.</p><p>There can be no reaſon to doubt the fact held forth by Mr Hunter, that in ſuch inſtances the vein in which the orifice has been made has frequently after death been found greatly inflamed : but however ingenious his arguments may be for concluding that the ſtate of the vein is the original cauſe of all the bad ſymptoms enumerated, and although we muſt allow that ſuch an inflammatory affection of a vein muſt have a conſiderable influence in aggravating the various ſymptoms previouſly induced by other cauſes ; yet we may very fairly conclude, that it could not probably in any one inſtance be able to account with ſatisfaction for their firſt production.</p><p>In many inſtances the patient, at the very inſtant of the operation, feels a very unuſual degree of pain. In ſome caſes, the violence of the pain is almoſt unſupportable. Now this we can never ſuppoſe to have been produced by the mere puncture of a vein; for although the coats of veins are not perhaps entirely deſtitute of feeling, yet we know well that they are not endowed with ſuch a degree of ſenſibility as to render it probable ſuch intenſe pain could ever be induced by their being punctured in any way whatever. This inflamed ſtate of the veins therefore, as detected by Mr Hunter after death, muſt be conſidered rather as being produced by, than as being productive of, ſuch affections; and that ſuch ailments ſhould frequently produce an inflammation of the contiguous veins, is a very probable conjecture. In the courſe of 48 hours or ſo from the operation, when the febrile ſymptoms are juſt commencing, ſuch a degree of hardneſs and evident inflammation is induced over all the parts contiguous to the orifice, that it would be ſurpriſing indeed if the vein, which is thus perhaps entirely ſurrounded with parts highly inflamed, ſhould eſcape altogether. We ſhall therefore proceed upon the ſuppoſition of this inflamed ſtate of the veins being a conſequence rather than the cauſe of ſuch ailments ; and of courſe we now revert to one or other of the opinions long ago adopted on this ſubject, that all the train of bad ſymptoms found on ſome occaſions to Succeed veneſection, proceeds either from the wound of a nerve or of a tendon.</p><p>That a partial wound of a nerve will now and then produce very diſtreſſing ſymptoms, no practitioner will deny : but it has been attempted to be ſhown, that tendons are almoſt totally deſtitute of ſenſibility ; and it has therefore been ſuppoſed, that their being wounded can never account for the various ſymptoms known to occur in ſuch caſes. There is great reaſon however to think, that in different inſtances the ſame train of ſymptoms have been induced by different cauſes ; that in one inſtance a wounded nerve, and in others pricks of the tendons, have given riſe to them, as we have already ſuppoſed.</p><p>In order to prevent as much as poſſible the conſequent inflammation and other ſymptoms which usually enſue, a conſiderable quantity of blood ſhould be immediately diſcharged at the orifice juſt made : the limb, for ſeveral days at leaſt, ought to be kept in a ſtate of perfect reſt, care being at the ſame time taken to keep the muſeles of the part in as relaxed a ſtate as poſſible : the patient ſhould be kept cool ; on a low diet ; and, if neceſſary, gentle laxatives ought to be adminiſtered.</p><p>When, notwithſtanding theſe means, the ſymptoms, inſtead of diminiſhing, rather become more violent ; if the lips of the orifice turn hard and more inflamed, if the pain becomes more conſiderable, and eſpecially if the ſwelling begins to ſpread, other remedies come then to be indicated. In this ſtate of the complaint, topical blood-letting, by means of leeches applied as near as poſſible to the lips of the wound, frequently affords much relief ; and when the pulſe is full and quick, it even becomes neceſſary to evacuate large quantities of blood by opening a vein in ſome other part.</p><p>The external applications uſually employed in this ſtate of the complaint are warm emollient fomentations and poultices. In ſimilar affections of other parts no remedies with which we are acquainted would probably be found more ſucceſsful ; but in the complaint now under conſideration, all ſuch applications, inſtead of being productive of any advantage, rather do harm. The heat of the part is here one of the moſt diſtreſſing ſymptoms ; and warm emollient applications rather tend to augment this ſource of uneaſineſs. The lips of the wound alſo are rendered still more hard, ſwelled, and of courſe more painful ; and the ſwelling of the contiguous parts is increaſed. The best external remedies are cooling aſtringents, eſpecially the ſaturnine applications. The parts chiefly affected being alternately covered over with cloths wet with a ſolution of ſaccharum ſaturni, and pledgits ſpread with Goulard’s cerate, are kept more cool and eaſy than by any other remedy hitherto uſed. The febrile ſymptoms which occur muſt at the ſame time be attended to, by keeping the patient cool, on a low diet, preſerving a lax ſtate of the bowels ; and, if neceſſary, farther quantities of blood ought to be evacuated.</p><p>On account of the violence of the pain, which is ſometimes ſo exceſſive as to deſtroy entirely the patient’s reſt, opiates ought to be freely exhibited ; and when twitchings of the tendons and other convulſive ſymptoms ſuperveae, medicines of this kind become ſtill more neceſſary. In order, however, to have a proper influence in this ſtate of the complaint, opiates ought to be given in very full doſes ; otherwiſe, inſtead of answering any good purpoſe, they conſtantly tend to aggravate the different ſymptoms, not only by increaſing the heat and reſtleſſness, but by having an evident influence in rendering the ſyſtem more ſuſceptible than it was before of the pain and other diſtreſſing effects produced upon it by the wound.</p><p>It often happens, however, either from neglecting the wound or from improper treatment, that all theſe remedies are had recourſe to without any advantage whatever : the fever, pain,<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0101.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0095"/>
and ſwelling of the parts continuing, convulſive affections of the muſcles at laſt occur, all tending to indicate the moſt imminent danger. In this ſituation of matters, if we have not immediate recourſe to ſome effectual means, the patient will ſoon fall a victim to the diſorder ; and the only remedy from which much real advantage is to be expected, is a free and extenſive diviſion of the parts in which the orifice producing all the miſchief was at firſt made. We know well, from the repeated experience of ages, that much more pain and diſtreſs of every kind is commonly produced by the partial diviſion either of a nerve or of a tendon, than from any of theſe parts being at once cut entirely acroſs. Now the intention of the operation here recommended, is to produce a complete diviſion of the nerve or tendon we ſuppoſe to have been wounded by the point of the lancet, and which we conſider as the ſole cauſe of all the ſubſequent diſtreſs.</p><p>This operation being attended with a good deal of pain, and being put in practice for the removal of ſymptoms from which it is perhaps difficult to perſuade the patient that much danger can occur, all the remedies we have mentioned should be firſt made trial of before it is propoſed : but at the ſame time, care ought to be taken that the diſorder is not allowed to proceed too far before we have recourſe to it ; for if the patient ſhould be previouſly much weakened by the feveriſh ſymptoms having continued violent for any length of time, neither this remedy nor any other with which we are acquainted would probably have much influence. So ſoon therefore as the courſe already preſcribed has been fairly tried, and is found to be inadequate to the effects expected from it, we ought immediately to have recourſe to a free diviſion of the parts chiefly affected.</p><p>Wherever a wounded or ruptured tendon may be ſituated, the limb ſhould be placed in ſuch a manner as will moſt readily admit of the retracted ends of the tendon being brought nearly together ; and when in this ſituation, the muſcles of the whole limb in which the injury has happened muſt be tied down with a roller, ſo as to prevent them from all kinds of exertion during the cure, endeavouring at the ſame time to keep the parts eaſy and relaxed. Thus in a wound or rupture of the tendon of the rectus muſcle of the thigh, the patient’s <hi rend="italic">leg</hi> ſhould be kept as much as poſſible ſtretched out during the cure, while the thigh ſhould be in ſome degree bent, to relax the muſcle itſelf as far as poſſible.</p><p>In ſimilar affections of the tendo Achillis, the <hi rend="italic">knee</hi> ſhould be kept conſtantly bent to relax the muſcles of the leg, and the foot ſhould be ſtretched out to admit of the ends of the ruptured tendon being brought nearly into contact. A roller ſhould be applied with a firmneſs quite ſufficient for ſecuring the muſcles and tendons in this ſituation ; but care muſt be taken to prevent it from impeding the circulation. With this view, fine ſoft flannel ſhould be preferred either to linen or cotton ; for being more elaſtic, it more readily yields to any ſwelling with which the limb may be attacked.</p><p>The late Dr Monro was the firſt who gave any accurate directions for the treatment of rupture in the large tendons; and it is perhaps given with more precision, from his having himſelf experienced the effects of this misfortune in the tendo Achillis.</p><p>He uſed a foot-ſock or flipper, made of double quilted ticking, and left open at the toe ; from the heel of which a ſtrap went up above the calf of the leg. A ſtrong piece of the ſame materials went round the calf, and was fastened with a lace. On the back part of this was a buckle, through which the ſtrap of the foot-ſock was paſſed, by which the calf could be brought down, and the foot extended at pleaſure. Beſides there was a piece of tin applied to the fore part of the leg, to prevent the foot from getting into any improper posture during sleep. After propoſing to walk, he put on a ſhoe with a heel two inches deep ; and it was not till the expiration of five months that he ventured today aside the tin plate ; and he continued the uſe of the high heeled ſhoe for two years. The whole apparatus is repreſented Plate CCCCXCII. fig. 124.</p><p>From this treatment a knowledge may be formed of the treatment necessary to be followed in the laceration of tendons of other parts of the body.</p><p>In wounds of the thorax, even though none of the viſcera ſhould be wounded, we may yet reaſonably expect that a conſiderable quantity of blood will be extravaſated ; and this, if very large, muſt be evacuated if poſſible. However, it ought to be particularly obſerved, that this extravaſated blood ſhould not be diſcharged before we are assured that the wounded veſſels have done bleeding. When the pulſe appears ſufficiently ſtrong and equal, the extremities are warm, no hickup or convulſion appears, and the patient’s ſtrength continues, we may then know that the internal hæmorrhagy has ceaſed, and that the means for diſcharging the blood may now be ſafely uſed. Matter, water, blood, &amp;c. have ſometimes vaniſhed from the cavities oſ the thorax, and been afterwards diſeharged by ſweat, urine, &amp;c. Yet this but ſeldom happens ; and if we were to truſt to nature only in theſe caſes, it is certain that many would periſh from a deſtruction of the vital viſcera by the extravaſated and putrid blood, who by an artificial extraction of the same, blood might have been ſaved.</p><p>Wounds of the abdomen muſt be cloſed as ſoon as poſſible, and then treated as simple wounds; only they ought to be dressed as ſeldom and expeditiouſly as may be. A ſpare diet, with other parts of the antiphlogistic regimen, is here abſolutely neceſſary. It ſometimes happens, that, thro’ a large wound of the abdominal integuments, the inteſtine comes out without being injured ; yet, if it remains for any time expoſed to the air, the caſe is commonly very dangerous. The moſt certain method, in all ſuch caſes, is to return the protruded part as ſoon as poſſible ; ſor although writers in general formerly recommended warm fomentations, &amp;c. to be previouſly applied, the lateſt authors upon this ſubject conſider the moſt natural and proper fomentation to be that which is produced by the heat and moiſture oſ the patient’s belly, and that therefore the inteſtines, if no mortification has taken place, are to be cleared from extraneous matter, and immediately returned.</p><p>When the wound of the abdomen is large, the inteſtines eaſily prolapſe, but are as eaſily returned. But when part of an inteſtine has been forced through a narrow wound, the diſorder is much more dangerous; For the prolapſed. inteſtine being distended by flatus, or the ingeſted aliments driven thither by the peristatic motion, it will be inflamed, tumefied, and incapable of being returned through the stricture of the wound ; whence a stoppage of the circulation and gangrene will ſoon follow. In this caſe the utmoſt care, is to be taken to reduce the inteſtine to its natural ſize. When this cannot be accompliſhed by other means, ſome practitioners of great eminence have even adviſed the puncturing of the inteſtine in different places in order to diſcharge the slatus. This practice has alſo been recommended in an incarcerated hernia, but is exceedingly diſapproved of by Mr Pott and later writers ; and it ſeems to be very dubious whether any good can poſſibly ariſe from it. To puncture any part that is already inflamed, must undoubtedly add to the inflammation ; and it is very improbable that<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0102.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0096"/>
the diſcharge of slatus procured by the punctures would at all be a recompenſe for the bad conſequences produced by the increaſed inflammation. The method of Celſus is much more eligible : It is to dilate the wound ſo as <hi rend="italic">to</hi> reduce the inteſtine with eaſe. Sometimes part of the inteſtine is loſt either by ſuppuration or gangrene. In this caſe, all that can be done is to ſtrike a ſingle ſtitch through the wounded bowel, and to six it to the external wound by paſſing the suture alſo through the ſides of the wound. The ends of the inteſtine may perhaps adhere ; or at any rate the wound will continue to perform the office of an anus, out of which the faeces will continue to be diſcharged during life. The directions given by ſome ſurgeons about inſerting the upper end of the gut into the lower, and stitching them together, are perfectly impracticable, as Mr John Bell has ſhown in his important Diſcourſes on Wounds<note anchored="true" n="3" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Part II. Discourses 4th and 5th.</p></note> * ; and even if they were practicable, would certainly produce new mortification, which could not but be fatal.</p><p>When the omentum appears prolapſed, the ſame general treatment is to be obſerved ; only that, when it is dry and mortified, the dead part may ſafely be extirpated.—We ſhall conclude the article of abdominal wounds with a caſe from the memoirs of the academy of ſciences for the year 1705, which ſhows that we ought not to deſpair, even though the moſt deſperate ſymptoms ſhould take place, as long as any vis vitæ remains. A madman wounded himſelf in 18 different places oſ the abdomen. Eight of theſe penetrated the cavity, and injured the contained viſcera ; he had a diarrhoea, nauſea, and vomiting, tenſion of the abdomen, with difficult reſpiration and violent fever, ſo that his life was deſpaired of. During the firſt four days he was blooded ſeven times ; and during the greateſt part of the cure his diet conſiſted almoſt entirely of fleſh-broths, with the addition of ſome mild vegetables. By theſe means he was not only cured of his wounds, but reſtored to his right ſenſes. Seventeen months after, he went mad again, and threw himſelf over a precipice, by which he was inſtantly killed : on opening the body, the wounds were found to have penetrated the middle lobe of the liver, the inteſtinum jejunum, and the colon.</p><p>Such extraordinary cures are to be imputed, according to the ſatisfactory explanation of Mr J. Bell, to the abdomen being perfectly full, and conſtantly ſubjected to ſtrong preſſure between the diaphragm and abdominal muſcles ; which keeps the parts contiguous to a wound closely applied to it, prevents the diſcharge of fæces or even of blood in ſome meaſure, and gives an opportunity for a very ſpeedy adhesion between the parts.</p><p>In wounds of the head, where the cellular membrane only is affected, and the aponeuroſis and pericranium untouched, phlebotomy, lenient purges, and the uſe of the common febrifuge medicines, particularly thoſe of the neutral kind, generally remove all the threatening ſymptoms. When the inflammation is gone off, it leaves on the ſkin a yellowiſh tint and a dry ſcurf, which continue until perſpiration takes them away ; and upon the removal of the diſeaſe, the wound immediately recovers a healthy aſpect, and ſoon heals without further trouble. But in the worſt kind of theſe wounds, that is, where a ſmall wound passes through the tela celluloſa and aponeuroſis to the pericranium, the patient will admit of more free evacuations by phlebotomy than in the former. In both, the uſe of warm fomentations is required ; but an emollient cataplaſm, which is generally forbid in the cryſipelatous dwellings, may in this latter caſe be uſed to great advantage. Where the ſymptoms are not very preſsing, nor the habit very inflammable, this method will prove ſufficient ; but it ſometimes happens that the ſcalp is ſo tenſe, the pain ſo great, and the symptomatic fever ſo high, that by waiting for the slow effect of ſuch means the patient runs a riſk from the continuance of the fever ; or else the injured aponeuroſis and pericranium, becoming ſloughy, produce an abſceſs, and render the caſe both tedious and troubleſome. A diviſion of the wounded part, by a simple inciſion down to the bone, about half an inch or an inch in length, will moſt commonly remove all the bad ſymptoms ; and if it be done in time, will render every thing elſe unneceſſary.</p><p>The wounds penetrating into the cavities of the joints do not ſeem at firſt alarming ; yet, by expoſure to the air, the lining membrane of ſuch cavities acquire ſuch a degree of ſenſibility as to endanger life when they are large. As ſoon therefore as any extraneous body, puſhed into the joint, is removed, the admiſſion of the external air is to be guarded against as much as poſſible. If the wound be not too large, this may be done by pulling the ſkin over the wound of the joint ; and, to prevent its retraction, rather adheſive plaſter, with proper bandaging, is to be uſed. But when inflammation is come on, repeated and copious blood-letting, together with fomentations, become neceſſary ; and as the pain, in theſe caſes, is apt to be violent, opiates muſt be adminiſtered ; but ſhould matter be formed in the cavity of the joint, free vent muſt be give to it.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Of contuſed and lacerated Wounds.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">When</hi> the ſmall veſſels arc broken by a blow with any hard inſtrument without penetrating the ſkin, at the ſame time that the ſolid fibres of the part are cruſhed, the injury is termed a <hi rend="italic">contusion :</hi> and when at the ſame time the ſkin is broken, it is termed a <hi rend="italic">contuſed and lacerated wound ;</hi> becauſe in this caſe the parts are not fairly divided as with a knife, but torn aſunder or violently ſtretched.</p><p>Every contuſion therefore, whether the ſkin is broken or not, may properly be reckoned a wound ; for where the injury is ſo slight that none of the contents of the ſmall veſſels are extravaſated, it ſcarce deferves to be mentioned. The immediate conſequence of a contuſion, therefore, is a ſwelling, by reaſon of the extravaſation juſt mentioned ; and the ſkin becomes diſcoloured by the blood ſtagnating under it : but as this fluid, even though covered by the ſkin, cannot long remain in its natural ſtate, it thence happens, that the contuſed part ſoon loses its florid red colour, and becomes blue or black ; the thinner parts being in the mean time gradually taken up by the abſorbent veſſels, which at laſt happens to the blood itſelf; the blue diſappears, and is ſucceeded by a yellowiſh colour, showing that the blood is now diſſolved ; after which the part recovers its former appearance, and the ruptured veſſels appear to have united as though nothing had happened.</p><p>Theſe are the ſymptoms which attend the slighteſt kind of contuſions ; but it is evident, that where the blow is ſo violent as to rupture or cruſh ſome of the large nerves, or blood-veſſels, all the bad conſequences which attend ſimple wounds of thoſe parts will enſue, and they will not at all be alleviated by the circumſtance of the ſkin being whole. Hence it is eaſy to ſee how a contuſion may produce ulcers of the worſt kind, gangrene, ſphacelus, carious bones, &amp;c. ; and if it happens to be on a glandular part, a ſcirrhus or cancer is very frequently found to enſue. Even the viſcera themſelves, eſpecially of the abdomen, may be injured by contuſions to ſuch a degree as to produce an inflammation, gangrene, or ſcirrhus, nay inſtant death, without rupturing the ſkin.<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0103.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0097"/>
<hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Of Gun-shot Wounds.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gun-shot</hi> wounds can be conſidered in no other light than contuſed wounds. In thoſe made by a muſket or piſtol ball, the moſt immediate considerations are, to extract the ball, or any other extraneous body which may have lodged in the wounded part ; and to ſtop the hemorrhagy, if there is an effuſion of blood from the rupture of ſome conſiderable artery.</p><p>It is frequently neceſſary to enlarge the wound in order to extract the ball ; and it it has gone quite through, (provided the ſituation of the part wounded will admit of its being done with ſafety), the wound is to be laid freely open through its whole length ; by which means any extraneous body will be more readily removed, and the cure facilitated.</p><p>Tn order to get at the ball, or any other foreign matter, probing is to be uſed as ſparingly as poſſible : and this muſt evidently appear to any one who will only conſider the nature of the ſymptoms attendant on penetrating wounds of the breaſt or belly, either from a bullet or fharp inſtrument; the thruſting in a probe to parts under ſuch circumſtances being unavoidably a freſh ſtab on every repetition of ſuch practice. Wherever probing is neceſſary, the finger is to be preferred as the best and trueſt probe, where it can be uſed.</p><p>If a ball, or any other foreign body, happens to be lodged near the orifice, or can be perceived by the finger to lie under the ſkin, though at ſome diſtance from the mouth of the wound, we ſhould cut upon it and take it out : but when it is ſunk deep, and lies abſolutely beyond the reach of the finger, it muſt appear evident, upon the leaſt reflection, that thruſting, firſt a long probe in queſt of the bullet, and then, as has been practiſed likewiſe, a longer pair of forceps, either with or without teeth, into a wound of that kind, though with a sort of certainty to extract it, muſt either contuſe, or irritate and inflame, the parts to a great degree; and conſequently do as much, or more miſchief, than the ball did at firſt by forcing its paſſage ſuch a length of way. And ſhould they at the ſame time lay hold of any conſiderable artery or nerve along with the ball (which can ſcarce ever fail of being the case), what ſhocking conſequences would attend ſuch a proceeding ! Nor would attempts of this sort be leſs injurious in caſe a bullet ſhould happen to be lodged in the cavity of the belly or breaſt. Such attempts are the leſs necessary, becauſe a great number of inſtances have occurred, where balls have been quietly lodged in ſeveral parts of the body, till after many years they have worked themſelves a paſſage towards the ſurface, and were very eaſily extracted ; and many where balls have been entirely left behind.</p><p>In caſe the wound be occaſioned by a muſket or piſtol ſhot, and of courſe but ſmall, it will be neceſſary to dilate it without delay, provided the nature of the part will admit of this with ſafety: for in wounds near a joint, or in very membranous or tendinous parts, the knife, as well as forceps, ſhould be put under ſome reſtraint ; nor ſhould any more opening be made than what is abſolutely requiſite for the free diſcharge ot the matter lodged within.</p><p>Where the wounded perſon has not ſuffered any great loss of blood, and this is generally the caſe, it will be adviſable to open a vein immediately, and take from the arm a large quantity ; and to repeat bleeding as circumſtances may require, the second, and even the third day. Repeated bleedings in the beginning draw after them many advantages. They pr event a good deal of pain and inflammation, lessen any feveriſh aſſaults, forward the digeſtion, and ſeldom fail to obviate impoſthumations, and a long train of complicated ſymptoms which are wont otherwise to interrupt the cure, miſerably haraſs the poor patient, and too often endanger his life ; and even where the feveriſh ſymptoms run high, and there is almoſt a certainty that matter is forming, bleeding, in that ſtate, is very frequently of great advantage.</p><p>For the firſt 12 days it will be proper to obſerve a cooling regimen, both in reſpect of the medicines that may be preſcribed, and the diet requiſite for the ſupport of nature. It is abſolutely neceſſary likewiſe that the body be conſtantly kept open. Unleſs, therefore, nature does this office of herſelf, a ſtool ſhould be every day procured, either by emollient clyſters, or ſome gentle laxative taken at the mouth ; and whenever there is much pain in the wounded parts, immediate recourſe muſt be had to opium.</p><p>As to external applications, whatever is of a hot ſpirituous nature is remarkably injurious on theſe occaſions, and what no wounded part can in any degree bear. The wound may be dreſſed with pledgits of any emollient ointment ; the whole being covered with a common poultice, or, in ſome caſes, the preparations of lead may be uſed. An opiate ſhould now be adminiſtered ; and the part affected being placed in the eaſieſt and moſt convenient poſture, the patient ſhould be laid to reſt. The formation of matter, in every contuſed wound, is an object of the firſt importance ; for, till this takes place, there is often reaſon to ſuſpect that gangrene may happen. With a view to hasten ſuppuration, the warm poultices ſhould be frequently renewed, and they ſhould be continued till the tenſion and ſwelling, with which wounds of this kind are uſually attended, be removed, and till the ſore has acquired a red, healthy, granulating appearance, when it is to be treated like a common ulcer.</p><p>Gun ſhot wounds are commonly covered from the beginning with deep ſloughs, and various remedies are recommended for removing them. Every appearance, however, of this kind with which they are attended proceeds entirely from contuſion ; and, excepting the injury be extenſive, the ſlough is not often perceptible, or it is ſo thin as to come away along with the matter at the firſt or second dreſſing. Although emollient poultices be extremely uſeful, they ought to be no longer continued than till the effects already mentioned are produced; otherwiſe they will not only relax the parts, but alſo produce too copious a diſcharge of matter, which is ſometimes attended with great danger. A too copious flow of matter may proceed from different cauſes ; but in whatever way it may have been produced, the practice to be adopted muſt be nearly the ſame. Every collection which appears muſt have a free outlet, and the limb laid in that poſture which will moſt readily admit of its running off. In ſuch circumſtances, nouriſhing diet and Peruvian bark in conſiderable quantities are highly uſeful. When the diſcharge continues copious, in ſpite of every effort to check it, detached pieces of bone or ſome extraneous matter are probably the cauſe. In ſuch a ſituation nothing will lessen the quantity of matter till ſuch ſubſtances be removed. The wound ought therefore again to be examined, and looſe bodies removed. Pieces of cloth have been known to be removed by ſetons, when that method was practicable, after every other method had failed. Opium likewiſe is frequently uſeful in checking an exceſſive diſcharge, when it happens to be kept up by irritation.</p><p>Although no conſiderable hemorrhagy may happen at firſt in gun-ſhot wounds; yet after the ſloughs commonly produced upon ſuch occaſions have come off, ſome conſiderable arteries may be expoſed, and then a dangerous hemorrhagy may enſue. The hemorrhagy is often preceded by a great heat in the injured parts, and with a throbbing pulſatory pain. At this period it may frequently be pre<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0104.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0098"/>
vented by plentiful blood-letting, particularly local. But if the hemorrhagy has fairly taken place, and from arteries of conſiderable ſize, nothing will do but the proper application of ligatures. As the diſcharge in theſe caſes would often prove dangerous before the ſurgeon could be procured, the attendants ſhould be furniſhed with a tourniquet, with directions to apply it, upon the firſt appearance of blood.</p><p>Till of late years the ſcarifying of gun-ſhot wounds was a practice which prevailed very univerſally among ſurgeons; and it was expected by this, that the ſloughs with which wounds are ſometimes covered would ſooner ſeparate, and that the cure would thereby be more readily performed. It is now, however, known, that this practice, inſtead of being uſeful, very generally does harm by increaſing the inflammation. It ſhould therefore be laid entirely aſide. When a gun-ſhot wound cannot eaſily or ſafely be laid open from one end to the other, perhaps it may be proper to introduce a cord through the ſinus. This, however, ſhould not be attempted till the ſirſt or inflammatory ſtate of the wound is over : but when a cord cannot be properly introduced, on account of the ſituation or direction of the wound, compreſſion may prove equally uſeful here as in caſes of punctured wounds.</p><p>Mortification happening after gun-ſhot wounds, is to be treated in the ſame manner as if it had ariſen from any other cauſe, only bark is not to be promiſcuouſly uſed; as, in plethoric habits, it may prove hurtful; though in debilitated relaxed habits it will be extremely uſeful ; but even in ſuch it ſhould never be given while much pain and tenſion continue.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV. <hi rend="italic">Of Poiſoned Wounds.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Poison</hi> may be introduced into the ſyſtem various ways. The effects of the poiſon introduced by the stings of insects may frequently be prevented by applying immediately vinegar or ardent spirits. After inflammation has come on, the moſt effectual remedy is the waſhing the parts with cold water. The bite of a viper is not always dangerous ; but as we can never judge with certainty whether the wound be poiſoned or not, and as the poiſon of this animal acts very ſpeedily upon the ſyſtem, its bad effects ought to be prevented by every poſſible means. The injured part ought either to be cut out immediately, or deſtroyed with the actual or potential cautery.</p><p>Formerly ſuction was much employed, and frequently with ſucceſs : it ſhould not, however, prevent the removal of the part. After the part has been removed, we ſhould endeavour to produce a plentiful ſuppuration. When the poiſon appears to have entered the ſyſtem, the application of warm oil over the whole body has been extolled ; and it has been ſaid that advantage has been derived from the internal uſe of it. From ſome late obſervations, however, the efficacy of this remedy is much to be doubted. Perhaps a plentiful ſweat, kept up for a conſiderable time, is the moſt certain method yet diſcovered. Small doſes of volatile alkali frequently repeated is more to be depended on for producing this effect than any other remedy.</p><p>The bite of a mad animal occaſions the moſt formidable poiſoned wound known in this country. In theſe wounds hydrophobia indeed does not always enſue ; but when it does, death is almoſt certainly the conſequence. A variety of noſtrums for preventing and curing this diſeaſe have been held forth to the public ; but there is ſcarcely any well atteſted fact of any one of them proving uſeful. Nothing yet known can be depended upon but the immediate removal of the injured part, either with the ſcalpel or the actual or potential cautery ; which, together with a plentiful ſuppuration, has, in different inſtances, appeared to anſwer the purpoſe effectually ; at leaſt, patients treated in this manner have escaped, while others bit at the ſame time by the ſame animal have ſuffered. The ſooner the operation is performed, the more effectual it is likely to prove ; but it ought not to he omitted, even though ſome time has elapſed from the time that the wound was inflicted; for there is reaſon to ſuppoſe that this poiſon does not enter the ſyſtem ſo quickly as ſeveral others are obſerved to do. Sea-bathing has been much recommended in all ages as a preventive ; but there are few well atteſted caſes of its being attended with advantage. Many practitioners depend much on mercury ; and as it can be uſed along with any other plan of treatment, it ought not to be neglected,</p><p>When wounds are poiſoned by the application of matter from certain fores, as thoſe of the venereal or cancerous kinds, or ſrom any oſ the vegetable poiſons, it is better to remove the part affected immediately, than to undergo a courſe of medicines generally flow and often doubtful in their operations.</p><p>The metallic poiſons do not fall to be conſidered in this place ; for however deleterious they may be when taken into the ſtomach, they ſeldom appear to be otherwiſe hurtful, when applied to wounds, than by irritating or corroding the parts with which they come in contact.</p><p>CHAP.

The second by ſuperficial ſwelling, burning pain, dulled colour, apt to ſpread, diſappearing when pressed, and quickly returning ; the part affected is frequently covered with ſmall veſicles. The conſequences of inflammation are ſuppuration and gangrene, unleſs the inflammation be checked and terminated by reſolution.— That an inflammation will terminate in ſuppuration may be known from the length of time it has continued, from the remiſſion of the pain and hardneſs, the greater elevation of the ſkin in the middle part, a change of colour ſrom red to bluiſh or livid, a slight fever with ſhivering, and from a fluctuation of matter perceived on handling the part.</p><p>During the firſt ſtage of the inflammation; however, we ought, for the moſt part, to endeavour to reſolve it, or prevent the ſuppuration. Yet ſome caſes muſt be excepted. For inſtance, thoſe inflammatory ſwellings which ſometimes occur in fevers, or ſucceed to them, ought always to be brought to ſuppuration ; and it might be very dangerous to attempt a reſolution of them. In ſwellings of a scrophulous nature, it is perhaps beſt to do nothing at all, either with a. view to reſolve or ſuppurate. Thus it might be dangerous to make uſe of repellent applications, at the ſame time that it is by no means adviſable to promote their ſuppuration; the cure of ſuch ſwellings, when opened, proving always very troubleſome ; while at the ſame time it is known, that ſuch ſwellings may remain for a very long time without any riſk to the patient. In the lues venerea, too, as we are posseſſed of a certain antidote for the diſorder, it is beſt not to attempt the ſuppuration of any buboes which may ap-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0105.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0099"/>
year ; as the cure of them, when opened, very often proves extremely troubleſome ; and as their being opened cannot contribute any thing towards their cure.</p><p>Where the inflammation is but beginning, and the ſymptoms are not ſo violent as to affect the general ſyſtem, topical remedies, with a due attention to regimen, often answer in reſolving them. The firſt thing to be attended to in the caſe of every inflammation, is the removal of the exciting cauſes, which either have brought on the inflammation originally, or which may continue it after it is begun. Such are extraneous bodies in wounds, pieces of fractured bones, luxations, &amp;c. Of all the various applications for an inflamed part, thoſe of a ſedative nature are chiefly to be depended upon ; and, next to theſe, emollients. Of the former kind we may conſider all the different preparations of lead dissolved in vinegar; together with vinegar itſelf, which generally acts alſo as a ſedative. Among the latter we may place the mild expreſſed oils, as alſo the ſoft ointments made with theſe oils and pure wax.</p><p>When we speak of ſedative medicines, however, it muſt not be underſtood that all of that claſs are to be uſed indiſcriminately. Thus opium, though one of the moſt powerful of all ſedatives, yet as its application, externally, to the human body, is always attended with ſome degree of irritation, however uſeful it may at times be found in ſome particular ſpecies of inflammatory diſorders, will never, probably, as an external application, become of general uſe in theſe caſes. Warm emollient fomentations alſo, though powerful ſedatives, as tending more effectually to remove tenſion and pain than perhaps any other remedy, are conſtantly found to be improper where a reſolution is to be wiſhed for. Their constant effect is, either to bring the ſwelling to a ſuppuration, or to relax the parts in ſuch a manner as to render the removal of the diſorder always exceedingly tedious.</p><p>Mr Bell recommends the preparations of lead as proper applications, in caſes of external inflammation, where we wiſh for a reſolution. The beſt method of applying it, he ſays, is in the form of a watery ſolution ; and he gives the following formula: “ R. Sacchar. ſaturn. 3fs. ; ſolve in acet. pur. 3iv. ; et adde aq. ſontan. diſtillat. lbij. The addition of vinegar renders the ſolution much more complete than it otherwiſe would be ; and without it indeed a very conſiderable proportion of the lead generally ſeparates and falls to the bottom.</p><p>In making uſe of this ſolution in caſes of inflammation, as it is of conſequence to have the parts affected kept constantly moiſt with it, cataplaſms prepared with it and crumb of bread in general anſwer that intention exceedingly well. But when the inflamed part is ſo tender and painful as not eaſily to bear the weight of a poultice, which is frequently the caſe, pieces of ſoft linen moiſtened with the ſolution answer the purpoſe tolerably well. Both ſhould be applied cold, or at leaſt with no greater warmth than is merely neceſſary for preventing pain or uneaſineſs to the patient : they ſhould be kept almoſt conſtantly at the part, and renewed always before turning ſtiff or hard.</p><p>When the tenſion and irritation on the skin are conſiderable, emollients are often attended with very great advantage : the parts affected being, in ſuch a ſtate of the diſorder, gently rubbed over with any of the mild expreſſed oils two or three times a-day, the tenſion, irritation, and pain are often very much relieved, and the diſcuſſion of the tu, mor thereby greatly promoted.</p><p>In every caſe of inflammation, indeed, emollient applications would afford ſome relief. But as the preparations of lead, already recommended, prove in all ſuch diſorders ſtill more advantageous ; and as unguents of every kind tend conſiderably to blunt the action of lead ; theſe two ſets of remedies ſhould as ſeldom as poſſible be allowed to interfere with one another ; and emollients ſhould accordingly never be preſcribed, but when the circumſtances already mentioned, of irritation, tenſion, and pain, are ſo conſiderable as to render their application altogether neceſſary.</p><p>When the part affected with inflammation is not very tender, or lies deep, applications of vinegar are often had recourſe to with conſiderable advantage : the moſt effectual form of uſing it ſeems to be by way of cataplaſm, made with the ſtrongeſt vinegar and crumb of bread. In such caſes, an alternate uſe of this remedy, with the ſaturnine ſolution, has produced more beneficial effects than are commonly obſerved from a continued courſe of any one of them.</p><p>At the ſame time that theſe applications are continued, blooding with leeches, or cupping and ſcarifying, as near as poſſible to the part affected, is generally of very great ſervice ; and in no caſe of local inflammation ſhould ever be omitted. In all ſuch caſes, the whole body, but more eſpecially the diſeaſed part, ſhould be preſerved as free as poſſible from every kind of motion ; and, for the ſame reaſon, the neceſſity of a low cooling diet, in every inflammatory diſorder, appears obvious, as does alſo a total abſtinence from spirituous and fermented liquors.</p><p>In slight caſes of inflammation, a due perſeverance of the ſeveral articles taken notice of will, in general, be found ſufficient for every purpoſe. But when there is likewiſe a full, hard, or quick pulſe, with other ſymptoms of fever, general blood-letting becomes neceſſary; the quantity of blood taken away being always to be determined by the violence oſ the diſorder, and by the age and ſtrength of the patient. Evacuation, however, ſhould never be carried to a greater height than what is merely neceſſary for moderating the febrile ſymptoms ; for if ſuppuration ſhould take place after the ſyſtem is too much reduced, its progreſs is thereby rendered much more slow and uncertain, nor will the patient be ſo able to bear the diſcharge that muſt enſue upon opening the abſceſs. The uſe of gentle laxatives, together with cooling diaphoretic medicines, are alſo attended with very good effects.</p><p>Theſe different evacuations being premiſed, the next object of conſequence is to procure eaſe and quietneſs to the patient ; which is often, in inflammatory cases, of more real ſervice than any other circumſtance whatever. The moſt effectual remedy for this purpoſe is opium ; which, when pain and irritation are conſiderable, as in extenſive inflammations very frequently happens, ſhould never be omitted. In large wounds, eſpecially after amputations and other capital operations, alſo in punctures of all kinds, large doſes of opium are always attended with remarkable good effects. In all ſuch caſes, however, opium, in order to have a proper influence, ſhould, as was obſerved, be adminiſtered in very large doſes ; otherwiſe, inſtead of proving ſerviceable, it ſeems rather to have the contrary effect ; a circumſtance which is perhaps the chief reaſon for opiates in general having been very unjuſtly condemned in every caſe of inflammation.</p><p>By a proper attention to the different circumſtances taken notice of, in the courſe of three or four days, and ſometimes in a ſhorter ſpace of time, reſolution of the tumor will in general begin to take place ; at leaſt before the end of that period it may, for the moſt part, be known how the diſorder is to terminate. If the heat, pain, and other attending ſymptoms abate, and eſpecially if the tumor begins to decreaſe, without the occcurrence of any gangrenous appearances, we may then be almoſt certain that by a continuance of the ſame plan a total reſolution will in time be effected.</p><p>But, on the contrary, if all the different ſymptoms rather<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0106.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0100"/>
increaſe ; and eſpecially if the tumor turns larger, and ſomewhat ſoft, with an increaſe of throbbing pain ; we may then with tolerable certainty conclude, that ſuppuration will take place ; and ſhould therefore immediately deſiſt from ſuch applications as were judged proper while a cure was thought practicable by reſolution, and endeavour to aſſiſt nature as much as poſſible in the formation of pus, or what is called <hi rend="italic">maturation</hi> of the tumor. For this purpoſe there is nothing better than to preſerve a proper degree of heat in the parts. This is commonly done by the means of warm fomentations and cataplaſms ; and when theſe are regularly and frequently renewed, nothing, it is probable, could more effectually anſwer the purpoſe. But in the ordinary manner in which they are applicd, by the cataplaſms being renewed only once, or at moſt twice a day, they muſt always, it is imagined, do more harm than good. For ſo ſoon as the degree of heat they were at firſt poſseſſed of is diſſipated, the moiſture kept up by them, with the conſequent evaporation which enſues, muſt always render the part a great deal colder than if it had been merely wrapped in flannel without the uſe of any ſuch application.</p><p>In order to receive all the advantages of ſuch remedies, the part affected ſhould be well fomented with flannels presſed out of any warm emollient decoction, applied as warm as the patient can eaſily bear them, continued at leaſt half an hour at once, and repeated four times a day.</p><p>Immediately aſter the fomentation is over, a large emollient poultice ſhould likewiſe be applied warm, and renewed every ſecond or third hour at fartheſt. Of all the forms recommended for emollient cataplaſms, a common milk and bread poultice, with a proportion of butter or oil, is perhaps the moſt eligible ; as it not only possesses all the advantages of the others, but can at all times be more eaſily obtained.</p><p>Roaſted onions, garlic, and other acrid ſubſtances, are frequently made uſe of as additions to maturating cataplaſms. When there is not a due degree of inflammation in the rumor, and when it appears probable that the ſuppuration would be quickened by having the inflammatory ſymptoms somewhat increased, the addition of ſuch ſubſtances may then be of ſervice ; but when ſtimulants are neceſſary in ſuch caſes, a ſmall proportion of ſtrained galbanum, or of any of the warm gums, diſſolved in the yolk of an egg, and added to the poultices, is a more certain form of applying them. Whenever the inflammation, however, takes place to a proper degree, ſuch ſtimulating ſubſtances never can be neceſſary ; and in many caſes, it is apprehended, they may even do miſchief.</p><p>In ſuch tumors as, from their being posseſſed of little or no inflammation, are commonly ſaid to be of a cold nature, as they are generally indolent, and proceed very ſlowly to ſuppuration, plaſters compoſed of the warm gums are often had recourſe to with conſiderable advantage. In ſuch caſes, they are not only of uſe by the ſtimulus and irritation they occaſion, but by the heat which they tend to preſerve in the part. They become particularly neceſſary when the patient, by being obliged to go abroad, cannot have cataplaſms frequently enough renewed, or ſo conveniently applied ; but when ſome ſuch objection does not occur, the latter, for very obvious reaſons, ſhould always be preferred.</p><p>Dry cupping, as it is termed, that is, cupping without the uſe of the ſcarificator, upon or as near as poſſible to the part affected, is frequently had recourſe to with advantage in promoting the ſuppuration of tumors. It is only, however, in ſuch as theſe laſt mentioned, where there ſeems to be a deficiency of inflammation, that it can ever either be neceſſary or uſeful ; but in all tumors of a real indolent nature, and where there is ſtill ſome probability of a ſuppuration, no remedy is more effectual.</p><p>Theſe different applications, under the reſtrictions taken notice of, being continued for a longer or ſhorter time, according to the ſize of the tumor, its ſituation, and other circumſtances, a thorough ſuppuration may in general at laſt be expected.</p><p>Matter being fully formed in a tumor, is known by a remiſſion of all the ſymptoms taking place ; the throbbing pain, which before was frequent, now goes off, and the patient complains of a more dull, confiant, heavy pain ; the tumor points at ſome particular part, generally near to its middle; where, if the matter is not encyſted, or deep ſeated, a whitiſh yellow appearance is obſerved, inſtead of a deep red that formerly took place ; and fluctuation of a fluid underneath is, upon preſſure, very evidently diſcovered. Sometimes, indeed, when an abſceſs is thickly covered with muſcular and other parts, though, from concurring circumſtances, there can be little doubt of there being even a very conſiderable collection of matter, yet the fluctuation cannot be readily diſtinguiſhed : it does not, however, often happen, that matter is ſo very deeply lodged as not to be diſcovered upon proper examination.</p><p>This, however, is a circumſtance of the greateſt conſequence in practice, and deferves more attention than is commonly given to it. In no part of the ſurgeon’s employment is experience in former ſimilar caſes of greater uſe to him than in the preſent ; and however simple it may appear, yet nothing, it is certain, more readily diſtinguishes a man of obſervation and extenſive practice, than his being able eaſily to detect collections of deep-ſeated matter ; whilſt nothing, on the contrary, ſo materially affects the character of a ſurgeon, as his having, in ſuch caſes, given an inaccurate or unjuſt prognolis ; as the event, in diſorders of that nature, comes generally at laſt to be clearly demonstrated to all concerned.</p><p>Together with the ſeveral local ſymptoms of the preſence of pus already enumerated, may be mentioned the frequent ſhiverings to which patients are liable on its firſt formation; theſe, however, ſeldom occur ſo as to be diſtinctly obſerved, unleſs the collection is conſiderable, or ſeated internally in some of the viſcera.</p><p>After the matter is fully formed, and the abſceſs brought to maturity, the only remedy is to open it, and give vent to the pus it contains. In many caſes, indeed, nature will do the work, and abſcesses, when ſuperficially ſeated, will certainly burſt of themſelves : but where the matter lies deep, we are by no means to wait ſor this ſpontaneous opening; as the pus will acquire an acrimony before it can break throu the integuments, which may prove very prejudicial to health. However, it is a general rule not to open abſcesses. till a thorough ſuppuration has taken place ; for, when laid open long before that period, and while any conſiderable hardneſs remains, they commonly prove more troubleſome, and ſeldom heal ſo kindly.</p><p>In ſome caſes, however, it is neceſſary to deviate from this general rule, and to open them a good deal ſooner ; particularly in all ſuch critical abſcesses as occur in malignant fevers. In like manner, in the plague, we are commonly advised to open ſuch tumors, ſo ſoon as they are at all tolerably advanced, and not to wait till they are fully maturated ; as, from experience in theſe diſorders, it is found to be of more conſequence, for the removal of the original diſeaſe, to have a quick diſcharge of matter produced, than any harm the patient can ever ſuffer from having a ſwelling ſomewhat prematurely laid open.</p><p>In abſcesses, alſo, ſituated on any of the joints, or upon<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0107.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0101"/>
either of the large cavities oſ the breaſt and abdomen, and more eſpecially when they ſeem to run deep, they ſhould always be opened as ſoon as the leaſt fluctuation of matter is diſcovered. For, when the resiſtance is on every side equal, they juſt as readily point inwardly as outwardly : and the conſequence oſ a large abſceſs burſting into either of the large cavities, is well known moſt frequently to prove fatal: An inſtance of which, in ths following caſe, with very little attention, might have been prevented. A ſurgeon oſ eminence, and of very extenſive practice, was applied to by a young healthy-looking man, with a large abſceſs upon the left side of his cheſt. A fluctuation of a fluid was, upon preſſure, very evidently diſcovered; and it was agreed, by other two practitioners who were preſent, that an opening ſhould be made to give vent to the matter. But the operator, being much engaged in buſineſs, could not fix on an earlier period for doing it than the third day from the patient’s applying to him : unluckily, however, the patient died ſuddenly in his bed the night before the abſceſs was to have been opened. On examining the body, the tumor had disappeared entirely, without any external opening being obſervable ; and, on opening the thorax, it was found to have burſt inwardly upon the lungs, and produced immediate ſuffocation.</p><p>In every other circumſtance, however, except in the caſes alluded to, the rule in opening abſcesses is, as was already remarked, To allow a thorough ſuppuration to take place, before any vent whatever be given to the matter ; and it being then determined to lay the collection open, the next queſtion that occurs, is with reſpect to the manner of doing it.</p><p>There are three ways of opening an abſceſs ſo as to give an outlet to the matter ; by cauſtic, by inciſion, or by the introduction of a ſeton. The firſt is more agreeable to timid patients, who are afraid of the pain of inciſion, but is attended with some inconveniences which render the method of inciſion much preferable. Cauſtic acts slowly, and produces a long continued pain ; beſides, no kind of cauſtic has yet been invented, the effects of which can be confined to a certain determinate extent ; hence the patient is liable to ſuffer much unneceſſary pain, as the cauſtics commonly employed are either the lapis infernalis or lunar cauſtic. The abſeeſs is to have a slip of adheſive plaſter applied to it, with a ſlit cut in it of a ſize somewhat leſs than the opening is intended to be. This ſlit is to be filled with cauſtic reduced into a powder, and wetted to make it act more quickly. It is then to be covered over with a plaſter, and the whole is ſecured with a firm compreſs and bandage. The time neceſſary for the cauſtic to make a ſufficient opening will depend upon the thickneſs oſ the ſkin and ſtrength of the cauſtic ; but generally it requires ſeveral hours. When we find that an eschar is made, it is to be softened with any emollient ointment until it can be readily ſeparated ; after which, the matter is to be diſcharged, and the abiceſs treated as one opened by inciſion.</p><p>The method of opening abſcesses by the knife is, to make an inciſion of ſuch a ſize as to give free vent to the matter. The opening is to be made in the under part of the tumor, that the matter may pais readily out. It has been a practice among Turgeons either to open a large absceſs from end to end, or at leaſt through two-thirds of its length ; but from the bad conſequences which often attend this method, the lateſt practitioners have thought it better merely to give a free diſcharge to the matter, without expoſing the part to the action of the air.</p><p>The third method, viz. that by the ſeton, is now frequently employed. It has the advantage of being attended with little pain, emptying the abſceſs,in a gradual manner, and completely preventing the access of the air, which, in the other two methods, is often attended with bad conſequences ; and it frequently performs a cure in a much ſhorter time.</p><p>There are various inſtruments ſor introducing the ſeton: it may even frequently be done by a lancet and common probe ; but the inſtruments repreſented in Plate CCCCLXXXVII. fig. 1. and 2. are more frequently employed. One of theſe being threaded with glover’s ſoft ſilk, is to be introduced through the upper part of the tumor ; but if the blunt one (fig. 2.) be employed, it will be neceſſary to have the aſſiſtance of a lancet ; the inſtrument is then to be brought out at the under part of the tumor, and in this way the matter will be allowed to run gradually off.</p><p>The uſual mode of dreſſing an abſeeſs the firſt time is with dry lint. In the courſe of dreſſing, it will be proper to have regard to the ſituation of the abscess, and as much as poſſible to make the patient favour the diſcharge by his ordinary poſture ; and to this end alſo, the diſcharge muſt be aſſiſted by compreſs and bandage : the compreſs may be made of soft old linen, applied according to the nature of the part and the ſeaſon of the year. The frequency of dreſſing will depend on the quantity of diſcharge : once in 24 horns is ordinarily ſufficient; but ſometimes twice, or perhaps three times, is neceſſary.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Of Gangrene.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> other conſequence of inflammation is gangrene, which may terminate in mortification. When the colour of an in Hamed part changes to a dark red, when bliſters ariſe on it containing an ichorous fluid, we know that it has become gangrenous. When it becomes black, flaccid, and inſenſible, when it loses heat, and acquires a putrid: ſmell, it has proceeded to complete mortification. A gangrene ſeldom affects thoſe who enjoy a good habit of body, though, even in them, it may be brought on accidentally by whatever deſtroys the texture of <hi rend="italic">a part ;</hi> as contuſion, long continued preſſure, or whatever deprives <hi rend="italic">a part</hi> of its nouriſhment. In like manner, cold, by putting a ſtop to the circulation, may produce gangrene, and frequently does ſo in cold climates. This comes on ſuddenly, without any pain or previous inflammation ; and the patient himſelf is frequently inſenſible of it, till he is informed of his ſituation by ſome other perſon.</p><p>A defect in the circulation, in extreme old age, frequently occaſions mortification in the extremities.</p><p>There are ſome inſtances of what is called <hi rend="italic">dry gangrene,</hi> in which the parts continue totally mortified for a great length of time, without either turning very flaccid, or running into diſſolution. But ſuch cases never occur from inflammation ; they happen commonly from the flow of blood to ſuch parts being put a ſtop to by compreſſion of one kind or another, as tumors, ligatures, or other ſimilar cauſes, obſtructing the principal arteries which uſed to ſupply them ; which, when the ſtoppage of the circulation is complete, always occaſions a very slow, tedious, mortification ; and as the parts in ſuch inſtances are no longer ſupplied with freſh quantities of fluids, while a conſiderable evaporation muſt ſtill be going on, ſuch a degree of humidity cannot therefore poſſibly occur as does in other caſes of gangrene. So that ſpecies of the diſorder has, perhaps, with propriety enough, been termed the <hi rend="italic">dry gangrene.</hi></p><p>There is another variety of the diſeaſe termed <hi rend="italic">white gangrene ;</hi> in which the parts ſuppoſed mortified do not turn black, but retain nearly their former colour, &amp;c. Whether ſuch a complaint, however, can with propriety be denominated <hi rend="italic">gangrene</hi> or not, may properly be doubted : but as it is chiefly that ſpecies of the diſorder which ſucceeds inflam<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0108.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0102"/>
matron that is here particularly treated of, and in which no ſuch varieties are ever obſerved, it is not neceſſary to carry the inquiry farther.</p><p>The prognoſis in every caſe of gangrene is doubtful at firſt, as, even in the ſlighteſt caſes, the patient may suffer from the ſpreading of the diſeaſe; but slight caſes, from external injuries, are more favourable than thoſe which ariſe from internal cauſes, though no perſon can be considered ſafe till the diſeaſed parts are ſeparated, and even entirely caſt off. When inflammation happens round a mortified part, more eſpecially if pus be formed, we may pretty certainly pronounce that the mortified part will be thrown off.</p><p>When there is reaſon to ſuſpect from the violence of the fever and great heat of the inflamed part, that it will terminate in gangrene, blood-letting, and whatever may have a tendency to moderate the inflammation, may check its progreſs. But as the patient, in ſuch caſes, is ſometimes apt to sink afterwards, nothing more ought to be done than is merely neceſſary to moderate the preſent ſymptoms. If an inflamed ſurface put on a gangrenous appearance when the patient is weak, and the pulſe low, we muſt have recourſe to whatever may invigorate the ſyſtem, viz. a nouriſhing diet, with the free uſe of wine. Peruvian bark likewiſe is to be given in as great quantities as the ſtomach of the patient will permit. When the ſtomach cannot bear enough in ſubſtance, which is the beſt form of exhibiting it, it may be given either in form of tincture or joined with aromatics. External applications, ſuch as are of a ſtimulating nature, may likewiſe be uſeſul.</p><p>In the caſe of gangrene ariſing from cold, the part muſt he immerſed in very cold water, or rubbed with ſnow ; for if any thing warm be applied, or the patient brought near a fire, it certainly mortifies. If the whole body has become torpid with cold, the ſame practice muſt be followed ; the very cold water ſhould be afterwards changed for ſome that is a little warmer, and the patient gradually brought to a proper degree of heat. Rubbing with ſalt is ſometimes found uſeful. If the whole body be benumbed, cordials are not to be adminiſtered too suddenly. A glaſs of cold wine ſhould firſt be given, afterwards warm wine by itself, or with ſpices. If ſtronger cordials be required, ardent ſpirits may be employed. Notwithſtanding the greateſt attention, however, a mortification ſometimes takes place, and in ſome inſtances very suddenly ; as in the cafe of carbuncle, where, after an inflammation has continued for ſcarcely 24 hours, the parts become black, and end in real mortification.</p><p>In the treatment of mortified parts, a variety of external applications have been pointed out, and particularly thoſe of the antiſeptic kind ; ſuch as all the warm gums and balſams, ardent ſpirits, and even alcohol : and to admit of their nearer application to the found parts, with a view to the preservation of theſe from putrefaction, deep scarifications through the diſeaſed, and into the found parts, have been generally recommended. But although ſuch articles may be of uſe in preſerving dead animal-ſubſtances from corruption ; yet that they will always prove ſerviceable in the ſame manner in living bodies, is probably very much to be doubted. And it is even apprehended, by the ſtrong irritation they always occaſion when applied to a living fibre, that, in ſuch caſes as the preſent, they may rather do miſchief ; it being only a very slight degree of inflammation that is required to bring on a ſuppuration. The inciſions, when carried into the sound parts, with a view to facilitate the operation of ſuch remedies, may likewiſe do harm ; not only from the risk of wounding the blood-vessels, nerves, and tendons, that lie in the way, but alſo by allowing a free and farther entrance of the putreſcent fluids into the parts not yet affected - and unleſs they are carried so deep as freely to reach the sound parts, applications of the antiſeptic kind can never have any effect in anſwering the purpoſe for which they were intended.</p><p>All the advantages commonly obſerved from the great variety of applications recommcnded for gangrene, are obtained with more eaſe, and generally with more certainty, from the uſe of any gentle ſtimulating embrocation ; which, by exciting a slight irritation upon the ſurface, and especially when aſſiſted by a free uſe of the bark, at laſt commonly produces ſuch a degree of inflammation as is wiſhed for. With this view, a weak ſolution of ſal ammoniac in vinegar and water has been known to anſwer exceedingly well : a dram of the ſalt to two ounces of vinegar and six of water, forms a mixture of a very proper ſtrength for every purpoſe of this kind; but the degree of ſtimulus can be eaſily either increaſed or diminiſhed, according to circumſtances, by uſing a larger or ſmaller proportion of the ſalt.</p><p>Although, for the reaſons formerly advanced, inciſions may not in general be proper; yet in ſuch caſes where the mortification runs very deep, it is ſometimes of ſervice to make ſcarifications into the diſeaſed parts, ſo as to remove part of them ; which, by taking off a conſiderable load perhaps of putrid fleſh, not only lessens the fetor, which in ſuch caſes is always conſiderable, but often renders it more eaſy for the sound parts to free themſelves from the remainder. When with this view, however, inciſions are had recourſe to, care ſhould always be taken that they be not carried the length of the found parts.</p><p>When by the uſe of external or internal remedies, a ſeparation of the mortified part has been effected, and a diſcharge of pus produced, the remaining fore is then to be conſidered merely as a ſimple purulent ulcer, and may be treated in the ſame manner.</p><p>CHAP. IV. <hi rend="italic">Of Ulcers, White Swellings, Cancers, and Burns.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">Of Ulcers.</hi></p><p>A <hi rend="smallcaps">solution</hi> of continuity in any of the softer parts of the body, diſcharging either pus, ſanies, or any other vitiated matter, is termed <hi rend="italic">ulcer ;</hi> and when the ſame circumſtances happen to the bones, the term <hi rend="italic">caries</hi> or <hi rend="italic">carious ulcer</hi> is adopted.</p><p>Ulcers are diſtinguiſhed by their particular diſorders, though it ſeldom happens that the affections are not complicated ; and when we lay down rules ſor the management of one ſpecies of ulcer, it is generally requiſite to apply them to almoſt all others. However, the characters of moſt eminence are, the callous ulcer, the ſinuous ulcer, and the ulcer with caries of the adjacent bone : beſides this there is the putrid, the corroſive, the varicoſe ulcers, &amp;c. ; but as they have acquired their names from ſome particular affection, we ſhall ſpeak of the treatment of them under the general head of ulcers.</p><p>It will be often in vain to purſue the beſt means of cure by topical application, unleſs we are aſſiſted by internal remedies ; for as many ulcers are the effects of a particular indiſpoſition of body, it will be difficult to bring them into order while the cauſe of them remains. Thoſe which are cancerous and ſcrophulous ſeem to gain the leaſt advantage from phyſic ; for if in their beginnings they have ſometimes been very much relieved, or cured, by salivation, or any other evacuation, they are alſo often irritated and made worſe by them.</p><p>When an ulcer becomes foul, and diſcharges a naſty thin ichor, the edges of it, in proceſs of time, tuck in, and, growing skinned and hard, give it the name of a <hi rend="italic">callous ul-</hi><pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0109.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0103"/>
<hi rend="italic">cer ;</hi> which, as long as the edges continue in that ſtate, muſt neceſſarily be prevented from healing. But we are not immediately to deſtroy the lips of it, in expectation of a ſudden cure ; for while the malignity of the ulcer remains which was the occaſion of the callosity, the new lips will be ſubject to a relapſe of the ſame kind, however often the external ſurface of them be deſtroyed : we are to endeavour to bring the body of the ulcer into a dispoſition to recover by other methods. It ſometimes happens to poor laborious people, who have not been able to afford themſelves reſt, that lying a-bed will in a ſhort time give a diversion to the humours of the part, and the callous edges, ſoftening, will without any great aſſiſtance ſhoot out a cicatrix, when the ulcer is grown clean and filled with good fleſh. The effect of a ſalivation is generally the ſame; and even an iſſue ſometimes diſpoſes a neighbouring ulcer to heal. But though calloſities be frequently ſoftened by theſe means, yet when the ſurface of the ulcer begins to yield thick matter and little granulations of red fleſh ſhoot up, it will be proper to quicken nature by deſtroying the edges of it, if they remain hard. The manner of doing this, is by touching them a few days with the lunar cauſtic, or <hi rend="italic">lapis inſernalis.</hi> Some chose to cut them off with a knife : but this is very painful, and not more efficacious. When the lips do not tuck down cloſe to the ulcer, but hang looſe over it, as in ſome venereal buboes, the eaſieſt method is to cut them off with the ſcissars.</p><p>To digeſt the ulcer, or to procure good matter from it when in a putrid ſtate, there are an infinity of ointments invented ; but the baſilico flavum, alone, or ſoftened down ſometimes with turpentines, and ſometimes mixed up with different proportions of red precipitate, ſeems to ſerve the purpoſe of bringing an ulcer to cicatrization as well as any of the others. When the ulcer is incarned, the cure maybe finiſhed as in other wounds ; or if it do not cicatriſe kindly, ſt may be waſhed with aq. calcis, or aq. phag. or dreſſed with a pledgit dipt in tinct. myrrhæ : and if excoriations are ſpread round the ulcer, they may be anointed with ſperm. cet. ointment, or any other ſoft ointment.</p><p>The red precipitate has of late years acquired the credit it deferves for the cure of ulcers ; but, by falling into general uſe, is very often unſkilfully applied : when mixed with the baſilicon, or, what is nearer, a cerate of wax and oil, it is moſt certainly a digeſtive, fince it hardly ever fails to make the ulcer yield a thick matter in 24 hours, which diſcharged a thin one before the application of it.</p><p>If the ulcer produces a ſpongy fleſh, ſprouting very high above the ſurface, it will be neceſſary to deſtroy it by ſome of the eſcharotics, or the knife. This fungus differs very much ſrom that belonging to healing wounds, being more eminent and lax, and generally in one male ; whereas the other is in little diſtinct protuberances. It approaches often towards a cancerous complexion, and when it riſes upon ſome glands ſometimes actually degenerates into a cancer. When theſe excreſcences have ariſen in venereal ulcers, eſeharotics ſhould be applied. Thoſe in uſe, are the vitriol, the lunar cauſtic, the lapis inſernalis, and more generally the red precipitate powder.</p><p>It is but ſeldom that theſe inveterate funguſes appear on an ulcer ; but it is very usual for thoſe of a milder kind to riſe, which may often be made to ſubſide by preſſure and the uſe of mild eſeharotics : however, if the aſpect of the sore be white and ſmooth, as happens in ulcers accompanied with a dropsy, and often in young women with obſtructions, it will anſwer no purpoſe to waste the excreſcences until the conſtitution is repaired when moſt probably they will sink without any aſſiſtance. In ulcers alſo, where the ſubjacent bone is carious, great quantities of looſe flabby fleſh will grow up above the level of the skin : but as the caries is the cauſe of the diſorder, it will be in vain to expect a cure of the excreſcence until the rotten part of the bone be removed ; and every attempt with eſeharotics will be only a repetition of pain to the patient, without any advantage.</p><p>When the pain and inflammation are exceſſive, bleeding and other evacuations will often be ſerviceable ; and above all things, reſt and a horizontal poſition ; which laſt circumſtance is of ſo great importance to the cure of ulcers of the legs, that unleſs the patient will conform to it ſtrictly, the ſkill of the ſurgeon will often avail nothing : for as the indiſpoſition of theſe sores is in ſome mcaſure owing to the gravitation of the humours downwards, it will be much more beneficial to lie along than sit upright, though the leg be laid on a chair ; since even in this poſture they will descend with more force than if the body was reclined.</p><p>In ulcers of the legs, accompanied with varices or dilatations of the veins, the method of treatment will depend upon the other circumſtances of the sore ; for the varix can only be aſſiſted by the application of bandage, which muſt be continued a conſiderable time after the cure. The neateſt bandage is the laced ſtocking, which is particularly ſerviceable in this caſe ; though alſo, if the legs be œdematous, or if, after the healing of the ulcers, they ſwell when the patient quits his bed, it may be worn with ſafety and advantage. There are inſtances of one vein only being varicous; which, when it happens, may be deſtroyed by tying it above and below the dilatation, as in an aneuriſm ; but this operation ſhould only be practiſed where the varix is large and painful.</p><p>Ulcers of many years ſtanding are very difficult of cure ; and in old people the cure is often dangerous, frequently exciting an aſthma, a diarrhoea, or a fever, which deſtroys the patient, unleſs the ſore break out again : ſo that it is not altogether adviſable to attempt the abſolute cure in ſuch caſes; but only the reduction of them into better order, and leſs compaſs, which, if they be not malignant, is generally done with reſt and proper care. The cure of thoſe in young people may be undertaken with more ſafety ; and in all caſes of ſtubborn ulcers, the bark, very copiously given, will be found of the utmoſt ſervice.</p><p>When an ulcer or abſceſs has any ſinuſes or channels opening and diſcharging themſelves into the ſore, they are called <hi rend="italic">ſinuous ulcers.</hi> Theſe ſinuſes, if they continue to drain a great while, grow hard in the ſurface of their cavity, and then are termed fistulae <hi rend="italic">,</hi> and the ulcer a sistulou <hi rend="italic">s ulcer ;</hi> alſo, if matter be diſcharged from any cavity, as thoſe of the joints, abdomen, &amp;c. the opening is called a si <hi rend="italic">nuοus ulcer</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">fistula.</hi></p><p>The treatment of theſe ulcers depends upon a variety of circumſtances. If the matter of the ſinus be thick, ſtrict bandage and compreſs will sometimes bring the oppoſite ſides of the ſinus to a reunion : if the ſinus grow turgid in any part, and the ſkin thinner, ſhowing a diſpoſition to break, the matter must be made to puſh more againſt that part, by plugging it up with a tent ; and then a counter opening muſt be made, which proves often ſufficient for the whole abſceſs, if it be not afterwards too much tented, which locks up the matter and prevents the healing ; or too little, which will have the ſame effect : for dreſſing quite superficially does ſometimes prove as miſchievous as tents, and ſor nearly the ſame reaſon ; since ſuffering the external wound to contract into a narrow orifice before the internal one be incarned, does almoſt as effectually lock up the matter as a tent. To preſerve, then, a medium in theſe caſes, a hollow tent of lead or silver may be kept in the orifice, which, at the same time that it keeps it open, gives vent to the matter. The abſcesses where the counter opening is<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0110.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0104"/>
made moſt frequently are thoſe of compound fractures, and the breaſt : but the latter do offener well without dilatation than the former ; though it muſt be performed in both, if practicable, the whole length of the abſeeſs, when after ſome trial the matter does not lessen in quantity, and the ſides of it grow thinner ; and if the ſinuſes be ſiſtulous, no cure need be expected without dilatation.</p><p>When an ulcer with looſe rotten fleſh diſcharges more than the ſize of it ſhould yield, and the diſcharge is oily and ſtinking, in all probability the bone is carious ; which may easily be diſtinguiſhed by running the probe through the fleſh : and if ſo, it is called a <hi rend="italic">carious ulcer.</hi> The cure oſ theſe ulcers depends principally upon the removal of the rotten part of the bone, without which it cannot heal. Thoſe caries which happen from the matter of abscesses lying too long upon the bone, are moſt likely to recover : thoſe of lues venerea very often do well, becauſe that diſtemper fixes ordinarily upon the middle and outſide of the denſeſt bones, which admit of exfoliation ; but thoſe produced by ſcrophula, where the whole extremities of the ſpongy parts of the bone are affected, are exceedingly dangerous. All enlarged bones are not neceffarily carious ; and there are ulcers ſometimes on the ſkin which covers them, which do not communicate with the bone, and conſequently do well without exfoliation ; nay, it ſometimes happens, though the caſe be rare, that, in young ſubjects particularly, the bones will be carious to ſuch a degree, as to admit a probe almoſt through the whole ſubſtance of them ; and yet afterwards admit of a cure, without any notable exfoliation.</p><p>The method of treating an ulcer with caries, is by applying a cauſtic of the ſize of the ſcale of the bone which is to be exfoliated ; and after having laid it bare, to wait till the carious part can without violence be ſeparated, and then heal the wound. In order to quicken the exfoliation, there have been ſeveral applications deviſed ; but that which has been moſt uſed in all ages, is the actual cautery, with which ſurgeons burn the naked bone every day, or every other day, to dry up, as they ſay, the moiſture, and by that means procure the ſeparation : but as this practice is never of great ſervice, and always cruel and painful, it is now pretty much exploded. Indeed, from conſidering the appearance of a wound, when a ſeale of bone is taken out of it, there is little doubt that burning retards rather than haftens the ſeparation ; ſor as every ſeale of a carious bone is flung off by new fleſh generated between it and the found bone, whatever would prevent the growth of theſe granulations would alſo in a degree prevent the exfoliation ; which muſt certainly be the effect of a red-hot iron applied ſo cloſe to it.</p><p>Some caries of the bones are ſo very ſhallow, that they crumble inſenſibly away, and the wound fills up ; but when the bone will neither exfoliate nor admit of granulations, it will be proper to ſcrape it with a rugine, or perforate it in many points with a convenient instrument down to the quick. In ſcrophulous caſes, the bones of the carpus and tarſus are often affected ; and from their ſpongineſs they are ſeldom cured : ſo that when theſe, or indeed the extremities of any of the bones, are carious through their ſubſtance, it is adviſable to amputate ; though there are inſtances in the ſcrophula, but more eſpecially in critical abscesses, where, after long dreſſing down, the ſplinters, and ſometimes the whole ſubſtance, of the ſmall bones, have worked away, and a healthy habit of body coming on, the ulcer has healed ; but theſe are ſo rare, that no great dependence is to be laid on ſuch an event. The dreſſings of carious bones, if they are ſtinking, may be doſſils dipped in the tincture of myrrh ; otherwiſe thoſe oſ dry lint are eaſieſt, and keep down the cdges of the ulcer better than any other gentle applications.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Of White Swellings.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">There</hi> are two ſpecies of white ſwellings, Mr Benjamin Bell obſerves; the one of a mild nature, and frequently admitting of a cure ; which the other never does. The former, named by our author the <hi rend="italic">rheumatic</hi> ſpecies of white swelling, begins with an acute pain, ſeemingly diffuſed over the whole joint, and frequently extending along the tendinous aponeu- roſes of the muscles which communicate with it. There is, from the beginning, an uniform ſwelling of the whole ſurrounding integuments. Great tenſion generally prevails; but at firſt there is ſeldom any external change of colour. From the commencement of the diſeaſe the motion of the joint is attended with exquiſite pain, and the patient keeps it conſtantly in a relaxed poſture, finding that the eaſieſt. Hence the tendons become extremely ſtiff and rigid, till at laſt the joints have the appearance of complete and real anchyloſes. The ſwelling now begins to augment, till the joint has acquired three or four times its natural ſize ; the cuticular veins become turgid and varicoſe ; at the ſame time that the muſcular ſubſtance of the limb below decays, though it frequently acquires an equality in ſize by becoming cedematous ; the pain becomes intolerable, eſpecially when the perſon is warm in bed or otherwiſe heated ; abſcesses form in different parts, which, either breaking of themſelves, or by being laid open, diſcharge conſiderable quantities of matter, but without any remarkable effect in reducing the ſize of the ſwelling. The pus diſeharged from theſe is at firſt of a tolerably good consiſtence, but ſoon degenerates into a thin ill-conditioned ſanies. However, the orifices ſrom whence it flows ſoon heal up, unleſs they are kept open by art ; and new collections breaking out, they burſt and heal up as before ; ſo that in long-continued dilorders of this kind, the ſurrounding integuments are often entirely covered with cicatrices.</p><p>In the mean time, the health of the patient gradually declines, from the violence of the pain, and the abſorption of matter into the ſyſtem, which takes place in ſome degree ſrom its ſirſt formation in the different abſeeffes ; but which never appears ſo evidently till the different abſeeffes have been laid open ; after which a quick pulſe, night-ſweats, and a weakening diarrhoea, are ſure to occur, which generally carry off the patient, if the member is not either amputated, or the diſeaſe cured ſome other way.</p><p>On diſſecting limbs which have been amputated for white ſwellings, the original diſeaſe appears to have been a morbid thickening of the ſurrounding ligaments, without any other affection of the joint whatever ; the bones and cartilages always remaining perfectly found, as likewiſe the synovia both in quantity and conliſtence. In the more advanced stages of the diſorder, the thickneſs of the ligaments is more conſiderable, and is generally attended with an effusion, into the ſurrounding cellular ſubſtance, of a thick glairy matter, which gives to ſwellings of this kind an elaſtic ſpringy feel, independent of the collections of matter the fluctuation of which may also be perceived. Through this glairy matter the collections of pus run in various directions, without ſeeming, however, to mix with it. In ſome inſtances alio a great many ſmall hydatides are obſerved ; all which form a confuſed maſs, incapable of further diffec- tion.</p><p>All the above-mentioned appearances have been obſerved without any affection of the bones or cartilages. But when, by a very long continuance of the diſorder the ligaments come to be corroded by the different collections of<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0111.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0105"/>
matter, the cartilages and in conſequence thereof the bones, ſoon begin to ſuffer. The tendons of the flexor muscles, though very ſtiff and contracted, do not, upon diſſection, ſhow any ſigns of diſeaſe.</p><p>The above is an hiſtory of the mildeſt ſpecies of white ſwelling ; the more inveterate kind our author names the <hi rend="italic">ſcrophulous white ſwelling.</hi> In this the pain is commonly very violent ; more acute than in the former ; and, inſtead of being diffuſed, is confined to a particular ſpot, commonly the very middle of the joint. The ſwelling is commonly inconſiderable at firſt ; inſomuch that, on ſome occaſions, even when the pain has been very violent, little difference in point of ſize could be obſerved between the diſeaſed and the sound joint. The motion of the joint is attended with very great pain, and the tendons become ſtiff. As the diſorder advances, the pain becomes more violent, and the ſwelling incrcaſes, with an evident enlargement of the ends of the bones. The ſame elaſtic feel, together with ſimilar abſcesses, occur in this as in the laſt : but upon opening them they commonly diſcharge a thin fetid stuff ; the bones are found to be carious, and pieces of them are frequently diſcharged at the openings.</p><p>By the continuance of the diſorder, the conſtitution ſuffers, as in the first ſpecies of the diſeaſe ; and a diarrhoea with night-ſweats commencing, the patient is ſoon reduced to little more than ſkin and bone.</p><p>Upon ſuch joints being dissected in the firſt ſtages of the diſorder, the ſoft parts ſeem very little affected : but there is conſtantly obſerved an enlargement either of the whole ends of the bones, or of their epiphyſes ; frequently of thoſe on one side of the joint only ; in others, again, the bones on both ſides have been affected.</p><p>This enlargement ſometimes occurs without any other evident diſeaſe : but in general, and always in a more advanced ſtate of the complaint, the ſoft ſpongy parts of ſuch bones appear diſſolved into a thin, fluid, fetid matter ; and that too, in ſome caſes, without the cartilages which ſurround them ſeeming much affected. In process of time the cartilages are likewiſe diſſolved ; and then the matter of the bones and ſofter parts mixing together, ſuch ſwellings exhibit in that ſtate a ſtill more confuſed collection than is generally obſerved even in the worſt ſtages of the other ſpecies of the diſorder.</p><p>In the farther progreſs of this diſeaſe the ſurrounding ſoft parts likewiſe ſuffer : The ligaments become thickened, and the contiguous cellular membrane is fluffed with the viſcid glairy matter obſerved in the other ſpecies of the diſorder.</p><p>We come now to the conſideration of the different cauſes which tend to produce this diſeaſe. That the ligaments of the joints only are firſt affected in this disorder is rendered evident by diſſection. The thick glairy effuſions into the cellular membrane are probably occaſioned by an exudation ſrom the veſſels of thoſe ligaments that have been originally inflamed, as ſuch parts never furniſh a proper fluid for the formation of purulent matter : In the courte of the diſeaſe, indeed, abſcesses containing real pus always appear ; but never till inflammation has been communicated to the ſurrounding parts. We may conclude, therefore, that the firſt ſpecies of white ſwelling is always occaſioned by an <hi rend="italic">inflammatory</hi> or <hi rend="italic">rheumatic affection</hi> of the ligaments of ſuch joints as it attacks, from whatever cauſe ſuch inflammation may originally have proceeded.</p><p>The other ſpecies of the diſorder ſeems to be orignally an affection oſ the bones ; the ſurrounding ſoft parts coming only to ſuffer in the progreſs of the diſeaſe from their connection with and vincinity to theſe. This laſt ſpecies of white ſwelling generally begins without the patient being in the leaſt able to account ſor it : and from the effects which it produces on the bones attacked, appears to be a ſpecies of <hi rend="italic">ſpina ventoſa ;</hi> a diſeaſe of the bones probably of the ſame nature as ſcrophula is of the ſoft parts. Indeed, the appearances of the two diſorders, after making allowance for their different ſituations, are exceedingly ſimilar : they both begin with conſiderable enlargements or ſwellings of the parts, which generally end in ulcerations ; they both likewiſe frequently occur in the ſame perſon at the ſame time. This ſpecies of white ſwelling is generally either attended with other evident ſymptoms of ſcrophula ; or the patient, in an early period of life, has been ſubject to that diſeaſe ; or, which is nearly the ſame, he is deſcended ſrom ſcrophulous parents, and probably has the ſeeds of that diſeaſe lurking in his conſtitution. From all theſe circumſtances, it may with probability be concluded, that this ſpecies of white ſwelling is of a ſcrophulous nature: and since the other ſpecies of the diſorder is to be conſidered as an inflammatory affection, a thorough diſtinction between them is of very great importance ; it will not be improper therefore to give a ſhort enumeration of the ſeveral diagnoſtic er moſt characteriſtſe ſymptoms oſ each.</p><p>The pain in the firſt ſpecies is always, from the beginning, diffuſed over the whole joint, and ſometimes extends a conſiderable way along the muſcles that are attached to it : in the other ſpecies it is always at firſt, and ſometimes even when the complaint has been of conſiderable standing, confined to a very ſmall circumscribed ſpace. In the former, the ſwelling is always confined to the ſoft parts, and is from the beginning exceedingly evident : but in the latter, it is generally for ſome time hardly perceptible ; and when it appears the bones are the parts chiefly affected, the ſurrounding teguments coming only to ſuffer on a farther progreſs of the diſeaſe. Theſe are the chief local differences of the two ſpecies of this diſorder ; but ſome aſſiſtance in the diſtinction may likewiſe be obtained from the general habit oſ the patient, and from the manner in which the complaint may ſeem to have been produced. Thus, when ſuch ſwellings occur in young, ſtrong, plethoric, people, eſpecially in ſuch as have formerly been subject to rheumatiſm,they moſt probably will always prove of the mildeſt or rheumatic ſpecies of the diſorder: But when they appear in patients of ſcrophulous diſpoſitions, we need be under very little doubt in concluding them to be of a ſcrophulous nature.</p><p>The great utility of properly diſtinguiſhing the two different ſpecies of white ſwellings appears in no circumſtance ſo evident as in the treatment. In the one, there being ſome chance, by proper remedies, of being ſerviceable to the patient ; whereas in the other, viz. the ſcrophulous, it is not probable that art will ever be able to afford much aſſiſtance.</p><p>In the rheumatic white ſwelling, as it is always at firſt evidently of an inflammatory nature, conſiderable advantages are commonly obtained by a due attention to a proper cooling courſe. The firſt remedy which, with this view, ſhould be put in practice, is blood-letting immediately ſrom the part affected. Cupping and ſcarifying is here a principal remedy. The inſtrument ſhould be applied to each side of the diſeaſed joint ; on each side of the rotuula, for inſtance, when the knee is the part affected, and at leaſt eight or ten ounces of blood diſcharged ; and this to be repeated at proper intervals, once, twice, or oftener, according to the violence of the ſymptoms and ſtate of the patient’s ſtrength at the time.</p><p>Cupping is, in theſe caſes, much ſuperior to leeches, becauſe it is more expeditious, and becauſe of the ſwelling occaſioned by the application of any conſiderable number of<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0112.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0106"/>
theſe animals proves frequently very troubleſome, and ſometimes interrupts for a time the uſe of other remedies.</p><p>Upon the anterior part of the joint, where the cupping- glaſſes have not been placed, a ſmall bliſter ſhould be directly applied, and the part kept open with issue-ointment, till the wounds from the ſcarificator are ſo far healed that a veſicatory may likewiſe be laid on one side of the joint ; and so ſoon as that is nearly healed, the other side ſhould be alſo bliſtered. By thus alternately applying them, firſt to the one side and then to the other, almoſt a constant ſtimulus is kept up ; which, in deep-ſeated inflammations, ſeems to have fully a greater influence than all the diſcharge occaſioned by bliſters. Gentle cooling laxatives at proper intervals are alſo of uſe ; and the patient ſhould, in every reſpect, be kept upon a ſtrict antiphlogiſtic courſe, both as to diet and every other circumſtance.</p><p>It is in the firſt ſtages only of the diſeaſe that ſuch a courſe can be of much ſervice ; and in ſuch it has frequently been a means of curing diſorders which otherwiſe might have proceeded to the laſt ſtages of white ſwellings.</p><p>The original inflammatory affection being once over, theſe sort of drains ſeem to have little or no influence, and ought not then to be long perſiſted in, as they prevent the uſe of other remedies, which, in an advanced ſtate of the diſeaſe, are commonly more efficacious.</p><p>The inflammation being moſtly gone, and while there are yet no appearances of the formation of matter, mercury has ſometimes been known of uſe ; not given ſo as to ſalivate, but merely to affect the mouth gently, and to keep it somewhat ſore for a few weeks.</p><p>The beſt form of uſing it is by way of unction, as it allows, at the ſame time, the application of friction ; which, in all ſuch ſwellings, may of itſelf be in ſome meaſure conſidered as a remedy. For this purpoſe, an ointment of quickſilver and hog’s lard ſhould be prepared ; but with ſo ſmall a proportion of the former, that the patient may admit of two drams of the ointment being rubbed in three times a-day. In order to rub that quantity of the medicine in with gentle friction, an hour each time is at leaſt neceſſary ; for in the ordinary way of continuing friction for a few minutes only, it can ſeldom have much influence.</p><p>By Le Dran, and other French writers, falls of warm water on ſwellings of this nature are much recommended ; and there is no doubt, that a long continued and reiterated application of that remedy may, in the firſt ſtages of ſuch complaints, be often attended with very good effects. By a proper uſe of theſe different applications, viz. of the ſeveral topical remedies in the firſt or inflammatory ſtate of the diſeaſe, and afterwards (ſtill, however, before the formation of matter) of mercurials, friction, &amp;c. many affections of this nature have been entirely removed.</p><p>It frequently happens, by the bent poſition the limb has been for a long time kept in, that the uſe of the joint comes to be entirely loſt, having often acquired ſuch a degree of ſtiffneſs, that any attempts to move it are commonly attended with very great pain. This has been conſtantly attributed to one or other of two different cauſes, which are both in their nature incurable, viz. either to the ends of ſuch bones as compoſe the joints having run into one another, ſo as to become firmly conjoined in conſequence of the ſurrounding cartilages being abraded ; or to the inſpiſſation, as it is termed, of the ſynovia of the joints, whereby their cavities are entirely filled up, and no ſpace left for the future motion of the bones.</p><p>Both theſe opinions, however, are in general very ill founded : as the ſtiffneſs almoſt always proceeds from a contraction of the muſeles and tendons. It may often be cured by a long continued uſe of emollients.</p><p>The beſt emollient that can be uſed is pure olive oil applied warm ; as much of it as can be eaſily rubbed in by an hour’s gentle friction ſhould be regularly done at leaſt three times a-day ; and inſtead of confining the friction altogether to the rigid tendons, it ſhould be extended over the whole muſeles, even to the inſertions of their other extremities ; but more eſpecially on their fleſhy muſcular parts, where the principal cauſe of the continuance of ſuch complaints is probably ſeated.</p><p>The web or omentum of a new-killed ſheep, or of any other animal, applied over all the diſeaſed parts directly on being cut out of the animal, is ſometimes attended with advantage. The application ſhould be renewed as frequently as poſſible, once a day at leaſt, or oftener when it can be done ; for on being more than four or five hours applied it becomes diſagreeable ; and after that time, indeed, as it commonly turns ſtiff, it cannot then probably be of much ſervice.</p><p>The diſorder has hitherto been ſuppoſed not to be ſo far advanced as to have occaſioned the formation of matter ; for when come that length, no conſiderable advantages can be expected from any of the remedies as yet recommended : but even in that ſtate of the complaint, if the patient’s health does not abſolutely require it, amputation of the member ſhould not be immediately had recourſe to. For by opening the different abſcesses ſoon after their formation, the matter may be prevented from deſtroying the capſular ligaments of the joints, which, if once effected, would no doubt render that operation necessary, Even in point of ſucceſs from the operation, it ought never to be adviſed till the complaint is pretty far advanced. For in this diſorder, eſpecially, a greater proportion of patients have recovered after amputation, who have previouſly been conſiderably reduced by diarrhoeas and other weakening ſymptoms, than of ſuch as have ſtill remained in a full plethoric habit of body.”</p><p>All the different obſervations hitherto made upon the treatment, relate particularly to the rheumatic ſpecies of the diſorder ; and when had recourſe to in time, and duly perſiſted in, they will frequently be found of ſervice : but when the diſeaſe is ſo far advanced as to have deſtroyed the capſular ligaments of the joint, and perhaps even the cartilages and bones themſelves, amputation of the member is then no doubt the only reſource.</p><p>In the ſcrophulous white ſwellings, when the diſeaſed parts of the bone begin to cast off, a cure may in that way, by aſſiſting the efforts of nature, be ſometimes obtained in the ſmall joints ; but in all the large joints, as the knee, ankle, &amp;c. it is not probable that any other reſource than amputation will ever afford much relief. And even the effects of that operation can ſeldom be depended on as laſting ; for when the general ſcrophulous taint ſtill ſubſiſts in the conſtitution, the diſorder will moſt probably appear again in ſome other part ; which, however, in the advanced ſtages of the diſeaſe, it is ſometimes necessary to run the riſk of, the pain being often ſo tormenting as to make it more eligible to ſubmit to any hazard rather than to bear it longer.</p><p>When, however, for ſome reaſon or other, amputation is dctermined againſt, as there being almoſt a certainty of the complaint ſoon returning, from the ſcrophulous diſpoſition appearing very ſtrong in the ſyſtem, it then becomes neceſſary to have recourſe to palliatives, ſo as to render the complaint as tolerable as poſſible : and with this view, opiates in large doſes, by moderating the pain and procuring reſt to the patient, will in general be found the principal remedy. In other reſpects, all ſuch medicines and articles of regimen as are found beneficial in ſcrophula, may be had recourſe to.<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0113.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0107"/>
<hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Of Cancers.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cancers</hi> moſt commonly ariſe in the glandular parts of the body, where they are occasioned by any bruiſe or contuſion, ſometimes a very slight one : and hence they are more common in the lips, and in the breaſts of women, than in any other parts of the body. Cancers have been generally diſtinguiſhed into <hi rend="italic">occult</hi> and <hi rend="italic">open.</hi> By the former are meant ſuch hard ſcirrhous ſwellings as are attended with frequent ſhooting pains, and which at laſt generally terminate in the latter.</p><p>By the <hi rend="italic">open cancerous ulcer,</hi> is underſtood that ſpecies of ſore which commonly ſucceeds to hard swellings of the glands ; although in ſome inſtances it occurs without any previous hardneſs. The edges of the ulcer are hard, ragged, and unequal, very painful, and reverſe in different ways, being ſometimes turned upwards and backwards, and on other occaſions inwards. The whole ſurface of the ſore is commonly very unequal, there being in ſome parts conſiderable riſings, and in others deep excavations. The diſcharge, for the moſt part, is a thin dark-coloured fetid ichor ; and is often possessed of ſuch a degree of acrimony as to excoriate, and even deſtroy, the neighbouring parts. In the more advanced ſtages of the diſeaſe, by the erosion of blood- vessels which occurs, conſiderable quantities of pure blood are ſometimes alſo diſcharged.</p><p>Patients labouring under real cancerous affections univerſally complain of a <hi rend="italic">burning</hi> heat over the whole ulcerated ſurface; which, in general, is the moſt tormenting ſymptom that attends the diſorder ; and thoſe ſhooting lancinating pains, which were troubleſome in the more occult ſtate of the complaint, become now a great deal more ſo.</p><p>Theſe are the moſt frequent ſymptoms which attend an ulcerated cancer ; but the appearances of ſuch sores are ſo various, that it is almoſt impoſſible in any deſcription to comprehend every one. When two, three, or more, however, of thoſe enumerated, concur together in the ſame ulcer, we may always be pretty certain of its being of the cancerous kind.</p><p>Concerning the cauſes of cancers, there have been a great many conjectures, but without any ſolid foundation. It is of ſome moment, however, to deternine whether they ariſe from ſome general diſorder in the ſyſtem, or whether they are only to be accounted local diſeaſes. Many of the moſt eminent practitioners have been of opinion that they ariſe from a general diſorder of the ſyſtem ; and hence conſider them as totally incurable even by extirpation, as the latent seeds of the diſeaſe, in their opinion, will not fail to bring on a return of it ſomewhere or other. Of this opinion the late Dr Monro appears to have been ; and in a paper on this ſubject in the Edinburgh Medical Essays, declares, that " of near 60 cancers which he had been preſent at the extirpation of, only four patients remained free of the diſeaſe at the end of two years.” From this bad ſucceſs, and the violent progreſs of the diſeaſe, he finally concludes againſt the extirpation of cancers, and propoſes only the palliative method of cure. But later practitioners have been a great deal more ſucceſsful ; and a late publication by Mr Hill, ſurgeon at Dumfries, has put the uſefulneſs of extirpation beyond a doubt, when the operation is performed in time : though, after the diſeaſe has continued long, and the virus been abſorbed, the whole ſyſtem acquires a cancerous diſpoſition, and the diſeaſe almoſt certainly recurs in ſome other part. From internal medicines we can expect little or nothing in the cure of cancers ; and external applications can do no more than palliate. Great expectations were formed from the powder and extract of cicuta; but it has so univerſally failed, that few put much confidence in it at present. However, it has ſometimes been of ſervice in caſes oſ a simple indurated gland ; and even where the diſeaſe has been farther advanced, it has produced a better diſcharge, and diminiſhed the fetor of the ſore ; but as it cannot be depended upon for a radical cure, a delay of the operation is never to be recommended.</p><p>No part of the body is more ſubject to cancer than the breaſts of women. Cancer of the mamma may ariſe at any period of life, though it ſeldom appears till about the time the menſes uſually diſappear. Tumors ariſing in the breaſt previous to this period have been conſidered by ſome practitioners as being only of a ſcrophulous nature ; and it is probably owing to that circumſtance that ſeveral cures have been of late years made on tumors of the breaſt by mercurial frictions and other remedies.</p><p>Scirrhus and cancer of the breaſts are diſtinguiſhed by the following marks : When the tumor is firſt obſerved, it is commonly in form of a ſmall hard knot in the glandular part of the mamma, while the ſkin at the ſame time is free from inflammation. It frequently continues in this ſtate for ſeveral months : by degrees, however, it increaſes conſiderably in ſize, and at laſt a ſharp pain is felt shooting towards the axilla. The lymphatic glands at the under edge of the pectoral muſcle and in the axilla are often enlarged, and an occult cancer is now formed. By degrees the integuments over this part of the tumor in the mamma become diſcoloured, and at laſt an ulceration or open cancer breaks out. Violent hemorrhagies now frequently enſue ; the pain becomes ſtill more excruciating ; and, unleſs proper aſſiſtance be given, the patient is generally cut off in not many months after the breaking out of the cancer.</p><p>In early ſtages, the diſeaſe in general may be conſidered as entirely a local affection, and a radical cure may be of courſe expected ; but in proportion as the ſkin ſhall afterwards be found diſeaſed and adhering to the gland, and that to the pectoral muſcle, and the lymphatic glands near the mamma and in the arm-pit ſwelled, the chance of a cure becomes more doubtful, as the cancerous matter may have been abſorbed, and part of it carried into the ſyſtem. The moſt unfavourable ſtate for an operation is when there are ulcerations in the breaſt, large, deep, and of long ſtanding ; and particularly if theſe are attended with great pain, when the arm of the affected side has become œdematous, and the health of the patient is much impaired. In this laſt ſtate very little is to be expected from a ſurgical operation.</p><p>In extirpating the mamma, which we ſhall firſt ſuppoſe is to be done where the ſkin is found, and where the tumor has no uncommon adheſion to the pectoral muſcle, the patient ought to be placed horizontally in a bed, or upon a table covered with a mattress, &amp;c. The operator is to be ſeated, and to have proper aſſiſtants. A longitudinal inciſion is then to be made with a common ſcalpel through the ſkill and cellular ſubſtance along the whole extent of the tumor, and at a little diſtance from the nipple, which is to be ſaved. When the longeſt diameter of the tumor is acroſs the body, inſtead oſ a longitudinal inciſion, a tranſverſe one is to be made. The integuments being dissected from the mamma on both ſides of the inciſion, the patient’s arm is to be extended to ſave the pectoral muſcle ; and the whole glandular part is to be detached ſrom the muſcle, though a ſmall portion only ſhould be diſeaſed, beginning at the upper side, and ſeparating downwards. If there be any indurated glands, they are to be carefully removed. If the patient be faint, a glass of wine, or ſome other cordial, is to be given. After the diſeaſed parts are removed, the wound is to be cleaned with a ſponge wrung out of warm water, which will generally render the ſmall bleeding veſſels more conſpicuous. The integuments are next to be cloſely ap<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0114.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0108"/>
plied to the parts underneath, and retained there by the twiſted future, and likewiſe by a few adheſive ſtraps. A large pledgit of ſimple ointment is now to be laid over the whole ; and this is to be covered with a thick compress of lint, tow, or soft linen ; and the dreſſings to be kept in their place, and moderate preſſure made by the napkin and scapulary bandage.</p><p>By this method the integuments will generally ſoon adhere, and a cure will be performed by the firſt intention. But it does not often happen that the operation is performed while this favourable mode of practiſing it will anſwer.</p><p>In general, before extirpation of a breaſt is recommended by the ſurgeon, or ſubmitted to by the patient, a conſiderable portion of the external integuments are ſo much diſeaſed as to render it neceſſary to ſeparate them along with the glandular part of the mamma. It ſometimes happens likewiſe that the tumor adheres to the pectoral muſcle, and that again to the ribs. In either oſ theſe caſes it becomes neceſſary to remove all the diſeaſed parts. For this purpoſe, two inciſions of an oval form, with ſharp extremities, of a ſufficient ſize to include the whole of the affected parts, become neceſſary. If again it be found, that beſides the diſeaſe of the breaſt, the lymphatic glands in the neighbourhood are indurated, or otherwiſe diſeaſed, the firſt inciſion ought to extend at once over theſe ; and after the other parts have been removed, and the veſſels ſecured, the whole of the diſeaſed glands are to be extirpated ; and in performing this part of the operation, conſiderable aſſiſtance may be given by ſupporting them with a hook, or a ligature passed through them, till they are entirely removed. When they lie deep in the axilla, the points of the fingers, or the end of the handle, will ſometimes be ſafer than the edge of the knife. After having removed all the glands which are in the ſmalleſt degree affected, the cut edges of the ſkin are to be brought as near to each other as the nature of the caſe will allow, ſo as to heal as much as poſſible by the firſt intention. After the wound is nearly, or perhaps entirely healed, an iſſue, inserted into the arm of the oppoſite side, will be the beſt means of preventing a relapſe.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV <hi rend="italic">Burns.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> immediate conſequence of burns is a greater or leſs degree of inflammation; and the danger attending ſuch accidents is in proportion to the extent of the injury. Burns which irritate the ſkin only, without deſtroying the cuticle, act nearly in the way of a common bliſtering plaſter. When the cuticle is deſtroyed, no bliſter takes place ; a mortified slough is obſerved ; and when this ſeparates, an ulcer is left. Where the cuticle is not deſtroyed, relief may be procured by holding the part affected a conſiderable time in very cold water, or ſometimes by plunging it two or three times into water a little below the boiling point. Solutions of ſaccharum ſaturni, and other preparations of lead, have been recommended, as in the caſe of other inflammations. Vinegar is found a very effectual application, whether the ſkin be ſound or bliſtered. The part may be entirely immerſed in it, or linen rags dipt in the vinegar may be applied, and the parts kept conſtantly moiſt, till the pain be removed. The ſame application is uſeful where the ſkin is rubbed off, or otherwiſe deſtroyed. In this caſe, indeed, the vinegar is apt to give additional pain on its firſt application ; but this ſoon ceaſes, and the part becomes much cooler and eaſier. If the patient will not ſuffer the vinegar to be applied immediately to the ſurface of the ſore, a linen rag ſoaked in olive-oil may be previously laid on the part, covering the whole with the cloths dipped in vinegar ; and theſe applications are to be occaſionally repeated till the pain and inflammation be entirely removed ; after which the parts are to be dressed in the ſame manner as in the case of a common bliſter. In extenſive burns, where the irritation is great, along with external applications, opium ſhould be preſcribed, in doſes adequate to the degree of pain. Even that ſtupor with which patients in this ſituation are ſometimes attacked, is found to be more readily removed by opium than by any other remedy. With reſpect to the bliſters which ariſe upon burns, it has been diſputed whether they ought to be opened, or allowed to remain till they dry up of themſelves. But, according to the opinions of the lateſt authors, they ought to be opened as ſoon as any conſiderable quantity of fluid is found in them. After the ſerum is diſcharged, a thin liniment of wax and oil, with a little ſaccharum ſaturni, ſhould be applied to the part.</p><p>In caſes of very ſevere burns, where, notwithſtanding the above treatment, there is danger of a violent inflammation being induced, blood-letting, cooling purgatives, and other remedies adapted to the peculiar ſymptoms, muſt be uſed. When, again, burns are from the firſt attended with loſs of ſubſtance, as commonly happens after the application of hot metallic bodies, we ought to have recourſe to the vinegar, as already mentioned, or to a liniment which is now in very common uſe for ſuch purpoſes, made of equal parts of lint-seed oil and lime-water, which, when ſhaken together, forms a thick white ſubſtance, which often gives ſpeedy relief ; and it may be readily applied by daubing the parts frequently over with a ſoft pencil well ſoaked in it. Though this has been conſidered as one of the beſt applications in burns, yet, in ſome caſes, more immediate relief has been procured from the application of Goulard’s cerate, or the unguentum nutritum ; and a weak ſolution of ſaccharum ſaturni has ſometimes been of ſervice.</p><p>When burns are occaſioned by the exploſion of gunpowder, ſome of the grains of the powder are apt to be forced into the ſkin. At firſt they produce much irritation ; and if they are not removed, they commonly leave marks which remain during life. They ſhould, therefore, be picked out as ſoon as poſſible after the accident ; and to prevent inflammation, as well as to dissolve any power which may remain, the parts afflicted ſhould be covered, for a day or two, with emollient poultices. In other reſpects, injuries of this sort are to be treated like any other kind of burns.—When burnt parts are contiguous to each other, they are apt to adhere. To prevent this, pledgits covered with any proper dreſſing ought to be inſerted between them during the courſe of the cure. Ulcers ariſing from burns are apt to become ſoft and fungous, and to riſe above their natural level. When this is obſerved, the emollient ointments, which may have been previouſly uſed, ſhould be laid aſide, and thoſe of a moderately aſtringent nature applied. Gentle compreſſion with a roller is alſo of particular ſervice. Advantage is likewiſe derived from ſaturnine waffles, &amp;c. One of the beſt oiutments, in ſuch caſes, is the common calamine cerate. Theſe will commonly anſwer the purpoſe ; but when they prove inſufficient, burnt alum, blue vitriol, or even lunar cauſtic, may be neceſſary.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> V. <hi rend="italic">Of Inflammatory Tumors.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Inflammatory Tumors</hi> are ſuch as are quick in their progreſs when compared with thoſe of the indolent kind, and are attended with conſiderable pain and other ſymptoms of inflammation.

The application of cooling ſaturnine poultices is adviſable.

The bowels ſhould be kept moderately open ; the patient ſhould uſe a low diet, and keep as much as possible in an horizontal poſture. If lues venerea be preſent, a cure cannot be expected without mercury. If the diſeaſe is owing to a ſudden ſtoppage of the diſcharge in gonorrhoea, the running ought to be reſtored, and promoted by bathing the penis in warm water, injecting warm oil, and the uſe of bougies. Theſe means will generally diſcuſs the inflammation.

In discuſſing venereal buboes, the application of mercurial ointment has a conſiderable effect. After ſuppuration is completely formed, the application of cauſtic to open the bubo is dangerous, left it ſhould corrode ſome of the conſiderable blood- veſſels, which generally lie contiguous to the bubo. Buboes, when opened by the knife, are said to heal with more difficulty, and generally to leave a ſcar behind them. To allow them to burſt of themſelves, is therefore ſor the moſt part proper, except when the collection is ſo conſiderable as to press upon the neighbouring blood-veſſels. In ſuch a caſe, a ſmall inciſion may be made by the lancet, taking as much care as poſſible to prevent the admisſion of the external air into the wound. When the edges of the opening grow callous, the application of lunar cauſtic to them becomes neceſſary.

The diſeaſe has ſometimes a ſtrong reſemblance to nephritic affections, and is ſometimes miſtaken for lumbago. After ſuppuration takes place, ſhivering fits come on ; and the pain now becoming dull, the patient imagines himſelf better, till matter points at the side of the anus, or in the groin. The firſt caſe is rare ; and when it does occur, the tumor burſts, or is opened as a common abſceſs. In the other caſe, the matter is ſeated behind the faſcia of the groin, and ſometimes deſcends as far as the knee. The teguments commonly retain their natural appearance. Fluctuation is evident, eſpecially when the patient is in an upright poſture. It is often miſtaken ſor crural hernia ; but may be eaſily diſtinguiſhed from it, by its flow progreſs, by pain in the lumbar region at the commencement of the diſceaſe, by the patient allowing the tumor to be handled freely, by fluctuation being evident, by the tumor becoming flaccid when the patient is in an horizontal ſituation, and by the absence of all the ſymptoms by which hernia is diſtinguished. Both diſeaſes may occur at once ; but this is very rare, and a diſtinction is ſtill to be made.</p><p>It is diſcovered that this diſeaſe has, in general, been induced by conſiderable injury being done to the ſmall of the back or loins, either by twiſts, or ſevere bruiſes, or by ſudden expoſure to cold after the heat occaſioned by ſevere exerciſe, particularly in ſcrophulous habits. Were accidents of this nature immediately treated with that attention which their importance deferves, the diſeaſe might frequently be prevented.</p><p>In the treatment the ſtricteſt antiphlogiſtic regimen ought to be observed. Blood-letting ought immediately to be performed, by ſcarifying deeply and leeching the injured part : neither are bliſters, opiates, gentle purgatives, and other remedies uſeful in inflammations, to be neglected.</p><p>Authors have an idea that little advantage can be derived from laying open the abſceſs, on account of the great danger which may ensue from the admiſſion of air. Mr Benjamin Bell, however, is of an oppoſite opinion, and has always given vent to matter here as elſewhere, and no bad conſequences have been obſerved. The matter, when long lodged, has been found to deſtroy the ſoft parts and bones, and ſometimes to make its way into the cavity of the abdomen ; all of which might be prevented by an early evacuation. For this purpoſe a trocar ſhould be uſed, which was tried by Mr Beſt in one case with complete ſucceſs.</p><p>Some other caſes are lately narrated by authors, where, by the introduction of a ſeton, and drawing off the matter by slow degrees, and then by uſing compreſs, and ſometimes injections of gently irritating fluids, a cure has been performed in the courſe of a few months.

An effuſion of fluids always ſucceeds the injury, which ſeems to be, for the moſt part, of a ſerous nature, as the ſkin uſually retains its natural colour ; ſometimes the tumefied parts are of a deep red, or leaden colour, owing to a rupture of ſome veſſels conveying red blood.</p><p>In the treatment of contuſions and ſprains, two circumstances require attention, 1. To endeavour to prevent the ſwelling as far as is practicable ; 2. To employ thoſe remedies afterwards which are known to be moſt powerful in preventing or removing inflammation. In contuſions of the cellular ſubſtance, and even of the muſcles, the effuſed fluids are commonly ſoon abſorbed ; but in ſprains of the tendons or ligaments, a very troubleſome, painful thickneſs of the injured parts is apt to continue for a great length of time, and in ſome inſtances even for life.</p><p>It is neceſſary, therefore, to obviate theſe ſymptoms as ſoon as poſſible ; and for this purpoſe, cold aſtringent applications, as water, vinegar, &amp;c, are moſt commonly uſed.

By immerſing the injured part in theſe immediately after the injury is received, the effuſion will at leaſt be ſomewhat obviated.

They are of different kinds according to the nature of their contents, and appear in various parts of the body. They are ſeated in the adipoſe and cellular membrane ; whence it often happens that they take place in the viſcera themſelves, where they are frequently mortal.

But theſe rules are liable to conſiderable exceptions. The meliceris and atheroma are moſt commonly found upon the head, and the ſteatoma upon the other parts of the body ; while ganglions are ſituated over the tendons of the muſcles. Theſe tumors muſt be either extirpated entirely, or laid open ſo as to diſpoſe the cyſt to ſlough off or granulate. If the matter be fluid, we may evacuate it by an opening made with a lancet, or by means of a ſeton ; but as the matter is apt to collect again, it is better to remove the ſac entirely. If large veſſels or nerves prevent this from being done, then it is to be laid freely open and expoſed to the air, ſo that the bag may granulate, or be thrown off. When the tumor is to be extirpated, a longitudinal inciſion is to be made through the integuments ; after which the tumor may be frequently removed by the point of the finger, or by the end of a ſpatula, replacing the integuments with a view to heal by the firſt intention. In every pendulous tumor of this kind, with a narrow neck, we ought to divide the teguments near the bottom of the tumor, in an oval form, ſo that the wound may be afterwards properly covered with the remaining integuments. After the tumor is removed, the ſkin is to be replaced over the wound, and fixed with adheſive ſtraps, covering it with a pledgit of cerate, a ſmall compreſs of linen, with a bandage above all, to make a gentle preſſure on the parts.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">Of Steatomatous and Sarcomatous Tumors.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Steatomatous</hi> tumore have been ranked by authors among thoſe of the encyſted kind ; but they have no other cyſt containing them than the common cellular ſubſtance, ſomewhat condenſed ; and the particles of fat compoſing them are found of the ſame ſize with thoſe in a sound part of the body.</p><p>Authors formerly adviſed the diſcuſſion of ſteatoms, or the prevention of their growth, by the application of preſſure ; but by ſuch means the growth is rather promoted than retarded, nor have internal remedies been of any advantage.

They are moſt frequently met with over the tendons upon the back of the wriſt, and often likewiſe about thoſe of the ankle and other parts of the extremities. When preſſed, they are found to poſſeſs a conſiderable degree of elaſticity, from which, and from their ſituation, they may generally be diſtinguiſhed from other encyſted tumors. They ſeldom arrive at any great bulk, are not often attended with pain, and commonly the ſkin retains its natural appearance. On being laid open, they are found to contain a tough, viſcid, tranſparent fluid, reſembling the glaire of an egg.</p><p>They are generally produced by ſprains, or contuſions of the joints, or by rheumatism. in many inſtances, they go off inſenſibly, without any aſſiſtance from art ; but as this is often not the caſe, means ought to be uſed for removing them. For this purpoſe, moderate friction frequently repeated, or gentle compreſſion applied to them by means of thin plates of lead, &amp;c. ſometimes remove them. In ſome inſtances they have been removed by the application of bliſters ; but the moſt certain method is, to make a ſmall puncture into the ſac, and to draw a cord through it ; or, after the puncture is made, to preſs out the contents, and then inject ſome gently ſtimulating fluid, as port wine and water heated blood-warm. Sometimes, in tumors of this kind, bodies of a cartilaginous nature, and of different ſhapes and ſizes, are found ; ſome quite ſmooth, others with peduncles ; by which they are ſuppoſed by Dr Monro, in his work upon the bursæ mucosae, to have been attached to the bursæ. As theſe cannot be removed by any remedy with which we are yet acquainted, it is found necceſſary to diſcharge them. But as the parts may ſometimes ſuffer from inflammation when the tumor is laid fully open, it may be punctured at each end; and, after preſſing out the contents, a ſmall cord may be introduced ; after which gentle preſſure may be applied with a compreſs and bandage over the courſe of the tumor. The cord however ſhould not be continued so long as to induce any great degree of inflammation, for it is found that a slight degree of this ſufficiently anſwers the purpoſe.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Of Collections within the Capſular Ligaments of Joints, and of Cartilaginous Bodies contained there.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Collections</hi> here may conſiſt of ſerum, blood, or pus and ſynovia combined. They are moſt frequently met with in the joint of the knee, and may be produced either by internal or external cauſes. Theſe kinds of collections may in general be diſtinguiſhed from each other.</p><p>Watery effusions, commonly called <hi rend="italic">dropsical</hi> ſwellings of the joints, ariſe chiefly in conſequence of ſevere rheumatic complaints; and when the tumor is not very large, the fluctuation of the fluid may be felt by preſſure. When a large effuſion appears immediately after a violent bruiſe, it is probable that it conſiſts chiefly of blood : but when it ſucceeds a violent ſprain, attended with great pain, inflammation, and ſwelling, terminating in an effuſion, there is every reaſon to think that the contained fluid conſiſts of pus mixed with ſynovia.</p><p>Swellings of the joints are moſt apt to be confounded with collections in the bursæ mucosæ, or with matter effuſed in the adjacent cellular ſubſtance. From the firſt of theſe they are generally diſtinguiſhed by the contained fluid paſſing readily from one side of the joint to the other, and from its being diffuſed over the whole of it ; whereas, when it is contained in the bursae, the tumor is confined to a particular part, and is ſeldom attended with much pain.</p><p>When ſuch collections can ſafely be allowed to remain, the capſular ligament ought never to be opened, as they can often be removed by diſcutients. Even conſiderable collections ariſing from rheumatiirn may commonly be discuſſed by friction, fomenting the parts with warm vapour, keeping them conſtantly moiſt with ſaturnine solutions, covering them properly with flannel, and applying blisters. When theſe fail, ſupporting the part with a laced stocking, or with a roller, has frequently been of ſervice. But whether a rheumatic tumor can be discuſſed or not, it ought not to be opened ; for the inconvenience attending it is more intolerable than the pain and inflammation which may enſue. But when the matter would do miſchief by lodging, it ſhould be diſcharged. Effuſed blood and matter which ſucceed high degrees of inflammation are of this kind. Blood is frequently extravaſated among ſoft parts without much detriment ; but when in contact with cartilage or bone, it ſoon hurts them materially. The matter ought to be diſcharged ſo as moſt effectually to prevent the admiſſion of air into the cavity of the joint. For this purpose the opening ſhould be made with a trocar ; and the ſkin, previouſly drawn tight to the upper part of the tumor, ſhould be pulled down immediately on withdrawing the canula. A piece of adheſive plaſter ſhould be directly laid over the opening, and the whole joint ſhould be firmly supported by a flannel roller properly applied. If thc patient be plethoric, he ſhould be blooded to ſuch an extent as his ſtrength will bear ; he ſhould be put upon a strict antiphlogistic regimen, and in every reſpect ſhould be managed with caution ; for inflammation being very apt to enlue, we cannot too much guard againſt it.</p><p>Joints are ſometimes rendered painful and ſtiff by the formation of different ſubſtances within the capſular ligaments. Theſe are ſometimes looſe, and as firm as cartilage ; and ſometimes of a ſoft membranous nature, ſimilar to thoſe already obſerved in treating of ſwellings of the burſae mucosæ.</p><p>In ſome caſes theſe ſubſtances, eſpecially the laſt ſpecies, retain nearly the ſame ſituation, without being much affected either by preſſure or by the motion of the joint ; in that caſe the pain is constant, but ſeldom ſevere. The firſt ſpecies, however, is commonly very moveable ; and on being touched, they slip with ſuch facility that it is difficult to fix them even with the fingers. Theſe are only painful in particular ſituations.</p><p>Where theſe concretions appear, upon examination, to be perfectly looſe and detached, if the pain which they excite is very ſevere, we ſhould venture in a cautious manner to take them out, by making an inciſion into the joint. But if there is reaſon to ſuspect that they are connected with any part of the joint, the patient ought to be adviſed to ſubmit to the pain they induce, which in general will be rendered moderate by ſhunning exerciſe ; but if, notwithstanding this, it becomes insupportable, amputation is the only reſource.</p><p>The limb being firmly ſecured by aſſiſtants, in that poſture which admits of the body to be taken out being felt<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0118.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0112"/>
moſt diſtinctly, the ſurgeon ſhould endeavour to fix it with his fingers towards the upper part of the joint, after an aſſiſtant has drawn the ſkin as much as poſſible upwards from the part where the inciſion is to be made. The operator with a ſcalpel is now to make an inciſion through the teguments and capſular ligament, directly upon the ſubſtance itſelf, of ſuch a ſize as will admit of its being eaſily taken out ; which may be done either with the finger or with the end of a blunt probe. If it is found to be connected by any ſmall filaments either to the capſular ligament or to the cartilages of the joint, they ſhould be cautiously divided, either with a probe-pointed biſtoury, or probe-pointed ſciſſars, after drawing the ſubſtance itſelf as far out as it can be got. When more concretions than one are found, they ſhould all be taken out at the ſame opening, when this can be done ; but when it cannot, it will be better to allow the firſt inciſion to heal before attempting the second, ſo as to avoid as much as poſſible the exciting of inflammation.</p><p>After the concretion is removed, the ſkin ſhould be immediately drawn over the wound in the capſular ligament ; and the lips of the opening in the ſkin being laid together, they ſhould be ſecured in this ſituation by pieces of adhesive plaſter, ſo as to prevent the air from finding acceſs to the cavity of the joint. Till the wound be completely healed, the patient ſhould not only be confined to bed, but the limb ſhould be kept as much as poſſible in one poſture, and a ſtrict antiphlogiſtic regimen ſhould be preſerved.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV. <hi rend="italic">Oſ Spina Bifida.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Spina bifida,</hi> is a tumor which ſometimes appears upon the lower part of the ſpine in new-born children. A fluctuation is diſtinctly perceived in it, and the fluid it contains can in ſome measure be pressed in at an opening between the vertebras. In ſome caſes this opening is owing to a natural deficiency of bone ; in others, to the ſeparation of the spinous proceſſes of the vertebrae.</p><p>The diſeaſe proceeds ſrom ſerum collected within the coverings of the ſpinal marrow. It is always fatal. Children labouring under it have been known to live for two or three years ; but, in general, they linger and die in a few weeks. All that art has been able to do is to ſupport the tumor by gentle preſſure with a proper bandage. When a tumor of this kind is laid open or bursts, the child dies in a few hours. A tumor nearly of the ſame nature with this is ſometimes met with upon different parts of the head in newborn children : it is formed by a fluid lodged beneath the membranes of the brain, which have been forced out at ſome unoſſified part of the ſkull. What we have ſaid with reſpect to the former is exactly applicable to this.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V. <hi rend="italic">Of Scrophulous Tumors.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi> ſhall here only mention the ſurgical treatment of ſcrophulous tumors, having ſpoken of ſcrophula in general under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Medicine.</hi> Some practitioners have recommended poultices, &amp;c. to bring ſcrophulous tumors to ſuppuration ; but the beſt practitioners have laid them aſide, becauſe they increaſe the ſoft and ſpongy ſtate of the parts, by which they are prevented from healing.</p><p>As external applications are ineffectual, it is better to allow ſcrophulous tumors to be as much expoſed as poſſible, as this frequently renders the ſubſequent ulcer more eaſily cured. The other methods recommended for diſcuſſing theſe tumors are, the internal uſe of cicuta, burnt ſponge, muriated barytes, a long continued uſe of the cold bath, particularly of ſea-bathing, and drinking mineral or ſea-water. Theſe, to produce any effect, ſhould be begun early, while the tumors are ſmall, and long persiſted in. When the tumors come to a ſtate of ſuppuration, if they are ſeated upon the thorax or abdomen, or any of the large joints, free vent ought always to be given to the matter to prevent its burſting into theſe cavities ; and when the abſceſs is large, this ſhould be done with a trocar, or by paſſing a cord thro' it, in order to exclude the external air. When the tumors are not ſituated upon great cavities, it is better to allow them to break of themſelves, as the sores commonly heal more readily, and the ſcar is pretty ſimilar in both. The moſt proper applications to ſcrophulous sores ſeem to be thoſe of the ſaturnine kind, as they diminiſh inflammation, and in ſome meaſure prevent the ſore from ſpreading. When the bones become carious, they are to be treated like carious bones from other cauſes ; but amputation cannot here be attended with advantage, as the diſeaſe proceeds from a fault in the conſtitution. After the sores are healed up, the introduction of an iſſue may aſſiſt in preventing their return.</p><p>Tumors of a ſcrophulous nature are ſometimes apt to be miſtaken ſor thoſe of the ſcirrhous kind, and thus may be improperly extirpated. Scrophulous tumors deeply ſeated commonly have a degree of firmneſs, which, if they happen to be ſeated near a ſuſpicious part, as cloſe by the side of a woman’s breaſt, may give occaſion to ſuch a miſtake. But they may generally be diſtinguiſhed by the ſoftneſs even of the firmeſt kind of them, when compared with ſcirrhus. They have always a ſmooth equal ſurface ; whereas ſcirrhus is ſomewhat unequal or knotty, and ſeated in the real ſubſtance of the gland ; and a ſhooting pain is commonly felt in it from time to time, even from its firſt appearance. They are generally accompanied, too, with other ſymptoms of ſcrophula, which is not necessarily the caſe with ſcirrhus.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V. <hi rend="italic">Of Bronchocele.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> is a tumor on the fore-part of the neck, ſeated between the trachea and ſkin, termed in French <hi rend="italic">goitre.</hi> In this country it is very rare ; but it is frequent among the inhabitants of the Alps, and other mountainous countries, and is ſuppoſed to be owing to the uſe of snow-water. It is ſeated moſt frequently in the thyroid gland ; tho’ in two caſes examined by Mr Benjamin Bell this gland was diminiſhed from the compreſſion of the tumor, which was chiefly formed of condenſed cellular ſubſtance, with effusions in different parts of it of a viſcid brown matter. Dr Prosser considers bronchocele as a dropſical affection of the thyroid gland ; and in confirmation of this, he gives an account of a dissection of a diſeaſed gland of this kind by Dr Hunter, who found in it a great number of capſules filled with water. The ſwelling is at firſt ſoft, without pain or any evident fluctuation, and the ſkin retains its natural appearance ; but as the tumor advances in size, it becomes unequally hard ; the ſkin acquires a copper colour, and the veins of the neck become varicoſe ; the face becomes flushed, and the patient complains of frequent headachs, as well as of ſtinging pains through the body of the tumor.</p><p>Calcined egg-ſhells have been recommended by authors as a ſpecific for this diſeaſe ; but little dependence is to be placed on ſuch a remedy. Frequent frictions are found uſeful, eſpecially when employed early ; ſaponaceous and mercurial plaſters, too, have in ſome caſes proved ſerviceable ; and repeated bliſters have been known to retard its progreſs. In the enlarged ſtate of the tumor no remedy yet known is powerful enough to diſcuſs it. When the diſeaſe is far advanced, the removal of the tumor by an operation muſt be attended with great danger, on account of the enlarged ſtate of the arteries, as well as its vicinity to the common carotids.

be adviſable to attempt extirpation, and that the patient ſhould rather trust to the common palliative treatment.

They are of various forms ; their colour is likewiſe various ; though moſt frequently reſembling that of claret or red port-wine. Many of theſe marks are perfectly flat, and never rise above the level of the ſkin : theſe do not require the aſſiſtance of ſurgery ; but in ſome caſes they appear in the form of ſmall protuberances, which frequently increaſe to a great ſize in the courſe of a few months. They appear to be sum and fleſhy. They ſometimes hang by ſlender attachments to the contiguous parts, but more generally they are fixed by broad baſes. They may be removed with as little danger as any other tumor of the ſarcomatous kind. They are ſupplied indeed more plentifully with blood than moſt other tumors are ; and even ſometimes they appear to be entirely formed by a congeries of ſmall blood-veſſels ; but the arteries which ſupply them may, for the moſt part, eaſily be ſecured by ligature. The operation ſhould never be long delayed ; for as the ſize of the veſſels corresponds with that of the tumor, they ſometimes are ſo large as to throw out a good deal of blood before they can be ſecured. In performing it, the tumor is to be cut out, the arteries taken up, and the remaining ſkin brought as well together as the nature of the part will allow, and kept ſo by adheſive plaſter or future. When the tumor is pendulous, and connected only by a narrow neck, it ſhould be extirpated by ligature.</p><p>Corns are ſmall hard tubercles, commonly ſituated on the toes or other parts of the feet, and ſometimes on the hands. They are of a horny nature. They proceed ſrom a diſeaſed ſtate of the cuticle, occaſioned by pressure. The part becomes hard and thickened, with a ſmall white ſubſtance in the centre, which has a dispoſition to become prominent. It likewiſe forms a depreſſion in the ſubjacent cutis vera, and ſometimes is ſaid to penetrate it. When corns are ſituated on parts much exposed to preſſure, they irritate the ſkin, and produce an increaſed ſenſibility of the part, and thus occaſion much pain. The beſt preventative of corns is the wearing of wide ſhoes, and avoiding every kind of preſſure ; and unleſs this be attended to, it will be found difficult to keep free from them. Various remedies are recommended ſor the cure or removal of corns. One is to bathe the part about half an hour in warm water, then to pare as much off them as poſſible without giving pain, and to apply over them any emollient ointment. If this treatment be frequently repeated, while preſſure from ſhoes is prevented, they generally fall off, and do not return if preſſure be afterwards avoided. Another method is to allow them to grow to ſome length through pieces of perforated leather, properly ſecured by plaſter or by any other means, and afterwards to cut round their root, by which they may for the moſt part be eaſily turned out. Or if ſuch irritating ſubſtances be applied to them as will raiſe a bliſter by ſeparating the cuticle from the cutis, the corn will be raised along with the cuticle, and may then be readily removed by a ſcalpel or ſcissars. The ſurface of the cutis being now expoſed, is to be healed like any other part that has been bliſtered.</p><p>Warts are ſmall, hard, indolent tumors, with a rough ſurface, appearing on different parts of the body, chiefly the hands and face, and more commonly in young people, When they appear in advanced life they are apt to degenerate into cancer, eſpecially when of a livid colour and with a ſmooth surface. If they do not prove troubleſome, nothing ſhould be done to them, as they generaly either fall off or waſte gradually away. When from their ſize or ſituation they require to be removed, this, if they are pendulous or have narrow necks, is eaſily done by ligature ; but if their baſes be broad, the ſcalpel or eſcharotic applications will be neceſſary. As few, however, will ſubmit to the former, the latter are generally employed. Eſcharotics of a mild nature give leaſt pain, and are leaſt apt to excite inflammation, which in theſe caſes it is difficult to remove, and are found to be quite ſufficient for the purpoſe. One of the beſt of theſe is crude sal ammoniac: it ſhould firſt be moiſtened in water, and then well rubbed upon the warts two or three times a-day. Liquid ſalt of tartar, and sometimes spirit of hartſhorn, has anſwered the ſame purpoſe : ſome recommend alſo the juice of onions.</p><p>Warts appearing on the penis as a ſymptom of venereal infection, are of the ſame nature, and to be cured by the ſame means. Mercury is of no advantage here, and commonly indeed does harm. When every other part of the diſeaſe is eradicated, the warts may generally be removed by waſhing them morning and evening in lime-water, or in a weak ſolution of ſaccharum ſaturni. They may be removed alſo by the knife, and the parts from whence they are cut afterwards touched with lunar cauſtic, to prevent them from returning : but when this method is practiſed, the operator ought to be certain that he has removed the wart entirely, for where part has been left the moſt formidable ſymptoms have ſometimes enſued.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VII. <hi rend="italic">Of Polypi.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Polypi</hi> are pendulous, fleſhy, indolent tumors, ſo called from their ſuppoſed reſemblance to the animal of that name. They may be found in different cavities of the body, and originate from the lining membrane ; but thoſe which come under ſurgical treatment are found in the noſe, mouth, throat, and outer paſſage of the ear, and in the vagina and rectum. They are divided into two claſſes ; the one ſoft and compreſſible, the other extremely firm. Both of them bleed on being fretted or roughly handled. The ſoft kind ſhrivels and contracts in a dry atmoſphere, (this is particularly the caſe with thoſe of the noſe) ; but the firm are not affected by the influence of the weather. Their colour is commonly pale and tranſparent, and ſometimes a deep red.</p><p>The pain at the commencement of the diſorder is always inconſiderable ; but increaſes in thoſe of a hard nature as they increaſe in ſize. Sometimes polypi of this kind become unequal, and form ulcers over the whole ſurface, diſcharging fetid matter in conſiderable quantity.

The ſoft kind being ſeldom painful, may be removed at any period with little danger; but the hard kind are generally not only painful, but more apt to degenerate into cancer, or to return after being removed. The ſoft kind therefore may be removed in general with ſucceſs; but when polypi of a harder nature exiſt, the prognoſis will be much more unfavourable.<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0120.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0114"/>
With reſpect to the treatment.·—As long as they remain ſtationary, they are not to be touched ; but when they continue to grow, we ought to uſe aſtringent remedies, eſpecially a ſtrong ſolution of alum, a decoction of oak bark, vinegar, ardent ſpirits, &amp;c. The ſofter kinds of polypi may frequently be prevented for a long time from increaſing in ſize, and ſometimes they even become conſiderably ſmaller. Mercury has been found rather to make them worſe ; cauſtic and other corroding applications have been of uſe in the ſofter kind, though they have not produced a cure. Setons have likewiſe been uſed with little advantage. It is therefore found neceſſary to have recourſe to a more effectual practice; and with this view the knife, ſciſſars, forceps, or ligature, are more generally recommended. The knife and ſciſſars may be uſed when the roots of the tumor can be readily come at ; but polypi are ſeldom ſo ſituated as to render exciſion practicable ; and even when they are, the hemorrhagy may be attended with conſiderable danger. The removal of a polypus by tearing or twitting it with the forceps, Plate CCCCLXXXVΠ. fig. 4. is occaſionally practiſed; but as ligatures are leſs painful, and fully as effectual, they are now more generally employed. The ligatures conſiſt of wire, catgut, ſilk cord, &amp;c. Different methods have been employed for paſſing theſe over polypi, according to their different ſituations.</p><p>When the ligature is to be applied, it is to be passed double over the tumor, and conducted to the root of it by means of the fingers or by ſlit probes, as in Plate CCCCLXXXVII. fig. 5. or rings, Plate CCCCLXXXVII. fig. 6. as may be beſt ſuited to the ſhape and ſize of the paſſage. The ends of the ligature are then to be introduced into a ſingle or double canula, as in Plate CCCCLXXXVII. fig. 7. which is to be puſhed along the oppoſite side of the polypus till the end of the canula teach the root of it, when the ligature is to be drawn ſomewhat tight, and fastened to the canula which is to be left in the paſſage. The ligature is to be daily tightened till the tumor drop off. In this manner the largeſt polypus may be removed equally well with thoſe of a ſmaller ſize. Should any part of it remain, it may be destroyed by cauſtic, and different inſtruments are contrived ſor conducting this to the root of the tumor.</p><p>What has been ſaid of the treatment of polypi in general, readily applies to thoſe ſeated in the noſe, outer paſſage of the ear, the rectum, and the vagina. It likewiſe applies to thoſe in the throat ; only that inſtead of paſſing the ligature through the mouth, it is to be passed through one of the noſtrils. The operator is then to introduce one or two of his fingers into the mouth, and open the doubling of the ligature, which he is to paſs over the polypus, and having pressed it down to the root of it, to proceed as before directed.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> VII. <hi rend="italic">Of Diſeaſes of the Bones.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> bones, as well as the ſofter parts, are liable to be swelled, either throughout their whole length, or to have tumors formed on particular parts of them.</p><p>Exoſtoſis is one ſpecies of tumor of the bone. According to Mr Bromefield, no ſwelling ſhould be called ſo, but an excrescence continued from a bone, like a branch from the trunk of a tree. Under this head therefore is ranked the <hi rend="italic">benign node,</hi> which may be produced by external injury, ſuch as contuſions and fractures : it can hardly be called a diſeaſe, as pain ſeldom ſucceeds, but rather a deformity.</p><p>There are riſings or tumors observable on the bones which are often the conſequents of venereal virus, and are termed <hi rend="italic">tophi, gummi,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">nodes.—</hi> Tophus is a ſoft tumor in the bone; and ſeems to be formed of a chalky ſubſtance, that is intermediate between the offeous fibres. Theſe cretaceous extravaſations are ſometimes found on the ligaments and tendons, as well as on the bone ; and may ſometimes be taken out by the knife. We have many inſtances where chalk ſtones in gouty people make their way out through the skin of the fingers and toes.</p><p>Gummi is a ſoft tumor on the ſurface of the bone, between it and the perioſteum ; and its contents resemble gum ſoftened, from whence it has taken its name. Poſſibly, by obstruction in the nutrient veſſels of the bone, a rupture of ſome of them occaſions the ſerous liquor to eſcape, which, by making its way between the fibres of the bone, arrives at its ſurface ; and being detained by the reſistance of the perioſteum, its moſt liquid parts being evaporated, and the remainder condenſed by the inflammation, and conſequently this inelaſtic covering being ſtretched, it becomes inſpissated, and forms this ſpecies of exostosis <hi rend="italic">,</hi> as it is generally called. When this is the cauſe, and the indiſpoſition of the habit in general got the better of, pressure by a ſteel infiniment, adapted to the part affected, is the proper cure.</p><p>The confirmed venereal node has the appearance of a divarication of the oſſeous fibres, probably from ſome inſpiſſated humour obſtructing the nutrient veſſels, but not extravaſated ; this occaſioning an extenſion of the perioſteum, produces a violent pain, which, when nocturnal, is the characteriſtic of a venereal cauſe. When the perioſteum is thickened, but the bone not affected, a courſe of mercury, by attenuating the obſtructed humour, and fitting it to be carried out of the body by the proper outlets, will often produce a perfect cure : but when the bone itſelf is diseased, this method will fail. But here the diviſion of the extended perioſteum has been known to give perfect eaſe.</p><p>The uſual method, formerly, was to apply a cauſtic equal to the extent of the node, which being laid bare, required exfoliation before it could be cicatrized. If the inciſion is made early, that is, before matter be formed under the inveſting membrane, it ſeldom requires exfoliation ; and, as we often find that the bone itſelf is not affected, but only the perioſteum thickened, we may be deceived even after a careful examination : it is therefore proper that the patient ſhould be pretty far advanced in a courſe of mercurial unction before even the inciſion is made ; for, ſhould the tumor decreaſe, and the pain abate during the courſe, chirurgical aſſiſtance, with the knife, moſt likely may become unneceſſary.</p><p>A bone may become carious firſt in its internal parts ; and that from external injury, as well as from a vitiated ſtate of the animal-fluids. Authors ſeem not to agree as to the technical term for this kind of diſeaſe of the bones ; ſome calling it <hi rend="italic">cancer</hi> or <hi rend="italic">gangraena ossis ;</hi> others, <hi rend="italic">ſpina ventosa,</hi> from the pointed extuberances uſually attendant on this diſorder of the bone ; and ſome again <hi rend="italic">teredo,</hi> from the appearance of the carious bone, like wood that is worm-eaten.</p><p>It is univerſally allowed, that this diſeaſe takes its riſe from matter being formed either in the diploe, or in the marrow : whenever obſtruction is begun in the veſſels expanded on, or terminating in, the medullary cyſts, the conſequence will be inflammation, and, if not early removed, matter will form ; for this reaſon this caſe may be called <hi rend="italic">abscessus in medulla.</hi> Whenever, then, a patient complains of dull heavy pain, deeply ſituated in the bone, poſſibly conſequent to a violent blow received on the part ſome time before, though the integuments appear perfectly ſound, and the bone itſelf not in the leaſt injured, we have great reaſon to ſuſpect an abſceſſus in the medulla. Children of a bad habit of body, though they have not ſuffered any external injury, will often become lame, and complain of the limb being remarkably heavy ; and though not attended with acute<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0121.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0115"/>
pain, yet the dull throbbing uneaſineſs is constant. If rigors happen during the time the patient labours under this indiſpoſition, it generally implies that matter will be formed within the ſubſtance of the bone. If the extremities of the bone complained of begin, or if it becomes enlarged throughout its whole extent, it may be known to be an abſceſsus in medulla, or true spina ventoſa, as it is called : if neither of theſe ſymptoms take place, the great inſenſibility of the bone in ſome ſubjects will prevent that acuteneſs of pain uſual in other parts where matter is formed, though the acrid matter is eroding the bone during the whole time it is contained within it. This matter at length having made its way through, arrives at the perioſteum, where it creates moſt violent pain, as well from its ſharpneſs as from its increaſed quantity, occaſioning an extenſion of the perioſteum. The integuments then become ſwelled and inflamed, and have a sort of emphyſematous feel. On being examined by preſſure, the tumor will ſometimes be leſſened, from part of the matter retiring into the bone : from this appearance to the touch, moſt likely the name of <hi rend="italic">ventoſa</hi> was added to the term <hi rend="italic">ſpina.</hi> When we are aſſured of matter being under the perioſteum, we cannot be too early in letting it out, as it will lave a conſiderable deal of pain to the patient, though probably it may not be of any conſiderable advantage in respect to the carious bone ; for, where the fluids in general are vitiated, no chance of cure can be expected from topical remedies ; but where the conſtitution is mended, nature will ſometimes aſtoniſh us in her part, as the carious bone will be thrown off from the epiphyſes, or the teredines will be filled up by the oſſific matter that slows from the parts of the bone where ſome of the spinæ have come away.</p><p>If proper medicines are given, the children well ſupported, and the parts kept clean and dry, patience and perſeverance will frequently give great credit to the ſurgeon. In caſe it ſhould have been thought adviſable to apply a trephine, to give free diſcharge to the matter, the waſhing it away, as well as the ſmall crumblings of the carious bone, by means of deterſive and drying injections, has been known to contribute greatly to the curing this kind of caries, after the habit of body in general had been mended.</p><p>Beſides thoſe above-mentioned, the bones are liabe to two oppoſite diſeaſes ; the one termed friabilitas <hi rend="italic">,</hi> the other <hi rend="italic">mollities ;</hi> the former peculiar to adults, the latter more frequent in infants, though ſometimes ſeen in adults, from a vitiated ſtate of their juices.</p><p>The bones, when deprived of their cementing liquor, by paſſing through fire, become friable. From repeated ſalivations, and in old people, they have been rendered extremely brittle ; insomuch that in many ſubjects they have been fractured merely from their weight and the action of the muſcles : but in ſuch caſes, this is not owing to the friability of the bones, but to the loſs of ſubſtance, from the eroſion of the bone by an acrimonious humour thrown on it ; to which cauſe perhaps may be attributed the diſeaſe called <hi rend="italic">rickets</hi> in children. The effects of ſcorbutic humour in rendering the bones ſoft in many inſtances, have often been remarked.</p><p>By proper diet, gentle friction with coarſe cloths, exerciſe, and cold bathing, rickety children will frequently get their conſtitution ſo much changed, as that, by the time they arrive at the age of 20 years, there ſhall not remain the leaſt veſtige of their former diſeaſe. The epiphyſes are generally moſt affected in this ſpecies of the diſorder. For want of early attention to invalids of this sort, we find that their bones not only become ſoft, and yield to the powers of the muſcles, but remain diſtorted the reſt of their lives, though they have acquired a perfect degree of ſolidity. In ſuch caſes, correcting the vitiated juices only will not reſtore the bones to their natural ſtate ; therefore the aſsistance of a ſkilful mechanic is neceſſary both to ſupport the parts improperly acted on, and to alter the line of direction of the diſtorted offeous fibres.</p><p>Though the curvature of the extremities, or thickneſs of the ends of the bones near their articulations, may give the firſt alarm to thoſe who are conſtantly with children, yet there are other ſymptoms that give earlier notice than theſe ; and had they been timely diſcovered by proper judges, it is highly probable that the curvature of the limbs in many children might not have happened. The belly generally becomes larger in this diſeaſe, from the increaſed ſize of the contained bowels, as it is not unlikely but that the meſenteric glands are the firſt parts obſtructed ; obſtructions of the liver, ſpleen, and pancreas, ſoon follow ; the head then becomes enlarged ; then a difficulty of breathing, which is generally ſuppoſed to be the effects of taking cold, ſucceeds ; the ſternum is elevated and ſharp, and the thorax becomes contracted ; the ſpine is protruded in ſeveral parts ; the pelvis altered, according to the preſſure of the parts within, and habitual inclination of the patient, at times, to obtain that line of direction in which the perpendicular from the centre of gravity may fall within the common baſe of the body, the extremities of the cylindrical bones, and the ends of the ribs next the ſternum, become enlarged ; ſoon after this the bones in general become ſoft and flexible, yielding in ſuch directions as the ſtrongeſt muſcles determine by their actions.</p><p>The bones of children who die of this diſorder, we obſerve, are not only rendered ſoft, but the veſſels within their ſubſtance are replete with blood of a texture totally broken, and having more the appearance of thin chocolate than blood : the perioſteum in many places is ſeparated, and the intermediate ſpace between it and the bone filled with extravaſated fluid ; and caries is almoſt as frequent as the ſeparation of the perioſteum. The muſeles in ſuch bodies generally appear pale and flabby.</p><p>Where the affection of the meſenteric glands is evident, Mr Bromefield aſſerts, that after a dose or two oſ the pulvis baſilſeus to empty the inteſtines thoroughly, the purified crude quickſilver is by much the möst efficacious medicine to remove obſtructions in thoſe glands. When the belly begins to ſoften and ſubſide, the chyle passes without interruption, and the child begins to get fleſh ; then the cold bath becomes truly ſerviceable, and the decoction or cold infuſion of the Peruvian bark is a proper reſtorative ; but the cold bath uſed too early, or the bark given before there is a free circulation of chyle through the lacteals, would be very injurious.</p><p>The mollities oſſium, in ſome caſes, may be produced from a redundancy of the oleaginous parts of the blood, or from a laxity of the ſolids, by which the fluids are not ſufficiently attenuated, nor properly blended and mixed : the conſequence of which will be obſtructed perſpiration, the habit in general loaded with groſs, phlegmatic, and ſerous humours, and the oſſific matter not united or condenſed as in an healthy ſtate. The method of cure confirms us in the cauſe of theſe ſymptoms ; for, by ſtrengthening the fibrous ſyſtem, by uſing gentle exerciſe, a dry diet, good air, aromatics, and cold bathing, this kind of invalids are generally reſtored to health.</p><p>Among the diſeaſes of the bones we may likewiſe take notice of that <hi rend="italic">palſy of the lower extremities</hi> which takes place, as is generally ſuppoſed, in conſequence of a curvature in ſome part of the ſpine. To this diſtemper both ſexes and all ages are equally liable. When it attacks an infant of only a year or two old or under, the true cauſe of it is ſel-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0122.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0116"/>
dom diſcovered until ſome time after the effect has taken place. The child is ſaid to be uncommonly backward in the uſe of his legs, or it is thought to have received ſome hurt in the birth. When the child is of an age ſufficient to have already walked, and who has been able to walk, thc loſs of the uſe of his legs is gradual, though in general not very slow. He at firſt complains of being very ſoon tired, is languid, liſtleſs, and unwilling to move much or at all briſkly. Soon after this he may be obſerved frequently to trip and ſtumble, though there be no impediment in his way ; and whenever he attempts to move briſkly, he finds that his legs involuntarily croſs each other, by which he is frequently thrown down without ſtumbling ; and when he endeavours to ſtand ſtill in an erect poſture without support, even for a few minutes, his knees give way and bend forward. As the diſtemper advances, it will be found that he cannot, without much difficulty and deliberation, direct either of his feet exactly to any one point ; and very ſoon after this, both legs and thighs loſe a good deal of their natural ſenſibility, and become quite uſeleſs. In adults, the progreſs of the diſeaſe is much quicker, but the ſymptoms nearly the ſame.</p><p>Until the curvature of the ſpine is diſcovered, the complaint generally paſſes for a nervous one ; but when the ſtate of the back bone is adverted to, recourſe is almoſt always had to ſome previous violence to account for it. That this might have been the caſe in ſome few inſtances might be admitted ; but in by far the greateſt number ſome prediſpoſing cauſe muſt be looked ſor.</p><p>Mr Pott, who has written a treatiſe upon this diſeaſe, recommends it to our obſervation, that though the lower limbs are rendered almoſt uſeleſs, or even entirely ſo, yet there are ſome circumſtances in which it differs from a common nervous palſy. The legs and thighs, though ſo much affected, have neither the flabby feel of a truly paralytic limb ; nor have they that ſeeming looſeneſs at the joints, nor the total incapacity of resiſtance which allows the latter to be twiſted almoſt in all directions : on the contrary, the joints have frequently a conſiderable degree of ſtiffneſs, particularly the ankles ; by which ſtiffneſs the feet of children are generally pointed downward, and they are prevented from ſetting them flat upon the ground.</p><p>At firſt the general health of the patient ſeems not to be at all, or at leaſt not materially affected ; but when the diſeaſe has continued for ſome time, and the curvature is thereby increaſed, many inconveniences and complaints come on ; ſuch as difficulty in reſpiration, indigeſtion, pain, and what they call <hi rend="italic">tightneſs at the stomach,</hi> obſtinate conſtipations, purgings, involuntary flux of urine and feces, &amp;c. with the addition of ſome nervous complaints, which are partly cauſed by the alterations made in the form of the Cavity of the thorax, and partly by impressions made on the abdominal viſcera.</p><p>Mr Pott was led to a knowledge of the true cauſe and cure of this diſtemper, from obſerving the caſe of a youth of 14, who was reſtored to the uſe of his limbs immediately after a ſeemingly accidental abſceſs near the part. From this he was inclined to think, that the curvature of the ſpine was not the original cauſe of the diſorder, but that the ſurrounding parts were prediſpoſed towards it by ſome affection of the ſolids and fluids there ; and he was confirmed in theſe ſuſpicions by a variety of appearances, which he obſerved both in the living body and upon dissection of the ſubject after death ; all of which are narrated at full length in his treatiſe upon this ſubject.</p><p>“ The remedy (ſays he) ſor this moſt dreadful diſeaſe conſiſts merely in procuring a large diſcharge of matter, by ſuppuration, from underneath the membrana adipoſa on each side of the curvature, and in maintaining ſuch diſcharge until the patient ſhall have perfectly recovered the uſe of his legs. To accompliſh this purpoſe, I have made uſe of different means, ſuch as ſetons, iſſues made by inciſion, and isſues made by cauſtic ; and although there be no very material difference, I do upon the whole prefer the laſt. A ſeton is a painful and a naſty thing: beſides which it frequently wears through the ſkin before the end for which it was made can be accompliſhed. Issues made by inciſion, if they be large enough for the intended purpoſe, are apt to become inflamed, and to be very troublelome before they come to ſuppuration ; but openings made by cauſtic are not in general liable to any of theſe inconveniences, at leaſt not so frequently nor in the ſame degree : they are neither ſo troubleſome to make or maintain. I make the eſchars about this ſize and ſhape on each side the curve, taking care to leave a ſufficient portion of ſkin between them. In a few days, when the eſchar begins to looſen and ſeparate, I cut out all the middle, and put into each a large kidney-bean: when the bottoms of the sores are become clean by ſuppuration, I ſprinkle, every third or fourth day, a ſmall quantity of finely powdered cantharides on them, by which the sores are prevented from contracting, the diſcharge increaſed, and poſſibly other benefit obtained. The iſſues I keep open until the cure is complete ; that is, until the patient recovers perfectly the uſe of his legs, or even for ſome time longer: and I ſhould think that it would be more prudent to heal only one of them firſt, keeping the other open for ſome time ; that is, not only until the patient can walk, but until he can walk firmly, briſkly, and without the aſſiſtance of a ſtick : until he can ſtand quite upright, and has recovered all the height which the habit or lather the necessity of ſtooping, occaſioned by the diſtemper, had made him loſe.”</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> VIII. <hi rend="italic">Of Blood-letting.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">Of Blood-letting in general.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Blood-letting</hi> is performed either to lessen the quantity of circulating fluid, or to relieve a particular part : hence we have the terms of <hi rend="italic">general</hi> and <hi rend="italic">local</hi> blood-letting.</p><p><hi rend="italic">General</hi> blood-letting is either performed upon a vein or an artery ; and from this circumſtance ariſe the appellation of <hi rend="italic">phlebotomy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">arteriotomy.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Local</hi> or topical blood-letting is performed by ſcarificators and cupping-glaſſes, by leeches, or by punctures made with a lancet, as may be moſt ſuitable to the nature of the diſeaſe it is intended to remedy.</p><p>There are ſome general rules and obſervations which relate equally to this operation in whatever part of the body it is practiſed : theſe we ſhall in the firſt place enumerate, and ſhall afterwards proceed to treat particularly of bloodletting in the arm and other parts.</p><p>I. In this, as in every other operation, the ſituation of the patient, and of the operator likewiſe, ought to be precisely fixed. The ſituation of a patient, during the operation of blood-letting, has a conſiderable influence on the effects produced, and therefore merits particular attention. In ſome diſorders, it is the object of this remedy to evacuate a conſiderable quantity of blood without inducing fainting : When this is the caſe, and when from former experience it is known that the patient is liable during the evacuation to fall into a faintiſh ſtate, a horizontal poſture ought to be preferred to every other; for fainting is not near ſo ready to occur in a horizontal as in an erect poſture. It now and then happens,<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0123.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0117"/>
however, that one material advantage expected from the operation of blood-letting, is the production of a ſtate of deliquium ; as, for inſtance, in caſes of ſtrangulated hernia, where a general relaxation of the ſyſtem is ſometimes desirable. In all ſuch circumſtances, inſtead of a horizontal poſture, the more erect the patient is kept, the more readily will a ſtate of fainting be induced. The patient ought to be ſo placed, that the principal light of the apartment ſhall fall directly upon the part to be operated upon, that the vein to be opened may be made as apparent as poſſible.</p><p>II. The patient being properly ſeated, the next ſtep is, by means of a proper bandage of ſilk, linen, or woollen cloth, which has more elaſticity, ſo to compreſs the vein intended to be opened, as to prevent the blood from returning to the heart. An equal degree of preſſure ought to be applied to all the other veins of the part : for if this be not attended to, the communication preſerved by the collateral correſponding branches would render the preſſure upon any one particular vein of very little importance. This preſſure upon the veins, by inducing an accumulation of their contents, tends to bring them more evidently into view, and conſequently renders it easier for the operator to effect a proper opening than he would otherwiſe find it. The pressure, however, ought never to be carried ſo far as to obſtruct the circulation in the correſponding arteries, otherwiſe no diſcharge of blood can take place. When we ſee that it has the effect of raiſing the veins, while at the ſame time the pulſation of the artery is diſtinctly felt in that part of the member which lies on the side of the ligature moſt diſtant from the heart, we may be certain that it is to a very proper degree, and that it ought not to be carried farther ; for by the ſwelling or the veins we are ſure that they are sufficiently compressed ; and by the arteries continuing to beat, it is evident that a continued flow of blood may be expected.</p><p>III. The reflux of blood to the heart being in this manner prevented, the next queſtion to be determined is, the beſt method of making an opening into the vein. Different inſtruments have been invented for this purpoſe ; but there are two only which have been retained in uſe, and which are all therefore that here require to be mentioned. Theſe are the lancet and the phlegm. This laſt, on being placed immediately on the part to be cut, is, by means of a ſpring, pushed ſuddenly into the vein, and produces an opening of the exact ſize of the inſtrument employed.</p><p>When it is determined to employ the lancet, which is by far the ſafeſt, the form of that inſtrument is next the object of attention. The broad-shouldered lancet ought to be laid entirely aside ; becauſe the broadneſs of its ſhoulders produces always a wound in the external teguments of perhaps three times the ſize of the opening made in the vein ; a circumſtance which adds no advantage whatever to the operation ; on the contrary, it produces much unneceſſary pain ; renders it frequently a very difficult matter to command a ſtoppage of the blood ; and the wounds produced by it are commonly ſo extenſive as to be liable to terminate in partial ſuppurations.</p><p>The ſpear-pointed lancet, on the contrary, repreſented in Plate CCCCLXXXVII. fig. 8. is in every reſpect well calculated for the purpoſe of veneſection. From the acuteneſſs of its point, it enters the teguments and vein with very little pain ; which is with many patients a circumſtance of no ſmall importance. We are ſure of making the opening in the vein equal, or nearly ſo, to the orifice in the external teguments ; and the diſcharge of blood produced by an opening made with one of theſe lancets, is commonly put a stop to with great eaſe immediately on removing the ligature upon the vein.</p><p>IV. The form of lancet being thus fixed upon, we come now to speak of the method of uſing it. The ſurgeon and patient being both properly ſeated, and the ligature having been applied ſor a ſhort ſpace of time in order to produce ſome degree of ſwelling in the veins, that vein is to be made choice of which, at the ſame time that it appears conſpicuously enough, is found to roll leſs than the others on being preſſed upon by the fingers. It is ſcarcely thought neceſſary to obſerve here, that when a vein appears to be ſo immediately connected with a contiguous artery or tendon, as evidently to produce ſome riſk of wounding theſe parts in the operation, another vein not liable to ſuch hazard, if it can be procured, ought undoubtedly to be preferred. Veins may lie directly above both arteries and tendons, and yet no manner of risk be incurred by opening them, provided the operator is ſufficiently ſteady and attentive ; but it does now and then happen, that veins are ſo nearly and intimately connected with theſe parts, as to render it hazardous even for the moſt dexterous ſurgeon to attempt this operation.</p><p>The vein being at laſt made choice of, the ſurgeon, if he is to uſe his right-hand in the operation, takes a firm hold of the member from whence the blood is to be drawn with his left, and with the thumb of the ſame hand he is now to make ſuch a degree of preſſure upon the vein, about an inch and a half below the part where the orifice is to be made, as not only to render the ſkin and teguments ſomewhat tenſe; but at the same time to interrupt for a little all communication between the under part of the vein and that portion of it lying between the ligature and the thumb placed as thus directed.</p><p>The lancet being drawn out ſo as to form nearly a right angle with the ſcales, the operator now takes it between the finger and thumb oſ his right-hand ; and leaving at leaſt one half of the blade uncovered, he reſts his hand on the middle-finger, ring-finger, and little-finger, all placed as conveniently as poſſible in the neighbourhood of the vein from whence the blood is to be taken ; and having puſhed the point of the inſtrument freely through the ſkin and teguments into the vein, he now carries it forward in an oblique direction, till the orifice is of the ſize he inclines to have it; taking care, during the time of puſhing on the lancet, that its point be kept in as ſtraight a direction as poſſible, for fear of dipping into the parts below.</p><p>The inſtrument is now to be withdrawn ; and the ſurgeon, removing the thumb of his left hand, is to allow the vein to empty itſelf freely into the different cups previouſly provided for the purpoſe.</p><p>It is of importance to obſerve, that during the time the blood is diſcharging, the member ought to be kept in exactly the ſame poſture it was in when the lancet was firſt introduced : otherwiſe the orifice in the ſkin is apt to slip over the opening in the vein ; a circumſtance which always proves inconvenient, and on ſome occaſions produces a good deal of trouble by the blood from the vein inſinuating itſelf into the ſurrounding cellular ſubſtance.</p><p>V. When the vein is properly cut, and the orifice is made ſufficiently large, it rarely occurs that any difficulty is experienced in procuring all the blood that is wanted. But when this laſt circumſtance occurs, from the patient becoming faintiſh, a ſtream of freſh air ought to be admitted to the apartment, wine or ſome other cordial ſhould be adminiſtered, and the patient ought to be laid in a horizontal poſture. By theſe means the faintiſhneſs will in general be ſoon removed : but if ſtill the blood ſhould not flow freely, the member ought to be put into all the variety of poſitions that can probably aſſiſt in bringing the openings of the ſkin and other teguments to correſpond with that of the vein ; which will ſoon be known to have happened by the<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0124.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0118"/>
blood beginning inſtantly to flow. Throwing the muscles of the part into constant action, by giving the patient a cane or any other firm ſubſtance to turn frequently round in his hand when the operation is done in the arm, will often anſwer in producing a conſtant flow of blood from a vein when every other means has failed : And, laſtly, when the pulſe in the inferior part of the member is felt very feeble, or eſpecially if it cannot be diſtinguiſhed at all, we may be thereby rendered certain that the ligature is too tight, and may in general have it in our power to produce an immediate flow of blood, by removing the compreſſion thus improperly made upon the arteries of the part.</p><p>VI. A quantity of blood proportioned to the nature of the disorder being thus diſcharged, the pressure upon the ſuperior part of the vein ſhould be immediately removed ; and this being done, if the spear-pointed lancet has been uſed, all farther loſs of blood will in general stop immediately. The contrary of this, however, ſometimes occurs, and blood continues to flow freely even after the ligature is removed. When this is the caſe, the operator ought to compreſs the vein both above and below the orifice, by means or the finger and thumb of one hand, ſo as to prevent any farther loss of blood. This being done, and the orifice being cleared of every particle of blood, the ſides of it ſhould be laid as exactly together as poſſible ; and a piece of court or any other adheſive plaſter being ſo applied as to retain them, it will ſeldom happen that any kind of bandage is neceſſary : but when the blood has iſſued with uncommon violence during the operation, and has been difficult to command after the removal of the ligature, in ſuch inſtances it will be prudent to apply a ſmall compreſs of linen over the plaſter, and to ſecure the whole with a linen roller properly applied round the member.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Of Veneſection in different Parts of the Body.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">When</hi> veneſection is to be performed in the arm, the ligature for stopping the circulation ought to be placed about an inch or an inch and a half above the joint of the elbow, and brought twice round : in order to prevent the ends of it from interfering with the lancet, the knot ſhould be made on the outſide of the arm. In general, one knot might anſwer ; but a slip-knot being made above the first, renders it more ſecure, and it is very easily done.</p><p>In forming the choice of a vein ſrom whence blood is to be taken, the general rules we have already laid down upon this point muſt be here particularly attended to. In general the artery lies ſo low in this place, that the median baſilic vein, under which it commonly runs, may be opened with perfect ſafety ; and as this vein in general appears more conspicuous than any of the others, probably from the continued pulſation of the artery below obſtructing in ſome meaſure the paſſage of its contents, it is in this reſpect therefore more properly calculated for this operation than any of the others. Other circumſtances occur too which render the median baſilic preferable to the cephalic or median cephalic veins for the operation of blood-letting. The former, viz. the median baſilic, is leſs deeply covered with cellular ſubſtance ; and by lying towards the inner part of the arm, it is more thinly covered with the tendinous expanſion of the biceps muſcle than either of the others. From theſe circumſtances, the operation is always attended with leſs pain when done in this vein than in any of the others.</p><p>In very corpulent people, it ſometimes happens that all the larger veins lie ſo deep as not to be diſcovered by the eye ; but when they are lenſibly felt by the fingers, even although they cannot be ſeen, they may be always opened with freedom. In a few inſtances, however, they can neither be diſtinguiſhed by the eye nor by the finger ; in ſuch a situation, as they may in general be met with about the wriſt or on the back-part of the hand, the ligature ſhould be removed from the upper part of the arm ; and being applied about half way between the elbow and wriſt, the veins below will thereby be brought into view; and wherever a vein can be evidently obſerved, there can be no danger in having recourſe to the operation.</p><p>There is only one vein of the neck, viz. the poſterior external jugular, which can eaſily be brought ſo much into view as to be with propriety opened ; and even this lies deeply covered with parts, not only with the ſkin and cellular ſubſtance, but with the fibres of the platiſma myoides muſcle ; ſo that a conſiderable degree of preſſure becomes neceſſary in order to raiſe it to any height. With a view to produce this, the operator’s thumb is commonly adviſed to be placed upon the vein, ſo as to compreſs ineffectually about an inch or an inch and a half below where the opening is to be made. This, however, ſeldom proves ſufficient for the purpoſe, as the blood, on being stopped in its progreſs through this branch, eaſily finds a paſſage to the other veins ; ſo that unleſs the principal vein on the other side of the neck is alſo compressed, the vein to be opened can never be fully diſtended. In cider to effect this, a firm compreſs of linen ſhould be applied on the largeſt vein on the oppoſite ſide of the neck ; and an ordinary garter, or any other proper ligature, being laid directly over it, ſhould be tied with a firm knot below the oppoſite arm-pit ; taking care to make ſuch a degree of preſſure, as to put an entire stop to the circulation in the vein, which in this way may be eaſily effected without producing any obſtruction to the patient’s breathing. But to prevent every inconvenience of this kind, ſee an inſtrument contrived for the purpoſe, Plate CCCCLXXXVII. fig. 9.</p><p>This being done, and the patient’s head properly ſupported, the operator, with the thumb of his left hand, is now to make a ſufficient preſſure upon the vein to be opened ; and with the lancet in his right hand is to penetrate at once into the vein ; and before withdrawing the inſtrument, an orifice ſhould be made large enough for the intended evacuation. It may be proper to obſerve, that a more extenſive opening ought always to be made here than is neceſſary in the arm, otherwiſe the quantity of blood is generally procured with difficulty: and beſides, there is not the same neceſſity for caution on this point here that there is in the arm ; for it ſeldom or never happens that any difficulty occurs in this ſituation, in putting a stop to the blood after the preſſure is removed from the veins ; all that is commonly neceſſary for this purpoſe being a slip of adheſive plaster without any bandage whatever.</p><p>In order to bring the vein more clearly into view, ſo as afterwards to be able to open it with more exactneſs, it has been recommended, that the ſkin, cellular ſubſtance, and muſcular fibres covering the vein, ſhould be previouſly divided with a ſcalpel before attempting to puſh the lancet into it. There is not, however, any neceſſity for this precaution, as it rarely happens that any difficulty is experienced in procuring a free diſcharge of blood by opening the vein and teguments at once in the manner directed. And it is here, as in every inſtance where it is neceſſary to take blood by a lancet, if it is not done at once, the patient is much disappointed, and is ſure to attribute the failure entirely to a fault in the operator.</p><p>When blood is to be diſcharged from the veins of the ankle or feet, the ligature being applied a little above the ankle-joint, all the branches of the vena ſaphena, both in the inſide and outſide of the foot, come at once into view ; and as this vein lies everywhere very ſuperficial, being in general covered with skin only, wherever a pro<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0125.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0119"/>
per vein appears conſpicuouſly it may with ſafety be opened.</p><p>With a view to encourage the diſcharge of blood, it has been a conſtant practice in blood-letting, in theſe veins, to dip the feet into warm water immediately on the orifice being made. But this is a very inaccurate method of proceeding, as the quantity of blood taken in this manner can never be ascertained with preciſion ; for the blood being all mixed with the water, the operator can never be in any degree certain as to this point : and beſides, there does not appear to be any neceſſity for this aſſiſtance ; for when the compreſſion of the ſuperior part of the veins is made effectual, and the orifice is of a proper ſize, there is ſeldom more difficulty in obtaining a full diſcharge of blood from the veins of theſe parts than from any other veins of the body.</p><p>On removing the ligature, the diſcharge is generally stopped at once ; ſo that a piece of adheſive plaſter applied over the orifice anſwers all the purpoſe of a bandage. The arm, neck, and ankles are the parts from whence blood is uſually taken by veneſection ; but on ſome occaſions, where the contiguous parts have been particularly affected, it has been thought adviſable to perform veneſection in other places.</p><p>When veneſection is to be performed in the veins called <hi rend="italic">ranula</hi> under the tongue, the apex of the tongue is to be elevated, and the vein on each side opened, becauſe the opening of one only will hardly ever diſcharge blood enough. After a ſufficient quantity has been diſcharged, ſome cold aſtringent fluid taken into the mouth will generally stop the hemorrhagy.</p><p>The vena dorſalis penis, which runs along the back or upper side of this member, being generally pretty much diſtended, and conſpicuous in an inflammation of this part, may be opened about the middle or back part of the penis ; and a ſufficient quantity of blood be diſcharged proportionable to the urgency of the ſymptoms. This being done, apply a compreſs and bandage proper for the penis. The arteries and nerves which lie on each side of the vein are to be avoided : nor ought the bandage to be too tight, otherwiſe the inflammation and other ſymptoms may turn out worſe than before.</p><p>When it is found neceſſary to diſcharge blood in this manner from the penis, the veins can be eaſily brought into view, by producing an accumulation of their contents in the ſame manner as in other parts of the body, through the intervention of a ligature : but in the tongue, in the haemorrhoidal veins about the anus, and other parts where compreſſion cannot be applied, all that the ſurgeon can do, is to make an orifice of a proper ſize in that part of the vein which ſhows itſelf moſt evidently ; and if a ſufficient diſcharge of blood is not thus produced, as there is no other method of effecting it, immerſing the parts in warm water may in ſuch circumſtances be a very neceſſary meaſure.</p><p>There are ſeveral waysof performing the operation of bloodletting in the eyes. We ſhall here only relate the chief : Firſt, the patient is to be ſeated conveniently on the bed-side or on a chair, with his head held in a proper poſture by an aſſiſtant ; which done, the ſurgeon makes a tranſverſe inciſion with a lancet upon the turgid ſmall veſſels in the corners of the eye, ſo as to open them or cut them quite acroſs. Some uſe a ſmall pair of ſciſſars, inſtead of a lancet, to divide the veſſels ; but in uſing either of them, the eye-lids muſt be separated from each other by the fingers of one hand, while the veſſels are cut by inſtruments held in the other. Some, again, elevate the ſmall turgid veſſels with a crooked needle before they divide them, the eye-lids being in the mean time held aſunder by an aſſiſtant. The ſmall veſſels being thus opened or divided, their diſcharge of blood ſhould be promoted by fomentations of warm water frequently applied to the eye by means of a ſponge or ſoft linen rags.</p><p>Among other methods that have been propoſed ſor ſcarifying the blood-veſſels of the eye, the beards of rough barley were at one period much extolled, and are ſtill employed by ſome individuals. By drawing them over thc ſurface of the eye, in a direction contrary to the ſharp ſpiculæ with which they are furniſhed, a conſiderable diſcharge of blood is thereby produced : But the pain attending this operation is exquiſite ; and as it does not poſſeſs any ſuperior advantage to the method with the lancet, it is now falling into general diſuſe.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Of Arteriotomy.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Whatever</hi> particular advantages may in theory have been expected from arteriotomy, and however ſome of its ſupporters may have recommended it, not only as being in many inſtances preferable to veneſection, but as an operation perfectly ſafe even in veſſels of conſiderable ſize ; yet the moſt ſtrenuous friends to the practice have ſhrunk from any real attempt of this kind on the larger arteries. Inſtances have no doubt occurred of large arteries having been opened without any danger enſuing ; but theſe are ſo exceedingly rare, that no practitioner of experience will, from that conſideration, be induced coolly to proceed to open any artery of importance. The ſmaller branches of arteries may indeed be opened with great ſafety, when they are not deeply covered, and eſpecially when they lie contiguous to bones ; but in any of the larger arteries, the attempt muſt be always attended with ſo much hazard, and the advantages to be expected from it, in preference to veneſection, are appearently ſo trifling, as muſt in all probability prevent it from ever being carried into execution.</p><p>There are very few arteries, therefore, which, with any propriety, can be opened : the different branches of the temporal are the only arteries indeed from whence blood, in ordinary practice, is ever taken ; for although the opening of ſome other branches of arteries has by ſome been proposed, yet they are ſituated in ſuch a manner that they either cannot be readily come at, or being in the neighbourhood of ſo large nerves, the opening of them might be attended with bad conſequences. In performing this operation on any of the temporal branches, if the artery lies ſuperficial, it may be done with one puſh of the lancet, in the ſame manner as was directed for veneſection ; but when the artery lies deeply covered with cellular subſtance, it is always neceſſary to lay it fairly open to view, before making the orifice with the lancet : for in all the smaller arteries, when they are cut entirely acroſs, there is little chance of being able to procure any conſiderable quantity of blood from them ; as, when divided in this manner, they are ſure to retract conſiderably within the ſurrounding parts, which commonly puts a stop to all farther evacuation.</p><p>some degree of nicety is alſo neceſſary in making the opening into the artery of a proper oblique direction, neither quite acroſs nor directly longitudinal ; for a longitudinal opening never bleeds ſo freely, either in an artery or in a vein, as when its direction is somewhat oblique.</p><p>If the opening has been properly made, and if the artery is of any tolerable ſize, it will at once diſcharge very freely without any compreſſion ; but when the evacuation does not go on ſo well as could be wiſhed, the diſcharge may be always aſſiſted by compreſſing the artery immediately above the orifice, between it and the correſponding veins. The quantity of blood being thus diſeharged, it will commonly happen, that a very slight compreſſion on theſe ſmaller arteries will ſuffice for putting a stop to the evacuation : and<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0126.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0120"/>
whatever preſſure is found necessary, may be here applied in the ſame manner as was directed in veneſection.</p><p>It happens, however, in ſome inſtances, that this does not ſucceed, the orifice continuing to burſt out ſrom time to time, ſo as to be productive of much diſtreſs and inconvenience.</p><p>In this ſituation there are three different methods by which we may with tolerable certainty put a ſtop to the farther diſcharge of blood. 1st, If the artery is ſmall, as all thc branches of the temporal arteries commonly are, the cutting it entirely across, exactly at the orifice made with the lancet, by allowing it to retract within the ſurrounding parts, generally puts an immediate ſtop to the diſcharge. 2d, When that is not conſented to, we have it always in our power to ſecure the bleeding veſſel with a ligature, as we would do an artery accidentally divided in any part of the body. And, laſtly, if neither of theſe methods is agreed to by the patient, we can, by means oſ a constant regular preſſure, obliterate the cavity of the artery at the place where the operation has been performed, by producing the accretien of its ſides. Different bandages have been contrived for compreſſing the temporal artery ; but none of them anſwer the purpoſe ſo eaſily and ſo effectually as the one figured in Plate CCCCLXXXVII. fig. 10. This method is more tedious ; but to timid patients it generally proves more acceptable than either of the other two.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV. <hi rend="italic">Of Topical Blooding.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">When,</hi> either ſrom the ſeverity of a local fixed pain, or from any other cauſe, it is wiſhed to evacuate blood directly from the ſmall veſſels of the part affected, inſtead of opening any of the larger arteries or veins, the following are the different modes proposed for effecting it, viz. by means of leeches ; by slight ſcarifications with the ſhoulder or edge of a lancet ; and, laſtly, by means of an inſtrument termed a <hi rend="italic">ſcarificator,</hi> (Plate CCCCLXXXVII. fig. 11.) ; in which ſixteen or twenty lancets are commonly placed, in ſuch a manner, that, when the inſtrument is applied to the part affected, the whole number of lancets contained in it are, by means of a ſtrong ſpring, pushed ſuddenly into it, to the depth at which the inſtrument has been previouſly regulated. This being done, as the ſmaller blood-veſſels only by this operation are ever intended to be cut, and as theſe do not commonly diſcharge freely, ſome means or other become neceſſary for promoting the evacuation.</p><p>Various methods have been propoſed for this purpoſe. Glaſſes fitted to the form of the affected parts, with a ſmall hole in the bottom of each, were long ago contrived : and theſe being placed upon the ſcarified parts, a degree of ſuction was produced by a perſon’s mouth ſufficient for nearly exhausting the air contained in the glaſs : and this accordingly was a ſure enough method of increaſing the evacuation of blood to a certain extent. But as this was attended with a good deal of trouble, and beſides did not on every occaſion prove altogether effectual, an exhauſting ſyringe was at laſt adapted to the glaſs : which did indeed anſwer as a very certain method of extracting the air contained in it ; but the application of this inſtrument for any length of time is very troubleſome, and it is difficult to preſerve the ſyringe always air-tight.</p><p>The application of heat to the <hi rend="italic">cupping-glaſſes,</hi> repreſented in Plate CCCCLXXXVII. fig. 12. has been found to rarefy the air contained in them to a degree ſufficient for producing a very conſiderable ſuction. And as the inſtrument in this ſimple form anſwers the purpoſe in view with very little trouble to the operator, and as it is at all times eaſily obtained, the uſe of the ſyringe has therefore been laid aſide.</p><p>There are different methods adopted ſor thus applying heat to the cavity of the glaſs. By ſupporting the mouth of it for a few ſeconds above the flame of a taper, the air may be ſufficiently rarefied ; but if the flame is not kept exactly in the middle, but is allowed to touch either the sides or bottom of the glaſs, it is very apt to make it crack. A more certain, as well as an eaſier, method of applying the heat, is to dip a piece of ſoft bibulous paper in ſpirit of wine ; and having ſet it on fire, to put it into the bottom of the glaſs, and, on its being nearly extinguiſhed, to apply the mouth of the inſtrument directly upon the ſcarified part. This degree of heat, which may be always regulated by the ſize of the piece of paper, and which it is evident ought to be always in proportion to the ſize of the glaſs, if long enough applied, proves always ſufficient for rarefying the air very effectually, and at the ſame time, if done with any manner of caution, never injures the glaſs in the leaſt.</p><p>The glaſs having been thus applied, if the ſcarifications have been properly made, they inſtantly begin to diſcharge freely : and ſo ſoon as the inſtrument is nearly full of blood, it ſhould be taken away ; which may be always eaſily done by raiſing one side of it, ſo as to give acceſs to the external air. When more blood is wiſhed to be taken, the parts ſhould be bathed with warm water; and being made perfectly dry, another glaſs, exactly the ſize of the former, ſhould be inſtantly applied in the very ſame manner : and thus, if the ſcarificator has been made to puſh to a ſufficient depth, so as to have cut all the cutaneous veſſels of the part, almoſt any neceſſary quantity of blood may be obtained. It ſometimes happens, however, that the full quantity intended to be discharged cannot be got at one place. In ſuch a caſe, the ſcarificator muſt be again applied on a part as contiguous to the other as poſſible ; and this being done, the application of the glaſſes muſt alſo be renewed as before.</p><p>When it is wiſhed to diſcharge the quantity oſ blood as quickly as poſſible, two or more glaſſes may be applied at once on contiguous parts previouſly ſcarified ; and, on ſome occaſions, the quantity of blood is more quickly obtained by the cupping-glaſſes being applied for a few ſeconds upon the parts to be afterwards ſcarified. The ſuction produced by the glaſſes may poſſibly have ſome influence in bringing the more deep-ſeated veſſels into nearer contact with the skin, ſo that more of them will be cut by the ſcarificator.</p><p>A ſufficient quantity of blood being procured, the wounds made by the different lancets ſhould be all perfectly cleared of blood ; and a bit of ſoft linen or charpie, dipped in a little milk or cream, applied over the whoſe, is the only dreſſing that is neceſſary. When dry linen is applied, it not only creates more uneaſiness to the patient, but renders the wounds more apt to fester than when it has been previouſly wetted in the manner directed.</p><p>Dry cupping conſiſts in the application of the cupping- glaſſes directly to the parts affected, without the uſe of the ſcarificator. By this means a tumor is produced upon the part ; and where any advantage is to be expected from a determination of blood to a particular ſpot, it may probably be more eaſily accompliſhed by this means than by any other.</p><p>When the part from which it is intended to produce a local evacuation of this kind is ſo ſituated, that a ſcarificator and cupping-glaſſes can be applied, this method is greatly preferable to every other ; but in inflammatory affections of the eye, of the noſe, and of other parts of the face, &amp;c. the ſcarificator cannot be properly applied directly to the parts affected. In ſuch inſtances, leeches are commonly<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0127.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0121"/>
had recourſe to, as they can be placed upon almoſt any ſpot from whence we would wiſh to diſcharge blood.</p><p>In the application of theſe animals, the moſt effectual method of making them fix upon a particular ſpot, is to confine them to the part by means of a ſmall wine-glaſs. Allowing them to creep upon a dry cloth, or upon a dry board, for a few minutes before application, makes them fix more readily ; and moiſtening and cooling the parts on which they are intended to fix, either with milk, cream, or blood, tends also to cauſe them adhere much more ſpeedily than they otherwiſe would do. So ſoon as the leeches have ſeparated, the ordinary method of promoting the diſcharge of blood, is to cover the parts with linen cloths wet in warm water. In ſome ſituations, this may probably be as effectual a method as any other ; but wherever the cupping-glaſſes can be applied over the wounds, they anſwer the purpoſe much more effectually.</p><p>The ſeton is uſed where a large quantity oſ matter is wanted, and eſpecially where it is wiſhed for from deep ſeated parts. It is frequently uſed in the back of the neck, for diſeaſes of the head or eyes, or between two of the ribs in affections of the breaſt.</p><p>When the cord, which is to be made of threads of cotton or ſilk, is to be introduced, the parts at which it is to enter and pals out ſhould be previouſly marked with ink, and a ſmall part of the cord being beſmeared with ſome mild ointment, and paſſed through the eye of the ſeton-needle, Plate CCCCLXXXVII. fig. 13. the part is to be ſupported by an aſſiſtant, and the needle paſſed fairly through, leaving a few inches of the cord hanging out. The needle is now to be removed and the part dressed. By this method matter is produced in quantity proportioned to the degree of irritation applied ; and this can be increaſed or diminiſhed by covering the cord daily before it is drawn with an irritating or mild ointment.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Chap.</hi> <hi rend="italic">IX.</hi> Of Iſſues.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Issues</hi> are a kind of artificial ulcers formed in different parts of the body with a view to procure a diſcharge of purulent matter, which is frequently of advantage in different diſorders.</p><p>Practitioners were formerly of opinion that iſſues ſerved as drains to carry off the noxious humours from the blood, and therefore they placed them as near the affected part as poſſible. But as it is now known that they prove uſeful merely by the quantity of matter which they afford, they are generally placed where they will occaſion the leaſt inconvenience. The moſt proper parts for them are, the nape of the meek ; the middle, outer, and fore part of the humerus ; the hollow above the inner side of the knee ; or either side of the ſpine of the back ; or between two of the ribs ; or wherever there is a ſufficiency of cellular ſubſtance for the protection of the parts beneath : they ought never to be placed over the belly of a muſcle ; nor over a tendon, or thinly covered bone ; nor near any large blood-vessel.</p><p>The iſſues commonly uſed are, the bliſter-iſſue, the pea- issue, and the ſeton or cord.</p><p>Whem a bliſter-issue is to be uſed, after the bliſter is removed, a diſcharge of matter may be kept up by dreſſing the part daily with an ointment mixed with the powder of cantharides. If the diſcharge be too little, more of the powder may be uſed ; if too great, or if the part be much inflamed, the iſſue ointment may be laid aſide, and the part dreſſed with baſilicon, or with Turner’s cerate, till the diſcharge be diminiſhed and the inflammation abated. It is moſt proper ſometimes to uſe the iſſue ointment and a mild one alternately.</p><p>A pea-iſſue is formed either by making an inciſion with a lancet, or by cauſtic, large enough to admit one or more peas ; though ſometimes inſtead of peas, kidney-beans, Gentian root, or orange-peas, are uſed. When the opening is made by an inciſion, the ſkin ſhould be pinched up and cut through, of a ſize ſufficient to receive the ſubſtance to be put into it. But when it is to be done by cauſtic, the common cauſtic or lapis inſernalis of the ſhops anſwers beſt : it ought to be reduced to a paſte with a little water or ſoft ſoap, to prevent it from ſpreading ; and adheſive plaſter, with a ſmall hole cut in the centre of it, ſhould be previouſly placed, and the cauſtic paſte ſpread upon the hole in the centre. Over the whole an adheſive plaſter ſhould be placed to prevent any cauſtic from eſcaping. In ten or twelve hours, the whole may be removed, and in three or four days the eſchar will ſeparate, when the opening may be filled with peas, or any of the other ſubſtances already mentioned.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> X. <hi rend="italic">Of Sutures and Ligatures of Arteries.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">Of Sutures.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> intention of sutures is to unite parts which have been divided, and where the retraction of the lips of the wound has been conſiderable. The futures in ordinary uſe at preſent, among ſurgeons, are the interrupted, the quilled, and the twiſted. Beſides theſe futures, adheſive plaſters are uſed for uniting the lips of wounds, which have been termed the <hi rend="italic">false</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dry</hi> future, in oppoſition to the others which have obtained the name of <hi rend="italic">true</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bloody.</hi> The true future is uſed in caſes of deep wounds, while the falſe is employed in thoſe of a superficial nature.</p><p>The interrupted future is made as follows. The wound being emptied of the grumous blood, and the aſſiſtant taking care that the lips of it lie quite even, the ſurgeon is carefully to carry the needles from the bottom outwards ; uſing the caution of making them come out far enough from the edge of the wound, which will not only facilitate the paſſing the ligature, but will alſo prevent it from cutting through the ſkin and fleſh ; as many more ſtitches as may be required will be only repetitions of the ſame proceſs. The threads being all paſſed, let thoſe be firſt tied which are in the middle of the wound : though, if the lips are held carefully together all the while, as they ſhould be, it will be of no great conſequence which is done firſt. The moſt uſeful kind of knot is a ſingle one firſt, and then a slip-knot, which may be looſened upon any conſiderable inflammation taking place. If a violent inflammation ſhould ſucceed, looſening the ligature only will not ſuffice ; it muſt be cut through and drawn away, and the wound be treated afterwards without any future. When the wound is ſmall, the leſs it is diſturbed by dreſſing the better ; but in large ones, there will ſometimes be a conſiderable diſcharge ; and if the threads be not cautiouſly carried through the bottom of it, abſcesses will frequently enſue from the matter being pent up underneath, and not finding iſſue. If no accident happen, after the lips are firmly agglutinated, the ligatures are to be removed, and the orifices which they leave dreſſed.</p><p>It will readily be underſtood, that the ſtrength of the ligature and ſize oſ the needle ought always to be proportionable to the depth of the ſore and retraction of the parts. The proper form of needſes is repreſented in Pl. CCCCLXXXVII. fig. 14.</p><p>It muſt likewiſe be remembered, that during the cure the future muſt be always aſſiſted by the application of bandage, if poſſible, which is frequently of the greateſt importance ; and that sort of bandage with two heads, and a ſlit in the<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0128.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0122"/>
middle, which is by much the beſt, will in moſt caſes be found practicable.</p><p>In deep wounds, attended with much retraction, it is always a neceſſary precaution, to aſſiſt the operation of the ligatures by means of bandages, ſo applied as to afford as much ſupport as poſſible to the divided parts : But even with every aſſiſtance of this nature, it now and then happens, that the divided parts cannot be kept together, retraction occurs to a greater or lesser degree, and the ligatures of courſe cut aſunder the ſoft parts they were at firſt made to surround.</p><p>With a view to prevent this receding of the teguments and other parts, it was long ago propoſed to add to the interrupted suture what was ſuppoſed would afford an additional ſupport, viz. quills, or pieces of plaſter rolled up into the form of quills ; one of which being placed on each ſide of the wound, the double of the ligature is made to include the one, and the knot to preſs directly upon the other, inſtead of being made immediately on the edges of the ſore, as was directed for interrupted sutures.</p><p>It is at once evident, however, that the ligatures muſt here make the ſame degree of preſſure on the parts through which they paſs as they co in the interrupted suture ; and this being the caſe, it is equally obvious, that the interpoſition of theſe ſubſtances cannot be of any uſe. This suture is accordingly now very rarely practiſed, and it is probable that it will be ſoon laid entirely aside.</p><p>By the term tw <hi rend="italic">isted suture,</hi> is meant that ſpecies of ligature by which parts, either naturally or artificially ſeparated, are united together, by means of ſtrong threads properly twiſted round pins or needles puſhed through the edges of the divided parts.</p><p>This suture is commonly employed for the purpoſe of uniting the parts in caſes of hare-lip ; and this indeed is almost the only uſe to which it has been hitherto applied : But it may with great advantage be put in practice in a variety of other caſes, particularly in all artificial or accidental diviſions either of the lips or cheeks ; and in every wound in other parts that does not run deep, and in which sutures are necessary, this suture is preferable to the interrupted or any other, The pins made uſe of for twiſting the threads upon ought to be made of a flat form, ſo as not to cut the parts through which they paſs ſo readily as the ligatures employed in the interrupted suture. And thus one great objection to the latter is very effectually obviated : for every practitioner muſt be ſenſible of this being the moſt faulty part of the interrupted suture, that when muſcular parts are divided ſo as to produce much retraction, the ligatures employed for retaining them almoſt conſtantly cut them through before a reunion is accompliſhed ; whereas the flatneſs of the pins uſed in the twiſted suture, and upon which the whole preſſure produced by the ligatuers is made to reſt, proves in general a very effectual preventative againſt all ſuch occurrences.</p><p>The pins uſed in this operation are repreſented in Plate CCCCLXXXVII. fig. 15. They are commonly made of gold or silver ; and in order to make them paſs with greater eaſe, ſteel points are added to them. They are ſometimes uſed, however, of gold or ſilver alone.</p><p>The manner of performing this operation is as follows. The divided parts intended to be reunited, muſt, by the hands of an aſſiſtant, be brought nearly into contact ; leaving juſt as much ſpace between the edges of the ſore as to allow the ſurgeon to ſee that the pins are carried to a proper depth. This being done, one of the pins muſt be introduced through both ſides of the wound, by entering it on one ſide externally, puſhing it forwards and inwards to within a little of the bottom of the wound, and afterwards carrying it outwardly through the oppoſite side, to the ſame diſtance from the edge of the ſore that it was made to enter at on the other.</p><p>The diſtance at which the needle ought to enter from the edge of the ſore muſt be determined by the depth of the wound, and by the degree of retraction produced in the divided parts. In general, however, it is a proper regulation, in deep wounds, to carry the pins nearly to the same diſtance from the ſide of the ſore as they are made to penetrate in depth : And whatever the deepneſs of the wound may be, the pins ought to paſs within a very little of its bottom : otherwiſe the parts which lie deep will run a risk of not being united ; a circumſtance which muſt always give rise to troubleſome collections of matter.</p><p>The firſt pin being paſſed in this manner very near to one end of the ſore, and the parts being ſtill ſupported by an aſſiſtant, the ſurgeon, by means oſ a firm waxed ligature, paſſed three or four times round and acroſs the pin, ſo as nearly to deſcribe the figure of 8, is to draw the parts through which it has paſſed into immediate and cloſe contact : and the thread being now ſecured with a looſe knot, another pin muſt be introduced in the ſame manner at a proper diſtance from the former ; and the thread with which the other was fixed being looſed, and in the ſame manner carried round this pin, others muſt be introduced at proper diſtances along the whole courſe of the wound ; and the ſame ligature ought to be of a ſufficient length for ſecuring the whole.</p><p>The number of pins to be uſed muſt be determined entirely by the extent of the wound. Whenever this suture is practiſed, a pin ought to be introduced very near each end of the wound, otherwiſe the extremities of the ſore are apt to ſeparate ſo as not to be afterwards eaſily reunited. In large wounds, if the pins are introduced at the diſtance of three quarters of an inch from one another, it will in general be found ſufficient; but in cuts of ſmaller extent a greater number of pins become neceſſary in proportion to the dimenſions of the sores.</p><p>Thus in a wound of an inch and half in length, three pins are abſolutely requiſite ; one near to each end, and another in the middle oſ the ſore : whereas five pins will always be found fully ſufficient for a wound of three inches and a half in extent, allowing one to be within a quarter of an inch of each extremity of the wound, and the others’ to be placed along the courſe of the ſore at the diſtance of three quarters of an inch from one another.</p><p>The pins being all introduced and ſecured in the manner directed, nothing remains to be done, but to apply a piece of lint wet with mucilage all along the courſe of the wound, with a view to exclude, as effectually as poſſible, every acceſs to the external air.</p><p>When the pins remain long, they generally do harm, by the unneceſſary irritation and conſequent retraction of parts with which they are always-attended; and if they are not continued for a ſufficient length of time, that degree of adheſion is not produced between the divided parts which is neceſſary for their future retention ; ſo that the effect of the operation comes to be in a great meaſure, if not entirely, loſt.</p><p>In wounds of no great depth, for inſtance of three quarters of an inch or ſo, a ſufficient degree of adheſion always takes place in the ſpace of five days ; and six, or at moſt ſeven days, will generally be found ſufficient for wounds of the greateſt depth. But with reſpect to this circumſtance, it muſt always be underſtood, that the patient’s ſtate of health muſt have a conſiderable influence on the time neceſſary for producing adheſion between divided parts.</p><p>When the pins are withdrawn, the uniting bandage may<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0129.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0123"/>
be applied with great advantage ; but as slips of leather ſpread with ordinary glue, when applied to each ſide of the cicatrix, may, by means of ligatures properly connected with them, be made to anſwer the purpoſe more effectually, this mode of ſupporting the parts ought of courſe to be preferred.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Of the Ligature of Arteries.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">When</hi> a ſurgeon is called immediately to a wound of any great artery of a limb, he ſhould clap the point of his finger upon the wounded artery, or make his aſſiſtant hold it ; cut the wound ſo far open as to ſee the artery fairly ; draw it out if it be cut acroſs, and have ſhrunk among the fleſh ; or tie it like the artery of the arm in aneuriſm by passing ligatures under it. When, however, the wound happens in ſuch situations that we cannot command the blood, it is better to cloſe the lips of the wound, and try to make them adhere by means of a very ſteady compreſs and bandage. Thus an aneuriſm will form ; the operation for the cure of which ſhall be afterwards deſcribed.</p><p>When accidents of this nature occur in any of the extremities, and where preſſure can be made with eaſe on the ſuperior part of the artery, we are poſſessed of an inſtrument which never fails to put a ſtop to all further loſs of blood: we mean the tourniquet. SeePlateCCCCLXXXVII. fig 16.</p><p>The tourniquet has undergone many improvements ; but the one here repreſented is conſidered as the beſt. By means of it the blood in any limb is very eaſily and effectually commanded ; and as it graſps the whole member equally, all the collateral branches, as well as the principal arteries, are equally compreſſed by it. It has this material advantage too ever every other inſtrument of this kind, that, when properly applied, a single turn, or even half a turn, of the ſcrew, is ſufficient for producing either a flow of blood, or for putting a total ſtop to it. The manner of uſing it is as follows.</p><p>Let a cuſhion of three inches in length by one inch and half in diameter be prepared of a linen roller, tolerably firm, but not ſo hard as to render preſſure produced by it very painful. This being placed upon the courſe of the principal artery of the limb, is to be firmly ſecured in that ſituation by one or two turns of a circular roller, of the ſame breadth with the cuſhion itſelf.</p><p>The inſtrument, with the ſtrap connected with it, being now placed upon the limb, with the handle of the ſcrew on the oppoſite ſide of the member to the cuſhion upon the artery, the ſtrap is to be carried round the limb directly over the cuſhion, and to be firmly connected on the other side of the buckle. In thus connecting the ſtrap and buckle together, particular attention is neceſſary in doing it with great firmneſs; ſo as that the ſcrew may afterwards operate with as much advantage as poſſible in producing a ſufficient degree of preſſure. When proper attention is paid to this circumſtance, a ſingle turn of the ſcrew proves ſufficient for putting an entire ſtop to the circulation of blood in the limb: but when the ſtrap has not originally been made very tight, ſeveral turns of the ſcrew become neceſſary; an occurrence which may be always very eaſily prevented; and which, when not attended to, frequently proves very embarraſſing in the courſe of an operation.</p><p>Various methods have been invented for ſecuring arteries by means of ligatures. The practice till lately in ordinary uſe was, by means of a curved needle, to paſs a ligature of ſufficient ſtrength round the mouth of the bleeding veſſel, including a quarter of an inch all round oſ the ſurrounding parts, and afterwards to form a knot of a proper tightneſs upon the veſſel and other parts comprehended in the nooſe. But this method was found to give ſo much pain, and in ſome caſes to be attended with ſuch violent convulſions, not only in the part chiefly affected, but of the whole body, that the beſt practitioners have thought proper to reject it, and to tie up the blood-vessels by themſelves ; for it is now well known that even very ſmall arteries are poſſessed of much firmneſs ; and that even in the largeſt arteries a flight degree of compreſſion is ſufficient not only for reſtraining hemorrhagy, but for ſecuring the ligature on the very ſpot to which it is firſt applied.</p><p>In order to detect the arteries to be tied, the tourniquet, with which they are ſecured, muſt be ſlackened a little by a turn or two of the ſcrew ; and the moment the largeſt artery of the ſore is diſcovered, the ſurgeon fixes his eye upon it, and immediately reſtrains the blood again by means of the tourniquet. An aſſiſtant now forms a nooſe on the ligature to be made uſe of ; and this nooſe being put over the point of the tenaculum, Plate CCCCLXXXVII. fig. 17. the operator puſhes the ſharp point of the inſtrument through the ſides of the veſſel, and at the ſame time pulls ſo much of it out, over the ſurface of the ſurrounding parts, as he thinks is ſufficient to be included in the knot which the aſſiſtant is now to make upon the artery. In forming this ligature a ſingle knot moderately drawn, and over it another ſingle knot, is perfectly ſufficient.</p><p>When from the deepneſs of a wound, or from any other cauſe, ſome particular artery cannot be properly ſecured by the tenaculum ; in this caſe there is a neceſſity of employing the crooked needle, and the following is the method of uſing it.</p><p>A needle of the ſhape repreſented Pl. CCCCLXXXVII. fig. 14. armed with a ligature of a size proportioned to itſelf and to the veſſel to be taken up, is to be introduced at the diſtance of a ſixth or eighth part of an inch from the artery, and puſhed to a depth ſufficient for retaining it, at the ſame time that it is carried fully one half round the blood- veſſel. It muſt now be drawn out ; and being again puſhed forward till it has completely encircled the mouth of the artery, it is then to be pulled out ; and a knot to be tied of a ſufficient firmneſs, as was already directed when the tenaculum is uſed.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XI. <hi rend="italic">Of Aneurisms.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> term <hi rend="italic">Aneuriſm</hi> was originally meant to ſignify a tumor formed by the dilatation of the coats of an artery ; but by modern practitioners it is made to apply not only to tumors of this kind, but to ſuch as are formed by blood effuſed from arteries into the contiguous parts. There are three ſpecies ; the true or encyſted, the falſe or diffuſed, and the varicoſe aneuriſm.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">true</hi> or en <hi rend="italic">cysted</hi> aneuriſm, when ſituated near the ſurface of the body, produces a tumor at firſt ſmall and circumſcribed ; the ſkin retains its natural appearance ; when preſſed by the fingers, a pulſation is evidently diſtinguiſhed ; and with very little force the contents of the ſwelling may be made to diſappear ; but they immediately return upon removing the preſſure. By degrees the ſwelling increaſes, and becomes more prominent ; but ſtill the patient does not complain of pain : on preſſure the tumor continues of an equal ſoftneſs, and is compreſſible. After this the ſwelling becomes large, the ſkin turns paler than uſual, and in more advanced ſtages œdematous : the pulſe ſtill continues; but parts of the tumor become firm from the coagulation of the contained blood, and yield little to preſſure ; at laſt the ſwelling increaſes in a gradual manner, and is attended with a great degree oſ pain. The ſkin turns livid, and has a gangrenous appearance. An oozing of<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0130.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0124"/>
bloody serum occurs ſrom the integuments ; and, if a real mortification do not take place, the ſkin cracks in different parts ; and the artery being now deprived of the uſual resistance, the blood burſts out with ſuch force as to occasion the almoſt immediate death of the patient. Thus the diſeaſe teιminates in the large cavities of the body; but in the extremities we can, by means of the tourniquet, prevent the hidden termination of the diſeaſe.</p><p>When affections of this kind happen in the larger arteries, the effects produced upon the neighbouring parts are often ſurpriſing : the soft parts not only yield to a great extent, but even the bones frequently undergo a great degree of derangement.</p><p>The f <hi rend="italic">alſe</hi> or <hi rend="italic">diffuſed</hi> aneuriſm conſiſts in a wound or rupture in an artery, producing, by the blood thrown out of it, a ſwelling in the contiguous parts. It is moſt frequently produced by a wound made directly into the artery.</p><p>The following is the uſual progreſs of the diſorder. A tumor, about the size of a horſe bean, generally rises at the orifice in the artery ſoon after the diſcharge of the blood has been stopped by compreſſion. At firſt it is ſoft, has a strong degree of puliation, and yields a little to preſſure, but cannot be made entirely to diſappear ; ſor here the. blood forming the tumor being at rest, begins to coagulate. If not improperly treated by much preſſure, it generally remains nearly of the ſame ſize for ſeveral weeks. The enlargement however proceeds more rapidly in some caſes than in others. Inſtances have occurred of the blood being diffuſed over the whole arm in the ſpace of a few hours ; while, on the contrary, ſwellings of this kind have been many months, nay even years, in arriving at any conſiderable ſize.</p><p>As the tumor becomes larger, it does not, like the true aneuriſm, grow much mote prominent, but rather ſpreads and diffuſes itſelf into the ſurrounding parts. By degrees it acquires a firm conſiſtence ; and the pulſation, which was at firſt conſiderable, gradually diminiſhes, till it is ſometimes ſcarcely perceptible. If the blood at firſt thrown out proceed from an artery deeply ſeated, the ſkin preſerves its natural appearance till the diſorder is far advanced : but when the blood gets at firſt into contact with the ſkin, the parts become inſtantly livid, indicating the approach of mortification ; and a real ſphacelus has ſometimes been induced. The tumor at firſt produces little uneaſineſs ; but as it increaſes in ſize, the patient complains of ſevere pain, stiffneſs, numbneſs, and immobility of the whole joint ; and theſe ſymptoms continuing to augment, if the artery be large, and aſſiſtance not given, the teguments at laſt burst, and death muſt enſue.</p><p>When an artery is punctured through a vein, as in bloodletting at the arm, the blood generally ruſhes into the yielding cellular ſubſtance, and there ſpreads ſo as to ſhut the ſides of the vein together. But in ſome inſtances where the artery happens to be in contact with the vein, the communication opened has been preſerved; and the vein not being ſufficiently ſtrong for refilling the impulſe of the artery, muſt conſequently be dilated. This is a varicoſe aneuriſm. It was firſt accurately deſcribed by Dr Hunter, and since that time has been frequently obſerved by different practitioners. Here the ſwelling is entirely confined to the veins. Soon after the injury the vein immediately communicating with the artery begins to swell, and enlarge gradually. If there be any conſiderable communications in the neighbourhood, the veins which form them are alſo enlarged. The tumor diſappears upon preſſure, the blood contained in it being chiefly pushed forwards in its courſe towards the heart ; and when the tumor is large, there is a singular tremulous motion, attended with a perpetual hiſſing noise, as if air was passing into it through a ſmall aperture.</p><p>If a ligature be applied upon the limb immediately below the ſwelling, tight enough to ſtop the pulſe in the under part of the member, the swelling diſappears by preſſure, but returns immediately upon the preſſure being removed. If, after the ſwelling is removed by pressure, the finger be placed upon the orifice in the artery, the veins remain perfectly flaccid till the preſſure is taken off. If the trunk of the artery be compreſſed above the orifice ſo as effectually to ſtop the circulation, the tremulous motion and hiſſing immediately ceaſe ; and if the veins be now emptied by pressure, they remain so till the compreſſion upon the artery be removed. If the vein be compreſſed a little above, as well as below the tumor, all the blood may generally, though not always, be puſhed through the orifice into the artery ; from whence it immediately returns on the preſſure being diſontinued.</p><p>When the diſeaſe has continued long, and the dilatation of the veins has become conſiderable, the trunk of the artery above the orifice generally becomes greatly enlarged, while that below becomes proportionably small ; of consequence the pulse in the under part of the member is always more feeble than in the sound limb of the oppoſite ſide.</p><p>The cauſes producing aneuriſms, in general, are a natural, diſeaſe of the arteries. Thus a partial debility of their coats may readily produce the diſeaſe ; or they may ariſe, eſpecially in the internal parts of the body, from great bodily exertions. They are likewiſe produced by wounds of the coats of the arteries, as now and then happens in bloodletting at the arm ; or from acrid matter contained in a neighbouring ſore ; or from the deſtruction of ſurrounding parts, by which the natural ſupport is removed.</p><p>Aneuriſms have frequently been miſtaken ſor abſceſſes and other collections of matter, and have been laid open by inciſion ; on which account great attention is sometimes required to make the proper diſtinction. In the commencement of the diſeaſe the pulſation in the tumor is commonly ſo ſtrong, and other concomitant circumſtances so evidently point out the nature of the diſorder, that little or no doubt reſpecting it can ever take place ; but in the more advanced ſtages of the diſeaſe, when the ſwelling has become large and has lost its pulsation, nothing but a minute attention to the previous hiſtory of the caſe can enable the practitioner to form a judgment of its nature.</p><p>Aneuriſms may be confounded with ſoft encyſted tumors, ſcrophulous ſwellings, and abſcesses ſituated so near to an artery as to be affected by its puliation. But one ſymptom, when connected with ſtrong pulſation, may always lead to a certain determination that the ſwelling is of the aneurismal kind, viz. the contents of the tumor being made eaſily to diſappear upon preſſure, and their returning on the compreſſion being removed. The want of this circumſtance, however, ought not to convince us that it is not of that nature ; for it frequently happens, eſpecially in the advanced ſtages of aneuriſms, that their contents become ſo firm that no effect is produced upon them by preſſure. Hence the propriety, in doubtful cases, of proceeding as if the diſease was clearly of the aneuriſmal kind.</p><p>In the prognoſis, three circumſtances are chiefly to be attended to ; the manner in which the diſeaſe appears to have been produced, the part of the body in which the ſwelling is situated, and the age and habit of the body of the patient.</p><p>If an aneuriſm has come forward in a gradual manner, without any apparent injury done to the part, and not ſucceeding any violent bodily exertion, there will be reason to<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0131.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0125"/>
ſuppoſe that the diſeaſe depends upon a general affection either of the trunk in which it occurs, or of the whole arterious ſyſtem. In ſuch caſes art can give little asiſtance : whereas if the tumor has ſucceeded an external accident, an operation may be attended with ſucceſs.</p><p>In the varicoſe aneuriſm a more favourable prognoſis may generally be given than in either of the other two ſpecies. It does not proceed ſo rapidly; when it has arrived at a certain length, it does not afterwards acquire much additional ſize ; and it may be ſuſtained without much inconvenience for a great number of years. As long as there is reaſon to expect this, the hazard which almoſt always attends the operation ought to be avoided.</p><p>In the second volume of the London Medical Obſervations, two caſes are related by Dr Hunter of the varicoſe aneuriſm. One of them at that time was of 14 years standing, and the other had ſubsisted for five years, without there being any neceſſity for an operation. And in vol. iii. of the same work a ſimilar caſe of five years duration is related by Dr Cleghorn.</p><p>In a letter afterwards from Dr Hunter to Mr Benjamin Bell, the Doctor ſays, “ The lady in whom I firſt obſerved the varicose aneuriſm is now living at Bath in good health, and the arm is in no ſenſe worſe, although it is now 35 years since she received the injury:” and the Doctor farther obſerves, that he never heard of the operation being performed for the varicoſe aneuriſm which was known to be ſuch.</p><p>Mr Dell says, he was informed by Dr William Cleghorn of Dublin, that the caſe of varicoſe aneuriſm, related in the 3d volume of the London Medical Obſervations, remained nearly in the ſame ſtate as at the time that account of it was made out, which included a period of at leaſt 20 years; Only that the veins were rather more enlarged. The patient recovered, and the limb became nearly as ſtrong and ſerviceable as the other. Mr Pott alſo met with three different inſtances of this ſpecies of aneuriſm ; and obſerves, that the operation never became neceſſary in any of them.</p><p>Among other inſtances of varicoſe aneuriſm which have appeared here, a young man from Paiſley was examined ſeveral years ago by different ſurgeons of this place. The diſeaſe was very clearly marked, and no operation was adviſed. He was afterwards found ſerving in the navy, where he underwent great fatigue without any inconvenience from the aneuriſm, though then of 13 years ſtanding.</p><p>But though this aneuriſm, when it has arrived at a certain ſize, commonly remains ſtationary, and may be borne without mutch inconvenience for a long time, this is not always the case ; for ſome inſtances have occurred, where the diſeaſe was attended with great uneasineſs, and where the operation was performed with much difficulty.</p><p>In judging further of the probable evcnt of aneuriſms in general, the ſituation of the tumor next requires attention. When it is ſo ſituated that no ligature or effectual compreſſion can be applied for stopping the circulation in the part, if the artery be large, there would be the greatest danger in opening it. In this caſe therefore the most fatal conſequences are to be apprehended.</p><p>When aneuriſms are ſituated near the upper parts of the extremities, ſurgeons have been hitherto doubtful whether, after tying up the humeral or femoral arteries, the lower parts of the limb would be ſupplied with blood ; and tho’ ſeveral successful instances of performing that operation have been publiſhed, the ſuccess has been pretty generally aſcribed to unuſual branching of the great arteries of thoſe patients, on whom the operation was performed, above the aneuriſm. Mr John Bell, however, in his late very ingenious and important <hi rend="italic">Diſcourſes on Wounds,</hi> has proved, to our ſatisfaction at leaſt, that the inoſculations which take place between the internal iliac and the arteries of the leg, by means of the glutaeal arteries and the profunda femoris, are in every caſe ſufficient to ſupply nouriſhment to the limb ; that the ſame is the caſe in the arm ; and that therefore in every aneuriſm even of the humeral or femoral artery, we ought to perform the operation. Several inſtances of ſucceſs are there related ; among others, an operation performed by Mr J. Bell himſelf, which, as it is perhaps the greateſt that has hitherto been performed, we ſhall here a- bridge for the gratification of our readers. A leech-catcher fell as he was ſtepping out of a boat ; and a pair of long- pointed ſciſſars pierced his hip exactly over the ſciatic notch, where the great iliac artery comes out from the pelvis. The artery bled furiouſly : the patient fainted. The ſurgeon eaſily ſtopt up the wound, as it was very narrow and deep, and healed it. A great tumor ſoon formed. The man travelled from the north country in six weeks to the Edinburgh infirmary, with a prodigious tumor of the hip, the thigh rigidly contracted, the ham bent, the whole leg ſhrunk and cold and uſeleſs. There was no pulſation nor retrocesſion of blood on preſſure ; but the diſtenſion was attended with great pain, and the man was extremely anxious to have an operation performed. Though there was little doubt oſ its being aneuriſm, it might be a great abſeeſs. It was reſolved therefore to make a ſmall inciſion, and just touch the bag with the point of a lancet, and it it contained blood, a full conſultation was to be called. Mr Bell accordingly made an inciſion two inches and an half in length ; the great faſcia formed the coat of the tumor, and under it were ſeen the fibres of the great glutæus muſcle. As ſoon as it was opened at one point, great clots of blood came out ; and Mr Bell, after being certain that it was an aneuriſm of the great artery of the thigh, cloſed up the wound with a tent-like compreſs, put the patient to bed, and a pupil held his hand on the hip. This was done at one o’clock ; at four the conſultation met, and the operation was performed. On making an inciſion eight inches long, the blood was thrown out with a whishing noiſe, and with ſuch impetuoſity, that the assiſtants were covered with it. In a moment twenty hands were about the tumor, and the bag was filled with ſponges and cloths of all kinds ; the blood, however, ſtill made its way ; and the man who had ſupported himſelf on his elbow, fell down; his arms and head hung down, he uttered two or three heavy groans, and they thought him dead. At that critical moment Mr Bell ran the bistoury upwards and downwards, and at once made the wound two feet long ; thruſt his hand to the bottom of the tumor, felt the warm jet of blood, put his finger on the mouth of the artery, the pulſe of which he felt diſtinctly ; which firſt aſſured him that the man was alive. The artery was then tied ; and when Mr Bell lifted up his finger, it was diſcovered to be the posterior iliac ; that it had been cut fairly acroſs, and had bled with open mouth. The patient was ſo low, that after dreſſing the wound, they were obliged to bring in a bed, and leave him to ſleep in the operation room. He was cured or this great wound in less than ſeven months, and afterwards recovered the uſe of his leg completely.</p><p>In every case of aneuriſm, the uſe of preſſure has been indiscriminately recommended, not only in the incipient period of the diseaſe, but even in its more advanced ſtages.</p><p>In the diffuſed or false aneurilm, as preſſure cannot be applied to the artery alone, without at the fame time affecting the refluent veins ; and as this, by producing an increaſed reſistance to the arterial pulſations, muſt force an additional quantity of blood to the orifice in the artery—no advantage<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0132.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0126"/>
is to be expected from it, though it may be productive of miſchief.</p><p>In the early stages of encyſted aneuriſm, while the blood can be yet preſſed entirely out of the ſac into the artery, it often happens, by the uſe of a bandage of ſoft and ſomewhat elaſtic materials, properly fitted to the part, that much may be done in preventing the ſwelling from receiving any degree of increaſe; and on ſome occaſions, by the continued ſupport thus given to the weakened artery, complete cures have been at laſt obtained. In all ſuch caſes, therefore, particularly in every inſtance of the varicoſe aneuriſm, much advantage may be expected from moderate pressure.</p><p>But preſſure, even in encyſted aneuriſm, ought never to be carried to any great length ; for tight bandages, by producing an immoderate degree of reaction in the containing parts to which they are applied, inſtead of anſwering the purpoſe for which they were intended, have evidently the contrary effect. Indeed the greateſt length to which preſſure in ſuch caſes ought to go, ſhould be to ſerve as an eaſy ſupport to the parts affected, and no farther.</p><p>In performing the operation for aneuriſm, the firſt ſtep ought to be to obtain a full command of the circulation in the inferior part of the member by means of the tourniquet. This being done, the patient ſhould be ſo placed, that the diſeaſed limb, on being ſtretched on a table, is found to be of a proper height for the ſurgeon ; who, as the operation is generally tedious, ought to be ſeated. The limb being properly ſecured by an aſſiſtant, the operator is now with the ſcalpel, Plate CCCCLXXXVII. fig. 18. to make an inciſion through the ſkin and cellular ſubſtance along the whole courſe of the tumor ; and as freedom in the remaining parts of the operation is here a matter of much importance, it is even of uſe to carry this external inciſion half an inch or ſo both above and below the fartheſt extremities of the ſwelling.</p><p>All the effuſed blood ought then to be wiped off by means of a ſponge ; and the ſofteſt part of the tumor being diſcovered, an opening ought there to be made into it with the lancet, Plate CCCCLXXXVII. fig. 19. large enough ſor admitting a finger of the operator’s left-hand. This being done, and the finger introduced into the cavity of the tumor, it is now to be laid open from one extremity to the other, by running a blunt-pointed biſtoury, Plate CCCCLXXXVII. fig. 20. along the finger from below upwards, and afterwards from above downwards, ſo as to lay the whole cavity fairly open.</p><p>The cavity of the tumor being thus laid freely open, all the coagulated blood is to be taken out by the fingers of the operator, together with a number of tough membranous filaments commonly found here. The cavity of the tumor is now to be rendered quite dry, and free from the blood which, on the firſt opening of the ſwelling, is diſcharged into it ſrom the veins in the inferior part of the member : the tourniquet is then to be ſlackened to diſcover, not only the artery itſelf, but the opening into it, from whence the blood collected in the tumor has been all along diſcharged. This being done, the next point to be determined is the manner of ſecuring this opening into the artery, ſo as to prevent in future any farther effuſion of blood. Various means have been propoſed for accompliſhing this ; but the effects of all of them may be comprehended under the three following heads.</p><p>1. The effects of ligature upon a large artery having on ſome occaſions proved fatal to the inferior part of the member, it was long ago propoſed, that ſo ſoon as the opening into the artery has been diſcovered, inſtead of applying a Ligature round it, which for certain is to obliterate its cavity entirely, a piece of agaric, vitriol, alum, or any other aſtringent ſubſtance, ſhould be applied to the orifice, in order if poſſible to produce a reunion of its ſides.</p><p>2. Upon the ſame principle with the preceding, viz. that of ſtill preſerving the circulation in the artery, it was ſeveral years ago propoſed by an eminent ſurgeon of Newcaſtle, Mr Lambert, that the orifice in the artery ſhould be ſecured by means of the twiſted suture. A ſmall needle being puſhed through the edges of the wound, they are then directed to be drawn together by a thread properly twiſted round the needle, as was formerly directed when treating of sutures.</p><p>Strong objections, however, occur to both of theſe methods. In the firſt place, no aſtringent application with which we are acquainted is posseſſed of ſuch powers as to deserve much confidence. In almoſt every inſtance in which they have been uſed, the hemorrhagy has recurred again and again, ſo as to prove very diſtreſſing, not only to the patient, but to the practitioner in attendance ; little or no attention is therefore to be paid to remedies of this kind in ordinary practice.</p><p>Mr Lambert’s method of ſtitching the orifice in the artery is certainly a very ingenious propoſal ; and would in all probability, at leaſt in moſt inſtances, prove an effectual ſtop to all farther diſcharge of blood : but as we have yet only one inſtance of its ſucceſs, little can be ſaid about it. Two material objections, however, ſeem to occur to this practice. One is, that in the operation for the aneuriſm, in almoſt every inſtance, a very few only excepted, the artery lies at the back-part of the tumor; ſo that when all the collected blood is removed, there is ſuch a depth of wound, that it muſt be always a very difficult matter, and on many occaſions quite impracticable, to perform this nice operation upon the artery with that attention and exactneſs which, in order to ensure ſucceſs, it certainly requires. But there is another very material objection. By introducing a needle through the ſides of the orifice, and drawing theſe together by a ligature, the cavity of the artery muſt undoubtedly be at that point much diminiſhed. Indeed Mr Lambert, in his account of the caſe in which this operation was performed, acknowledges that the diameter of the artery was thereby diminiſhed. Now the paſſage of the blood being thus contracted at one point, the impulſe upon that particular part muſt be very conſiderable : So that the very remedy employed for the cure of one ſpecies of aneuriſm, will in all probability prove a very powerful agent in inducing another ; for the blood being thus obſtructed in its uſual courſe, there will be no ſmall danger incurred of a dilatation being produced immediately above this preternatural ſtricture.</p><p>3. Neither of the methods we have yet been conſidering being found eligible for ſecuring the orifice in the artery, we ſhall now proceed to deſcribe the ordinary manner of performing this operation ; which conſiſts in obliterating the arterial cavity entirely by means oſ ligatures.</p><p>The artery being laid bare in the manner directed, and all the coagulated blood being carefully removed from the cavity of the tumor, on the tourniquet being now ſlackened ſo as to bring the orifice in the artery into view, a ſmall probe curved at the extremity is to be introduced at the opening, in order to raiſe the artery from the neighbouring parts, ſo as that the ſurgeon may be enabled with certainty to paſs a ligature round it, without comprehending the contiguous nerves, which in general run very near to the large blood-veſſels of a limb. By this precaution the nerves may be always avoided ; and by doing ſo, a great deal of miſchief may be prevented, which otherwiſe might ſupervene.

the knee or of the elbow, as it relaxes the artery a little, renders this part of the operation more eaſily effected than when the limbs are kept fully ſtretched out.</p><p>The artery being thus gently ſeparated from the contiguous parts, a firm waxed ligature muſt be paſſed round it, about the eighth part of an inch or ſo above the orifice, and another muſt in the ſame manner be introduced at the ſame diſtance below it.</p><p>The ligatures being both finiſhed in the manner directed, the tourniquet is now to be made quite looſe ; and if no blood is diſcharged at the orifice in the artery, we may then reſt ſatisfied that the operation is ſo far properly completed.</p><p>The wound is now to be lightly covered with ſoft lint, with a pledgit of any emollient ointment over the whole ; and a compreſs of linen being applied over the dresſings, all the bandage in any degree requiſite is two or three turns of a roller above and as many below the centre of the wound, making it preſs with no more tightneſs than is abſolutely neceſſary for retaining the application we have juſt now mentioned.</p><p>The patient being now put into bed, the member ſhould be laid in a relaxed poſture upon a pillow, and ought to be ſo placed as to create the leaſt poſſible uneaſineſs ſrom the poſture in which it is laid.</p><p>As the operation for the aneuriſm is always tedious, and produces much pain and irritation, a full dose of laudanum ſhould be given immediately on the patient being got into bed. In order to diminiſh ſenſibility during ſome of the more capital operations, different trials have been made of opiates given an hour or ſo before the operation. On ſome occaſions this proved evidently very uſeful ; but in others it ſeemed to have the contrary effect ; particularly in weak nervous conſtitutions, in which with any doſes, however ſmall, they appeared to be rendered more irritable and more suſceptible of pain, than if no opiate had been given. Immediately after this operation, however, an opiate ought to be exhibited, to be repeated occaſionally according to the degrees of pain and reſtlessneſs.</p><p>In ſome few caſes of aneuriſm, it has happened that the pulſe in the under part of the member has been diſcovered immediately after the operation. This, however, is a very rare occurrence : For as this diſorder is ſeldom met with in any other part than at the joint of the elbow as a conſequence of blood-letting, and as it rarely happens that the brachial artery divides till it paſſes an inch or two below that place, the trunk of this artery is therefore moſt frequently wounded ; and when, accordingly, the ligature, in this operation, is made to obliterate the paſſage of almoſt the whole blood which went to the under part of the arm, there cannot be the leaſt reaſon to expect any pulſation at the wriſt, till in a gradual manner the anaſtomoſing branches of the artery have become ſo much enlarged as to tranſmit ſuch a quantity of blood to the inferior part of the member as is ſufficient for acting as a ſtimulus to the larger branches of the artery.</p><p>Immediately after the operation, the patient complains of an unuſual numbneſs or want of feeling in the whoſe member ; and as it generally, for a few hours, becomes cold, it is therefore right to keep it properly covered with warm ſoft flannel ; and in order to ſerve as a gentle ſtimulus to the parts below, moderate frictions appear to be of uſe. In the ſpace of ten or twelve hours from the operation, although the numbneſs ſtill continues, the heat of the parts generally begins to return ; and it frequently happens, in the courſe of a few hours more, that all the inferior part of the member becomes even preternaturally warm.</p><p>Immediately after this operation, the want of feeling in the parts is often very great ; and in proportion as the circulation in the under part of the member becomes more conſiderable, the degree of feeling alſo augments. If we could ſuppoſe the nerves of the parts below to be always included in the ligature with the artery, that numbneſs which ſucceeds immediately to the operation might be eaſily accounted for ; but it has been alſo known to happen when nothing but the artery was ſecured by the ligature.</p><p>In the mean time, the patient being properly attended to as to regimen, by giving him cordials and nouriſhing diet when low and reduced, and confining him to a low diet if his conſtitution is plethoric, the limb being ſtill kept in an eaſy relaxed poſture, towards the end of the fourth or fifth day, ſometimes much ſooner, a very weak feeble pulſe is diſcovered in the under part of the member, which becoming ſtronger in a gradual manner, the patient in the ſame proportion recovers the uſe and feeling of the parts.</p><p>So ſoon as there is an appearance of matter having formed freely about the sore, which will ſeldom happen before the fifth or ſixth day, an emollient poultice ſhould be applied over it for a few hours, in order to ſoften the dreſſings, which may be then removed. At this time the ligatures might be taken away ; but as their continuance for a day or two longer can do no harm, it is better to allow them to remain till the second or third dreſſing, when they either drop off themſelves, or may be taken away with perfect ſafety. The dreſſings, which ſhould always be of the ſofteſt materials, being renewed every second or third day according to the quantity of matter produced, the ſore is in general found to heal very eaſily ; and although the patient may for a conſiderable time complain of great numbneſs and want of ſtrength in the whoſe courſe of the diſeaſed limb, yet in moſt inſtances a very free uſe of it is at laſt obtained.</p><p>Very often after the artery ſeems to be ſecured it gives way, and fatal hemorrhagies enſue ; nor is the patient free from this danger for a great length of time. In one of Mr Hunter’s operations the artery gave way on the 26th day. It is to this difficulty of procuring adheſion between the ſides of the artery that a great part of the danger of this operation is to be aſcribed.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XII. <hi rend="italic">Of Affections of the Brain from External Violence.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">When</hi> the brain is compreſſed, a ſet of ſymptoms enſue extremely dangerous, though ſometimes they do not make their appearance till after a conſiderable interval. But at whatever time they appear, they are uniformly of the same kind, and are in general as follow : drowſineſs, giddineſs, and ſtupefaction, dimneſs of sight, dilatation of the pupil ; and, where the injury done to the head is great, there is commonly a diſcharge of blood from the eyes, noſe, and ears. Sometimes the fractured bone can be diſcovered through the integuments, at others it cannot. There is an irregular and oppressed pulſe, and ſnoring or apoplectic ſtertor in breathing.

The firſt ſet of cauſes ſhall be conſidered in their order. The four laſt mentioned belong to the province of the phyſician, and have been conſidered in a former part of this Work.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">sect</hi>. 1. <hi rend="italic">Of Fracture and Depression of the Cranium producing Compreſſion of the Brain.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fractures</hi> of the cranium have been differently diſtinguiſhed by different authors ; but it ſeems ſufficient to divide them into thoſe attended with depreſſion, and thoſe which are not ſo.</p><p>In fracture and depreſſion of the cranium, the treatment ought to be,—to diſcover the ſituation and extent of the fracture ;—to obviate the effects of the injury done to the brain, by raiſing or removing all the depreſſed parts of the bone ;— to endeavour to complete the cure by proper dreſſings, and attention to the after treatment.</p><p>When the teguments correſponding to the injury done to the bone are cut or lacerated, and, as is ſometimes the caſe, entirely removed, the ſtate of the fracture is immediately diſcovered ; but when the integuments of the ſkull remain entire, even though the general ſymptoms of fracture be preſent, there is ſometimes much difficulty in aſcertaining it. When, however, any external injury appears, particularly a tumor from a recent contuſion, attended by the ſymptoms already deſcribed, there can be no doubt of the exiſtence of a fracture. But it ſometimes happens that compreſſion exiſts without the ſmalleſt appearance of tumor. In ſuch caſes, the whole head ought to be ſhaved, when an inflammatory ſpot may frequently be obſerved. Sometimes the place of the fracture has been diſcovered by the patient applying the hand frequently on or near ſome particular part of the head.</p><p>When the ſymptoms of a compreſſed brain are evidently marked, no time ought to be loſt in ſetting about an examination of the ſtate of the cranium, wherever appearances point out, or even lead us to conjecture, in what part a fracture may be ſituated. For this purpoſe an inciſion is to be made upon the ſpot through the integuments to the ſurface of the bone, which muſt be ſufficiently expoſed to admit of a free examination.</p><p>Some authors have recommended a crucial inciſion; others one in form of the letter T ; while many adviſe a conſiderable part of the integuments to be entirely removed. But as it is more agreeable to the preſent mode of practice to save as much of the ſkin as poſſible, a ſimple inciſion is generally preferred, unleſs the fracture run in different directions, and then the inciſion muſt vary accordingly. It will frequently happen, that a conſiderable part of the integuments muſt be ſeparated from the ſkull, in order to obtain a distinct view of the full extent of the fracture ; but no part of the integuments is to be entirely removed.</p><p>When blood-vessels of any conſiderable ſize are divided, either before or in time of the examination, they ought to be allowed to blood freely, as in no caſe whatever is the loſs of blood attended with more advantage than the preſent. When, however, it appears that the patient has loſt a ſufficient quantity, the veſſels ought to be ſecured.</p><p>After the integuments have been divided, if the ſkull be found to be fractured and depreſſed, the nature of the caſe is rendered evident; but even where there is no external appearance of fracture, tumor, diſcoloration, or other injury, if the patient continue to labour under ſymptoms of a compreſſed brain, if the pericranium has been ſeparated from the bone, and eſpecially if the bone has loſt its natural appearance, and has acquired a pale white or duſky yellow hue, the trepan ought to be applied without heſitation at the place where theſe appearances mark the principal seat of the injury.</p><p>Again, although no mark either of fracture or of any diſeaſes underneath ſhould appear on the outer table of the bone, yet there is a poſſibility that the inner table may be fractured and depreſſed. This indeed is not a common occurrence, but it happens probably more frequently than ſurgeons have been aware of ; and where it does happen, the injury done to the brain is as great, and attended with as much danger, as where the whole thickneſs of the bone is beat in. The application of the trepan is therefore neceſſary.</p><p>But if, after the application of the trepan, it happens that no mark of injury appears either in the outer or inner table in that part, or in the dura mater below it, and that the ſymptoms of a compreſſed brain ſtill continue, a fracture in ſome other part is to be ſuſpected ; or that kind of fracture termed by practitioners <hi rend="italic">counter fissure,</hi> where the ſkull is fractured and ſometimes depreſſed on the oppoſite ſide to, or at a diſtance from, the part where the injury was received. This is fortunately not a very frequent occurrence, and has even been doubted by ſome ; but different inſtances of it have, beyond all queſtion, been found. If therefore the operation of the trepan has been performed, and no fracture is diſcovered, no extravaſation appears on the ſurface of the brain ; and if blood letting and other means uſually employed do not remove the ſymptoms of compreſſion, the operator is to ſearch for a fracture on ſome other part. The whole head ſhould again be examined with much accuracy ; and, by preſſing deliberately but firmly over every part of it, if the ſmalleſt degree of ſenſibility remains, the patient will ſhow ſigns of pain, either by moans or by raiſing his hands, when preſſure is made over the fractured part. In this way fractures have been frequently detected, which might otherwiſe have been concealed.</p><p>Having now conſidered every thing preparatory to the operation of the trepan, we ſhall next point out the means beſt adapted for the removal or elevation of a depreſſed portion of the bone.</p><p>The firſt thing to be done is, after ſhaving the head, to make an inciſion as deep as the bone, and directly upon the courſe of the fracture.</p><p>The patient ought to be laid on a table, with a mattress under him, while his head is placed upon a pillow, and ſecured by an aſſiſtant. When the extent of the fracture has been determined, and the bleeding from the inciſion stopped, the depreſſed bone is now to be elevated ; but previous to this it is neceſſary to ſearch for detached pieces. Should any be found, they ought to be removed by a pair of forceps adapted to this purpoſe. By the ſame inſtrument any ſplinters of bone which may have been beaten in may be removed ; but when a part of the bone is beaten in beyond the level of the reſt of the cranium, as much of the pericranium is then to be removed by a raspatory, Plate CCCCLXXXVIII. fig. 21. as will allow the trephine, Plate CCCCLXXXVIII. fig. 22. to be applied; or, if the operator incline, for the sake of dispatch, he may uſe the trepan,<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0135.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0129"/>
Plate CCCCLXXXVIII. fig. 23. and 24.; or the operation may be begun and finiſhed with the trephine, while the trepan may perform the middle and principal part of the work. This part of the work is begun by making a hole with the perforator (fig. 24.), which is ſcrewed on to the lower end of fig. 23. deep enough to fix the central pin of the trephine, in order to prevent the ſaw from slipping out of its central courſe, till it has formed a groove ſufficiently deep to be worked ſteadily in ; and then the pin is to be removed. If the bone be thick, the teeth of the ſaw muſt be cleaned now and then by the bruſh (fig. 25.) during the perforation, and dipped in oil as often as it is cleaned, which will conſiderably facilitate the motion, and render it more expeditious ; making it at the ſame time much leſs diſagreeable to the patient, if he poſſeſs his ſenſes. That no time may be loſt, the operator ought to be provided with two inſtruments of the ſame ſize, or at leaſt to have two heade which can be readily fitted to the ſame handle.</p><p>After having made ſome progreſs in the operation, the groove ought to be frequently examined with a pick-tooth, or ſome ſuch inſtrument, in order to diſcover its depth ; and if one ſide happen to be deeper than the other, the operator ought to preſs more on that ſide which is ſhalloweſt. Precautions are more particularly neceſſary when the operation is performed upon a part of the ſkull which is of an unequal thickneſs, eſpecially after the inſtrument has paſſed the diploe. And though it be ſaid by writers in general that the inſtrument may be worked boldly till it comes at the diploe (which is generally known by the appearance of blood), yet the operator ſhould be upon his guard in this point, examining from time to time if the piece be looſe, left thro’ inadvertence the dura mater be wounded ; for in ſome parts of the ſkull there is naturally very little diploe, and in old subjects ſcarcely any. It ought likewiſe to be remembered, that the ſkulls of children are very thin. When the piece begins to vacillate, it ought to be ſnapped off with the forceps (fig. 26.), or levator (fig. 26. a <hi rend="smallcaps">)</hi>; for the ſawing ought by no means to be continued till the bone be cut quite through, otherwiſe the inſtrument may plunge in upon the brain, or at leaſt injure the dura mater. If the inner edge of the perforation be left ragged, it is to be ſmoothed with the lenticular (fig. 28. b), to prevent it from irritating the dura mater. Particular care is to be taken in uſing the inſtrument, left it ſhould preſs too much upon the brain.</p><p>The next ſtep is to raiſe the depreſſed part of the bone with the levator, or to extract the fragments of the bone, grumous blood, or any extraneous body. After this, if there appear reaſon to apprehend that blood, lymph, or matter, is contained under the dura mater, it ought to be cautiously opened with a lancet, endeavouring to avoid the blood-veſſels running upon it, or lying immediately under it.</p><p>When the trepan is to be uſed on account,of a fiſſure in which the bone will not yield, the inſtrument ſhould be applied ſo as to include part of it, if not directly over it, as it is moſt probable that the extravaſated fluid will be found directly under it. And when the fiſſure is of great extent, it may be proper to make a perforation at each end, if the whole can be conveniently brought into view ; and in ſome caſes ſeveral perforations may become neceſſary.</p><p>When it is propoſed to make ſeveral perforations to remove depreſſed fragments of the bone which are firmly fixed, and having the internal ſurface larger than the external, or to raiſe them ſufficiently, it is neceſſary to apply the trepan as near the fractured parts as poſſible ; making the perforations join each other, to prevent the trouble of cutting the intermediate ſpaces.</p><p>When the ſkull is injured over a future, and it is not thought adviſable to uſe the trepan, a perforation ought to be made on each ſide of the future, eſpecially in young ſubjects, in whom the dura mater adheres more ſtrongly than in adults ; becauſe there cannot be a free communication between the one ſide and the other, on account of the attachment of that membrane to the future.</p><p>After the elevation of the depreſſed pieces, or the removal of thoſe which are quite looſe, the extraction of extraneous bodies, and the evacuation of extravaſated fluids, &amp;c. the ſore is to be dressed in the lighteſt and eaſieſt manner ; all that is neceſſary being to apply a pledget of fine ſcraped lint, covered with simple ointment, to that part of the dura mater which is laid bare by the trepan, or otherwiſe ; after which the edges of the ſcalp are to be brought together or nearly ſo, and another pledget laid along the whole courſe of the wound ; a piece of fine ſoft linen is to be laid over all, and the dreſſings may be retained in their place by a common night-cap applied cloſe to the head, and properly fixed.</p><p>The patient is to be placed in as eaſy a poſition in bed as poſſible, with his head and ſhoulders elevated a little more than ordinary. If the operation be attended with ſucceſs, the patient will ſoon begin to ſhow favourable ſymptoms ; he will ſoon ſhow ſigns of increaſing ſenſibility, and the original bad ſymptoms will gradually diſappear. After this he ought to be kept as quiet as poſſible ; proper laxatives are to be adminiſtered, and ſuch as may be leaſt of a nauſeating nature. His food ought to be simple and eaſy of digeſtion, and his drink of the moſt diluent kind. If he complain of the wound being uneaſy, an emollient poultice ſhould be immediately applied, and renewed three or four times in the twenty-four hours. By theſe means there will commonly be a free ſuppuration from the whole ſurface of the ſore.</p><p>Every time the wound is dressed, the purulent matter ought to be wiped off from it with a fine warm ſponge ; and if any degree of sloughineſs take place on the dura mater or parts adjacent, it will then be completely ſeparated. Granulations will begin to form, which will continue to increaſe till the whole ariſe to a level with the ſurface of the cranium. The edges of the ſore are now to be dressed with cerate ſtraps, and the reſt of it covered with fine ſoft lint, kept gently preſſed on by the night-cap properly tied. In this way the cure will go on favourably ; luxuriance of granulations will commonly be prevented ; the parts will cicatrize kindly ; and as all the ſkin has been preſerved in making the firſt inciſion, the cicatrix will be but little obſerved.</p><p>But things do not always proceed in this favourable manner. Sometimes in a few hours after the operation the patient is ſeized with a kind of reſtleſſneſs, toſſing his arms, and endeavouring to move himſelf in bed, while the ſymptoms of a compreſſed brain remain nearly the ſame as formerly. In this caſe, eſpecially if the pulſe be quick and ſtrong, the patient ought to be bled freely, as there will be reaſon to ſuſpect ſome tendency to inflammation in the brain. Sometimes, though the trepan has been properly applied, the ſymptoms are not relieved, on account of extravaſated fluids collected internally under the dura mater, or between the pia mater and brain, or in the cavity of the ventricles. The danger in theſe caſes will be in proportion to the depth of the collection. Particular attention therefore ought always to be paid to the ſtate of the dura mater after the perforation has been made. If blood be collected below the dura mater, this membrane will be found tense, dark coloured, elaſtic, and even livid ; in which caſe, an opening becomes abſolutely neceſſary to diſcharge the extra-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0136.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0130"/>
vaſated fluid. Gentle ſcratches are to be made with a ſcalpel, till a probe (fig. 27 ), or directory (fig. 28.), can be introduced ; upon which the membrane is to be ſufficiently divided in a longitudinal, and ſometimes even in a crucial direction, till an outlet to the fluid be given.</p><p>After the dura mater has been cut in this manner, there is ſome danger of the brain protruding at the opening ; but the danger ſrom this is not equal to the bad effects ariſing from effuſed fluids compreſſing the brain.</p><p>A troubleſome and an alarming appearance now and then follows the operation of the trepan ; namely, the excrescences called <hi rend="italic">fungi,</hi> formerly ſuppoſed to grow immediately from the ſurface of the brain, but which, in general, originate from the ſurface of the dura mater or cut edge of the bone granulating too luxuriantly.</p><p>It often happens that they poſſeſs little ſenſibility ; and then the beſt method to prevent their riſing to any great height is to touch them frequently with lunar cauſtic ; but ſome caſes occur where their ſenſibility is ſo great that they cannot be touched, unleſs they hang by a ſmall neck ; and then a ligature may be put round them, and tightened from time to time till they drop off, which will commonly be in the courſe of a few days. It ſeldom happens, however, that there is any occaſion for applying ſuch means for the removal of theſe tumors, for they generally fall off as the perforations of the bone fill up.</p><p>If they do not, as the connection between them and the brain will be then in a great meaſure intercepted, they may be with more ſafety removed, either by excision, by cauſtic, or by ligature.</p><p>The cure being thus far completed, only a ſmall cicatrix will remain, and in general the parts will be nearly as firm as at firſt : but when much of the integuments have been ſeparated or deſtroyed, as they are never regenerated, the bone will be left covered only by a thin cuticle, with ſome ſmall quantity of cellular ſubſtance. When this is the caſe, the perſon ought to wear a piece of lead or tin, properly fitted and lined with flannel, to protect it from the cold and other external injuries.</p><p>This is the method now commonly practiſed in caſes of compreſſion ; but it frequently happens, that inſtead or compreſſion, ſuch a degree of concuſſion takes place that no aſſiſtance from the trepan can be attended with any advantage ; for the effects of concuſſion are totally different from thoſe of compreſſion, and therefore to be removed in a different manner.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Of Concuſſion of the Brain.</hi></p><p>By concuſſion of the brain is meant ſuch an injury, ſrom external violence, as either obſtructs or deſtroys its functions, without leaving behind it ſuch marks as to allow its nature to be aſcertained by dissection.</p><p>Moſt of the ſymptoms attending compression of the brain occur alſo in concuſſion ; but in a compreſſed ſtate of the brain they are more permanent. There is no diſcharge of blood from the eyes, noſe, or ears, which frequently happens in compreſſion ; and inſtead of that apoplectic ſtertor in breathing which accompanies compreſſion, the patient ſeems to be in a sound and natural ſleep. The pulſe is irregular and flow in compreſſion, and grows ſtronger and fuller by blood-letting ; but in concuſſion it is weaker, being ſoft and equal, and sinks by blood-letting. There are beſides convulſions in compreſſions, which are not obſerved in a ſtate of concuſſion. The ſymptoms ariſing from concuſſion come on immediately after the injury is received. In the violent degrees of theſe the patient remains quite inſenſible ; the pupils are much dilated, and do not contract though the eyes be expoſed to the ſtrongeſt light.</p><p>In more violent ſymptoms, eſpecially when the patient is rendered inſenſible, it is extremely difficult to diſtinguiſh between concuſſion and depreſſion ; for ſymptoms which have been ſuppoſed to ariſe entirely from concuſſion have, after death, been found to be owing to extravaſation or undiſcovered fracture ; and extravaſation has been blamed, when, on dissection, not the leaſt morbid appearance could be diſcovered.</p><p>In concuſſion the pulſe will frequently sink and become feeble, even after the diſcharge of eight or ten ounces of blood: In doubtful caſes, therefore, blood letting ſhould be practiſed with great caution. If the pulſe become fuller and ſtronger after diſcharging a moderate quantity, if the blood appear ſizy, and eſpecially if the patient become more ſenſible, it may be concluded that the ſymptoms depend upon extravaſation, depreſſion of the ſkull, or ſome degree of inflammation ; and as long as advantage ſeems to be derived from blood-letting, we may repeat it : but if, upon drawing a few ounces of blood, the pulſe becomes feeble, and eſpecially if along with this the patient become more weakly, we ſhould immediately deſiſt from any farther evacuation of blood ; and in place of it we ought to give ſuch remedies as may ſupport and ſtrengthen the patient : cordials ought to be given internally, and ſtimulants applied externally. Warm wine ſhould be given in proportion to the degree of debility induced ; the patient, who is apt, in this caſe, to become cold, ſhould be kept warm by proper coverings ; a bliſter ought to be put to all that part or the head in which the ſkin has not been injured ; sinapis ſhould be applied to the feet ; gentle laxatives are uſeful, and ſhould be regularly given, ſo as to keep the body open. If the patient cannot ſwallow wine in ſufficient quantity, volatile alkali, ardent ſpirits, and other cordials of a ſtimulating kind, ſhould be given. In concuſſions of the brain, Mr Bromeſield has recommended the uſe of opiates, and ſeveral other practitioners agree with him; though ſome conſider it as hurtful in the early ſtages of the diſorder, and are of opinion that even wine and other cordials ought to be given with ſome degree of caution. Iſſues, or the frequent repetition of bliſters to the different parts of the head and neck, by which an almoſt constant ſtimulus is preſerved, are much recommended. When patients are recovering from accidents of this kind, a liberal use of bark, ſteel, and mineral waters, &amp;c. have ſometimes been of ſervice. When the ſtomach is loaded, gentle vomits become neceſſary ; and white vitriol is reckoned the beſt in ſuch caſes. When much languor, inactivity, and loss of memory continue, electricity long applied has been attended with advantage. This remedy, however, would be hurtful where any ſymptoms of compreſſion or inflammation of the brain are preſent.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Of Inflammation of the Membranes of the Brain, or of the Brain itſelf from external violence.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Inflammation</hi> of the brain and of its membranes is attended with ſymptoms which occur in inflammations affecting other parts of the body, and from ſimilar cauſes, and likewiſe with ſymptoms peculiar to the brain itſelf. This diſorder differs esſentially from concuſſion in its not appearing immediately ; ſeldom till ſeveral days after the accident, and ſometimes not till two, three, or more weeks, or even as many months, have elapſed ; when the patient begins to feel an univerſal uneaſineſs over his head, attended with liſtleſſneſs, ſome degree of pain in the part upon which the injury was inflicted, though of this there was perhaps no previous ſenſation. Theſe ſymptons gradually increaſe ; the patient appears dull and ſtupid ; there is now a ſenſation of fulneſs, as if the brain were girt or compreſſed ; he complains of giddineſs and of nauſea, which ſometimes terminate in vomiting ; he is hot, and extremely uneaſy ; his<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0137.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0131"/>
ſleep is much diſturbed, neither natural ſleep nor that procured by opiates affording him relief ; the pulſe is hard and quick ; the face is fluſhed ; the eyes inflamed, and unable to bear an expoſure to much light. Sometimes, where a wound of the head accompanies theſe ſymptoms, its edges become hard and ſwelled, and an eryſipelatows inflammation ſpreads quickly over the whole head, and eſpecially towards the forehead and eyelids, which frequently ſwell to ſuch a degree as to ſhut up the eyes entirely. This ſwelling is ſoft and painful to the touch ; it receives the impreſſion of the finger, and frequently originates merely from the external wound ; on which account the attending ſymptoms are commonly eaſily removed by the means beſt ſuited to eryſipelas of the parts. In a few inſtances, however, this symptom is likewiſe connected with, and ſeems to originate from, ſome affection of the dura mater. Its tendency is then of the moſt dangerous kind, and therefore requires the greateſt attention. Soon after theſe ſymptoms become formidable, the part which received the blow begins to put on a diſeaſed appearance. If the bone has been expoſed by the accident, it now loses its natural complexion, becomes pale, white, and dry, either over its whole ſurface or in particular ſpots : but when the bone has not been denuded, nor the ſofter parts divided, but merely contuſed, they now ſwell, become puffy, and painful to the touch ; and when the head is shaved, the skin over the part affected is redder than the reſt of the ſcalp ; and if the ſwelled part be laid open, the pericranium will probably be found to be detached from the ſkull, and a little bloody fetid ichor will be obſerved between this membrane and the bone, which will be found diſcoloured in nearly the ſame manner as if it had been laid bare from the beginning.</p><p>By the application of proper remedies theſe ſymptoms are frequently entirely removed ; but when neglected, or when they do not yield to the means employed, they conſtantly become worſe. Delirium enſues ; the patient becomes extremely hot ; and is at times ſeized with slight ſhiverings, which continue to increaſe and are attended with ſome degree of coma or ſtupor. The former ſymptoms now in a great meaſure diſappear ; palſy of one ſide is ſoon followed by deep coma ; the pupils are dilated ; the urine and fæces are paſſed involuntarily ; ſubſultus tendinum and other convulsions enſue ; and death certainly follows, if the patient be not ſpeedily relieved.</p><p>Of the above ſymptoms, the firſt ſet point out the inflammatory, the other the ſuppurative, ſtage of the diſease. The remedies which are uſeful in the one are highly improper in the other. During the inflammatory ſtage, blood-letting is the principal remedy ; but this is improper after the suppurative ſymptoms appear, for then the trepan is the only thing that can give relief.</p><p>The indications of cure are ; 1. To employ the moſt effectual means for preventing inflammation. 2. To endeavour to procure the reſolution of inflammation by general and topical remedies. 3. When the inflammation cannot be removed by reſolution, and when ſuppuration has taken place, to give a free vent to the matter. 4. If the affected parts be attacked with gangrene, to endeavour to remove it and obviate its effects.</p><p>To anſwer the firſt indication, when the contuſion is conſiderable, blood-letting, both general and topical, ought to be employed, and to a conſiderable extent ; the bowels ought to be kept open by the uſe of laxatives ; a watery ſolution of ſaccharum ſaturni ſhould be applied to the part affected, and a low diet, with a total abſtinence from exercite, ought to be enjoined : but if theſe means fail, or, as frequently happens, the practitioner has not been called in ſoon enough for their proper application, and if inflammation have actually commenced, the second indication ought then to be attended to. For this purpoſe, blood-letting, not from the feet according to the advice of old practitioners, but as near as poſſible to the part affected, is to be performed, by leeching, cupping, or scarifying with a lancet or ſcalpel,</p><p>When, inſtead of this, general blood-letting is thought more adviſable, it is commonly reckoned beſt to open the external jugular vein, or the temporal artery ; and the rule, with regard to the quantity to be evacuated, ought to be, to draw blood as long as the pulſe continues firm ; so that, in violent caſes, taking away from 20 to 25 ounces at once will be found to anſwer the purpoſe better than to extract even a larger quantity, but at different intervals. A few hours afterwards, if the ſymptoms continue violent, it may be proper to diſcharge an additional quantity ; but this muſt depend upon the ſtrength of the patient and the fulneſs of the pulſe.</p><p>Along with the liberal uſe of blood-letting, brisk purgatives ſhould be given. The bowels ſhould not merely be kept open ; but in order to receive full advantage from the practice, a ſmart purging ſhould be kept up by repeated doſes of calomel, jalap, or ſome other neutral ſalt. Where the patient cannot ſwallow in ſufficient quantity, ſtimulating injections ſhould be frequently exhibited.</p><p>A moiſt ſtate of the skin is uſeful in every caſe of inflammation, and ought therefore to be here particularly attended to. In general a mild perſpiration may be induced by applying warm fomentations to the feet and legs, and by laying the patient in blankets inſtead of linen. But when theſe means are insufficient, diaphoretics or even ſudorifics may be given.</p><p>When much pain or reſtlessneſs takes place, opiates ſhould be adminiſtered freely, which are now found to be attended with real advantage.</p><p>With reſpect to the external treatment of this diſorder, attention ſhould be paid to thoſe means which may moſt readily induce a free diſcharge of purulent matter from the seat of the injury. With this view, if the original accident be attended with a wound or diviſion of the integuments, as the lips of the ſore are commonly obſerved to be hard, painful, and dry, it ſhould be covered with pledgets ſpread with an emollient ointment, and warm emollient poultices laid over the whole ; by which means, and eſpecially by a frequent renewal of the poultices, a free diſcharge of matter will commonly be induced, and the bad ſymptoms will generally be much mitigated, or entirely removed.</p><p>In caſes unattended with a diviſion of the integuments, as ſoon as it is ſuſpected that bad ſymptoms may ſupervene, the tumor ſhould be divided down to the pericranium ; and if that membrane be found ſeparated from the bone, it ought likewiſe to be divided ; and by inducing a ſuppuration in the way already mentioned, the inflammatory ſymptoms will probably be removed. As matter formed here is commonly of an acrid nature, and therefore apt to affect the bone, and by communication of veſſels the membranes under it, inſtead of wailing time till fluctuation be distinctly perceived, a free inciſion ſhould be made as ſoon as a tumor is obſervable. But this would be extremely improper in the treatment of tumors which immediately ſucceed to external injuries ; for it often happens that ſuch tumors diſappear ſpontaneously, or by the uſe of aſtringent applications. It is only when a tumor attended with pain appears at a diſtant period upon the ſpot where the injury was received, that it ought to be opened as ſoon as perceived.</p><p>The next part of the practice regards the remedies to be<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0138.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0132"/>
uſed when the diſorder has either proceeded to ſuppuration, or when, on a removal of a portion of the cranium, the dura mater is obſerved to be ſloughy with a tendency to gangrene ; and this includes the third and fourth indications of cure.</p><p>The ſuppurative ſtate of the diſeaſe is known by the inflammatory ſymptoms, inſtead of yielding to the remedies already adviſed, increaſing in violence ; and being ſucceeded by coma, dilatation of the pupils, a slow and full pulſe, involuntary discharge of fæces and urine, pally, and irregular convulſive motions, and eſpecially when theſe ſymptoms are ſucceeded by fits of rigor and ſhivering.</p><p>The exiſtence of matter within the cranium being aſcertained, as no other remedy can be depended upon for removing it, the operation of the trepan ſhould be immediately employed, and as many perforations ought to be made as may be ſufficient for evacuating the matter. But if, after the ſkull is perforated, little or no matter appear between the bone and membranes ; if the dura mater ſeem more tenſe than uſual ; this membrane is likewiſe to be opened, ſo as to give a free diſcharge to any matter which may be between the brain and its membranes.</p><p>When it is perceived that the dura mater has already become ſloughy, with ſome tendency to gangrene, the greateſt danger is to be dreaded. If mortification has commenced, there will be much reaſon to think that death will ſoon follow ; but different inſtances have occurred of ſloughs forming upon the dura mater, and of cures being made after theſe have ſeparated. All that can be attempted is to keep the sores clean, to give a free diſcharge to the matter, to apply nothing but light eaſy dreſſings, and to give bark in as great quantities as the ſtomach can bear. If there be still ſome tendency to inflammation, the diet ſhould be low and cooling, the patient ſhould drink freely of whey or other diluent liquors, and the bowels ſhould be kept moderately open : But if, on the contrary, the ſyſtem be low and the pulſe feeble, wine is the moſt effectual cordial.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV. <hi rend="italic">Of Fisſures, or simple Fractures of the Skull.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> term is here meant to imply a mere diviſion of one or both the tables of the ſkull, with or without a wound of the integuments, not attended with depreſſion. Fractures of this kind are not dangerous as far as affects the ſkull only, for it frequently happens that extenſive fissures heal without producing bad ſymptoms. But as they are frequently attended with effuſions of blood or ſerum upon the brain or its membranes, or as they may tend to excite inflammation in theſe, they require particular attention.</p><p>When effusions occur, ſymptoms of compreſſion immediately follow. The remedies beſt ſuited to this diſeaſe muſt then be applied ; and the trepan is alone to be depended upon. The fissures ſhould be traced through their whole extent, and a perforation made on the moſt depending part of each of them. If this be unſucceſsful, the operation ſhould be repeated along the courſe of the fissures as long as ſymptoms of a compressed brain continue ; and as the effuſed matter will commonly be found contiguous to the fissures, they ought to be included in each perforation.</p><p>If the fissure be ſo large as to produce an obvious ſeparation of the two ſides of the bone, the nature of the caſe will be at once rendered evident ; but where it is extremely ſmall, there is difficulty in diſtinguiſhing it from the natural sutures, or from sutures ſurrounding ſmall bones, which ſometimes occur, and get the name of <hi rend="italic">oſſa triquetra.</hi> But this may be known by the firmer adheſion which always exiſts between the pericranium and sutures ; whereas this membrane is always ſomewhat ſeparated from that part of the bone where a fissure is formed. When the pericranium is ſeparated by the accident for a conſiderable way from the ſurface of the bone, various means have been contrived for diſcovering the nature of the caſe ; as pouring ink upon the part ſuſpected to be fractured, which in caſe of a fracture cannot be wiped entirely off ; or making the patient hold a hair or piece of catgut between his teeth, while the other extremity of it is drawn tenſe, which, when ſtruck, is said to produce a diſagreeable ſenſation in the fractured part. But such teſts are little to be depended on ; ink will penetrate the futures ; and the others are ineffectual, unleſs the fracture be extenſive, and the pieces conſiderably ſeparated from each other. The oozing of the blood from a fiſſure is a better mark. The aſcertaining of this point, however, appears not very material ; for unleſs alarming ſymptoms are preſent, although there ſhould be a fiſſure, no opperation is neceſſary ; and if ſuch ſymptoms occur, the bone ought to be perforated whether there be a fiſſure or not.</p><p>When a fissure is not attended with ſymptoms oſ a compreſſed brain, the trepan ought not to be applied, eſpecially as the operation itſelf tends in ſome degree to increaſe inflammation of the part. The fiſſure ſhould be treated merely as a cauſe which may induce inflammation. The patient ſhould be blooded according to his ſtrength ; the bowels ſhould be kept lax, and the ſore treated with mild, eaſy dreſſing ; and violent exertion ſhould be avoided as long as there is any danger of inflammation occurring.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XIII. <hi rend="italic">Diſeaſes of the Eyes.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">Of Wounds of the Eyelids and Eyeball.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> caſes of ſuperficial wounds of the eyelids, it will be ſufficient to bring the edges of the wounds together and retain them in their place by slips of adheſive plaſter : but when a wound is deep, particularly when the tarsus is divided, it will be neceſſary to employ either the interrupted or the twiſted future, care being taken that the sutures be not carried through the inner membrane of the eyelid, otherwiſe the eye would be irritated and inflamed.

The firſt of theſe is the hordeolum or ſtye, which frequently grows on the edge of the eyelid, and is attended with heat, ſtiffneſs, and pain; and unleſs proper means be taken to prevent it, a ſuppuration is frequently the conſequence. It may be conſidered as a common abſceſs ſeated in an obſtructed ſebaceous duct or gland. It may generally be removed by diſcutient applications. Should theſe prove ineffectual, it ought to be brought to ſuppurate by a ſmall emollient poultice, when it will commonly heal of itſelf ; but if it do not, it may be opened with the point of a lancet, that the matter may be diſeharged ; and the part may be anointed afterwards with ſaturnine ſolution.</p><p>The eyelids are ſubject to encyſted tumors, ſteatoms, warts, &amp;c. which are to be treated like the ſame tumors when ſeated in other parts of the body ; only in extirpating theſe tumors, ſhould part of the eyelid be removed entirely, no dreſſings can be applied, as, however mild they may be, they would irritate and inflame the ball of the eye. All that can be done therefore, in ſuch caſes, is to lay the lips of the ſore as nearly together as poſſible, and frequently to remove any matter that may form on it.</p><p>The eyelaſhes are ſometimes ſo much inverted as to rub upon the eye and create much pain and inflammation. Various cauſes are aſſigned for this, ſuch as the hairs themſelves taking a wrong direction ; inverſion of the tarſus or cartilage of the eyelid ; ſome cicatrix formed upon the skin of this part after wounds or abſcesses ; tumors pressing the hairs in upon the eye ; and, finally, a relaxation of the external integuments.</p><p>The treatment of this diſorder muſt depend much upon a knowledge of the cauſe. When it is owing to a derangement of the cilia themſelves, if they have remained long in this ſtate, it will be extremely difficult to make them recover their proper direction. They ought therefore to be pulled out by a pair of forceps, and the part waſhed with ſome aſtringent lotion ; and if the new hairs appear to take a ſimilar direction, which is very apt to happen, as soon as they are long enough they ought to be turned back upon the eyelid, and kept there for ſeveral days, or even weeks, by adheſive plaſter. When the diſeaſe proceeds from a contraction of the orbicular muſcles, the contracted part may be cut from the inner ſurface of the eyelid ; in which place a cut commonly ſoon heals. If the caule proceed ſrom a tumor or cicatrix, this muſt be removed before a cure can be expected ; or if it be owing to relaxation of the ſkin, the parts ought to be bathed with ſome ſtrong aſtringent. If this fail, the relaxed skin ſhould be removed, and the part healed by the firſt intention. Sometimes the cilia of the upper eyelid are turned in on account of dropſical ſwelling in that place. When this happens, the water is to be evacuated by a few punctures with a lancet ; but when ſuch means fail, and when the diſeaſe is quite local, if viſion be diſturbed, a ſufficient part of the skin ought to be removed with a ſcalpel, and a cure made by adheſive plaſter or the twiſted future.</p><p>When the gaping eye takes place to any great degree, it is attended not only with much deformity and uneaſineſs, from a large portion of the lining of the eyelid being turned outwards, but likewiſe from too much of the eye being expoſed. The diſorder may ariſe from an enlargement of the eyeball, from dropſical ſwelling, or from the cicatrix of an old wound or abiceſs : hence it is frequently produced by the ſmall-pox, burns, or ſcrophula ; but more frequently by a laxity of the part in old age.</p><p>When the diſorder is induced by an enlargement of the ball of the eye, nothing but a removal of this ſwelling can be effectual. If from dropſical ſwelling, when this is connected with general anaſarca, the affection of the ſyſtem muſt firſt be cured ; but if it appear to be local, nothing anſwers ſo well as punctures. When it ariſes from a cicatrix, the ficin ſhould be divided, and the effects of inflammation guarded againſt. If it be owing to inflammation, the antiphlogiſtic courſe muſt be uſed ; when it ariſes from old age, the eyes ought to be daily bathed with cold water, or ſome aſtringent and ſtimulant ſolution.</p><p>Concretion of the eyelids ſometimes ariſes from a high degree of ophthalmia; in which caſe the eyelids are not only connected by their edges to each other, but now and then grow to the ſurface of the eyeball. A coheſion is ſometimes obſerved alſo in children at birth. When the adheſion is flight, it may in general be removed by the end of a blunt probe ; but when it is conſiderable, a cure can only be effected by a cautious dissection. If the eyelids on one ſide be found, they will ſerve as a guide to direct the inciſion. The tarsi are carefully to be divided from each other; after which, if there be no other adheſions, the eyelids may be readily opened : But if they adhere to the eye, the operator is gently to pull and ſeparate the eyelids, while the patient is deſired to move the eye in the oppoſite direction. When this is effected, nothing is further neceſſary than to drop a little oil upon the eye, and cover the eyelids with ſoft lint ſpread with ſome cooling emollient ointment. The oil and ointment are frequently to be repeated, and every precaution taken to prevent inflammation and irritation.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Of Specks, Films, or Excreſcences on the Eye.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Specks</hi> are ſometimes formed upon the white part of the eye, but more frequently upon the cornea. In the former caſe they are ſeldom attended with much inconvenience, but in the latter they are often the cauſe of partial or total blindneſs. They are almoſt univerſally the conſequence of inflammation, and ſeldom go much deeper than the tunica adnata. Two very different ſtates of the diſorder occur ; the one from an effuſion immediately under the outer layer of the cornea, and in this caſe the cornea does not appear to be raised ; the other takes place from one or more little ulcers, which breaking, leave as many opaque ſpots in the centre, which are more elevated than the reſt of the cornea : and the inconvenience attending either ſituation. muſt always be in proportion to their extent and degree of opacity, or their vicinity to the pupil. When viſion is little affected by them, they need ſcarcely be conſidered as an object of ſurgery ; but whenever viſion is materially impaired, remedies become necessary, and theſe ſhould be ſuch as are beſt ſuited for removing inflammation, promoting abſorption, and reſtoring tone to the veſſels. For the means adapted for removing inflammation, ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Medicine,</hi> n⁰ 175.</p><p>Veſſels running upon the ſurface of the eye into the ſpeck are to be divided, and the eye frequently bathed with ſome refrigerant collyrium. By theſe means the simpleſt kind of ſpecks, when recently formed, may generally be removed ; but where they have been of long, ſtanding, their removal is attended with great difficulty. Where the ſpeck is owing to an effuſion of fluids between the layers of the cornea, and where it is not attended with any prominence, local applications are of little advantage, as it.<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0140.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0134"/>
is impoſſible to remove the effuſed matter without injuring the cornea ; but conſiderable ſervice is derived from the uſe ogfsuch remedies as are moſt effectual for promoting abſorption ; and with this view a gentle, long continued courſe of mercury, brisk purgatives occasionally, and issues in the neck, are found to be the moſt effectual remedies.</p><p>In the management of ſpecks- which are prominent upon the cornea, and where inflammation is removed and the opacity is conſiderable, if the cornea beneath be ſound, the removal of the diseased part will leave it tranſparent and fit for viſion. The remedies proper ſor this purpoſe are eſcharotics or the knife. The former are applied in the form of a powder, an ointment, or a waſh ; and theſe ought to be very finely prepared, otherwiſe they will be in danger of irritating and inflaming the eye ; and they ought merely to be of such ſtrength as the eye can eaſily bear.</p><p>The applications ſhould be long perſiſted in and frequently repeated; and to make them ſtill more uſeful, ſome of the powders or ointments may be applied evening and morning, and the ſolution two or three times through the courſe of the day. To the remedies already mentioned cauſtic is ſometimes preferred. With this the centre of the ſpeck is to be frequently touched, till the patient complain of conſiderable pain, when pure water is to be applied by a pencil, or by dipping the eye in water, with the eyelids open, till the pain occaſioned by the application of the cauſtic be removed. The eye is then to be covered with compresses moiſtened in ſome ſolution, and this frequently repeated. The cauſtic to be repeated every second or third day, unleſs prevented by inflammation. When the ſurgeon chooſes to employ the knife, which frequently may be more effectual, the eye is to be fixed by a ſpeculum (fig. 29.), or levator (fig. 30) ; the tumor is then to be cautiously ſeparated by means of a ſmall knife, and every attention paid to pre-inflammation. Theſe are the methods moſt likely to be of ſervice ; and when properly managed, they will frequently remove specks, which otherwiſe would entirely deprive the patient of the uſe of the eye ; though it is to be regretted that caſes frequently occur which baffle art.</p><p>A membranous excreſcence, called pterygium, is frequently ſound upon the white part oſ the eye, which often ſpreads over the cornea ſo as entirely to deſtroy viſion. It is ſometimes owing to external injuries ; at other times it ariſes from a general diſeaſe of the ſyſtem, as lues venerea or ſcrophula ; but inflammation is always the more immediate cauſe.</p><p>By a proper application of the remedies above mentioned affections of this kind may generally be prevented from becoming formidable ; but when the reverſe takes place, and excreſcences begin to ſpread over the cornea, other means muſt be uſed. When the diſeaſed part is only ſlightly attached, it may be freely removed by a cut of the knife ; but when this cannot be done without difficulty, it is better to deſtroy the veſſels by the extenſion of which this ſubſtance is chiefly formed. The manner of performing the operation in general is this : The patient being properly ſeated, the eyelids opened, and the eye ſecured, the operator, with a ſmall knife, makes a ſcariſication through the whole thickness of the excreſcence, entirely round, and at a little diſtance from the circumference, by which the ſource of nouriſhment will be cut off ; and, after the blooding is abated, one or two inciſions more may be made, in a ſimilar manner, within the former. Some practitioners raiſe the excreſcence with a needle and ligature before the inciſion is made; and, in ſome caſes, this may be done with advantage, though not in others.</p><p>After the bleeding is over, the part is to be bathed two or three times a-day with a weak ſaturnine ſolution ; and the operation may be repeated occaſionally till the excreſcence is removed. In this way the operation commonly proves effectual ; but inſtances ſometimes occur where, inſtead of being uſeful, it increaſes the diſeaſe. Whenever this happens, a palliative courſe is the only thing to be tried ; and although it will not remove the diſorder, it may commonly prevent the excreſcence from acquiring any additional ſize. With this intention it ought to be frequently bathed with the ſolution laſt mentioned, and afterwards covered with a cooling ointment. When the diſorder cannot even be palliated, when viſion is deſtroyed, and particularly when the pain attending it is ſevere, there is reaſon to ſuſpect cancer. In this caſe the eye ought to be extirpated, otherwiſe deeper parts may ſuffer, and the life of the patient be endangered. The method of performing this operation will be afterwards pointed out.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV. <hi rend="italic">Of Abscesses in the Globe of the Eye.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Though</hi> inflammation of the eye generally terminates by reſolution, inſtances ſometimes occur in which an absceſs ensues. This is owing either to improper treatment, or a bad habit of body which counteracts all remedies. The greateſt danger attending theſe complaints is when they are ſituated on the cornea, as the cicatrix left by them may deſtroy viſion. When deep ſeated, a purulent matter is sometimes apt to be found in ſome of the chambers of the eye, the ball becomes enlarged, the humours are diſturbed, and neither the iris, pupil, nor lens can be diſtinguiſhed. In ſome rare caſes again, after theſe appearances have continued ſome time, the cornea burſts, part or whole of the humours are evacuated, and the iris protrudes in a thickened diſtended ſtate. This has now the appearance of an excreſcence, which is called st <hi rend="italic">aphyloma</hi> from a kind of relemblance to a grape. But under this term ſome authors include all collections like thoſe above deſcribed. In moſt inſtances the cornea protrudes, but in others the tunica ſclerotica or opaque part is affected with partial ſwellings or protruſions.</p><p>While the diſeaſe is forming, beſides the loss of ſight, the patient commonly feels great diſtreſs in the eye and head, accompanied by symptoms of fever. When no other diſtreſs is experienced than the loſs of ſight, the ſwelling is but ſmall, and contains chiefly a watery fluid. In the treatment, as viſion is ſeldom preſerved, the principal thing is to abate the pain and remove deformity. There is another kind of absceſs in the eye, termed <hi rend="italic">hypopyon,</hi> where the matter is lodged in the ſubſtance of the coats. It is ſometimes produced by external injuries, but more frequently from pullules of small-pox. If this termination cannot be prevented by the remedies mentioned in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Medicine,</hi> n⁰ 175, the matter muſt be evacuated by an inciſion into the eye, not regarding the humours, as viſion previous to this time is entirely deſtroyed. The proper part is the cornea or the moſt prominent part of the tumor.</p><p>A variety of this diſorder ſometimes, though rarely, happens, where the humours are abſorbed ; but ſtill the ſame external appearances are obſerved. In this caſe the tumor is formed by a thickening of the coats, eſpecially the iris. The only means of relief is extirpation of the prominent part by the uſe of the knife. After the contents of the eye have been diſcharged, the parts are to be covered with a compreſs moiſtened with a ſaturnine ſolution, and the antiphlogiſtic courſe followed, till a cure is perfected, or ax leaſt inflammation removed. If the ulcers discharge a thin acrid matter, they may be waſhed two or three times a day with a ſolution of corroſive ſublimate, or of white vitriol, &amp;c. Fungous excreſcences, ſometimes conſidered as a cancer of the eye, are apt to form in both theſe diſeaſes after the matter is evacuated ; but they may be prevented from in-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0141.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0135"/>
creasing to a conſiderable ſize by burnt alum finely powdered, or by touching them occaſionally with lunar cauſtic.</p><p>Ulcers on the eye may ariſe from the same cauſes which produce ulcers on other parts of the body, as wounds, burns, &amp;c ; or they may ariſe from a general affection of the conſtitution, as lues or ſcrophula ; but they are more immediately produced by inflammation. In the treatment therefore of ſuch diſeaſes, blood-letting, bliſtering, laxative and cooling applications, as already deſcribed in the caſe of ophthalmia, are to be employed. When the inflammatory ſtate is removed, their management muſt be almoſt the ſame with that for ſimilar affections in other parts of the body. When the diſorder ariſes from an affection of the ſyſtem, the primary diſeaſe muſt be attended to before a cure can be performed. With reſpect to the sores themſelves, if acrid matter be diſeharged, we muſt have recourſe to determent ointments and waſhes before a cicatrix can be formed. When theſe have not the deſired effect, and when the ſore becomes ſoft and higher than the reſt of the eye, aſtringent applications are moſt efficacious. If excrescences be preſent, theſe are to be removed by eſcharotics, or by the knife. In ſome rare inſtances excreſcences of a fungous nature are found to be connected with the interior parts of the eye, and become ſo prominent as even to reſt upon the cheek. When ſuch occur, nothing but the removal of the eye itſelf can effect a cure.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V. <hi rend="italic">Of Dropſical Swellings of the Eye.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> eye is ſometimes enlarged by an accumulation of the aqueous humour. The ſymptoms are, a ſenſe of fullneſs in the eyeball ; by degrees the motions of the eyelids become impeded; viſion gradually becomes more and more imperfect, till at laſt the patient can only diſtinguish light from darkness. As the diſeaſe increaſes, the ball of the eye becomes greatly enlarged, and at this time the cornea begins to protrude ; when, if a puncture be not made, the eye burſts and empties itſelf. This diſeaſe is apt to be confounded with ſtaphyloma. But in the dropſical ſwelling the patient is always ſenſible to the effects of light, and the pupil is obſerved to contract, which does not happen in ſtaphyloma. In the early stages of this diſeaſe viſion may be preſerved by puncturing the under edge of the cornea, and allowing the aqueous humour to paſs out by the anterior chamber ; or by puncturing the tunica ſclerotica a little behind the iris, by which the fluid will paſs out by the poſterior chamber. The puncture may be made either with a lancet, pointed knife, or with a very ſmall flat trocar. The eye ought afterwards to be dressed with a compreſs made moiſt with a ſaturnine ſolution, guarding againſt excessive inflammation. When the uſe of the eye is ſomewhat recovered, tone may be reſtored to the parts, and a return of the diſeaſe as much as poſſible prevented, by frequently bathing the eye in aſtringent lotions ; but where the cornea is deſtroyed, the ſight cannot be reſtored : We can then only diminiſh the ſize of the eye, and render it ſomewhat more comfortable to the patient.</p><p>Blood may be effuſed into the chambers of the eye from various cauſes, as in putrid diſeaſes, or in conſequence of inflammation, but moſt frequently from a rupture of the blood-veſſels induced by external injury. In whatever way it gets into the eye, it mixes with the aqueous humour, and renders it opaque. It is ſometimes taken up by the abſorbents ; when it is otherwiſe, it ought to be diſcharged by a puncture.</p><p>A few inſtances have occurred where the blood has fallen to the under ſide of the eye, and remained there without mixing with the aqueous humour. In ſuch a ſituation it ought to be allowed to remain.</p><p>When a puncture is necessary, it is to be made in the ſame manner as in caſes of dropſy of the eye ; only the opening may require to be ſomewhat larger, otherwiſe the blood may not paſs readily out. After the operation, nothing is neceſſary but to apply a compreſs of soft lint, moiſtened with a weak ſaturnine ſolution.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VI. <hi rend="italic">Of the Prοtrusion of the Eyeball beyond its Socket.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> eye may protrude in conſequence of external violence, or from tumors forming behind it, or on account of ſome of the ulcers, excreſcences, or dropſical ſwellings, already mentioned. When the eye is forced out of its ſocket by external violence, if the eyeball be not entirely ſeparated from the neighbouring parts, it ought to be freed from any extraneous matter which may adhere to it, and immediately replaced; and if the optic nerve be not quite divided, the uſe of the eye may be recovered. With a view to prevent or moderate inflammation, every part of the antiphlogiſtic regimen ought to be ſtrictly adhered to. If the protrusion is occaſioned by a tumor, the cure muſt depend upon the removal of this ; and if the diſeaſe has advanced so far that the bones are become carious, they muſt likewiſe be ſeparated. But more frequently, inſtead of the bones becoming carious, they aſſume a gelatinous or rather cartilaginous nature. In ſuch a ſituation an operation could be of little advantage. The beſt method to prevent the bones from being ſo affected is an early performance of the operation.</p><p>A few inſtances have happened of the eye being puſhed from its locket by an enlargement of the lachrymal gland. When this occurs, if the enlargement be conſiderable, the ſtructure of the eye will moſt probably be ſo much injured that viſion will be deſtroyed ; but inſtances have occurred of this gland, in the enlarged ſtate, having been removed without any injury being done to the eye.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VII. Of <hi rend="italic">Cancer of the Eye, and Extirpation of the Eyeball.</hi></p><p>S <hi rend="smallcaps">cirrhus</hi> and cancer may ariſe from repeated inflammations of the eye, or from ſtaphyloma, or ſome of the other diſeaſes which frequently attack this organ. The ſymptoms are, an enlargement, hardness, and protruſion of the ball, with a red, fungous appearance, ſometimes diſcharging thick, yellow matter, but more frequently a thin acrid ichor. At firſt there is only a ſenſation of heat in the tumor ; but this gradually increasing, changes at laſt into darting pains, which likewiſe ſhoot through to the oppoſite ſide of the head. In this ſituation blood-letting, opiates, and emollient applications, may alleviate the pain. A hemlock poultice applied to the eye, and a waſh of limewater, with a little opium diſſolved in it, and applied every time the poultice is renewed, gives ſome relief ; but altho' the pain be moderated by theſe means, it does not prevent the diſeaſe from ſpreading, nor can any thing elſe but extirpation produce a radical cure.</p><p>After the diſeaſe is diſcovered to be cancerous, the operation ſhould be performed without delay, to prevent the parts in the neighbourhood, as well as the conſtitution at large, from ſuffering. In performing the operation, the patient ſhould be placed in a proper light, and the head ſupported by an aſſiſtant. If the eyelids are diſeaſed, they muſt be ſeparated along with the tumor ; but where they are ſound, they ought to be carefully preſerved ; and for this purpoſe they may be kept out of the way by two levators held by aſſiſtants. When the eyeball protrudes conſiderably, the operator may lay hold of it with his fingers; but if this be impracticable, a broad ligature ſhould be introduced through the centre of it, that it may be the more<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0142.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0136"/>
readily removed from the orbit. Sometimes it will be neceſſary to enlarge the opening of the eyelids, by cutting the external angle to allow the eyeball to be more readily removed. The whole of the diſeaſed parts are now to be ſeparated by a knife bent ſo as to correſpond with the ſides of the orbit, guarding at the ſame time againſt wounding the perioſteum or the bones of the orbit, which are commonly extremely thin. The eye being in this manner extirpated, the hemorrhagy from the ocular arteries is to be ſuppreſſed by means of agaric, or by a bit of ſponge ; then over this is to be laid ſoft lint, with a napkin to cover the whole. After ſuppuration takes place, the dreſſings are to be removed, when a little lint, applied with an emollient pledget over it, will be ſufficient as long as any matter is discharged. After the wound is healed, the deformity may be in ſome measure obviated by wearing an artificial eye; though it is chiefly in caſes where part of the humours of the eye have been evacuated that this can be uſed with much propriety ; for when the orbit is empty the artificial eye sinks too far into it.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VIII. <hi rend="italic">Of the Cataract.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> ancients, and ſome of the modern writers, had a confuſed idea of the ſeat of the cataract ; different authors placing it in different parts of the eye. It conſiſts of an affection of the cryſtalline lens or of its capſule, by which the rays of light are prevented from falling upon the retina ; and is therefore the ſame diſeaſe with the glaucoma of the ancients. It commonly begins with a dimneſs of fight ; and this generally continues a conſiderable time before any opacity can be obſerved in the lens. As the diſeaſe advances the opacity becomes ſenſible, and the patient imagines there are particles of duſt or motes upon the eye, or in the air. This opacity gradually increaſes till the perſon either becomes entirely blind, or can merely diſtinguiſh light from darkneſs. The diſeaſe commonly comes on rapidly, though fometimes its progreſs is slow and gradual. The opacity of the lens is found to be nearly in proportion to the degree of blindneſs the patient is affected with ; it gradually changes from a ſtate of tranſparency to a perfectly white, or light grey colour. In ſome very rare inſtances a black cataract is found. Sometimes the diſeaſe is confined to a particular ſpot of the lens, but generally the whole is affected. The conſiſtence alſo varies, being at one time hard, at another entirely diſſolved. When the eye is otherwiſe found, the pupil moves according to the degree of light in which it is placed. This diſeaſe is ſeldom attended with pain ; ſometimes, however, every expoſure to light creates uneasineſs, owing probably to inflammation in the bottom of the eye. The real cauſe of cataract is not yet well understood. Numbers of authors conſider it as proceeding from a preternatural contraction of the vessels of the lens, ariſing ſometimes from external violence, though more commonly from ſome internal and occult cauſe. The diſeaſe is diſtinguiſhed from the gutta ſerena, by the pupils in the latter being never affected with light, and from no opacity being obſerved in the lens. It is diſtinguiſhed from hypopyon, ſtaphyloma, or any other diſeaſe in the fore part of the eye, by the evident marks which theſe affections produce, as well as by the pain attending their beginning. But it is difficult to determine when the opacity is in the lens or in its capſule. The lens is generally affected ; when the capſule is the ſeat of the diſeaſe, it is termed the membranous cataract.</p><p>With reſpect to the treatment : If the diſeaſe be in the incipient ſtate, mercury, particularly calomel in ſmall doſes, has been attended with ſome advantage. When any degree of inflammation is preſent, blood-letting and cooling regimen will ſometimes be neceſſary. Electricity, extract, hyoſcyami, flammula Jovis, &amp;c. have likewiſe been extolled ; but after theſe or other remedies have failed, the cure muſt depend upon a chirurgical operation. For this purpoſe two methods are in general uſe. The firſt of theſe, and which was practiſed for a long time before the other, is called <hi rend="italic">couching.</hi> It is done with a view to allow the rays of light to fall upon the retina ; and it conſiſts in removing the lens from its capſule, and lodging it in ſome part of the vitreous humour, where it may be entirely off the axis of the eye, and where it is ſuppoſed, in courſe of time, to dissolve.</p><p>The other method is termed <hi rend="italic">extraction,</hi> where, after an inciſion has been made in the cornea, the lens is puſhed through the pupil, and then entirely removed from the eye. Each of theſe methods has been much practiſed, and it is ſtill a matter of doubt to which we ought to give the preference. The next circumſtance deſerving attention is the time at which the operation for couching or extracting can with moſt propriety be performed. Formerly it was thought neceſſary to wait till the lens had a certain degree of conſiſtence, or was become ripe; but no certain marks of fluidity or firmneſs have been yet diſcovered; neither indeed is there any neceſſity for attending particularly to it, as the operation may be practiſed in every period of the diſeaſe, providing the retina be ſound, the iris have the power of contracting, and the cornea be tranſparent. The proper time for the operation is when the opacity of the lens is ſo conſiderable as to prevent the patient from following his ordinary occupation. When this is not the caſe, or when the patient has the uſe of one eye, it ought not to be performed, as it is always attended with ſome degree of danger.</p><p>When the operation is to be performed, the following is the method of doing it : And firſt, <hi rend="italic">of couching the catarad.</hi> To guard as much as poſſible againſt the effects of inflammation, the patient ſhould be confined, for ſeveral days previous to the operation, to a low regimen ; and two or three doſes of ſome cooling laxative ſhould be given at proper intervals. After this he is to be ſeated with his face towards the light ; but ſunſhine ought to be avoided. Some, however, prefer a ſide-light both on account of the operator and patient. One aſſiſtant is to ſupport the head, while others ſecure the arms. The operator is either to be ſeated with his elbow reſting upon a table; or, which is preferred by ſome, he ought to ſtand, reſting his arm upon the side of the patient. The eye being fixed by the ſpeculum (fig. 29.), or in ſuch a manner as to allow the whole of the cornea and a ſmall portion oſ the ſclerotic coat to protrude, a couching needle (fig. 31.) is to be held in the right hand, in the manner of a writing pen, if the left eye be the ſubject of operation ; the ring and little fingers are to be ſupported upon the cheek or temple of the patient : The needle is to be entered in an horizontal direction through the ſclerotic coat, a little below the axis of the eye, and about one fourth of a line behind the edge of the cornea, ſo as to get entirely behind the iris. If the needle be of the flat form, the flat ſide ought to be oppoſed to the iris, to prevent that ſubſtance from being wounded. The point of the needle is to be carried forwards till it be diſcovered behind the pupil. The operator is now commonly directed to puſh the point into the lens, and depreſs it at once to the bottom of the eye ; but in this way the lens either burſts through the capſule at an improper place, or it carries the capſule with it, tearing it from the parts to which it is connected. Inſtead of this, the needle ought firſt to be puſhed into the lens near its under edge, as Dr Taylor adviſes, and then carried ſome way down into the vitreous humour, ſo as to clear the way for the lens. It is then to be drawn a little back, and carried to the upper<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0143.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0137"/>
part of the capſule, when, by preſſing upon it, the lens, if ſolid, is to be puſhed down by one, or, if fluid, by ſeveral movements, to the bottom of the vitreous humour. It ſhould then be puſhed downwards and outwards, as Mr Bell directs, ſo as to leave it in the under and outer ſide of the eye ; where, in caſe it ſhould riſe, the passage or the light would be little obſtructed. The needle is then to be withdrawn, the ſpeculum removed, and the eyelids cloſed ; and a compreſs ſoaked in a ſaturnine ſolution is to be applied over them. Mr Pellier’s method is to cover each eye with a linen bag half filled with fine wool, applied dry and fixed to a circular bandage of linen paſſed round the forehead : the whole is retained by a triangular napkin. The patient is them to be laid in bed, upon his back, with his head very little trailed; and to be kept in this ſituation for abouta week in a dark room. Unleſs he be of a weakly habit, he ought to be bled at the neck, or leeched at the temple, a few hours after the operation. He ſhould be kept upon low diet, and get ſmall doſes of opiates frequently repeated. His belly ſhould be kept moderately open by gentle puratives. The dreſſings ſhould not be removed till inflammation is at leaſt ſo far gone that no danger will ariſe from uncovering the eye, which may generally be about the eighth or tenth day. Sometimes the patient perceives light immediately on the dreſſings being removed, but more frequently not till ſome time after.</p><p>Upon removing the dreſſings, if the cataract has again got back to the axis of the eye, a repetition of the operation may become neceſſary. Some time, however, after the inflammatory ſymptoms are gone, ſhould be allowed to elapſe before any other operation is again attempted ; for the cataract frequently dissolves, providing the aqueous humour get free acceſs to it. Mr Pott ſometimes, when he found the cataract to be of the mixed kind, did not attempt depreſſion, but contented himſelf with a free laceration of the capſule ; in which caſes the lens hardly ever failed of diſsolving ſo entirely as not to leave the ſmalleſt veſtige of a cataract. When the operation is to be performed upon the right eye, the ſtraight needle muſt either be uſed by the left hand, or the operator muſt place himſelf behind the patient. A needle (fig. 32.) has been contrived, however, with a large curve, by which the operation may be readily performed with the right hand, while the ſurgeon is placed before the patient ; only the needle is entered towards the inner, inſtead of the outer, angle of the eye.</p><p>The firſt hint of extracting the lens ſeems to have been ſuggeſted by Mr Petit, who propoſed to open the cornea and extract the lens when it was forced into the anterior chamber of the eye either by external violence or accidentally in couching. At firſt it was conſidered as a dangerous operation, and was ſeldom practiſed till about the year 1737, when Mr David propoſed and practiſed extraction in preference to couching. The operation is now performed iin the following manner : The patient and operator being placed, and the eye fixed in the ſame manner as for couching, the ſpeculum, when the operation is to be done upon the left eye, is to be held in the left hand of the operator. It is neceſſary to make as much preſſure as will ſecure without hurting the eye. Neither ought the cornea to be preſſed too near the iris, lest the latter be wounded. The operator now takes the knife (fig. 33.), and holds it in the ſame way as he does the needle for couching ; he then enters the point of it with the edge undermoſt into the cornea about the diſtance of half a line from its connection with the ſclerotic coat, and as high as the centre of the pupil ; he is then to paſs it acroſs the pupil to the inner angle in an horizontal direction, keeping the edge a little outwards to prevent the iris from being cut ; the point is then to be puſhed through oppoſite to where it entered ; the under half of the cornea is next to be cut, and at the ſame diſtance from the ſclerotics with the parts at which the point of the knife went into and came out from the eye.</p><p>In cutting the under half of the cornea the preſſure of the ſpeculum upon the eye ſhould be gradually leſſened ; for if the eye be too much compreſſed, the aqueous humour, with the cataract and part of the vitreous humour, are apt to be forced ſuddenly out immediately after the inciſion is made. The operator then takes a flat probe, and raiſes the flap made in the cornea, while he passes the ſame inſtrument, or another probe (fig. 34.), rough at the extremity, cautiouſly through the pupil, to ſcratch an opening in the capſule of the lens. This being done, the eye ſhould be ſhaded till the lens be extracted, or the eyelids are to be ſhut to allow the pupil to be dilated as much as possible ; and while in this ſituation, if a gentle preſſure be made upon the eyeball at either the upper or under edge of the orbit, the cataract will paſs through the pupil more readily than it would do when the eyelids are open.</p><p>It the lens cannot be eaſily puſhed through the opening of the cornea, no violent force ſhould be uſed, for this would tend much to increaſe the inflammation. The opening ſhould be enlarged, ſo as to allow the lens to paſs out more freely. When the cataract does not come out entire, or when it is found to adhere to the contiguous parts, the end of a ſmall flat probe, or a ſcoop (fig. 35.), is to be introduced, to remove any detached pieces or adheſions that may be preſent. The iris ſometimes either projects too much into the anterior chamber, or is puſhed out through the opening of the cornea. When this happens, it is to be returned to its natural ſituation by means of the probe already mentioned. Sometimes the opacity is not in the body of the lens, but entirely in the capſule which contains it. The extraction of the lens alone would here anſwer no uſeful purpoſe. Some practitioners attempt to extract, firſt the lens, and then the capſule by forceps ; others, the lens and capſule entire. Thoſe who have had much practice in this branch of ſurgery, as Pellier, ſay they find ſuch a method practicable ; but others think it better to truſt entirely to time and a cooling regimen ſor the cure, which, in ſome inſtances, has taken place. When the operation is to be performed on the right eye, the operator is either to uſe the left hand, to take his ſtation behind the patient, or to employ a crooked knife (fig. 36.)</p><p>After the operation is finiſhed, the eyelids are to be ſhut, and the ſame treatment obſerved as in couching. When the operation ſucceeds, the wound in the cornea is generally healed in little more than eight or ten days ; but previous to this time, the eye ought not to be examined ; and even then it ſhould only be done in a dull light, otherwiſe it may ſuffer conſiderably from the irritation which a ſtrong light might occaſion. When the eye is to be examined, if the eyelids be found adhering together, they ought to be waſhed with ſome gentle aſtringent. With this the eye ought alſo to be frequently washed afterwards, by which it will gradually recover ſtrength and ſight. About the end of the third week the dreſſing may be entirely removed, and a piece of green ſilk put over the eyes as a ſhade ; and if every thing has ſucceeded, the patient may generally go out after a month from the time at which the operation was performed.</p><p>It ſometimes happens, that in extracting the lens a portion of the vitreous humour is evacuated. This does not in general prevent the ſucceſs of the operation. The eye ſoon begins to fill again, and in the course of two or three<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0144.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0138"/>
weeks it is for the moſt part as large as it was previous to the operation. Whether this be owing to a renewal of the vitreous humour, or merely an aqueous ſecretion, is not yet determined ; though the latter circumſtance is generally suppoſed.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap</hi>. XIV. <hi rend="italic">Of Fistula. Lachrymalis.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">By</hi> this diſeaſe is properly underſtood a ſinuous ulcer of the lachrymal ſac or duct with callous edges, though every obſtruction of this paſſage is commonly called <hi rend="italic">fistula lachrymalis.</hi></p><p>The firſt and moſt simple ſtate of the diſeaſe is that termed a <hi rend="italic">dropsy of the lachrymal sac.</hi> The ſymptoms are, a tumor between the inner cornea of the eye and ſide of the noſe. This diſappears by preſſure, the tears mixed with mucus paſſing partly into the noſe, but chiefly back upon the eye and over the cheek.</p><p>This ſtate of the diſeaſe is what the French have called the hernia, or <hi rend="italic">hydrops sacculi lachrymalis.</hi> It is frequently met with in children who have been rickety, or are ſubject to glandular obſtructions : and in this ſtate it ſometimes remains for ſeveral years, ſubject to little alterations, as the health or habit ſhall happen to vary, the ſacculus being ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs full and troubleſome ; the contents which are preſſed out are ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs cloudy ; and now and then the diſeaſe is attended with a flight ophthalmy, or an inflammation of the eyelids, but which, by common care, is eaſily removed. It the ſacculus be not much dilated, the diſcharge ſmall, and produced only by preſſure, the chief inconveniences are the weeping eye, and the gumming together of the lids after ſleeping : but theſe, by being attended to, may be kept from being very troubleſome ; and if the diſeaſe makes no further progreſs, may be ſo regulated as to render any more painful proceſs totally unnecessary. If the dilatation be conſiderable, the ſwelling is more viſible, and the quantity of fluid is larger ; it is alſo in this ſtate more frequently mixed and cloudy, and more troubleſome, from the more frequent neceſſity of emptying the bag ; but if the patient be an adult, it may, even in this more dilated ſtate of it, be kept from being very inconvenient.</p><p>If an inflammation comes on, the tumor is thereby conſiderably increaſed, the diſcharge is larger, as well during ſleep as upon preſſure ; the ſkin covering it loses its natural whiteneſs and ſoftneſs, becomes hard, and acquires an inflamed redneſs ; and with the tears a mixture of ſomething, which in colour reſembles matter, is discharged, eſpecially if the preſſure be made with any force, or continued for any time.</p><p>When the parts are in this ſtate, the contents of the bag have ſo much the appearance of purulent matter, that they are now generally conſidered as ſuch, though Mr Pott and ſeveral others have been of a different opinion, conſidering the fluid as merely mucus under a different form ; allowing, however, that pus is ſometimes discharged. If the puncta lachrymalia be naturally large and open, and the inflammation confined to the ſurface of the ſac, its contents will paſs off pretty freely, and the ſkin will remain entire.</p><p>But when the ſkin covering the lachrymal bag has been for ſome time inflamed, or ſubject to frequently returning inflammations, it moſt commonly happens that the puncta lachrymalia are affected by it, and the fluid, not having an opportunity of paſſing off through them, diſtends the inflamed ſkin ; ſo that at laſt it becomes ſloughy, burſts externally, and forms an opening in the moſt prominent part of the tumor, at which the tears and matter contained in it are discharged. When the opening thus formed is ſmall, it commonly heals again in a few days, but it burſts as ſoon as a conſiderable quantity of this fluid is collected ; and it continues thus to collect and burſt alternately, till the opening becomes ſufficiently large to prevent any farther collection. This ſtate of the diſorder exhibits exactly the appearances of a ſinuous ulcer, with callous, and ſometimes with retorted edges ; and this ſtage forms properly the real fiſtula lachrynalis. Tears, mucus, and purulent matter, are now abundantly diſcharged from the ſore. When the bone beneath is ſound, this diſcharge is ſeldom either acrid or offensive to the smell, for the opening being in general in the under part of the tumor, the matter is readily evacuated ; but when any of the contiguous bones are carious, they are not only found to be ſo by the introduction of a probe, but by the appearance, ſmell, and effects of the matter upon the neighbouring parts. In this caſe it is thin, fetid, and commonly ſo acrid as to fret and corrode the integuments moſt contiguous to the ulcer ; and when the diſorder is connected with ſcrophula or with lues venerea, which is by no means an unfrequent occurrence, the diſcharge and appearance of the ſore will vary according as it happens to be combined with one or other of theſe diſeaſes.</p><p>From what has been ſaid, we may divide this diſeaſe into four general heads or ſtates, under which all its more minute diſtinctions may be comprehended. The firſt conſiſts in a simple dilatation of the ſacculus and obſtruction of the naſal duct, discharging, upon preſsure, a fluid either quite clear or a little cloudy ; the ſkin covering the bag being entire and perfectly free from inflammation. In the second, the tumor is ſomewhat larger ; the ſkin which covers it is in an inflamed ſtate, but entire ; and the diſcharge made through the puncta lachrymalia is of a pale yellow or purulent colour. In the third, the ſkin covering the ſacculus is become ſloughy, and burſts ; by which means the ſwelling is in ſome meaſure leſſened : but the matter which, while the ſkin was entire, uſed to be preſſed out through the puncta lachrymalia, now diſcharges itſelf through the new aperture. The ductus ad nares, both in this and the preceding ſtate, are not otherwiſe diſeaſed than by the thickening of its lining. In the fourth, the paſſage from the ſacculus lachrymalis into the noſe is totally obliterated, the inside of the former being either ulcerated or filled up with a fungus, and attended sometimes with a caries of the bone underneath.</p><p>In the firſt and moſt simple ſtate of the diſeaſe, viz. that of mere obſtruction without inflammation, much pains have been taken to reſtore the parts to their natural ſtate and uſe, without making any wound or diviſion at all. The introduction of a probe, the injection of aſtringent fluids, and a conſtant compreſſion made on the outſide of the ſacculus in the corner of the eye, are the principal means by which this has been attempted.</p><p>Several years ago, M. Anel made a probe (fig. 37.) of ſo ſmall a ſize as to be capable of paſſing from the eyelid into the noſe, being introduced at one of the punctalachrymalia, and paſſing through the ſacculus and duct ; with which probe he propoſed to break through any ſmall obſtruction which might be found in its paſſage. He alſo invented a ſyringe (fig. 38.), the pipe of which is ſmall enough to enter one of the puncta, and thus furniſhes an opportunity of injecting a liquor into the ſacculus and duct ; and with theſe two inſtruments he pretended to be able to cure the diſeaſe whenever it conſiſted in obſtruction merely, and the diſcharge was not much discoloured. The firſt of theſe, viz. the paſſage of a ſmall probe through the puncta, has a plauſible appearance ; but will, upon trial, be found very unequal to the talk aſſigned : the very ſmall ſize of it, its neceſſary flexibility, and the very little resistance it is capable of making, are manifeſt deficiencies in the inſtru-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0145.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0139"/>
ment ; the quick ſenſation in the lining of the ſac and duct, and its diſeaſed ſtate, are great objections on the ſide of the parts, ſuppoſing it were capable of anſwering any valuable end, which it moſt certainly is not.</p><p>That the paſſing a fine probe from one of the puncta lachrymalia into the noſe is very practicable, is known from experience ; but the pain it gives, and the inflammation it often excites, are much greater than any benefit which does or can ariſe from it. It is ſaid that the principal uſe of this probe is to clear the little ducts leading from the puncta into the ſacculus, and the obſtruction of thoſe ducts is often mentioned as a part of this diſeaſe. Hence one would be led to ſuppoſe that it was a circumſtance which frequently occurred ; whereas it is ſeldom, if ever, met with. Nor, even if it did happen, could it ever produce the diſeaſe in queſtion; the principal characteriſtic of which is a diſcharge into the inner corner of the eye upon preſſure made in the angle.</p><p>The ſyringe, if uſed judiciouſly while the diſeaſe is recent, the ſac very little dilated, and the mucus perfectly clear, will ſometimes be found ſerviceable ; it gives no pain; and a few trials render the uſe of it by no means troubleſome. There is very little occasion, however, to take much trouble, or to put the patient to ſo much uneaſineſs ; for if the ſac be emptied by compreſſion, if the liquor which was to have been injected be applied to the puncta, they will abſorb it as readily as the fluid which naturally paſses through them.</p><p>Fabricius ab Aquapendente invented an inſtrument, which was ſo contrived as by means of a ſcrew to make a preſſure externally on the lachrymal bag ; from the uſe of which, he ſays, his patients received much benefit. This inſtrument has been conſiderably improved by late practitioners, and is ſtill recommended as very uſeful. See fig. 39.</p><p>All the good that can be obtained by compreſs and bandage, this ſcrew is capable of procuring ; but it is alſo ſubject to all the ſame inconveniences, ariſing from the impoſſibility of determining exactly the due degree of preſſure: for if it be ſo great as to bring the sides of the upper part of the ſac into contact, all communication between it and the puncta will be thereby flopped; if it be but slight, the accumulation will not be prevented ; nor does it in either caſe contribute to the removal of the obſtruction in the naſal duct, the primary and original cauſe of the diſeaſe. If the curative intention was to procure an union of the ſides of the ſacculus, as in the caſe of parts ſeparated from each other by the formation of matter or ſloughs, and the preſſure could be made uniformly and conſtantly, poſſibly it might be ſo managed as to answer a valuable purpoſe ; but as that is not the intention, the preſſure, whether made by an inſtrument or by a common roller and compreſs, contributes little or nothing toward a cure.</p><p>When the diſeaſe is only beginning to form, if the lachrymal ſac be frequently preſſed with the finger, the contents of it will be discharged before they become acrid, and the complaint, though ſeldom to be cured in this manner, may be ſometimes endured without any other aſſiſtance. But when the diſeaſe has advanced ſo far as to be in a ſtate of inflammation, conſiderable relief may be obtained from ſuch remedies as are found to be uſeful in inflammatory affections of other parts of the body, as blood-letting, laxatives, and low diet, together with ſaturnine applications to the parts affected. But when theſe fail, and it is found that the paſſage of the tears to the noſe is completely obſtructed, as the matter, if it does not burſt outwardly, may be in danger of corroding the bone underneath, a different practice is to be followed.</p><p>In this ſtate, an opening in the upper part of the sacculus lachrymalis becomes in general abſolutely neceſſary; and as wound made by a knife leaves a much leſs diſagreeable ſcar than that which neceſſarily follows the burſting of the skin, one being a mere simple diviſion, the other a loſe of ſubtance ; it will always be found beſt to anticipate the accident of burſting, by making the opening as ſoon as the integuments are in ſuch a ſtate as to threaten it.</p><p>For making this inciſion, authors have been very particular in their directions with regard to its place, manner, and form. But all that the ſurgeon need obſerve is, to take care to keep the knife at a proper diſtance from the juncture of the palpebræ, to begin the inciſion a very little above a line drawn from that juncture toward the noſe, and to continue it downward ſo as to lay the ſac completely open ; and the beſt inſtrument to make it with is a ſcalpel of the common form, but of a ſmall ſize. If the ſacculus be already burſt, the place of opening is determined ; and the orifice may be enlarged with a knife, or dilated.</p><p>The inciſion being made, the contents of the tumor ſhould be moderately preſſed out ; after which, ſome practitioners advise that the naſal duct ſhould be ſearched for by means of a probe ; and if found, that a piece of catgut, bougie, or lead, ſhould be introduced, and kept there, its edge being bent a little downwards till the ſides of the duct are ſkinned over and healed. In the mean time, the ſore is to be dressed with ſimple pledgets of wax and oil, which are to be retained by means of adheſive plaſter. As ſoon as the paſſage of the tears into the noſe is ſufficiently ſecured, the ſubſtance which has been leſt in it is to be withdrawn, and the wound healed.</p><p>The laſt ſtate of this diſorder is that in which the natural paſſage from the ſacculus to the noſe is ſo diſeaſed as to be quite obliterated, or in which the bones are ſometimes found to be carious. The methods hitherto deſcribed have all been calculated to preſerve the natural paſſage, and to drive the lachrymal fluid again through it. In this attempt they are ſometimes ſucceſsful ; but when every trial for diſcovering the naſal duct has been unſucceſsful, recourſe muſt be had to an artificial opening for the tears. In performing this part of the operation, the patient ſhould be ſeated oppoſite to a window, with his head ſupported by an aſſiſtant. The ſurgeon is to place himſelf immediately before him, either in a fitting or ſtanding poſture. The canula of the trocar (fig. 40⁰.) is now to be introduced to the under and back part of the lachrymal ſac, and held with one hand, while the ſtilette is to be paſſed into it by the other, in a direction obliquely downwards and inwards, between the two ſpongy bones, till it reach the cavity of the noſe, which will be known by ſome bloody mucus paſſing out at the noſtril. As ſoon as the inſtrument has penetrated the noſe, the opening ſhould be made ſufficiently large ; then the ſtilette ſhould be withdrawn, and a bit of catgut or bougie, or what is more cleanly and convenient, a leaden probe, is to be introduced, and the canula removed. One end of the probe ought to remain in the noſe, and the other bent in ſuch a way as to hang over the edge of the wound, and at the ſame time be in no danger of coming out. The ſore is now to be covered with a pledget of lint ſpread with emollient ointment, and the whole retained with adheſive plaſter. The probe muſt be removed every day or two, ſo as to allow it and the paſſage to be cleaned ; and at each dreſſing ſome aſtringent injection ſhould be thrown in, when the parts are to be dressed as at firſt. Several weeks will commonly be neceſſary for rendering the paſſage perfectly callous ; but this muſt depend much upon the ſtate of the parts, as well as the conſtitution of the patient.</p><p>After the paſſage is become ſufficiently callous, the dreſſings and probe are to be withdrawn, and the parts cleared from any mucus with which they may be stuffed. The<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0146.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0140"/>
ſides of the wound, now already ſufficiently contracted, are to be laid together, and covered with ſome adheſive plaſter. If this be ineffectual, the wound is to be touched with cauſtic, when the cure will generally be quickly completed. To give tone to the parts, moderate preſſure ſhould frequently be made upon the ſac, either by the patient’s finger or by the machine already mentioned, and this ſhould be continued for a conſiderable time. Sometimes the diſeaſe returns after a cure has been made, owing to diſeaſes of the conſtitution, carious bone contiguous to the ſore, or ſometimes to too ſmall an opening having been formed. In this caſe a canula of gold, fiber, or lead, is ſometimes introduced into the artificial paſſage, and the ſkin healed over it ; by which means the paſſage will afterwards remain completely open, and no diſeaſe of the conſtitution can ever affect it. We ſhall deſcribe Mr Pellſer’s method of performing this operation, who has made ſeveral improvements on it.</p><p>The patient is to be ſeated, and his head properly ſupported by an aſſiſtant; then the ſac is to be laid freely open at its inferior part; the naſal duct is to be ſearched for with a firm probe, or with a conductor (fig. 41.) made for the purpoſe ; and Pellier aſſerts that he never fails in finding it. As ſoon as this is diſcovered, a conical tube (fig. 42.), with a projection at the top, and another in the middle for ſecuring it in its place, muſt be put upon the conductor, previouſly furniſhed with a compreſſor (fig. 43.), and it ſhould be of ſuch a ſize that the conductor may fit it exactly. The point of the conductor is now to be paſſed into the lachrymal duct ; and being puſhed in till it reaches the noſtril, which may be known either by inſerting a probe into it, or by a few drops of blood falling from the noſe, the conductor is to be withdrawn ; leaving the compreſſor upon the brim of the canula, which muſt be firmly preſſed down with the left hand, while the conductor is removed with the other. This being done, the compreſſor muſt next be taken out ; and to diſcover whether the canula be at a proper depth, a little milk or water ſhould be injected thro’ it. If the injection paſs, it will ſhow that the canula is properly placed. If, on the contrary, any obſtruction occur, there will be reaſon to ſuſpect that it is already puſhed too far, and that it presses againſt the os ſpongioſum inferius ; in which caſe the canula muſt be withdrawn, ſhortened, and reintroduced as before.</p><p>The ſore ought to be kept open for eight or ten days after the operation with ſoft lint ſpread with emollient ointment, and the whole covered with a compreſs of ſoft linen ſecured with a bandage. An injection of milk and water ſhould be daily paſſed through the canula ; and as ſoon as the ſore looks clean and healthy, the dreſſings ſhould be entirely removed, and a piece of court plaſter laid over it. In this ſtate it is to be left to heal ; but the plaſter muſt be renewed, if matter appear to form beneath it. By this method Mr Pellier finds, that fiſtula lachrymalis, not depending upon diſeaſes of the contiguous bones or of the conſtitution, may commonly be completely cured in two or three weeks, which, by the uſual practice, might require ſeveral months.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XV. <hi rend="italic">Of Affections of the Nose.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.

When theſe remedies likewiſe fail in their effect, a piece of catgut or wire may be introduced through the noſe into the throat, and brought out at the mouth ; a piece of ſponge, or a bolſter of lint of a ſize ſufficient to fill the back-part of the noſtril, is then to be fixed to it ; the ſponge is next to be drawn back and properly applied. Another is to be applied to the anterior part of the noſtril and ſecured.

When the diſeaſe is local, and not depending upon any conſtitutional affection, aſtringent ſolutions are found to be the moſt uſeful, ſuch as a decoction of bark or that mixed with alum. Doſſils of lint dipped in theſe are to be introduced into the noſtrils three or four times a-day, or ſome prefer the injection of ſuch fluids by means of a ſyringe as being more effectual. If ſtronger aſtringents be neceſſary, a ſolution of ſtyptic powder ought to be uſed. At bed-time an ointment prepared with zinc or with lapis calaminaris ought likewiſe to be applied.

But when the portion of the duct next the mouth is entirely obliterated, an artificial paſſage muſt be made into the mouth, and an union formed between the opening and that part of the duct which proceeds from the parotid gland. The artificial paſſage ought to be as much as poſſible in the direction of the natural duct. For this purpoſe a perforation of a proper ſize is to be made obliquely into the mouth with the trocar (fig. 44.), from the ſide of the wound exactly oppoſite and contiguous to the under extremity of the upper portion of the duct ; and then a piece of leaden probe of the ſize of the perforator ſhould be introduced by means of the canula, and be kept in the cheek till the ſides of the opening become callous ; when the lead being withdrawn, the extremities of the artificial and natural ducts are to be brought into contact, and retained there by adheſive plaſter till the cure is completed. Another method has, in a few inſtances, been followed by Mr Latta (ſee his <hi rend="italic">System of Surgery),</hi> of introducing one end of a bit of catgut into the artificial opening, and bringing it out at the mouth, while the other is introduced a little way into the extremity of the natural duct, and retained by adheſive plaſter till the wound is healed. Whichever way the operation is done, the patient ſhould live upon spoon-meat, and make as little motion as poſſible with his lips or jaws.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect;</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Of the Hare-lip.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> hare-lip is a fiſſure in the upper lip, very ſeldom in the under one. It is attended with want of ſubſtance, and has its name from a reſemblance to the lip of a hare. In general it is only a ſimple fiſſure, though ſometimes it is double ; in which caſe it renders a cure more difficult to be executed. There are many lips where the want of ſubſtance is ſo great, that the edges of the fiſſure cannot be brought together, or at leaſt where they can but juſt touch, and then the attempt ſhould be forborne. It is likewiſe improper in infants, and ought not to be performed till ſeveral months after they have been weaned, when they will have acquired more ſtrength to undergo the operation, and will be leſs liable to be attacked with bowel complaints, which frequently make them cry at an earlier period of infancy.</p><p>In proceeding to the operation, the patient, if a child; ſhould be ſecured upon a perſon’s knee, or rather perhaps upon a table ; but if an adult, he is to be ſeated upon a chair, in a proper light. The fraenum connecting the gums to the upper lip is to be divided ; if a fore-tooth project so much as to prevent the parts from being brought properly together, it is to be extracted ; or when the fiſſure runs through the bones of the palate, if a ſmall portion of the bone project, this muſt be removed. Matters being so far adjuſted, the operator is to lay hold of one ſide of the fiſſure between the thumb and fore-finger, or between the forceps (fig. 45.), then with a pair of sharp and very ſtrong ſciſſars (fig. 46.), or with a ſcalpel, to cut off a thin portion of the lip, and to repeat the ſame thing upon the other side of the fiſſure, ſo as to render the whole edges of the fiſſure completely raw ; by which, if the operation be properly performed, a piece will be ſeparated in form like an inverted V. After the inciſions have been made, the veſſels ſhould be allowed to bleed freely to prevent inflammation ; and when the bleeding has ceaſed, the ſides of the wound are to be brought accurately together, and kept in that ſtate by the twiſted future. The firſt pin ought to be as near as poſſible to the under edge of the lip ; another is to be inſerted near the upper angle ; and if the patient be an adult, a third pin will generally be neceſſary, half way between the other two. In paſſing them, they ought to go rather deeper than half through the lip, that the edges of the wound may be kept properly in contact. An aſſiſtant now keeps the parts together, while the operator applies a firm waxed ligature firſt to the under pin ; and having made three or four turns with it in the form of an eight figure (fig. 47.) it should then be carried about the second, and in a ſimilar way about the third, care being taken that the thread be drawn of a proper tightneſs. After the ligature is ſecured, a piece of lint, covered with ſome mucilage, ſhould be laid over the wound to protect it from the air ; and this is commonly all the bandage neceſſary. When, however, from a great want of ſubſtance, the retraction has been conſiderable, ſome advantage is derived from the uſe of adheſive plaſters applied to the cheeks and tied between the pins. During the time of the cure the patient ſhould be fed upon ſpoon-meat, and prevented from making any exertion with the lips, otherwiſe the cure might be conſiderably retarded. At the end of five or six days the pins may be taken out, when the parts will commonly be found completely united.</p><p>In the caſe of a double hare-lip, the operation ſhould be firſt done upon one fiſſure ; and when a cure is completed there, it may be done ſafely upon the other.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Of Extirpation of Cancerous Lips.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> under lip is much more frequently attacked with cancer than the upper, or indeed than any other part of the body : And as little dependence is to be placed upon external applications or internal remedies, recourſe muſt be had to the knife as the only certain method of cure.</p><p>When the diſeaſe has not attacked any conſiderable part of the lip, the diſeaſed part is to be cut out, and the wound cured by the twiſted future. The operation ought therefore to be performed early, to allow the parts to be brought properly together. The general ſteps of the operation are nearly the ſame as in the operation for hare-lip, and therefore need not be repeated. It is only to be obſerved, that all the diſeaſed parts are to be removed, taking care to make the cut in ſuch a way as will moſt readily admit of the twiſted or hare-lip future. When the parts can be brought together, the lip will have nearly the ſame appearance as in the operation for hare-lip ; but when the diſeaſe ſpreads over a conſiderable part of the lip, ſo as to prevent the ſound parts from being united after the diſeaſed parts have been removed, all that can be done is to remove the part affected, ſecure the bleeding vessels, and dreſs the ſore like any other recent wound.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV. <hi rend="italic">Of Affections of the Teeth.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> dentition the gums inflame and ſwell about the parts where the teeth are afterwards to appear ; the child is continually rubbing the gums with its finger; the ſaliva is commonly increaſed in quantity, though ſometimes the contrary happens; ſometimes the bowels are remarkably coſtive, tho' more frequently the reverſe : there is generally quick pulſe, with heat, and other ſymptoms of fever; and on ſome occaſions theſe ſymptoms are attended with convulſions; The means found to be moſt uſeful here are ſuch as<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0148.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0142"/>
are moſt effectual in allaying irritation ; as opiates, bliſters, and eſpecially warm-bathing. When theſe fail, cutting the gum by means of a sleme (fig. 48.), over the approaching tooth, is frequently found to remove every ſymptom ; but this ought to be done earlier than it commonly is to have the full effect. Whenever the ſymptoms give reaſon to think that a tooth is approaching, the gums ſhould be cut freely over that part where the teeth may be first expected. When the ſymptoms recur, the operation ſhould be repeated. A crucial inciſion is attended with ſtill more effect ; and the bleeding which afterwards takes place is of conſiderable ſervice. The inciſion ſhould always be carried as far as the tooth, which ought to be ſomewhat expoſed ; and when properly done, is frequently followed with immediate relief Sometimes the ſame kind of ſymptoms attend the cutting of the second ſet, particularly of the dentes sapientiae. When this is owing to the thickneſs of the gums, ſcarifying gives the greateſt relief; but ſometimes it is for want of room in the jaw, and then the tooth ſhould be drawn.</p><p>Derangement of the teeth happens more frequently in the ſecond than in the firſt ſet, and more commonly in the sore than in the back teeth. This may be owing to the firſt ſet remaining in the jaw after the ſecond have appeared. Another cauſe is a waſte of ſpace in the jaw ; and a third is a mal-conformation of the teeth, where they are too large in proportion to the jaw, and therefore overlope each other. The remedy is the ſame in each of theſe caſes, viz. to extract the teeth which ſtand in the way of the reſt, to allow thoſe which are out of their place to come into the row, and put on a more uniform appearance.</p><p>The uſual method of moving teeth which are out of the row is, by fixing them with a ligature to the neareſt teeth ; or the ſame thing is done by metalline plates or pieces of wire. But theſe methods have not been found fully to answer the purpoſe intended, though in ſome caſes they may be uſeful. When one or more front teeth are accidentally drawn out of the jaw, they ought to be immediately replaced. When the teeth are broken over or otherwiſe injured, they may be ſupplied with others tranſplanted from the jaws of another person; but this can only be done when the sockets have been newly emptied, for after inflammation comes on it is impracticable. In theſe caſes the inflammation muſt be allowed to ſubſide, and then artificial teeth can be readily adapted.</p><p>When the teeth are looſened by external violence, by falls and blows, or by improper uſe of inſtruments in pulling diſeaſed teeth in the neighbourhood of ſound ones, they may again be made tolerably faſt by preſſing them as firmly as poſſible into their ſockets, and preserving them ſo with ligatures of catgut, Indian weed, or waxed ſilk, and keeping the patient upon ſpoon-meat till they are firm. When looſe teeth are owing to tartar, nothing will faſten them till the cauſe be removed ; and this ought to be done early, otherwiſe it will have no effect. Frequently the teeth become looſe from a ſpongineſs in the gums, often, but improperly, attributed to ſcurvy. The beſt remedy is ſcarifying the gums deeply, and allowing them to bleed freely ; this ſhould be repeated till they are fully fattened. Mild aſtringents, as tincture of bark, are here attended with good effects, tho’ thoſe of a ſtrong nature will certainly do harm. The mouth ſhould be frequently waſhed with cold water ſtrongly impregnated with theſe, and the patient ſhould not uſe the teeth which have been looſe till they become firm again. The looſening of the teeth in old age cannot be remedied, as it is owing to a waiting of their ſockets, from which the teeth loſe their ſupport.</p><p>The teeth ſometimes become yellow or black without any adventitious matter being obſerved in them ; at other times they become foul, and give a taint to the breath, in conſequence of the natural mucus of the mouth, of part of the food remaining too long about them. The moſt frequent cauſe of foul teeth is the ſubſtance called <hi rend="italic">tartar,</hi> which ſeems to be a depoſition from the ſaliva, and with which the teeth are often almoſt entirely incruſted. When this ſubſtance is allowed to remain, it inſinuates itſelf between the gums and the teeth, and then gets down upon the jaw in such a manner as frequently to looſen the teeth. This indeed is by far the moſt common cauſe of looſe teeth, and when they have been long covered with this or with any other matter, it is ſeldom they can be cleaned without the aſſiſtance of inſtruments. But when once they are cleaned, they may generally be kept ſo by rubbing them with a thin piece of ſoft wood made into a kind of bruſh, and dipped into white-wine vinegar ; after which the mouth is to be waſhed with common water.</p><p>When the teeth are to be cleaned by inſtruments, the operator ought, with a linen cloth or with a glove, to preſs againſt the points of the teeth, ſo as to keep them firm in their ſockets, with the fingers of the one hand, while he cleans them with the neceſſary inſtruments, fig. 51. n⁰ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, held in the other; taking care not to ſcrape them ſo hard as to looſen them, or to rub off the enamel. This being done, the teeth ſhould be rubbed over with a ſmall bruſh, or a piece of ſponge dipped in a mixture of cream of tartar and Peruvian bark. The ſame application may be made to the teeth for a few days, after which they may be kept clean as already directed.</p><p>The teeth are ſometimes covered over with a thin dark coloured ſcurf, which has by ſome been miſtaken for a waiting of the enamel, but which is only an extraneous matter covering it. By perſeverance this may be cleaned off as completely as where the teeth are covered with tartar ; but it is apt, after ſome time, to appear again. When this is obſerved, the ſame operation muſt be repeated.</p><p>For the purpoſe of applying powders or waſhes to the teeth, a bruſh or a ſponge is commonly employed ; the latter is certainly preferable, as being leſs in danger of wearing down the enamel, or of ſeparating the teeth.</p><p>The cauſes producing toothach may be, expoſure of the nerve of a tooth, by breaking or wasting of the enamel, inflammation in or about the tooth, or from ſympathy when diſtant parts are affected, as the eye, the ear, the ſtomach, or the uterus, as in time of geſtation. After toothach has once been produced and removed, it is apt to return by expoſure to cold, by taking hot liquids, by hard bodies preſſed againſt the nerve in the time of chewing, by the uſe of a pick-tooth, &amp;c.</p><p>With reſpect to the cure of this diſeaſe, no rule can be laid down which will anſwer with certainty upon all occaſions. No remedy has yet been diſcovered which will at all times even moderate the pain ; relief, however, is frequently obtained from acrid ſubſtances applied to the tooth, ſo as to deſtroy the irritability of the nerves, ſuch as opium, ſpirit of wine, camphire, and eſſential aromatic oils. When theſe fail, bliſters behind the ear, or deſtroying the nerve by the cautious uſe of ſtrong acids, or by a red hot wire frequently applied to the part, have been attended with advantage.</p><p>When a black or mortified ſpot appears on a tooth, it it be quite superficial, it may be removed ; but if it go through the thickneſs of the enamel, it will be more adviſable to let it remain.</p><p>When a ſmall hole breaks out in a tooth, particular attention ſhould be paid to prevent the admiſſion of air. Tin, lead, or gold-leaf, commonly employed for this purpoſe, ſometimes give relief for many months, or even years ; but<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0149.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0143"/>
at other times are of little advantage, and in ſome inſtances create great pain. Gum-maſtich or bees-wax are frequently employed, and can be made to fill the cavity of the tooth ſtill better than metalline ſubſtances. When ſtuffing is to be employed, it ought to be done in the intervals of the fits of toothach, otherwiſe it will give great uneasineſs. When it is to be uſed, the whole cavity of the tooth ſhould be filled ; and this is to be done with the inſtruments, fig. 52. n⁰ 1, 2, 3.</p><p>When the remedies made uſe oſ for the removal oſ toothach have failed in their effect, and it is found that the complaint ſtill continues, it will be neceſſary to extract the tooth. In doing this, it may be obſerved, that all the teeth may be pulled to either ſide, excepting the dentes sapientiæ of the lower jaw, which ought to be pulled outwards, otherwiſe the jaw may be ſplintered. As ſoon as the ſocket is cleared of blood, if the tooth be not much ſpoiled, it may be immediately replaced, when it will become as uſeful as before. It is difficult, however, to replace the large grinders, on account of their diverging roots. The more perpendicularly the teeth are pulled, the leſs contuſion and injury will be done to the jaws and alveoli. But as no inſtrument has been yet invented capable of effecting this properly, ſurgeons are obliged to be contented with an inſtrument which acts in a lateral direction. One of the beſt is that (fig. 53.) in form of a key, with a claw and fulcrum. Previous to the operation, this ſhould be covered with a linen rag, to prevent the gum from ſuffering. After dividing the gum, or separating it from the tooth, the claw, is to be fixed as deep between the teeth and gum as poſſible. Then the fulcrum is to be applied on the oppoſite ſide. The ſurgeon may now, with one turn of the handle of the inſtrument, pull the tooth out at once. But the turn ſhould not be effected by a ſudden jerk, but in the moſt cautious and slow manner. When it happens to be one of the great molares, whoſe roots diverge very much, and when they are firmly fixed, after only looſing it with the firſt pull, the claw of the inſtrument is to be applied to the other ſide of the tooth, and the turn given in a contrary direction to the first. After it has been ſufficiently looſened in this manner, it is to be laid hold of by a common teeth forceps (fig. 54.), and extracted in the eaſieſt manner. Upon extraction of the tooth, any detached ſplinters occurring are to be immediately removed. Should any conſiderable hemorrhagy take place, the patient may take ſome cold water, vinegar, or ſpirit of wine into his mouth, and doſſils of lint may be introduced into the ſocket. After all theſe fail, recourſe muſt be had to the actual cautery.</p><p>When ſtumps occur from caries, or when the teeth have broken in time of the extracting, the common key will ſometimes remove them ; if that fail, the punch (fig. 55.) is to be uſed.

When the boil is owing merely to inflammation, after the matter is evacuated, the complaint goes off ; but when it proceeds from a caries of a tooth, it will continue as long as the cauſe remains ; the tooth therefore ought to be extracted. After the absceſs has burſt, if the matter continue to be discharged, it may ſometimes be dried up by injecting ſome aſtringent liquor ; but the moſt effectual method is to lay the abſceſs fully open, and to heal it from the bottom by doſſils of lint. Sometimes abſceſſes occur of a more obſtinate nature, owing to a carious ſtate of the jaw.

As moſt people with to avoid the pulling of a tooth, when it does not appear to be abſolutely necessary, the perforation is commonly made in the way laſt mentioned. Some authors, however, object to this, as not giving a ſufficiently depending opening to the matter. As ſoon as the matter is discharged, a plug may be introduced into the perforation, which may be removed frequently to allow the matter to paſs out, and to admit aſtringent ſolutions of bark, &amp;c. to be occasionally thrown into the cavity of the antrum. In this way a cure is obtained, if the bones be ſound ; but if they are carious, it is impoſſible to expect a cure till the diſeaſed portions of the bone exfoliate and be removed. When cloated blood is formed in the antrum, it is to be removed in the fame manner. Sometimes the tumor of the cheek is owing to a ſwelling of the bones, and no matter is found in the antrum : In that caſe the operation does harm.

The tumors here have been commonly conſidered as to be of a ſcirrhous nature ; but they are neither attended with ſhooting pain, nor are they apt to degenerate into cancer ; neither do ſwellings return after the tonſils have been extirpated : hence they ought not to be removed till by theſe ſize they impede deglutition or reſpiration ; but whenever they do this, they may be removed with ſafety. The only proper method of removing them is that by ligatures, which are not only void of danger, but ſeldom fail to perform a cure. If the baſe of the tonſil be ſmaller than the top, the ligature is to be uſed as for polypi in the throat ; but however broad the baſe of it may be, much difficulty will ſeldom occur in fixing it, for the ſwelling is always very prominent. In diſeaſes of this kind both tonſils are generally affected ; but if the removal of one of them forms a ſufficient paſſage for the food, the other may be allowed to remain. When, however, it is neceſſary to extirpate them both, the inflammatory ſymptoms produced by the extirpation of the firſt ſhould be allowed to ſubſide before any attempt be made to remove the other.</p><p>When the form of the tonſils happens to be conical, ſo that the ligature would be apt to flip over their extremities, Mr Cheſelden has recommended a needle (fig. 56.), with an eye near the point : a double ligature being put into the eye, the inſtrument is to be puſhed through the centre of the baſe of the tumor, and the ligature being laid hold of by a hook and pulled forwards, the inſtrument is to be withdrawn ; then it is to be divided, and ſo tied that each part may ſurround one half of the tumor. This method however is ſcarcely ever found to be neceſſary.</p><p>Enlargements of the uvula, from inflammation or from other cauſes, may generally be removed by the frequent uſe of aſtringent gargles, as of ſtrong infuſions of red roſe-leaves or of Peruvian bark. But when theſe fail, and the enlargement is ſo conſiderable as to give great uneasineſs by impeding deglutition, irritating the throat, and ſo cauſing cough, retching, and vomiting, extirpation is the only thing upon which any dependence can be placed. Exciſion is the readieſt method when the uvula is only elongated ; ſhut when the ſize is conſiderable, dangerous hemorrhagies ſometimes attend this method ; on which account a ligature is preferable. The operation may be readily performed by thoſe of the common kind; ſome prefer the curved probe-pointed biſtoury.</p><p>In performing the operation, the ſpeculum oris (fig. 57.) is neceſſary to keep the mouth ſufficiently open, and the uvula ſhould be laid hold of by a pair of forceps or a ſmall hook, so as to keep it firm, and prevent it from falling into the throat.

When inſects are deep ſeated in the ear, they ought firſt to be killed, by filling the passage with oil, or any other fluid which proves noxious to them, without hurting the tympanum. They may then be waſhed out by injecting warm water frequently by means of a ſyringe.</p><p>Wax is one of the moſt frequent cauſes of deafneſs, and it may be readily detected by looking into the ear in a clear ſunſhine.</p><p>Various methods have been propoſed for removing wax from the ear ; but one, not inferior to any, is to throw in frequently, by means of a ſyringe (fig. 61.), warm milk and water, or water in which a little ſoap has been diſſolved. Aſſiſtance may likewiſe be given here, by uſing along with the injection a blunt probe or fine hair pencil, by which the bottom of the paſſage may be cleared out. After the wax is removed, the patient ought to guard againſt the effects of cold by introducing a little wool for ſome time into the meatus. When deafneſs is owing to a deficiency of wax in the ear, a little oil of almonds, or even oils of a hotter nature, or ſoap, or galbanum &amp;c. have been of ſervice.</p><p>Purulent matter is now and then formed in the ears of adults, but oftener in thoſe oſ children. Sometimes it is produced by ulcers ſituated in the lining of the meatus, or upon the membrane oſ the tympanum. It ſeems to be merely a local affection, and does not, as many have ſuppoſed, originate from morbid humours of the ſyſtem. The remedies beſt calculated for removing it are ſuch as are of a moderately aſtringent nature, as a weak ſolution of ſaccharum ſaturni. A little of this may be dropped in two or three times a-day, but it is ſtill better to uſe a ſyringe. If the diſcharge has continued long, it may be proper, in addition to the other applications, to keep open a ſmall bliſter for ſome time in the neck, arm, or wherever it may be thought moſt convenient.</p><p>It ſometimes happens, particularly in old people, that, from expoſure to a ſtream of cold air, the tympanum becomes affected, and a noiſe is heard by the patient like the ruſhing of water. In other caſes the patient is incapable of accurately diſtinguishing the words of ſome persons ſpeaking in a'loud tone of voice ; or, in mixed companies, he hears only a confuſion of ſounds. Complaints of this kind frequently originate from a relaxation of the ſoft parts of the tympanum ; and though a complete cure is not very frequently performed, yet conſiderable advantage is ſometimes derived from the uſe of hot ſtimulating oils, and from keeping the part warm at the ſame time with a little wool. When deafneſs ariſes from affections of this nature, ſome aſſiſtance may be derived from collecting the ſound, ſo as to make a ſtronger impreſſion upon the internal ear. A variety of inſtruments have been invented for this purpoſe. Some uſe a convoluted tube as is repreſented in fig. 62, (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Trumpet);</hi> others a sort of cup, fig. 63. which is concealed under the hair, and fixed to the head with ſtraps.</p><p>In ſcrophulous habits, ſuppurations ſometimes occur in the neighbourhood of the ear, and penetrate into the external paſſage, or into the tympanum itſelf; after which it is not unuſual for the ſmall bones of the ear to loſe their connecting membrane, and to be discharged along with the matter, and for caries to enſue in the tympanum ; in conſequence of which a high degree of deafness is produced, which can never be removed. In ſuch a ſituation little elſe can be attempted than to preſerve the parts clean and free from ſmell, which is readily done by injecting a little warm milk and water morning and evening by means of a ſyringe. If this be neglected, the matter from the carious bones is apt to become offenſive ; and it commonly continues till the diſeaſed parts are either diſſolved and discharged, or probably during the life of the patient.</p><p>Beſides the affections which may ariſe in the meatus externus, and may be the cauſe of deafneſs, others may occur in or about the meatus internus or euſtachian tube, which may have in part the ſame effect, though by no mean in the ſame degree.

originate in the cavity of the tube, or ſwellings or ulcers in the throat may affect it ſo as to cauſe ſome degree of deafneſs. When this is the caſe, it is practicable to introduce a pipe, fig. 64. crooked at the extremity, through the mouth or noſe, and then to inject into the mouth of the euſtachian tube any mild fluid which may be thought fitteſt for the purpoſe, though no great dependence is to be placed upon the attempt.</p><p>Formerly piercing the lobes of the ears was ſometimes recommended in complaints of the head, and was conſidered as a chirurgical operation ; but it is now never practiſed, unleſs for the sake of ornament. As the ſubſtances ſuſpended at the ears are ſometimes ſo heavy as to tear down the parts, the perforation ſhould be made as high on the lobes as can be done with propriety, and care ſhould be taken that the perforations be made exactly in the correſponding parts of the ears. Previous to the perforation the lobes may be marked with ink ; then the patient being ſeated, the lobe of the ear ſhould be ſtretched upon a piece of cork placed beneath it, and perforated with an inſtrument, fig. 65. The cork is then to be withdrawn with the point of the inſtrument ſticking in it : A ſmall piece of lead, or ſilver, or gold-wire, is now to be inſerted into that part of the inſtrument which remains in the ear, and on being drawn into the perforation, the wire is to be left in it.

Experience has shown, indeed, that in by much the greater number of caſes, by a total ſtoppage of reſpiration for only five or six minutes, life is irrecoverably deſtroyed.</p><p>In performing the operation, where, from the nature of the caſe, ſufficient time is allowed, the patient is to be laid on his back upon a table, and properly ſecured by aſſiſtants. A longitudinal inciſion is to be made, about an inch and an half long, through the ſkin and cellular ſubſtance ; beginning at the under edge of the thyroid cartilage ; the ſterno-hyoid and thyroid muſcles are then to be ſeparated ; the thyroid gland is to be avoided as much as poſſible, on account of its vaſcularity. As ſoon as the trachea is laid bare, the bleeding-veſſels, to prevent coughing, are to be ſecured ; then, with a common lancet, a puncture is to be made as high as may ſeem practicable between two rings of the trachea, of ſuch a ſize as to admit the introduction of a double canula (fig. 65.), large enough to allow the patient to breathe freely, and of ſuch a length as neither to be in danger of slipping out, nor of irritating the back part of the trachea. Such a canula has long been recommended by Doctor Monro in his courſe of ſurgery. Previous to the introduction the canula may be put through ſeveral plies of linen compreſs ; or theſe may be firſt slit half way down, and applied ſo that any of them maybe removed and replaced at pleaſure. This double canula is to be fixed by a ſtrap round the neck ; and when mucus obſtructs the paſſage of the inſtrument, the inner tube can be withdrawn, cleared, and readily replaced ; while the patient is, during this time, breathing through the outer one ; and by means of a ſcrew the tribes can be regulated according to the motions of the trachea. After the canula is fixed, it ought to be covered with a piece of muffin or crape, to prevent the admiſſion of duſt, inſects, &amp;c.

The operation may be rendered neceſſary, where obſtructions of the ceſophagus become ſo complete as to prevent the paſſage of nouriſhment into the ſtomach, or of air into the lungs. But it is evident, that when the obſtructing cauſe is in the under end of the ceſophagus, any inciſion becomes uſeleſs.</p><p>In performing the operation, the patient is to be ſecured in the ſame manner as for bronchotomy, and an inciſion made through the ſkin and cellular ſubſtance as directly oppoſite as poſſible to the part obſtructed. If it be done with a view to remove an obſtruction, the muſcles over the trachea are to be pulled to one ſide, and the trachea to the other, by means of a blunt hook ; by which the ceſophagus will be brought into view. If the obſtructed part now come in ſight, the inciſion is to be made directly upon the obſtructing body, which is to be extracted by a pair of ſmall forceps ; but if the obſtruction happen to be farther down than we can with ſafety have acceſs to the oeſophagus, the inciſion is to be enlarged as much as poſſible, that the forceps may be able to reach and extract it.

In ſome caſes, the nipples are ſo flat, and ſo much sunk in the breaſt, as to render it difficult for the child to lay hold of them. Here aſſiſtance can ſometimes be given, by the mother preſſing back the prominent part of the breaſt, ſo as to make the nipple project between two of ſher fingers. Should this be inſufficient, the nipple may be made to project by applying to it a ſtout child ſeveral months old : but when this cannot be done, breaſt-glasses, ſuch äs fig. 68. may anſwer the ſame purpoſe.

If proper attention be paid to theſe remedies, they will commonly be found to have the desired effect ; but if the contrary ſhould happen, another remains to be mentioned, which, in different inſtances, has given great relief : it conſiſts in the application of a thin ſkin to the nipple, as the neck and part of the body of a ſwine’s bladder with an aperture in it ; which, being properly moiſtened and fixed to the breaſt, will completely protect <hi rend="italic">it</hi> in the time of ſucking.

The fluids which collect in the pleura are, ſerum, blood, air, or pus. A collection of water or ſerum is frequently found in the thorax, combined with dropſy in other parts of the body ; but the affection is often local, and it is then chiefly that advantage is to be derived from an operation. Beſides, in the two great cavities of the thorax, collections of water are frequently met with in the pericardium, and are ſaid to be ſometimes diſcovered between the layers of the anterior mediaſtinum. The diſeaſe is marked by the following ſymptoms : There is a ſenſe of weight or oppreſſion in the thorax, and difficulty of breathing ; the patient has frequently a more uneaſy ſenſation in one ſide than in the other ; has ſudden ſtartings during ſleep, with a ſenſe of ſuffocation ; is troubled with a frequent dry cough ; the pulſe is ſmall and irregular ; the ſkin dry, and the urine ſcanty.</p><p>With theſe ſymptoms there are commonly other marks of dropſy ; and the patient ſometimes, upon any ſudden motion, is ſenſible of an undulation within the cheſt ; and when the quantity of water is conſiderable, the undulation will even be heard by the byſtanders, if the body be ſmartly agitated. For this purpoſe, the patient’s body ſhould be uncovered while under examination ; and the ſurgeon ſhould place his hand upon the breaſt near the ſternum ; then an aſſiſtant ought to raiſe the patient ſuddenly from an horizontal to an erect poſture, or to ſtand behind the patient and make ſudden jerks ; when, if water be preſent, the undulation will be felt ; but it is neceſſary to guard againſt being deceived by the noiſe ſometimes made by the contents of the ſtomach.</p><p>When the water is collected in one side only, if the diſeaſe be of long standing, for the moſt part that ſide is more prominent than the other. If the water be in the pericardium, the ſymptoms are nearly the ſame as thoſe above enumerated, with this difference, that the pain is generally felt behind, and to the left ſide of the ſternum ; and the ſtroke of the heart is as if buried in water, while an undulatory motion has been ſaid to be felt oppoſite to the anterior extremities of the third, fourth, and fifth ribs.</p><p>In the treatment of this diſeaſe, little advantage can be derived from internal remedies. Squills, cream of tartar, mercury, and digitalis, are upon ſome occaſions attended with advantage ; but the only method ſrom which we can expect any decree of ſucceſs is the removing of the water by an operation, which ſhould be performed as ſoon as there is reaſon to expect that danger may ariſe from delaying it longer. The operation is done in the ſame way as ſhall be afterwards deſcribed in the caſe of empyema.</p><p>Blood collected in the thorax is always extravaſated thro’ ſome wound or rupture of the veſſels of the lungs or thorax. The breathing becomes oppreſsed, the motion of the heart and arteries feeble and irregular, and all theſe ſymptoms are more diſtreſſing than collections of other fluids. As it frequently happens, in caſes of this kind, that ſome of the veſſels of the lungs are injured, part of the blood is thrown up by coughing ; which, when conſiderable, gives a temporary relief to the lungs and heart ; and while this is the caſe, no operation is neceſſary ; but whenever the action of theſe parts becomes much impeded by a great accumulation of blood, a perforation ought to be made to diſcharge it. When the extravaſated blood is too firmly coagulated to paſs off by a perforation, the wound ought to be made considerably larger ; and if this be inſufficient, injections of warm water ought to be thrown in, and allowed to remain for ſome time, to promote the diſſolution of the maſs, which is afterwards to be evacuated. If the extravaſation has been occaſioned by a wound in the lower part of the thorax, a new perforation will be unneceſſary ; an enlargement of the wound will be quite ſufficient. But if it be ſituated in the upper part of the cavity, a perforation in the<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0154.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0148"/>
middle and lateral part of the thorax ought to be made, that the blood may be freely discharged. In caſe of a rib being fractured, or a vesſel ruptured, the inciſion ought to be made as neat as poſſible to the part affected, to allow the blood to eſcape, and looſe pieces of bones to be removed.</p><p>The diſcharge of air into the cavity of the thorax produces ſymptoms little leſs alarming than thoſe proceeding from the effuſion of blood. In general they are, oppreſſion in breathing ; a tightneſs of the breaſt, attended with pain ; inability to breathe in the recumbent poſture ; a flushing and ſwelling of the face ; a feeble, and at laſt an irregular pulſe : The extremities become cold, and cold ſweats break out on the forehead. With these ſymptoms there is frequently a ſwelling over the external parts of the body, by air getting from the ruptured lungs into the common cellular ſubſtance ; and all these complaints increaſing, the patient, if not quickly relieved, ſoon dies ; ſometimes in a few hours, with marks of ſuffocation.</p><p>Air may be produced in the cavity of the thorax by wounds in the lungs, by mortification generating air in any of the thoracic viſcera, by eroſion of ulcers, by laceration in conſequence of fracture in any of the bones of the thorax.</p><p>We diſtinguiſh this from other collections by the ſudden oppreſſion in breathing, by the flushing of the face, by no blood being thrown up, and by the emphyſematous ſwelling of the cheſt and other parts, which has a crackling noiſe upon being preſſed.</p><p>The treatment of this complaint conſiſts in making ſmall punctures in the affected part of the ſkin, ſo as to allow the air to eſcape from the cellular ſubſtance ; and if the air ſhall have ſpread to diſtant parts of the body, it will eſcape moſt readily by ſuch openings. But if this give no relief to the oppreſſed breathing, paracenteſis ought to be performed. In former times, patients labouring under ſuch ſymptoms were almoſt conſtantly left to their fate. Within theſe few years, however, ſome caſes have occurred where the patients have been completely relieved by an operation being performed. This is done in the ſame way as in the evacuation of other fluids.</p><p>Purulent matter is more frequently collected in the thorax than any other fluid : it is much more frequently formed, however, than confined there. As the matter is uſually ſpit up as faſt as it is generated, in the diſſections of those who have died of this species of conſumption, much extravaſated pus is rarely found in the cavity of the thorax, though a great portion of the lungs be deſtroyed. Caſes not unfrequently occur, however, which require the operation ; and theſe may be diſtinguiſhed by the following ſymptoms : The patient at firſt generally complains of a fixed pain in ſome part of the thorax, attended with heat, quick pulſe, and other ſymptoms of inflammation ; reſpiration becomes oppressed ; he is unable to lie on the ſound ſide ; or, if both ſides be affected, can only lie on his back ; has a constant tickling cough, clammy ſweats, frequent rigors or shiverings. If theſe ſymptoms be attended with an enlargement of the affected side, or with a ſoft cedematous fulneſs there, and, along with theſe, if there be a ſenſible undulation of a fluid, it may be concluded that a collection of matter is formed. The matter is commonly firſt formed in the ſubſtance of the lungs, and is afterwards discharged into the cavity of the pleura, though in many inſtances large quantities of purulent matter have been found to originate from an inflamed ſtate of the pleura.</p><p>The operation ought to be performed as ſoon as there is evidence of the collection being the cauſe of the oppreſſed breathing, and that there are no ſigns of this being relieved by expectoration. The operation ought to be done upon the part where the collection is ſuppoſed to be ſituated ; and this may be known by the ſeat of the previous pain, and perhaps by the matter being diſtinguished between two of the ribs. If no matter flow, it is probably ſeated in the ſubſtance of the lungs ; but even in this caſe, ſuch an opening may be uſeful, by taking off the ſupport, and giving the absceſs an opportunity of bursting. If the undulation of the fluid be general, the operation is to be performed in the following manner : The patient is to be laid in an horizontal poſture, with the affected ſide inclining a little over a table. An inciſion is then to be made with a ſcalpel through the ſkin and cellular ſubſtance, between the sixth and ſeventh ribs, and half way between the ſpine and ſternum, from one to two inches in length, and in the direction of the ribs. The muſcles are then to be cut through, keeping as near as poſſible to the upper edge of the inferior rib to avoid wounding the intercoſtal veſſels and nerves. As there is no occasion for the bottom of the wound being of the fame length with the external inciſion, it may be gradually contracted, ſo as at laſt to be only about the half. The pleura being now expoſeſt, is to be divided by flight ſcratches, taking the aſſiſtance of a furrowed probe to prevent the lungs from being injured, in caſe they ſhall be found adhering to the ribs. If the contrary takes place, the fluid will rush out immediately upon a ſmall opening being made into the cavity of the thorax ; but if an adheſion appear, and if it be slight, which may be known by the introduction of a blunt probe, as much of it may probably be ſeparated as to allow the fluid to eſcape. In caſe it be conſiderable, the inciſion is either to be continued a little nearer to the ſternum, or an attempt made in ſome other part. After the fluid is obſerved to flow, it will be proper to introduce a ſilver canula, fig. 69. at the opening ; by which means it will run more readily off, or can be more eaſily flopped in caſe the patient become faint. If the quantity of fluid be not conſiderable, it may generally be drawn off at once ; but if it be great, partial evacuations ought to be made at different intervals, as circumſtances may direct.</p><p>The canula therefore ſhould be ſo formed, that by means of a ſtrap put round the body of the patient, it can be readily ſecured. Its mouth is to be ſhut by means of a cork. A pledget of emollient ointment is to be laid over the wound ; and the whoſe being fixed by a napkin and ſcapulary bandage, the patient ſhould be laid to reſt. The remainder may be drawn off, probably in a day or two, or as ſoon as it is ſuppoſed the patient can bear it. After the fluid is carried off, the canula is to be withdrawn and the wound healed ; or in caſe the operator be afraid of bad effects being produced upon the lungs by irritation from the canula, though of this there will be little danger, as the lungs will generally be out of its reach, the ſkin may be ſo drawn back before the firſt inciſion is made as afterwards to ſerve the purpoſe of a valve. And for ſome days after the operation, the inciſion in the integuments may be brought oppoſite to that in the pleura, to allow the matter to run off, or to produce a radical cure by exciting a certain degree of inflammation over the lungs and inside of the thorax.</p><p>After the matter is evacuated, the wound ought to be kept open a conſiderable time for the purpoſe of discharging the matter as faſt as it is collected. If the wound be apt to heal up too ſoon, which will be known by the ſymptoms of oppreſſion being renewed, it will be proper to keep the passage open by tents, or to introduce a bougie or silver canula a few hours occaſionally, till the ſource of the matter be dried up ; which, however, ſeldom happens for a conſiderable time, and frequently never. By attending to this circumſtance, the patient may enjoy good health ; where<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0155.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0149"/>
as, by the neglect of it, a repetition oſ the first operation would ſoon be neceſſary.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXII. <hi rend="italic">Of Paracentesιs of the Abdomen, or Tapping.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> operation is an opening made into the abdomen, in order to empty any quantity of extravaſated water collected in that ſpecies of dropſy called the <hi rend="italic">aſcites.</hi></p><p>A fluid in the cavity of the abdomen is diſcovered by the swelling which it produces ; by a ſense of tightness in the part affected ; by laborious and difficult breathing, eſpecially when in the horizontal poſture ; but particularly by a ſenſe of fluctuation being communicated to the fingers placed on one ſide of the abdomen, while the ſwelling is forcibly ſtruck on the opposite ſide. There is beſides much thirſt, a dry ſkin, ſcantineſs of urine, &amp;c. Whatever may be the influence of diuretics and other evacuations in the cure of general dropſical affections, they are rarely ſerviceable in local diſeaſes of this kind, and even the operation of tapping ſeldom cures the diſtemper ; but it commonly gives the patient eaſe for the preſent time, and is attended with very little pain.</p><p>Upon the ſuppoſition that nothing forbids the extraction of the water, the manner of operating is this : Having placed the patient in an horizontal ſituation, as beſt suited to prevent fainting, and to allow the water to run freely off, the part to be perforated ought to be marked with ink ; and the moſt approved part for the operation ſeems to be at a point lying at nearly an equal diſtance between the umbilicus and the centre of the ſpine of the os ilium, this being moſt out of the way of any of the viſcera, and ſufficiently depending to allow the water to eſcape ; and as the ſpleen is leſs frequently enlarged than the liver, the left ſide is generally preferred. Various means have been uſed for applying an equal preſſure in this operation. Some apply preſſure by the hands of aſſiſtants ; others uſe a broad piece of flannel, or other kinds of cloth, ſlit a certain way from each end ; then the ends are drawn by aſſiſtants till ſufficient preſſure is made. Broad belts are uſed by ſome practitioners ; but one of the beſt contrivances for this purpoſe is the bandage invented by the late Dr Monro, (fig. 70.) Till very lately, a puncture was firſt made with a lancet, then a trocar of a round form (fig. 71.), and with a triangular point, was conſtantly uſed : but the entrance of this inſtrument being always attended with difficulty and pain, a flat trocar is now very frequently employed ; and that invented by Mr Andree (fig. 72.) ſeems the beſt which has yet appeared. The bandage being now applied and drawn a little tight, the part to be punctured is to project a little over the edge of the bed. The operator fixes the head of the trocar in the palm, while the ſore finger directs the point of the inſtrument. He is then to push it forwards till he is ſatisfied, by the want of reſiſtance, that the end of the canula has reached the cavity of the abdomen. The perforator is now to be withdrawn, and the water allowed to flow as long as any of it can be taken off, the bandage being ſrom time to time pulled to favour the diſcharge: But if the patient become faint, a ſtop for a few minutes ſhould be put to the diſcharge every now and then, by placing the point of the finger upon the mouth of the canula. If any of the viſcera happen to ſtop the flow of the water before the ſwelling is much diminiſhed, a blunt probe is to be introduced, but bent at the end, lest it slip into the cavity of the abdomen. When the ſerum is thick and gelatinous, it may ſometimes be neceſſary to introduce a larger trocar than the one firſt employed. When the water does not flow, becauſe it is collected into ciſts, the canula is to be withdrawn, and the wound covered with a pledget of ſimple ointment. The operation may then be renewed immediately, or on the following day, upon the oppoſite ſide of the abdomen, or in the moſt depending part of the tumor, in whatever part of the abdomen it may be placed.</p><p>During the operation it is neceſſary to keep up a preſſure on the abdomen, otherwiſe the patient will be apt to fall into faintings from the weight on the great veſſels of the abdomen being taken off, and the sinking of the diaphragm ſucceeding, in conſequence of which more blood flows into the inferior veſſels than uſual, the ſuperior ones are left too empty, and thus the regular progreſs of the circulation is interrupted. To obviate this, the preſſure muſt not only be made during the operation, but be afterwards continued. As to the dreſſing, it has been already mentioned, that the wound may be covered with a pledget of ſimple ointment ; but between the skin and the roller ſome recommend a piece of flannel dipped in brandy or ſpirit of wine to be applied. The bandaging in this manner may even have ſome effect in preventing a return of the diſorder. When the water again collects, the operation ſhould be repeated whenever the swelling has acquired a conſiderable ſize : and though this operation does not always effect an abſolute cure, yet it ſometimes preſerves life a great many years, and even a comfortable one, eſpecially if the waters have been long collected.</p><p>After the operation, practitioners adviſe the abdomen to be frequently rubbed with aſtringent ſpirituous applications. This cannot be done for the first two days after the operation, as it would then be improper to remove the bandages ; but after that time, they may be removed daily, for about a quarter of an hour ; and camphorated ſpirit of wine, or other applications which may have a ſimilar effect, may be applied with ſtrong friction over the abdomen, the body being kept, during this period, in the horizontal ſituation, and the bandage applied immediately after the friction is finiſhed.</p><p>Sometimes, inſtead of water, we find air contained in the abdomen ; and the inflation is of two kinds : Firſt, that in which the air is contained in the inteſtines ; in which caſe the patient has frequent exploſions of wind, with a ſwelling of the belly frequently unequal. Secondly, where the air is collected in the cavity of the abdomen ; and here the ſwelling is more equal, without any conſiderable emiſſion. of air. In both varieties of the diſeaſe the ſwelling is more tenſe than where water is contained, and the belly sounds when ſtruck, and affords to the touch and preſſure nearly the ſame ſenſation as is received from a bladder filled with air. Of theſe two diſorders the former is by much the moſt common. Many extenſive practitioners, have never met with an inſtance of true abdominal tympanites. A few well authenticated caſes, however, have occurred, where the air was collected between the containing and contained parts of the abdomen. In ſome of them the air was found to have eſcaped by a ſmall hole in the inteſtines, from which it has been ſuppoſed that the other caſes were of the ſame nature. When the ſymptoms become urgent, there is as much neceſſity for diſcharging the air as for drawing off the water in caſes of dropſy. The preſſure and perforation are to be made in the ſame manner as directed for aſcites, with this difference only, that a trocar of the very ſmalleſt ſize ought to be uſed ; for by it the air can be as eaſily discharged, and the wound will heal more readily than where a large opening is made. After the air has been extracted, the treatment ought to be nearly the ſame as that recommended in caſes of aſcites.<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0156.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0150"/>
<hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Chap.</hi> <hi rend="italic">XXIII.</hi> Of Hernia.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">Of Hernia in general.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> name of <hi rend="italic">hernia</hi> might with propriety be applied to every swelling occaſioned by the diſlodgment of parts from thoſe boundaries within which, in a ſtate of health, they are contained ; but the general acceptation of the term implies a tumor produced by the protruſion of ſome part or parts from the cavity of the abdomen.</p><p>The parts in which herniæ uſually appear are the groin, ſcrotum, labia pudendi, the upper and fore part of the thigh, the umbilicus, and different points between the interstices of the abdominal muſcles. If the ſituation of such tumors be various, the viſcera which produce them are ſtill more ſo ; inſtances having occurred of the ſtomach, uterus, liver, spleen, and bladder, being found to form their contents. But a part of the inteſtinal canal, or a portion of the omentum, are from experience known to be the moſt frequent cause of their formation.</p><p>From theſe circumſtances of ſituation and contents, all the different appellations are derived by which herniæ are diſtinguiſhed. Thus they are termed <hi rend="italic">inguinal, scrotal, femoral, umbilical,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ventral ;</hi> from their appearing in the groin, ſcrotum, thigh, navel, or belly. When the tumor is confined to the groin, the hernia is ſaid to be incomplete, and is termed <hi rend="italic">bubonocele ;</hi> but when the ſwelling reaches down to the bottom of the ſcrotum, the rupture is then ſupposed to be complete, and the diſeaſe obtains the name of <hi rend="italic">ſcrotal rupture,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">oschiocele.</hi></p><p>Of theſe diſorders the inguinal hernia is by much the moſt frequent ; next to that is the femoral. The umbilical is ſeldom obſerved in men, or even in women who have not born children.</p><p>The cauſes which tend to the production of hernia in its more uſual form are theſe :</p><p>I. The containing parts of the abdomen we know to be elaſtic and compreſſible ; whatever, therefore, tends to produce a diminution of capacity in the cavity of the abdomen, muſt occaſion a proportional degree of riſk of ſome of the contained parts being puſhed from their natural situations. Violent coughing, crying, laughter, or great bodily exertion, are attended with more or leſs contraction of the abdominal muſcles, and particularly of the diaphragm ; and as the contraction of theſe muſcles muſt always diminiſh the abdominal cavity, theſe cauſes therefore are frequently found to be productive of hernia.</p><p>II. Falls, in conſequence of the derangement they produce in the abdominal viſcera, from the ſudden and violent ſhock with which they are often attended, are not unfrequently the immediate cauſes of hernia.</p><p>III. Perſons of a preternatural laxity of frame are very liable to herniæ. The containing parts of the abdomen, from the want of a ſufficient tone and firmneſs, are unable in ſuch people to resist on all occaſions the weight of the different viſcera ; and they are therefore more particularly exposed to diſorders of this kind on the ſlighteſt application of any of the cauſes already mentioned.</p><p>IV. Sprains are apt to induce a laxity of the part injured; and have therefore a ſimilar influence in inducing herniæ with general laxity.</p><p>V. It has been obſerved that the people of thoſe countries where oil is much uſed as an article of diet, are particularly liable to herniæ.</p><p>In whatever parts the parietes of the abdomen happen to be weakeſt, theſe various cauſes will moſt readily operate in producing herniæ ; and accordingly we find, that deſcents of the bowels usually occur only in ſuch parts.</p><p>In whatever ſituation a protruſion of any portion of the inteſtines occurs, except in the caſe of the hernia congenita, as all the viſcera are contained within the peritonæam, a portion of that membrane, it is evident, muſt be carried down together with the parts protruded ; and it every such inſtance, it is this portion of the peritonæum which goes down along with the gut, that is termed the <hi rend="italic">hernial ſac.</hi> The ſize of this ſac is various in different subjects, and in different ſtages of the ſame diſorder. On the first appearance of the diſeaſe, it is commonly of no very conſiderable ſize, as such ſwellings ſeldom acquire any great bulk at once : but by repeated deſcents of the bowels, it comes to be puſhed lower and lower, till in ſome inſtances its bulk becomes very conſiderable indeed ; and when in this advanced period of the diſorder the ſac happens to be laid open, it is found to contain either large quantities of omentum or inteſtine, and frequently large portions of each. As the peritonæum has this property in common with many other parts of the body, of thickening according to the degree of any gradual extenſion applied to it, so in many inſtances the thickneſs and firmneſs of the hernial ſac are often really aſtoniſhing.</p><p>All the bad ſymptoms which are found to occur in herniæ, proceed, as may be readily ſuppoſed, either from obſtruction to the paſſage of the feces when the inteſtinal canal forms the tumor, or from a ſtoppage of circulation occaſioned by ſtricture on the prolapſed parts : so that the attending ſymptoms, it is evident, will be always more or leſs hazardous according to the nature of the parts ſo protruded.</p><p>Thus, when omentum alone forms the ſubſtance of hernial ſwellings, as that organ does not appear to be ſo immediately neceſſary for life as many of the other viſcera, such tumors accordingly are not ſo frequently productive of bad conſequences, at leaſt they are ſeldom in any degree ſo hazardous as when a part of the alimentary canal is either protruded by itſelf or along with omentum.</p><p>Although this, however, is in general the caſe, yet it does ſometimes happen, that even an omental rupture is productive of no ſmall degree of danger. When a ſtricture so complete upon it occurs as to occaſion a ſtoppage of circulation in the protruded part, mortification with all its bad conſequences muſt be the certain event : And beſides, the connection between the omentum, ſtomach, and other viſcera, is ſuch, that a ſudden descent of any conſiderable portion of the former ſometimes brings on vomiting, hickup, and other troublesome ſymptoms : And laſtly, although a rupture containing omentum only ought not of itſelf produce any thing bad ; yet as the paſſage through which the omentum has slipped muſt of neceſſity continue open ſo long as that viſcus remains protruded, and as that circumſtance alone muſt, ſo long as it continues, render it more eaſy for a portion of gut likewiſe to get down, this of itſelf is a ſufficient reaſon for intitling even this ſpecies of hernia to the ſerious attention of practitioners.</p><p>But whatever the contents of ſuch ſwellings may be, as their remaining in ſome inſtances for a conſiderable length of time without being productive of any bad ſymptoms, muſt proceed entirely from the circulation continuing to go freely on, notwithſtanding the derangement of parts ; so, whenever a ſtricture occurs up the protruded viſcera, ſufficient to produce either a ſtoppage of the circulation, or of the fecal contents of the alimentary canal, when a portion of gut forms the diſeaſe, the following in general are the ſymptoms which accrue.</p><p>An elaſtic colourleſs ſwelling is obſerved at the part affected ; a flight pain is felt not only in the ſwelling itſelf, but, if part of the alimentary canal is down, an univerſal un<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0157.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0151"/>eaſineſs is perceived over the whole abdomen ; and this pain is always rendered worſe by coughing, sneezing, or any violent exertion. The patient complains of nauſea ; frequent retching ; can get no diſcharge by ſtool ; becomes hot and reſtleſs ; and the pulſe is commonly found quick and hard. When the ſwelling is formed entirely by a portion of gut, if no feces be contained in it, it has a ſmooth, equal surface ; and is eaſily compreſſible, but inſtantly returns to its former ſize on the pressure being removed : but, in gut-ruptures of long ſtanding, where hard faeces have collected in the protruded bowels, considerable inequalities are detected. When again the tumor is compoſed both of gut and omentum, its appearance is always unequal, it feels ſoft and ſomewhat like dough, and of courſe is not ſo elaſtic as when part of the inteſtinal tube only is down ; for although, like the other, it is compreſſible, it does not ſo readily regain its former dimenſions on the preſſure being taken off.</p><p>It will be readily ſupposed, that the ſymptoms we have deſcribed never can happen from the preſence of omentum <hi rend="italic">only :</hi> For although ſtricture produced on a portion of omentum, even when no part of the inteſtinal tube is down, does now and then occaſion a good deal of diſtreſs, ſuch as pain in the part, ſickneſs, vomiting, and twitching pains through the whole belly ; yet no obſtruction of the gut ever occurs from this, and of courſe none of the ſymptoms ever prove ſo alarming as when any part of gut is affected. If theſe ſymptoms we have deſcribed as being pro duced by a ſtrangulated gut, are not now obviated by a removal of the ſtricture which produced them, the nauſea and retching terminate in frequent vomitings, firſt of a bilious, and afterwards of a more fetid matter ; the belly becomes tense ; the pain turns more violent ; a diſtreſſing convulſive hickup comes on ; the fever, which before was not apparently of much conſequence, now becomes very formidable ; and a total want of rest, with a very diſagreeable ſtate of anxiety, continues through the whole courſe of the complaint. — Theſe ſymptoms having gone on with violence for ſome time, the patient is at laſt commonly relieved in a ſudden from all manner of pain ; and then he flatters himſelf that all danger is over. But inſtead of that, the pulſe, from having been hard and frequent, becomes languid and interrupted ; cold ſweat breaks out over the whole body, but eſpecially on the extremities ; the eyes acquire a kind of languor ; the tenſeneſs of the abdomen ſubſides, and the ſwelling of the part affected diſappears ; the teguments covering the parts, which before were either of a natural appearance, or had ſomewhat of a reddiſh inflamed caſt, now acquire a livid hue, and a windy crepitous feel is diſtinguiſhable all over the courſe of the ſwelling. If the protruded parts have not of themſelves gone entirely up, their return is now in general eaſily effected by a ſmall degree of preſſure, and the patient then diſcharges freely by ſtool ; but the cold ſweats increaſing, the hickup turns more violent, and death itſelf is at laſt uſhered in by its uſual forerunners, ſubultus tendinum, and other convulsive twitchings.</p><p>Theſe are the ordinary ſymptoms of what is termed a <hi rend="italic">ſtrangulated</hi> or <hi rend="italic">incarcerated gut-hernia :</hi> that is, when the parts protruded become ſo affected by ſtricture as to produce pain ; and do not either return to their natural ſituations on the patient’s getting into a horizontal poſture, or cannot even be immediately replaced by the hands of a practitioner.</p><p>In whatever ſituation a ſtrangulated hernia occurs, the only rational method of cure, it is evident, muſt conſiſt in the removal of that ſtricture which prevents the return of the protruded parts. It is that ſtricture which ought to be conſidered as the cauſe of all the miſchief ; and unleſs it be removed, nothing effectual can be done for the relief of the patient.</p><p>Various methods have been attempted by practitioners for the removal of ſtricture in theſe diſorders ; all of which may be comprehended under two general heads.</p><p>I. Such as effect a reduction of the protruded parts, without the interposition of inciſion or any chirurgical operation properly ſo called ; and,</p><p>II. A diviſion of the parts producing the ſtricture, ſo as to admit of a replacement of the deranged viscera, conſtituting what is termed the <hi rend="italic">operation for the hernia.</hi></p><p>The remedies to be employed for accompliſhing the firſt of theſe are, a proper poſture of the patient, with the manual aſſiſtance of a practitioner ; blood-letting, ſtimulating clyſters, opiates, the warm bath, and proper applications to the tumor itſelf. If theſe fail, there is then no other means of cure left but the operation of dividing the integuments, and replacing the viſcera.</p><p>As soon as the aſſiſtance of a practitioner is desired for the removal of ſymptoms in caſes of hernia, the firſt circumſtance requiring his attention is the placing of his patient in such a poſture as will moſt probably favour the return of the protruded parts. Placing the patient’s feet over the ſhoulders of another perſon, while his body is allowed to hang downwards, and cauſing him to be a good deal jolted about, has on ſome occaſions anſwered when other means have failed.</p><p>The ſurgeon ſhould at the same time endeavour to aſſiſt the return of the bowels, by means of gentle preſſure with his hands and fingers. In the inguinal or ſcrotal hernia, this preſſure ſhould be made obliquely upwards and outwards to correspond with the opening in the external oblique muſcle; in the femoral hernia it ought to be made directly upwards ; in the Umbilical and ventral hernia directly backwards.—— The ſwelling ſhould be graſped with one hand at the bottom, while with the fingers of the other hand an attempt is made to puſh gently the contents of the tumor into their place, always obſerving that the parts laſt protruded be firſt reduced. This operation is by authors termed the <hi rend="italic">taxis.</hi></p><p>When the means now mentioned have failed, no remedy affords more relief than blood-letting. The quantity to be drawn ought chiefly to be determined by the ſtrength of the patient. There is ſcarcely any diseaſe, however, where ſuch large quantities of blood can with propriety be taken from weak people. Blooding till the patient is in a ſtate of deliquium animi, is frequently known to produce a more effectual relaxation of the muſcles than can be done by any other means. On that account it is ſometimes adviſed in caſes of hernia, and the practice is now and then attended with advantage.</p><p>As an obſtinate coſtiveneſs is commonly one of the most alarming ſymptoms of hernia, it has been a common practice to exhibit a variety of ſtimulating purgatives both by the mouth and anus ; but they are very ſeldom of much ſervice, and in that case almoſt universally do injury, by increasing not only the ſickneſs at ſtomach, but the tension and pain of the tumor. When they are to be employed, they ought to be thrown up by the anus. For this purpoſe aloes and other ſtimulating ſubſtances, but particularly tobacco- ſmoke, are employed ; and although this laſt remedy, which is to be thrown in by double bellows, &amp;c. does not always act as a purgative, it may be uſefully employed as an anodyne. Where an evacuation by ſtool is wanted, it may in general be readily procured by the injection of warm water, in which a little Caſtile ſoap is dissolved, in the proportion of a drachm or a drachm and a half of the latter to a pound of the former. Warm bathing is another remedy greatly extolled, either by general immersion of local application.<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0158.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0152"/>
            by means of warm water put into ox-bladders covered with flannel, and lard acroſs the abdomen.</p><p>To diminiſh the ſize of the tumor, remedies of an oppoſite quality from theſe have been uſed ; and though by ſome this practice has been conſidered as hazardous, yet by others, particularly by the late Dr Monro and Mr Benjamin Bell, more advantage has been found from cooling applications than from thoſe of a different nature. Snow, ice, or cloths dipped in a recent ſolution of ſal ammoniac in water and vinegar, or cold ſaturnine applications, or cold water and vinegar, have been employed with advantage. If, notwithſtanding theſe remedies, the diſeaſe becomes worſe, and no probability remains of ſucceſs, the diviſion of the parts producing the ſtricture can alone ſave the life of the patient.</p><p>To determine the exact time at which to proceed to an operation, has been conſidered as one of the niceſt points in ſurgery. In general, when every attempt has failed, and no repetition of the former remedies is likely to ſucceed, the ſurgeon ought certainly to proceed to the operation. A few hours, even when aſſiſtance has been early applied, is perhaps all the time which ought ever to be confirmed in trials of this nature. But however necessary this operation may be when a patient’s life is in danger, as it is always attended with ſome degree of hazard, it ought never to be practiſed where ſymptoms of ſtrangulation do not exiſt.</p><p>In that kind of hernia called <hi rend="italic">chronic,</hi> the circulation of the part forming the hernia, as well as the periſtaltic motion of ſuch parts of the alimentary canal as have been protruded, go freely and regularly on. There are many instances of large herniæ falling down even to the bottom of the ſcrotum, and continuing there for many years, without producing any interruption to the uſual diſcharge by ſtool. All that can be done here is, to prevent any accumulation of feces in the inteſtine, by preſcribing a proper diet, and the occaſional uſe of gentle laxatives ; and obviating any inconvenience which might ariſe from the weight of the tumor, by the application of a proper truſs or ſuſpenſary bandage ; to warn them of the riſk to which they are conſtantly liable, and to caution them againſt violent exerciſe, particularly leaping, and every sudden exertion. The truſs ought to be fitted exactly to the part for which it is intended, for without the utmoſt nicety in this reſpect, it muſt always do more harm than good : for the ſole purpoſe of a bandage, in caſes of hernia, is to prevent effectually the falling down of ſuch parts as have been newly replaced. If therefore the pad or bolſter of the bandage does not bear properly againſt the opening upon which it is placed, a portion of gut may slip out, and be materially injured by the pressure of the pad. Fig. 74. repreſents a truſs for an inguinal or femoral hernia of one side, fig. 75. a truſs for the same diſeaſe in both ſides, and fig. 76. a truſs for an umbilical hernia.</p><p>We ſhall now proceed to deſcribe the circumſtances to be attended to in performing the operation for hernia in general. A table of convenient ſize and height being placed in a proper light, the patient muſt be ſo laid on it as to relax the diſeaſed parts as much as poſſible, and then ſecured by proper aſſiſtance. To lessen the contents of the abdomen as much as poſſible, the bladder ought to be emptied previous to the operation. An inciſion is to be made with a common round-edged ſcalpel through the ſkin and part of the cellular ſubſtance, long enough to allow the ſtricture to be fully expoſed. The rest of the cellular ſubſtance is then to be divided with the greateſt attention. That part of the muſcle forming the ſtricture or ring muſt next be laid diſtinctly in view. A ſmall portion of the protruding ſac muſt alſo be expoſed ; after which the directory (fig. 73.) is to be paſſed between the ring and the ſac. A ſtraight probe-pointed ſcalpel is now to be introduced into the groove of the directory, and by it the ring is to be dilated till the point of the finger can be introduced. The finger is here conſidered as the ſafeſt director ; for it being insinuated into the aperture in the tendon immediately above the protruded parts, the point of the knife is eaſily introduced upon it ; and by keeping the end of the finger always a little before the knife, the opening may be enlarged to any neceſſary extent without riſk of wounding any of the contiguous parts.</p><p>By the eaſe with which the finger is introduced, the operator will be enabled to judge when the ring is sufficiently dilated ; and if the ſtrangulation was entirely in the ring, it will now be evident that every obſtacle to the reduction muſt be removed, and of conſequence that the prolapſed parts maybe returned with little difficulty. If the patient be young, or if the diſeaſe has continued a conſiderable time, ſuch a degree of inflammation frequently entues in the neck of the ſac as to produce thickening and ſtraitness ; ſo that, after the ſac and its contents have been entirely freed from the ſtricture of the ring, the inteſtines cannot be reduced. We judge this to be the case when, after the ſtricture of the ring has been removed, the parts prolapſed do not expand into their natural ſize, and farther, when they make reſiſtance when we attempt to return them. In this caſe, the neck of the ſac muſt be opened with the utmoſt caution, to avoid wounding the parts within it.</p><p>If the herniary ſac, under the ſtraitened place of its neck, be thin and tranſparent, and there is little or no reaſon to ſuſpect an adheſion of the bowels to the ſac, the beſt method, as Dr Monro, in his publication on the Bursae Mucosae, obſerves, will be to make a ſmall hole in the ſac below the ſtricture, and then to introduce a ſmall furrowed probe, and to cut cautiouſly upon it. But if the ſac be thick and dark coloured, and there is likewiſe a ſuſpicion that the bowels may adhere to it, the eaſieſt and ſafeſt manner will be to make the hole in the peritoneum above the ſtricture ; then to introduce a common probe, bent near its point into a ſemicircle, with its point directed downwards through the ſtricture into the ſac ; and upon the point of it to make, with great caution, another ſmall hole ; after which we may either cut upon the probe, or introduce a furrowed probe, and divide the neck of the ſac.</p><p>After this, the bowels are to be returned by pressure upon the ſac, without opening it farther ; and the ſides of the wound in the ſkin are to be brought together, and kept ſo by means of slips of adheſive plaſter, though ſtitches made at the diſtance of a finger-breadth from each other will exclude the air, and prevent the return of the bowels more effectually. Over theſe are to be laid ſeveral folds of charpee, and the whole is to be ſecured by a bandage adapted to the nature of the part.</p><p>The patient, upon being carried to bed, ſhould be ſo placed as to have the part upon which the operation was performed higher than the reſt of his body, or at leaſt as high as the ſituation of the part operated upon will allow, in order to prevent a return of the diſeaſe. After the operation, opiates are particularly uſeful, and ought to be repeated as circumſtances may require. It is likewiſe necessary that the patient be kept cool. In plethoric habits, blood lotting is proper, together with a rigid attention to low diet. A frequent uſe of clyſters and gentle laxatives, to keep the belly moderately open, ought not to be neglected. When the conſtitution has been previously much reduced, inſtead of blood letting and a low diet, a nouriſhing regimen is neceſſary. The dreſſings ought not to be removed till the third or fourth day after the operation, when the<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0159.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0153"/>
                sides of the wound will be found almoſt adhering together ; and if attention be paid to the ſubſequent treatment, the sore will be generally healed in two or three weeks. As ſoon as the wound is firmly cicatrized, a truſs ought to be properly fitted to the part, and ſhould never, on any future period of life, be laid aſide.</p><p>When the hernia is of long standing, and when there is reaſon to think adhesions have taken place between the ſac and bowels, or that mortification has already begun, or that ſome filaments run acroſs the ſac and prevent the reduction, or that there is water in the ſac, or that the gut is in danger of being entangled from a part of the omentum being down, a different method of operating becomes necessary.</p><p>The patient is to be placed as already directed. The operator is to graſp the tumor with the one hand, ſo as to make the ſkin tenſe on the fore part of it, while with the ſcalpel in the other he divides the ſkin from one end of the tumor to the other. The cellular ſubſtance is by gentle strokes to be divided, till not only the ring, but the whole length of the ſac, is laid bare. An opening is now, in the moſt cautious manner, to be made into the ſac by slight ſcratches, to avoid hurting any of its contents.</p><p>In making this perforation, which is conſidered as the niceſt part of the operation, conſiderable aſſiſtance is obtained from the uſe of the ſmall directory, upon the point of which the fibres of the ſac are to be ſucceſſively raised and divided till an opening is made. The opening is to be enlarged till it admit the fore-finger of the left hand, which ſerves as a directory for conducting the ſtraight probe- pointed ſcalpel with which the ſac is to be divided through its whole length.</p><p>The ſac being laid fully open, the parts contained in it ought to be examined with the niceſt attention, to diſcover whether they are all ſound or not ; and if, upon an attentive inspection, it is found that they are not evidently in a gangrenous ſtate, even although they ſeem conſiderably inflamed, they ſhould be immediately returned into the abdomen. When adhesions take place between different parts of the protruded gut, the greateſt caution is necessary in ſeparating them. When one part of a gut adheres ſo firmly to another as not to be ſeparated but with difficulty, it is much better to return the whole, even in that ſtate, into the abdomen, than to run the riſk of hurting the inteſtine materially by uſing much force. When adhesions occur between the hernial sac and the gut, or between the gut and omentum, if the filaments producing the connection cannot be otherwiſe removed, as there is no great hazard in wounding the omentum, and ſtill leſs in hurting the ſac, a very ſmall portion of theſe may be dissected, and returned with the gut into the abdomen. When the bowels cannot be reduced with eaſe, the ring is to be dilated by the blunt-pointed ſcalpel in the manner already directed. After returning the contents of the ſac into the cavity of the abdomen, it has been propoſed by ſome authors to paſs a ligature round the neck of the ſac, with a view of procuring a reunion of its ſides, ſo as to prevent a future deſcent of the bowels ; and various other methods, even actual and potential cauteries, have been propoſed : but as none of them yet attempted have been found ſufficiently to anſwer the purpoſe, the only thing that can be recommended is a well made truſs.</p><p>When the bowels are actually in a ſtate of gangrene, as the returning of ſuch mortified parts might be attended with the very worſt conſequences, a great degree of caution is necessary. When the omentum is found in a mortified ſtate, as the exciſion of a portion of this ſubſtance is not attended with much riſk, it is the common practice to cut away the diſeaſed parts, and to obviate any inconvenience which might enſue from the hemorrhagy. We are adviſed to make a ligature on the sound parts previous to the removal of thoſe which are mortified ; whilſt the ends of the ligature being left hanging out of the wound, the ſurgeon has it in his power to remove them when circumſtances appear to render it proper. Theſe ligatures on the omentum, however, are frequently productive of bad conſequences. No hemorrhagy of any importance ever occurs from a diviſion of this membrane, even in a ſound unmortified ſtate ; ſuch parts as have become gangrenous may therefore be freely cut off, and the remaining ſound parts be afterwards, without the intervention of ligatures, ſafely introduced into the abdomen. If a veſſel of any ſize in the omentum has been divided, a ligature may be passed above the veſſel itſelf, and the ends left hanging out of the wound ; the threads may be afterwards pulled away at pleaſure. When a rupture has been of long duration, it ſometimes happens, that from the pressure made by the truſs, and other circumſtances, portions of the omentum are collected together into hard lumps. If theſe be ſmall, they may be returned into the abdomen without producing any inconvenience ; but if from their bulk and hardneſs they are likely to do miſchief, they ought to be cut off. When part of the omentum is to be removed, it ought to be previouſly expanded and divided with ſcissars, which will be more convenient than any other instrument. When again a ſmall portion of gut is found mortified, we are to endeavour, by means of a needle-ligature, to connect the ſound part of the gut immediately above the mortified ſpot to the wound in the abdomen already made. By this means, when the mortified part ſeparates, or perhaps what is better, when it has been immediately cut out, the fæces are diſcharged by the wound ; and there are different inſtances where, after ſuch a diſcharge has continued for ſome time, the wound has entirely healed.</p><p>But when the mortified portion of gut is of conſiderable extent, and includes the whole circumference of the inteſtine, all that can be done is to remove it, and to draw, by means of a ligature, the upper end of the gut towards the under, and afterwards connect them to the inner edges of the wound. This at leaſt affords a chance of the ends of the gut being brought to reunite ; and if unfortunately that event ſhould not take place, a paſſage of the faeces will still be ſecured. All ſuch mortified parts as are to be removed ought to be cut off, and the remaining ſound intestine retained, before the opening in the ring can be dilated with ſafety, leſt the gangrenous portion slip in together with the ſound. The parts forming a hernia being all completely replaced, when the ſac in which they were contained is found thick, hard, and much enlarged, as in ſuch a ſtate no good ſuppuration can take place, and as its preſervation cannot be in any degree uſeful, ſuch parts of it as can be cut away with propriety ought to be removed. All the lateral and fore parts of the ſac may be cut off with ſafety ; but as it is commonly firmly connected with the ſpermatic vessels behind, this part of it ought not to be touched.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Of Bubonocele, or Inguinal and Scrotal Hernia.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> ſpecies of hernia is formed by a protruſion of ſome of the abdominal bowels through the rings of the external oblique muſcles.

When the hernia contains omentum only, the ſwelling is both more ſoft, compreſſible, and more unequal than when the gut alone is down ; the ſcrotum becomes more oblong than in the inteſtinal hernia ; and when the quantity of omentum is large, it is alſo much more weighty than a gut rupture of the ſame ſize ; but frequently the tu-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0160.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0154"/>

In the hernia humeralis also the inteſtines are unobſtructed, and the general ſymptoms of hernia are wanting. From the hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis teſtis, by the tumor generally feeling more ſmooth to the touch than in hernia, by the ſwelling here beginning in the under part of the ſcrotum and aſcending, by the ſpermatic cord being always free and diſtinct, and by a fluctuation being evident. From hydrocele of the ſpermatic cord, ſometimes with much difficulty, and therefore it requires here particular attention. In every case of tumor in the teſtes, where the moſt perfect certainty is not obtained, and when it is neceſſary to have recourſe to an operation, the ſurgeon ought to proceed as in a case of real hernia.</p><p>The treatment of bubonocele is the same with that already adviſed in the treatment of hernia in general, only making allowance for the ſituation of the diſeaſe. In attempting the reduction by means of the hand, the preſſure ſhould be obliquely upwards and outwards, correſponding with the ring of the abdominal muſcle. In performing the operation, the patient ſhould be laid on a table, with his head and body almoſt horizontal, whilſt at the same time his buttocks are ſomewhat elevated by pillows placed beneath them. The legs hanging over the edge of the table ought to be ſeparated, ſo as to admit the operator between them ; and ſhould in that ſituation be firmly ſecured by an aſſiſtant on each side, who ſhould take care to keep the thighs so far raiſed as to relax all the abdominal muſcles. The parts being previouſly ſhaved, an inciſion muſt be made with a common round-edged ſcalpel through the ſkin and part of the cellular ſubſtance, beginning at leaſt an inch above the ſuperior end of the tumor, and continuing it down to between two and three inches below the ring.</p><p>Although in by much the greateſt proportion of hernial ſwellings the ſpermatic vessels lie behind the protruded parts, yet on ſome occaſions they have been found on the anterior part of the tumor ; so that in order to avoid the risk of wounding them, as ſoon as the skin is divided, the remainder of the operation ought to be done in the moſt cautious manner, care being taken to avoid every large blood-veſſel which makes its appearance. The ring muſt now be laid diſtinctly in view ; a ſmall portion of the protruding sac muſt allo be expoſed; after which the directory is to be introduced between the ring and the ſac, placing the point of the inſtrument obliquely upwards and outwards. A blunt pointed biſtoury is now to be introduced into the groove of the directory, and by it the ring is to be dilated till the point of the finger can be introduced. The directory is now to be laid aſide, and the finger uſed in place of it through the reſt of the operation. After the operation is finiſhed, the dreſſings are to be applied, and the whole ſecured by a T bandage, or ſuſpenſory bag, properly ſtuffed with ſoft lint.</p><p>The patient, on being carried to bed, ſhould have a pillow under the buttocks, to elevate them a little above the reſt of the body, and ſhould be treated in the manner which has been already directed. As ſoon as the wound is firmly cicatrized, a truſs ought to be properly fitted and uſed through the reſt of the perſon’s life. Females are liable to this ſpecies of rupture as well as men ; and as the opening in the external oblique muſcles is exceedingly similar in both ſexes, the treatment of this ſpecies of hernia in females is very ſimilar to what is found to anſwer in men. When clyſters, blood-letting, and the other remedies formerly enumerated, fail, the same operation of enlarging the opening in the tendon of the oblique muſcle is here equally proper as in the other ſex.</p><p>As modeſt women are apt to conceal disorders of this kind, they may frequently happen when the ſurgeon receives no information about them. Whenever, therefore, ſuch ſymptoms of colic occur as give reaſon to ſuſpect the exiſtence of hernia, a particular examination ought always to be made, in order, if poſſible, to detect the cauſe of the miſchief, from the removal of which alone a cure can be expected.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Of Hernia Congenita.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> teſtes in the fœtus are, till near the time of delivery, lodged in the cavity of the abdomen. When they deſcend into the ſcrotum, they puſh before them a portion of the peritonaeum, which afterwards forms the vaginal coat. The paſſages by which they deſcend are ſoon ſhut up ; but ſometimes the contrary happens, and then a portion of ſome of the abdominal viſcera paſſing down, forms that ſpecies of hernia to which new-born infants are liable, termed by Haller the <hi rend="italic">hernia congenita.</hi> The teſticle and protruded inteſtine being here in contact with one another, the tunica vaginalis teſtis forms the hernial ſac.</p><p>It has been affirmed by ſome of the lateſt writers, that hernia congenita cannot be diſtinguiſhed from that contained in the common herniary ſac ; and that though there was a diſtinction, it could be of no material uſe in practice. But Dr Monro obſerves, that a hernia congenita may be diſtinguiſhed in an adult by an evident external mark ; which is, that the bowels puſh down between the ſac and the forepart and ſides of the teſticle, ſo as often in a great meaſure to conceal it ; whereas, in the common hernia, every part of the teſticle can be felt diſtinctly : And that it is of material uſe to make the diſtinction; because in whatever manner we operate in hernia congenita, unleſs we take the utmoſt care to exclude the air, there will be a more violent inflammation and greater diſtreſs than in common cases, becauſe the teſticle will partake of the inflammation.</p><p>In the treatment of ruptures of the congenital kind, little difference occurs from the management of the common scrotal hernia ; only a truſs ought never to be applied to infants, unleſs the teſticle can be felt in the ſcrotum, after the contents of the hernia have been reduced ; as it would entirely prevent the descent of the teſticle, which yet remains in the abdomen. If any operation has been performed, the teſticle ſhould, immediately after the bowels are reduced, be covered with the vaginal coat, and at each dreſſing care ſhould be taken that the air be excluded.

The diſeaſe is more frequent in women than in men, on account of the width of the female pelvis, and of consequence the length and laxity of the ligament. The femoral hernia is more in danger of being confounded with inguinal hernia than with any other ; the tumor, however, is deeper, and the ring of the abdominal muſcles, which lies entirely above the tumor in femoral hernia, completely surrounds the parts in that of the inguinal kind.</p><p>In the treatment of femoral hernia, when ſymptoms of ſtrangulation occur, we muſt uſe all the remedies commonly practiſed for hernia in general ; only that here, in attempting to reduce the parts by the hand, the preſſure ſhould be made directly upwards. An inciſion of sufficient length is to be made through the integuments, ſo as to allow that part of the tendon which forms the ſtricture to be laid fairly in view ; and after dividing the integuments, we are cautiouſly to cut the faſcia lata of the thigh, and ſeparate any glands which may come in the way till the ſtricture and part of the ſac diſtinctly appear. The ſtricture is then to be divided, by cutting fibre after fibre ſucceſſively. The ſpermatic veſſels in the male, or round ligament in the uterus in the female, may be avoided by cutting in a direction towards the umbilicus, carefully dividing the tendon tranſversely. Some authors, from a ſense of the danger attending this part of the operation, have recommended merely to dilate the paſſage, inſtead of dividing the tendon ; but in inch a ſituation, to attempt a farther dilatation without the aſſiſtance of the knife, would probably be seldom attended with any advantage. After the parts are reduced, the wound is to be dreſſed as directed in the treatment of hernia in general: a piece of thin leather ſpread with ſome adhesive plaſter retains the dreſſings better, and with much more ease, than any other bandage.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V. <hi rend="italic">Of other Species of Hernia.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> umbilical hernia the parts protruded paſs out at the umbilicus, and are commonly the inteſtines, or omentum, or both ; ſometimes part of the ſtomach, the liver, and even the ſpleen, have been found in the ſac. Here, as in other ruptures, the peritonæum forms the ſac, and in recent cases it is generally very evident ; but by the size of its contents, or a long continuance of the diſorder, it sometimes becomes ſo connected with the ſurrounding parts, that by many its exiſtence has been doubted, and ſometimes the ſwelling has increaſed to ſuch a degree as to burſt even the ſkin itſelf. The diſeaſe occurs moſt frequently in infancy, ſoon after birth. In the adult ſtate corpulent people are more subject to it than thoſe of a contrary habit ; and pregnant women are particularly ſubject to it, on account of the size of the uterus. The diagnosis in this diſeaſe is readily made, as the diſorder can scarcely be confounded with any other. If the diſeaſe be attended to in due time, a bandage properly fitted will generally effect a cure ; and in such swellings as Occur in pregnancy, delivery will commonly remove the disorder ; but even in cases of pregnant women, a bandage early applied and properly used will give considerable relief, till a cure can be obtained by delivery. In this diſeaſe the omentum is more frequently puſhed out than any other viſcus; hence umbilical herniæ in general are not productive of ſuch bad ſymptoms as uſually occur in the other kinds of rupture. When, however, the inteſtines protrude, the uſual ſymptoms of a ſtrangulated hernia are apt to be induced ; and when the means uſually employed for returning the gut into the abdomen do not ſucceed, a cure it is evident muſt depend entirely on a thorough removal of the ſtricture. In performing this operation, an inciſion through the integuments is the first ſtep to be taken, ſo as to expose the ſtricture of the tendon and the neck of the ſac. The ſtricture is to be removed in the manner already deſcribed ; and as the tendon completely ſurrounds the neck of the ſac, the ſtricture may be cut wherever it can be moſt readily dilated. A radical cure ſimilar to that for the other ſpecies has been propoſed, but with as little probability of ſucceſs.</p><p>Ventral rupture is a protrusion of ſome of the bowels through the interſtices of the abdominal muſcles, and is moſt frequently obſerved in ſome of the parts moſt contiguous to the linea alba. The treatment of this ſpecies of diſeaſe is exactly the ſame with that of exomphalos.</p><p>Hernia of the bladder of urine, though leſs frequent than that of the omentum or inteſtines, is not very uncommon. The ſituation in which it occurs is in the groin, through the abdominal ring, in the fore part of the thigh, under Poupart’s ligament, ſo as to form inguinal or crural hernia. Inſtances have likewiſe occurred of the bladder being puſhed into the perinæum. Sometimes it occurs by itſelf, without any complication; at other times it is accompanied with inteſtines and omentum, both in inguinal and femoral herniæ : when complicated with bubonocele, the protruded part of the bladder is ſituated between the inteſtine and ſpermatic cord.</p><p>The uſual ſymptoms are a tumor, attended with fluctuation either in the groin, in the fore part of the thigh, or perinæum, which generally ſubſides when the patient voids urine. When the ſwelling is large, before water can be made with freedom, it is commonly neceſſary to have recourſe to preſſure, at the ſame time that the tumor, when in the groin or thigh, is as much elevated as poſſible ; but when the ſwelling is ſmall, and eſpecially when no ſtricture is as yet produced, the patient generally makes water with great case, and without any aſſiſtance from external preſſure. When the diſeaſe occurs without any complication, it is commonly owing to a ſuppreſſion of urine. In the diagnoſis care ought to be taken not to miſtake it for a hydrocele. In recent cases, the part protruding may in general be eaſily reduced, eſpecially if we attend to the ſuppreſſion of urine, which probably gave riſe to the diſeaſe. A proper truss ought afterwards to be worn for a conſiderable time. When the diſeaſe has been of long ſtanding, adhesion takes place between the bladder and cellular ſubſtance of the ſcrotum. In this caſe, therefore, as long as no ſymptoms occur to render the operation neceſſary, a ſuſpenſory bandage, ſo fitted as effectually to ſupport the prolapſed parts, is the only probable means of relief.</p><p>Sometimes the bladder, owing to a ſuppreſſion of urine, at other times part of the inteſtines, have been found to protrude through the vagina. In the former caſe a fluctuation of water is perceptible to the touch.</p><p>The reduction is made by laying the patient on her back with her loins somewhat raised, and preſſing with the forefinger from the vagina. Deſcents may in future be generally prevented, by evacuating the urine often, and by the uſe of a peſſary introduced into the vagina. Nearly the ſame means are employed in reducing the inteſtine when it is found to protrude.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXIV. <hi rend="italic">Of Hydrocele.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Every</hi> tumor formed by a collection of water might with propriety be named <hi rend="italic">hydrocele,</hi> but the chirurgical acceptation of the term implies a watery ſwelling ſituated in the ſcrotum or ſpermatic cord.

A <hi rend="italic">naſarcous Hydrocele of the Scrotum.</hi></p><p>As ſoon as water has collected in any conſiderable quantity in the ſcrotum, a ſoft, inelaſtic, colourleſs tumor is obſerved over the whole of it ; impreſſions are eaſily received and retained for some time ; the ſkin at firſt preſerves its natural appearance, and the rugæ of the ſcrotum are not much altered ; but as the ſwelling advances, they gradually diſappear, and are at laſt totally obliterated. The ſwelling, from being at firſt ſoft, and of a conſiſtence ſimilar to dough, by degrees turns more firm, and the ſkin at laſt acquires an unnatural white ſhining appearance. The tumor at length becomes large ; and though originally confined to the ſcrotum, it at laſt ſpreads up the groin. The penis likewiſe becomes affected, and often so ſwelled and diſtorted as to excite much inconvenience and diſtreſs ; and although the ſcrotum is compoſed of parts which readily admit of dilatation, the tumor ſometimes becomes ſo enormous that it burſts from one end to the other.</p><p>In the ſurgical treatment of this diſeaſe punctures made with the point of a lancet are moſt adviſable, as large ſcarifications, in anaſarcous habits, are ſometimes apt to produce inflammation and mortification ; while simple punctures readily heal, and can be renewed with very little pain as frequently as may be necessary : and besides, punctures are equally uſeful with the incisions; for as the cells of the ſcrotum communicate freely, if the punctures be made fairly through the ſkin, the water drains off very readily, though not ſo ſoon as by ſcarification. Previous to the operation, beſmearing the part with ſome tough ointment of an innocent nature, and afterwards keeping it as dry as poſſible by a frequent renewal of dry ſoft linen cloths, in order to imbibe the moiſture, is here a necessary piece of attention. The want of this ſeems to be the cauſe of much of the miſchief which frequently enſues from operations of this kind. When ſcarifications or punctures go wrong by beginning to inflame and turn painful, &amp;c. a cold ſolution of ſaccharum faturni, applied upon ſoft linen, proves moſt effectual in putting a ſtop to the farther progreſs of the inflammation, and affords moſt immediate relief to the patient in the present diſtreſs. Lime water, employed in the ſame manner, proves alſo a very uſeful application. When, however, the diſorder proceeds to gain ground by a real mortification coming on, we ſhould immediately have recourſe to bark and other medicines uſually employed in ſuch affections.</p><p>Although the anaſarcous hydrocele, for the moſt part, depends upon a general dropsical tendency, ſome inſtances occur of a local cauſe producing a mere local dropſy of the ſcrotum. Thus, it has been known to happen from ſwellings in the groin and in the abdomen obſtructing the paſſage of the lymphatics. When this is the caſe, if tumors producing ſuch obſtructions can be extirpated, no other means will afford ſuch effectual relief; but when they are ſo deeply ſeated as to render any attempt for removing them improper, the practice we have already pointed out of making punctures in the moſt depending part of the tumor muſt be employed with a view to palliate ſuch ſymptoms as occur. It ſometimes happens in ſuppreſſion of urine, whether ariſing from ſtrictures in the urethra or from ſtones impacted in it, that the urethra burſts, and the urine in this manner getting acceſs to the cellular texture of the ſcrotum, an anaſarcous ſwelling rises immediately over the whole of it ; nor does it commonly diminiſh till the cauſe by which it is produced is removed.</p><p>In order to prevent the formation of ſinuſes, which in ſuch circumstances will otherwiſe be apt to occur, an inciſion ſhould be made into the tumor, and carried to ſuch a depth as is sufficient for reaching the wound in the urethra. In this manner a free vent will not only be given to the urine already diffuſed, but the farther collection of it may probably be prevented. If a ſtone impacted in the urethra be found to be the cauſe of effuſion, it ſhould be cut out ; and if the obſtruction be produced by ſtrictures in the urethra, they muſt be removed by a proper uſe of bougies The cauſe being thus removed, if the habit of body of the patient is good, and untainted with any venereal or other general affection, by dressing the ſore properly with ſoft eaſy applications, the opening into the urethra will probably heal, and a complete cure will in this manner be obtained. But when theſe ailments are complicated with any general affection, particularly with old venereal complaints, it frequently happens that neither mercury nor any other medicine has much influence in removing them.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Hydrocele of the Tunica Vaginalis Testis.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> the healthy ſtate of the body, a ſmall quantity of aqueous fluid is exhaled for lubricating the ſurface of the teſticle, the ſuperfluous part of which is abſorbed by vessels appointed for that purpoſe. When the ſecretion of this fluid is either morbidly increaſed, or its abſorption diminiſhed, a preternatural collection of water is formed in the cavity of the vaginal coat, and hydrocele of the vaginal coat produced.</p><p>The ſymptoms are, a fulneſs at firſt obſerved about the inferior parts of the teſticle, and moſt remarkable when the patient is erect, becoming gradually more tenſe as the diſeaſe advances ; the tumor by degrees changing from the globular to the pyramidical form; no degree of pressure making the ſwelling diſappear at any period of the diſeaſe. In the early part of the diſeaſe therefore, if it be not combined with hernia, or with a hydrocele of the cord, the ſpermatic proceſs may be diſtinctly felt, becauſe the ſwelling does not extend beyond the ſcrotum. In its more advanced ſtate, it cannot be diſtinguiſhed : the weight of the tumor now drags the ſkin of the neighbouring parts ſo much as to cauſe the penis almoſt to diſappear ; and in this ſtate of the diſeaſe the teſticle cannot be felt without much difficulty. On a minute examination, a hardneſs is always to be felt along that part of the ſcrotum where the teſticle is situated ; and at this point pressure excites ſome uneafineſs. Fluctuation of a fluid may in general be diſtinguiſhed through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe. In late ſtages, however, the appearance of a fluid is not very evident.</p><p>The tranſparency of the tumor has been generally suppoſed to be the principal criterion of this ſpecies of the diſorder ; but this muſt depend upon the nature of the contents, or thickneſs oſ the ſac ; ſo that, though the transparency of the tumor is a certain ſign of the exiſtence of water, its opacity cannot upon any account be conſidered as an indication of its abſence. Through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe the tumor is not attended with pain, but ſome uneasineſs is commonly felt in the back by the weight of the ſwelling of the ſpermatic cord. This is more particularly the caſe when a ſuſpenſory bandage is not uſed.</p><p>In the radical cure of hydrocele, in whatever way it is attempted, ſome degree of fever and inflammation will take place. Under the circumſtances mentioned in the prognoſis, the operation, if properly performed, is generally attended with the moſt complete ſucceſs. But if the patient be very old, infirm, and diſeaſed, an operation may be attended with ſuch a degree of inflammation, and conſequent ſup-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0163.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0157"/>
                                puration, as to be in danger of deſtroying a constitution already greatly impaired, and therefore ought not to be performed.</p><p>Various methods have been propoſed for the cure of hydrocele, all of which may be reduced to two general heads : Such as have in view only a temporary relief, and which is therefore termed the palliative cure ; and ſuch as are meant to effect a radical cure. When the tumor has become ſo large as to be inconvenient from its ſize, an evacuation of the water by ſurgical means becomes necessary. In this caſe, if the patient either refuſes to ſubmit to the operation for a radical cure, or if his ſtate of health render that operation improper, the palliative treatment, or a mere evacuation of the water by puncture, is the only means which can be employed.</p><p>A lancet-pointed trocar was many years ago recommened for drawing off the water in this manner by the preſent Dr Monro ; and ſince that time it has in an improved ſtate (fig. 77.), been recommended by Mr Andree ; another (fig. 78.) has been propoſed by Mr Bell. With any of theſe an opening may be made into the tunica vaginalis with ſafety.</p><p>The operator with one hand ſhould graſp the tumor behind, to press the contained fluid to the anterior and under part of it. If a round trocar is to be uſed, a puncture with a lancet ſhould be made where the trocar is to enter ; but where a flat trocar is to be employed, the aſſiſtance of the lancet is unnecessary.</p><p>As ſoon as the inſtrument has pierced the vaginal coat, the ſtilette ſhould be withdrawn, and the canula left in the ciſt. The water will now run off ; and if the tumor be not uncommonly large, it may be all drawn off at once ; but as the ſudden diſcharge of it, by taking off the ſupport, might be in danger of rupturing ſome of the veſſels, it ſhould be diſcharged by slow degrees. When the whole is evacuated, a piece of adheſive plaſter ſhould be immediately applied to the orifice ; and a compreſs of ſoft linen being laid over the ſcrotum, the whole ſhould be firmly supported with a ſuſpenſory bag (fig. 79.) or a T bandage. The patient in this ſtate being laid in bed, all kind of uneaſineſs is in a few minutes commonly gone, and he is able to follow his ordinary buſineſs without interruption.</p><p>The intention of every means now in uſe for the radical cure of this ſpecies of the diſeaſe, is to induce ſuch a degree of inflammation on the parts in which it is ſcated as may obliterate entirely the cavity of the tunica vaginalis, by making it adhere to the ſurface of the teſticle. The means at preſent generally employed for effecting a cure are, exciſion of the tunica vaginalis; the application of cauſtic ; the uſe of a ſeton ; a ſimple inciſion of the ſac ; and the injecting of acrid liquors into the tunica vaginalis, after drawing off the fluid which it contained. The method of cure, by the removal of the vaginal coat, is, firſt to lay open the vaginal coat, and then to cut it away by different ſnips of a pair of ſcissars. The ſac being removed, the parts are to be dressed and treated in the ſame manner as in the operation where ſimple inciſion is uſed.</p><p>The cure by cauſtic is attempted in the following manner : The ſcrotum being ſhaved, a piece of common paſte cauſtic, properly ſecured with adheſive plaſter, is applied, of about a finger’s breadth, the whole length of the tumor ; and if, on removing the cauſtic, it has not penetrated into the vaginal coat, an opening is made in it with a ſcalpel, ſo as to evacuate the contents, lay bare the teſticle, and admit of proper dreſſings. But Mr Elſe, one of the lateſt writers in favour of the method of cure by cauſtic, says, that there is no neceſſity for ſuch an extenſive application of cauſtic as many have recommended ; that an eschar of the ſize of a shilling is ſufficient; that this may be always fully obtained by the application of cauſtic paſte of the ſize of a ſixpence, which is to be laid on the anterior and under part of the ſcrotum, and to be properly ſecured by plaſter, in order to prevent it from ſpreading. The cauſtic commonly produces all its effects in five or six hours, and may then be removed. At this time digeſtives, or an emollient poultice, muſt be applied over the ſcrotum, and the whole ſuspended with a bandage. Inflammation, Mr Elſe obſerves, is ſoon induced over the whole tunica vaginalis ; and the febrile ſymptoms which ſucceed, he adviſes to be kept moderate by bloodletting, injections, emollient poultices, and a low regimen. In a few days the eſchar of the ſcrotum ſeparates, and comes away ; and in a gradual manner, in the courſe of four, five, or six weeks, the whole tunica vaginalis comes off, when the wound for the moſt part ſoon heals, and a complete cure is obtained.</p><p>Where it is intended to treat hydrocele by means of a ſeton, it may be done in the following manner : An opening is made with a ſcalpel, or the ſharp-pointed biſtoury, in the ſuperior part of the tumor, large enough to admit with eaſe a thick cord of common white ſewing ſilk. A director, with an eye at one end, in which the cord is inſerted, is introduced at this opening ; and its farther extremity being carried down to the moſt depending part of the tumor, an opening is there made, of about half an inch in length, by cutting upon the director with the biſtoury ; the director being now drawn till a ſufficient quantity of ſilk is left hanging out below, the operation is in this manner finiſhed.</p><p>Another very ſimple method of introducing a ſeton is by means of a ſilver canula and perforator.</p><p>In the operation for a radical cure by inciſion, the patient being laid upon a table of convenient height, and properly ſecured by aſſiſtants, with the ſcrotum lying nearly on the edge of the table, the operator with one hand ſhould graſp the tumor behind, ſo as to keep it firm and make it ſomewhat tenſe anteriorly : With a common round edged ſcalpel in the other hand, he ſhould now divide the external integuments by one continued inciſion from the upper to the under end of the tumor. An opening is next to be made in the vaginal coat with a large lancet, or a ſharp pointed biſtoury (fig. 80.), at the upper end of the firſt inciſion. This opening ſhould be of ſuch a ſize as freely to receive the finger of the operator, which is to conduct a blunt pointed biſtoury, ſo as to divide the ſac down to its bottom, which is conſidered as being of advantage, by preventing partial adheſions and the riſk of a return of the diſeaſe.</p><p>The inciſion being completed, the teſticle is now brought fully into view ; and if the tunica vaginalis be found, the dreſſing may be finiſhed immediately. But if the ſac be diſeaſed, it is to be removed, which may be readily accompliſhed by a ſcalpel or biſtoury.</p><p>When the hydrocele, as ſometimes happens, affects both ſides at the ſame time, if, when the operation is done on one side, an opening be made into the vaginal coat of the oppoſite side, at the upper part, through the ſeptum ſcroti, and the inciſion carried down to the bottom of the tumor, the ciſt can be equally well laid open, the water as completely evacuated, and a return of the disease as much prevented, as when the operation is done in the uſual manner, and at different times.</p><p>In whichever way the inciſion is made, if the teſticle be found, the wound ought to be quickly dressed ; for it is found, that on this much of the succeſs of the operation depends. For if the vaginal coat be merely applied to the teſticle, or united by futures, as ſome have adviſed, partial adheſions are apt to take place, before a degree of inflammation is produced over the whole ſufficient for making a<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0164.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0158"/>
                                    complete cure. In this manner cavities are left, which either fill with pus during the cure, and require to be laid open, or they afterwards give rise to collections of water, and thereby occaſion a return of the diſeaſe. The practice of fluffing the cavity of the ſore with dreſſings is alſo a frequent cause of miſchief, by exciting too great a degree of inflammation in the part. But when the dreſſings are properly managed, ſymptoms of violence almoſt never occur. The lateſt authors adviſe, that in dreſſing the parts after the operation, two pieces of lint or ſoft old linen are to be dipped in oil, or in a liniment of wax and oil, and then, by the help of a probe, are to be inferred into the bottom of the ſac on each side of the teſticle, leaving a sufficient quantity of the pledgets hanging out of the wound, ſo as to admit of being easily withdrawn at the first or second dressing. The edges of the wound are next to be dreſſed with pledgets of cerate, and the ends of the oiled pledgets turned over on each side. Several pieces of ſoft lint are then to be laid over the wound, and theſe ſhould be more or leſs numerous in proportion to the heat of the ſeaſon. A compreſs of linen is now to be laid over the whole, and the dreſſings ſupported by a T bandage or ſuſpenſory bag properly fitted. The patient is then to be carried to bed ; an anodyne ſhould be given, eſpecially if there be much pain ; and he ought to be adviſed to lie as much as poſſible upon his back for a few days after the operation.</p><p>In the third or fourth day after the operation, all the dreſſings, except thoſe between the teſticle and tunica vaginalis, are to be removed ; and if this cannot be done readily, as the parts are otherwise apt to become uneaſy, a ſponge dipped in warm water ſhould be applied. On ſome occasions, at the first dreſſing, and always at the ſecond or third, the pledgets inſerted between the tunica vaginalis come away ; and whenever this happens, they ſhould be renewed. It is alſo proper to renew them daily for the first fourteen or fifteen days after the operation ; not however of the same depth as the first, for during the latter part of the cure they need only to be inſerted as far as to prevent the divided edges of the tunica vaginalis from adhering to the teſticle, before the adheſive process has taken place in the parts more deeply ſeated. Particular attention however is necessary to this part of the treatment ; for when the diſeaſe returns, it has been found to be chiefly owing to the edges of the vaginal coat being allowed to adhere to the teſticle, before adheſion had taken place between the deeper parts.</p><p>A complete adheſion of the two coats of the teſticle, the tunica vaginalis, and tunica albuginea, takes place moſt frequently about the third week after the operation. Previous to this time, inflammation continuing gradually to increaſe, the tumor becomes larger till it acquire ſomewhat of the ſize of a ſwelled testicle from gonorrhoea ; but after this period it gradually ſubſides, and the ſore produced by the inciſion, and now reduced to a line, heals in ſome time between the fourth and eight week, according to the habit of body, age of the patient, and other circumſtances.</p><p>Having thus given an account of the methods uſually employed in the cure of hydrocele, we ſhall now make a few observations on the comparative advantages of the three last. From the teſtimony of many authors of credit, it is evident, that any of theſe methods, in moſt inſtances, prove effectual ; but every practitioner being apt to be prejudiced in favour of a particular method, he generally continues to follow that mode and no other ; and finding it commonly ſucceed, be by degrees perſuades himſelf, that other methods of cure, with which he has not had ſuch opportunities of becoming acquainted, are liable to objections, which thoſe who have practiſed them do not find to be the caſe. The reſult of Mr B. Bell’s obſervations upon this ſubject is, that although all the three modes of operating, by cauſtic, the ſeton, and ſimple inciſion, are perhaps equally capable of producing a radical cure ; yet, that of the three, the latter, viz. the mode by the ſimple inciſion, is liable to feweſt objections, and effects a cure, both with leaſt trouble to the operator and leaſt risk to the patient : and of the other two, the treatment by cauſtic appears to be the beſt. He has ſeen all the three produce troubleſome ſymptoms, ſuch as, pain and tenſion of the abdomen, inflammation, and fever ; but heſitates not to say, that the ſeton is more frequently productive of theſe effects than any of the other methods.</p><p>Besides the methods already mentioned, another has been lately revived, viz. the injecting of irritating liquors into the vaginal coat of the testicle. This method is particularly deſcribed by a Monſieur Lambert of the laſt century, and may be of much older date for any thing which is known to the contrary. From ſome cause or other it ſeems to have been entirely laid aſide till about the middle of the preſent century, when it was practiſed by Mr Monro (afterwards a phyſician-general in the West Indies), under the sanction of the late Dr Monro, and favourably received and followed by some of the first ſurgeons of this place. But in general, though the cure appeared complete, the diſeaſe returned.</p><p>The preference is uſually given to wine, and commonly that is somewhat diluted ; but where no pam is excited by the injection, the liquor ſhould be diſcharged, and a ſtronger one used. For where no pain takes place, a cure is not to be expected.</p><p>The following is the moſt approved method of performing the operation : The operator ſhould be provided with a flat trocar and canula, and with a bag of reſina elaſtica, fitted with a ſtop-cock and pipe, which ought exactly to suit the canula. See fig. 81.</p><p>The patient being laid in an horizontal poſture, either upon a bed or a table, the water ſhould be drawn entirely off from the tumor by a flat trocar paſſed into the under and fore part of it. The operator ſecuring the canula with the one hand, is with the other to pals the tube of the injection-bag fairly through it, and with gentle pressure to force in as much of the liquid as may reach the whole ſurface of the vaginal coat, as well as the whole ſurface of the teſticle. The bag ſhould now be removed, leaving the tube within the canula of the trocar, so that by turning the ſtop- cock the injection may be retained in the cavity of the tumor. The canula of the trocar ought ſtill to be kept fixed, otherwise it might recede, by which the liquid would inſinuate into the cellular ſubſtance of the ſcrotum. The liquor ſhould likewiſe be brought into contact with every part of the cavity; and after remaining about four, or at the moſt five, minutes in the ſac, it ſhould be entirely diſcharged through the canula of the trocar, after withdrawing the tube of the elaſtic bag.</p><p>Sometimes intenſe pain is felt immediately after the liquor is thrown in. When this is the caſe, it ſhould be diſcharged as ſoon as it has paſſed over the different parts of the tunica vaginalis. Some recommend a repetition of the same kind of injection immediately after the first has been diſcharged, and to be retained for the same period, though this is not commonly practiſed.</p><p>The whole of the injection ſhould be completely diſcharged, after which the ſcrotum ſhould be covered with a pledget of cerate, a compreſs being applied over it, and retained with a suspensory bag. The patient ought to be in bed for ſeveral days, and ſupport the ſcrotum in the bandage by means of a ſmall pillow.</p><p>Though it is difficult to aſcertain the proportion of thoſe<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0165.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0159"/>

The cauſes of this diſeaſe may be, obſtructions in the lymphatics leading from the part in conſequence of ſcirrhous affections of the abdominal viſcera, or the preſſure of a truſs applied for the cure of hernia.</p><p>When the affection is connected with anaſarca in other parts, it is then ſo evident as to require no deſcription. When it is local, it is attended with a colourleſs tumor in the courſe of the ſpermatic cord, ſoft and inelaſtic to the touch, and unaccompanied with fluctuation. In an erect poſition of the body it is of an oblong figure ; but when the body is recumbent, it is flatter and ſomewhat round. Generally it is no longer than that part of the cord which lies in the groin, though ſometimes it extends as far as the teſticle, and even ſtretches the ſcrotum to an uncommon ſize ; an inſtance of which is related by Mr Pott, who from a ſwelling of this kind diſcharged 11 Engliſh pints at once. By preſſure a great part of the ſwelling can always be made to recede into the abdomen. It inſtantly, however, returns to its former ſituation on the preſſure being withdrawn.</p><p>When the tumor is connected with general anaſarca of the ſyſtem, it can only be cured along with the rest of the diſeaſe ; but when the ſwelling is local, the remedy is also to be locally applied. An inciſion is to be made of ſuch a ſize as may be ſufficient for diſcharging the whole of the water ; in the performance of which, attention is necessary to guard againſt hurting the ſpermatic veſſels. The contents of the tumor being diſcharged, the ſore is to be treated like any other simple wound.</p><p>Encyſted hydrocele of the ſpermatic cord ſometimes begins in the upper, but generally at the lower part of the ſpermatic cord. On its firſt appearance it is ſo ſmall as to give little or no trouble ; hence it is ſeldom particularly attended to till it has acquired a conſiderable ſize. By degrees it extends as far as the abdominal muſcles, and ſometimes reaches to the bottom of the ſcrotum; and to a person unacquainted with the appearance of the diſorder may be miſtaken for a hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis. But here the tumor is always above the teſticle, which is diſtinctly felt below ; and even in the advanced ſtate of the diſeaſe the teſticle is found in the back part of it perfectly unconnected with the ſwelling ; whereas, in the advanced ſtages of hydrocele in the vaginal coat, although ſome hardneſs is diſcovered where the tunica vaginalis adheres to the testicle, yet when the ſwelling is great the teſticle cannot be distinctly felt. In the encyſted hydrocele of the cord, the figure and ſize of the penis is little altered ; whereas, in caſes of common hydrocele, the penis frequently diſappears almoſt entirely. In other respects the two diſeaſes are nearly ſimilar. It ſometimes happens that the water is contained in two diſtinct cells. In that caſe the tumor is ſomewhat puckered up, or diminiſhed in its diameter. A ſimilar appearance alſo occurs, when this variety of the diſeaſe is connected with hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis, which ſometimes takes place.</p><p>The only other tumors with which this one may be confounded are, the anasarcous hydrocele of the ſpermatic cord, and a real hernia. But in neither of theſe is the fluctuation of a fluid perceptible, and to the touch they are both ſoft and inelaſtic ; whereas, in this variety of hydrocele, the tumor has a ſpringy feel, and a fluctuation is ſenſible to the touch ; and in both the one and the other the ſwelling recedes ſomewhat upon preſſure, which it never does here.</p><p>From hernia it is chiefly diſtinguished by the tumor beginning ſome way down the cord. In hernia the tumor turns leſs when the patient is in an horizontal poſture, and is conſiderably affected by coughing and ſneezing ; but this kind of hydrocele is not altered in ſize by any ſuch circumſtances, nor has it the common ſymptoms which attend a hernia.</p><p>Infants are frequently ſubject to this diſeaſe, as well as to an anaſarcous ſwelling of the cord, and an œdematous tumor of the ſcrotum. But here the complaint is ſeldom permanent ; for in moſt inſtances it readily yields to gentle friction, with any ſtimulating or aſtringent application, as a ſtrong ſolution of ſal ammoniac in vinegar, &amp;c. But in adults, the ciſt, in every variety of encyſted hydrocele, becomes ſo firm as not to be affected by external applications; ſo that when the tumor becomes large, it is neceſſary to uſe means for producing either a palliative or radical cure, in the same manner as is done for a hydrocele in the vaginal coat.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV. <hi rend="italic">Of Haematocele Scroti.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi> ſhall mention in this place the diſeaſe called ha <hi rend="italic">matocele scroti,</hi> which is occaſioned by blood extravalated in the inner ſubſtance of the ſcrotum, in the tunica vaginalis, or in the ſpermatic cord but the uſual ſituation is in the tunica vaginalis teſtis.</p><p>Tumors of this kind may be produced by any thing which ruptures the blood veſſels of the part, but they are commonly the conſequence of external violence.

In ſuch a caſe, we are commonly informed of the accident by blood being diſcharged along with the water ; though ſometimes it does not appear till the whole of the water is evacuated, and then a tumor of a conſiderable ſize ſuddenly takes place. Sometimes it happens where the quantity of water has been ſo uncommonly great that the hidden dilcharge of it, by taking away the ſupport which the veſſels have been accuſtomed to receive, has been the cauſe of their rupture ; and it ſeems certain, that whenever a tumor is produced either in the ſcrotum or cord ſuddenly after the water of a hydrocele has been evacuated by tapping, that it is entirely owing to an extravaſation of blood.</p><p>In the ſpermatic cord injuries of the same kind will be attended with a ſimilar effect upon the veſſels of the ſac containing the water. The diſtinction between blood and water in the ſubſtance of the ſcrotum is readily made by the colour ; for where the diſeaſe is produced by blood, it forms a real eſchymoſis. The tumor feels heavier in the tunica vaginalis when filled with blood than where it is filled merely with water; the treatment is nearly the same with that in hydrocele. In the commencement of the anasarcous or diffuſed hæmatocele, when produced from slight external violence, the application of ſtimulating or aſtringent fluids will ſometimes diſcuſs it ; but if this prove ineffectual, the tumor is to be laid open, and treated exactly as was directed for hydrocele ; only if a ruptured veſsel be diſcovered, it muſt be ſecured by ligature.

Sometimes, however, theſe cannot be detected ; an oozing takes place which it is difficult to reſtrain, even by the uſe of bark, vitriolic acid, and other means generally employed in ſuch caſes. It has been uniformly found, that local remedies prove chiefly uſeful here, particularly the application of ardent ſpirits, sether, or tincture of myrrh, to the ſurface of the ſore. Pledgets of ſoft lint, ſoaked in one or other of theſe, not only ſerve to check the diſcharge of blood, but in general tend to promote the formation of good matter.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXV. <hi rend="italic">Of Varicocele, Circocele, Spermatocele, and Pneumatocele.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Varicocele</hi> is a preternatural diſtenſion of the veins of the ſcrotum, which in this ſtate form a tumor of hard, knotty inequalities, ſeldom painful, and generally attended with no inconvenience excepting what ariſes from its bulk. Circocele is ſimilar in its nature to the former, but ſituated in the ſpermatic cord, extending from the abdominal ring to the superior part of the ſcrotum, and produced by a varicoſe ſtate of the ſpermatic vein. Both of theſe diſorders are occaſionally produced by obſtruction in the veins; but are moſt frequently owing to a relaxed ſtate of theſe vessels ; to which we may add, that on account of the ſmallneſs of the corresponding artery, they are not ſufficiently affected by its influence. The tumor produced by theſe diſorders is ſometimes ſo large as to appear like a hernia or hydrocele; but we diſtinguiſh it from theſe by the touch, for varicoſe veins are like worms filled with elaſtic matter. We have another mark upon which we can ſtill more depend : The tumor in the erect poſture of the body is much increaſed, while in the horizontal ſituation it almoſt entirely diſappears.</p><p>Another diſorder is obſerved by late authors, where a collection of blood is ſometimes found within the tunica albuginea teſtis, and is ſuppoſed to be a kind of hæmatocele, er more probably varicocele. Sometimes the collection is ſo conſiderable, that a fluctuation reſembling that of an hydrocele of the vaginal coat of the teſticle is obſervable. When this is miſtaken for hydrocele, and an opening is made into it with a trocar, a diſcharge is produced of a duſky-coloured blood, ſomewhat reſembling thin chocolate : But though the tumor may be diminiſhed by the evacuation thus obtained, yet the alteration is inconſiderable ; nor is the patient ever relieved, but on the contrary made worſe by ſuch an operation. Caſtration, after this, becomes necessary ; but even this has been found ineffectual : ſo that the patient had better be adviſed to truſt to nature, aſſiſted by a proper ſuſpenſory bandage, than to ſuffer the attempt of a radical cure ; for it has been obſerved, that in ſome inſtances they have remained ſtationary for many years, whereas they never fail to become much worſe by any attempt to evacuate the fluid.</p><p>When tumors, er the pressure of a truſs, has been the cauſe of ſuch complaints, a proper attention to theſe ought to be the firſt attempt towards a cure. But when a relaxed ſtate of the veins is ſuſpected, we ought to recommend a ſuſpenſory bandage, an horizontal poſture, the cold bath, and the application of a ſolution of alum and other aſtringents. By a proper exhibition of theſe, the diſeaſe may at leaſt be prevented from increaſing, ſo as to render any operation unneceſſary.</p><p>By ſpermatocele is underſtood a morbid diſtenſion of the vas deferens and epidydimis. The diſeaſe may ariſe from tumors, ſtricture, or inflammation about the vas deferens, or its termination in the penis ; but more probably from inflammation there. When an inflammatory dispoſition is diſcovered, general and topical blood letting, gentle laxatives, a low cooling diet, and reſt of body, will commonly be found the best remedies. When tumors are found to preſs upon the vas deferens, they ought either to be brought to a ſtate of ſuppuration, or entirely extirpated, if that can be properly effected. If the diſeaſe proceed from a venereal cauſe, nothing can be ſo uſeful as a courſe of mercury properly directed.</p><p>By pneumatocele is underſtood a diſtenſion of the ſcrotum from a collection of air.</p><p>The principal cauſe of this diſeaſe, which rarely happens, is wounds in the lungs, by which air passes through the common cellular ſubſtance into the ſcrotum ; but from whatever cauſe the tumor is produced, the diſeaſe is to be treated by making ſmall punctures with the point of a lancet, as in the case of anaſarcous ſwellings formed by water.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXVI. <hi rend="italic">Of Sarcocele, or Scirrhous Testicle.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sarcocele</hi> implies a fleſhy, enlarged ſtate of the testicle, much firmer and harder to the touch than is obſerved in hernia humeralis or inflamed teſticle.</p><p>The ſymptoms vary exceedingly in different patients ; but the following are the moſt general : The firſt symptom is commonly a ſmall enlargement, without much pain, and no diſcoloration of the part. The tumor becomes gradually larger, and the hardneſs increaſes; but for a considerable time the ſurface remains ſmooth ; and when the conſtitution is otherwiſe good, the diſorder will ſometimes remain in this ſituation for a conſiderable number of years ; and in a few rare inſtances, by a moderate diet, keeping the belly open, ſuſpending the tumor properly, and avoiding violent exerciſe, or any thing which may conſiderably increaſe the impetus of the blood, the diſorder has not only been prevented from increaſing, but has in a gradual manner diſappeared entirely. More commonly, however, the tumor increaſes in ſize, and becomes ragged and unequal on its ſurface. Smart and ſevere ſhooting pains are frequently felt through its ſubſtance. Sometimes ſerum is extravaſated in the vaginal coat, or matter is collected in different parts of the tumor. The ſcrotum, now much distended, burſts, and thin, fetid, bloody matter diſcharging, the diſeaſe terminates in an ulcerated cancer of the worſt kind.</p><p>The ſpermatic cord is commonly unaffected till the tumor has acquired a conſiderable ſize, and generally not till collections of matter have been formed. After this, from being at firſt only ſlightly ſwelled, it gradually increaſes in hardneſs and bulk ; after which it becomes very painful, knotty, or unequal through its whole extent. The diſcharge from the ſcrotum ſtill continues ; but although the matter increaſes in quantity, the ſize of the tumor is not thereby diminiſhed, but, on the contrary, continually increaſes ; the edges of the ſore become hard, livid, and retorted, and fungous excreſcences puſh out from every part of it ; the health of the patient becomes entirely deſtroyed, and he is at laſt carried off in great miſery.</p><p>Hernia humeralis produced by venereal infection has been conſidered, by ſome authors, as a frequent cauſe of the worſt kind of ſcirrhous teſticle ; but the fact is very much otherwiſe ; and ſuch an idea has this bad tendency, that it prevents the perſeverance in the uſe of ſuch remedies as might have removed the diſeaſe without the neceſſity of extirpation.</p><p>Another cauſe mentioned by authors as producing<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0167.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0161"/>
                                                ſcirrhus of the teſticle, is the hydrocele of the vaginal coat ; but though ſarcocele is frequently combined with this diſeaſe, there is every reaſon to think that the primary diſorder was in the teſticle itſelf, and that the water is only a conſequence of the other complaint. When the hydrocele happens to be the original diſeaſe, the teſticle is also found frequently altered in its appearance. lt is here paler than in its natural ſtate. It is ſometimes diminiſhed, but more frequently enlarged. The enlargement however is ſoft, harmleſs, and free from pain ; and in such a ſituation ſhould never be extirpated. To this point particular attention ought to be paid, otherwiſe we run the riſk of committing a miſtake, into which practitioners have been too frequently led—the extirpation of a teſticle which ought to have been laved. To keep free of this error, we ought to attend to the following circumſtances.</p><p>When the diſeaſe begins in the teſticle itſelf, eſpecially in the body or glandular part, or when it becomes hard and enlarged previous to any collection of water in the vaginal coat, it is to be conſidered as of a different nature from that in which an enlargement of the part ſucceeds to a collection of water ; or if, upon evacuating the water, the teſticle be found hardened, enlarged, and attended with pain and other marks of ſcirrhus, eſpecially if the ſurface be unequal or ulcerated, extirpation ought certainly to be performed. The ſymptoms above mentioned ſometimes, though rarely, begin in the epidydimis. In ſuch caſes, however, extirpation will ſeldom be adviſable, as there is here always a ſuſpicion of a venereal affection ; and then we ought by all means to try the remedies commonly uſed in ſuch diſeaſes. In the prognoſis, we attend to the age and habit of the body, as well as to the ſtate of the diſeaſe and length of time it has continued.</p><p>When the patient is young and the conſtitution unbroken, we may always hope for a cure, although the ſymptoms ſhould be very considerable ; whereas, in old infirm people, and in habits attended with an emaciated look, with indigeſtion, and other ſymptoms of obſtructed viſcera, whatever ſtate the diſeaſe may be in, there will be but a ſmall chance of success.</p><p>If the diſeaſe has ſubſiſted for a long time without considerably increaſing in ſize, we may reaſonably think it is of a milder nature than where it has made a rapid progress. As long as the teſticle is only hard and free from the formation of matter, we may expect a favourable event ; but where collections of matter have already formed, either in the ſubſtance or upon the ſurface of the testicle, there is no other chance of ſaving the patient than by means of extirpation. Previous to this, however, we are to attend to the ſtate of the ſpermatic cord ; for were any of it left in a diſeaſed ſtate, little advantage could be derived from extirpation ; nor ought the operation ever to be performed but where we can reach the whole of the diſeaſed parts. We are not to be prevented from performing it though the cord ſhould be considerably enlarged, providing it do not evidently partake of the diſeaſe of the teſticle ; for the cord is generally ſomewhat enlarged in the diſeaſed ſtate of the teſticle ; but this enlargement is for the most part merely either a varicoſe ſtate of the veins, or a watery diſpoſition of the cellular ſubſtance.</p><p>But ſuppoſing no obſtacle to the operation, the method of doing it may be this. The parts being previouſly ſhaved, the patient is to be laid upon a ſquare table of about three feet four inches high, letting his legs hang down ; which, as well as the rest of his body, must be held firm by afliſtants ; or, he may be laid acroſs a bed in the ſame manner. Then with a knife the inciſion is to be begun above the rings of the abdominal muſcles, that there may be room afterwards to ſecure the veſſels ; then carrying it through the membrana adipoſa, it must be continued downward to the bottom of the ſcrotum. A firm, waxed, flat ligature, compoſed of ſmall threads, is next, by means of a curved needle, to be paſſed round the ſpermatic cord, at leaſt an inch above the diſeaſed part, or as near the abdominal ring as poſſible ; after which the vesſels are to be secured by a running knot, and divided about a quarter or half an inch below the ligature. The cord and teſticle are then to be removed from the ſurrounding parts by diſſecting from above downwards, and no infiniment is better for this purpoſe than the common ſcalpel. After the diſeaſed parts are removed, the knot upon the cord muſt be ſlackened to diſcover the ſpermatic arteries and veins ; both of which, by means of the tenaculum or a common forceps, are to be taken up. The ligature upon the ſpermatic cord is now to be left looſe, ſo as to act as a tourniquet if a hemorrhagy ſhould enſue ; nor is there more occaſion for leaving the ligature tied than for leaving a tourniquet firmly applied to one of the extremities after amputation ; beſides, where patients have ſuffered ſuch pain as is ſometimes mentioned by authors, it has been found to be owing to the tightneſs of the ligature rather than to any other cauſe. In dividing the ligatures of the blood- veſſels at the extremities of the cord, they muſt be left of ſuch a length without the wound as to be readily removed, however much the cord may retract in the time of the cure.</p><p>In ſeparating the teſticle, a conſiderable hemorrhagy ſometimes enſues from the diviſion of the ſcrotal arteries. In ſuch a case, they ought always to be fixed with ligatures before proceeding in the operation. The parts being removed, and the blood-vessels ſecured, the wound is to be cured, if poſſible, by the firſt intention ; and for this purpoſe the sides of the ſcrotum are to be brought together in the moſt accurate manner, beginning at the under end, and ſecuring the parts by adheſive plaſter as we proceed upwards, and in ſuch a way that the ſides of the ſore may be kept properly together. About two inches of the ligatures of the cord are to be left out, and this part of the wound treated in the ſame manner as the reſt ; the whole to be ſecured by a compreſs of linen and a T bandage.</p><p>The patient ſhould now be laid to reſt, and an opiate adminiſtered ; and if, upon the ſecond or third day, any inflammatory ſymptoms enſue, they are to be removed by methods commonly employed upon theſe occaſions ; as, topical blood letting, gentle laxatives, and keeping the part conſtantly moiſt with a ſolution of ſugar of lead. The dreſſings ought not to be allowed to ſhift, elſe the cure will be greatly retarded. They are to be examined about four or five days arter the operation ; and if nothing material has happened, they may be allowed to remain two or three days longer, by which time generally the ligature can be readily removed ; and the wound will be healed by the firſt intention, excepting ſome ſmall opening in the skin, more eſpecially where the ligatures were placed. Theſe are to be drawn together by adhesive ſtraps, and dreſſed in the ſame manner as formerly. In this way, if the patient be otherwiſe healthy, a cure may be expected in little more than a fortnight</p><p>The method of dreſſing moſt frequently practiſed is to apply a quantity of ſoft lint to the sore, and then a compress of linen over it, and to ſecure the whole with a T bandage or a suſpenſory bag. The patient is then laid to reſt, and an opiate given. The ſore is not to be touched till a free ſuppuration takes place, which will commonly be<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0168.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0162"/>
                                                    about the fifth or ſixth day, and then the dreſſings are to be removed, and renewed from time to time ; once every two days, or oftener, as the quantity of matter may render it necessary. Sometimes after the operation the patient complains of pain in the ſore, and of tension and uneaſineſs in the belly. In ſuch a case, warm fomentations ſhould be applied to the abdomen, and the ſore covered with an emollient poultice, and this repeated as offen as may be necessary.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXVII. <hi rend="italic">Of the Stone.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">Of Stone in the Bladder.</hi></p><p>A <hi rend="smallcaps">variety</hi> of cauſes have been aſſigned as tending to the formation of calculi in the bladder of urine ; as, a decompoſition of a ſuperabundant quantity of earthy matter from the blood, on account of a ſedentary life ; certain articles of diet or drink, containing a greater quantity of earthy matter than others ; a continued uſe of ſolid food without a sufficient quantity of drink ; the peculiar action of absorbent veſſels ; the particular structure of the kidney ; the nature of the different excretory vessels ; the time the urine may remain in the kidney ; the habit of retaining the water in the bladder ; particles of blood getting into the kidney or bladder, and attracting the ſtony matter ſo as to form a nucleus. A certain change of the vessels of the kidney forming the urine has by ſome been conſidered as a more probable cauſe than any of the former. The formation of calculus ſometimes begins in the kidneys, at other times in the bladder.</p><p>After a calculus has begun to be formed, it ſometimes acquires a great ſize in a few months from the firſt obvious symptoms ; but ſometimes it remains in the bladder for many years without arriving at any conſiderable ſize.</p><p>The symptoms commonly come on gradually, and bear ſome kind of proportion to the ſize and inequalities of the ſtone. One of the firſt commonly taken notice of is an uneaſy ſenſation at the point of the urethra, which for ſome time is perceptible only upon making water, or upon uſing violent or jolting exerciſe. This ſenſation gradually increaſes ; and there is along with it a frequent deſire to make water, which is commonly voided in ſmall quantities, and ſometimes only in drops. When running in a full stream, it often ſuddenly stops, though the patient is conſcious that a conſiderable quantity ſtill remains, and feels a ſtrong inclination to void it. If the ſtone be large, the patient has a constant dull pain about the neck of the bladder, and frequent deſire of going to ſtool. The urine is generally of a limpid colour ; but it is ſrequently thick, depoſiting a mucous ſediment, and when the diſeaſe is violent it is often tinged with blood. All theſe complaints are greatly increaſed by exerciſe, especially by riding on horſeback ; and from a long continuance of pain, the patient’s health by degrees becomes much impaired, and unleſs effectual means are employed for removing the cause of the diſorder, death alone puts an end to his miſery.</p><p>We are rendered certain of the exiſtence of calculus when ſmall pieces of ſtone are frequently paſſed along with the urine. When this does not occur, we cannot be certain that the symptoms do not ariſe from an ulcer or tumor in the body or neck of the bladder, or from the preſſure of tumors in the neighbouring parts. In doubtful caſes, however, we have one mark by which we can judge with certainly, and that is by means of founding.</p><p>This is performed by introducing an infiniment called a <hi rend="italic">ſound</hi> (fig. 82.), formed of ſteel finely poliſhed, and having the natural curvature of the urethra. The patient is to be laid upon a table or acroſs a bed, with his ſhoulders raised upon a pillow, to bring the ſtone to the neck of the bladder, and his thighs a little elevated and ſeparated from each other. A ſound adapted to the ſize of the urethra is to be choſen ; and previous to the introduction it is to be laid in warm water till it be of the heat of the body, and then wiped and rubbed over with bland oil, butter, or axunge. The ſurgeon lays hold of the penis with his left hand, while with his right he introduces the ſound with its concave side towards the abdomen. He is now with his left hand to draw the penis gently forward upon the infiniment, which is to be gradually puſhed into the bladder. If any difficulty occur about the neck of the bladder, this may be obviated by introducing the finger into the anus, and raiſing the point of the inſtrument ; or the same purpoſe is more readily anſwered by depreſſing the handle of the ſound. If ſtill it does not paſs with eaſe, much force ought by no means to be uſed, left the inſtrument perforate the membranous part of the urethra.</p><p>As ſoon as the infiniment enters the bladder, if it happen at once to touch the ſtone, a tremulous motion will be communicated to the fingers of the operator, and the buſiness of founding is then accompliſhed, the nature of the diſeaſe being now aſcertained. Great care, however, is here always necessary, as a few particles of sand, or a hardened ſtate of the bladder, have ſometimes communicated the same ſenſation. If the ſtone be not ſoon diſcovered, the inſtrument is to be moved in all directions ; and ſhould the operator be ſtill unsuccessful, one of the fingers of the left hand is to be introduced into the rectum, ſo as to raise that part of the bladder in which a ſtone may probably be concealed. If even this attempt prove ineffectual, the body of the patient is to be put into different politicos, and perhaps one of the best is depreſſing the ſhoulders and raising the pelvis. By this mean a ſtone may generally be felt, providing it is not contained in a cyst, which very rarely happens. If after all theſe different attempts the ſurgeon ſhould fail in diſcovering the ſtone, the inſtrument is to be withdrawn ; and if symptoms of ſtone be ſtrongly marked, and it appear that neither scirrhus nor inflammation, which might give rise to theſe symptoms, do exiſt, a second or even a third trial is to be made on the following days.</p><p>Various lithontriptics have been recommended for dissolving the ſtone in the bladder; ſuch as lime-water, cauſtic alkali, ſoap, &amp;c. but none of them can be conveyed in ſuch a ſtate into the bladder as to be much depended upon, as they undergo the greateſt change in the course of the circulation. To obviate theſe changes, it has been recommended to inject certain fluids of this claſs through the urethra into the bladder ; but this has not been attended with any material advantages, and has generally been found to do injury to the bladder. The only effectual method of removing ſtones from the bladder is by means of a chirurgical operation ; the ſuccess of which depends much upon the dexterity of the surgeon, as well as on the conſtitution of the patient.</p><p>When the conſtitution has been ſo much impaired that the patient complains greatly of ſickneſs and oppreſſion at ſtomach, with nausea and an inclination to vomit, eſpecially upon taking food ; when he has likewiſe a constant thirst, and the pulſe is as high as a hundred strokes in the minute— an operation is improper till theſe symptoms are removed. The operation is improper alſo when the patient labours under a ſevere fit of the ſtone; for then inflammation of the bladder is apt to enſue to ſuch a degree as to produce ſuppuration. By frequent attacks and continuance of theſe fits, the coats of the bladder are apt to be thickened and greatly contracted. This laſt circumstance may be known by the introduction of the sound ; for then it will stop af-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0169.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0163"/>

Nor ought the operation to be performed when the bladder is ulcerated, eſpecially where the patient is old and much debilitated, and where the diſcharge of matter is great.</p><p>Children more readily recover from the operation of lithotomy than adults ; and old people from the age of 55 to that of 70, whoſe constitutions have not been broken, are in leſs danger than thoſe in the full vigour of life, probably owing to inflammatory ſymptoms being more apt to proceed to a dangerous length in the extremes of age than at the middle period of life. When the conſtitution, however, is not much impaired by the continuance of the diſeaſe, the operation may be undertaken with a probable degree of ſucceſs almoſt at any period of the patient’s life.</p><p>Several methods have been recommended for performing this operation ; but there are only two which can be practiſed with any propriety. One is, where the operation is to be performed immediately above the pubes, in that part of the bladder which is not covered with peritonæum : the other, where it is done in the perinæum, by laying open the neck and lateral part of the bladder, ſo as to allow of the extraction of the ſtone.</p><p>Franco, a French ſurgeon, finding a ſtone in a child of two years of age too large to be extracted through an opening in perinæo (the place where the operation was then performed), was induced to make an inciſion into the bladder above the pubes ; but though the ſtone was extracted and the child recovered, Franco, who publiſhed the case in 1561, never attempted the operation again, and even diſſuades others from doing it. It does not appear indeed to have been much practiſed anywhere till ſome time after the commencement of the preſent century, about the year 1720, when it was adopted and frequently performed in Britain and other parts of Europe for the ſpace of about 12 or 15 years. The lateral operation came then to be more generally known, and ſince this period the high operation has been ſeldom practiſed.</p><p>In performing the high operation, the bladder muſt be in a diſtended ſtate, ſo as to make it rise above the ossa pubis, to allow an inciſion to be made into that part of it which is uncovered by the peritonæum, and thereby to prevent the abdomen from being opened or its contents expoſed. Some days, or even weeks, previous to the operation, the patient ought to be deſired to retain his urine as long as he can, ſo as to diſtend the bladder till it can hold at leaſt a pound and a half, when the perſen is an adult and of an ordinary ſize ; or the penis may be tied up to allow the urine to collect. As theſe methods may be attended with great diſtreſs, ſome prefer diſtending the bladder by injecting warm water by slow degrees till the bladder is ſufficiently full, which may be easily known by relaxing the abdominal muſcles and feeling above the pubes.</p><p>When the operation is to be performed, the patient is to be laid upon a table of convenient height, with the pelvis higher than the ſhoulders, that the parts may be fully on the ſtretch, and to prevent the bowels from pressing upon the bladder. The legs and arms are to be properly held by aſſiſtants. An inciſion is to be made through the ſkin, in the very middle of the under and fore part of the abdomen, from ſome way under the umbilicus to the ſymphyſis pubes. The cellular ſubſtance, the tendon of the oblique muſcles, the muſculi recti and pyramidales, are now to be ſeparated ; and it is better to make this ſeparation from the pubes upwards, ſo as to be in no danger of cutting into the abdomen. The ſurface of the bladder will now appear uncovered by the peritonaeum. Then the operator, with a common ſcalpel, or an abſceſs lancet, or, what is better, with a concave ſharp-pointed knife, makes a perforation into the moſt prominent part of the bladder, till the fore-finger of the left hand can be introduced. The ligature is now to be removed from the penis ; then with a probe-pointed bistoury, making the finger ſerve as a conductor, the wound is to be made ſufficiently large for the extraction of the calculus, taking particular care, however, not to carry the inciſion ſo high as to cut the peritonæum. This part of the operation being finiſhed, the ſtone is to be extracted with the finger ; or if that be impracticable, the forceps are to be employed. Should it unfortunately happen that the ſtone is broken in the extraction, the pieces are to be removed entirely by the fingers rather than by ſcoops, which were ſometimes uſed. The edges of the wound in the integuments are now to be drawn together by means of the twisted future, leaving about an inch and a half immediately above the pubes for the diſcharge of any urine which may be there evacuated. The patient is to be laid in bed, with the pelvis ſtill kept higher than the ſhoulders. Gentle laxatives are to be occaſionally given, and the antiphlogiſic plan ſtrictly adhered to.</p><p>The advantages of this method are, that larger ſtones can be extracted by this than by the lateral operation, and that fiſtulous sores are leſs apt to enſue. The diſadvantages are, the danger of opening or wounding the peritonæum, and thereby expoſing the abdominal bowels ; the frequent occurrence of inflammation about the beginning of the urethra, ſo as to occaſion the urine to be diffuſed in the cellular ſubſtance on the outſide of the bladder, and thereby producing ſinuſes difficult to cure ; the extreme difficulty of healing the wound, eſpecially in bad conſtitutions ; and, laſtly, the ſmall number of patients, after the age of thirty, who have been found to recover from this operation.</p><p>Frere Jacques, a French prieſt, was the inventor of the lateral operation. He first appeared at Paris in 1697, and afterwards operated in a great number of caſes.</p><p>He introduced a found through the urethra into the bladder with a ſtraight biſtoury, cut upon the ſtaff, and carried his inciſion along the ſtaff into the bladder. He then introduced the fore finger of the left hand into the bladder, ſearched for the ſtone, which, having withdrawn the sound, he extracted by means of forceps. The patient was now carried to bed, and the after treatment left to the attendants.</p><p>Profeſſor Rau of Holland improved upon this method, by making a groove in the ſtaff, which enabled him, with greater certainty, to continue his inciſion into the bladder: but inſtead of dividing the urethra and proſtate gland, the latter of which he was afraid of wounding, he dissected by the side of the gland, till the convex part of the ſtaff was felt in the bladder, where he made his inciſion, and extracted the ſtone ; but this method was too difficult to perform, and attended with too many inconveniences and dangers ever to be generally received. It ſuggeſted, however, to the celebrated Cheſelden the lateral method of cutting, as it is now with a few alterations very generally practiſed. We ſhall attempt to deſcribe the different ſteps of this operation in its preſent improved ſtate.</p><p>The manner of preparing the patient depends upon a variety of circumſtances. If he be plethoric, a few ounces of blood ſhould be taken away, and at proper intervals the bowels ought to be emptied by any gentle laxative which will not gripe. The diet ſhould conſiſt of light food for ſome time previous to the operation. If the pain be violent, opium is necessary. Sometimes it is relieved by keeping the patient in bed with the pelvis raised, ſo as to remove the ſtone from the neck of the bladder. He ought not to<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0170.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0164"/>
                                                            sit up, or take any exerciſe, in the time of preparation. The warm bath ought to be uſed two or three times, and the patient ſhould remain in it half an hour at each time. A laxative ought to be given on the day preceding the operation, and an injection a few hours before it is performed. The patient ought to drink plentifully of ſome diluent liquor, and to retain the urine ſeveral hours previous to the operation. If this cannot be readily affected, a slight compreſſion, by means of a ligature, may be made upon the penis, ſo as to have the bladder sufficiently diſtended, that there may be no danger of the poſterior ſurface being hurt by the end of the gorget. The perinæum and parts about the anus ſhould be well ſhaved.</p><p>A table ſomewhat more than three feet in height, and of sufficient ſtrength, is now to be firmly placed, and properly covered with blankets, pillows, &amp;c. Upon this the patient is to be laid and properly ſecured ; and for this purpose there ought to be two pieces of broad firm tape, each about five feet in length, which are to be doubled, and a noose formed upon them. A nooſe is then to be put upon each wriſt, and the patient deſired to lay hold of the middle of his foot upon the outſide. One end of the ligature is to go round the hand and foot, and the other round the ankle and hand, and croſs again, ſo as to repeat the turns in the reverse way. A running knot is then to be tied, by which the hand and foot will be properly ſecured. The buttocks are then to be made to project an inch or two over the table, and to be raiſed conſiderably higher than the ſhoulders by a couple or more pillows, and one ought to be put under his head.</p><p>The operator is now to introduce a grooved staff (fig. 83.) of proportionable size, and open to the very end, through the urethra into the bladder ; and having again fully ſatisfied himſelf of the exiſtence of a ſtone, he inclines the ſtaff, if the ſurgeon be right-handed, obliquely over the right groin, ſo that the convex part of the staff may be felt in the perinæum on the left side of the raphe. He then fixes it, and delivers it to his aſſiſtant, who is to hold it with his right hand, desiring him to preſs it gently, in order to make the ſulcus of the ſtaff project in the direction in which he received it With his left hand the ſame aſſiſtant is to raiſe and ſupport the ſcrotum.</p><p>The thighs of the patient being sufficiently ſeparated by the aſſiſtants, and the ſurgeon being ſeated upon a chair of a proper height, and in a convenient light, he makes an inciſion with a common convex edged ſcalpel through the ſkin and cellular ſubſtance, immediately below the ſymphyſis of the oſſa pubis, which is a little below the ſcrotum, and where the crus penis and bulb of the urethra meet, and on the left side of the raphe, and continues it in a slanting direction downwards and outwards to the ſpace between the anus and tuberoſity of the iſchium, ending ſomewhat lower than the baſis of that proceſs, by which a cut will be made or three or four inches in length. This inciſion ought not to be shorter than is here directed, otherwiſe there will not be room for the rest of the operation. As ſoon as the integuments are thus divided, he ought to introduce two of the fingers of the left hand. With one he keeps back the lip of the wound next the raphe, and with the other he preſſes down the rectum. He ought likewiſe particularly to guard against cutting the crures of the penis, which he can readily feel, and ſeparate at their under part with one of the fingers. He next makes a second inciſion almoſt in the ſame direction with the firſt, but rather nearer to the raphe and anus, by which he preſerves the trunk of the arteria pudica. By this inciſion he divides the tranſverſalis penis, and as much of the levator ani and cellular ſubſtance within theſe as will make the proſtate gland perceptible to the finger.</p><p>If any conſiderable vessel be cut, it is immediately to be ſecured, though this is ſeldom necessary. After this he will have a view of the membranous part of the urethra, which is diſtinguiſhed from that covered by the bulb by being very thin. He is now to ſearch for the groove of the ſtaff with the fore finger of his left hand, the point of which be preſſes along from the bulb oſ the urethra to the proſtate gland, which ſurrounds the neck of the bladder. He keeps it there ; and turning the edge of the knife upwards, he cuts upon the groove of the ſtaff, and freely divides the membranous part of the urethra, from the proſtate gland to the bulb of the urethra, till the ſtaff can be felt perfectly bare, and that there is room to admit the point of the finger ; and as the finger aſſiſts in keeping the parts ſtretched, and effectually prevents the rectum from being hurt the inciſion into the urethra may be made with perfect eaſe and ſafety.</p><p>The next part of the operation, viz. dividing the prostate gland and neck of the bladder, might, by a dexterous operator, be ſafely performed with a common ſcalpel, with the edge turned the oppoſite way. But to guard against accidents, a more convenient inſtrument, called the <hi rend="italic">cutting gorget</hi> (fig. 84.), is now in general uſe. It was originally invented by Mr Hawkins of London, and ſince his time has undergone various alerations. Fig. 85. is a double gorget invented by Dr Monro. The inner plate, which, is blunt, is made to slip forwards to protect the back part of the bladder. The membranous part of the urethra being now divided, and the fore-finger still retained in its place, the point of the gorget, previously fitted to the groove., is to be directed along the nail of the finger, which will ſerve to conduct it into the groove of the ſtaff ; and as this is one of the niceſt parts of the operation, the moſt particular attention is here required that the point of the gorget be diſtinctly heard to rub in the bare groove, and that nothing is interpoſed.</p><p>In the introduction of the gorget into the bladder, if the aſſiſtant could be depended upon, the staff might be allowed to remain in his hand : the operator, however, generally chooſes to manage it himſelf. He now riſes from his feat, takes the ſtaff from the aſſiftant, raiſes it to near a right angle, and preſſes the concave part againſt the ſymphyſis of the oſſa pubes ; ſatisfies himſelf again that the point or beak is in the groove, and then puſhes on the gorget, following the direction of the groove till the beak slip from the point of the staff into the bladder. The gorget is not to be puſhed farther than this, otherwiſe it may wound the oppoſite side of the bladder, &amp;c.</p><p>The gorget having now entered the bladder, which is readily known by the diſcharge of urine from the wound, the ſtaff is to be withdrawn, and the finger introduced along the gorget to ſearch for the ſtone, which, when felt, will point out the direction to be given to the forceps ; at any rate, the introduction of the finger ſerves to dilate the wound in the bladder ; and this being done, a pair of forceps (fig. 8 <hi rend="italic">6.)</hi> of a proper ſize, and with their blades as nearly together as their form will allow, are to be introduced, and the gorget withdrawn slowly, and in the ſame direction in which it entered, ſo as to prevent it from injuring the parts in its return. After the forceps are introduced, and paſſed till they meet with a gentle reſiſtance, but no farther, the handles ought to be depreſſed till they are ſomewhat in an horizontal direction, as this will moſt correſpond with the fundus of the bladder. One blade of the forceps is to be turned towards the ſymphyſis of the pubes to defend the ſoft parts there, the other of conſequence will guard the return. After they have diſtinctly touched the ſtone, by moving them a little in various directions, they are then to be opened; and the ſtone laid hold of, which may gene<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0171.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0165"/>
                                                                rally be done with conſiderable eaſe. It frequently happens, however, that when the ſtone is ſmall, it is not readily felt with the forceps ; and inſtances may happen where the under and back part of the bladder may be ſo depreſſed as to conceal the stone. In ſuch a ſituation, nothing will more readily bring it in the way of the forceps than to introduce the finger into the rectum, and elevate this part of the bladder. Straight forceps are generally uſed; crooked ones, in ſome very rare cases, however, may be neceſſary, and therefore the ſurgeon ought to be provided with them.</p><p>After the forceps has laid hold of the ſtone, if it be ſmall and properly placed, it may readily be extracted ; but if, on the contrary, the handles of the forceps are now obſerved to be greatly expanded, it is certain the stone is improperly fixed, or that it is remarkably large : in either case it ſhould not be held faſt, but allowed to move into the moſt favourable ſituation ; or the finger is then to be introduced ſo as to place it properly for extraction. If this cannot be done with the finger, it ought to be allowed to slip out of the forceps, in order to get it more properly fixed ; and as the moſt common form of the ſtone is flat and oval, or somewhat like a flattened egg, the forceps ſhould have hold of the ſmalleſt diameter, while an end presents to the neck of the inſtrument. The ſtone ſhould be graſped with no greater firmneſs than is merely ſufficient to bring it fairly out. It ſhould be extracted in a slow and gradual manner.</p><p>When a ſtone is broken in the bladder, all the larger pieces are to be extracted by the forceps, which are to be introduced by means of the finger ſerving as a director. The ſmaller parts are to be removed by means of a ſcoop (fig. 87.), or probably the finger may be more convenient ; and as the leaſt particle allowed to remain, or which is not waſhed off by the urine, may ſerve as the nucleus of another ſtone, a large quantity of water, properly warmed, is to be injected by a bag and pipe, or by a ſyringe ; and for this purpoſe the body of the patient ſhould approach at leaſt to an upright poſture ; and to give the particles of ſtone an opportunity of collecting near the inciſion of the bladder, the wound may be ſtopped for a little after the injection is thrown in.</p><p>When a ſtone is extracted of a regular, firm, and rough ſurface, it ſeldom happens that any others remain in the bladder. On the contrary, when it is of an irregular ſhape, and smooth and poliſhed, particularly in certain places, with impreſſions formed upon it, there is the greateſt probability of others remaining. There are exceptions, however, to theſe rules ; and therefore the operator, inſtead of truſting to them, ſhould introduce his finger, which will anſwer the purpoſe without any other ſearcher.</p><p>If, after the operation, any conſiderable artery bleeds much, it is to be taken up with a ligature ; but if this be impracticable, the hemorrhagy ought to be ſtopped by means of pressure, and for this purpoſe a firm roller introduced at the wound anſwers ſufficiently : and to prevent any ſtoppage to the diſcharge of urine, a ſilver canula, covered with caddis, and duſted over with ſtyptic powder, may be introduced into the wound with advantage.</p><p>Sometimes it happens that a conſiderable quantity of blood, inſtead of paſſing off by the wound, is collected in the cavity of the bladder, and may produce very dangerous ſymptoms. To prevent this as much as poſſible, immediately upon the operation being finiſhed, the patient’s pelvis ſhould be made conſiderably lower than the reſt of his body; by which means the wound will be kept in a depending poſture, and the blood will eſcape more readily by the wound. But it it be found that blood is ſtill lodged in the cavity of the bladder, it muſt be immediately extracted.</p><p>As ſoon as the blooding is ſtopped, the patient is to be untied, a piece of dry ſoft charpee put between the lips of the wound, and often renewed, and the thighs brought together. He is then to be laid in a bed, in ſuch a way that the pelvis may be conſiderably lower than the reſt of the body, to give a favourable direction to any blood which may afterwards flow from the wound. A conſiderable doſe of laudanum is now to be given. From 30 to 50 drops for an adult will commonly be necessary. From this period, unleſs the ſtone has been large and difficult to extract, the patient commonly falls aſleep, or at leaſt lies quiet for a few hours ; but afterwards generally begins to complain of pain in the under part of the abdomen. Anodynes are now to be given both by the mouth and anus, and warm fomentations, by means of flannels or bladders filled with warm water, are to be applied to the region of the bladder, as the affection ſeems to be of the ſpaſmodic kind.</p><p>If by a continuance of theſe remedies the pain abates, no anxiety needs be entertained concerning it ; but if it increaſe, and eſpecially if the abdomen become hard and ſwelled, and the pulſe full and quick, and theſe ſymptoms become gradually worſe, great danger is to be apprehended, as they moſt commonly take place in conſequence of inflammation. In this ſituation, as much blood ought to be taken as the patient can bear. A large injection of warm water and oil, or linſeed tea, ſhould be given every ſix or ſeven hours, and the fomentations continued at the abdomen. If the ſymptoms continue to grow worſe, the patient ſhould be immediately put into the ſemicupium or half bath.</p><p>By a proper continuance of theſe means, with a low diet and plenty of diluent drink, the above ſymptoms may frequently be removed. The reverſe, however, is ſometimes the case. The wound becomes ſloughy and ill-conditioned; all the ſymptoms, in spite of every effort, continue to increaſe, and ſoon terminate in death.</p><p>But where matters end favourably, the wound by degrees puts on a better appearance ; the urine passes almoſt from the beginning by the urethra (moſt frequently, however, it is diſcharged by the wound for the firſt two or three weeks) ; the pain in the abdomen gradually abates, the feveriſh ſymptoms are ſoon removed, a complete cicatrix is formed, and the wound is sometimes cured in a month ; though upon other occaſions three will be neceſſary. But it muſt depend greatly on the nature of the conſtitution.</p><p>Excoriation of the buttocks may be prevented by placing a ſheet under them ſeveral times doubled the breadth to be 18 or 20 inches, and to be all rolled up, except the part which is to be laid under the patient, the reſt of the roll to be by his side, which is to be unrolled as the nurſe draws the wet part from under him. If, after the uſe of this, excoriations ſhould ſtill happen, the part may be waſhed with cold water ; or the parts round the wound, after being well dried, may be rubbed with any tough simple ointment.</p><p>In patients of a debilitated conſtitution incontinence of urine frequently occurs after this operation. In general, this is removed as the patient acquires ſtrength Nouriſhing diet, cold bath, the bark, and other tonics, are of much ſervice here ; but where theſe are afterwards found ineffectual, inſtruments for compreſſing the penis, or others for receiving the urine, have been found useful, and are now made in ſuch a convenient way as to allow them to be conſtantly used so long as they may be found neceſſary.</p><p>An operation for ſtone in the bladder is much ſeldomer required in women than in men, on account of the ſhortness of the urethra in the former allowing a readier paſſage for the ſmall calculi which get into, or are formed in, the bladder. It is likewise in women more simple, and of courſe more readily performed; It might be done in the same<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0172.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0166"/>
                                                                    manner as in the male, but there would be the greateſt probability of wounding the vagina. In a few caſes the operation has been performed from the vagina itſelf ; but it is by no means adviſable, as ſtones would not only be extracted with greater difficulty, but, on account of the thinneſs of the parts, the urine would moſt probably form a fiſtulous opening, and a communication be maintained between the bladder and vagina ; or cicatrices here might be attended with great inconvenience in child-labour.</p><p>In the method commonly practiſed, the patient being placed and ſecured in the same manner as in the operation upon the male, the operator introduces a ſhort grooved ſtaff, ſlightly curved (fig. 88.), into the bladder; then by means of the common gorget already mentioned, with its point passed along the groove of the ſtaff, he lays open the whole of the urethra and the neck of the bladder. The ſtaff is now to be removed, the finger introduced upon the gorget, and to feel for the ſtone, which is to be removed as already directed for the operation on the male ſubject. Where incontinence of urine occurs after the wound is healed, a peſſary is to be uſed within the vagina, or a ſponge applied, or a tin machine to receive the urine.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Of Stones in the Kidneys.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> ſymptoms of ſtone in the kidneys are, pain in the region of the kidneys, ſickneſs, and vomiting, the urine ſometimes mixed with blood, at other times with mucus or even purulent matter ; but the ſame ſymptoms are often induced by other cauſes, eſpecially from inflammation and ſuppuration of the kidney. Nephritic complaints have frequently ſubſiſted for a long time, where ſtones have been blamed as being the cauſe of them ; and yet upon diſſection purulent matter alone has been detected. From this circumſtance, as well as from the great depth of the parts and the large ſize of the blood veſſels of the kidney, the operation of nephrotomy could not be performed, but with the greateſt uncertainty and moſt imminent danger, and is therefore never attempted. A few caſes indeed have appeared where inflammation induced by a ſtone in the kidney terminated in abſceſs, and the ſtones were taken out ; but it was not till they had worked their way out of the kidneys into the cellular ſubſtance, ſo that it only remained to open the abſceſs and extract them ; but otherwiſe the operation is never to be thought of.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Of Stones in the Urethra.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Those</hi> who are troubled with calculous complaints frequently paſs ſmall ſtones along with their urine ; and when theſe are angular or of conſiderable ſize, they ſometimes stick, and give much uneaſineſs. The ſymptoms are at firſt pain, then inflammation and ſwelling, attended with a partial, or total ſuppreſſion of urine, which, if long neglected, is apt to terminate in a rupture oſ the urethra, when the urine will be diſcharged into the neighbouring parts. The greateſt attention is therefore neceſſary to get the ſtone extracted as ſoon as poſſible.</p><p>When a ſtone is in the urethra, unleſs it be of a large ſize, or has been long impacted, and the inflammation great, attempts ought to be made with the fingers to puſh it out ; but previous to this, the penis ſhould be relaxed as much as poſſible, ſo as to remove a certain degree of ſpaſm which the preſence of ſtone here probably creates. Blood ought to be drawn by general or local means, according as the patient may be of a plethoric or emaciated habit. He ſhould be immerſed in a warm bath, and get a full doſe of laudanum, and warm oil ought alſo to be thrown into the urethra. After theſe remedies have relaxed the parts as much as may be, the extraction is to be attempted.</p><p>For this purpoſe certain inſtruments have been contrived, particularly a tube containing a pair of elastic forceps (fig. 89.), to be introduced into the urethra ſo as to lay hold of the ſtone. In ſome caſes they certainly might anſwer the purpoſe, but they have not been found very uſeful ; and as they may increaſe the irritation already preſent in the urethra, they are ſeldom, if ever, employed. Inſtead of them, the ſurgeon uſes gentle pressure on the penis to puſh the ſtone outwards ; and as calculi larger than a field bean have ſometimes been paſſed by the urethra, an operation ought not to be performed till gentler means have been perſiſted in for ſome time. When theſe means have failed, an inciſion ought to be made immediately upon the ſtone, which is then to be removed by a probe, or with a pair of ſmall forceps. When a ſtone is lodged near the neck of the bladder, after the patient has been placed and ſecured in the ſame manner as for the lateral operation, while an aſſiſtant ſupports the ſcrotum and penis, the operator introduces a finger oiled into the anus, to ſupport the ſtone in its place, and prevent it from slipping into the bladder. An inciſion is then to be made, and the ſtone turned out. The after treatment will be nearly the ſame as that after the operation of lithotomy.</p><p>When, again, a ſtone has advanced further in the urethra, the beſt method is to draw the skin ſtrongly forwards or backwards, and then to cut upon it and turn it out, when the ſkin will ſlide back ſo as to cover the wound, and prevent the urine from paſſing through it ; and by this means it will generally heal by the firſt intention. If part oſ the urine paſs through the wound, and insinuate into the cellular ſubſtance, an attempt is to be made with the hand to press it back. If that prove inſufficient, a cut is to be made through the ſkin oppoſite to the inciſion of the urethra ; but this will ſeldom be found necessary. If a ſtone is fixed near the point of the urethra, it may be removed with a pair of forceps ; or, if this fail, the urethra is to be dilated with a ſcalpel ; and if this alſo be inſufficient, an inciſion is to be made as above directed. When the cure is nearly completed, a tube formed of ſilver or elaſtic gum, or a hollow bougie, may be uſed to keep the uretha of a proper ſize.</p><p>The worſt part of the urethra for a ſtone to stick in is that immediately behind the ſcrotum ; for then the urine is apt to paſs by the inciſion into the cellular ſubſtance of the ſcrotum, ſo as to occaſion large ſwellings there. To prevent this, a ſtone ſo ſituated ought, if poſſible, to be pushed forwards with the fingers ; or if this be impracticable, it ſhould be puſhed back into the perinæum by means of a ſtaff. If both methods fail, a cut is to be made at the under part of the ſcrotum, which is to be well ſupported, and at one side of the ſeptum, and continued upwards till the ſtone is felt, when an inciſion is to be made into the urethra, and the ſtone extracted as before directed.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXVIΠ. <hi rend="italic">Of Incontinence and Suppression of Urine.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Incontinence</hi> of urine may ariſe from various cauſes, as, from a loss of power in the ſphincter of the bladder, while the natural tone of that organ remains unimpaired ; or from irritation about the neck of the bladder, produced by the friction of ſtones contained in it ; or from a laceration of parts by the operation of lithotomy ; or from the pressure of the uterus in a ſtate of pregnancy.</p><p>When the diſeaſe is owing to a want of tone in the ſphincter, the cure is very difficult, becauſe the constitution in general is frequently affected. The moſt uſeful remedies are tonics, eſpecially peruvian bark, chalybeate waters, and<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0173.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0167"/>
                                                                        the cold bath, both generally and locally applied. Cold ſubſtances applied to the perinæum are perhaps of greater ſervice than any thing else, as cloths wet with vinegar and cold water, or with a ſtrong ſolution of ſaccharum ſaturni in vinegar ; but the best method of applying cold is to daſh water immediately from the fountain upon the anus and perinæum. When it ariſes from the irritation of ſtones in the bladder, opiates and mucilaginous liquors plentifully uſed frequently give great relief. When incontinence of urine is owing to a laceration of parts in performing the operation of lithotomy, the diſeaſe is nearly of the ſame nature as that from the cauſe first mentioned, and therefore the same remedies are of ſervice. When theſe remedies fail in either of the caſes, compreſſion of the urethra prevents any inconvenience ariſing from the constant dripping of the urine; and for this purpoſe an inſtrument termed <hi rend="italic">jugum penis</hi> (fig. 90.) is applied to the penis ; or, to press against the urethra of the female, peſſaries (fig. 91. a and b) are contrived, which are made in ſuch a way as to be introduced into the vagina, and there to preſs upon the urethra. They are sometimes made of sponge, but thoſe of ivory or wood well poliſhed are more generally preferred. A ſmall bottle made of elaſtic gum, and open at both ends for the paſſage of the menſtrual diſeharge, anſwers the purpoſe equally well. Certain caſes however occur where preſſure upon the urethra is improper, eſpecially where there is a constant deſire to paſs water ; and here much relief is obtained from the use of receivers, which are now suited to both ſexes. Fig. 92 . repreſents one for the male, and fig. 93. one for the female.</p><p>We ſhall here treat only of that ſpecies of ſuppreſſion of urine where the urine is collected in the bladder, but from ſome obſtructing cauſe is prevented from being diſcharged. It ariſes from a variety of cauſes.</p><p>When it ariſes from a want of tone in the body of the bladder, it is often connected with palſy of the lower extremities; it is frequently owing alſo to retaining urine too long. The catheter, in this caſe, is commonly an effectual remedy, and ought to be employed as ſoon as the ſuppreſſion is evidently formed, and repeated from time to time, till the tone of the ſyſtem is recovered by the uſe of proper remedies. The method of introducing the catheter is the ſame with that already directed for founding for the stone. Fig. 94. a catheter for the male, fig. 95. one for the female.</p><p>When the affection ariſes from ſpaſm about the neck of the bladder, opiates, warm water thrown into the rectum, and afterwards the warm bath, are the best means of producing relief. When it proceeds from ſcirrhus of the prostate gland, or from other tumors, or from obstructions of the urethra in conſequence of gonorrhoea, the treatment to be afterwards deſcribed will be found beſt ſuited for ſuch complaints. When the ſuppression ariſes from the preſſure of the uterus in the latter months of pregnancy, change of poſture is ſometimes found to have ſome effect ; but if this fail, immediate relief can commonly be given by the introduction of the catheter, which in women is for the moſt part readily done.</p><p>Suppreſſion of urine from inflammation affecting the neck of the bladder is one of the moſt alarming varieties of the diſeaſe, as it produces pain, and ſuch a degree of ſwelling in the parts as to render the introduction of the catheter inadmiſſible. It may ariſe from the matter in gonorrhoea paſſing backwards along the courſe of the urethra. An improper uſe of injections has likewiſe frequently produced this ſpecies of the diſeaſe. The treatment is nearly the ſame as for inflammatory complaints in other parts of the body. Blood-letting ſhould be employed, and particularly leeches ſhould be applied to the perinæum. Opiates ought to be given in large doſes. Injections of warm water ſhould be frequently thrown up the rectum, and the whole body ſhould be immerſed in the warm bath. If theſe means be properly uſed, they will very ſeldom fail of ſucceſs ; but when they do not prove effectual, when the bladder becomes painfully diſtended, and when every attempt to introduce the catheter has failed, nothing is to be depended upon but a puncture made into the body of the bladder, in order to diſcharge the water contained in it.</p><p>Various methods have been propoſed for effecting this operation. Puncturing the bladder above the pubes has been recommended by many respectable authors. The following is the method of doing it : A lancet-pointed trocar, about two inches long, is to be at once introduced through the integuments, about an inch and half above the pubes, into the body of the bladder. The stilette is to be removed as ſoon as the water begins to flow through a groove formed in it, and the urine allowed to flow through the canula, which is ſecured to the body by means of a bandage. A cork is to be fitted to the canula, that the urine may paſs off at intervals only. The canula is to be retained till the cauſe which produced the obstruction is fo far removed that the patient can diſcharge the urine in the natural way. It ought to be removed every three or four days, and cleared from the sordes which adheres to it, otherwiſe it ſoon becomes covered with a calculous cruſt, which renders the extraction exceedingly difficult.

                                                                            thra ; or tumors, from whatever cauſe, may be ſeated in the corpora cavernoſa contiguous to the urethra, and may preſs upon it in inch a manner as to cauſe an adheſion of its sides, and thereby produce ſtoppage of the urine. Spaſmodic ſtrictures of the urethra ſometimes ariſe from ſtone in the bladder. Sometimes in gonorrhoea there is ſuch a degree of contraction that neither ſtaff nor bougie can enter. This variety of obſtruction is known by its coming on ſuddenly, and going off ſometimes almoſt completely in the ſpace of a few hours. Of the permanent ſtricture, or ſtricture properly ſo called, Mr Hunter obſerves, that in moſt of the caſes of this kind which he has ſeen the diſeaſe extends no farther in breadth than if the part had been ſurrounded with a piece of packthread. He has however ſeen the urethra irregularly contracted for above an inch in length, owing to its coats or internal membrane being irregularly thickened and forming a winding canal. He farther obſerves, that a ſtricture does not ariſe, in all caſes, from an equal contraction of the urethra all round ; but in ſome, from a contraction of one side, which throws the paſſage to the oppoſite side, and often makes it difficult to paſs the bougie. In ſome few caſes, he ſays, there are more ſtrictures than one ; he has ſeen half a dozen in one urethra, and finds that the bulbous part is much more ſubject to ſtrictures than the whole of the urethra beſides ; that they are ſometimes on this side of the bulb, but very ſeldom beyond it ; and that they are often slow in forming, it being frequently years from the time they are perceived before they become very troubleſome. Contrary to the opinion of others, Mr Hunter doubts very much if the ſtricture commonly, or even ever, ariſes from the effects of the venereal diſeaſe, or the method of cure ; for ſtrictures are common to other paſſages, and ſometimes happen in the urethra where no venereal complaint had ever been.</p><p>When obſtructions are occasioned by caruncles in the urethra, bougies (fig. 96.) ſhould be introduced rubbed over with bland oil until a reſiſtance is met with. When a bougie cannot be introduced far enough, one with a ſmaller point is to be uſed, but not till the day following, left the part be too much irritated. They ought not to be allowed to remain long at first, particularly when they occaſion a confiderable degree of pain.</p><p>When ſuppreſſion of urine ariſes from ſwellings in or about the urethra, in conſequence of inflammation, an attempt ſhould be made to diſcuſs theſe immediately, or bring them into a ſtate of ſuppuration, and diſcharge the pus as ſoon as it is formed. But when the nature of the tumor is ſuch as not to terminate in either of theſe ways, extirpation of the diſeaſed parts, when this is found practicable, is the only probable means of relief. Bougies ſhould at the ſame time be uſed to aſſiſt in the cure.</p><p>When ſpaſmodic affections are preſent in the urethra, the remedies to be employed are, warm emollients, as rubbing the part with warm oil ; anodynes, as opium given by the mouth, but more eſpecially by the anus ; blood-letting in plethoric habits, and this to be generally and locally applied ; bliſters put to the penis or perinæum; electricity, after plethora has been removed. Some caſes may be treated with bougies ; but where the diſeaſe is purely ſpaſmodical, they are generally found to be hurtful ; though in other caſes, when the violence of the diſeaſe is ſo far removed, if they can be introduced, they are of ſervice, by relieving any obſtructions which may remain after the remedies above-mentioned have been exhibited. Coſtiveneſs ought likewiſe to be guarded againſt. The permanent ſtricture is to be cured by bougies.</p><p>Bougies act ſolely by preſſure, and by ſupporting the part ; hence they ſhould be ſo large as to fill the paſſage, and sufficiently flexible to be eaſily introduced. They are formed of various materials, as a compoſition of diachylon plaſter, oil, and wax melted and put upon linen, which is afterwards properly rolled up ; or they are formed of leather catgut, &amp;c. properly prepared : but the beſt of any are thoſe which are formed of elaſtic gum. Bougies, when properly made, can ſometimes be kept in for six or eight hours together; but the length of time proper for their retention muſt depend much upon the feelings of the patient. At all times when they give much pain they ought to be removed, and not introduced again till the part is in a ſtate fit for receiving them. They ſhould be gradually increaſed in their ſize, till the paſſage returns to its natural dimensions. They ought to be continued for ſome time after, till it appear that there is no danger of a return of the complaint.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Of Phymosis and Paraphymosis.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> phymosis the prepuce is thickened, and contracted before the glans, ſo that it cannot be readily drawn behind it. In ſome people there is a conſtitutional phymoſis from the natural ſtraitneſs of the prepuce. Sometimes it ariſes from the matter ſecreted by the odoriferous glands at the root of the glands being confined and becoming acrid ; ſometimes from an anaſarcous ſwelling of the ſcrotum and penis ; but moſt frequently from venereal virus.</p><p>The cure muſt depend upon the nature of the cauſe producing the diſeaſe. If the ſymptoms be inflammatory and of no long continuance, fomenting the parts frequently with warm emollient decoctions, or bathing them in warm milk, and then applying emollient poultices, or keeping the diſeaſed parts conſtantly moiſt with a cold aſtringent ſolution, and turning the penis upwards and ſupporting it againſt the belly, commonly give relief. If the inflammation has ariſen from a venereal cauſe, part of the fluid ought frequently to be injected, by means of a ſyringe, between the prepuce and glans, ſo as to waſh off any matter which may there be concealed ; but if the inflammation ſtill continues to increaſe, blood-letting is neceſſary, both general and local. The veins of the penis are ſometimes adviſed to be opened with a lancet ; but this is unſafe on account of the nerves. Leeches may be applied ; but care muſt be taken, in venereal caſes, left the bites of theſe animals, by abſorbing venereal matter, turn into chancres. Along with the remedies already adviſed, gentle lexatives, low diet, and abſtinence, ought to be preſcribed. But if, after a due perſeverance in theſe means, it is found that they have had little effect in removing the diſorder, or perhaps that the ſymptoms are conſtantly increaſing, and that chancres are confined under the prepuce ; in that caſe it is neceſſary to slit open the prepuce, which is beſt done by a ſharp-pointed biſtoury, concealed in a grooved directory, fig. 98. This is to be introduced between the prepuce and glands, till the director is found by the finger to have reached the upper or back part of the prepuce. The operator is now to keep the director firm with one hand, while with the other he puſhes forward the knife, till its point paſſes through the prepuce ; then drawing the inſtrument towards him, he cuts the prepuce through its whole length.</p><p>The operation being performed, the parts are to be wasted and cleaned with warm water, and the sore dressed with a little ſoft lint, and a compreſs of linen laid over it. The whole may be retained by a ſmall bag properly adapted, and ſecured by two ſtraps to a bandage put round the body. This bag may be left open at the under end, to allow the patient to make water, without removing the dreſſings ; but if this be found impracticable, the dreſſings may be removed with little inconvenience.

It is evident, that when this diſeaſe is of the venereal kind, the ſore will not readily heal till the poiſon be eradicated from the constitution.</p><p>In ſome caſes of phymoſis the preputium is ſo remarkably long, and the contraction ſo much confined to the point, that a circular inciſion is preferable to a longitudinal one ; and it is easily effected, by ſeparating ſuch a portion as may be found necessary of the whole circumference of the prepuce. The dreſſings in this caſe are the ſame as when the prepuce is slit open.</p><p>Paraphymoſis is the reverſe of phymoſis, being formed by a retraction of the prepuce, producing ſtricture behind the glans of the penis. Like the former diſeaſe, it ariſes moſt frequently from a venereal infection, but may be produced from whatever preternaturally enlarges the glans or conſtricts the prepuce.</p><p>In the incipient ſtate, the patient may generally be relieved by the ſurgeon puſhing the glans gently back with his thumbs, while with his fingers he brings the prepuce gradually forward. But a more effectual method than this is to incloſe the glans with one of the hands, and preſs gently on all ſides, by which the fluids forming the enlargement will be puſhed into the body of the penis behind the ſtricture. If this method be perſevered in for a conſiderable time, it will generally be found to anſwer the purpoſe : but ſhould it prove ineffectual, we may try the effects of cold applications ; and the beſt ſeem to be thoſe of the ſaturnine kind. When the penis is evidently much ſwelled and inflamed, the patient ſhould be kept cool, gentle laxatives and low diet ſhould be preſcribed, and a number of leeches applied to the penis. Should the diſeaſe ſtill continue to increaſe, and an œdematous ſwelling appear about the under part of the prepuce, an operation is necessary to prevent a mortification from taking place in the glans. An inciſion is to be made on each ſide of the penis immediately behind the glans, ſo large as completely to divide the ſtricture. The wound ought to be allowed to blood freely; after which a pledget ſpread with ſimple ointment is to be applied, and an emollient poultice laid over the whole.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Of an Incomplete Urethra.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> children, eſpecially males, the urethra is ſometimes incomplete, ending before it reaches the uſual place of termination. Sometimes it does ſo without any external opening, at other times it opens at a diſtance from the common termination. In the first caſe, a small trocar is to be introduced in the direction the urethra ought to take, till the urine be diſcharged ; after which, the paſſage is to be kept open by the uſe of bougies, till the ſides be rendered callous and an opening preſerved. In the other caſe, as the opening which is already found affords a temporary paſſage for the urine, it will be better to delay doing any operation till the patient be farther advanced in life, when it is to be performed as in the former caſe.</p><p>After the operation, a piece of flexible catheter may be introduced, as well for the purpoſe of rendering the paſſage free and callous, as for carrying off the water till a cure is made.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV. <hi rend="italic">Of Amputating the Penis.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> operation is found necessary in certain diſeaſes which will not yield to other remedies ; as in caſes of mortification and cancer. The following is the method of performing it :</p><p>A circular inciſion is first to be made through the sound ſkin a little bevond the diſeaſed parts; the skin is then to be drawn back by an aſſiſtant, and the body of the penis divided by one ſtroke of the knife (fig. 99.) immediately at the edge of the retracted ſkin. The principal arteries, which are two or three on each ſide, are next to be ſecured by ligatures ; and if an oozing of blood ſtill continue, the ſurface of the ſore ought to be dusted with ſome styptic powder. To allow the patient to make water, a ſilver canula (fig. 99. <hi rend="italic">a)</hi> is to be introduced into the urethra, and retained there by two ſmall ligatures fixed to the ſide of the canula, their other extremities being faſtened to a bandage put round the body. The wound is to be dressed with ſoft lint, kept in its place by a piece of linen previouſly perforated for the introduction of the canula. The dreſſings are to be kept on by a narrow roller passed a few times, round the penis, which, by gently compreſſing the penis upon the inſtrument, will effectually prevent any farther diſcharge of blood. The after treatment of the ſore ſhould be ſimilar to wounds in other parts of the body. But it will not be necessary to make any farther compreſſion of the penis upon the canula, as the diſcharge of blood will, previous to this time, be entirely ſtopped. The tube is to be allowed to remain in the urethra during the whole time of the cure.</p><p>Before any operation of this kind is attempted, the ſurgeon ought to examine attentively, whether the diſeaſe be in the penis itſelf, or only in the skin, as the prepuce, alone is frequently ſo much enlarged and otherwiſe diſeaſed as to give cauſe for ſuſpicion that the glans and body of the penis are likewiſe affected. This precaution is the more necessary, as ſeveral instances have occurred where the glans and body of the penis have been removed, and, after the operation, have been found perfectly ſound. Previous to amputation, therefore, where there is any cauſe for ſuſpicion, the prepuce ſhould be slit open, and the glans examined, ſo as to avoid amputating more than what is abſolutely diſeaſed.</p><p>It ſometimes happens that the frænum of the penis is ſo ſhort as to give considerable uneaſineſs in time of an erection. When this is the caſe, it may be ſafely divided by a pair of ſcissars, or by a ſharp-pointed biſtoury, and the wound dressed with a little charpie.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V. <hi rend="italic">Of Fistula in Perinaeο.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> term implies a ſinuous ulcer in the perinæum, commonly communicating with the urethra, but ſometimes opening into the bladder.

When more openings than one are preſent, they are to be treated in the ſame manner ; and if the ſinuſes are found to be remarkably hard, the removal of a ſmall portion of the diſeaſed part will expedite the cure, though the conſequent inflammation and ſuppuration will render this ſeldom neceſsary. After the operation, the wound is to be dressed with pledgets of emollient ointment, ſo as to allow it to fill up completely from its bottom. The whole is to be covered with a pledget of emollient ointment; and proper compreſſes being applied over it, the dreſſings are to be ſupported by a T bandage.</p><p>If ſymptoms of inflammation be violent, an emollient poultice is to be applied in the courſe of twenty-four hours after the operation ; and as ſoon as free ſuppuration is formed, light eaſy dreſſings are to be uſed till the ſore is completely healed.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXX. <hi rend="italic">Diſeaſes about the Anus.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">Of Hemorrhoids or Piles.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> treatment of piles has been already conſidered under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Medicine ;</hi> but it ſometimes happens, that although the means mentioned there have been employed, the diſeaſe becomes ſo violent as to require the aſſiſtance of the surgeon.

" When it opens externally, and has likewiſe a communication with the gut, it is termed a <hi rend="italic">complete fistula ;</hi> but if it has no communication with the rectum it is called <hi rend="italic">incomplete.</hi> When the ulcer communicates with the gut, but has no external opening, it is named an <hi rend="italic">internal</hi> or <hi rend="italic">occult fistula.</hi> It is likewise diſtinguiſhed into ſimple and compound. The firſt is where one or more ſinuſes communicate with the internal ulcer, but where the parts in the neighbourhood are sound. The compound fiſtula is where the parts through which the ſinus runs are hard and ſwelled, or where the ulcer communicates with the bladder, vagina, os ſacrum, and other contiguous parts.</p><p>The cauſes producing the diſeaſe may be, whatever tends to form matter about the anus, piles, condylomatous tumors, hardened feces, or any cauſe which produces irritation and inflammation, ſo as to end in ſuppuration. As ſoon as a ſwelling about the anus appears to terminate in ſuppuration, every thing ought to be done which can accelerate the formation of matter. A proper degree of heat, warm poultices, fomentations, and the steams of warm water, are the means beſt suited for this purpoſe ; and as ſoon as matter is formed, it ought to be diſcharged by a free incision in the loweſt part of the tumor. Much depends upon the proper treatment here ; for if the opening be made too small, or if long delayed, the matter gets into the looſe cellular ſubstance, and inſtead of producing one, produces many ſinuſes, and theſe ſometimes running to a great depth. The parts ought then to be covered with ſoft lint ſpread with mild ointment, and an emollient poultice kept conſtantly over the whole. By this any remaining hardneſs. will be removed, the cavity will fill up like impoſthumous tumors in other parts, and a complete cure will in general ſoon be made.</p><p>It more frequently happens, however, that the practitioner is not called in till the abſcefs has burſt of itſelf, and till matter has insinuated into the ſurrounding cellular ſubstance, and formed one or more real fistulæ.</p><p>The firſt thing to be done now is to diſcover the real courſe of the different ſinuſes, and the probe is the beſt inſtrument for this purpoſe. If there be openings in the external ſurface, there is commonly little difficulty in this. If they run along the perinæum or the muſcles, the probe will generally detect them. If they follow the direction of the gut, the beſt method is to introduce the fore finger oiled into the rectum, while the probe is entered at the external orifice. If there be a communication between the gut and the ſinus, the probe may be made to paſs till its point is felt by the finger in the rectum. We diſcover with certainty if a ſinus communicate with the gut, when air or feces are diſcharged, or when any mild fluid injected returns by the anus.</p><p>After the courſe of the ſinus has been diſcovered, the method of cure is next to be conſidered. Astringent or eſcharotic injections, preſſure, and ſetons, are inſupportable, on account of the violent pain which they produce. The only method therefore of bringing on a proper degree of inflammation is a free inciſion along the whole courſe of the ſinus. The courſe of the different ſinuſes having been previouſly diſcovered, a laxative ought to be given on the day preceding this operation, and a clyſter an hour or two before performing it. The patient is to be placed with his<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0177.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0171"/>
                                                                                        back towards a window, while his body leans upon a bed, table, or chair. The finger of the ſurgeon is to be rubbed over with oil, and introduced into the rectum. The end of a crooked probe-pointed biſtoury (fig. 100.) is then to be paſſed into the fiſtula, and puſhed againſt the finger in the rectum, if the ſiſtula be complete. But in caſes of incomplete fistulae, the point of the inſtrument muſt be made to perforate the gut before it can reach the finger. Some make the perforation with a ſharp-pointed biſtoury, which can be made to flip along the side of a probe-pointed one, as at fig. 101. After the biſtoury has reached the cavity of the rectum, the point of it is then to be brought out at the anus, and a cut made downwards to lay the ſinue completely open. In this operation the ſphincter ani muſcle is commonly cut, if the ſinus be high ; but no inconvenience is found to ariſe from this circumſtance. It ſometimes, though rarely, happens, that the ſinus goes beyond the reach of the finger, and even as high as the upper end of the sacrum. The only thing which can be done in this caſe is to cut as high as the finger can go, ſo as to give a free and eaſy vent to the matter.</p><p>Some practitioners, with a view to prevent troubleſome hemorrhagies, and others to free the patient from the dread of the knife, have propoſed to open the ſinuſes by means of ligature (fig. 102.). By introducing one end of a piece of silver or leaden wire into the ſinus, then bringing it out at the anus, and twiſting the ends together, the contained parts may be ſo compreſſed as to produce a complete diviſion of them. But this is both more painful and tedious than the ſcalpel, and appears to be by no means neceſſary.</p><p>When the preſence of an occult fiſtula is ſuspected, its exiſtence ought first to be fully aſcertained, by examining whether the matter which is paſſed by ſtool proceeds from an ulcer in the bowels or from an abſceſs at the side of the anus. It is diſcovered by matter from the bowels being mixed with the feces, and no pain about the anus. In occult ſiſtula, a hardness, ſwelling, and diſcoloration, are obſerved upon ſome ſpot near the anus, and there is a ſenſation of conſiderable pain upon preſſure being made upon it. The operation in this is the same with that in the other two varieties of the diſorder ; only that an opening is previouſly to be made, by a lancet or ſcalpel, in that ſpot where the matter appears to be lodged. By this the lore will be reduced to a complete ſiſtula, and the reſt of the operation will be eaſily performed.</p><p>In this manner the different ſinuſes are to be operated upon, when in a ſimple ſtate ; but in thoſe of a compound nature, where the parts in the vicinity of the ſores have been ſeparated from each other by an effuſion of matter into the cellular ſubſtance, and where all the under end of the rectum has, in ſome rare caſes, been attached from the surrounding parts, two modes of operating have been recommended ; either to remove a conſiderable portion of the external integuments, ſo as to give free vent to the matter ;or to extirpate all the lower end of the rectum which is found to be detached from the surrounding parts. But from the pain and ſubſequent diſtreſs which they occaſion, theſe methods are judiciouſly laid aſide. All that is neceſsary to be done here is to lay the detached portion of gut completely open, as in caſes of ſimple fistulae ; but if this be inſufficient for allowing the gut to apply properly to the contiguous parts, another inciſion ſhould be made on the oppoſite side. If the neighbouring bones be ſound found, and the conſtitution in other reſpects be unimpaired, a complete cure will probably be obtained.</p><p>The matter ſometimes inſinuates itſelf between the ſkin and muſcles of the perinæum, or of the hip. When this is obſerved, the ſac produced by it ſhould be laid open from one end to the other by one or more inciſions as circumſtances may require. Sometimes, from neglect or improper treatment, the matter collected does not find a proper outlet, and then the parts moſt contiguous to it inflame, become painful, and gradually acquire ſuch a morbid calloſity as to put on a ſcirrhous appearance. In ſuch caſes a cure may be effected by giving free vent to the matter, preventing every future collection, and inducing and preſerving a ſuppuration in the ſubſtance of the parts chiefly affected. To accompliſh this last circumſtance, however, it may ſometimes be neceſſary not only to lay the ſinuſes freely open, but to cut in upon the obdurated parts.</p><p>The different ſinuſes having been laid open, care muſt be taken to apply the neceſſary dressings. Upon this much of the ſucceſs attending the operation depends. Dry lint, till lately, was much uſed by practitioners ; but it has been found to produce ſo much irritation, eſpecially when too much crammed in, as to be one of the cauſes of that diarrhoea which is frequently ſo troubleſome after operations of this kind. Inſtead, therefore, of this sort of dressing, pledgets, lint, or ſoft old linen ſpread with any simple ointment, are to be preferred. After the sores have been cleared from clotted blood, the pledgets are to be gently inſinuated between their edges, but not to ſuch a depth, or with ſuch force, as to give any uneaſineſs. This being done, and a compreſs of ſoft linen with a T bandage being applied over the whole, the patient is to be carried to bed ; and the dreſſings being renewed, either after every stool, or, when theſe are not frequent, once in the twenty four hours, the sores will generally fill up from the bottom, and will at laſt cicatrize in the same manner as wounds in any other part of the body. Sometimes, however, they acquire a soft, flabby, unhealthy aspect, and the matter diſcharged from them is thin, fetid, and occaſionally mixed with blood. Theſe appearances may ſometimes ariſe from some part of a ſinus having been overlooked. In this caſe advantage may follow from the part being laid completely open. But it more uſually proceeds from ſome affection of the general ſyſtem ; and till this is eradicated the sores cannot be expected to heal.</p><p>In the cure of sores in other parts oſ the body, practitioners have ſometimes found great advantage to ariſe from the uſe of issues. The ſame thing is now found to be applicable here. Wherever therefore fistulæ are of long ſtanding, while any diſorder exiſting in the conſtitution is properly attended to, practitioners recommend, that an iſſue, in proportion to the quantity of the matter diſcharged by the sores, ſhould be immediately employed. In this way, if the bones in the neighbourhood are not diſeaſed, there will be reaſon to expect that a complete cure will be obtained.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV. <hi rend="italic">Of Prolapſus Ani.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> is a protruſion of part of the rectum beyond the anus.

In ſome cases, the end of the rectum protrudes at the uſual ſituation of the anus, and is only covered with the common integuments ; but in others, no termination of that gut is diſcoverable. Sometimes the rectum ends within an inch of the uſual seat of the anus ; at others, it reaches no farther than the top of the ſacrum. In ſome caſes it terminates in the bladder ; in others, in the vagina. In the moſt favourable caſes, where the rectum protrudes, an opening may he readily made by a ſcalpel or lancet ; but when no direction of this kind is met with, an inciſion is then to be made in the place where the anus is uſually ſituated, and is to be continued in the direction of the os coccygis and ſacrum, which is the courſe the inteſtine commonly takes. The finger is to be uſed as a director along it ; the parts are to be cut either till faeces are obſerved, or till the inciſion has been made the length of the finger. If ſtill the faeces do not appear, a lancet-pointed trocar is to be puſhed forward upon the finger in ſuch a direction as the operator thinks will moſt probably reach the gut. An artificial anus is likewiſe to be attempted, where the gut terminates in the bladder or vagina.

When the bone is forced entirely out of its cavity, the luxation is termed <hi rend="italic">complete ;</hi> when this is not the caſe, it is <hi rend="italic">partial</hi> or <hi rend="italic">incomplete.</hi> When there is alſo a wound of the ſoft parts communicating with the joint, it is called a <hi rend="italic">compound,</hi> and when there is no wound, a sim <hi rend="italic">ple luxation.</hi></p><p>The common ſymptoms oſ a diſlocated bone are, inability to move the injured limb ; pain, tenſion, deformity in the part affected ; and ſometimes inflammation, ſubſultus tendinum, and fever : and theſe three laſt are greateſt in partial dislocations. The ſwelling which first appears is always inflammatory; but afterwards a ſecondary ſwelling comes on, ſeemingly œdematous, and probably owing to the preſſure of the lymphatics by the diſlocated bone.</p><p>In judging of the practicability of reducing a luxation, we ought to attend to its nature and extent, the other circumſtances with which it may be complicated, and the length of time which it has continued. When a bone is only partially diſlocated, it is evident that it may be reduced with much more eaſe and certainty than where it is completely diſplaced. It is evident alſo that fracture attending diſlocation muſt render reduction much more difficult and uncertain. Indeed, when both the bones forming the joint are broken, there is the greateſt hazard of its remaining ſtiff during life, even when the greateſt attention has been paid. Luxated bones are moſt eaſily reduced immediately after they are diſplaced : the difficulty indeed of reducing them is generally proportional to the time that has intervened ſince the accident happened. When a bone has been ſome time lodged among the contiguous muſcles, it forms a ſocket for itſelf, and is firmly graſped by the furrounding ſoft parts. The cavity, too, from which it was diſlodged may be partially filled with ſome of the ſurrounding ſoft parts, or at leaſt diminiſhed by the constant action of the contiguous muſcles on its cartilaginous brim. Diſſections, however, ſhow, that inſpiſſated ſynovia does not, as was formerly ſuppoſed, fill up this cavity. In delicate conſtitutions and advanced periods of life, when the muſcles give little reſistance, dislocations are more eaſily reduced than in the vigour of youth or in robuſt conſtitutions.</p><p>In the treatment, we ought, 1. To reduce the diſlocation with as much eaſe and expedition as poſſible; 2. Retain the bone in its ſituation till the parts have recovered their tone; and, 3. Obviate all uneaſy ſymptoms.</p><p>1. When the ſurrounding ſkin and muſcles are much contuſed and inflamed, we ſhould endeavour to remove the inflammation by local blooding, ſaturnme applications, and laying the limb in an eaſy posture, before we attempt to reduce the bone, as conſiderable injury may be done by ſtretching a limb while the parts ſurrounding the joint are inflamed. The upper part oſ the limb ſhould be kept ſteady while the ſurgeon endeavours to replace the under bone, which alone is commonly diſplaced. This is not eaſily done; for the contractile power of the muſcles acts ſtrongly againſt every attempt, and not only draws it beyond the contiguous bone againſt which it ſhould be placed, but frequently forces it out of its natural ſituation, and fixes it firmly in ſome neighbouring cavity, from which it is with difficulty removed. To prevent this reſiſtance as much as poſſible, the muſcles ought to be put into a ſtate of relaxation. If this is properly done, the force neceſſary for reducing a luxated bone may generally be obtained from assiſtants alone ; ſometimes, however, machinery is required, and various instruments have been invented for this purpose. Freke’s machine is the moſt generally uſed. The force ought always to be applied in a gradual manner, and to the diſlocated bone alone, and not to any more diſtant parts of the limb. After the end of the diſlocated bone is brought into a line with that to which it<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0179.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0173"/>
                                                                                                is oppoſed, the reduction is eaſily completed either by the action of the muſcles alone, or, if that is not sufficient, by gentle pressure.</p><p>2. After the reduction there is ſeldom any difficulty in retaining the bone in its place, unleſs it has often been diſlocated before. All that is necessary is to place the limb in a relaxed poſture, and to ſupport the bone with a bandage till the parts have recovered their tone.</p><p>3. The moſt urgent ſymptoms which accompany diſlocations are, pain, inflammation, and ſwelling. Theſe uſually abate ſoon after the reduction. If any degree of inflammation remain, the uſe of leeches is the beſt remedy.</p><p>When diſlocated bones are accompanied with fracture near the joint, the fracture muſt be allowed to heal before reduction be attempted. This, however, is not always neceſſary in very ſmall bones, as thoſe of the fingers. When the fracture is at a diſtance from the joint, the diſlocation may generally be reduced immediately. Compound luxations are to be treated nearly as compound fractures. After the bone is replaced, leeches ſhould be applied to abate the inflammation ; after which the ſore ſhould be dressed with Goulard’s cerate, or any other mild ointment, and the pain moderated by opiates and a low regimen: care ought alſo to be taken that no matter lodge about the joint. When luxations are produced by tumors or collections of matter in the neighbourhood of the joints, they may be conſidered as incurable : when they proceed from too great a relaxation of the ligaments and tendons of the joint, the bone can hardly be prevented from being now and then diſplaced ; but the inconvenience may be ſomewhat obviated by ſupporting the limb with a proper bandage, by the uſe of the cold bath, and by electricity.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Luxations of the Bones of the Head and Neck.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">If</hi> the bones of the cranium be ſeparated by external injury, all that can well be done is, to ſupport the parts by a bandage, to prevent inflammation, to keep the patient quiet, and in a proper poſture during the cure. The bones of the noſe are ſeldom luxated without fracture : when they are, the injury is eaſily discovered by the touch. When one of the bones is driven inwards, it may be raised and reduced by puſhing a tube of a proper ſize, and covered with ſoft lint, into the noſtril ; which may be afterwards retained till there is no danger of the bone being again diſplaced. If the bone be luxated outwards, it may be reduced by the fingers, and retained by a double-headed roller. The lower jaw is luxated moſt frequently when the mouth is opened widely ; it can only take place forwards and downwards, which are leaſt surrounded by the neighbouring parts : both sides are generally luxated at once ; and in that case the mouth is opened wide, the chin thrown forwards and towards the breaſt. When only one side is diſlocated, the mouth is diſtorted, and wideſt on the found side of the jaw, which is drawn a little towards the contrary side. The patient ſhould be ſeated, and his head ſupported. The ſurgeon ſhould puſh his thumbs, protected by a covering of ſtrong leather, as far as poſſiible between the jaws, and then with his fingers, applied on the outside of the angle of the jaw, endeavour to bring it forward till it move a little from its ſituation. He ſhould then preſs it forcibly down, and the condyles will immediately slip into their place. The thumbs ought to be inſtantly withdrawn, as the patient is apt to bite them involuntarily. The patient ſhould for ſome time avoid much speaking or opening his mouth wide.</p><p>When the head is luxated, it commonly falls forward on the breaſt, the patient is inſtantly deprived of ſenſe and motion, and ſoon dies if the luxation be not quickly reduced. In reducing the luxation, the patient ſhould be placed on the ground, and ſupported by an aſſiſtant : the ſurgeon ſtanding behind ſhould gradually pull up the head, while the ſhoulders are preſſed down by the aſſiſtant till the bones are brought into their place, which is known by a ſudden crack or noiſe : if the patient be not dead, he immediately recovers his faculties, at leaſt in ſome meaſure. He ſhould then be put to bed with his head elevated and retained in one poſture. He ſhould lose a quantity of blood, and live for ſome time on a low diet.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Luxations of the Spine, Os Coccygis, Clavicle, and Ribs.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> vertebræ are ſometimes partially, but hardly ever completely, diſlocated without fracture. When they occur high up, they are attended with the ſame ſymptoms as diſlocation of the head : when farther down, beſides diſtortion of the ſpine, paralyſis enſues of every part of the body ſituated under the luxated bone ; there is commonly alſo either a total ſuppression of urine, or it is diſcharged involuntarily together with the faeces. As luxations of this kind are generally owing to falls or violent blows, the diſplaced vertebra is driven either forwards or to one side ; it is therefore very difficult to reduce it. The beſt, as well as the simpleſt method, is to lay the patient on his face over a cylindrical body, as a large caſk, and at the ſame time to attempt to replace the bone with the fingers. If the bone be very much diſplaced, there is very little reaſon to hope for ſucceſs. The os coccygis is more liable to diſiocation than any other part of the ſpine. It is ſometimes forced outwards in laborious births. This is diſcovered by the great pain which is felt at the connection of the os coccygis with the ſacrum, and by the bone appearing to be diſplaced when examined. It may generally be eaſily reduced by preſſute with the fingers. The beſt ſupport afterwards is a compress, with the T bandage. When the coccyx is luxated inwardly, the patient complains of ſevere pain, teneſmus, and a ſenſe of fulneſs in the rectum ; the faeces are passed with difficulty, and in ſome caſes a ſuppression of urine takes place. The injury is eaſily diſcovered by introducing the finger into the anus. In this caſe the bone ſhould be preſſed outwards, by introducing the sore and middle fingers of one hand dipped in oil into the rectum, and ſupporting the parts which correſpond with it externally till the reduction is accompliſhed. Diſlocations of theſe bones are apt to excite inflammation, which often terminates in dangerous abſceſses ; it ought therefore to be guarded against by every means in our power.</p><p>The clavicle is moſt frequently luxated at its junction with the ſternum ; becauſe the violence which produces the injury is generally applied to the ſhoulder. The luxation is diſcovered by pain in the part, by the projection of the bone, and by the immobility of the ſhoulder. It is eaſily reduced by puſhing the bone into its place with the fingers, while an aſſiſtant draws back the arms and ſhoulders. It is not ſo eaſy to retain the bone in its place. When it is the inner extremity of the clavicle which has been diſlocated, the ſhoulder ſhould be kept in its natural ſituation, neither raised nor depreſſed : the fore-arm ſhould be ſupported, as ſhould alſo the head and ſhoulders, and a moderate preſſure ſhould be made upon the diſplaced end of the bone. For this purpoſe the machine represented fig. 104. the invention of Mr Park of Liverpool, anſwers beſt. But when the outer extremity of the clavicle has been diſlocated, the ſhoulder muſt be considerably raised, the arm ſupported in a ſling, and the bone kept in its proper ſituation by a ſmall compreſs placed over its end, and ſecured by a roller forming the figure 8 ; or it may be retained by the<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0180.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0174"/>

The bandage ought to be retained for a conſiderable time.</p><p>Luxations of the ribs are exceedingly rare. The ſymptoms are nearly the ſame with thoſe ariſing from fracture, only that the pain is more ſevere at the articulation, and that no other ſpot but that will yield to pressure. All that can be done is to bend the body forward over a caſk or ſome ſuch body, in order to aſſiſt the viſcera in preſſing out the rib. Bandages are of little uſe. The patient ſhould be kept quiet, and fed on a low diet : inflammation ſhould be prevented, and opiates given if he has a troubleſome cough.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV. <hi rend="italic">Luxation of the Bones of the Superior Extremities.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> head of the os humeri is moſt frequently diſlocated forwards and downwards, sometimes downwards and backwards, but never upwards without a fracture of that part of the ſcapula which is placed above the joint. The luxation is diſcovered by the patient’s inability to raiſe his arm, by violent pain attending the attempt, by the luxated arm being of a different length from the other, by the head of the humerus being felt out of its natural ſituation, while a vacuity is perceived under the acromion, and by the flatneſs of the injured joint, while the sound one has its natural fulneſs. When the luxation is of long ſtanding, the whole arm is apt to become oedematous.</p><p>The patient ſhould be ſeated on a chair, and his body ſecured by a broad belt paſſed round it, and held by aſſiſtants. The elbow ſhould be bent, in order to relax the muscles on the fore part of the luxated joint. A firm leather belt four or five inches broad, with ſtrong ſtraps, and lined with flannel, is to be tied round the arm immediately above the elbow : aſſiſtants are to extend the arm gradually, by pulling theſe ſtraps, while another aſſiſtant draws back the ſcapula. The ſurgeon ſtands on the outside of the arm, directs the aſſiſtants, and varies the direction of the extenſion, according to the ſituation of the head of the bone. As ſoon as the head of the bone has cleared the brim of the socket, the muſcles draw it into its place, a crack is heard, the patient is relieved, and the anterior part of the ſhoulder acquires its uſual fulneſs.</p><p>Various other methods of extending the arm have been propoſed in difficult caſes; as, ſuſpending the patient by the luxated arm over the ſtep of a ladder or the top of a door, raising him up by the arm with ropes running over pulleys fixed in the ceiling of a room, &amp;c. The jerk produced by the body being ſuddenly raiſed and let down again on a feather bed, has ſometimes ſucceeded when other means have failed. A gentler method is to lay the patient on the floor, while two or three stout men ſtanding on a table lay hold of him by the arm and pull him up. But all theſe methods are in danger of lacerating the ſoft parts by the ſuddenneſs with which the force is applied, and even ſometimes of breaking the end of the humerus if it be preſſed againſt the neck of the ſcapula. Mr Freke’s improvement on the ambé of Hippocrates has been conſidered as the beſt machine for extending the arm. But machinery is very ſeldom necessary; even cases of long ſtanding may by proper management be reduced by means of assistants, provided reduction be at all practicable. Inflammation after the operation ſhould be obviated by the uſual remedies. If the bone be apt to ſtep out again, which ſometimes happens after repeated dislocations, the arm ſhould be ſupported in a sling till the parts have recovered their tone. Bliſters, friction, stimulating medicines applied to the ſhoulder, and cold water poured on it, have ſometimes been uſeful in reſtoring the ſtrength of the joint.</p><p>Luxations at the elbow moſt commonly happen upwards and backwards ; and then the fore-arm is shortened, the end of the ulna projects behind, and is higher than usual, while the extremity of the humerus can be felt in the bend of the elbow. The ſurgeon ſhould take hold of the wriſt with one hand, and the upper part of the forearm (which is to be moderately bent) with the other, and gradually pull the top of the fore-arm downwards, while at the ſame time he increaſes the curvature of the elbow to diſengage the ends of the bones from each other. He ſhould then pull the bones forward into their ſituation. When the luxation happens upwards and forwards, it ſhould be reduced while the arm is extended. After the reduction, the muſcles of the fore-arm ſhould be kept relaxed by bending the elbow a little till the parts have recovered their tone. When the bones of the fore-arm are diſlocated from each other, which happens moſt frequently at the wriſt, the rotatory motion of the hand is deſtroyed. After the reduction, the bones ſhould be bound together by a tight flannel roller, or a couple of ſplints ſhould be applied along the fore-arm, and the arm ſupported in a sling.</p><p>The bones of the wriſt are not ſo often luxated as might be expected from the ſmallneſs of their ſize. When they are, great ſwelling and pain enſues, and the motion of the joint is entirely deſtroyed. Great attention is necessary, leſt luxation ſhould be mistaken for a ſprain. The arm and hand ſhould be ſupported by aſſiſtants, but not ſtretched ; and then the bones ſhould be puſhed into their place, and afterwards retained by proper bandages and ſplints. The bones of the metacarpus, when they happen to be diſlocated, which is very ſeldom, are to be reduced in the same manner. Diſlocations of the thumb or fingers are eaſily diſcovered. To reduce them, an aſſiſtant ſhould hold the phalanx from which the dislocation happened, while the ſurgeon endeavours to elevate the bone from the one contiguous to it, and to paſs it into its place.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V. <hi rend="italic">Luxations of the Bones of the inferior Extremities.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">From</hi> the great ſtrength of the hip joint, it was formerly believed that the head of the thigh-bone was never luxated by external violence ; but it is now known that it happens by no means unfrequently. The ball in ſtarting from its ſocket gencrally passes forwards and downwards into the foramen thyroideum. When this happens, the limb is conſiderably lengthened, the head of the bone is lodged near the under and fore part of the pelvis, the large trochanter is obſerved on the fore part of the thigh, a vacancy is perceived where the head of the bone and the trochanter ſhould be, and the toes are turned outwards. When the bone is diſlocated upwards and backwards, the limb is ſhortened, the great trochanter higher than uſual, the knee and foot turned inwards. When it is diſlocated upwards and forwards, the leg is ſhortened, the ball of the bone is felt on the os pubis in the groin, and the great trochanter on the upper and lower part of the thigh ; a vacancy is diſcovered in the correſponding part of the hip; the knee and toes are turned outwards. When the ball slips downwards and backwards, the leg is lengthened, the toes turned inwards, and the great trochanter is lower than that of the other limb. If the ball slip directly downwards, the leg is lengthened, but the knee and toes keep nearly their natural ſituation. It is ſometimes difficult to diſtinguiſh between luxation and fracture of the neck of the bone. In fractures the bone is moſt frequently puſhed upwards, and the leg ſhortened, the knee and point of the toes are turned inwards, and may be moved much more readily outwards and inwards than when the bone is diſlocated.<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0181.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0175"/>
                                                                                                        For reduction, the patient ſhould be laid on a mattreſs on the ſound side, and a wooden roller covered with ſeveral folds of flannel placed between his thighs, and fixed firmly by ſtraps to the wall. A ſtrong bandage of buff leather, or ſomething ſimilar, ſhould be applied to the under end of the thigh, with ſtraps fixed to it to make the extenſion. The trunk of the body ſhould be properly ſecured, and the joint of the knee bent. The extenſion ſhould be made at firſt gently, and increaſed gradually, while, at the ſame time, the thigh is made to roll in different directions. When the extenſion is sufficient, two aſſiſtants ſhould lay hold of the roller, and attempt to raiſe the bone ; the extending force ſhould then be ſlackened, and the ſurgeon ſhould puſh the head of the bone upwards and outwards, while an aſſiſtant preſſes the knee forcibly inwards. The muſcles themſelves will then commonly bring the bone into its place; and this is done with ſuch a jerk and noiſe, that it is heard by the byſtanders. If the reduction be not obtained, the extenſion muſt be repeated with greater force. Inſtead of the roller a broad ſtrap or table cloth is frequently uſed. The limb ſhould not be uſed for ſome time after reduction, and inflammation ſhould be prevented by the proper remedies.</p><p>The patella can neither be luxated upwards or downwards, without rupture of the tendons of the extenſors muſcles, or of the ſtrong ligament which fixes it to the tibia ; but it may be luxated to either side. The luxation produces lameneſs, and much pain on attempting to move the joint. In recent caſes the injury is eaſily diſcovered ; but when the ſurgeon is not called immediately, the ſwelling may be ſo great as to render it more difficult. For reduction, the limb ſhould be kept extended ; the ſurgeon, by depreſſing the edge of the patella most diſtant from the joint, is enabled to raiſe the other, and puſh the bone into its place.</p><p>It may be necessary to remain a day or two in bed till the knee recover its tone. Sometimes, after the bone has been displaced, returns of the ſame complaint become frequent. In ſuch caſes, proper machinery applied to the side of the tumor, where the bone is apt to ſtart out, is uſed with advantage.</p><p>From the ſize of the joint, and the great ſtrength of the ligaments, luxations of the tibia from the os femoris rarely occur. When it does, it is eaſily diſcovered by the pain, lameneſs, and deformity of the limb. The patient ſhould be laid on a table, the muſcles relaxed, and the thigh ſecured by aſſiſtants ; the limb ſhould then be extended, and the bones cleared of each other, when they will be eaſily replaced. After the reduction, the limb ſhould remain for ſome time perfectly at reſt ; and inflammation, which is very apt to enſue, and is attended with very bad conſequences, ſhould be aſſiduouſly guarded againſt.</p><p>If the ankle joint be diſlocated forwards, the fore part of the foot is lengthened ; if backwards, the foot is ſhortened and the heel lengthened (this is the moſt common variety) ; if to either side, there is an uncommon vacancy on the one side, and a prominency on the other. Diſlocation, however, can hardly take place outwardly without fracture of the end of the fibula.</p><p>For reduction, the limb ſhould be firmly held by aſſiſtants, the muſcles relaxed, and extenſion made till the bones are cleared of each other, when the aſtragulus will eaſily slip into its place.—The ſame rules ſhould be obſerved in reducing diſlocations of the bones of the foot.

In that case, the opinion muſt be regulated, not only by the attendant symptoms, but, lſt, By the age and habit of the patient ; for bones are more eaſily fractured in old than in young perſons. Different diseases, too, induce brittleneſs of the bones, as the lues venerea and ſea-ſcurvy. 2d, By the ſituation of the part ; for bones are more apt to be fractured in the ſolid parts of their bodies than towards their extremities, where they are more ſoft and pliant. 3d, By the poſture of the limb ; for a weight may fracture a bone lying on an unequal ſurface, which it would have ſuſtained without injury if equally ſupported. Fractures are ſometimes attended with a great degree of echymoſis, occaſioned by the ends of the fractured bones wounding ſome of the contiguous blood-veſſels.</p><p>In giving a prognoſis of fracture, various circumſtances are to be attended to. It is evident that ſmall fractured bones are more eaſily healed than large ones, and that the fracture of the middle of a bone is not near ſo dangerous as near the extremity. A cure is effected much more readily in youth than in old age, and in good conſtitutions than in bad. We ought alſo to attend to the concomitant symptoms, and the injury which the neighbouring parts may have ſuſtained. The more moderate the symptoms, the more favourable our prognoſis may be.</p><p>The treatment of fractures conſiſt of three particulars ; replacement, retention, and obviating bad symptoms.</p><p>1. When bones are fractured directly across the parts, they are often very little moved from their natural ſituation ; but when the fracture is oblique, they are apt to paſs over each other, and to produce much uneaſineſs and deformity ; the contiguous muſcles are severely injured, and the pain is aggravated by the ſlighteſt motion. The ſurgeon ſhould put the limb into the beſt poſture for relaxing all the muſcles connected with it, according to the practice firſt introduced by Mr Pott. If it be properly attended to, the ends of the bones will in general be eaſily replaced. When any difficulty occurs, a ſmall degree of extenſion may be made, taking care to keep the muſcles as relaxed as poſſible. Much attention ſhould be paid to replacing the bones properly, otherwise the limb will remain for ever after diſtorted,</p><p>2. After the bones are replaced, the limb ſhould be laid in the easieſt poſture, and the bones afterwards retained; in their ſituation by proper compreſſes and bandages, not applied too tightly, till the cure be completed. The time necessary for this purpoſe depends on the ſize of the bone, the age and habit of the patient, the ſteadineſs with which the limb has been retained in its place, and the violence of<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0182.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0176"/>
                                                                                                            the attending ſymptoms. In middle-aged perſons, and under favourable circumstances, a fracture of the thigh bone, or of the bones oſ the leg, may be cured in two months ; of the arm bone, or bones of the fore arm, in six weeks ; of the ribs, clavicles, and bones of the hand, in three weeks. In infancy the cure will take a ſhorter, and in old age a longer, time than this.</p><p>3. In ſimple fractures the inflammatory ſymptoms generally ſubſide in a few days. When they become worſe, which is ſometimes the case, aſtringent applications ſhould be employed. If theſe fail, blood ought to be drawn from the parts affected. This is of ſo much advantage, that it ought never to be omitted where the ſurrounding ſoft parts are much injured. Friction with emollient oils, warm bathing, the uſe of Bath and other ſimilar waters, are alſo of much ſervice. The limb ſometimes puts on a clumſy appearance from an overgrowth of callus. When this tendency appears, ardent ſpirits and other aſtringents are conſidered as uſeful ; ſometimes pressure on the part by a thin plate of lead fixed by a bandage may be advantageous. Many inſtances occur, however, where no remedies prove ſucceſsful: The patient ought therefore to be acquainted beforehand with the probable event, to prevent unpleaſant reflections afterwards.</p><p>Sometimes the ends of the bone remain looſe long after they might have been reunited. This may be owing to ſome conſtitutional diſeaſe, to the bones not being kept ſteadily in contact, to ſome of the ſoft parts getting in between them, or to the bone being broken in different places, and the intermediate fractures being too ſmall to adhere. Pregnancy has alſo been mentioned as a cauſe. By removing theſe obſtructions, a perfect union may in recent caſes be accompliſhed. But where the caſe is of long ſtanding, callus of the bones becomes ſo hard and ſmooth as to move with the eaſe of a joint, ſo that no advantage can be derived from laying them together. In that case, an inciſion ſhould be made through the ſoft parts, and a ſmall portion of the ends of the bone removed with a ſaw. If this be properly performed, nature will ſupply the deficiency. When ſmall pieces of bone remain long looſe, they ſhould be extracted by making an opening. The intervention of muſcles or other ſoft parts is known by the very ſevere pain and tenſion, and by particular motions of the limb cauſing great pain and twitching of the muſcles which move it. The limb ſhould be put into all the variety of ſituation; and if this does not ſucceed, an opening must be made, and the ſoft parts removed. Sometimes in fractures blood-vessels are ruptured by the ſharp spiculæ of the bone : this happens moſt commonly in compound fractures. When the effuſion of blood is great, the part ſwells ſo much that it is neceſſary to lay it open, and to ſecure the divided vessels by a ligature. When the ſwelling is not great, the abſorption of the blood is truſted to nature. When the blood remains long in contact with the fractured bone, it ſometimes prevents the formation of callus ; the perioſteum ſeparates from a conſiderable portion of the bone, and a thin fetid ſanies is diſcharged at the wound. When this happens, no cure can be expected till the parts of the bone deprived of perioſteum have exfoliated, or have been ſeparated by a ſaw.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Fractures of the Bones of the Face.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fractures</hi> of the noſe may impede reſpiration, affect the ſpeech and ſenſe of ſmelling, give rise to polypi and tedious ulcers, and may beſides be dangerous from their vicinity to the brain. When any part of the bones of the noſe has been raiſed above the reſt, it is to be preſſed into its place with the fingers ; if it has been puſhed into the noſtril, it is to be raiſed with the end oſ a ſpatula or other ſimilar inſtrument. If any portion be almoſt entirely separated from the reſt, it ſhould be removed ; but if it adheres with conſiderable firmneſs, it is to be replaced. If the bones, after being replaced, do not remain in their proper ſituation, they are to be retained either by tubes introduced into the noſtrils, or by a double-headed roller, with proper compreſſes as the caſe may require. Inflammation ſhould be prevented by the proper remedies.</p><p>Much care is necessary in replacing the fractured bones of the face, and in dreſſing them, in order to prevent deformity. The dreſſings may be retained by adheſive plaſters. Inflammation, by which the eyes, noſe, or antrum maxillare is apt to be injured, ſhould be prevented. When matter collects in the antrum, it is to be removed by the metthods formerly deſcribed.</p><p>For replacing fractures of the lower jaw, the patient ſhould be ſeated in a proper light, with his head firmly ſecured. The ſurgeon ſhould preſs with one hand on the inside of the bone, while with the other he guards againſt inequalities on the outſide. If a tooth come in the way, it ſhould be extracted ; when any of the others are forced out of their ſockets, they ſhould be replaced, and tied to the neighbouring teeth till they become firm. The fractured parts being kept firm by an aſſiſtant, a thick compreſſs of linen or cotton ſhould be laid over the chin, and made to extend from ear to ear over it ; a four-headed roller ſhould. be applied firm enough to keep the fractured parts in contact. The patient ſhould be kept quiet during the cure, and fed upon ſpoon-meat. The dreſſings ſhould be removed as ſeldom as poſſible. When the fracture is accompanied with an external wound, the parts ſhould be ſupported by an aſſiſtant during the dreſſing of it.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Fractures of the Clavicles, Ribs, Sternum, and Spine.</hi></p><p>A <hi rend="smallcaps">fracture</hi> of the clavicle is eaſily diſcovered by the grating noiſe in the fractured bone upon moving the arm freely, by the ends of the bone yielding to pressure, and by the motion of the humerus being impeded. All that can be done is to raiſe the arm, and ſupport it at a pιroper height, either by a sling, or, which is better, by the leather caſe recommended in caſe of luxation of this bone. By this the fractured parts will be brought together, ſo far at leaſt as to prevent deformity, and render the bone sufficiently ſtrong.</p><p>Fractures of the ribs are diſcovered by pressures with the fingers. The ſymptoms are commonly moderate, and the patient ſoon gets well. In ſome caſes, however, the pain is ſevere, the breathing becomes difficult, attended with cough, and perhaps with ſpitting of blood, and the pulſe is quick, full, and ſometimes oppreſſed. Theſe ſymptoms ariſe from the ribs being beat in on the lungs.</p><p>In the treatment, it is proper in every caſe to discharge ſome blood. If one end of the rib rise, it ought to be repreſſed by moderate pressure ; and to prevent its rising again, a broad leather belt ſhould be applied pretty tight, and continued for ſome weeks. When a portion of the rib is forced inwards, an opening ſhould be made over it with a ſcalpel, and then it ſhould be elevated with the fingers or a forceps. When diſtreſſing ſymptoms proceed from air or blood collected in the cavity of the cheſt, theſe fluids ought to be diſcharged by an operation.</p><p>The ſymptoms of a fractured ſternum are nearly the ſame with those of the ribs. It requires great attention frorm the vicinity of the heart and large blood-vessels. The patient ought to loſe a quantity of blood, and be kept on an anti- phlogiſtic regimen.

Should this be inſufficient, it may be affected by means of the trepan : this indeed requires the greatest caution, but it may certainly be attended with advantage when the patient’s life is in danger.</p><p>Fractures of the vertebræ generally end fatally. We judge of the existence of fracture there by examining the parts, by the ſeverity of the pain, and by palsy occurring in the parts ſituated below the injured part.</p><p>When any parts of the vertebræ near the integuments are loosie, they may be replaced with the fingers, and retained by proper bandages. When this is impoſſible, ſome of the latest authors think it adviſable to make an inciſion, and raise any portions of the bone which may be depreſſed.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV. F <hi rend="italic">racture of the Bones of the Superior Extremities.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> ſcapula is ſeldom fractured; when it is, the fracture is eaſily diſcovered by the pain, the immobility of the arm, and by the touch. The parts may be replaced with greater eaſe if the muſcles connected with them be relaxed. They are retained with difficulty. A long roller ſhould be employed for this purpoſe, with which the head and ſhoulders are alsp to be ſupported. The arm ſhould alſo be ſuſpended to relax the muſcles as much as poſſible, and inflammationi particularly guarded against by local bloodings.</p><p>fractures of the humerus are easily diſcovered by the pain, the immobility of the arm, and a grating noiſe on handling the parts. In reducing the fracture, the muſcles ſhould be completely relaxed by bending the arm and raising it to a horizontal posture. Extenſion, if neceſſary, may be made by one aſſiſtant graſping the arm between the fracture; and the ſhoulder, and another between the fracture and the elbow. After the reduction, one ſplint covered with flannel ſhould be laid along the whole outſide, and another along the whole inside of the arm; and then a flannel roller applied ſufficiently tight to ſupport the parts without interrupting the circulation. The arm may either be ſupported in a sling or Mr Park's leather caſe, (fig. 104). The bandages ſhould not be removed or several days, unleſs ſome urgennt symptoms render it neceſſary. In about a week, however, the arm ſhould be examined to ſee whether the bones have been properly ſet.</p><p>When both of the bones of the fore-arm are broken, the fracture is easily diſcovered ; but when only one bone is fractured, eſpecially if it be the radius, the firmneſs of the other renders the difcovery more difficult ; the grating noiſe, however, on moving the bone in different directions, will generally be a sufficient ſymptom that a fracture has taken place. When the fracture happens near the wriſt, particular attention is neccessary in order to prevent a ſtiff joint. In order to replace the parts, the muſcles are to be relaxed by bending the joints of the elbow and wriſt, and the limb extended a little above and below the fracture. After reduction, a ſplint reaching from the elbow to the ends of the fingers is to the applied along the radius, and another along the ulna ; and both are to be ſecured with a roller or twelve tailed bandage. When the ſplints are applied, the palms ſhould be turned towards the breaſt as the moſt convenient poſture. The arm ſhould be hung in a sling. A partial dislocation of the bones of the wriſt ſometimes attends a fracture of the radius, by which a stiff joint, under the beſt practice, is apt to mine, or permanent painful ſwellings of the sore arm. In ſuch caſes, the patient ought to be warned of the danger, that no blame may be afterwards incurred.</p><p>When the olecrarum is fractured, the arm muſt be kept in am extended ſtate during the cure, by applying a ſplint opposite to the joint of the elbow, reaching from the middle of the humerus to the points of the fingers. The arm ſhould be hung by the patient’s side, to which it ſhould be fixed by means of ſtraps. To prevent the conſequences of a ſtiff joint, the dreſſings ſhould be removed about the eighth or tenth day, the fore-arm for ſome time slowly moved backwards and forwards, and the joint rubbed with an emolient oil. By a repetition of this at proper intervals, a ſtiff joint may be prevented.</p><p>Anchyloſis, or ſtiffneſs of the joint, commonly ſucceeds fractures of the bones of the wriſt, owing to the great inflammation which enſues, and to their not readily reuniting from their ſmallneſs. To prevent this as much as poſſible, after replacing the bones, the injured parts ſhould be leeched freely, and in proportion to the violence of the ſymptoms. Splints ſhould be applied exactly as in fractures of the fore-arm, and the arm ſupported by a sling.</p><p>In fractures of the metacarpal bones, a firm ſplint ſhould be applied over the whole palm and inside of the arm, from the points of the fingers to the elbow, in order to prevent the action oſ the flexors of the fingers. The beſt ſplint for a fractured finger is a piece of firm paſteboard properly fitted and ſoftened in water till it can be readily moulded into the form of the part. This ſhould be applied along the whole length of the finger, and ſecured with a narrow roller. At the ſame time, a large roller ſhould be applied over the inside of the hand to prevent the parts from being moved. To prevent ſtiffness, the dreſſings ſhould be removed about the end of the second week, and the joint cautiously bent; and this ſhould be repeated daily till the cure be completed.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V. <hi rend="italic">Erasures of the Bones of the inferior Extremities.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fractures</hi> of the body of the thigh bone are readily diſcovered by the grating noiſe when the ends of the bones are forcibly rubbed together, by the ſhortness of the limb if the fracture be oblique, and by the limb being unable to ſuſtain the body. But fractures of the neck of the bone are often not easily diſtinguished from dislocation of the joint. In general they may be diſtinguiſhed by the circumſtances mentioned in treating of luxations of this bone. In forming a prognoſis, we ought to conſider that no fractures are more apt to diſappoint our expectations than thoſe of the thigh, eſpecially when the neck of the bone is broken, owing to the difficulty of diſcovering the place of the fracture, and of retaining the bones even after they have been replaced. In order to reduce fractures of the thigh, the muſcles are to be relaxed by moderately bending the joints of the thigh and knee : w hen this is done, unleſs there be much pain and tenſion, the bones are easily replaced by one aſſiſtant holding the upper part of the thigh, while another ſupports and gently pulls down its lower extremity, while the ſurgeon is employed in adjuſting the fractured pieces. It is more difficult to reduce fractures of the neck of the bone, on account of the great ſtrength and various directions of the surrounding muſcles. In general, however, we ſhall succeed by moderate extenſion, if we take care previouſly to relax all the muſcles as much as poſſible ; if we do not ſucceed, we muſt have recourſe to machinery.</p><p>The greateſt difficulty is to retain the bones in their situation after they are replaced. The limb muſt be firmly ſecured by ſplints made of thin slips of wood glued to leather (fig 105. <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b),</hi> or of thick paſteboard. One ſplint, broad enough to cover half of the thigh, ſhould reach from the top of the hip joint to a little below the knee, and another, covering about a third part of the thigh, from the groin to a little below the knee. The ſplints ſhould be lined with flannel. They are to be ſecured by a twelve-tailed bandage, and over all a thin pillow ſhould be put nearly as long as<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0184.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0178"/>
                                                                                                                    the thigh. The ſplints and bandages may be put on in the following manner: The patient being placed on a firm hair mattreſs, with his knee moderately bent, the long ſplint bandage and pillow are to be applied to the outſide of the thigh, and the patient ſhould be turned ſomewhat towards the affected side, with the knee and leg raised a little higher than the body : the ſhort ſplint ſhould then be applied along the inside of the thigh, and the bandage already placed without the other ſplint, applied ſo tight as to make an equal moderate preſſure over the whole : (See fig. 106.). To make the part ſtill more ſecure, it is proper to inſert a long firm ſplint of timber under the middle of the pillow, and to fix it by two broad ſtraps to the upper part of the limb. To prevent the limb from being affected by involuntary ſtartings, the pillow ſhould be fixed to the bed by ſtraps : to keep off the weight of the bed-clothes, a frame with hoops ſhould be placed over the thigh. The parts ſhould be examined after ſome time to see that the bones be not diſplaced. When there is pain, ſwelling, and inflammation, leeches and other remedies ſhould be applied. To render the ſituation of the patient as eaſy as poſſible during the cure, he may be allowed after the second week to turn a little more towards his back, and at the ſame time to extend the joint of the knee in a ſmall degree : after this time a little flexion and extenſion of the limb may be daily repeated to preſerve the uſe of the joint.</p><p>The method here deſcribed generally ſucceeds. Sometimes, however, notwithſtanding all our care, the ends of the bone slip over each other. To prevent the deformity which this occaſions, it has been attempted to make extenſion and counter-extenſion by machines : but the pain and irritation have always been ſo great that little advantage has yet been derived from such means. The invention (fig. 107.) of the late Mr Gooch of Norwich, improved by the late Dr Aitken of Edinburgh, has been recommended as one of the beſt machines for oblique fractures of the thigh. After endeavouring to remove the pain, ſwelling, and inflammation, which are ſometimes ſo great as to preclude the application of the ſimpleſt bandage, this machine may be tried. But if it be found impracticable to uſe it, the cure muſt be conducted in the uſual way with the chance of the fractured pieces overlapping one another, and of courſe the limb being ſomewhat ſhortened.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">patella</hi> is moſt frequently fractured tranſverſely, ſometimes lengthwise, and ſometimes into ſeveral pieces. Fractures of this bone have been ſaid commonly to end in a ſtiff joint ; but this is perhaps moſt frequently owing to the limb being kept too long in an extended poſture. In the treatment of fractures of this bone, the leg ſhould be extended to relax as much as poſſible the soft parts connected with the bone. The patient ſhould be placed on a firm mattreſs, and a ſplint be placed under the limb long enough to reach from the top of the thigh to the under end of the leg, to which the limb ſhould be fixed by a number of ſtraps to keep it in a ſtate of extenſion. The fractured bones are then to be brought together, and ſuch a number of leeches applied to the joint as will remove as much blood as the patient can bear ; and as long as much pain and tenſion continue, ſaturnine and other aſtringents are to be uſed for removing them. When this is accompliſhed, and the parts properly adjuſted, a large pledget of Goulard’s cerate ſhould be laid over the joint, and a hooped frame employed to keep off the bed-clothes. In a longitudinal fracture the parts are eaſily kept together by a common uniting bandage or adheſive plaſter ; but in tranſverſe fractures more force is neceſſary. Various bandages have been employed for drawing the pieces together in ſuch fractures ; one of the beſt of theſe is that repreſented fig. 108. We need not be anxious, however, about bringing the pieces very cloſe together, as a cure may be made though they remain at a conſiderable diſtance. The bandages, unleſs particular ſymptoms occur, ſhould not be removed till the end of the ſecond week ; after which the joint ſhould be cautiouſly bent every ſecond day to prevent stiffness.</p><p>The leg is commonly fractured near the lower end, this being the weakeſt part of the bones. In the treatment of a fractured leg the ſame rules apply which were given for a fractured thigh bone. The muſcles ſhould be relaxed by bending the knee ; but little advantage can be derived from bending the foot, for in proportion as the muſcles behind are relaxed thoſe before are put on the ſtretch : the patient may be therefore allowed to keep the foot in the eaſieſt poſture. The bones are commonly replaced by the gentle extenſion of the upper part of the limb by an aſſiſtant, while another ſupports it at the ankle. The bones being replaced, and the limb laid on its outſide with the knee bent, two ſplints (fig. 109.) are to be applied, long enough to reach from the upper part of the knee to the edge of the ſole, ſo as to prevent the motion both of the knee and ankle. The ſplints are to be retained by a twelve-tailed bandage, as in the caſe of fractured thigh bone. See fig. 106.</p><p>If the patient be either very reſtleſs or troubled with ſpaſmodic affections of the muſcles of the leg, an additional ſplint, ſhaped to the form of the leg, ſhould be applied along the outſide of it, and fixed by a ſtrap at the upper, and another at the under part of the leg. When the patient cannot reſt when lying on either side, he may be placed on his back, and the curved ſtate of the knee ſtill preſerved by raiſing the leg a little above the level of the body on a frame made for the purpoſe. This variety of poſture may like- wiſe be uſed in fractures of the thigh. The patient may from the firſt be laid in this poſture, or he may alternately change from the one to the other. No change of poſture, however, ſhould be allowed for the firſt ten or twelve days. When the fibula only is fractured, it is apt to be conſidered as a ſprain of ſome of the muſcles ; but this ought to be particularly attended to, as the miſtake may be followed by bad conſequences. When both the bones of the leg are broken, the portion next the foot is commonly drawn towards the back part of the leg, ſo that a prominency is produced by the fractured part of the upper portion of the bone ; and this is improperly termed the rising end of the fractured bone. The appearance is entirely produced by the inferior portion falling back. Hence no advantage is derived from preſſure being made on the upper end of the bone : the inferior portion ſhould be raiſed ſo as to bring the parts into contact, and then by proper bandages they ought to be ſupported till they are perfectly united.</p><p>Fractures of the bones of the foot and toes are treated nearly in the ſame manner as fractures of the hand and fingers. Beſides the ſplint which may be neceſſary for the particular part, a large one ſhould be appled over the ſole ; nor ſhould any motion be allowed for a conſiderable time either in the foot or ankle, otherwiſe the bones may be displaced, and a proper cure prevented.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VI. <hi rend="italic">Of Compound Fractures.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">By</hi> compound fracture is now generally meant a fracture of a bone communicating with an external wound in the integuments. They are much more dangerous than simple fractures. The generality of authors have conſidered amputation as indiſpenſable in cases of compound fractures ; while a few, particularly Mr Bilguer, ſurgeon-general to the armies of the late king of Pruſſia, affirm that it is scarcely ever neceſſary.

                                                                                                                        mended never to amputate immediately in private practice, unleſs when the bones are ſo much ſhattered that they cannot reunite, or the texture of the ſoft parts completely deſtroyed ; becauſe, even if amputation be at laſt necessary, the patient will have a greater chance of recovering than if it had been performed immediately after the accident : for the ſtate of weakneſs to which he is generally reduced render the attendant ſymptoms leſs violent. On the other hand, it has been conſidered as no bad rule in the army or navy, where patients cannot be kept in a proper ſituation, and where sufficient attention cannot be given, to amputate immediately in caſes of compound fractures of the large bones of the extremities. When amputation is not performed immediately, it is not, for ſeveral days at leaſt, admiſſible. It may afterwards be rendered necessary by hemorrhagies, which cannot be stopped but by means more dangerous than amputation itſelf; by extenſive mortification ; or by the ends of the fractured bones remaining long disunited, while a great discharge of matter endangers the patient’s life.</p><p>In treating compound fractures, all extraneous bodies ſhould be removed, as alſo all thoſe ſmall pieces of bone which will probably not unite with the rest. For this purpoſe the opening, if necessary, ſhould be enlarged with a ſcalpel. The next step is to replace the bones by relaxing the muſcles as in ſimple fractures. Sometimes part of a bone projects ſo far through the integuments that it cannot be replaced without either ſawing off the end of it, or enlarging the wound. If the fractured bone be long, ſharp, and projecting much, it is beſt to ſaw it off ; for though it were reduced, it would not readily reunite, and it would be apt to excite much pain and inflammation : But if it be broad at the baſe, and of no great length, it ought certainly to be ſawed, even though it cannot be reduced without enlarging the wound. For the most part, it is only the ſkin which it is necessary to cut ; but even the muſcles ought to be divided, though as much as poſſible in the direction of their fibres, when the bone cannot otherwiſe be replaced. After the reduction, a pledget of ſome emollient ointment is to be laid over the wound, and the limb placed on a firm ſplint, and still kept in a relaxed posture. In dreſſing the wound, the limb ought not to be moved : the manytailed bandage, therefore, ſhould be uſed rather than a roller. Various contrivances have been fallen upon to allow the limb to be at reſt while the ſurgeon is dreſſing it. The fracture box, invented by the late Mr Rae ſurgeon in Edinburgh, is one of the best. When the leg is laid on this, it may be dressed with tolerable facility without moving it. We are happy to have it in our power to announce to the gentlemen of the medical faculty, that another machine has lately been invented by Mr Samuel James ſurgeon in Hoddeſden, Herts, which, we are told, will effectually relax the muscles, and retain the bones in their natural ſituation, without pain to the patient or the leaſt inconvenience to the operator. See fig. 110.</p><p>It is of the greateſt importance to prevent inflammation, which is apt either to produce mortification, or to give riſe to extenſive abſcesses. The dreſſings ſhould be removed once or twice daily according to the quantity of matter. The common application of warm poultices, on account of their inconvenience, may be deferred till they become necessary by the approach of inflammation, which they are to be conſidered as the ſureſt means of preventing by exciting a discharge of matter. Whenever the inflammation subsides, and a free diſcharge of pus is produced, the poultices ought to be laid aside, lest they do harm by relaxing the parts too much, and exciting too copious a diſcharge. The ſore ought then to be dressed with mild astringents, and the patient kept on a nouriſhing diet with tonic medicines. A free paſſage ſhould be given to the matter by putting the limb in a favourable poſture, and by making a counter opening, if necessary, to the moſt depending part. But this may be frequently avoided, by covering the sore with ſoft lint or ſponge to abſorb the matter. If the diſcharge become exceſſive, and cannot be leffened by the means above-mentioned, it will be found to proceed from a portion of looſe bone which has not been earlier noticed, by the removal of which it may be stopt. If, instead of producing matter, the inflammation terminate in gangrene, the danger is still greater than under the most extenſive abſcesses. For the treatment of this, the reader is referred to Chap. III. Sect. 2d.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXXIIΓ. <hi rend="italic">Of Distortions.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Distortions</hi> of the bones may ariſe from external injuries, from diſeaſed constitutions, from a morbid state of the bones, or a contracted state of the muſcles, or both ; but the affection is most frequently owing to a weakly, delicate conſtitution, as in rickety or ſcrophulous caſes.</p><p>In the treatment of distortions of the ſpine, particular attention ought to be paid to the cauſe of the diſorder. If it appear to ariſe from the patient continuing too long in any particular posture, every habit of this kind ſhould be guarded against on the first appearance of the diſeaſe. If the patient has turned too much to one ſide, the reverſe of this ſhould be adviſed. He ought to ſleep upon a firm hair mattress, that his body may lie upon an equal ſurface. He ſhould uſe an invigorating diet, the cold bath, bark, and other tonics. By a ſtrict attention to the uſe of theſe remedies the diſeaſe has ſometimes been retarded in its progreſs. Various machines have been invented for removing distortions of the ſpine by pressure ; but conſiderable caution is here required, otherwiſe much injury may ariſe from it. Some advantage, however, in certain caſes, has been derived from the uſe of the common collar (fig. 111.) ; or the stays and machinery adapted to them (fig. 112.), invented in France, and aſterwards brought into uſe in this country by Mr Jones of London, are found to be still better ſuited to this purpoſe.</p><p>The ſame cauſes which produce distortions of the ſpine may likewiſe produce distortions of the limbs. Sometimes the distortion takes place with the original formation of the bones, at other times it occurs in infancy, and now and then at a more advanced period of life. In early infancy the bones are ſo pliable as to be readily affected by the poſtures of the body. When a child is too ſoon allowed to attempt to walk, its legs are apt to become crooked from their inability to ſupport the weight of the body. Certain diſeaſes like- wise, eſpecially rickets, soften the bones ſo much, that they yield to the posture of the body, and to the common action of their muſcles.</p><p>When the distortion of a limb is owing to a curvature in a bone, if the caſe be recent, and eſpecially if it occur in childhood, it may frequently be removed, without much difficulty, by making a gradual but constant preſſure, by the uſe of machinery, on the convex ſide of the limb, till it recover its natural appearance. When the deformity occurs in the leg, a method has been uſed, in ſeveral instances, which is to fix a firm ſplint of iron, lined with leacher, in the ſhoe, on the concave ſide of the leg, the other end of the ſplint to rest against the under end of the thigh; when, if a broad strap or two be applied round the leg and ſplint, an eaſy gradual pressure may be made, and conſiderable advantage derived from it. See fig. 113.</p><p>Along with the curvature above mentioned, it commonly happens that the feet and ankles are affected. When the bones of the leg are bent outward, the fore part of the foot is turned inward, and the inner edge upwards ; and the reverſe, if the leg be bent inward. In theſe caſes the affec-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0186.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0180"/>

By removing the curvature of theſe, the foot will commonly regain its natural situation, and the ſplint above mentioned will for the most part be ſufficient for the purpoſe. But in caſes where the ſole of the foot is turned much out of its natural direction, it may be neceſſary to fix the ſplint and ſhoe to a frame (fig. 114.), which will render the cure still more effectual.</p><p>Beſides the inſtrument already mentioned, ſome have uſed a kind of boot, cut lengthwise, made of hardened leather or of metal, &amp;c. which may in some caſes sufficiently anſwer the purpoſe.</p><p>In caſes of club-foot, where the diſtortion is in the middle of the foot, a pair of shoes, such as are repreſented in fig. 115. have been found useful. After the feet are fixed in the ſhoes, the fore part of the feet may be ſeperated by means of a ſcrew in two plates, which are fixed to the ſole.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXXIV. <hi rend="italic">Of Amputation.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">Of imputation in general.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> amputation, which in ſurgery ſignifies cutting off a limb, the great end to be aimed at is, the procuring of a handsome ſtump, in which the bone may not protrude, but be well covered with fleſh ; ſo that no excoriation or rawneſs may be apt to take place. As long ago as the year 1679, it was proposed by Jacob Young, an Engliſh ſurgeon, in a treatiſe intitled <hi rend="italic">Currus Triumphalis ex Terebinthino,</hi> to preſerve a flap of fleſh and ſkin, which was to be folded over the bone, and which, uniting to the parts of the wound after amputation, would effectually cover the bone, and prevent the inconveniences above mentioned. No traces of the ſucceſs of this method, however, can be found till the year 1696 ; when a Latin diſſertation was publiſhed upon it by P. Adrians Verduin, an eminent ſurgeon in Amſterdam. The moſt ſanguine expectations were formed of its ſucceſs ; and it was even thought that the flap would prevent the neccessity of tying up the blood-vessels. However, it does not appear that the method as at that time practiſed either did or could succeed ; and accordingly it was entirely laid aſide ; but it has been lately revived with conſiderabſe improvements.</p><p>Amputation may be rendered neceſſary when a member is ſo much diſeaſed as to be uſeleſs, or when it puts life in danger.</p><p>The cauſes in general rendering this operation neceſſary are, bad compound fractures ; extenſive lacerated and contuſed wounds ; part of the limb being carried off by a cannon ball or otherwiſe, the bones being unequally broken and not properly covered ; extenſive mortification ; white swellings of the joints ; large exoſtoſes ; ulcers attended with extensive caries; cancer or other incurable ulcers; varicose kinds <hi rend="italic">of</hi> tumors ; particular diſtortions of the bones.</p><p>Amputation may alſo be ſometimes necessary from violent hemorrhagies of some principal artery during the cure of a fractured limb, or from ſuch a profuſe diſcharge of matter taking place that the ſtrength of the patient is exhauſted. Lacerated and contused wounds may require amputation, on account of hemorrhagy enſuing which cannot be stopped. Extenſive mortification may take place, and ſuch large quantities of matter be formed, that the patient will be unable to bear up under the diſcharge</p><p>Where part of the limb is carried off, it is neceſſary to amputate higher up, to as to cut the bone, as well as the ſoft parts, in ſuch a manner as may admit of a much speedier and ſafer cure. When mortification occurs, every thing ought to be done for the ſupport of the patient till the diſeaſe be stopped ; the first ſign of which is, the appearance of an inflamed circle between the diſeaſed and ſound parts. As ſoon as the diſeaſed begin to ſeparate from tlne found parts, amputation of the limb ought to be performed, and no time ought now to be lost, loſt the patient ſuffer from the abſorption of putreſcent matter.</p><p>No part of ſurgery is brought to greater perfection than the manner of performing amputation. Before the invention of the tourniquet, and the method of ſecuring the veſels by ligature, the operation was ſeldom undertaken ; and a great proportion of thoſe upon whom it was performed died ſoon after. In the preſent improved method, one death does not happen in twenty, or even thirty caſes. In performing the operation, particular attention is to be paid to the ſpot where the inciſion is to be made ; the quantity of ſkin and cellular ſubſtance neceſſary to be ſaved, ſo as to cover the muſcles and bone completely, without being ſtretched ; cutting the muſcles in ſuch a manner that they nay unite with each other and entirely cover the end of the bone; the prevention of hemorrhagies during the operation ; the tying of the arteries alone, without including the nerves or any of the contiguous parts ; ſecuring the integuments ſo as to prevent them from retracting after the operation ; and a proper ſubſequent treatment of the caſe.</p><p>The following are the general ſteps of the operation : The patient being properly placed, with aſſiſtants to attend, and the apparatus in proper order, the flow of the blood to the limb is to be stopped by the tourniquet (fig. 16. ). The first inciſion is to be made through the ſkin and cellular subſtance by one, or rather by two, ſtrokes of the amputating knife repreſented in fig. 116. Theſe are next to be separated from the muſcles, as far as may appear ſufficient for covering the ſtump. The ſeparated ſkin or flap ſhould be ſtrongly drawn up, or what perhaps anſwers better, turned up all round the limb, leaving this part of the muscles quite bare. The flap is to be kept in this ſituation by an asſiſtant, while the operator makes the next inciſion at tlhe edge of the reflected ſkin, and cuts till he comes to the bone. This inciſion ſhould be begun on the lower side of the limb, that the blood may not prevent the eye from readily following the edge of the knife during the whole cut. The muſeles are now to be separated from the bone as high as may enable them afterwards completely to cover it. The soft parts in general are then to be drawn up by retractors, which may be either of leather, as in fig. 117. or metal, as in fig 118 a and <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> The perioſteum is to be divided at the place where the saw is to be applied ; but no part of the bone is to be denuded of this membrane, which is afterwards to cover the ſtump, otherwiſe trubleſome exfoliations may enſue. At this place the ſaw (fig. 119. ) is to be applied, and the bone divided with long ſteady ſtrokes. In this part of the operation a good deal depends upon the steadiness of the aſſiſtant who holds the limb ; for if it be held too high, the motion of the ſaw will be impeded ; while the bone may be ſplintered if it be not ſufficiently raised. Any points or ſplinters which may be left ſhould be immediately removed with the pincers (fig. 120.). The retractors are now to be laid aſide, and the principal arteries ſeparated from the nerves, and ſecured by the tenaculum (fig. 17.), or forceps (fig. 120. a), and ligatures.</p><p>The tourniquet ſhould next be a little ſlackened, to allow the different branches to be diſcovered : The clotted blood is to be cleared away with a warm sponge. The patient ſhould get ſome warm cordial drink, and all the arterial branches which can be diſcovered ought to be taken up. The ends of the ligatures are then to be cut of ſuch a length as to allow them to hang without the lips of the wound. The muſcles and ſkin are now to be drawn down, and brought<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0187.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0181"/>

The parts are next to be ſecured by proper bandaging ; and if the operation has been properly performed, the cure wll commonly be made by the firſt intention, and may be completed in the courſe of three or four weeks, and ſometimes in a ſhorter period. This however muſt depend much upon the conſtitution of the patient, as well as the manner of performing the operation.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Of Amputating the Arm and Fore-arm.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Amputation</hi> of the arm is performed according to the rules already laid down. No more of it ſhould be removed than is diſeaſed ; for the longer the ſtump is, the more uſeful it proves. The tourniquet is to be applied a little above the part where the operation is to be performed : As much of the integuments ſhould be saved as may be perfectly ſufficient for covering the sore. In taking up the artery, after the bone has been divided, the operator ought to be attention ot to include the radial nerve, which may be readily diſccovered and ſeparated, as it lies cloſe upon the fore part of the artery. The fore-arm is to be amputated nearly in the ſame manner as the leg ; only that the ſtump may be covered by amputating with the double incision, without tlne aſſiſtance of a flap, which it is neceſſary to form in the leg.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Of Amputating the Thigh.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> performing this operation, the patient ought to be placed upon a table of ordinary height, with the diſeaſed limb supported and ſecured by an aſſiſtant ſeated before him, while other aſſistants take care of the other leg and the arms. The courſe of the blood is to be stopped by applying the tourniquet over the trunk of the femoral artery, near the upper part of the thigh. No more of the thigh ouglnt to be removed than is rendered neceſſary by the diſeaſe, as the more of it is left, the more uſeful it will be to the pattient. An aſſiſtant ſhould graſp the limb with both hands a little above the place where the ſkin is to be divided, and draw it up as far as poſſible ; while the operator, ſtanding on the outſide of the limb, makes a circular inciſion down to the muſcles by one or two ſtrokes of the knife. As much of the integuments is then to be dissected with a ſcalpel from the muſcles as may cover the stump completely ; and this part of the ſkin may either be turned back, or drawn tightly up by an aſſiſtant. The muſcles may then be divided quite acroſs to the bone by the edge of the ſkin, in the common way, or cut obliquely upwards, according to the method of Allanſon, ſo as to lay the bone bare two or three fingers-breadth higher than is done in the common way. The muſcles are next to be ſeparated from the bone with a ſcalpel a little way, that a sufficient quantity may be left for covering the end of it. The rest of the operation is to be performed exactly according to the general rules laid down in the firſt ſection of this chapter. The muſcles and integuments are to be drawn over the end of the bone, and applied closely together, that the ſkin may completely cover the ſtump, and retained in this ſituation by an aſſiſtant till a flannel or cotton roller, according to the ſeason of the year, which has been previouſly fixed round the body, be applied in ſuch a manner as to ſupport and fix them. For which purpoſe it ſhould be passed two or three times, in a circular direction, round the top of the thigh, and ſhould afterwards, with ſpiral turns, be brought down near to the end of the ſtump and faſtened with pins ; and it ſhould not be tighter than may be sufficient to aſſiſt the plasters in preventing retraction.</p><p>The ends of the divided muſcles are now to be laid exactly over the bone; and the edges of the ſkin are to be brought into contact, either ſo as to form a ſtraight longitudinal line, according to the method of Mr B. Bell, &amp;c. ; or they are to be placed horizontally, “that the wound may appear only in a line with the angles at each side,” as adviſed by Allanſon. The ligatures may either hang over the edges of the wound, or be brought to the angles. After the edges of the ſkin are in this manner exactly applied to each other, either a few slips of adhesive plaſter are to be laid acroſs the face of the stump, or two large pieces of adhesive plaſter, with ſeveral pieces of tape fixed to them, are to be applied to the ſurface of the ſkin. The tapes are then to be tied with a running knot immediately over the wound ; by which the parts will be kept ſo cloſely together as to prevent any collection of matter from being formed. The whole ſurface of the stump ſhould next be covered with a large pledget ſpread with an emollient ointment, over which a compreſs of fine tow is to be put, and retained in its place by a broad croſs ſtrap of old linen, paſſing ſome way up the thigh, ſo as to be ſecured by the roller, which is now to be paſſed two or three times round the ſtump ; and the preſſure formed by the croſs ſtrap may afterwards be increased or diminiſhed at pleaſure, by drawing it with more or leſs tightneſs, and fixing it with pins to the roller. While the ſtump is dreſſing, the tourniquet is removed, but replaced again loosely to enable the attendants to check any hemorrhagy which may afterwards enſue.</p><p>The patient is now to be laid to rest, and the limb is to be placed upon a little tow covered with linen, or upon a thin soft pillow ; and to prevent the patient from involuntarily moving the limb, and to guard againft ſpaſmodic ſtartings, which frequently happen after this operation, it may be fixed to the bed by two ſtraps. A baſket or hooped frame ought to be placed over the stump to protect it from the bed-clothes. The patient ſhould immediately get an anodyne draught, which will generally procure ease through the reſt of the day. For this purpoſe, no more light ſhould be let into the room than is merely neceſſary for allowing the attendants to pay attention to the stump. As hemorrhagies ſometimes appear ſeveral hours after the operation, the person who takes the charge of the patient ſhould watch this circumstance with the greateſt attention. If there be only a slight oozing of blood, there is no occaſion for being alarmed ; but whenever it appears to proceed from a large artery, it must be ſecured. The spaſmodic affections which frequently occur after amputation are ſeldom troubleſome, unleſs ſome nerve has been included in ſecuring the arteries ; but when they do appear, laying the limb in the eaſieſt poſture, and giving opiates, are the principal means of procuring relief.</p><p>To prevent inflammation as much as poſſible, the patient is to be kept upon a ſtrict antiphlogiſtic regimen, and his bowels kept open by laxative clyſters, till the inflammatory ſtage is over, which will generally be in a few days. If, notwithstanding this treatment, the stump ſwells, and the patient complain of pain and tightneſs, we ought to endeavour to diſcover from what cauſe the uneaſineſs originates. If it be owing to the straps being too tightly fixed, they muſt be ſlackened. If the ſtump be found much ſwelled, a ſaturnine solution ſhould be applied by means of ſeveral folds of linen ; and if the patient be young and plethoric, he ought to lose a few ounces of blood from the arm ; but if he is weak and emaciated, a different mode of treatment muſt be followed.</p><p>At the end of the third, or fourth day at fartheſt, the ſtump ſhould be examined ; and if it appear ſomewhat open and flaccid, the parts muſt be brought cloſer together and ſecured more firmly. After this time the dreſſings ſhould be renewed every day, or every second day. In about a<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0188.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0182"/>

The roller ſhould be cleaned and renewed as often as it is found ſullied ; nor ſhould it be laid entirely aſide till the end of the third or fourth week after the operation, When the roller is removed, we may depend upon the straps or tapes for keeping the parts together till the cure be quite accompliſhed. When the inflammatory ſymptoms are entirely gone, no medicines ought to be given which would debilitate the patient, nor is any thing more necessary than to keep the bowels gently open till a complete cure be made.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV. <hi rend="italic">Of Amputating the Leg.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> leg may be amputated for a diſeaſe in the foot at two different parts ; the one a hand-breadth under the knee, the other a little above the ankle. The former makes a sufficient ſupport for the body to reſt upon an artificial leg ; but the latter does that equally well, and likewiſe preſerves the motions of the knee.</p><p>In performing the operation a little way under the knee, the patient is to be placed and ſecured in the same manner as in operating upon the thigh. The tourniquet is to be placed a little above the knee, with the cuſhion upon the artery in the ham. The ſurgeon places himſelf upon the inside of the leg, and makes a circular inciſion through the integuments down to the muſcles. The place where the inciſion ſhould be made muſt depend upon the length of the limb ; but in general it may be between six and ſeven inches under the top of the tibia in an adult, or far enough down upon the limb to save as much integuments as will cover the ſtump. After the integuments are cut through in the manner already directed, as much of the muſcles are to be divided by the knife as can be done by a circular inciſion ; and the interosseous parts are to be divided by a ſcalpel or catline, (fig. 121.). The retractors are then to be applied, and the bone ſawed off immediately below the inſertion of the tendons of the flexor muſcles. In ſawing, the operator ought to begin upon both bones at the same time, that he may finiſh upon the tibia, lest ſplinters ſhould be formed. The veſſels are next to be ſecured ; the ſoft parts drawn over the bones ; the adhesive plaſters and other bandages applied in the ſame manner as directed for amputating the thigh, only that here the roller need not be applied ſo high as in the former operation. Two or three turns above the knee, however, are necessary to prevent the dreſſings from slipping down.</p><p>In amputating upon the ankle, the operator ſhould fix upon that ſpot which will leave the ſtump of ſuch a length as may be moſt convenient for being fitted with an artificial machine reſembling the other leg. Nine inches from the joint of the knee, in a leg of ordinary length, was found by Mr Wilſon, a late ingenious artificial limb-maker in Edinburgh, to be the beſt part ſuited to this purpoſe, on account of the equal pressure it makes upon the ſurface of the leg, without making any upon the end of the tender ſtump. The operation is performed in the same manner as that a little below the knee.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V. <hi rend="italic">Of Amputating at the Joints of the Extremities.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> circumſtances moſt to be attended to in performing amputation at the joints are, firſt to ſtop the circulation by the tourniquet ; or, where that is impracticable, to take up the trunk of the artery by a ligature ; to make a circular inciſion in ſuch a place as may, after the operation is over, be sufficient to cover the wound ; Then a longitudinal inciſion is to be made upon the oppoſite ſides of the limb, extending from the joint to the circular cut, and as deep as the bone, by which two flaps will be formed to cover that part of the joint which remains after the operation is finiſhed. The ligaments of the joint are next to be divided, and the affected limb or part of the limb removed.</p><p>After this part of the operation, it was formerly a frequent practice to ſcrape off the remaining cartilage, to unite the parts more firmly together. But this is now ſound to be unnecessary ; for when the fleſh is applied properly to the bone, if it do not grow to it, the union at leaſt is ſo cloſe that it afterwards gives no inconvenience to the patient.</p><p>Any branches of arteries which may have been cut during the operation are now to be ſecured ; clotted blood is to be removed ; and the muſcles and ſkin are to be brought into cloſe contact with the ends of the ligatures hanging out of the wound. The parts are to be retained by adhesive plaſters, or twiſted future, or both ; and proper bandages applied in ſuch a way that a cure may be made by the firſt intention.</p><p>Amputating the arm at the ſhoulder-joint has always been conſidered as a dangerous as well as a difficult operation. It ſhould never be attempted, when the same purpoſe can be accompliſhed by operating lower down. But caſes occaſionally occur, where the life of the patient cannot, in any other manner, be saved.</p><p>Amputation may become neceſſary here in conſequence of abſceſſes of the joint ; caries of the hurnerus reaching to the joint; compound fractures, eſpecially thoſe from gun- ſhot wounds, extending to the head of the bone ; and of mortification.</p><p>In performing the operation, the patient ſhould be laid upon a table of convenient height, covered with a mattreſs. He is then to be brought as near to the edge of it as possible, and ſecured by aſſiſtants. The circulation of the blood in the arm is next to be stopped, by an aſſiſtant preſſing strongly with a firm compreſs over the ſubclavian artery where it paſſes over the firſt rib ; or an inciſion may be made along the courſe of the artery, which may be ſecured after ſeparating from it the contiguous nerves. When the artery is compreſſed, it will readily be known whether the compression proves effectual, by obſerving when the pulse at the wriſt is entirely stopped. As ſoon as this is the caſe, a circular inciſion is to be made through the integuments at the inſertion of the deltoid muſcle into the humerus. An assistant then draws the skin a little back, and at the edge of the retracted ſkin, the muſcles are to be cut in a circular direction to the bone.</p><p>If the artery has not been taken up at the beginning of the operation, it is now to be ſecured, as well as any branches which come in the way.</p><p>The amputation-kniſe is now to be laid aſide, and the reſt of the operation finiſhed with a ſtrong ſcalpel. A perpendicular inciſion is next to be made at a little diſtance from the outſide of the artery, beginning at the acromion, and terminating in the circular inciſion, cutting as deep as the ſurface of the bone. A ſimilar inciſion is to be made upon the back part of the arm, ſo that the flaps may be nearly of an equal breadth. The arterial branches are here to be ſecured ; the flaps are to be ſeparated from the bone, guarding againſt wounding the trunk of the artery ; the flaps are to be ſupported by an aſſiſtant ; and the capſular ligament of the joint is to be cut from the ſcapula : and thus the arm will be entirely ſeparated.</p><p>After the arm has been ſeparated, any arteries which appear about the joint are to be tied, and all the ligatures brought over the edges of the wound. The parts are to be cleared of clotted blood, and the two flaps drawn over the ‘<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0189.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0183"/>

A pledget of any emollient ſhould then be applied, and a sufficient cuſhion of lint, with a compreſs of old linen, put over the whole. A moderate preſſure is next to be applied by a flannel roller ; by which the parts will be ſupported, their union facilitated, and matter moſt likely prevented from being lodged. The treatment is then the same with that after amputation in other parts of the extremities. For two or three days after the operation, it is neceſſary that an aſſiſtant sit with the patient to compreſs the artery in caſe a bleeding ſhould ensue.</p><p>When it is neceſſary to amputate the whole hand, the operation may be performed at the wriſt, ſo as to leave as much of the member as poſſible ; and the ſame rules hold here as in amputating at any of the rest of the joints. The tourniquet is to be applied to the artery in the arm, and the cure is to be completed by the firſt intention. When any of the carpal bones are affected, the ſore will not heal till they either work out by ſuppuration, or are cut out by the knife. When the middle of any of the metacarpal bones is diſeaſed, while their extremities are found, the trepan may be applied, and the diſeaſed parts removed, while the remaining sound parts are preſerved. But if the whole bodies of one or two of theſe bones be affected, while the rest remain sound, all the affected bones ought to be removed. In performing the operation, an inciſion is to be made along the courte of the part affected ; and if the operator have it in his choice, the inciſion ſhould be made upon the back part, ſo as to ſave the great vessels and nerves ſituated in the palm. The integuments are then to be diſſected, and turned to each side ; after which the diſeaſed bones or parts of bones are to be removed, guarding as much as poſſible againſt wounding the principal arteries or nerves which lie near them</p><p>The diſeaſed parts are next to be ſeparated ; any arteries which happen to be cut are to be ſecured ; and, on account of the free communication which they have with neighbouring branches, they ought to be tied at both cut ends. If after this a bleeding ſtill continue, compreſs, ſtyptics, and other remedies proper for stopping blood, are immediately to be uſed. The ſides of the wound are to be brought together, and an attempt made to cure them by the firſt intention.</p><p>In amputating the fingers, it was formerly the practice to operate upon the bodies of the bones in the ſame manner as in the larger extremities ; but at preſent the removal at the joints is more frequently practiſed.</p><p>In performing the operation, it is necessary to ſave as much skin as may cover the stump, and this ought to be done upon the side next the palm, ſo as to guard againſt the effects of friction. The general ſteps of the operation are the ſame with thoſe for amputation of the larger joints.</p><p>A circular inciſion is to be made on the finger by a crooked biſtoury, about the middle of the phalanx, and it may be carried at once to the bone. Another inciſion is to be made with a common ſcalpel at each side of the finger, beginning at the circular one and continuing it to the joint, by which two flaps will be left to cover the stump. The ligaments of the joint are now to be divided, and the bone removed. The blood-vessels are to be ſecured by ligature, and the flaps exactly applied to each other; but in order to protect the end of the bone completely, a ſmall portion may be cut from the uppermoſt flap. The flaps are to be retained by adheſive plaſter, or by the twiſted future ; but if the latter be uſed, the tendons ought to be avoided. Over the ſore an emollient pledget is to be applied, and then a compreſs and roller. If the diſeaſe be ſo ſituated, that inſtead of amputating at the cavity of the joint, the ſurgeon ſhall think proper to operate upon the body of the bone, flaps are to be formed as above, and the bone is to be divided by means of a ſmall ſpring ſaw, fig. 122.</p><p>The amputation of the thigh, at the hip joint, has always been conſidered as one of the moſt formidable operations in surgery ; ſo much so, that very few caſes appear on record of its having ever been put in practice. In the Medical Commentaries of Edinburgh, an inſtance is recorded where the thigh was amputated at this joint, and where the patient ſurvived the operation 18 days, and then died from a different cauſe, when all riſk of hæmorrhagy was over, and when the sore had even a favourable appearance, which ſhows at leaſt that the operation has been done with ſafety. It certainly ought never to be done, however, unleſs as the laſt resource, and when the life of the patient is in absolute danger ; and then only when as much ſkin and muſcles can be ſaved as will cover the ſore, and when there is alſo a probability of being able to ſtop the hemorrhagy, and prevent it from returning.</p><p>When the operation is to be performed, the patient is to be laid upon his back on a table, and properly ſecured by aſſiſtants; one of whom ſhould be ready with a firm cuſhion to preſs, if neceſſary, upon the top of the femoral artery, juſt after it paſſes from behind Poupart’s ligament to the thigh. A longitudinal inciſion is now to be made through the ſkin, beginning immediately under the ligament, and continuing it downwards along the courſe of the artery for about six or ſeven inches. The aponeuroſis of the thigh is then to be divided by gentle ſcratches till a furrowed probe can be introduced, when the opening is to be dilated by means of a ſcalpel, till two or three inches of the artery be laid bare. A ſtrong ligature is now to be put under the artery by the aſſiſtance of a curved blunt-pointed needle.</p><p>The part where the ligature ſhould be passed is immediately above the origin of the arteria profunda ; for if that artery be not affected by the ligature, the patient might ſuffer by the loss of blood during the rest of the operation. The ligature is now to be ſecured by a running-knot ; Another ligature is to be introduced a little below the former, and likewiſe ſecured ; the artery is then to be divided between the ligatures. A circular inciſion is now to be made through the integuments of the thigh, about six inches from its upper end. The retracted ſkin is then to be pulled at leaſt an inch upwards ; and at the edges of it the amputating knife is to be applied, ſo as to cut the muſcles down to the bone. This being done, a cut is to be made upon the poſterior part of the thigh, beginning a little higher than the great trochanter, and continuing it down to the circular inciſion, and as deep as the joint. A ſimilar cut is to be made on the anterior part of the thigh, at a ſmall diſtance from the artery, and this reaching likewiſe down to the bone. The two muscular flaps are to be ſeparated from the bone and joint, and held back by an aſſiſtant. Every artery which appears is now to be ſecured. Then the capſular ligament, and next the round one, are to be ſeparated from the acetabulum ; by which means the limb will be removed from the body. The acetabulum and neighbouring bone are next to be examined ; and if they appear found, the caſe will be more favourable ; but at any rate, a cure is to be attempted by the firſt intention. For which purpoſe, after removing all the clotted blood from the ſurface of the wound, and bringing the ligatures over the edges of the ſkin, the muſcles are to be placed as nearly as poſſible in their natural ſituation ; and drawing the flaps together, ſo as to cover the wound in the moſt accurate manner, they are to be kept in this ſituation by adheſive plaſter, and<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0190.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0184"/>
                                                                                                                                            by the twiſted future and other dreſſings, as in amputating at the under part of the thigh. The dreſſings are to be regained by a broad flannel roller paſſed three or four times round the body, and ſpirally over the ſtump, and ſecured. The patient is then to be laid in bed on the sound side, and treated as for amputation in other parts of the body ; only that greater attention is neceſſary, as there is no aſſiſtance from a tourniquet. Uncommon attention will alſo be neceſſary to prevent inflammation, and every ſymptom of fever which may ſucceed to the operation.</p><p>When the foot is ſo much diſeaſed as to require amputation, the operation might be performed at the point of the ankle ; but for the reasons given, when treating of amputation of the leg, it is found better to do it above the ankle. When a conſiderable part remains found, it ought to be ſaved. If any or the tarſal bones are affected, theſe are to be removed. When the middle or whole body of any of the metatarſal bones are diſeaſed, they are to be removed in the same manner as directed for ſimilar operations in bones of the hand ; and if even two of them remain found, provided they be ſo placed as to ſupport the toes, they ought to be preſerved, as it is known that, by proper treatment, an oſſeous matter may afterwards fill a conſiderable part, if not the whole, of the void ; or if any cavity remain, it may be ſo stuffed that the uſe of the foot may ſtill be enjoyed.</p><p>In performing an operation of this kind, the patient ſhould be laid upon a table, and the tourniquet applied in the ham to prevent hemorrhagy. An inciſion is then to be made along the affected part ; and if the ſeat of the diſeaſe admit it, the inciſion ſhould be made upon the upper side of the foot ſo as to ſave the ſole. The integuments are to be ſeparated and turned to each side, to allow the affected parts to be completely removed.</p><p>The principal veſſels and nerves are to be ſaved as much as poſſible ; but if any particular artery be cut, it is to be ſecured, and the part treated as after the removal of ſimilar parts of the hand.</p><p>The amputation of the toes is exactly ſimilar to that of the fingers.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V. Of <hi rend="italic">removing the Ends of Carious Bones in the Joints.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> compound fractures, the ends of bones, when they protruded in ſuch a manner that they could not otherwiſe be returned, have frequently been ſawed through ; and their place has frequently been ſupplied by a renewal of bone, ſo as to preſerve the ordinary uſe of the limb. Many caſes have likewiſe happened, where a large part of the body of the bone has been thrown out by ſuppuration, and its place ſupplied ; and a few are upon record, where either the whole of a bone, or that end next the joint, has been thrown out, and its place filled up with callus, ſo that no inconvenience has been felt. From theſe circumſtances, Mr White of Mancheſter was led to preſerve an arm by sawing off the head of a diſeaſed humerus ; and Mr Park of Liverpool, to ſave a limb, by ſawing off the ends of the bones, in a cafe or white ſwelling of the knee. When therefore it happens that the end of a bone is diſeaſed, while the other parts are found, the diſeaſed part may be removed, and the found one ſaved, ſo as in a great meaſure to preſerve the free uſe of the limb.</p><p>In performing the operation, the firſt ſtep ſhould be, to uſe such means as may enable the operator to have a full management of the circulation of the part affected. Then a longitudinal inciſion of sufficient length, and perhaps another across it, may be necessary to be made through the ſoft parts of the joint ; and this opening ought to be at a diſtance from the large blood-veſſels, that they may be in no danger of being injured. After the end of the diſeaſed bone is sufficiently laid bare, it is either to be brought out of the joint, or a ſpatula or ſome other proper ſubſtance is to be introduced between the bone and <hi rend="italic">ſoft</hi> parts, ſo as to defend the latter in time of ſawing the bone. After the diſeaſed part of the bone is removed, the arterial branches are to be ſecured, and the wound treated like any other wound of equal ſize.</p><p>During the cure the limb ought to be kept in the poſture moſt favourable for the removal of the bone, and afterwards for the preſervation of the natural motion of the joint.</p><p>In this way a limb may ſometimes be ſaved which would otherwiſe have been removed. But though the removal of the diſeaſed end of one bone may be readily effected, the removal of all that part of the bones which enters into the compoſition of a joint muſt be attended with ſo must inconvenience, that it can ſeldom be uſeful, unleſs it be where the ends of bones are deſtroyed by external violence; for then <hi rend="italic">it</hi> appears that this operation may be performed with conſiderable ſucceſs.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXXV. <hi rend="italic">Of Diminiſhing Pain in Surgical Operations.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> pain induced by ſurgical operations may be lessened in two different ways. The firſt is, by diminiſhing the natural ſenſibility of the ſyſtem ; and for this purpoſe narcotics of different kinds, and particularly opium, have been uſed ; but theſe are apt to induce diſagreeable ſymptoms, eſpecially sickneſs and vomiting, which might be attended with bad conſequences after ſome operations. They are therefore ſeldom employed before an operation. When, however, they are given immediately after it, and repeated as circumſtances may require, they often give great relief.</p><p>The other method of diminishing pain is, by lesſening the ſenſibility of a particular part of the body. It has long been known, that the ſenſibility of any part may not only be lessened, but entirely ſuſpended, by compressing the nerves which ſupply it. From a knowledge of this circumſtance, an inſtrument (fig. 123.) was invented some years ago by Mr James Moore ot London, by which the principal nerves of a member might be ſo compressed as to render the parts below perfectly inſenſible. A difficulty, however, ariſes here ; for as the nerves muſt be compressed at leaſt an hour previous to the operation, in order to render the parts quite inſenſible, and as it is extremely difficult to compreſs the nerves without at the ſame time affecting the veins, the latter are therefore in danger of being burſt. To prevent this inconvenience, Mr Moore propoſes to open a vein ; but this might be attended with bad conſequences in weakly conſtitutions. Beſides, it is ſaid, that by compressing the nerves in this manner, although leſs pain may be felt in the time oſ the operation, it is proportionally greater after the compression is removed. In certain parts of the body, however, where sufficient compreſſion can be made upon the nerves without acting much upon the veins, it would appear that the method may be practiſed with advantage ; though it has not yet been done, excepting in a few inſtances.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXXVI.

                                                                                                                                                moving deformities, and for effecting the union of divided parts. They ought to be formed of ſuch materials as are ſufficiently firm, while, at the ſame time, they give no uneaſineſs to the parts to which they are applied. They may be compoſed either of linen, cotton, or flannel. Of late years the two laſt have been preferred by many for their warmth and elaſticity, on which account they are certainly moſt proper, eſpecially in winter ; and likewiſe in caſes where the parts are liable to ſwelling and inflammation, as in wounds, luxations, and fractures. Besides, they more readily, abſorb any moiſture which may be diſcharged from the sores.</p><p>When firſt applied, they ſhould be clean, ſufficiently ſtrong, and as free of ſeams as poſſible. They ſhould be ſo tightly applied as to anſwer the purpoſe for which they are intended, without being in danger of impeding the circulation. They ſhould be applied in ſuch a manner that they may be eaſily looſened, and the parts examined with as much accuracy as poſſible ; and they ſhould be laid aſide as ſoon as the purpoſe for which they are intended is accompliſhed ; for when longer continued, they frequently impede the growth of the parts upon which they are applied.</p><p>With reſpect to bandages for particular parts, we ſhall begin with the head, and then proceed to the trunk and extremities. The <hi rend="italic">couvre-chef</hi> of the French, which is a ſquare napkin folded cornerwiſe, is moſt frequently uſed where a bandage is wanted for the head ; but a nightcap, having a band to go round the head, and another to tie under the chin, appears to be more ſuitable for this purpoſe. For making compreſſion on any particular part of the head, as for flopping of bleeding veſſels, the radiated bandage may be employed.</p><p>For keeping the edges of wounds together, as in caſes of longitudinal cuts of the head, or of any other parts, the uniting bandage is uſually employed, and is always to be preferred to futures, where it retains the edges of the wound with sufficient exactneſs. For retaining dreſſings upon the eyes, ſeveral turns of a roller have been uſed, and it is termed <hi rend="italic">monoculus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">binoculus</hi> according to its being applied to one or both eyes ; but the <hi rend="italic">couvre chef,</hi> and the nightcap already mentioned, are leſs apt to slip, and therefore found more convenient for this purpoſe.</p><p>For fractures of the noſe, or wounds there, or on any other part of the face, the uniting bandage anſwers beſt. And in caſes of fracture of the lower jaw, a four-headed roller is moſt convenient : the hole in the centre of the roller receives the chin, and aſſiſts in preventing the bandage from ſhifting. The two upper heads are to be carried backwards ; and being made to paſs each other at the occiput, they are afterwards brought once or twice round the head. The two under heads of the roller being reflected over the chin, are then to be turned upwards and fixed on the upper part of the head.</p><p>The bandages neceſſary for the neck are, the machine already mentioned after the operation of bronchotomy, and one uſed in caſes of wry neck. For every other purpoſe of bandaging a common roller may anſwer perfectly well.</p><p>For fractures of the ſcapula the application of a long roller may be of ſervice.</p><p>For retaining dreſſings upon the thorax the napkin and scapulary are commonly, and very properly uſed ; and when the napkin is employed merely for retaining dreſſings, it need not be longer than to paſs once round the body ; but if it be uſed for making pressure over a fractured rib, it ought to pass two or three times round. For both purpoſes its breadth ought to be six or ſeven inches for an adult.</p><p>The ſame kind of bandages is alſo uſed for making preſſure on the abdomen, as in caſes of umbilical or ventral hernia ; and to keep the bandage properly placed, a ſcapulary is uſed for preventing it from slipping down, and one or two ſtraps connected with it behind, are brought between the thighs, and fixed to it before to prevent it from moving up. A bandage of flannel, and different kinds of belts, are contrived for compreſſing the abdomen in the operation of tap. ping ; and trusses of various conſtructions are uſed for the retention of the protruded bowels in caſes of hernia.</p><p>Bandages of cotton or flannel are uſed for ſupporting the ſcrotum in the various diſeaſes which may occur there, as well as after the operations performed upon it.</p><p>One of the beſt bandages for the penis is a linen or cotton bag, fixed by a roller round the body.</p><p>For retaining dreſſings about the anus, or between that part and the ſcrotum, the T bandage is commonly uſed ; and it is made either with one or two tails, according to the ſituation of the part to which it is to be applied.</p><p>In ſimple fractures, and moſt of the other diſeaſes of the arm, fore-arm, and hand, the roller is the bandage commonly uſed ; but in compound fractures of theſe parts, as well as in the different kinds of fractures of the lower extremities, the 12 or 18 tailed bandage is necessary.</p><p>For longitudinal wounds of the extremities, the uniting bandage is uſed with the ſame advantage as has been already mentioned for wounds of a ſimilar nature upon the head.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXXVII. <hi rend="italic">The Method of opening a dead Body.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Surgeons</hi> are often called, in order to inveſtigate the cauſe and feat of diſeaſes and death, either by the relations of the deceaſed, or the magistrates to whom a repent is to be made ; therefore, at the time of performing this operation, minutes ſhould be taken of what is obſerved. The inſtruments, and all things necessary, ſhould be diſpoſed in order, as for any other operation ; as knives, a razor, a great and ſmall ſaw, ſciſſars ſtraight and curved, elevators, needles threaded, ſponges, tow, ſaw-duſt or bran, baſons with water, towels, and receivers for the viſcera when they are to be taken out of their cavities The body is to be laid upon a ſuitable table, advantageously placed for the light, having a cloth thrown over the parts which decency demands ſhould be concealed, eſpecially in females.</p><p>When it is intended only to inſpect the abdomen and its contents, a longitudinal inciſion from the xiphoid cartilage to the os pubis, interſected by a tranſverſe one at the navel, will give a fair opportunity of anſwering theſe purpoſes, when the angles are reverſed. Should it be required to examine all the three cavities, and the parts contained in them, we are to begin by opening the head, making an inciſion quite croſs to the bone, from ear to ear ; which ſection is preferable to the crucial, commonly made on this occaſion : then the ſcalp may be eaſily dissected from the ſkull, and turned down over the face, and towards the neck, giving room for the ſaw. The head muſt be held very ſteadily by an aſſiſtant during the ſawing, which ſhould be begun on the middle of the frontal, proceeding to each temporal bone, and ſo to finiſh the circle upon the middle of the occipital bone ; which may generally be done conveniently enough, by raiſing the head and inclining it forward after having proceeded as far as this bone ; or the body may then be turned prone, ſhould that poſture be found more convenient to complete the circle. The cap of the ſkull is then to be raised with the elevator, occaſionally cutting the adheſions of the dura mater ; after this the encephalon is to be removed, carefully ſeparating the other attachments of the membrane.</p><p>In order to bring the thorax and abdomen, with the parts<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0192.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0186"/>

Large and deep inciſions are alſo to be made in all the moſt fleſhy parts, cleaning and waſhing them with the tincture in the ſame manner, filling them with the antiſeptic ſpices, and ſtitching them up.

After the application of the cerecloth, with great care and exactness, cut into ſuitable pieces according to the reſpective parts, and cloſing them well everywhere, the face being cloſe ſhaved, is to be covered with ſome of the above compoſition melted, and laid on with a bruſh of a proper degree of heat, and of a moderate thickneſs ; which may have a faint fleſh- colour given it with vermilion ; and when it is grown cold and stiff upon this part, it may be lightly covered with hard varniſh ; or this varniſh, applied thick, may here ſerve the purpoſe alone.
