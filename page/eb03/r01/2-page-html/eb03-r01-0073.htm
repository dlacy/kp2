<p><span class="font1">r¢Ugieue djtT¢r¢nces, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ι» To </span><span class="font1">grant the Proteſtants a toleration and privilege of ſerving God as they thought&nbsp;propers 2. To compel them to return to the church&nbsp;of Rome by the violent methods of perſecution : or,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a. </span><span class="font1">That a reconciliation ſhould be made, upon fair, can-did, and equitable terms, by engaging each of the par-ties to temper their zeal with moderation, to abate re-¢iprocaliy the rigour of their pretenſions, and remit&nbsp;fomething of their reſpective claims. The third expedient was moſt generally approved of, being peculiarly&nbsp;agreeable to all who had at heart the welfare of the&nbsp;empire ; nor did the pope ſeem to look upon it either&nbsp;with averfion or contempt. Various conferences therefore were he’d between perſons eminent for piety and&nbsp;learning on both ſides ∙ and nothing was omitted that&nbsp;might have the leaſt tendency to calm the animoſities&nbsp;and heal the diviſions which reigned between the con.&nbsp;tending parties. But the differences were too great to&nbsp;admit of a reconciliation ; and therefore the votaries of&nbsp;Rome had recourſe to the powerful arguments of imperial edicts, and the force of the ſecular arm. Οη the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">i </span><span class="font1">ρth of November, a ſevere decree was iſſued out by&nbsp;the expreſs order of the emperor (during the abſence&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font1"> the Heſſian and Saxon princes, who were the chief&nbsp;ſupporters of the Proteſtant cauſe), in which every thing&nbsp;was manifeſtly adapted to deject the friends of religious&nbsp;liberty, excepting only a faint and dubious promiſe of&nbsp;engaging the pope to aſſemble a general council about&nbsp;fiκ months after the ſeparation oſ the diet. In this de-créé the dignity and excellence of the Popiſh religion&nbsp;were extolled beyond meaſure, a new degree of ſeverity&nbsp;and force was added to that which had been publiſhed at&nbsp;Worms againſt Luther aιjd his adherents, the changes&nbsp;which had been introduced into the doctrine and diſcipline of the Proteſtant churches were ſeverely eenſured,&nbsp;and a ſolemn order was addreſied to the princes,cities, and&nbsp;ſtates, who had thrown off the Papal yoke, to return to&nbsp;their allegiance to Rome, on pain of incurring the indig-nation and vengeance of the emperor as the patron and&nbsp;protector of the church. Of this formidable decree thc&nbsp;ejector of βaxonyand confederated princeswere noſooner&nbsp;informed, than they affembled in order to deliberate on&nbsp;the meaſures proper to be taken in ſuch a criſis. In&nbsp;the years 1530 and 1531 they met, </span><span class="font0">fiiſt </span><span class="font1">at Smalcald,&nbsp;and afterwards at Francfort, where they formed a ſo-lemn alliance and confederacy, with the intention of defending vigorouſly their religion and liberties againſt the&nbsp;dangers and encroachments with which they were threa-tened by the edict of Augſhurg, without attempting,&nbsp;however, any thing· offenſive againſt the votaries of&nbsp;Rome ; and into this confederacy they invited th¢ kings&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">England, France, Denmark, &amp;c. leaving no means&nbsp;unemployed that might corroborate and cement this important alliance,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This confederacy was at firſt oppoſed by Luther, from an apprehenſion of the calamities and troubles&nbsp;which it might produce j but at laſt, perceiving the&nbsp;neceſſity of it, he conſented ; though he uncharitably,&nbsp;as well as imprudently, refuſed to comprehend in it the&nbsp;followers of Zuinglius among thc Swiſs, together with&nbsp;the German ſtates and cities who had adopted the fen-</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">timents </span><span class="font1">and confeſſion of Bucer. In the invitation ad-dreffed </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font1">Henry VIII. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">England, whom the con-federate princes were willing to declare the head and&nbsp;protector of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">their </span><span class="font1">league, the following things, among</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">others, </span><span class="font1">were «tpr¢ſtly ſtipulated : That the king fliauïd encourage, promote, and maintain, the true doctrine of&nbsp;Chriſt as it was contained in the confeſſion of Augf- '&nbsp;burg, and deiend the fame at the next general council :&nbsp;that he ſhould not agree to any council lummoned bv&nbsp;the biſhop of Rome, but proteſt againſt it ; and neither ſubmit to its decrees, nor ſuffer them to be reſpected in his dominions: that he ſhould never allow the&nbsp;Roman pontiſt to have any pre-eminence or juriſdiction&nbsp;in his dominions ; that he ſhould advance 100,000 crowns&nbsp;for the uſe of the confederacy, and double that ſum if&nbsp;it became neceffary : all which articles the confederate&nbsp;pιinces were equally obliged to obſerve on their part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I o theſe demands the king replied, that he would mam-tain and promote the true doctrine of Chriſt ; but, at the fame time, as the true ground of that doctrine lay&nbsp;only in the holy Scriptures, he would not accept at&nbsp;any one’s hand what ſhould he his own faith, or that of&nbsp;his kingdom j and therefore deſired that they would ſend&nbsp;over two learned men to confer with him, in order to&nbsp;promote a religious union between him and the confederates. However, he declared himſelf of their opinion&nbsp;with 1 egard to the meeting of a free general council,&nbsp;and promiſed to join with them in all fuch councils for the&nbsp;defence of the true doctrine ; hut thought the regula-tion of the ceremonial part of religion, being a matter&nbsp;of indifference, ought to be left to the choice of each&nbsp;ſovereign for his own dominions. After this the king&nbsp;gave them a ſecond anſwer more full and fatisfactory ;&nbsp;but afteι the execution oſ queen Anne, this negociatioπ&nbsp;came to nothing. Ο11 the one hand, the king grew&nbsp;cold when he perceived that the confederates were no&nbsp;longer of uſe to him in ſupporting the validity of hi<sub>3&nbsp;</sub>marriage 5 and, on the other hand, the German princes&nbsp;became ſenſible that they could never fucceed with. Henry unleſs they allowed him an abſolute dictatorſhip in&nbsp;matters of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">while every thing thus tended to an open war be-tween the two oppoſite parties, the elector Palatine, and the elector of Mentz, offered their mediation, and en-deavouιed to procure a reconciliation. I he emperor&nbsp;himſelf, for various reaſons, was at this time inclined to&nbsp;peace : for, on the one hand, he ſtood in need of ſuccours againſt the Turks, which the Proteſtant princes&nbsp;refuſed to grant as long as the edicts of worms and&nbsp;Augſhurg remained in force ; and, on the other, the&nbsp;election of his brother Ferdinand to the dignity of king&nbsp;of the Romans, which had been carried by a majority&nbsp;of votes at the diet of Cologne in 1531, was by the&nbsp;fame pιinces conteſted, as being contrary to the fundamental laws of the empire. In conſequence of all this,&nbsp;after many negociations and projects of reconciliation,&nbsp;a treaty of peace was concluded at Nuremberg in 1532,&nbsp;between the emperor and the Proteſtant princes, on the&nbsp;following conditions ; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">viz.</span><span class="font1"> That the latter ſhould furniſh a ſubſidy for carrying on the war againſt the Turks,&nbsp;and acknowledge Ferdinand lawful king of the Romans;&nbsp;and that the emperor on his part ſhould abrogate and&nbsp;annul the edicts of worms and Augſhurg·, and allow the&nbsp;Lutherans the free and undiſturbed exerciſe of their religious doctrine and diſcipline, until a rule of faith was&nbsp;fixed either in the free general council that was to be&nbsp;affembled in the fpace of ſix months, or in a diet of the&nbsp;empire.</span></p>
