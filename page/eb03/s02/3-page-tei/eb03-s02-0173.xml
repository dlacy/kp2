What is ſaid concerning the church of Epheſus, that her “candleſtick ſhall be removed: out of its place,” which is now verified, not only in this, but in all the other Aſiatic churches which exiſted at that time; the light of the goſpel having been taken from them, not only by their hereſies and diviſions from within, but by the arms of the Saracens from without: And, 2. Concerning the church of Smyrna, that ſhe ſhall. “have tribulation ten days;” that is, in prophetic language, “ten years;” referring to the perſecution of Diocleſian, which alone of all the general perſecutions laſted ſo long.</p><p>The next five chapters relate to the opening of the <hi rend="italic">Seven Seals;</hi> and by theſe ſeals are intimated ſo many different periods of the prophecy. Six of theſe ſeals are opened in the ſixth and ſeventh chapters.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">first ſeal</hi> or period is memorable for conqueſts. It commences with Veſpaſian, and terminates in Nerva; and during this time Judea was ſubjugated. The se<hi rend="italic">cond ſeal</hi> is noted for war and ſlaughter. It commences with Trajan, and continues through his reign, and that of his ſucceſſors. In this period, the Jews were entirely routed and diſperſed; and great was the ſlaughter and devaſtation occaſioned by the contending parties. The <hi rend="italic">third ſeal</hi> is characteriſed by a rigorous execution of juſtice, and an abundant proviſion of corn, wine, and oil. It commences with Septimius Severus. He and Alexander Severus were juſt and ſevere emperors, and at the ſame time highly celebrated for the regard they paid to the felicity of their people, by procuring them plenty of every thing, and particularly corn, wine, and oil. This period laſted during the reigns of the Septimian family. The <hi rend="italic">fourth ſeal</hi> is diſtinguiſhed by a concurrence of evils, ſuch as war, famine, peſtilence, and wild beaſts; by all which the Roman empire was remarkably infeſted from the reign of Maximin to that of Diocleſian. The <hi rend="italic">fifth ſeal</hi> begins at Diocleſian, and is ſignalized by the great perſecution, from whence aroſe that memorable era, the Era of Martyrs. With Conſtantine begins the <hi rend="italic">ſixth ſeal,</hi> a period of revolutions, pictured forth by great commotions in earth and in heaven, alluding to the ſubverſion of Paganiſm and the eſtabliſhment of Chriſtianity. This period laſted from the reign of Conſtantine the Great to that of Theodoſius the firſt. The <hi rend="italic">ſeventh ſeal</hi> includes ander it the remaining parts of the prophecy, and comprehends ſeven periods diſtinguiſhed by the founding of ſeven trumpets.</p><p>As the ſeals foretold the ſtate of the Roman empire before and till it became Chriſtian, ſo the trumpets foreſhow the fate of it afterwards; each trumpet being an alarm to one nation or other, rouſing them up to overthrow that empire.</p><p>Four of theſe trumpets are founded in the eighth chapter.</p><p>At the founding of the firſt, Alaric and his G0th3 invade the Roman empire, beſiege Rome twice, and ſet it on fire in ſeveral places. At the founding of the second, Attila and his Huns waſte the Roman provinces, and compel the eaſtern emperor Theodoſius the ſecond, and the weſtern emperor Valentinian the third, to ſubmit to ſhameful terms. At the founding of the third, Genſeric and his Vandals arrive from Africa; ſpoil and plunder Rome, and ſet ſail again with immenſe wealth and innumerable captives. At the founding of the fourth, Odoacer and the Heruli put an end to the very name of the weſtern empire; Theodoric founds the kingdom of the Oſtrogoths in Italy; and at laſt Italy becomes a province of the eaſtern empire, Rome being governed by a duke under the exarch of Ravenna. As the foregoing trumpets relate chiefly to the downfal of the weſtern empire, ſo do the two following to that of the eaſtern. They are founded in the ninth, tenth, and part of the eleventh chapters. At the founding of the fifth trumpet, Mahomet, that blazing ſtar, appears, opens the bottomleſs pit, and with his lecuſts the Arabians darkens the ſun and air. And at the founding of the ſixth, a period not yet finiſhed, the four angels, that is, the four ſultanes, or leaders of the Turks and Othmans, are looſed from the river Euphrates.. The Greek or Eaſtern empire was cruelly "hurt and tormented” under the fifth trumpet; but under the ſixth, it was “ſlain,” and utterly deſtroyed.</p><p>The Latin or Weſtern Church not being reclaimed by the ruin of the Greek or Eaſtern, but ſtill perſiſting in their idolatry and wickedneſs; at the beginning of the tenth chapter, and under the ſound of this ſixth trumpet, is introduced a viſion preparative to the prophecies reſpecting the Weſtern Church, wherein an angel is repreſented, having in his hand a little book, or. codicil, deſcribing the calamities that ſhould overtake that church. The meaſuring of the temple ſhows, that during all this period there will be ſome true Chriſtians, who will conform themſelves to the rule of God’s word, even whilſt the outer court, that is, the external and more extenſive part of this temple or church, is trodden under foot by Gentiles, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> ſuch Chriſtians as, in their idolatrous worſhip and perſecuting practice, reſemble and outdo the Gentiles themſelves. Yet againſt theſe corrupters of religion there will always be ſome true witneffes to proteſt, who, however they may be over- borne at times, and in appearance reduced to death, yet will ariſe again from time to time, till at laſt they triumph and glorioully aſcend. The eleventh chapter concludes with the founding of the ſeventh trumpet.</p><p>@@@(I) Diſſertations on the prophecies which have remarkably been fulfilled, and at this time are fulfilling, in the world, vol. iii. 8vo.</p></body></text></TEI>
