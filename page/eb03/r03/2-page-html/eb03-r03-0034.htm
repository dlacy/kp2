<p><span class="font0">ROTACEÆ (from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rota,</span><span class="font0"> <sup>it</sup>a wheel”), the name of the 20th order in Linnaeus’s Fragments of a Natural&nbsp;Method ; conſiſting of plants with one flat, wheel-ſha-ped petal, without a tube. See Botany, p. 461.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROTALA, in botany ; a genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the triandria claſs of plants. The&nbsp;calyx is tridentate ; there is no corolla ; the capſule is&nbsp;trilocular and polyſpermous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROTANG. See Calamus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROTA ΓΙΟΝ, is a term which expreſſes the motion of the different parts of a ſolid body round an axis, and&nbsp;diſtinct from the progreſſive motion which ſt may&nbsp;. have in its revolution round a diſtant point. The earth&nbsp;has a rotation round its axis, which produces the viciſ-ſitudes of day and night ; while its revolution round the&nbsp;ſun, combined with the obliquity oſ the equator, pro</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">duces the varieties ©f ſummer and winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The mechaniſm of this kind of motion, or the relation which ſubſiſts between the intenſity of the moving forces, modified as it may be by the manner oſ application, and the velocity of rotation, is highly intereſting,&nbsp;both to the ſpeculative philoſopher and to the practical&nbsp;engineer. The preceſſion of the equinoxes, and many&nbsp;other aſtronomical problems of great importance and&nbsp;difficulty, receive their ſolutions from this quarter : and&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aBual performance</span><span class="font0"> of our moſt valuable machines&nbsp;cannot be aſcertained by the mere principles of equilibrium, but require a previous acquaintance with certain general propoſitions of rotatory motion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is chiefly with the view of aſſiſting the engineer that we propoſe to deliver in this place a few fundamental propoſitions ; and we ſhall do it in as familiar&nbsp;and popular a manner as poſſible, although this may&nbsp;cauſe the application of them to the abſtruſe problems&nbsp;of aſtronomy to be greatly deficient in the elegance of&nbsp;which they are ſuſceptible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When a ſolid body turns round an axis, retaining its ſhape and dimenſions, every particle is actually deſcri-j bing a circle round this axis, and the axis paſſes through&nbsp;the centre of the circle, and is perpendicular to its&nbsp;plane. Moreover, in any inſtant of the motion, the&nbsp;particle is moving at right angles with the radius vector,&nbsp;or line joining it with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">its</span><span class="font0"> centre of rotation. Therefore^&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">in </span><span class="font0">order to aſcertain the direction of the motion of any&nbsp;particle P (fig. r.), we may draw a ſtraight line PC&nbsp;• from the particle perpendicular to the axis AB of rotation. This line will lie in the plane of the circle </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pmη&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font0"> rotation of the particle, and will be its radius vector ;&nbsp;and a line PQ_drawn from the particle perpendicular to&nbsp;this radius vector will be a tangent to the circle of rotation, and wilΓhave the direction of the motion of this</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">particle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The whole body being ſuppoſed to turn together, it is evident, that when it has made a complete rotation, ,&nbsp;each particle has deſcribed a circumference of a circle,&nbsp;and the whole paths of the different particles will be in&nbsp;the ratio oſ theſe circumferences, and therefore of their&nbsp;radii ; and this is true of any portion of a whole turn,&nbsp;ſuch as 4» ⅛, or 20 degrees, or any arch whatever;&nbsp;therefore the velocities of the different particles are proportional to their radii </span><span class="font1">vectores, or to their diſtances&nbsp;from the </span><span class="font0">axis </span><span class="font1">oſ rotation. ..</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And, laſtly, aï! theſe motions are in parallel plane?, to which the axis of rotation is perpendicular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When we compare the rotations of different bodies in reſpect of velocity, it is plain that it cannot be done<sub>t&nbsp;</sub>by directly comparing the velocity of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">any</span><span class="font0"> particle in &lt;&nbsp;one of the bodies with that of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">any</span><span class="font0"> particle of the other;<sup>t&nbsp;</sup>ſor, as all the particles of each have different velocities, <sub>1&nbsp;</sub>this compariſon can eſtabliſh no ratio. But we fami-1&nbsp;liarly compare ſuch motions by the number of complete &lt;&nbsp;turns which they make in equal times, and we ſay that&nbsp;the ſecond hand of a dock turns 6o times faſter than&nbsp;the minute hand ; now' this compariſon i⅛, equally juſt&nbsp;in any part of a turn as in the whole. While the minute-hand moves round one degree, the ſecond-hand&nbsp;moves 60 ; therefore, as the length or number of feet&nbsp;in the line uniformly deſcribed by a body in its progreſſive motion is a proper meaſure of its progreſſive velocity, ſo the number of degrees deſcribed by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">any</span><span class="font0"> particle&nbsp;of a whirling body in the circumference of its circle of&nbsp;rotation, or the angle deſcribed by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">any</span><span class="font0"> radius vector of&nbsp;that bodv, is a proper meaſure of its velocity off rotation. And in this manner may the rotation of two&nbsp;bodies be compared; and the velocity is with propriety&nbsp;termed angular, velocity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An angle is directly as the length of the circumference on which it ſtands, and inverſely as the radius of the circle, and may be expreffed by the fraction of&nbsp;which the numerator is the arch, and the denominator&nbsp;the radius. Thus the angle PC/ may be expreffed by&nbsp;P A</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This fraction expreſſes the portion of the radius</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">which is equal to the arch which meaſures the angle ; and it is converted into the uſual denomination of degrees, by knowing that one degree, or the 360th part</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of the circumference, is ---of the radius, or that</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">57,296</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">an arch of 57,206 degrees is equal to the radius;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When a ſolid body receives an impulſe on any one 1 point, or when that point is anyhow urged by a moving<sup>!&nbsp;</sup>force, it cannot move without the other points alſo moving. And whatever is the motion of any particle, thati&nbsp;particle muſt be conceived as urged by a force preciſely&nbsp;competent to the production of that motion, by acting'&nbsp;immediately on the particle itſelf. If this is not the&nbsp;particle immediately acted on by the external foιce, the&nbsp;force wſhich really impels it is a force ariſing from the&nbsp;coheſion of the body. The particle immediately impelled by the external force is preſſed towards its neighbouring particles, or is drawn away from them ; and,&nbsp;by this change of place, the connecting forces are&nbsp;brought into action, or are excited ; they act on the&nbsp;particles adj lining, and change, or tend to change,&nbsp;their diſtances from the particles immediately beyond&nbsp;them ; and thus the forces which connect this next ſe-ries of particles are alſo excited, and another ſeries of&nbsp;particles are made to exert their forces ; and this goes&nbsp;on through the body till we come to the remote particle, whoſe motion we are conſidering. The forces&nbsp;which connect it with the adjoining ſeries of particles&nbsp;are excited, and the particle is moved. We frequently&nbsp;ſay that the external moving force is propagated thro<sup>,&nbsp;</sup>the body to the diſtant particle ; but this is not accurate. The particle is really and immediately moved </span><span class="font1">by&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the forces which connect it with thoſe adjoining.
