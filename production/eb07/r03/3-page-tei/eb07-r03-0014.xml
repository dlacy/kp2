A queen dowager is the widow of the king, and as such enjoys most of the privileges belonging to her as queen consort. But it is not high treason to conspire her death, or to violate her chastity; because the succession to the crown is not thereby endangered. Yet still, <hi rend="italic">pro dignitate regali,</hi>  no man can marry a queen dowager without special license from the king, on pain of forfeiting his lands and goods.</p><p>2.    The Prince of Wales, or heir apparent to the crown, and also his royal consort, and the princess royal or eldest daughter of the king, are likewise peculiarly regarded by the laws. For, by statute 25 Edw. III. to compass or conspire the death of the former, or to violate the chastity of either of the latter, is as much high treason as to conspire the death of the king or violate the chastity of the queen ; and this upon the same reason as was before given, because the prince of Wales is next in succession to the crown, and to violate his wife might taint the blood-royal with bastardy. And the eldest daughter of the king is also alone inheritable to the crown on failure of issue male, and therefore more respected by the laws than any of her younger sisters; insomuch that upon this, united with other principles, whilst our military tenures were in force, the king might levy an aid for marrying his eldest daughter, and her only. The heir apparent to the crown is usually made Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester, by special creation and investiture; but being the king’s eldest son, he is by inheritance Duke of Cornwall, without any new creation.</p><p>3.    The rest of the royal family may be considered in two different lights, according to the different senses in which the term <hi rend="italic">royal family</hi>  is used. The larger sense includes all those who are by any possibility inheritable to the crown. Such, before the Revolution, were all the descendants of William the Conqueror, who had branched into an amazing extent by intermarriages with the ancient nobility. Since the Revolution and Act of Settlement, it means the Protestant issue of the Princess Sophia, now comparatively few in number, but which in process of time may possibly be as largely diffused. The more confined sense includes only those who are in a certain degree of propinquity to the reigning prince, and to whom therefore the law pays an extraordinary regard and respect; but after that degree is past, they fall into the rank of ordinary subjects, and are seldom considered any further unless called to the succession upon failure of the nearer lines. For though collateral consanguinity is regarded indefinitely with respect to inheritance or succession, yet it is and can only be regarded within some certain limits in any other respect, by the natural constitution of things and the dictates of' positive law.</p><p>By statute 12 Geo. III. c. 11, no descendant of the body of Geo. II. other than the issue of princesses married into foreign families, is capable of contracting matrimony, without the previous consent of the king signified under the great seal; and any marriage contracted without such a consent is void. It is provided, however, that such of the said descendants as are not above twenty-five, may, after a twelvemonth’s notice given to the king’s privy council, contract and solemnize marriage without the consent of the crown, unless both houses of parliament shall, before the expiration of the said year, expressly declare their disapprobation of such intended marriage ; and all persons solemnizing, assisting, or being present at any such prohibited marriage, shall incur the penalties of the statute of <hi rend="italic">præmunire.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Royal Oak, a fair spreading tree at Boscobel, in the parish of Donnington, in Staffordshire, the boughs of which</hi></p><lb/><p>were once covered with ivy, in the thick of which King Charles II. sat in the day-time with Colonel Careless, and in the night lodged in Boscobel House. They are mistaken who speak of it as an old hollow oak, it being then a gay flourishing tree, surrounded with many more. Its poor remains were fenced in with a handsome wall, with this inscription in gold letters: <hi rend="italic">Felicissimam arborem quam in asylum potentissimi regis Carols II.

There was here an ancient priory, said to have been founded in the reign of Henry II. by a lady of the name of Roysia, from whom the town takes its name. The chapel of the priory now serves as the parish church. There is a large market held on Thursday, at which much corn is sold. There are some considerable brewers. The population amounted in 1811 to 1331, in 1821 to 1474, and in 1831 to 1757.</p><p>RSHOVV Waldimirow', a city of Russia, in the province of Twer, and the capital of a circle of the same name. It is situated on the river Volga, where it receives the waters of the Ryolenka. It contains twelve churches, 1252 houses, and 7500 inhabitants. It has considerable trade by the river in the productions of the land, and some manufactures. Long. 34. 29. E. Lat. 56. 10.

It is pleasantly situated on an elevation, and has a neat church, with some elegant monuments to the family of Sir Watkins William Wynn, whose magnificent seat of Wynnstay is near to it. The agricultural society established at this place has much contributed to the improvement of the soil and of cultivation. The population amounted in 1801 to 5598, in 1811 to 6122, in 1821 to 8556, and in 1831 to 8353 ; but it includes the whole parish, which comprehended five townships.</p><p>RUANELLI, a valley in the island of Ceylon, famed for its precious stones. The river on which Columbo, the capital, is situated, is navigable to this place by boats. The precious stones and other metallic substances are found in the environs of Ruanelli, amongst the sand and gravel of the river. They consist chiefly of sapphires, topazes, garnets, amethysts, moonstone, tourmalines, and cats-eyes. The land is let on short leases to the highest bidder ; and although they are exempted from duties, it produces, after all, but a trifling revenue.</p><p>RUBBER, India.

His father, who was a counsellor in the senate of Antwerp, had been forced by the civil wars to seek refuge in Cologne; and during his residence there Rubens is commonly said to have been born.</p><p>The genius of Rubens, which began to unfold itself in his earliest years, was cultivated with peculiar care, and embellished with every branch of classical and polite literature. He soon discovered a strong inclination for designing, and used to amuse himself with that employment in his leisure hours, whilst the rest of his time was devoted to other studies. His mother, perceiving the bias of her son, permitted him to attend the instructions of Tobias Verhaecht, a painter of architecture and of landscape. He next became the pupil of Adam Van Oort; but he soon found that the abilities of this master were insufficient to answer his elevated ideas.
