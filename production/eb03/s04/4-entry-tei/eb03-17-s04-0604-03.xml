(William), an eminent Engliſh antiquary, was born at Canterbury in 1606. His firſt treatiſe was The Antiquities of Canterbury, which he dedicated to Archbiſhop Laud. He then applied himself to the ſtudy of the Saxon language ; and having made himſelf maſter of it, he perceived that the old gloſſary prefixed to Sir Roger Twisden’s edition of the laws of King Henry I. printed in 1644, was faulty in many places; he therefore added to that edition notes and obſervations valuable for their learning, with a very uſeful gloſſary. His Treatiſe of Gavelkind was finiſhed about 1648, though not publiſhed till 1660. Our author was zealouſly attached to King Charles I. and in 1648 he publiſhed a poem on his ſufferings and death. His skill in the Saxon tongue led him to inquire into moſt of the European languages ancient and modern. He aſſiſted Dugdale and Dodlworth in compiling the <hi rend="italic">Monasticon Anglicanum.</hi> His Saxon Dictionary was printed at Oxford in 1659. died in 1669.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
