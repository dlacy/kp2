In a note to his eighteenth lecture, Dr. Blair mentions that he had borrowed several of the ideas respecting the general characters of style, particularly the plain and simple, and the characters of those English authors who are classed under them, from a manuscript treatise of Dr. Smith on Rhetoric, of which the author had shewn him a part.</p><p>In consequence of his increasing celebrity, Dr. Smith was elected, in 1751, professor of logic in the University of Glasgow ; and the year following he was elevated to the chair of moral philosophy in the same University, vacant by the death of Mr. Craigie, the immediate successor of the celebrated Dr. Hutcheson, under whom Dr. Smith had formerly studied. He continued to hold this situation for thirteen years ; and, as the studies and inquiries in which his academical duties daily engaged him, were the most agreeable to his taste, it is not surprising that he should have considered the period of his residence at Glasgow as the happiest portion of his life. At the same time, it seems reasonable to conclude that his professional pursuits must have had a great effect in maturing his speculations in morals and politics, and, consequently, in determining him to undertake those great works which have immortalized his name, and largely benefited the whole human race.</p><p>Mr. Millar, the distinguished author of the <hi rend="italic">Historical View of the English Government,</hi> and professor of law in the University of Glasgow, had the advantage of hearing Dr. Smith’s course of lectures on moral philosophy ; of which he has given the following account : “ There was no situation in which the abilities of Dr. Smith appeared to greater advantage than as a professor. In delivering bis lectures, he trusted almost entirely to extemporary elocution. His manner, though not graceful, was plain and unaffected ; and, as he seemed to be always interested in the subject, he never failed to interest his hearers. Each discourse consisted commonly of several distinct propositions, which he successively endeavoured to prove and illustrate. These propositions, when announced in general terms, had, from their extent, not unfrequently something of the air of a paradox. In his attempts to explain them, he often appeared, at first, not to be always interested in the subject, and spoke with some hesitation. As he advanced, however, the matter seemed to crowd upon him, his manner became warm and animated, and his expression easy anti fluent. In points susceptible of controversy, you could easily discern, that he secretly conceived an opposition to his opinions, and that he was led upon this account to support them with greater energy and vehemence. By the fulness and variety of his illustrations, the subject gradually swelled in his hands, and acquired a dimension which, without a tedious repetition of the same views, was calculated to seize the attention of his audience, and to afford them pleasure, as well as instruction, in following the same object through all the diversity of shades and aspects in which it was presented, and afterwards in tracing it backwards to that original proposition or general truth from which this beautiful train of speculation had proceeded.</p><p>“ His reputation as a professor was accordingly raised very high, and a multitude of students from a great distance resorted to the University, merely upon his account. Those branches of science which he taught became fashionable at this place, and his opinions were the chief topic of discus</p><p>sion in clubs and literary societies. Even the small peculiarities in his pronunciation or manner of speaking became frequently the objects of imitation.”</p><p>It is understood that Dr. Smith made his debut as an author by contributing, anonymously, two articles to a publication entitled the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> commenced in 1755, of which only two numbers were published. The first of these articles is a review of Dr. Johnson’s Dictionary, and displays considerable acuteness ; the second is in the form of a letter to the editor, and contains some general observations on the literature of the different European countries. It is chiefly remarkable as evincing the attention paid by the author to continental literature, at a period when it was comparatively neglected in this country.</p><p>In 1759 Smith published his <hi rend="italic">Theory of Moral Sentiments.</hi> He had been engaged for a very considerable period in the composition of this work, which is throughout elaborated with the greatest care. The fundamental principle maintained by the author is, that <hi rend="italic">sympathy</hi> forms the real foundation of morals ; that we do not immediately approve or disapprove of any given action, when we have become acquainted with the intention of the agent and the consequences of what he has done, but that we previously enter, by means of that sympathetic affection which is natural to us, into the feelings of the agent and those to whom the action relates ; that, having considered all the motives, and passions by which the agent was actuated, we pronounce, with respect to the <hi rend="italic">propriety </hi>or<hi rend="italic"> impropriety</hi> of the action, according as we sympathize or not with him ; while we pronounce, with respect to the <hi rend="italic">merit</hi> or <hi rend="italic">demerit</hi> of the action, according as we sympathize with the gratitude or resentment of those who were its objects ; and that we necessarily judge of our own conduct by comparing it with such maxims and rules as we have deduced from observations previously made on the conduct of others.</p><p>Several, and, as it is now generally admitted, some unanswerable, objections have been urged against this most ingenious theory. But, whatever difference of opinion may exist with respect to the truth of the principle it involves, the <hi rend="italic">Theory of Moral Sentiments</hi> has been universally allowed to abound in the most admirable disquisitions, in a faithful and skilful delineation of character, and in the soundest and most elevated maxims for the practical regulation of human life. The style various, but always eloquent, is worthy of the subject ; and while it serves, by the beauty and richness of its colouring, to relieve the dryness of some of the more abstract discussions, it gives additional force to the powerful recommendations of generous, upright, and disinterested conduct to be found in every part of the work.</p><p>Dr. Brown, who has criticised this theory with his usual acuteness, and has shewn that though sympathy may diffuse moral sentiments, it can never originate them, bears, notwithstanding, the strongest testimony to the transcendent merits of Dr. Smith’s work. “ The <hi rend="italic">Theory of Moral Sentiments,”</hi> he observes, “ is, without all question, one of the most interesting works, perhaps I should have said the most interesting work, in moral science. It is valuable, however, as I before remarked, not for the leading doctrine, of which we have seen the fallacy, but for the minor theories which are adduced in illustration of it ; for the refined analysis which it exhibits in many of its details ; and for an eloquence which, adapting itself to all the temporary varieties of its subject, familiar, with a sort of majestic grace, and simple even in its magnificence, can play amid the little decencies and proprieties of common life, or rise to all the dignity of that sublime and celestial virtue, which it seems to bring from heaven indeed, but to bring down gently and humbly, to the bosom of man.”@@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p><p><hi rend="superscript">@@@1</hi> Brown's Lectures, vol. iv. p. 132. edit 1824.</p></body></text></TEI>
