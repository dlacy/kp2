<p><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">theatre. The machinery has </span><span class="font1">no other firm </span><span class="font0">points to •which it can be attached ; and the portion of the Angle&nbsp;rafters which carry this king-poſt are but ſhort, and&nbsp;therefore may be conſiderably loaded with ſafety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We obſerve in the drawings which we ſometimes have of Chineſe buildings, that the truſſing of roofs is&nbsp;underſtood by them. Indeed they muſt be very experienced carpenters. We ſee wooden buildings run up&nbsp;to a great height, which can be ſupported only by ſuch&nbsp;truſſing. One of theſe is ſketched in ſig. 21. There&nbsp;are ſome very excellent ſpecimens to be ſeen in the&nbsp;buildings at Deptford, belonging to the victualling-office, uſually called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Red Houſe,</span><span class="font0"> which were erected&nbsp;about the year 1788, and we believe are the performance of Mr James Arrow of the Board of Works,&nbsp;one of the moſt intelligent artiſts in this kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus have we given an elementary, but a rational or Scientific, account of this important part of the art of&nbsp;carpentry. It is ſuch, that any practitioner, with the&nbsp;troubleof a little reflection, may always proceed with confidence, and without reſting any part of his practice on the&nbsp;vague notions which habit may have given him of the&nbsp;ſtrength and ſupports of timbers, and of their manner of&nbsp;acting. That theſe frequently miſlead, is proved by the&nbsp;mutual criticiſms which are frequently publiſhed by the&nbsp;rivals in the proſeſſion. They have frequently ſagacity&nbsp;enough (for it can ſeldom be called ſcſence ) to point&nbsp;out glaring blunders ; and any perſon who will look at&nbsp;ſome of the performances of Mr Price, Mr Wyatt, Mr&nbsp;Arrow, and others of acknowdedged reputation, will&nbsp;readily ſee them diſtinguiſhable from the works of inferior artiſts by ſimplicity alone. A man without principles is apt to conſider an intricate conſtruction as ingenious and effectual ; and ſuch roofs ſometimes fail merely&nbsp;by being ingeniouſly loaded with timber, but more frequently ſtill by the wrong action of ſome uſeleſs piece,&nbsp;which produces ſtrains that are tranſverſe to other&nbsp;pieces, or which, by rendering ſome points too firm,&nbsp;cauſe them to be deſerted by the reſt in the general&nbsp;fubſiding of the whole. Inſtances of this kind are pointed out by Price in his Britiſh Carpenter. Nothing&nbsp;ihows the ſkill of a carpenter more than the diſtinctneſs&nbsp;with which he can foreſee the changes of ſhape which&nbsp;muſt take place in a ſhort time in every roof. A&nbsp;knowledge of this will often correct a conſtruction&nbsp;which the mere mathematician thinks unexceptionable,&nbsp;becauſe he does not reckon on the actual compreſſion&nbsp;which muſt obtain, and imagines that his triangles,&nbsp;which ſuſtain no croſs ſtrains, invariably retain their&nbsp;ſhape till the pieces break. The ſagacity of the experienced carpenter is not, however, enough without fci-ence for perfecting the art. But when he knows how&nbsp;much a particular piece will yield to compreſſion in one&nbsp;caſe, ſcience will tell him, and nothing but ſcience can&nbsp;do it, what will be the compreſſion of the ſame piece in&nbsp;another very different caſe. Thus he learns how far it&nbsp;will now yield, and then he proportions the parts ſo&nbsp;to each other, that when all have yielded according to&nbsp;their ſtrains, the whole is of the ſhape he wiſhed to&nbsp;produce, and every joint is in a ſtate of firmneſs. It is&nbsp;here that we obſerve the greateſt number of improprieties. The iron ſtraps are frequently in poſitions not&nbsp;ſuited to the actual ſtrain on them, and they are in a&nbsp;ſtate of violent twiſt, which both tends ſtrongly to</span></p><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font1">break the ſtrap, and to cripple the pieces which they ſurround.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">In like manner, we frequently ſee joints or mortiſes in a ſtate of violent ſtrain on the tenons, or on the&nbsp;heels and ſhoulders. The joints were perhaps properly&nbsp;ſhaped to the primitive form of the truſs ; but by its&nbsp;ſettling, the bearing on the puſh is changed : the brace,&nbsp;for example, in a very low pitched roof, comes to preſs&nbsp;with the upper part of the ſhoulder, and, acting as a&nbsp;powerful lever on the tenon, breaks it. In like manner,&nbsp;the lower end of the brace, which at firſt butted firmly&nbsp;and ſquarely on the joggle of the king-poſt, now preſſes&nbsp;with one corner with prodigious force, and ſeldom fails&nbsp;to ſplinter off on that fide. We cannot help recommending a maxim of Mr Perronet the celebrated hydraulic architect of France, as a golden rule, viz. to&nbsp;make all the ſhoulders of butting pieces in the form of&nbsp;an arch of a circle, having the oppoſite end of the piece&nbsp;for its centre. Thus, in ſig. 18. if the joggle-joint B&nbsp;be of this form, having A for its centre, the ſagging of&nbsp;the roof will make no partial bearing at the joint ; for&nbsp;in the ſagging of the roof, the piece AB turns or bends&nbsp;round the centre A, and the counter-preſſure of the&nbsp;joggle is ſtill directed to A, as it ought to be. We&nbsp;have juſt now ſaid </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bends</span><span class="font0"> round A. This is too frequently the caſe, and it is always very difficult to give&nbsp;the tenon and mortiſe in this place a true and invariable&nbsp;bearing. The rafter puſhes in the direction BA, and&nbsp;the beam reſiſts in the direction AD. The abutment&nbsp;ſhould be perpendicular to neither of theſe but in an&nbsp;intermediate direction, and it ought alſo to be of a curved ſhape. But the carpenters perhaps think that&nbsp;this would weaken the beam too much to give it this&nbsp;ſhape in the ſhoulder ; they do not even aim at it in&nbsp;the heel of the tenon. The ſhoulder is commonly even&nbsp;with the ſurface of the beam. When the bearing therefore is on this ſhoulder, it cauſes the foot of the rafter&nbsp;to Aide along the beam till the heel of the tenon bears&nbsp;againſt the outer end of the mortiſe (See Price’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bri-tilh Carpenter,</span><span class="font0"> Plate C. fig. I K). This abutment&nbsp;is perpendicular to the beam in Price’s book, but it is&nbsp;more generally pointed a little outwards below, to make&nbsp;it more ſecure againſt ſtarting. The conſequence of&nbsp;this conſtruction is, that when the roof ſettles, the&nbsp;ſhoulder comes to bear at the inner end of the mortiſe,&nbsp;and it riſes at the outer, and the tenon taking hold of&nbsp;the wood beyond it, either tears ſt out or is itſelf broken. This joint therefore is ſeldom trailed to the&nbsp;ſtrength of the mortiſe and tenon, and is uſually ſecu-red by an iron ſtrap, which lies obliquely to the beam,&nbsp;to which it is bolted by a large bolt quite through, and&nbsp;then embraces the outſide of the rafter foot. Very frequently this ſtrap is not made ſuſſiciently oblique, and&nbsp;we have ſeen ſome made almoſt ſquare with the beam.&nbsp;When this is the caſe, it not only keeps the foot of the&nbsp;rafter from flying out, but it binds it down. In this&nbsp;caſe, the rafter acts as a powerful lever, whoſe fu}crum&nbsp;is the inner angle of the ſhoulder, and then the ſtrap&nbsp;never fails to cripple the rafter at the point. All this&nbsp;can be prevented only by making the ſtrap very long&nbsp;and very oblique, and by making its outer end (the&nbsp;ſtirrup part) ſquare with its length, and making a notch&nbsp;in the rafter foot to receive it. It cannot now cripple&nbsp;the rafter, for it will riſe along with it, turning round</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
