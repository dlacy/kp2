<p><span class="font0">• If the body is of ſuch a ſhape, that the forces in the plane DCG do not balance each other, we ſhall then&nbsp;diſcover a momentum round an axis perpendicular to&nbsp;this plane. Compound this rotation in the ſame manner&nbsp;with the rotation round D </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And from this ſimple view of the matter we learn (what would be difficult to diſcover in the other way),&nbsp;that when the centre of percuſſion does not coincide&nbsp;with that of rotation, the axis is in the plane DGC,&nbsp;though not perpendicular to PG. But when there is&nbsp;a momentum round an axis perpendicular to this plane,&nbsp;the incipient axis of rotation is neither perpendicular to&nbsp;PC, nor in a plane perpendicular to that paſſing through&nbsp;the centre in the direction of the impelling force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We muſt content ourſelves with merely pointing out theſe tracks of inveſtigation to the curious reader, and&nbsp;recommending the cultivation of this moſt fruitful theorem of Father Friſi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theſe are by no means ſpeculations of mere curioſity, intereſting to none but mathematicians : the nobleſt art&nbsp;which is practiſedby man muſt receive great improvement&nbsp;from a complete knowledge of this ſubject. We mean&nbsp;the art of seamanship. A ſhip, the moſt admirable&nbsp;6f machines, muſt be conſidered as a body in free&nbsp;ſpace, impelled by the winds and waters, and continually moved round ſpontaneous axes of converſion, and&nbsp;inceſſantly checked in theſe movements. The trimming&nbsp;of the ſails, the action of the rudder, the very diſpoſition of the loading, all affect her verſatility. An experienced ſeaman knows by habit how to produce and&nbsp;facilitate theſe motions, and to check or ſtop ſuch as&nbsp;are inconvenient. Experience, without any reflection&nbsp;or knowledge how and why, informs him what poſition&nbsp;qf the rudder produces a deviation from the courſe. A&nbsp;fort of common ſenſe tells him, that, in order to make&nbsp;the ſhip turn her head away from the wind, he muſt increaſe the ſuri'ace or the obliquity of the head ſails, and&nbsp;diminiſh the power of the ſails near the ſtern. A few&nbsp;other operations are dictated to him by this kind of&nbsp;common ſenſe ; but few, even of old ſeamen, can tell&nbsp;why a ſhip has ſuch a tendency to bring her head up&nbsp;in the wind, and why it is ſo neceſſary to crowd the&nbsp;tore part oſ the ſhip with ſails ; fewer ſtill know that a&nbsp;certain ſhifting of the loading will facilitate ſome motions in different caſes ; that the crew of a great ſhip&nbsp;running ſuddenly to a particular place ſhall enable the&nbsp;ſhip tcx accompliih a movement in a ſtormy ſea which&nbsp;could not be done otherwiſe ; and perhaps not one in&nbsp;ten thouſand can tell why this procedure will be ſucceſs-ful. But the mathematical inquirer will ſee all this ;&nbsp;and it would be a moſt valuable acquifition to the public, to have a manual of ſuch propoſitions, deduced from&nbsp;a careful and judicious conſideration of the circumſtances, and freed from that great complication and intricacy which only the learned can unravel, and expreffed&nbsp;in a familiar manner, clothed with ſuch reaſoning as&nbsp;will be intelligible to the unlearned ; and though not&nbsp;accurate, yet perſuaſive. Mr Bouguer, in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">'Traité du&nbsp;Navire,</span><span class="font0"> and in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Manœuvre des Paiſſeaux,</span><span class="font0"> has delivered a great deal of uſeful information on this ſubject ;&nbsp;and Mr Bezout has made a very uſeful abſtract of theſe&nbsp;works in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cours de Mathématique.</span><span class="font0"> But the ſubject&nbsp;iβ left by them </span><span class="font1">in a </span><span class="font0">form far too abſtruſe to be of </span><span class="font1">any&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">general uſe : and it is unfortunately ſo combined with&nbsp;or founded on a falſe theory of the action and reſiſtance of fluids, that many of the propoſitions are totally&nbsp;inconſiſtent with experience, and many maxims of ſea-manſhip are falſe. This has occaſioned theſe doctrines&nbsp;to bc neglected altogether. Few of our proſeſſional&nbsp;ſeamen have the preparatory knowledge neceſſary for&nbsp;improving the ſcience ; but it would be a work of immenſe utility, and would acquire great reputation to the&nbsp;perſon who ſucceſsfully proſecutes it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Rothſay gives the title of Duke to the prince of Scotland, a title which was formerly accompanied with&nbsp;ſuitable revenues, powers, and privileges. Of the origin of this title we have the following account ſrom the&nbsp;pen of the learned Dr M<sup>t</sup>Leod of Glaſgow. Some&nbsp;time between the 16th of March and the 26th of October 1398, John of Gaunt, who is ſtyled John duke&nbsp;of Aquitaine and Lancaſter, uncle to the king of England, and David, who is ſtyled earl of Carrick, eldeſt ſon&nbsp;of the king of Scotland, met for the purpoſe of ſettling&nbsp;the borders, and terminating all mattere in diſpute. At&nbsp;a ſubſequent interview between the ſame parties, David&nbsp;is ſtyled Duke of Rothſay. “ This innovation probably proceeded on an idea, to which the interview of&nbsp;the two princes might naturally give riſe, that it was&nbsp;unſuitable, and unworthy of the Scottiſh national dignity, that the princes of England ſhould enjoy a title&nbsp;of nobility, which was eſteemed to be of higher rank&nbsp;than that poffeſſed by the hereditary prince of Scotland.” And this, in the opinion of our author, was the&nbsp;occaſion of introducing the title of Duke into Scotland.</span></p>
