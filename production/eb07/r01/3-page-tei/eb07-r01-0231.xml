The triumph of Mr Bosanquet and his friends was, however, of very short duration. Mr Ricardo did not hesitate to attack this formidable adversary in his stronghold. His second tract, entitled “ Reply to Mr Bosanquet's Practical Observations on the Report of the Bullion Committee,” was published in 1811, and is perhaps the best controversial essay that has ever appeared on any disputed question of political economy. In this pamphlet, Mr Ricardo met Mr Bosanquet on his own ground, and overthrew him with his own weapons. He examined all the proofs which Mr Bosanquet had brought forward, of the pretended discordance between the</p><p>principles advanced in his own pamphlet, and in the Bullion</p><p>Report, and experience ; and showed that Mr Bosanquet had either mistaken the cases by which he proposed to try the theory, or that the discrepancy was only apparent, and was entirely a consequence of his inability to apply the principle, and not of any deficiency in the principle itself. The victory of Mr Ricardo was perfect and complete ; and the elaborate errors and mis-statements of Mr Bosanquet served only, in the language of Dr Copleston, “ to illustrate the abilities of the writer who stepped forward to vindicate the truth.”@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi> This tract affords a striking example of the ascendency which those who possess a knowledge both of principle and practice, have over those familiar only with the latter ; and though the interest of the question which gave rise to it be now subsided, it will always be read with delight by such as are not insensible of the high gratification which all ingenuous minds must feel in observing the ease with which a superior intellect clears away the irrelevant matter with which a question has been designedly embarrassed, reduces false facts to their just value, and traces and exhibits the constant and active operation of the same general principle through all the mazy intricacies of practical detail.</p><p>The merit of these pamphlets was duly appreciated ; and Mr Ricardo’s society was, in consequence, courted by men of the first eminence and consideration, who were not less delighted with his modesty, and the mildness and amenity of his manners, than with the reach and vigour of his understanding. It was at this period that he formed that intimacy with Mr Malthus, and Mr Mill, the author of the History of British India, which ended only with his life. To Mr Mill he was particularly attached ; and he always felt pleasure in acknowledging how much he owed to the friendship, and to the clear, discriminating judgment of that gentleman.</p><p>Mr Ricardo’s next appearance as an author was in 1815, during the discussions on the bill, afterwards passed into a law, for raising the limit at which the importation of foreign corn should be permitted, to 80s. Mr Malthus, and a “ Fellow of University College, Oxford” (Mr West, afterwards Sir Edward West), had, in two able pamphlets, published almost at the same moment, developed the real nature, origin, and causes of rent.@@<hi rend="sup">2</hi> But neither of them perceived the real value and importance of the principles which they had established. This was reserved for Mr Ricardo, who, in his “ Essay on the Influence of a Low Price of Corn on the Profits of Stock,” showed the real effect of the increase which must always take place in the price of raw produce, in the progress of society, on wages and profits ; and founded an irresistible argument in favour of the freedom of the corn trade, on the very principles from which Mr Malthus had vainly endeavoured to show the propriety of subjecting it to fresh restrictions. This essay is particularly worthy of attention, as it contains a brief statement of some of the fundamental principles subsequently demonstrated in the “ Principles of Political Economy and Taxation.”</p><p>In 1816, Mr Ricardo published his “ Proposals for an Economical and Secure Currency, with Observations on the Profits of the Bank of England.” In this pamphlet Mr Ricardo examined the circumstances which determine the value of money, both when every individual has the power to supply it, and when that power is restricted and placed under a monopoly : he showed that, in the former case, its value depends, like that of all freely produced commodities, wholly on the cost of its production; while in the latter its value is quite unaffected by that circumstance, and depends entirely on the extent to which it has been issued compared with the demand. This is a principle of great importance ; for it shows that intrinsic worth is not necessary to a currency, and that, provided the supply of paper-notes, declared to be legal tender, be sufficiently limited, their value may be maintained on a par with that of gold, or raised to any higher level. If, therefore, it were possible to devise a system for preserving the value of paper on a level with gold, without making it convertible into coin at the pleasure of the holder, the whole of the expenses attending the use of a metallic currency would be saved. To effect this object, Mr Ricardo proposed that bank-notes, instead of being made exchangeable for gold coins, should be made exchangeable for <hi rend="italic">bars of gold bullion of the standard weight and purity.</hi>  This device was obviously calculated to check the over-issue of paper quite as effectually as it could be checked by making it convertible into coin ; while, as the bars could not be used as currency, it prevented any gold from getting into circulation. Mr Ricardo’s proposal was recommended in the Reports of the Committees of the Houses of Lords and Commons, appointed in 1819, to consider the expediency of the bank’s resuming cash-payments, and was afterwards adopted in the celebrated bill introduced by Mr (now Sir Robert) Peel, for the resumption of cash payments. But though the plan secured all the advantages which Mr Ricardo had in view, these were not the only considerations that had to be attended</p><lb/><p>@@@ First Letter to the Right Hon.

But the investigations and discoveries of Anderson did not attract any attention, and were, indeed, totally forgotten ; so that it was necessary the theory of rent should be re-stated (it is believed to Iiave been re-discovered), to make it be understood and appreciated by the public.</p></body></text></TEI>
