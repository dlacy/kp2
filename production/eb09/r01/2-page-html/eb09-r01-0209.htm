The Louvre contains twenty of his pictures, the National Gallery of&nbsp;London seven, and others were once there, now removed to other&nbsp;public collections. The most interesting of the seven is the small&nbsp;Coronation of the Virgin, painted on copper, an elegantly finished&nbsp;work, more pretty than beautiful. It was probably painted before&nbsp;the master quitted Bologna for Rome.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RENNELL, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">James </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(1742-1830), probably the most celebrated of English geographers, was born on 3d December 1742, near Chudleigh in Devonshire, where his&nbsp;father John Rennell, a man apparently of gentle blood,&nbsp;was the owner of a small farm called Waddon.@@<sup>1</sup> The&nbsp;register of Chudleigh records the baptism of James&nbsp;Rennell on 21st December. John Rennell, who had&nbsp;married Ann Clark in 1738, seems to have fallen into&nbsp;embarrassed circumstances, and to have taken service in the&nbsp;artillery, with which he served in the duke of Cumberland’s&nbsp;campaign in Flanders of 1747-48. The date of his death&nbsp;is uncertain, but he appears never to have rejoined his&nbsp;family. As a boy the son James found a valuable friend&nbsp;in the then vicar of Chudleigh, Gilbert Burrington, by&nbsp;whose advice and assistance he entered the navy in the&nbsp;beginning of 1756. Throughout his Indian career Rennell&nbsp;kept up a regular correspondence with Mr Burrington,&nbsp;and always regarded him with affection and gratitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The earliest of Rennell’s existing letters show him, in March 1758, as an acting midshipman on board the “ Brilliant,” 36, Captain Parker, afterwards the famous Admiral&nbsp;Sir Hyde Parker, the elder of two of that name. When&nbsp;attached to the “ Brilliant ” James Rennell was present&nbsp;at several of those desultory expeditions against the French&nbsp;coast and shipping on which so much strength was squandered in the wars with France. Among these was a&nbsp;landing directed against the works and ships at Cherbourg&nbsp;(August 1758), and two other expeditions to the vicinity of&nbsp;St Malo, which were more futile, and the last of which&nbsp;ended somewhat disastrously. A MS. plan of the Bay of&nbsp;St Cast, where the x־e-embarkation took place (September&nbsp;11, 1758), executed by James Rennell at the age of sixteen,&nbsp;and probably his first attempt at topographical work, is&nbsp;now before us. It bears the inscription “ Plan of St Cas&nbsp;Bay, J.· Rennel feet. 1758. To the Rt. Honble. Lord&nbsp;Howe this plan is dedicated by his obedient humble&nbsp;servant, J. Rennel.”@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1760 Captain Parker, leaving the “Brilliant,” took the “Norfolk” to India, and Rennell was to have gone&nbsp;with him, but through some accident missed his ship and&nbsp;went out in the “America,” 50, Captain Haldane. On&nbsp;reaching India he rejoined Captain Parker, now in command of the “Grafton,” 58, with the fleet engaged in&nbsp;the blockade of Pondicherry, which Coote was besieging&nbsp;on the landward side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Annual Register</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> for 1830, in a sketch of Rennell’s career, gives an anecdote for which we cannot vouch,&nbsp;finding no allusion to it in his letters. It is to the effect</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">that, some sloops of war belonging to the enemy being moored in shallow water, Rennell asked the use of a boat.&nbsp;Accompanied by one sailor he reconnoitred the sloops, and&nbsp;ascertained what he had surmised to be true, viz., that&nbsp;owing to an unusually high tide it was possible to reach&nbsp;those vessels. This information was acted on with complete success. Whatever amount of truth there may be&nbsp;in this anecdote, we know, at least, from his letters that&nbsp;he took part in the cutting out of the “ Baleine ” and&nbsp;“Hermione,” the former a 40-gun frigate, the latter an&nbsp;armed Indiaman, both at anchor before Pondicherry,&nbsp;within a half musket-shot of the place, and that he was a&nbsp;volunteer in one of the boat divisions which attacked the&nbsp;“ Baleine.” This vessel had no sails bent, and the captors,&nbsp;being exposed for an hour to a very heavy fire from the&nbsp;ramparts, lost severely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We do not know what good guidance had first turned the lad’s attention to surveying, but his letters show that&nbsp;he went to India provided with useful books and instruments, and they contain from time to time notices of&nbsp;various surveys executed by him, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the harbour of&nbsp;Trinconomal¿ (or Trincomalee, as we now call it), and of the&nbsp;bay and roads of Diego Rayes,@@<sup>3</sup> whither the East Indian&nbsp;fleet had gone as the rendezvous of an intended attack on&nbsp;Mauritius, which did not come off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Captain Parker appears to have been friendly to Rennell, but had little hope of obtaining promotion in the navy&nbsp;for him, and counselled him to try his fortune in the&nbsp;Company’s service. Rennell acquiesced, and in the summer&nbsp;of 1762 went, apparently as a surveyor, on board a&nbsp;Company’s vessel which was despatched on a reconnaissance to Manila and the neighbouring islands. The only&nbsp;trace we have been able to find of this voyage consists in&nbsp;sundry charts and coast-views published by Alexander&nbsp;Dalrymple, a friend of Rennell’s in after days. Such are&nbsp;the Bay of Camorta in the Nicobar Islands, 1762;&nbsp;View of Quedah; Chart of Sambeelan Islands in the&nbsp;Straits of Malacca, 1763 ; View of Malacca, July, 1762;&nbsp;Chart of Abai Harbour, on north-west of Borneo, 1762.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Of the expedition we have no particulars, but we gather that Rennell looked back on his treatment and service on board with&nbsp;dissatisfaction, though his performance of the duties assigned him&nbsp;recommended him as a man of merit to the authorities at Fort&nbsp;St George. He had missed a great chance in the navy, for during&nbsp;his absence orders came for the expedition against Manila, which&nbsp;ended in the capture of that place in 1762,—an expedition in&nbsp;which Captain Parker took the “Santissima Trinidad,” a prize of&nbsp;enormous value. Rennell, however, made many friends at Madras,&nbsp;and had several offers of employment, though he did not think&nbsp;himself at liberty to accept any till the return of Captain Parker&nbsp;and his final discharge from the “Grafton’s” books (July 1763).&nbsp;He now obtained the command of a vessel in the Government&nbsp;service, but whilst she lay off Madras, shortly afterwards, a cyclone&nbsp;destroyed every ship save one in the roads, and Rennell’s among&nbsp;them. Fortunately he was on shore when the gale came on ; but&nbsp;he lost everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The city of Madura was then being besieged by a British force in combination with one sent by the nawab of the Carnatic ; and&nbsp;Mr Palk, governor of Fort St George, employed Rennell@@<sup>4</sup> to&nbsp;superintend the landing of troops and stores for that operation.&nbsp;For his conduct of this service he received the thanks of the&nbsp;Government and a handsome present. Apparently about this time</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several branches of the family round Chudleigh, and&nbsp;the name occurs on several monuments in Chudleigh church. Four&nbsp;generations of Thomas Rennells, clergymen of some note, were&nbsp;reckoned as relations by Janies Rennell:—(1) T. Rennell, fellow of&nbsp;Exeter College, Oxford, M.A. of 1699, rector of Bishop’s Leighton ;&nbsp;(2) T. R., rector of Barnack, called “a very profound scholar . . .&nbsp;with a rich library (3) T. R., of King’s College, Cambridge, master&nbsp;of the Temple, and dean of Winchester ; (4) T. R., editor of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">British Critic,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Christian advocate at Cambridge, vicar of Kensington.&nbsp;As Rennell calls the second his cousin, the first was probably his&nbsp;grandfather’s brother ; he could hardly have been his father’s brother&nbsp;on account of the dates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He writes the name indifferently Rennel and Rennell till February&nbsp;2, 1760, when he says to Mr Burrington :—“You desired that in&nbsp;future I would write my name with a double </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">l.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> I shall in the future,&nbsp;but am inclined to think it will be of little use to me.” There is,&nbsp;we believe, here some reference to the clerical relations, whom he&nbsp;at that time thought neglectful.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@3</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Rennell’s notice of its size and position this is evidently the&nbsp;island now called Rodriguez, about 350 miles north-east of Mauritius.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@4</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This siege of Madura belongs to an obscure passage of Indian&nbsp;history, an account of which must be sought in Nelson’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Manual of&nbsp;Madura</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Madras, 1868), and Bishop Caldwell’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">History of Tinnerelly&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Madras, 1881). Mohammed Yusuf Khan, a man of great ability,&nbsp;who had been “ commander of all the Company’s sepoys” (at Madras),&nbsp;and afterwards governor of Madura for the nawab and the Company,&nbsp;threw off his allegiance in the beginning of 1763. A joint expedition&nbsp;was sent against him, and for a long time had indifferent success.&nbsp;Eventually Marchand, the chief of a French contingent in Yusufs&nbsp;service, betrayed him to the English commandant, and in the latter&nbsp;part of 1764 it is said that he was hanged, whether by order of the&nbsp;Fort St George Government or of the nawab is doubtful.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
