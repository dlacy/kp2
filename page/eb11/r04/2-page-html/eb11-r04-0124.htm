<p><span class="font1">and the forum was heaped high with the bodies of the slain.@@<sup>1 </sup>Cinna fled, but fled, like Sulla, to the legions. When the senate&nbsp;declared him deposed from his consulship, he replied by invoking&nbsp;the aid of the soldiers in Campania in behalf of the violated&nbsp;rights of the people and the injured dignity of the consulship,&nbsp;and, like Sulla, found them ready to follow where he led. The&nbsp;neighbouring Italian communities, who had lost many citizens&nbsp;in the recent massacre, sent their new champion men and&nbsp;money;@@<sup>2</sup> while from Africa, whither he had escaped after&nbsp;Sulla’s entry into Rome, came Marius with 1000 Numidian&nbsp;horsemen. The senate had prepared for a desperate defence,&nbsp;but fortune was adverse, and after a brief resistance they gave&nbsp;way. Cinna was acknowledged as consul, the sentence of outlawry passed on Marius was revoked and Cinna and Marius&nbsp;entered Rome with their troops. Marius’s thirst for revenge&nbsp;was gratified by a frightful massacre, and he lived long enough&nbsp;to be nominated consul for the seventh time. But he held his&nbsp;consulship only a few weeks. Early in 86 lie died, and&nbsp;for the next three years Cinna ruled Rome. Constitutional government was virtually suspended. For 8 5 and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">84 Cinna nominated himself and a trusted colleague as consuls.@@<sup>3 </sup>The state was, as Cicero@@<sup>4</sup> says, without lawful authority.@@<sup>5 </sup>One&nbsp;important matter was carried through—the registration in all&nbsp;the tribes of the newly enfranchised Italians,@@<sup>6</sup> but beyond this&nbsp;little was done. The attention of Cinna and his friends was in&nbsp;truth engrossed by the ever-present dread of Sulla’s return&nbsp;from Asia. The consul of 86, L. Valerius Flaccus (who&nbsp;had been consul with Marius in 100 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.),</span><span class="font1"> sent out to&nbsp;supersede him, was murdered by his own soldiers at Nicomedia@@.<sup>7</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 85 Sulla, though disowned by his government, concluded a peace with Mithradates.@@<sup>8</sup> In 84, after settling affairs in Asia and crushing Flaccus’s successor, C. Flavius&nbsp;Fimbria, he crossed into Greece, and in the spring of&nbsp;83 landed at Brundusium with 40,000 soldiers and a&nbsp;large following of ¿migré nobles. Cinna was dead,@@<sup>9&nbsp;</sup>murdered like Flaccus by his mutinous soldiers; his&nbsp;most trusted colleague, Cn. Papirius Carbo, was commanding&nbsp;as proconsul in Cisalpine Gaul; and the resistance offered to</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sulla’s advance was slight. At Capua, Sulla routed the forces of one consul, Gaius Norbanus; at Teanum the troops of the&nbsp;other went over in a body to the side of the outlawed proconsul.&nbsp;After a winter spent in Campania he pressed forward to Rome,&nbsp;defeated the younger Marius (consul,82) near Praeneste,&nbsp;and entered the city without further opposition. In&nbsp;north Italy the success of his Ueutenants,Q.Caecilius Metellus Pius</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(son of Metellus Numidicus), Cn. Pompeius and Marcus Crassus, had been fully as decisive. Cisalpine Gaul, Umbria and Etruria&nbsp;had all been won for Sulla, and the two principal leaders on the&nbsp;other side, Carbo and Norbanus, ,had each fled, one to Rhodes,&nbsp;the other to Africa. Only one foe remained to be conquered.&nbsp;The Samnites and Lucanians whom Cinna had conciliated, and&nbsp;who saw in Sulla their bitterest foe, were for the last time in&nbsp;arms, and had already joined forces with the remains of&nbsp;the Marian army close to Rome. The decisive battle was&nbsp;fought under the walls of the city, and ended in the complete&nbsp;defeat of the Marians and Italians (battle of the Colline Gate).@@<sup>10</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For a period of nearly ten years Rome and Italy had been distracted by civil war. Sulla was now called upon to heal</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">the divisions which rent the state asunder, to set in working again the machinery of civil government and above&nbsp;all so to modify it as to meet the altered conditions,&nbsp;and to fortify it against the dangers which visibly&nbsp;threatened it in the future. The real charge against&nbsp;Sulla@@<sup>11</sup> is not that he failed to accomplish all this, for to do so&nbsp;was beyond the powers even of a man so able, resolute and&nbsp;self-confident as Sulla, armed though he was with absolute&nbsp;authority and backed by overwhelming military strength and&nbsp;the prestige of unbroken success. He stands convicted rather&nbsp;of deliberately aggravating some and culpably ignoring others&nbsp;of the evils he should have tried to cure, and of contenting&nbsp;himself with a party triumph when he should have aimed at&nbsp;the regeneration and confirmation of the whole state. His&nbsp;victory was instantly followed, not by any measures of conciliation, but by a series of massacres, proscriptions and confiscations, of which almost the least serious consequence was the&nbsp;immediate loss of life which they entailed.@@<sup>12</sup> From this time&nbsp;forward the fear of proscription and confiscation&nbsp;recurred as a possible consequence of every political&nbsp;crisis, and it was with difficulty that Caesar himself&nbsp;dissipated the belief that his victory would be followed&nbsp;by a Sullan reign of terror. The legacy of hatred and&nbsp;discontent which Sulla left behind him was a constant source&nbsp;of disquiet and danger. In the children of the proscribed,&nbsp;whom he excluded from holding office, and the dispossessed&nbsp;owners of the confiscated lands, every agitator found ready and&nbsp;willing allies.@@<sup>13</sup> The moneyed men of the equestrian order&nbsp;were more than ever hostile to the senatorial government,&nbsp;which they now identified with the man who cherished towards&nbsp;them a peculiar hatred,@@<sup>14</sup> and whose creatures had hunted them&nbsp;down like dogs. The attachment which the new Italian citizens&nbsp;might in time have learnt to feel for the old republican constitution was nipped in the bud by the massacres at Praeneste&nbsp;and Norba, by the harsh treatment of the ancient towns of&nbsp;Etruria, and by the ruthless desolation of Samnium and&nbsp;Lucania.@@<sup>15</sup> Quite as fatal were the results to the economic&nbsp;prosperity of the peninsula. Sulla’s confiscations, following&nbsp;on the civil and social wars, opened the doors wide for&nbsp;a long train of evils. The veterans whom he planted on the&nbsp;lands he had seized@@<sup>16</sup> did nothing for agriculture, and swelled&nbsp;the growing numbers of the turbulent and discontented.@@<sup>17</sup> The&nbsp;“ Sullan men ” became as great an object of fear and dislike as&nbsp;the “Sullan reign?’@@<sup>18</sup> The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">latijundia</span><span class="font1"> increased with startling&nbsp;rapidity—whole territories passing into the hands of greedy&nbsp;partisans.@@<sup>19</sup> Wide tracts of land, confiscated but never allotted,&nbsp;ran to waste.@@<sup>20</sup> In all but a few districts of Italy the fiee population finally and completely disappeared from the open country;&nbsp;and life and property were rendered insecure by the brigandage&nbsp;which now developed unchecked, and in which the herdsmen&nbsp;slaves played a prominent part. The outbreaks of Spartacus in&nbsp;73, and of Catiline ten years later, were significant&nbsp;commentaries on this part of Sulla’s work.@@<sup>21</sup> His constitutional legislation, while it included many useful&nbsp;administrative reforms, is marked by as violent a&nbsp;spirit of partisanship, and as apparently wilful a&nbsp;blindness to the future.
