or <hi rend="smallcaps">Shur</hi> (anc. geog.), a deſert of Arabia Petræa, extending between Paleſtine and the Arabian Gulph ; into which the Iſraelites, after marching through the Red Sea, firſt came (Exod. xv. 22.) Again (Numb, xxxiii. 8.), it is ſaid, that from the ſea they went three days journey into the Wilderneſs of Etham ; whence ſome conclude that Etham and Shur are the ſame wilderneſs ; or only differ as a part from the whole, Shur being the general name, and Etham that part of it lying neareſt to the place of encampment of the ſame name. We know ſo little of the geography of theſe places that there is more room ſor deputation than for deciſion. As to the route which the Iſraelites followed in their passage through the Red Sea, Mr Bryant, we think, has given the moſt ſatisfactory account in his late work on the Plagues of Egypt.—Shur is now called <hi rend="italic">Co'ondel.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
