<p><span class="font3">great rarity and value, while the latter is an aluminate of magnesium, inferior to the true ruby in hardness and&nbsp;much less esteemed as a gem stone. With ancient writers&nbsp;the confusion was even greater, for they appear to have&nbsp;classed together under a common name, such as the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">car-bunxulus</span><span class="font3"> of Pliny or the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">άνθραξ</span><span class="font3"> of Greek writers, not only&nbsp;our two kinds of ruby but also garnets and other inferior&nbsp;stones of a brilliant fiery colour. By modern mineralogists it has come to be understood that when the word&nbsp;ruby is used without any qualifying prefix the true or&nbsp;Oriental stone is invariably indicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Oriental ruby, like all other varieties of corundum, crystallizes in the rhombohedral system; but, as it usually&nbsp;occurs as small pebbles or rounded fragments, the crystalline form can rarely be traced. Its colour varies from&nbsp;deep cochineal to pale rose red, in some cases inclining to&nbsp;purple, the most valued tint being that known to experts&nbsp;as pigeon’s blood colour. On exposure to a high temperature the ruby becomes green, but regains its original colour&nbsp;on cooling—a behaviour which is consistent with the supposition that the stone owes its colour to the presence of&nbsp;oxide of chromium, and indeed in artificial rubies the&nbsp;required tint is always obtained by the use of some compound of chromium. When a ruby of the most esteemed&nbsp;colour is properly viewed through a dichroiscope, the&nbsp;colour is resolved into a carmine and an aurora red, or red&nbsp;inclining to orange. By this test the true ruby may be&nbsp;distinguished from spinel and garnet, since these minerals&nbsp;crystallize in the cubic system and therefore are not di-chroic. Another mode of distinction is suggested by the&nbsp;high density of corundum : the specific gravity of the true&nbsp;ruby reaches or even rises slightly above 4, and thus&nbsp;greatly exceeds that of either spinel or garnet. But&nbsp;perhaps the simplest test is afforded by its great hardness (H = 9): the sharp edge of a corundum crystal will&nbsp;readily scratch either a spinel or a garnet, but has no&nbsp;effect on a ruby. The true ruby has a very high index&nbsp;of refraction </span><span class="font0">(∕z,= </span><span class="font3">l<sup>-</sup>78), and to this character is due&nbsp;the remarkable lustre of the polished stone. Mr Crookes&nbsp;has shown that the ruby is brilliantly phosphorescent&nbsp;when subjected to radiant discharge in a properly exhausted vessel, and curiously enough the red light emitted&nbsp;is equally vivid whatever be the colour of the corundum&nbsp;under experiment. The microscopic structure of the&nbsp;ruby has been studied by Mr Sorby, who finds that the&nbsp;stone contains fluid cavities and numerous crystallized&nbsp;enclosures of other minerals </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(P roc. Roy. Soc.,</span><span class="font3"> χvii.. 1869,&nbsp;p. 291).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Oriental ruby is a mineral of very limited distribution, its principal localities being confined to the kingdom of Burmah. The&nbsp;most ιmporUnt ruby mines are situated at Kyat Pyen, about 70&nbsp;miles to the north-east of Mandalay ; there are also mines at&nbsp;' Mookop, a little farther north, and others in the Sagyin Hills,&nbsp;within 16 miles of Mandalay. In all these localities the rubies&nbsp;occur in association with sapphires and other precious stones,&nbsp;forming a gem-bearing gravel which is dug up and washed in very&nbsp;primitive fashion. By far the larger number of the rubies are of&nbsp;small size, and the larger stones are generally flawed. All rubies&nbsp;exceeding a certain weight were the property of the king of Burmah.&nbsp;The mines were jealously watched, and it was difficult for Europeans&nbsp;to obtain access to them ; but some of the Ava workings were&nbsp;visited and described many years ago by Père Giuseppe d<sup>i</sup>Amato,&nbsp;and more recently those near Mandalay have been described by Mr&nbsp;Bredmeyer, who was officially connected with them (Ball). It is&nbsp;βUted in the older works on mineralogy that rubies occur in the&nbsp;Capelan Mountains near Syrian, in Pegu. In peninsular India&nbsp;there are but few localities that yield rubies, but they have been&nbsp;reported from the corundum mines of the Salem district in Madras&nbsp;and from Mysore. In Ceylon they occur with sapphires, but are&nbsp;rarer than those gems, and the Ceylon rubies are not usually of&nbsp;good colour. Rubies have been brought from Gandamak, in&nbsp;Afghanistan, but most of the stones reputed to be Afghan rubies</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">are merely spinels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1871 some remarkable deposits of corundum were discovered by Col. C. W. Jenks in Macon co., North Carolina. Rubies,&nbsp;sapphires, and large pebbles of coarse corundum were found in thθ&nbsp;bed of a river near a large mass of serpentine which afterwards&nbsp;became known as Corundum Hill, and these pebbles were&nbsp;eventually traced to certain veins in the serpentine. The corundum&nbsp;occurred crystallized </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in situ,</span><span class="font2"> but was rarely of such a colour as&nbsp;would entitle it to be called ruby. Mr G. F. Kunz, who has&nbsp;lately written an article on American precious stones, states that&nbsp;rubies and sapphires have also been found at Vernon, New Jersey ;&nbsp;near Helena, Montana ; at Santa Fe, New Mexico ; in southern&nbsp;Colorado ; and in Arizona.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Australia has occasionally yielded true rubies, but mostly of small size and inferior quality. In Victoria they have been found&nbsp;in the drifts of the Beechworth gold fields and at the Berwick tin&nbsp;mine, Wallace’s Creek ; while in New South Wales they occur at&nbsp;Mudgee, in the Cudgegong and some of its tributaries, and at&nbsp;Tumberumba, co. Wynyard. A magenta-coloured turbid ruby&nbsp;from Victoria is known under the name of “ barklyite.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The “star ruby” is a rather cloudy variety from Ceylon, exhibiting when cut </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">en cabochon</span><span class="font2"> a luminous star of six rays, reflected from the convex surface of the stone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The largest ruby known in Europe is said to be one of the size of a small hen’s egg, which was presented by Gustavus III. of&nbsp;Sweden to the empress of Russia on the occasion of his visit to St&nbsp;Petersburg. Rubies of larger size have been described by&nbsp;Tavernier and other Oriental travellers, but it is probable that in&nbsp;many cases spinels have been mistaken for true rubies. There&nbsp;seems no doubt that the great historic ruby set in the Maltese&nbsp;cross in front of the imperial state crown of England is a spinel.&nbsp;This stone was given to Edward the Black Prince by Pedro the&nbsp;Cruel, king of Castile, on the victory of Najera' in 1367, and it was&nbsp;afterwards worn by Henry V. at the battle of Agincourt, when it&nbsp;narrowly escaped destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The spinel ruby has been described in the article Mineralogy (vol. xvi. p. 386, sp. 93). The spinels used for jewellery are mostly&nbsp;obtained in Burmah, where they occur as octahedral crystals or as&nbsp;water-worn pebbles in association with the true ruby, for which&nbsp;they are often mistaken. They are also found in the gem-bearing&nbsp;gravels of Ceylon, Victoria, and New South Wales. The delicate&nbsp;rose-pink variety known as balas ruby was worked for centuries in&nbsp;Badakhshan, but the operations appear to have been suspended of&nbsp;late years. The mines are situated on the river Shighnan, a&nbsp;tributary of the Oxus. It is commonly said that the name&nbsp;“balas ” or “ balash ” is a corruption of Badakhshan, while others&nbsp;derive it from Balkh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Oriental ruby has always been esteemed of far higher value than any other precious stone. A ruby of perfect colour, weighing&nbsp;five carats, is worth at the present day ten times as much as a&nbsp;diamond of equal weight (Streeter). As the weight of the stone&nbsp;increases, its value rapidly rises, so that rubies of exceptional size&nbsp;command enormous prices. There is consequently much temptation to replace the true stone by spinel or garnet or even paste.&nbsp;By means of oxide of chromium an excellent imitation of the colour&nbsp;of the ruby is obtained ; and, though the ordinary “strass,” or fine&nbsp;lead-glass, is very soft, and therefore soon loses its lustre, it is yet&nbsp;possible to produce a paste consisting of silicate of alumina which&nbsp;is almost as hard as rock crystal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is an interesting fact that the chemist has frequently succeeded in causing alumina to assume artificially many of the physical Characteristicsof the native ruby. As far back as 1837&nbsp;M. Gaudin reproduced the ruby on a small scale by exposing&nbsp;ammonia-alum to the heat of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe, whereby&nbsp;he obtained fused alumina which was readily coloured by the&nbsp;addition of oxide of chromium. A different method was followed&nbsp;by Ebelmen. He dissolved alumina in boric acid at a high&nbsp;temperature, and on the cooling of the mass obtained the alumina&nbsp;in a crystallized form ; while if chromate of ammonium was&nbsp;present the crystals became veritable ruby. MM. Sainte-Claire&nbsp;Deville and Caron heated a mixture of fluoride of aluminium,&nbsp;fluoride of chromium, and boric acid, and thus obtained a fluoride&nbsp;of boron, which, being volatile, readily escaped, and left a solid&nbsp;residue of alumina coloured by the chrome. These, however, were&nbsp;only laboratory experiments, and it was reserved for MM. Frémy&nbsp;and Feil, in 1878, to reproduce the ruby and sapphire on a scale suggestive of some commercial importance. By heating a mixture of&nbsp;artificial alumina and red lead in a fireclay crucible, they obtained a&nbsp;vitreous silicate of lead (the silica being derived from the crucible)&nbsp;and crystallized alumina, while the addition of bichromate of potassium caused this alumina to assume the coveted tint of the ruby.</span></p>
