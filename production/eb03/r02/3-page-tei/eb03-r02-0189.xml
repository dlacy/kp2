This general, incited by many of the principal men of Rome, openly rebelled againſt him, and aſſumed the title of <hi rend="italic">emperor.</hi>  Nothing could exceed the terrors of Claudius, upon being informed of this revolt : his nature and his crimes had diſpoſed him to be more cowardly than the reſt of mankind ; ſo that when Camillus commanded him by letters to relinquiſh the empire, and retire to a private ſtation, he ſeemed inclined to obey. However, his fears upon this occaſion were ſoon removed : for the legions which had declared for Camillus being terrified by ſome prodigies, ſhortly after abandoned him ; ſo that the man whom but five days before they bad acknowledged as emperor, they now thought it no infamy to deſtroy. The cruelty of Meſſalina and her minions upon this occaſion ſeemed to have no bounds. They ſo wrought upon the emperor’s fears and ſuſpicions, that numbers were executed without trial or proof; and ſcarce any, even of thoſe who were but ſuſpected, eſeaped, unleſs by ranſoming their lives with their fortunes.</p><p>By ſuch cruelfie9 as theſe, the favourites of the emperor endeavoured to eſtabliſh his and their own authority : but in order to increaſe the neceſſity of their aſſiſtance, they laboured to augment the greatneſs of his terrors. He now became a prey to jealouſy and diſ-quietude. Being one day in the temple, and finding a ſword that was left there by accident, he convened the ſenate in a fright, and informed them of his danger. After this he never ventured to go to any feaſt without being ſurrounded by his guards, nor would he ſuffer any man to approach him without a previous ſearch. Thus wholly employed by hist anxiety for ſelf-preſervation, he entirely left the care of the ſtate to his favourites, who by degrees gave him a reliſh ſor daughter. From this time he ſeemed delighted with inflicting tortures ; and on a certain occaſion continued ä whole day at the city Tibur, waiting for an hangman from Rome, that he might feaſt his eyes with an execution in the manner of the ancients. Nor was he leſs regardleſs of the perſons he condemned, than cruel in the infliction of their puniſhment. Such was his extreme ſtupidſty, that he would frequently invite thoſe to ſupper whom he had put to death but the day before ; and often denied the having given orders for an execution, but a few hours after pronouncing ſentence. Suetonius aſſures us, that there were no leſs than 35 ſenators, and above 300 knights, executed in his reign ; and that ſuch was hie unconcern in the midſt of ſlaughter, that one of the tribunes bringing him an account of a certain ſenator who was executed, he quite forgot his offence, but calmly acquieſced in his puniſhment.</p><p>In this manner was Claudius urged on by Meſſalina to commit cruelties, which he conſidered only as wholeſome ſeverities ; while, in the mean time, ſhe put no bounds to her enormities. The impunity of her paſt vices only increaſing her confidence to commit new, her debaucheries became every day more notorious, and her lewdneſs exceeded what had ever been ſeen at Rome. She cauſed ſome women of the firſt quality to commit adultery in the pr eſence of their huſhands, and deſtroyed ſuch as refuſed to comply. After appearing for</p><p>ſome years inſatiable in her deſires, ſhe at length fixed her affections upon Caius Silius, the moſt beautiful youth in Rome. Her love for the young Roman ſeemed to amount even to madneſs. She obliged him to divorce his wiſe Junia Syllana, that ſhe might entirely poſſeſs him herſelf. She obliged him to accept of immenſe treaſures and valuable preſents ; cohabiting with him in the moſt open manner, and treating hi n with the moſt ſhameleſs familiarity. The very imperial ornaments were transferred to his houſe ; and the emperor’s ſlaves and attendants had orders to wait upon the adulterer. Nothing was wanting to complete the inſolence of their conduct, but their being married together ; and this was ſoon after effected. They relied upon the emperor’s imbecility for their ſecurity, and only waited till he retired to Oſtia to put their ill-judged project in execution. In his abſence, they celebrated their nuptials with all the ceremonies and ſplendor which attend the moſt confident ſecurity. Meſſalina gave a looſe to her paſſion, and appeared as a Bacchanalian with a thyrſus in her hand ; while Silius aſſumed the character of Bacchus, his body being adorned with robes imitating ivy, and his legs covered with buſhins. A troop of fingers and dancers attend, ed, who heightened thg revel with the moſt laſcivious ſongs and the moſt indecent attitudes. In the midſt of this riot, one Valens, a buffoon, is ſaid to have climbed a tree ; and being demanded what he ſaw, anſwered that he perceived a dreadſul ſtorm coming from Oſtia. What this fellow ſpoke at random was actually at that time in preparation. It ſeems that ſome time before there had been a quarrel between Meſſalina and Narciſſus, the emperor’s firſt freedman. This ſubtle miniſter therefore deſired nothing more than an opportunity of ruining the empreſs, and he judged this to be a moſt favourable occaſion. He firſt made the diſcovery by means of two concubines who attended the emperor, who were inſtructed to inform him of Meſſa-lina’s marriage as the news of the day, while Narciſſus himſelf ſtepped in to confirm their information. Finding it operated upon the emperor’s fears as he could wiſh, he reſolved to alarm him ſtill more by a diſcovery of all Meſſalina’s projects and attempts. He aggravated the danger, and urged the expediency of ſpeed sly puniſlimg the delinquents. Claudius, quite terrified at ſo unexpected a relation, ſuppoſed the enemy were already at his gates ; and frequently interrupted his freedman, by aſking if he was ſtill maſter of the empire. Being aſſured that he yet had it in his power to continue ſo, he reſolved to go and puniſh the affront offered to his dignity without delay. Nothing could exceed the conſternation of Meſſalina and her thought-leſs companions, upon being informed that the emperor was coming to diſturb tſheir feſtivity. Every one retired in the utmoſt confuſion. Silius was taken. Meſſalina took ſhelter in ſome gardens which ſhe had lately ſeized upon, having expelled Aſiaticus the true owner, and put him to death. From thence ſhe ſent Britannicus, her only ſon by the emperor, with Octavia her daughter, to intercede for her, and implore his mercy. She ſoon after followed them herſelf ; but Narciſſus had ſo fortified the emperor againſt her arts, and contrived ſuch methods of diverting his attention from her defence, that ſhe was obliged to return in deſpair. Narciſſus being thus far ſucceſsſul, led Claudius</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
