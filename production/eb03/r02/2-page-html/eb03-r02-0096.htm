<p><span class="font1">ROCKET, an artificial fire-work, conſiſting of a cylindrical caſe of paper, filled with a compoſition of&nbsp;certain combuſtible ingredients ; which, being tied to&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font1">ſtick, mounts into the air, and then burſts. See Py-</span><span class="font0">ROTECHNY.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Theory of the Flight of Sky-Rocκκτs.</span><span class="font1"> Mariotte takes the riſe of rockets to be owing to the impulſe or reſiſtance of the air againſt the ffame. Dr Delagulier accounts for it otherwiſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Conceive the rocket to have no vent at the choak, and to be ſet on fire in the conical bore ; the conſequence will be, either that the rocket would burſt in the&nbsp;weakeft place, or, if all its parts were equally ſtrong,&nbsp;and able to ſuſtain the impulſe of the flame, the rocket&nbsp;would burn out immoveable. Now, as the force of&nbsp;the flame is equable, ſuppoſe its action downwards, or&nbsp;that upwards, ſufficient to lift 40 pounds. As theſe&nbsp;forces are equal, but their directions contrary, they&nbsp;will deſtroy each other’s action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Imagine then the rocket opened at the choak ; by this means the action of the flame downwards is taken&nbsp;away, and there remains a force equal to 40 pounds&nbsp;acting upwards, to carry up the rocket, and the ſtick&nbsp;it is tied to. Accordingly, we find that if the com-poſition of the rocket be very weak, ſo as not to give&nbsp;an impulſe greater than the weight of the rocket and&nbsp;ftick, it does not riſe at all ; or if the compoſition be&nbsp;flow, ſo that a ſmall part of it only kindles at firſt, the&nbsp;rocket will not riſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The ſtick ſerves to keep it perpendicular ; for if the τocket ſhould begin to ſtumble, moving round a point&nbsp;in the choak, as being the common centre of gravity of&nbsp;rocket and ſtick, there would be ſo much friction&nbsp;againſt tire air by the ſtick between the centre and&nbsp;the point, and the point would beat againſt the air&nbsp;with ſo much velocity, that the friction of the medium&nbsp;would reſtore it to its perpendicularity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When the compoſition is burnt out, and the impulſe upwards is ceaſed, the common centre of gravity is</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">brought lower towards the middle </span><span class="font2">of </span><span class="font1">the ſtick ; by which means the velocity of the point of the ſtick is&nbsp;decreaſed, and that of the point of the rocket increaſed ; ſo that the whole will tumble down, with the&nbsp;rocket-end foremoſt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All the while the rocket burns, the common centre of gravity is ſhifting and getting downwards, and ſtill&nbsp;the faſter and the lower as the ſtick is the lighter, ſo&nbsp;that it ſometimes begins to tumble before it be burnt&nbsp;out ; but when the ſtick is a little too heavy, the&nbsp;weight of the rocket bearing a leſs proportion to that&nbsp;of the ſtick, the common centre of gravity will not get&nbsp;ſo low but that the rocket will riſe ſtraight, though not&nbsp;ſo faſt.</span></p>
