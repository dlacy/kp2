(Samuel), curate of Shelthon in Norfolk, prebendary of Canterbury, and chaplain in ordinary to the king, was a learned Engliſhman. His manners were thoſe of a philoſopher, uncorrupted by the manners of the world. He wrote a hiſtory of the world, ſacred and profane, to ſerve as an introduction to Prideaux, in 3 vols 8vo. It is heavily written, but diſplays a great deal of erudition. His death, which happened in 1756, prevented him from carrying it down to the year 747 before Chriſt, where Prideaux begins. He wrote alſo a treatiſe on the Creation and Fall of Man, to ſerve as a ſupplement to the preface to his hiſtory.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
