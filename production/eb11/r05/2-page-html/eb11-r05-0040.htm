<p><span class="font0">of composition or by condensation with the elimination of the elements of water. The effect of chemical agents in producing&nbsp;coagulation are in consonance with what is known of other&nbsp;instances of polymeric or condensation changes, whilst the fact&nbsp;that the collection of globules separated by creaming after&nbsp;thorough washing, and therefore removal of all proteid, is&nbsp;susceptible of solidification into caoutchouc by a merely&nbsp;mechanical act such as churning, strongly supports the view&nbsp;that the character of the change is distinct from that of any&nbsp;alteration which may occur in the proteid constituents of&nbsp;the latex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The existence of caoutchouc or rubber was first observed soon after the discovery of America. It was noticed that&nbsp;certain Indian tribes of South America played with a ball&nbsp;composed of a resilient and elastic substance, which afterwards&nbsp;was found to possess the power of removing lead pencil marks&nbsp;from paper and came into commerce as “ Indian Rubber.”&nbsp;It was not until the middle of the 18th century that the trees&nbsp;which yielded caoutchouc were identified, chiefly by French&nbsp;observers. La Condamine ascertained the nature of the tree,&nbsp;now known as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hevea brasiliensis,</span><span class="font0"> from which the Para rubber&nbsp;of S. America was obtained, whilst a little later Frcsnau and&nbsp;Aublet described the Euphorbiaceous trees which furnished the&nbsp;rubber of Guiana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The methods adopted by the natives in S. America and in Mexico for incising-the trees and obtaining the rubber are&nbsp;exceedingly primitive, but survive with little modification at&nbsp;the present day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Statistics of Rubber Production,—</span><span class="font0">Until recently rubber was obtained almost exclusively from the tropical forests of S.&nbsp;and Central America, E. and W. Africa and Asia, being the&nbsp;produce of naturally occurring trees and vines. The increase&nbsp;in the demand, for which the employment of rubber tires is&nbsp;largely responsible, has given an increased stimulus to the&nbsp;production of “ wild ” rubber, with the result that trees and&nbsp;vines have been recklessly cut and destroyed, and in some&nbsp;instances vast regions, as in the S. Sudan, have been nearly&nbsp;entirely denuded of rubber vines. This has led to restrictive&nbsp;measures, the vines being tapped under definite regulations&nbsp;as to the manner and time of tapping, and also to requirements&nbsp;as to replanting vines to take the place of those which have&nbsp;been injured or destroyed, certain areas being periodically&nbsp;closed. Such measures, which are now in operation in the&nbsp;French Sudan, the Congo and in German W. and E. Africa,&nbsp;can, however, only be enforced by special administrative&nbsp;machinery and at considerable expense, and this legislative&nbsp;action can only be regarded as temporary and preliminary&nbsp;to the establishment of plantations of rubber trees, which are&nbsp;not only easier to control, but the trees are less liable to injury&nbsp;from careless tapping. In Africa it seems probable that the&nbsp;production of rubber from vines is likely to be entirely superseded in process of time, and replaced by the plantations of&nbsp;trees which are already being established in those districts in&nbsp;which careful experiment has determined the kind of rubber&nbsp;tree best adapted to the locality. The forests of tropical&nbsp;America have suffered similarly, trees having been injured or&nbsp;destroyed and in some cases cut down in order to secure the&nbsp;immediate increase of supply which was called for by a considerable rise in value. The result has been that in the forests&nbsp;of Brazil and Mexico the conservation of rubber trees has&nbsp;received greater attention, whilst new and extensive areas&nbsp;are planted in S. and Central America. The wild rubber of S.&nbsp;and Central America is still the principal source of the rubber&nbsp;supply of the world, and is likely to continue to be so for many&nbsp;years to come. Although the cost of transport from the remote&nbsp;forest regions of some districts is a serious consideration, this&nbsp;is not likely to be operative in reducing production until there&nbsp;has been a considerable and permanent fall in price, by which&nbsp;time new areas in those countries in which planting is now&nbsp;taking place will probably have come into bearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The enormous increase in the commercial demand for rubber and the probability of the continuance of this increase in view&nbsp;of the great variety of purposes to which the material can be&nbsp;applied, has led to great activity in rubber planting in other&nbsp;parts of the world, especially in Ceylon and the Malay Peninsula&nbsp;and Archipelago, where the Para rubber trees </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Hevea brasiliensis}&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">has been successfully introduced, and numerous plantations,&nbsp;many of which have not been in existence for more than ten or&nbsp;fifteen years, are now contributing to the world’s supply. This&nbsp;rubber is known as “ Plantation ” rubber in contradistinction&nbsp;to the “ wild ” rubber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Plantation ” Para rubber from Ceylon and the Malay States has brought prices equal to and often exceeding those&nbsp;of fine Para rubber from Brazil. This is largely due to the&nbsp;improved methods of preparing the rubber practised by the&nbsp;planters of Ceylon and Malaya, which lead to the exclusion&nbsp;of the impurities usually found in “ wild ” rubber. Para&nbsp;rubber from Brazil generally contains about 15% of water,&nbsp;whilst “ plantation ” Para is usually nearly dry and contains 1 %&nbsp;of water or less. It would appear, however, that the finest&nbsp;“ wild ” Para rubber as a rule possesses greater tensile strength&nbsp;than the “ plantation ” rubber. This has been ascribed by&nbsp;some to the presence in “ wild ” rubber of certain impurities&nbsp;derived either from the latex or introduced during the preparation of the rubber which are thought to enhance the physical&nbsp;properties of the caoutchouc. It is more probable, however,&nbsp;that the superiority of the “ wild ” Para is principally due to the&nbsp;greater age of the forest trees from which the rubber is obtained,&nbsp;many of which are from thirty to fifty years old. It is well&nbsp;known that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hevea</span><span class="font0"> tree usually furnishes very inferior rubber&nbsp;if tapped before it is six or seven years old, and there is evidence&nbsp;to show that the quality of the rubber improves with the age&nbsp;of the tree. The oldest of the plantation trees of Ceylon and&nbsp;Malaya are not much more than twelve years old, whilst it is to&nbsp;be feared that immature trees are often tapped and their latex&nbsp;mixed with that of older trees before coagulation, thus forming&nbsp;inferior rubber. It is therefore to be expected that as time&nbsp;goes on the quality of “ plantation ” rubber will improve, and&nbsp;there would seem to be no reason why it should not eventually&nbsp;be fully equal to that of the “ wild ” rubber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1909 the total production of rubber is stated to have been about 70,000 tons, of which more than one-half came&nbsp;from tropical America; about one-third from Africa, w<sup>T</sup>bilst&nbsp;the remainder was chiefly of Asiatic origin, including “ plantation ” rubber from Ceylon and Malaya, which amounted to&nbsp;about 3000 tons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Chiefly owing to the supplies of “ wild ” rubber which are still available, comparatively little has been done until recently&nbsp;in establishing plantations either in Africa or in tropical America,&nbsp;but in Asia, including Ceylon, India and Malaya, in which&nbsp;there are relatively few important naturally-occurring rubber&nbsp;plants, there has been for some years great activity in forming&nbsp;plantations of rubber trees introduced mainly from tropical&nbsp;America, and there are now many millions sterling of British&nbsp;capital invested in companies established to form rubber&nbsp;plantations chiefly in Ceylon and Malaya. Each year should&nbsp;therefore show an increase in the production of plantation&nbsp;rubber. No trustworthy estimate of the rate of the increase&nbsp;of production can, however, be formed, as several uncertain&nbsp;economic factors have to be taken into account. Among&nbsp;these are the precise extent of demand, the limit of the inevitable fall in price with largely increased production, the cost&nbsp;of labour as increasing amounts are required, and the effect of&nbsp;changed conditions on the output of “ wild ” rubber and the&nbsp;competition of the new plantations which are being established&nbsp;in tropical America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There can be little doubt that with a fall in price further uses for rubber wou|d arise, leading to an increased demand,&nbsp;and among them may be mentioned its utilization as a road&nbsp;material. Difficulties in the supply of labour in the East&nbsp;may hinder the further development of the rubber-planting&nbsp;industry, especially at a period when a reduction in the cost&nbsp;of production may be the chief problem. In 1909 the average&nbsp;cost of producing “ plantation ” rubber in Ceylon and Malaya</span></p>
