<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ſpect can be </span><span class="font1">obſerved in the actions of air and water ; and this had always appeared a great defect in Newton’s&nbsp;theory : but it was only a defect of the theory attributed&nbsp;to him. But it is alſo true, that the obſerved action is&nbsp;but one-half of what is juft now deduced ſrom this improved view of the ſubject. whence arifes this difference ? The reafon is this : we have given a very erroneous account of the motions of the filaments. A filament Έ F does not move as repreſented in ſig. 6. with&nbsp;two rectangular inflexions at I and at H, and a path&nbsp;IH between them parallel to C B. The proceſs of na-ture is more like what is repreſented in ſig. io. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">It is&nbsp;obfirved,</span><span class="font1"> that at the anterior part of the body A B, there&nbsp;remains a quantity of fluid AD B, almoft, if not alto-gether, ftagnant, of a ſingular ſhape, having two curved&nbsp;concave ſides A </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> D, B </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font1"> D, along which the middle&nbsp;filaments glide. This fluid is very {lowly changed.—&nbsp;The late Sir Charles Knowles, an officer of the Britiſh&nbsp;navy, equally eminent for his fcientiſic profeſſional&nbsp;knowledge and for his military talents, made many&nbsp;beautiful experiments for aſceitaining the paths of the&nbsp;filaments of water. At a diftance up the ftream, he&nbsp;allowed ſmall jets of à coloured ſiuid, which did not&nbsp;mix with water, to make part of the ftream ; and the&nbsp;experiments were made in troughs with ſides and bottom&nbsp;of plate-glaſs. A ſmall taper was placed at a conſider-able height above, by which the ſhadows of the colour-ed filaments were moft diſtinctly projected on a white&nbsp;plane held below the trough, fo that they were accu-rately drawn with a pencil. A few important parti-eulars may be here mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The ftill water ADC lafted for a long while be-fore it was renewed ; and it ſeemed to be gradually wafted by abraſion, by the adheſion of the ſurrounding&nbsp;water, which gradually licked away the outer parts&nbsp;from D to A and B ; and it ſeemed to renew itſelf in&nbsp;the direction CD, oppoſite to the motion of the ftream.&nbsp;There was, however, a conſiderable intricacy and eddy&nbsp;in this motion. Some (ſeemingly ſuperſicial) water&nbsp;was continually, but ſiowly, flowing outward from the&nbsp;line DC, while other water was feen within and below&nbsp;it, coming inwards and going backwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The coloured lateral filaments were moft conftant in their form, while the body was the fame, although the ve-locity was in idrne caſes quadrupled. Any change which&nbsp;this produced ſeemed confined to the ſuperſicial filaments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As the filaments were deflected, they were alſo con-ftipated, that is, the curved parts of the filaments were nearer each other than the parallel ftraight filaments up&nbsp;the ftream ; and this conftipation was more conſiderable&nbsp;as the. prow was more obtuſe and the deflexion greater.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The inner filaments were ultimately more deflected than thoſe without them.; that is, if a line be drawn&nbsp;touching the curve EFIH in the point H of contrary&nbsp;flexure, wherc the concavity begins to be on the ſide&nbsp;next the body, the angle HKC, contained between&nbsp;the axis and this tangent line, is ſo much the greater as&nbsp;the filament is nearer the axis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">when the body expofed to the ftream was a box of upright ſides, flat bottom, and angular prow, like a&nbsp;wedge, having its edge alfo upright, the filaments were&nbsp;not all deflected laterally, as theory would make us expect ; but the filaments near the bottom were alſo deflected downwards as well as laterally, and glided alon^</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">at ſome diftance under the bottom, forming lines of double curvature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1 he breadth of the ftream that was deflected was much greater than that of the body ; and the ſenſible&nbsp;deflection begun at a conſiderable diftance up the ftream,&nbsp;eſpecially in the outer filaments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Laſily, the form of the curves was greatly influenced by the proportion between the width of the trough and&nbsp;that of the body. The curvature was always leſs when&nbsp;the trough was very wide in proportion to the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Great varieties were alſo obferved in the motion or velocity of the filaments. In general, the filaments&nbsp;increaſed in velocity outwards from the body to a certain ſmall diftance, which was nearly the ſame in all&nbsp;caſes, and then diminiſhed all the way outward. This&nbsp;was obferved by inequalities in the colour of the filaments, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hγ</span><span class="font1"> which one could be obſerved to outftrip an-other. I he retardation of thoſe next the body ſeemed to&nbsp;proceed from friction; and it was imagined that without&nbsp;this the velocity there would always have been greateft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I heſe obſervations give us conſiderable information reſpectſhg the mechaniſm of theſe motions, and the action of fluids upon ſolids. The preffure in the duplicate&nbsp;ratio of the velocities comes here agqin into view, we&nbsp;found, that although the velocities were very different,&nbsp;the curves were preciſely the ſame. Now the obferved&nbsp;preffures arife from the tranſverſe forces by which each&nbsp;particle of a filament is retained in its curvilineal path ;&nbsp;and we know that the force by which a body is retain-ed in any curve is directly as the fquare of the velocity,&nbsp;and inverſely as the radius of curvature. The curvature,&nbsp;therefore, remaining the ſame, the tranſverſe forces, and&nbsp;conſequently the preffure on the body, muft be as the&nbsp;ſquare of the velocity : and, on the other hand, we can&nbsp;ſee pretty clearly (indeed it is rigorouſly demonſtrated&nbsp;by D Alembert), that whatever be the velocities, the&nbsp;curves </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">wit/</span><span class="font1"> be the ſame. For it is known in hydraulics,&nbsp;that it requires a fourfold or ninefold preffure to pro-duce a double or triple velocity. And as all preffures&nbsp;are propagated through a perfect fluid without diminution, this fourfold preffure, while it produces a double&nbsp;velocity,. produces alio fourfold tranſverſe preffures,&nbsp;which wiſl retain the particles, moving twice as faſt, in&nbsp;the ſame curvilineal paths. And thus we ſee that the&nbsp;impulſes, as they are called, and reſiſtances of fluids,&nbsp;haye a certain relation to the weight of a column of&nbsp;fluid, whofe height is the height neceſlary for producing&nbsp;the velocity. . How it happens that a plane ſurface, im-merſed in an extended fluid, ſuſtains juſt half the pref-ſure which it would have ſuſtained had the motions been&nbsp;ſuch as are ſketched in figure 6th, is a matter of more curious and difficult inveſtigation. But we fee evidently&nbsp;that the preffure muſt be leſs than what is there affigned;&nbsp;for the ſtagnant water a-head of the body greatly di-mimſhes the ultimate deflections of the filaments : And&nbsp;it may be demonſtrated, that when the part BE of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">canal, ſig. 9. is inclined to the part AB in an angle leſs than 90<sup>0</sup>, the preffures B G along the whole canal&nbsp;are as the verſed fine of the ultimate angle oſ deflection,&nbsp;or the verſed fine of the angle which the part BE makes&nbsp;with the part AB. Therefore, ſince the deflexions re-ſemble more the ſketch given in ſig. 1 o. the accumulated&nbsp;ſum of all theſe forces BG of ſig. 9. muſt be lefs than&nbsp;the ſimilar ſum correſponding to ſig. 6. that is, leſs than</span></p>
