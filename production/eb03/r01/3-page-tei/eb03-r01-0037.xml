By off-ſets. The time for ſeparating the off-ſets is in ſummer when the flower is paſt, and the leaves and ſtalks are withered : then taking up all the ro'ots in dry weather, feparate the off-ſets from each main root, and alter drying the whole gradually in ſome ſhady airy room, put them up in bags till the autumn and ſpring ſeaſons of planting ; then plant them as before, placing all the off-ſets in ſeparate beds : many of them will blow the firſt year, but in the ſecond they will all flower in good perfection.—2. By ſeed. Save a quantity of ſeed from the fineſt ſemi-double flowers, and ſow it either in Auguſt, or in March, or April, though, to ſave trouble -of winter-covering, ſome prefer the ſpring : it ſhould be lowed in light rich mould, either in pots or in an eaſt border, drawing very ſhallow flat drills five or fix inches aſunder, in which ſow the feeds thinly, and cover them lightly with earth, giving frequent refreſhments of water in dry weather, and in a month or ſix weeks the plants will rife with fmall leaves ; obſerving to continue the light waterings in dry weather, to preſerve the foil xnoiſt during their fummer’s growth to increaſe the ſize of the roots ; and in June when the leaves decay, take up the roots and preſerve them till the ieaſon for planting, then plant them in common beds, as before directed, and they will flower the ſpring following, when all the doubles of good properties ſhould be marked, and the Angles thrown away.</p><p>The juice of many ſpecies of ranunculus is ſo acrid as to raiſe bliſters on the ſkin, and yet the roots may be eaten with ſafety when boiled.</p><p>RAPACIOUS <hi rend="smallcaps">animals,</hi>  are ſuch as live upon prey.</p><p>RAPE, in law, the carnal knowledge of a woman forcibly and againſt her will. This, by the Jewiſh law, was pu ni ſhed with death, in caſe the damſel was betrothed to another man : and, in cafe ſhe was not betrothed, then a heavy fine of fifty ſhekels was to be paid to the damſel’s father, and ſhe was to be the wife of the raviſher all the days of his life ; without that power of divorce, which was in general permitted by the Moſaic law.</p><p>The civil law puniſhes the crime of raviſhment with death and confifcation of goods: under which it includes both the offence of forcible abduction, or taking away a woman from her friends ; and alſo the preſent offence of forcibly diſhonouring her ; either of which, without the other, is in that law ſufficient to conſtitute a capital crime. Alſo the ſtealing away a woman from her parents or guardians, and debauching her, is equaſly penal by the emperor’s edict, whether ſhe conſent or is forced. And this, in order to take away from women every opportunity of offending in this way; whom the Ro-man laws ſuppoſe never to go aſtray without the ſeduction and arts of the other ſex ; and therefore, by reſtraining and making ſo highly penal the ſolicitations of the men, they meant to fecure effectually the honour</p><p>of the women. But our Engliſh law does not enter* tain quite ſuch ſublime ideas of the honour of either ſex, as to lay the blame of a mutual fault upon one of the tranfgreffors only ; and therefore makes it a neceſk fary ingredient in the crime of rape, that it muſt be againſt the woman’s wiſl.</p><p>Rape was puniſhed by the Saxon laws, particularly thoſe of king Athelſtan, with death ; which was alſo agreeable to the old Gothic or Scandinavian conſtitution. But this was afterwards thought too hard : and in its ſtead another ſevere, but not capital, puniſhment was inflicted by william the Conqueror, viz. caſtration and loſs oſ eyes ; which continued till after Bracton wrote, in the reign of Henry III. But in order to prevent malicious accuſations, it was then the law, (and, it ſeems, ſtill continues to be ſo in appeals of rape), that the woman ſhould, immediately after, go to the next town, and there make diſcovery to ſome credible perſons of the injury ſhe has ſuffered ; and afterwards ſhould acquaint the high conſtable of the hundred, the coroners, and the ſheriff, with the outrage. This ſeems to correfpond in ſome degree with the laws of Scotland and Arragon, which require that complaint muſt be made within 24 hours : though afterwards by ſtatute w’eſtm. I. c. 13. the time of limitation in England was extended to 40 days. At preſent there is no ∙ time of limitation fixed: for, as it is uſuaſly now puniſhed by indictment at the fuit of the king, the maxim of law takes place, that " nullum tempus occurrit regi but the jury will rarely give credit to a ſtale complaint. During the former period alſo it was held for law, that the woman (by conſent of the judge and her parents) might redeem the offender from the execution of his ſentence, by accepting him for her huſhand ; if he alſo ■ wa⅛ willing to agree to the exchange* but not otherwiſe.</p><p>In the 3 Edw. I. by the ftatuté weſtſh. r. c. 13. the puniſhment of rape was much mitigated : the of--fence itſelf, of raviſhing a damſel within age, (that is, twelve years old) either with her conſent or without, or of any other woman againſt her will, being reduced to a trefpaſs,· if not proſccuted by appeal within 40 days, and ſubjecting the offender onIy to two years impriſon-ment, and a fine-at the king’s will.· But this lenity being productive of the moſt terrible conſequences, it was, in ten years afterwards, 13 Edw. I. found ncceffa-ιy to make the offence of forcible rape felony by ſtatute w^eftm. 2. c. 34. And by ſtatute 18 Eliz. c. 7. it is made felony without benefit of clergy : as is alſo the abominable wickedneſs of carnaſly knowing or abuſing any woman-child under the age of ten years ; in which caſe the conſent or non-confent is immaterial, as by reaſon of her tender years ſhe is incapable of judgment and diſcretion. Sir Matthew Hale is indeed of opinion, that ſuch profligate actions committed on an infant under the age of twelve years, the age oi female diſcretion by the common law, either with or without conſent, amount to rape and felony·; as well ſincc as before the ſtatute of queen Elizabeth : but that law has in general been held only to extend to infants under ten ; though it fnould ſeem that damſels between ten and twelve are ſtiil under the protection of the ſtatute wctlm. 1. the lav/ with reſpect to their ſeduction not having been al-tered by either of the ſubfequent ſtatutes.</p><p>A male infant, under the age. of fourteen years, is</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
