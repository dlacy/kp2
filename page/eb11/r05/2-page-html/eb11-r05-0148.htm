<p><span class="font0">foreign artificers. Like the European settlers on the coast of Africa in more recent times, they wished the barbarians of the&nbsp;interior to be restricted to the use of their primitive weapons.&nbsp;One of the Polish kings, for example, threatened with death&nbsp;the English sailors who should attempt to carry on the illicit&nbsp;trade in arms, on the ground that “ the Muscovite, who is not&nbsp;only our opponent of to-day but the eternal enemy of all&nbsp;free nations, should not be allowed to supply himself with&nbsp;cannons, bullets and munitions or with artisans who manufacture arms hitherto unknown to those barbarians.” This&nbsp;was precisely the reason why Ivan IV. was so anxious to force&nbsp;his way to the coast. His grandfather had obtained from&nbsp;Venice an “ artist ” who undertook “ to build churches and&nbsp;palaces, to cast big bells and cannons, to fire off the said cannons&nbsp;and to make every sort of castings very cunningly”; and with&nbsp;the aid of that clever Venetian he had become the proud possessor&nbsp;of a “ cannon-house,” subsequently dignified with the name of&nbsp;“arsenal.” In imitation of the grandfather the grandson&nbsp;gave a commission to a Saxon, in whom he had confidence, to&nbsp;collect artists and artisans in Germany and bring them&nbsp;to Moscow, but he was prevented from carrying out his&nbsp;scheme by the Livonian Order (1547)- A few years later (1553)&nbsp;he found unexpectedly a different route for communication&nbsp;with the West. A ship of an English squadron which was trying&nbsp;to reach China by the North-East passage, entered the&nbsp;northern Dvina, and her captain, Richard Chancellor,&nbsp;journeyed to Moscow in quest of opportunities for trade.&nbsp;He met with such a favourable reception from the tsar&nbsp;that on his return to England a special envoy was sent&nbsp;to Moscow by Queen Mary, and he succeeded in obtaining for&nbsp;his countrymen the privilege of trading freely in Russian towns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In return the Russians were allowed to trade freely in England. This afforded great satisfaction to Ivan, but it did not entirely&nbsp;satisfy his requirements, because the new route by the White&nbsp;Sea and North Cape was long and uncertain and for a great&nbsp;part of the year communications were stopped by the ice. He&nbsp;continued, therefore, his efforts to reach the Baltic coast, and&nbsp;he soon came into collision with the Swedes. After a dilatory&nbsp;war of three years he concluded a peace on the ground of free&nbsp;commercial relations, and then he attacked the Livonian Order,&nbsp;on the pretext that the Livonian town of Dorpat had not paid&nbsp;tribute according to ancient treaties. Finding himself unable&nbsp;to resist the Muscovites, the grand master of the Order put&nbsp;himself under Polish protection, and this led to a seven years’&nbsp;war (1563-70) with Poland, during which the Swedes and&nbsp;Danes intervened on their own account. Ivan did not display&nbsp;much military talent, but he showed a remarkable amount of&nbsp;tenacity. No sooner had he made peace with the Poles and&nbsp;failed to get himself elected as their king, than he began a war&nbsp;with the Swedes which dragged on for more than a decade (1572-1583), and before it was ended he was again at war with Poland&nbsp;{1579-81). Though severely tried by disappointments and&nbsp;defeats he never lost hope, and when he died in 1584 he was&nbsp;preparing to renew the struggle and endeavouring to form for&nbsp;that purpose an alliance with England; his great idea, however,&nbsp;was not to he realized till more than a century later, and meanwhile the tsardom of Muscovy had to pass through a severe&nbsp;internal crisis in which its existence was seriously endangered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ivan the Terrible had succeeded in stamping out ruthlessly all open resistance to his will, and had created an autocratic&nbsp;government of the Oriental type; but the elements&nbsp;of disorder were still lying beneath the surface, and&nbsp;as soon as the cunning, energetic despot died they&nbsp;reappeared. His son and successor, Theodore (Feodor), was&nbsp;a weak man of saintly character, very ill fitted to consolidate his father’s work and maintain order among the&nbsp;ambitious, turbulent nobles; but he had the good fortune&nbsp;to have an energetic brother-in-law, with no pretensions to&nbsp;sanctity, called Boris Godunov, who was able, with the tsar’s&nbsp;moral support, to keep his fellow-boyars in order. This he&nbsp;did during fourteen years, and his administration was signalized&nbsp;by two important innovations—the attaching of the peasants</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">to the land </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(adseriplio glebae)</span><span class="font0"> and the creation of the patriarchate —both of which deserve a passing notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Boris has often been called the creator of serfage in Russia, but in reality he merely accelerated a process which was the&nbsp;natural result of economic conditions. In a primitive,&nbsp;thinly populated, agricultural country, in which the&nbsp;demand for agricultural labour greatly exceeds the&nbsp;supply, the value of land is in proportion to the number&nbsp;of permanent labourers settled on it, and the landed proprietors naturally try to attract to their estates as many&nbsp;peasants as possible; and in this competition the large&nbsp;proprietors have evidently an advantage over their humbler and&nbsp;weaker rivals. Such had been for a considerable time the condition of Russia, and the small proprietors were now becoming&nbsp;so impoverished that they could no longer fulfil their duties&nbsp;to the state. The remedy they proposed was that the labourers&nbsp;should be prohibited from migrating from one estate to another,&nbsp;and an order to that effect was issued, with the result that the&nbsp;peasants, being no longer able to change their domicile and&nbsp;seek new employers, fell practically under the unlimited power&nbsp;of the proprietors on whose land they resided. This change&nbsp;was, of course, popular among the lower and middle ranks of&nbsp;the landlord class, but was very displeasing to the great nobles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The second of the two innovations above mentioned was popular among all classes. Hitherto the highest authority in&nbsp;the Russian Church was the metropolitan, w<sup>T</sup>ho was&nbsp;nominally under the jurisdiction of the patriarch of&nbsp;Constantinople, and as soon as Constantinople fell&nbsp;into the hands of the infidel, and the tsars of Muscovy claimed&nbsp;to be the successors of the Byzantine emperors, it seemed right&nbsp;and proper that the Russian Church should become autocephalous&nbsp;and he governed by an independent Russian patriarch. The&nbsp;change was very dexterously effected by Godunov, with the&nbsp;formal assent of the Eastern Orthodox Church as a whole, and&nbsp;one of his adherents was placed on the patriarchal throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Having thus gained the support of a large majority of the landed proprietors and the ecclesiastics, Boris Godunov increased his influence to such an extent that on the&nbsp;death of Tsar Feodor without male issue in 1598 he&nbsp;was elected his successor by a Great National Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His short reign was not so successful as his administration under the weak Feodor. The oligarchical party considered it a disgrace to obey a simple boyar; conspiracies&nbsp;were frequent, the rural districts were desolated by famine&nbsp;and plague, great bands of armed brigands roamed about the&nbsp;country committing all manner of atrocities, the Cossacks on&nbsp;the frontier were restless, and the government showed itself&nbsp;incapable of maintaining order. Under the influence of the&nbsp;great nobles who had unsuccessfully opposed the election of&nbsp;Godunov, the general discontent took the form of hostility&nbsp;to him as a usurper, and rumours were heard that the late&nbsp;tsar’s younger brother Dimitri (Demetrius), supposed&nbsp;to be dead, was still alive and in hiding. In 1603&nbsp;a man calling himself Dimitri, and professing to be&nbsp;the rightful heir to the throne, appeared in Poland,&nbsp;and a few months later he crossed the frontier with a large&nbsp;force of Poles, Russian exiles, German mercenaries and&nbsp;Cossacks from the Dnieper and the Don. In reality the&nbsp;younger son of Ivan the Terrible had been strangled before&nbsp;his brother’s death—by orders, it was said, of Godunov—and&nbsp;the mysterious individual who was impersonating him was an .&nbsp;impostor; but he was regarded as the rightful heir by a large&nbsp;section of the population, and immediately after Boris’s death&nbsp;in 1605 he made his triumphal entry into Moscow. Thus began&nbsp;a period of Russian history commonly called “ the Troublous&nbsp;Times, ” which lasted until 1613. (See Demetrius, Pseudo-.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The reign of Dirititri was short and uneventful. Before a year had passed a conspiracy was formed against him by&nbsp;an ambitious noble called Basil (Vassili) Shuiski, and&nbsp;he was assassinated in the Kremlin. The chief conspirator, Shuiski, seized the power and was elected&nbsp;tsar by an Assembly composed of his faction, but neither</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
