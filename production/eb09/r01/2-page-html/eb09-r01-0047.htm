There are in the locking frame&nbsp;thirty-two slides and about a thousand locks, and an idea of the&nbsp;duty that falls on this apparatus may be formed from the fact&nbsp;that 775 trains have passed under the signal-bridge in a single&nbsp;working day (Whit-Monday), and that, each train being reversed&nbsp;here, a fresh engine has to be attached to it, the superseded engine&nbsp;being passed into a siding. In the course of thirty-five minutes&nbsp;one morning thirty-five trains were signalled and passed in or out&nbsp;of the station. The duty of signalling is performed by tw<sup>τ</sup>o men.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The total cost of the works of the whole Charing Cross Railway, from London Bridge station to Cannon Street and Charing Cross,&nbsp;with the terminal stations, was £1,160,118. The cost of the land&nbsp;for the whole railway, after deducting the value of surplus land,&nbsp;Hungerford Bridge, pier tolls, &amp;c., was £1,900,000, making a total&nbsp;for land and works of over £3,000,000. For this sum there are&nbsp;4⅜ miles of railway for double line, the cost being at the rate of&nbsp;£680,000 per mile. The works include two large bridges over the&nbsp;river Thames, a number of expensive bridges over streets, viaducts,&nbsp;and two large metropolitan termini. The cost for land at Cannon&nbsp;Street station was at the rate of £3,15s. 7d. per square foot, and&nbsp;that at Charing Cross station was £2, 18s. 5d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">St Pancras passenger station of the Midland Railway is the most recently constructed metropolitan terminus. The approach to the&nbsp;land on which the station is built was crossed by the Regent’s&nbsp;Canal, and in order to secure good gradients and suitable levels for&nbsp;metropolitan suburban stations the main passenger line is earned&nbsp;over the canal ; and, as a result, the level of St Pancras station is&nbsp;from 12 to 17 feet higher than that of the adjoining roads. The&nbsp;St Pancras branch, on the contrary, for effecting a junction with&nbsp;the Metropolitan Railway, leaving the main line some distance&nbsp;from the terminus, descends through a tunnel beneath the Regent’s&nbsp;Canal and the passenger station, as well as under a considerable&nbsp;length of the main line. The height of the rails above the ground-level admitted of the construction of a lower floor with direct access&nbsp;to the streets, built and arranged for Burton beer traffic. The floor&nbsp;of the station is supported on girders and columns extending from&nbsp;side to side and acting as a tie for the roof girders, which start&nbsp;from the ground-level and form the roof as a single arch. The ribs&nbsp;or girders forming the roof are laid to a clear span of 240 feet ; the&nbsp;walls built between the ribs are 245½ feet apart. The clear height&nbsp;of the ribs above the level of the platforms is 96 feet at the centre.&nbsp;The length of the station is 689 feet 4 inches. The lower floor&nbsp;contains 720 cast-iron columns set on brick piers, and 49 rows of&nbsp;principal girders across the station, with 15 rows longitudinally.&nbsp;Upon these intermediate girders are carried, and the whole is covered&nbsp;in with Mallett’s buckled plates. The cost of the ironwork of the&nbsp;floor was £57,000, being at the rate of £3, 0s. 6d. per square yard.&nbsp;The roof girders, twenty-five in number, are placed at intervals of&nbsp;29 feet 4 inches, except at the outer end, where the last two girders&nbsp;are only 14 feet 8 inches apart. The cost of the roof, including&nbsp;covering, with two gables and screens, amounted to £69,365, being&nbsp;at the rate of £40, 18s. per square of 100 square feet or 10 feet&nbsp;square. If there had not been any floor-girders to act as roof-ties,&nbsp;the extra cost for ties at the level of the floor would have been&nbsp;about £1 per square.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The goods and mineral station at King’s Cross may be selected as an example of such stations. It comprises coal dépôts and wharves,&nbsp;potato-stores, engine-sheds, repairing sheds, stores, stables, and all&nbsp;the necessary offices, buildings, and appliances required for the&nbsp;goods and mineral traffic of the company. Twelve lines of rail run&nbsp;into the goods-shed, with a platform at each side for the receipt&nbsp;and despatch of goods. On the outer side of the rails, within the&nbsp;building, space is reserved for the vans engaged in collecting and&nbsp;distributing the goods. The outer line of rails at the east side of&nbsp;the platform is used for unloading the -waggons with the inward&nbsp;goods, and that on the west side for loading the outward goods.&nbsp;The inner lines nearest to these are used for the arrival of goods&nbsp;trains, for empty waggons, and for making up trains for departure.&nbsp;The waggons, after being unloaded, are taken by means of turntables and cross-roads to the departure side of the station, where&nbsp;the business of loading and despatching them is carried on. The&nbsp;platforms have each two rows of hydraulic cranes, of 1 and 2 tons&nbsp;lifting power alternately. The receiving offices are on the platforms, but the general offices are adjacent to the main building.&nbsp;The stables are under the platform ; the granary is at the south&nbsp;end of the goods-shed, through which it is approached by two lines&nbsp;running through the middle of the shed,—two other lines, one on&nbsp;each side of them, being reserved for full waggons. When emptied,&nbsp;the waggons are removed by two lines which run one on each outer&nbsp;side of the goods-shed. The shed and the granary are supplied&nbsp;with water communication through tunnels under the roads to a&nbsp;basin on the south, and thence to the Regent’s Canal ; and lighters&nbsp;can receive or discharge their freights directly under the buildings.&nbsp;On the west of the goods-shed are the coal dépôts and staiths. The&nbsp;coal arriving at the station is discharged in some cases directly&nbsp;from the waggons into carts alongside ; in other cases it is discharged through hoppers on to weighing machines at a lower level,&nbsp;and thence filled into sacks. For this operation there is a frontage&nbsp;of 343 yards ; and there is in addition a coal dépôt in Cambridge&nbsp;Street, adjoining the goods-yard, with a frontage of 196 yards.&nbsp;There is a coal and stone dock or basin connected with the Regent’s&nbsp;Canal, where barges are loaded directly from the coal - waggons,&nbsp;either through doorways in the bottom of the waggons or by discharging the coal from the sides of the waggons into hoppers.&nbsp;There is also a hopper at the Cambridge Street dépôt for the purpose of loading barges on the canal. Adjoining the canal basin&nbsp;there are numerous private wharves for bricks and other merchandise. To the north are the locomotive and carriage sheds for repairing the stock, also two engine-running sheds, one round and the&nbsp;other rectangular. The goods, mineral, and locomotive stations&nbsp;cover an area of about 70 acres, and the total area covered by the&nbsp;goods and passenger stations and the running lines to Copenhagen&nbsp;tunnel is upwards of 90 acres. The principal goods-shed and&nbsp;granary is 300 feet long and 175 wide, and the area occupied by the&nbsp;goods-warehouses, potato-market, coal-offices, and other buildings&nbsp;amounts to 8¾ acres. In addition, 1 acre is covered by open sheds&nbsp;and 1⅜ acres by the stables and the engineers’ shops. The engine-sheds can hold eighty-four engines and tenders, and they, with the&nbsp;workshops, tanks, carriage-repairing shops, and sundry premises,&nbsp;cover 2½ acres.@@<sup>1</sup> There are in the goods, mineral, and engine yards&nbsp;28½ miles of single line of way and more than 250 sets of switches,&nbsp;200 turn-tables for waggons, and one for engines and tenders ; of&nbsp;that length of line 11⅜ miles of sidings are used for coal-waggons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is unnecessary to dwell at length on the arrangement of small terminal stations for branch lines. Where the line is single a&nbsp;single platform suffices, the trains being light and moving only in&nbsp;one direction at one time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In fixing intermediate stations the first step should be to get a good map of all the places -within the scope of the railway, and to&nbsp;mark upon it the population of each place from the last parliamentary census. The greater the number of stations, the more the&nbsp;travelling increases ; for quick and cheap transit creates traffic.&nbsp;Stations, especially important ones, should be on the surface rather&nbsp;than on an embankment or a viaduct or in a cutting. Facilities&nbsp;of access in all directions from the surrounding districts, with good&nbsp;roads in the case of passenger traffic, and good water and railway&nbsp;communication for goods dépôts, are obviously indispensable. For&nbsp;safety and regularity there should be an uninterrupted view along&nbsp;the line of railway—no sharp curves or complication of over-bridges&nbsp;—in the vicinity of a large station. Intermediate and junction&nbsp;stations should be situated on dead levels, since, when a good&nbsp;length of level can be had, with gradients falling from it both&nbsp;ways, there is the greatest possible facility for working the traffic.&nbsp;Falling gradients towards a station are objectionable, but cannot&nbsp;in all cases be avoided. When the station is situated midway&nbsp;between towns of such extent as to cause an equal flow of traffic in&nbsp;each direction, offices may be requisite on both sides of the line ;&nbsp;but, where the bulk of the traffic tends one way only, it will be&nbsp;desirable to concentrate it on that side which involves the larger&nbsp;number of passengers and the greater extent of waiting space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@1 The headquarters of the locomotive and carriage department are at Doncaster station.</span></p>
