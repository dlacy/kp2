<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rowley RAGG, a genus of ſtones, belonging to the ſiliceous claſs. Ir is of a duſky or dark grey co-lour, with many ſmall Paining cryſtals, having a granular&nbsp;texture, and acquiring an oc'nry cruſt by expoſure to&nbsp;the air. The ſpecific gravity is 2748. It becomes&nbsp;magnetic by being heated in an open fire. In a ſtrong&nbsp;fire it melts without addition, but with morc difficulty&nbsp;than baſaltes. It was analyſed by Dr withering, who&nbsp;found that 100 parts of it contain 47.5 of ſihceous&nbsp;earth, 32.5 of argil, and 20 of iron.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The ancients had a ragout called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">garum,</span><span class="font0"> made of the putrified guts of a certain fiſh kept till it diſſolved&nbsp;into a mere fanies, which was thought ſuch a dainty,&nbsp;that, according to Pliny, its price equalled that of the&nbsp;richeſt perfumes.</span></p>

It is of a grey colour ; the&nbsp;texture obſcurely laminar, or rather, fibrous ; but the&nbsp;laminæ or fibres confiſt of a congeries of grains of a&nbsp;quartzy appearance, coarſe and rough. The ſpeciſic&nbsp;gravity is 2729 ; it eſſerveſces with acids, and ſtrikes&nbsp;lire with ſteel. Mr Kirwan found it to contain a portion&nbsp;of mild calareous earth, and a ſmall proportion of iron.&nbsp;It is uſed’tis a whetſtone for coarſe cutting took. It is&nbsp;found about Newcaſtle, and many other parts of Eng-land, where there are large rocks of it in the hills.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RAJA, the title of the Indian black princes, the re-mains of thoſe who ruled there before the Moguls. Some of the rajas are ſaid to preferve their independen-cy, efpecially in the mountainous parts ; but moſt of&nbsp;them pay an annual tribute to the Mogul. The Indians call them </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rai ;</span><span class="font0"> the Perfians, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">raian,</span><span class="font0"> in the plural ;&nbsp;and our travellers </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rajas,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ragias.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raja, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ray-F'ιjh,</span><span class="font0"> in ichthyology; a genus be-longing to the order of Chondropterygia. There are five fpiracula below towards the peak ; the body compreffed ; and the mouth is ſituated under the head. The&nbsp;moſt remarkable ſpecies are,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I. The batis, or ſkate : this ſpecies is the thinncſt&nbsp;in proportion to its bulk of any of the genus, and alſo&nbsp;the largeſt, fome weighing near 200 pounds. The&nbsp;noſe, though not long, is ſharp pointed ; above the eyes&nbsp;is a fet of ſhort ſpines: the upper part is of a pale&nbsp;brown, fometimes ſtreaked with black : tbe lower part&nbsp;is white, marked with great numbers of minute black,&nbsp;ſpots. The jaws are covered with ſmall granulated but ſharp-pointed teeth. The tail is of a moderate length : near the end are two fins : along the top&nbsp;of it is one row of ſpines, and on the edges are irregularly diſperſed a few others, which makes us imagine&nbsp;with Mr Ray, that in thia reſpect theſe fiſh vary, ſome&nbsp;having one, others more orders of ſpines on the tail.&nbsp;It is remarked, that in the males of this ſpecies thc&nbsp;fins arc full of fpines. Skates generate in March and&nbsp;April ; at which time they ſwim near the ſurface&nbsp;of the water, ſeveral of the males purſuing one female.&nbsp;They adhcre ſo faſt together in coition, that the fiſher-men frequently draw up both together, though only&nbsp;one has taken the bait. The females begin to caſt their&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">purſes,</span><span class="font0"> as the ſiſhermen call them (the bags in which&nbsp;the young are included) in May, and continue doing it&nbsp;till September. In october they are exceedingly poor&nbsp;and thin ; but in November they begin to improve, and&nbsp;grow gradually better till May, when they are in the&nbsp;higheſt perfection. The males go ſooner out of ſeaſon&nbsp;than the females.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. The oxyrinchus, or ſharp-noſed ray, in length near&nbsp;feven feet, and breadth five feet two inches ; when juſt&nbsp;brought on ſhore, it makes a remarkable fnorting noiſe·.&nbsp;The noſe is very long, narrow, and ſharp-pointed, not&nbsp;unlike the end of a ſpontoon. The body is ſmooth,&nbsp;and very thin in proportion to the fize ; the upper part&nbsp;aſh-coloured, ſpotted with numerous white ſpots, and&nbsp;a few black ones. The tail is thick ; towards the&nbsp;end are two ſmall fins ; on each fide is a row of ſmall&nbsp;ſpines, with another row in the middle, which runs&nbsp;ſome way up the back. The lower part of the fiſn&nbsp;is quite white. The mouth is very large, and furniſhed&nbsp;with numbers of ſmall ſharp teeth bending inwards.&nbsp;This ſiſh has been ſuppoled to be the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">los</span><span class="font0"> of the anci-</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">3</span></p>
