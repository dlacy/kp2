Educated in medicine and science chiefly at the university of Berlin, he became successively professor of zoology, physiology, and comparative anatomy in Königsberg, Erlangen, Freiburg, Breslau, and Munich. In conjunction with Stannius he published (1845-48) a <hi rend="italic">Manual of Comparative Anatomy,</hi> which is still of solid value; and along with Kölliker he founded in 1848 a journal which soon took and still retains a leading place in biological literature, <hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Zoologie.</hi> He was also a laborious and successful helminthologist (see Parasitism) and entomologist, in both capacities contributing many valuable papers to his journal, which he continued to edit until his death in 1885. In these ways, without being a man of marked genius, but rather an industrious and critical observer, he came to fill a peculiarly distinguished position in science, and was long reckoned, what his biographer justly calls him, the Nestor of German zoology.
