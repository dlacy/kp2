<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RENNIE, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">John </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1761-1821), engineer and architect, was the son of a farmer, and was born at Phantassie, East&nbsp;Lothian, 7th June 1761. While attending the parish&nbsp;school of East Linton he had to pass the workshop of&nbsp;Andrew Meikle, the inventor of the thrashing machine,&nbsp;and evinced such a strong interest in the operations&nbsp;there in progress that the workmen were in the habit of&nbsp;lending him their tools and teaching him their various&nbsp;uses. In his twelfth year he left school and placed himself under Meikle, but at the end of two years he went to&nbsp;a school at Dunbar, in order to obtain a more thorough&nbsp;knowledge of mathematics and mechanical drawing. Afterwards he occasionally assisted Meikle, but before his&nbsp;eighteenth year he had erected several corn mills, on his&nbsp;׳own account, while in the winter months he visited Edinburgh to attend the classes of physical science at the&nbsp;university. By Prof. Robison of Edinburgh he was introduced to Messrs Boulton &amp; Watt of Soho near Birmingham, for whom in 1786 he superintended the construction&nbsp;of the Albion flour mills near Blackfriars Bridge, London.&nbsp;It is believed that the difficulties which occurred at the&nbsp;Albion mills in regard to the ebb and flow of the tide first&nbsp;led Rennie to the study of that branch of civil engineering&nbsp;connected with hydraulics and hydrodynamics, in which&nbsp;he became so celebrated as to have no rival after the death&nbsp;of Smeaton. Immediately after the completion of the&nbsp;Albion mills Rennie’s reputation was so firmly established&nbsp;in everything connected with mill work that he found&nbsp;himself in a very extensive line of business. In the construction of sugar mills in Jamaica and the other West&nbsp;Indian Islands he soon had almost a monopoly, and among&nbsp;·other mills constructed by him in England mention may&nbsp;be made of the powder mill at Tunbridge, the great flour&nbsp;mill at Wandsworth, and the rolling and triturating mills&nbsp;at the Mint on Tower Hill. Wherever the machinery&nbsp;of his mills was impelled by steam, the engines of his&nbsp;friends Messrs Boulton Watt supplied the motive power.&nbsp;It is, however, on his achievements as an architect and&nbsp;civil engineer that the fame of Rennie chiefly rests. Of&nbsp;the bridges connecting the banks of the Thames at London,&nbsp;three have been built from his designs,—Southwark Bridge,&nbsp;in the construction of which he introduced a method of&nbsp;׳employing cast iron which formed a new epoch in the&nbsp;history of bridge-building ; Waterloo Bridge, which then&nbsp;had no parallel for its magnitude, elegance, and solidity;&nbsp;and London Bridge, on the model of Waterloo Bridge.&nbsp;Bridges at Leeds, Musselburgh, Kelso, Newton-Stewart,&nbsp;Boston, New Galloway, and numerous other places bear&nbsp;similar testimony to his skill and taste. His earliest canal&nbsp;project was that of the Crinan Canal, and following it was&nbsp;the Lancaster Canal, which besides other difficulties presented that of an aqueduct over the Lune. His execution&nbsp;of these works so established his reputation that his opinion&nbsp;and assistance were required from all quarters in regard&nbsp;to similar undertakings, among others the construction of&nbsp;the Great Western Canal in Somersetshire, the Polbrook&nbsp;Canal in Cornwall, the Portsmouth Canal, and the Avon&nbsp;and Kennet Canal. But more important than these were&nbsp;his works in connexion with docks and harbours, his&nbsp;designs embracing the London Docks, the East and West&nbsp;India Docks at Blackwall, and docks at Hull, Greenock,&nbsp;Leith, Liverpool, and Dublin. The harbours of Queens-ferry, Berwick, Howth, Holyhead, Kingstown, Newhaven,&nbsp;and several others owe their security and convenience to&nbsp;his labours. But even these works mast yield to what he&nbsp;executed in connexion with the Government dockyards at&nbsp;Portsmouth, Chatham, Sheerness, and Plymouth. One&nbsp;other effort of his genius falls to be mentioned, the drainage of that vast tract of marsh-land bordering upon the&nbsp;rivers Trent, Witham, Welland, and Ouse which for cen</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">turies had baffled the skill of some of the ablest men in that department of civil engineering. Rennie’s industry&nbsp;was very extraordinary; though fond of the society of his&nbsp;select friends and of rational conversation, he never suffered&nbsp;amusement of any kind to interfere with his business,&nbsp;which seldom engaged him less than twelve hours and&nbsp;frequently fifteen in the day. His conversation was&nbsp;always amusing and instructive. In person he was of&nbsp;great stature and strength; and his noble bust by Chantrey,&nbsp;when exhibited in Somerset House, obtained the name of&nbsp;Jupiter Tonans. He died 16th October 1821.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">His son </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sir John Rennie </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(born August </span><span class="font1">30, 1794, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">died Sept. </span><span class="font1">1874) </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">succeeded him as engineer to the Admiralty, and acquired a&nbsp;high reputation in the same line of business as his father. On the&nbsp;completion of the London Bridge from his father’s designs in </span><span class="font1">1831,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">he received the honour of knighthood. He was the author of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Theory, Formation, and Construction of British and Foreign&nbsp;Harbours,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1">4 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">vols., </span><span class="font1">1851-54.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RENT is classed in English law as an incorporeal hereditament, that is, a profit issuing out of a corporeal hereditament (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Real Estate). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A rent issuing but of an incorporeal hereditament can only be possessed by the&nbsp;crown, or by a subject under statutory authority. Rent is&nbsp;said to lie in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">render</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, as distinguished from profits </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">d prendre&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">in general, which are said to lie in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">prender.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> At the present&nbsp;day rent is generally a sum of money paid for the occupation of land. It is important to notice that this conception of rent is attained at a comparatively late period of&nbsp;history. The earliest rent seems to have been a form of&nbsp;personal service, generally labour on the land, and w<sup>r</sup>as at&nbsp;the same time fixed by custom. The exaction of a competition or rack rent beyond that limited by custom was, if&nbsp;one may judge from the old Brehon law of Ireland, due to&nbsp;the presence upon the land of strangers in blood, probably&nbsp;at first outcasts from some other group.@@<sup>1</sup> The strict&nbsp;feudal theory of rent admitted labour on the lord’s land as&nbsp;a lower form, and at the same time developed the military&nbsp;service due to the crown or a lord as a, higher form. Rent&nbsp;service is at once the oldest and the most dignified kind of&nbsp;existing rent. It is the only one to ■which the power of&nbsp;distress attaches at common law, giving the landlord a&nbsp;preferential right over other creditors exercisable without&nbsp;judicial authority (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Distress). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In course of time the&nbsp;increasing importance of socage tenure, arising in part from&nbsp;the convenience of paying a certain amount, whether in&nbsp;money or kind, rather than comparatively uncertain services, led to the gradual evolution of the modern view of&nbsp;rent as a sum due by contract between two independent&nbsp;persons. At the same time the primitive feeling which&nbsp;regarded the position of landlord and tenant from a social&nbsp;rather than a commercial point of view is still of importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Rents as they now exist in England are divided into three great classes—rent service, rent charge, and rent&nbsp;seek. A rent service is so called because by it a tenure&nbsp;by means of service is created between the landlord and&nbsp;the tenant. The service is now represented by fealty, and&nbsp;is nothing more than nominal. Rent service is said to be&nbsp;incident to the reversion, that is, a grant of the reversion&nbsp;carries the rent with it (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Remainder). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A power of&nbsp;distress is incident at common law to this form of rent.&nbsp;Copyhold rents and rents reserved on lease fall into this&nbsp;class. A rent charge is a grant of an annual sum payable&nbsp;out of lands in which the grantor has an estate. It may&nbsp;be in fee, in tail, for life, or for years. It must be created&nbsp;by deed or will, and may be either at common law or&nbsp;under the Statute of Uses. The grantor has no reversion,&nbsp;and the grantee has at common law no power of distress.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
