                themselves with troops of slaves and&nbsp;dependents, and to live rather as princes
                than as citizens of&nbsp;a republic. The </span><span class="font3"

                formed a second&nbsp;order in the state, which rivalled the first in wealth and
                coveted&nbsp;a share in its political supremacy; while the third estate,

                the&nbsp;same time sinking into the condition of an idle proletariat.
                The&nbsp;accentuation of class distinctions is indeed inevitable in
                a&nbsp;capitalist society, such as that of Rome was now becoming.&nbsp;But the
                process was fraught with grave political danger owing&nbsp;to the peculiarities of
                the Roman constitution, which rested in&nbsp;theory on the ultimate sovereignty of
                the people, who were in&nbsp;practice represented by the city mob. To win the
                support of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"
                >plebs</span><span class="font3"> became a necessity for ambitious politicians, and
                the&nbsp;means employed for this end poisoned the political life of Rome.&nbsp;The
                wealth derived from the provinces was freely spent in&nbsp;bribery,@@<sup>1</sup>
                and the populace of Rome was encouraged to claim as&nbsp;the price of its support a
                share in the spoils of empire.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font3">It was not only the structure and composition of Roman society that
                underwent a transformation. The victory of&nbsp;Rome in her struggle for supremacy
                in the Mediterranean basin had been largely due to the powerful&nbsp;conservative
                forces by which her institutions were&nbsp;preserved from decay. Respect for the
                </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mos majorum,&nbsp;</span><span
                class="font3">or ancestral custom, imposed an effective check on the desire&nbsp;for
                innovation. Though personal religion, in the deeper sense,&nbsp;was foreign to the
                Roman temperament, there was a genuine&nbsp;belief in the gods whose favour had made
                Rome great in the&nbsp;past and would uphold her in the future so long as
                she&nbsp;trod in the old paths of loyalty and devotion. Above all,&nbsp;the healthy
                moral traditions of early Rome were maintained&nbsp;by the discipline of the family,
                resting on the supreme authority&nbsp;of the father—the </span><span class="font3"
                style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas—</span><span class="font3">and the
                powerful influence&nbsp;of the mother, to whom the early training of the child
                    was&nbsp;entrusted.@@<sup>2</sup> Finally, the institution of the censorship,
                backed&nbsp;as it was by the mighty force of public opinion, provided
                a&nbsp;deterrent which prevented any flagrant deviation from the&nbsp;accepted
                standard of morals. All this was changed by the&nbsp;influence of Greek
                civilization, with which Rome was first&nbsp;brought face to face in the 3rd century
                </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span
                class="font3"> owing to her&nbsp;relations with Magna Graecia. At first the results
                of contact&nbsp;with the older and more brilliant culture of Hellas were on
                the&nbsp;whole good. In the 2nd century </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.,</span><span class="font3"> when constant
                intercourse&nbsp;was established with the communities of Greece proper and&nbsp;of
                Asia Minor, “ philhellenism ” became a passion, which was&nbsp;strongest in the best
                minds of the day and resulted in a quickened&nbsp;intellectual activity, wider
                sympathies and a more humane&nbsp;life. But at the same time the “new learning” was
                a disturbing and unsettling force. The Roman citizen was confronted&nbsp;with new
                doctrines in politics and religion, and initiated into&nbsp;the speculations of
                critical philosophy.@@<sup>3</sup> Under the influence&nbsp;of this powerful solvent
                the fabric of tradition embodied in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3"
                style="font-style:italic;">mos majorum</span><span class="font3"> fell to pieces; a
                revolt set in against Roman&nbsp;discipline and Roman traditions of self-effacement,
                and the&nbsp;craving for individual distinction asserted itself with
                irresistible&nbsp;vehemence. As it had been in the days of the “ Sophistic
                ”&nbsp;movement at Athens, so it was now with Rome; a higher&nbsp;education, which,
                owing to its expense, was necessarily confined&nbsp;to the wealthier classes,
                interposed between the upper and lower&nbsp;ranks of society a barrier even more
                effectual than that set up&nbsp;by differences of material condition, and by
                releasing the individual from the trammels of traditional morality, gave
                his&nbsp;ambition free course. The effect on private morals may be&nbsp;gauged by
                the vehemence with which the reactionary opposition, headed by M. Porcius Cato
                (consul, 195 B.c.; censor, 184&nbsp;</span><span class="font1"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.),</span><span class="font3"> inveighed against
                the new fashions, and by the&nbsp;list of measures passed to check the growth of
                luxury&nbsp;and licence, and to exclude the foreign teachers of the
                    new&nbsp;learning.@@<sup>4</sup> It was all in vain. The art of rhetoric, which
                was&nbsp;studied through the medium of Greek treatises and Greek&nbsp;models,
                furnished the Roman noble with weapons of attack&nbsp;and defence of which he was
                not slow to avail himself in the&nbsp;forum and the senate-house. In the science of
                money-making,&nbsp;which had been elaborated under the Hellenistic
                monarchies,&nbsp;the Roman capitalists proved apt pupils of their Greek
                teachers.&nbsp;Among the lower classes, contact with foreign slaves and freed-men,
                with foreign worships and foreign vices, produced a love&nbsp;of novelty which no
                legislation could check. Even amongst&nbsp;women there were symptoms of revolt
                against the old order,&nbsp;which showed itself in a growing freedom of manners and
                impatience of control,@@<sup>5</sup> the marriage tie was relaxed,@@<sup>6</sup> and
                the&nbsp;respect for mother and wife, which had been so powerful a&nbsp;factor in
                the maintenance of the Roman standard of morals,&nbsp;was grievously diminished.
                Thus Rome was at length brought&nbsp;face to face with a moral and economic crisis
                which a modern&nbsp;historian has described in the words: “ Italy was living
                through&nbsp;the fever of moral disintegration and incoherence which
                assails&nbsp;all civilized societies that are rich in the manifold resources
                of&nbsp;culture and enjoyment, but tolerate few or no restraints on&nbsp;the
                feverish struggle of contending appetites.” In this struggle&nbsp;the Roman Republic
                perished, and personal government took&nbsp;its place. The world had outgrown the
                city-state and its&nbsp;political machinery, and as the notions of federalism (on
                any&nbsp;large scale) and representative government had not yet come&nbsp;into
                being, no solution of the problem was possible save that&nbsp;of absolutism. But a
                far stronger resistance would have been&nbsp;opposed to political revolution by the
                republican system had not&nbsp;public morals been sapped by the influences above
                described.&nbsp;Political corruption was reduced to a science@@<sup>7</sup> for the
                benefit&nbsp;of individuals who were often faced with the alternatives of&nbsp;ruin
                or, revolution;@@<sup>8</sup> there was no longer any body of sound&nbsp;public
                opinion to which, in the last resort, appeal could be made;&nbsp;and, long before
                the final catastrophe took place, Roman society&nbsp;itself had become, in structure
                and temper, thoroughly unrepublican.</span></p><div>
