<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">matters of business first began there is still considerable doubt. That no rolls of a date antecedent to that of the&nbsp;31st Henry I. are now in existence is certain. It may&nbsp;therefore be presumed that the practice of enrolling commenced shortly after the Conquest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Court of Chancery</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">.— Owing to the vast quantity of documents of this court, only the salient points of the&nbsp;principal series of rolls can be dealt with. Among the&nbsp;most important enrolments belonging to this court is the&nbsp;extensive series of documents known as the close rolls or&nbsp;Rotuli Litterarum Clausarum. Upon their well-preserved&nbsp;parchment membranes the historian scans entries relating&nbsp;—to the privileges of peers and commoners in times gone&nbsp;by; to measures employed for the raising of armies and&nbsp;the equipment of fleets; to orders for the observance of&nbsp;treaties, and for the fortification of castles; and to laws&nbsp;innumerable touching the power of the bench, the authority&nbsp;of the church, the extent of the civil jurisdiction, and&nbsp;the prerogatives of the crown. By the help of these&nbsp;rolls the lawyer and antiquary can learn how the coinage&nbsp;of the realm was regulated, how aids and imposts, toll-ages and subsidies, were raised, how riots and tumults&nbsp;were suppressed, how state prisoners were pardoned, how&nbsp;the writs ran for the summoning of parliaments, what&nbsp;deeds w׳ere enrolled between party and party, what facts&nbsp;were deemed worthy of record upon the birth, marriage,&nbsp;and death of royal and noble families; in short, there is&nbsp;little that concerns the naval and military, the civil and&nbsp;ecclesiastical, the legal and diplomatic affairs of the kingdom, which is not to be found upon the yards and yards&nbsp;of parchment which constitute the collection of the close&nbsp;rolls. The origin of the name “ close ” is due to the fact&nbsp;that the documents composing the series, being of a private&nbsp;nature, were despatched closed or sealed up, and were&nbsp;addressed to one or two persons only. The close rolls&nbsp;begin with the reign of John and continue without interruption to the present time. Since the days of Henry&nbsp;VIII. the entries on these rolls are mostly confined to the&nbsp;enrolments of deeds of bargain and sale, wills of papists,&nbsp;recognizances, specifications of new׳ inventions, and other&nbsp;instruments enrolled for safe custody by warrant from the&nbsp;lord chancellor or master of the rolls. Next in importance,&nbsp;and scarcely second in historical interest, is the series of&nbsp;muniments, dating also from King John to the !?resent&nbsp;day, called the patent rolls. Not a subject connected with&nbsp;the history and government of the country but receives&nbsp;illustration from this magnificent collection. Is a castle&nbsp;besieged by the king, a papal interdict removed by royal&nbsp;supplication, a safe-conduct granted to an unpopular prelate, credence allowed to some court witness, grace shown&nbsp;to a rebellious subject, church lands bestow׳ed on begging&nbsp;clergy, negotiations entered into with foreign princes,&nbsp;powers of ambassadors regulated, lands, offices, and wardships granted to public bodies or private persons, titles&nbsp;of nobility created, charters confirmed, proclamations&nbsp;drawn up, licences to hold, sell, and marry, commands to&nbsp;do fealty and homage,—all, whether relating to political,&nbsp;social, ecclesiastical, or commercial life, are to be found&nbsp;recorded on the membranes of the “litterae patentes.”&nbsp;With the exception of a few gaps in the reigns of John&nbsp;and Henry III. the letters-patent extend without break or&nbsp;flaw from the year 1200 to our own day. Unlike the&nbsp;close rolls, they are unsealed and exposed to view, hence&nbsp;their name. The third great class of records belonging&nbsp;to the Court of Chancery consists of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> parliament&nbsp;rolls ”; these, however, are far from being a perfect collection, as many of the documents containing the proceedings&nbsp;of various parliaments are hopelessly lost. The series&nbsp;begins with the 6th Edw׳ard I. and extends, though v׳itli&nbsp;frequent breaks, to Henry YIII. As the journals of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">House of Lords do not commence till the reign of Henry VIII., it is only from the parliament rolls that proof can&nbsp;be obtained of a peer having sat in parliament previous to&nbsp;that period ; such proof is always requisite in claims to an&nbsp;ancient barony by writ. When complete these rolls contain&nbsp;entries of the various transactions which took place from&nbsp;the opening to the close of each parliament. Unfortunately&nbsp;many of the lost rolls belong to those parliaments which&nbsp;are of the greatest importance for the history of the constitution. The enrolments of Acts of Parliament, however,&nbsp;are of considerable help in the investigation of English&nbsp;parliamentary history and constitute a most important supplement to the parliament rolls. They begin with Richard&nbsp;III. and continue to 1849, when enrolments ceased and&nbsp;Acts printed on vellum were substituted. Space forbids&nbsp;us to enter into details respecting the other important&nbsp;collections belonging to the Chancery records. We only&nbsp;allude briefly to the charter rolls, which consist of grants&nbsp;of privileges to religious houses and bodies corporate, and&nbsp;which extend from John to Henry VIII., in which reign&nbsp;grants from the crown were entered on the patent rolls;&nbsp;the coronation rolls, which contain the commissions and&nbsp;proceedings of the commissioners appointed to hear and&nbsp;determine claims of service to be performed at coronations,&nbsp;as well as the oaths taken by the king or queen when&nbsp;crowned,—this collection, with the exception of the coronation rolls of Charles I. and George III., which are&nbsp;wanting, is perfect from James I. to Victoria; the fine&nbsp;rolls, consisting of accounts of fines paid to the king for&nbsp;licences to alienate lands, for freedom from knight service,&nbsp;for pardons, wardships, and the like, which also begin&nbsp;with John and go down to Charles I.; the French and Norman rolls, which relate to transactions in France whilst the&nbsp;English held part of that country; the oblata rolls, consisting of accounts of the offerings and free gifts to the&nbsp;sovereign from his subjects; and the valuable inquisitions&nbsp;post-mortem, frequently but erroneously referred to as&nbsp;escheat rolls, taken on the death of every tenant of the&nbsp;crown. Then in addition to these there are tire hundred&nbsp;rolls, the decree rolls, the royal letters, the carta? antiquae,&nbsp;the privy seals and signet bills, the subsidy rolls, the Irish,&nbsp;Scotch, and Welsh rolls, the Almain rolls, and numerous&nbsp;other classes of document which it is impossible to catalogue or describe within the limits of a general review of&nbsp;the English archives. Suffice it to say that every class&nbsp;of records is carefully arranged for public inspection and&nbsp;that full and clear indices render research a matter of&nbsp;little difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Court of Queeris Bench</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">.—As this court takes cognizance of both civil and criminal causes, the former on the crown&nbsp;side and the latter on the plea side of the court, the records are arranged in the two sections, crown side and&nbsp;plea side. Of these records the most important are the&nbsp;judgment or plea rolls. From the time of Richard I. to&nbsp;the year 1702 they were united with the crown rolls, but&nbsp;at that date they were separated. The plea rolls contain&nbsp;the general proceedings in causes, but the modern rolls&nbsp;are very defective owing to the neglect of attorneys in&nbsp;bringing the records in. The crowm rolls are composed of&nbsp;indictments, informations, and other similar proceedings&nbsp;to which parties have pleaded. Another division of the&nbsp;judgment rolls contains the controlment rolls, which comprise minutes of all the principal proceedings in crown&nbsp;causes, with numerical references to the judgment rolls,&nbsp;where the proceedings are entered at length. Apart from&nbsp;the plea rolls the remaining records of this court are of&nbsp;little general interest. Among their number we may&nbsp;notice the attorney’s oath roll, containing the oaths required to be subscribed by attorneys on their admission,&nbsp;the “baga de secretis,” containing proceedings on attainders</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
