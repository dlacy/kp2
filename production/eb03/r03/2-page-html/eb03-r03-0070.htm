<p><span class="font0">ſhe liable to any amercement in any court. But in general, unleſs where the law has expreſsly declared her exempted, ſhe is upon the ſame footing with other ſub-jects ; being to all intents and purpoſes the king’s ſubject, and not his equal ; in like manner as in the imperial law, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Augujlus legibus ſolutus non eβ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The queen hath alſo ſome pecuniary advantages, which form her a diſtinct revenue : as, in the firſt place,&nbsp;ſhe is intitled to an ancient perquiſite called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">queen-gold,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aurum regime ;</span><span class="font0"> which is a ιoyal revenue belonging&nbsp;to every queen-conſort during her marriage with the&nbsp;king, and due from every perſon wſho hath made a voluntary offering or fine to the king, amounting to 10&nbsp;merks or upwards, for and in conſideration of any privileges, grants, licences, pardons, or other matter of&nbsp;royal favour conferred upon him by the king : and it&nbsp;is due in the proportion to one-tenth part more, over&nbsp;and above the entire offering or fine made to the king,&nbsp;and becomes an actual debt of record to the queen’s&nbsp;majeſty by the mere recording of the fine. As, if rco&nbsp;merks of ſilver be given to the king for liberty to take&nbsp;in mortmain, or to have a fair, market, park, chaſe,&nbsp;or free-warren ; there the queen is intitled to io merks&nbsp;in ſilver, or (what was formerly an equivalent denomination) to one merk in gold, by the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">queen-gold,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aurum regin'æ.</span><span class="font0"> But no ſuch payment is due for&nbsp;any aids or ſubſidies granted to the king in parliament&nbsp;or convocation ; or for fines impoſed by courts on offenders againſt their will ; nor for voluntary preſents&nbsp;to the king, without any conſideration moving from&nbsp;him to the ſubject ; nor for any ſale or contract whereby the preſent revenues or poſſeſſions of the crown are&nbsp;granted away or diminiſhed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The original revenue of our ancient queens, before and ſoon after the conqueſt, ſeems to have conſiſted in&nbsp;certain reſervations or rents out of the demeſne lands&nbsp;of the crown, which were expreſsly appropriated to&nbsp;her majeſty, diſtinct from the king. It is frequent in&nbsp;domeſday book, after ſpecifying the rent due to the&nbsp;crown, to add likewiſe the quantity of gold or other&nbsp;Tenders reſerved to the queen. Theſe were frequently&nbsp;appropriated to particular purpoſes ; to buy wood for&nbsp;her majeſty’s uſe, fo purchaſe oil for lamps, or to fur-niſh her attire from head to foot, which was frequently&nbsp;very coſtly, as one ſingle robe in the fiſth year of&nbsp;Henry II. ſtood the city of London in upwards of 8o&nbsp;pounds : A practice ſomewhat ſimilar to that of the&nbsp;eaſtern countries, where whole cities and provinces were&nbsp;ſpecifically aſſigned to purchaſe particular parts of the&nbsp;queen’s apparel. And for a farther addition to her&nbsp;income, this duty of queen-gold is ſuppoſed to have&nbsp;been originally granted ; thoſe matters of grace and&nbsp;favour, out of which it aroſe, being frequently obtained from the crown by the powerful interceſſion of the&nbsp;queen. There are traces of its payment, though obſcure ones, in the book of domeſday, and in the great&nbsp;pipe-roll of Henry I. In the reign of Henry II. the&nbsp;manner of collecting it appears to have been well underſtood ; and it forms a diſtinct head in the ancient&nbsp;dialogue of the exchequer written in the time of that&nbsp;prince, and uſually attributed to Gervaſe of Tilbury.&nbsp;From that time downwards, it was regularly claimed&nbsp;and enjoyed by all the queen-conſorts of England till&nbsp;the death of Henry VIII. ; though after the acceſſion&nbsp;of the Tudor family, the collecting of it </span><span class="font1">ſeems </span><span class="font0">to have&nbsp;been much neglected : and there being no queen confort&nbsp;afterwards till the acceſſion of James 1. a period of near&nbsp;6o years, its very nature and quantity then became a&nbsp;matter of doubt ; and being referred by the king to&nbsp;the chief juſtices and chief baron, their report of it was&nbsp;ſo very unfavourable, that his confort queen Anne,&nbsp;though ſhe claimed it, yet never thought proper to&nbsp;exact it. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ιf&gt;3ζ&gt;</span><span class="font0"> <sup>11</sup> ^-ar. I. a time fertile of expedients for railing money upon dormant precedents in&nbsp;our old records (of which ſhip-money was a fatal inſtance), the king, at the petition of his queen Henrietta Maria, iffued out his writ for levying it ; but afterwards purchaſed it of his confort at the price of&nbsp;10,000 pounds ; finding it, perhaps, too trifling and&nbsp;troubleſome to levy. And when afterwards, at the&nbsp;Reſtoration, by the abolition of military tenures, and&nbsp;the fines that were conſequent upon them, the little&nbsp;that legally remained of this revenue was reduced to&nbsp;almoſt nothing at all ; in vain did Mr Prynne, by a&nbsp;treatiſe that does honour to his abilities as a painful&nbsp;and judicious antiquarian, endeavour to excite queen&nbsp;Catherine to revive this antiquated claim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another ancient perquiſite belonging to the queen confort, mentioned by all our old writers, and therefore only worthy notice, is this : that on the taking a&nbsp;whale on the coaſts, which is a royal fiſh, it ſhall be divided between the king and queen ; the head only being the king’s property, and the tail of it the queen’s.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De flurgione obſervetur, quod rex ilium babebit integrum :&nbsp;de balena vero ſujſidt, fi rex habeat caput, et regina cau-dam.</span><span class="font0"> The reaſon of this whimſical diviſion, as aſſigned&nbsp;by our ancient records, was, to furniſh the queen’s&nbsp;wardrobe with whale-bone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But farther: though the queen is in all.reſpects a ſubject, yet,· in point of the ſecurity ef her life and&nbsp;perſon, ſhe is put upon the ſame footing with the king.&nbsp;It is equally treaſon (by the ſtatute 25 Edward III.)&nbsp;to imagine or compaſs the death of our lady the king’s&nbsp;companion, as of the king himſelf ; and to violate or&nbsp;defile the queen confort, amounts to the ſame high&nbsp;crime ; as well in the perſon committing the fact, as in&nbsp;the queen herſelf if conſenting. A law of Henry VIII.&nbsp;made it treaſon alſo for any woman who was not a virgin, to marry the king without informing him thereof:&nbsp;but this law was ſoon after repealed ; it treſpaſſing too&nbsp;ſtrongly, as well on natural juſtice as female modeſty.&nbsp;If however the queen be accuſed of any ſpecies of treaſon, ſhe ſhall (whether confort or dowager) be tried by&nbsp;the peers of parliament, as queen Ann Boleyn was </span><span class="font1">in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">28 Hen. VIII.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The huſhand of a queen regnant, as prince George of Denmark was to queen Anne, is her ſubject ; and&nbsp;may be guilty of high treaſon againſt her : but, in the&nbsp;inſtance of conjugal fidelity, he is not ſubjected to the&nbsp;ſame penal reſtrictions. For which the reaſon ſeems to&nbsp;be, that if a queen confort is unfaithful to the royal&nbsp;bed, this may debaſe or baſtardize the heirs to the&nbsp;crown ; but no ſuch danger can be conſequent on the&nbsp;infidelity of the huſhand to a queen regnant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. A queen </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dowager</span><span class="font0"> is the widow of the king, and&nbsp;as ſuch enjoys moſt of the privileges belonging to her&nbsp;as queen confort. But it is not high treaſon to con-ſpire her death, or to violate her chaſtity ; for the ſame&nbsp;reaſon as was before alleged, becauſe the ſucceſſion to&nbsp;the crown is not thereby endangered.
