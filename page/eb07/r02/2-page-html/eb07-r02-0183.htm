<p><span class="font1">The palace of Lucien Bonaparte possesses a small collection, but entirely composed of masterpieces, and kept in beautiful preservation. The Palazzo Nuovo di Torlonia, the residence of Torlonia the Roman banker, who has purchased&nbsp;the title and estate of the Duca di Bracciano, is fitted up&nbsp;with all the magnificence that wealth can command. The&nbsp;gallery is adorned with Canova’s colossal group of Hercules&nbsp;and Lychas. The Farnese palace contains the far-famed&nbsp;gallery painted in fresco by Annibal Caracci.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Vatican has long been celebrated for its unrivalled splendour and magnificence. Its ceilings richly painted in&nbsp;fresco ; its pictured pavements of ancient mosaic ; its magnificent gates of bronze ; its polished columns of ancient porphyry, the splendid spoils of the mins of imperial Rome ;&nbsp;its endless accumulation of Grecian marble, Egyptian granites, and Oriental alabasters; its bewildering extent and&nbsp;prodigality of magnificence; but, above all, its amazing treasures of sculpture, far surpass even the gorgeous dreams of&nbsp;Eastern magnificence.@@<sup>1</sup> In common with all the other collections of the fine arts in Rome, the Vatican suffered materially from the rapacity of the French, but on the downfall&nbsp;of Bonaparte the stolen treasures were restored to their rightful owners. The Vatican contains a museum filled with the&nbsp;most splendid specimens of ancient sculpture;—the tapestry&nbsp;chambers hung with tapestry woven in the looms of Flanders, and copied from the cartoons of Raphael ;—a picture gallery, filled with the masterpieces of painting ;—the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Camere&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Loggie</span><span class="font1"> of Raphael, painted in fresco by himself and his&nbsp;pupils ;—the Sistina and Paolina chapels, painted in fresco by&nbsp;Michael Angelo ;—and the library, the halls and galleries of&nbsp;which alone are more than thirteen hundred feet in length.&nbsp;The view from the balcony in front of the windows gave the&nbsp;name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Belvidere</span><span class="font1"> to the museum, and in consequence to&nbsp;the matchless statue of Apollo Belvidere, pronounced by&nbsp;universal consent to be the finest statue in the world. It&nbsp;was found near Antium, in the ruins of a Roman villa, supposed to have originally belonged to Nero. The name of&nbsp;its artist is unknown. Here, also, is the celebrated group&nbsp;of the Laocoon, which Pliny states to have been executed&nbsp;by Agesander the Rhodian, and Athenodorus and Polidorus,&nbsp;who are believed to have been his sons.@@<sup>2</sup> This wonderful&nbsp;masterpiece was found in the palace of Titus, on the very&nbsp;spot where it is described by Pliny to have stood, and every&nbsp;successive generation that has passed since it was formed,&nbsp;has gazed with admiration on its matchless sublimity. The&nbsp;Vatican also contains the two finest paintings in the world,&nbsp;the Transfiguration by Raphael, and Domenichino’s Communion of St. Jerome. The library contains a splendid collection of books, and is peculiarly rich in rare and valuable manuscripts. But a minute account of the immense treasures of&nbsp;art accumulated in this magnificent building would occupy&nbsp;too much of our space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another of the Pope’s palaces, the Lateran, has been converted into an hospital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The museum of the Capitol contains a very extensive collection of specimens of ancient sculpture. The finest works in it are the famous statue called the Dying Gladiator, found&nbsp;at Antium in the same spot with the Apollo Belvidere and&nbsp;the Fighting Gladiator; the two Furietti Centaurs; the old&nbsp;shrivelled crone, which some have called the Præfica, others&nbsp;a Sybil, others Hecuba ; the group of Cupid and Psyche ;&nbsp;Cupid bending his bow ; the Osiris and Isis ; the professor&nbsp;of the gymnastic art ; the noble seated statue of Agrippina,&nbsp;the wife of Germanicus ; the Camillus ; the child playing with a swan ; the bronze urn which bears the name of&nbsp;Mithridates ; the four doves, a mosaic, which must be either&nbsp;the original or a copy of the famous mosaic of Sosus, in the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">temple of Pergamus, described by Pliny ; and the bas-reliefs of the dispute between Agamemnon and Achilles ; the Nine&nbsp;Muses ; and the battle of the Amazons.@@<sup>3</sup> The Capitol contains also a museum of painting, but it is of very inferior interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The academy of St. Luke, in the Forum, contains Raphael’s famous picture of St. Luke painting the Virgin’s portrait. Here is preserved the skull of Raphael under a glass case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rome contains eleven public libraries, some of which are excellent. In the Augustine convent there is one containing upwards of one hundred thousand volumes, which is open&nbsp;to the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are a great many villas in the immediate vicinity of Rome, and even within its walls. Every villa has at least&nbsp;one building, called a casino, containing a suite of entertaining rooms, fitted up with all the luxury of painting and sculpture. The villa and garden of the Borghese, which are by&nbsp;far the most beautiful pleasure grounds at Rome, arc open&nbsp;as a common drive to the whole metropolis. The villa Lu-dovisi, within the walls of the city, is nearly two miles in circuit. It contains an invaluable collection of celebrated&nbsp;pieces of ancient statuary, of which no copies are known to&nbsp;exist. The magnificent villa Medici, on the Pincian hill,&nbsp;is now converted into the French academy, where a number&nbsp;of young artists of promise are supported at the charge of&nbsp;the French government, with the view of enabling them to&nbsp;enjoy the advantages of a few years study at Rome. The&nbsp;villa Albani is enriched with the most precious collection of&nbsp;ancient sculpture that any private cabinet ever contained.&nbsp;The finest specimens of this collection are the famous Apollo&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sauroctonos,</span><span class="font1"> the most beautiful bronze statue now left in&nbsp;the world, and which, in tlle judgment of Winkelman, is&nbsp;the original of Praxiteles, described by Pliny; the statue of&nbsp;Minerva, which is pronounced by Winkelman to be the&nbsp;only monument now existing at Rome of the sublime age&nbsp;of art that lasted from the age of Phidias to that of Praxiteles ; and the far-famed relievo of Antinous, which, says’&nbsp;Winkelman, “ after the Apollo and the Laocoon, is perhaps&nbsp;the most beautiful monument of antiquity which time has&nbsp;transmitted to us.”@@<sup>4</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The castle of St. Angelo, “ the mole which Hadrian rear’d on high,” was originally called “ Moles Adriani,” from the&nbsp;name of its founder, who destined it to hold his remains for&nbsp;ever. It is a circular building, and was formerly reckoned&nbsp;very strong ; it has stood many sieges, but as a fortress it is&nbsp;wholly untenable against modern tactics. It has been so&nbsp;often taken and retaken, repaired and altered, that but little&nbsp;of the original structure now remains, except the walls. It&nbsp;communicates with the Vatican by a long covered gallery,&nbsp;made by Pope Alexander VI., to afford him a way of escape&nbsp;from the just fury of his subjects. The castle of St. Angelo&nbsp;is now used as a place of confinement for prisoners sentenced&nbsp;to the galleys. The upper part of it also serves as a state&nbsp;prison fbr criminals of rank, and those who fall under the suspicion and displeasure of the Pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The population of Rome, which in 1800 amounted to 153,004, gradually diminished till it was only 117,882 in&nbsp;1813. Since that period, however, it has progressively increased, and in 1836 consisted of 153,678, exclusive of Jews,&nbsp;who amount to 3700. On the dismemberment of the Pontifical territory in 1800, the population of those parts which&nbsp;now form the government was 2,400,000, in 1829 that population had increased to 2,679,524, being an augmentation&nbsp;of about one-eighth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The population returns for the city of Rome in 1836, are thus given by the authorities ;—</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
