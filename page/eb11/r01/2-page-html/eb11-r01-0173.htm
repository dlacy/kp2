In 1791 he went to Paris as deputy to the Legislative Assembly, but after the fall of the&nbsp;Girondists, to whose party he was attached, he had to go&nbsp;into hiding. He was, however, discovered and imprisoned in&nbsp;Paris. During his imprisonment he wrote his play </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Caton d’Utique&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1794). </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Eléonore de Bavières</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les Templiers</span><span class="font1"> were accepted&nbsp;by the Comédie Française. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les Templiers</span><span class="font1"> was produced in 1805,&nbsp;and, in spite of the protests of Geoffroy, had a great success&nbsp;Raynouard was admitted to the Academy in 1807, and from&nbsp;1817 to 1826 he was perpetual secretary. He wrote other&nbsp;plays, in one of which, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les États de Blois</span><span class="font1"> (acted 1810), he gave&nbsp;offence to Napoleon by his freedom of speech, but, realizing&nbsp;that the public taste had changed and that the romanticists&nbsp;were to triumph, he abandoned the stage and gave himself up&nbsp;to linguistic studies. He was admitted to the Academy of&nbsp;Inscriptions in 1815. His researches into the Provençal&nbsp;dialect were somewhat inexact, but his enthusiasm and perseverance promoted the study of the subject. His chief works&nbsp;are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Choix de poésies originales des troubadours</span><span class="font1"> (6 vols., 1816-1821), of which the sixth volume, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Grammaire comparée des&nbsp;langues de l’Europe latine dans leurs rapports avec la langue des&nbsp;troubadours</span><span class="font1"> (1821), was separately published; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lexique roman&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(6 vols., 1838-1844).

Pop.&nbsp;(1906) 13,783, about one-third being Moslems. The railway&nbsp;station is at Inebektchi, 2 m. N. Razgrad possesses a fine&nbsp;mosque, built by Ibrahim Pasha in 1614. Many Turkish&nbsp;families emigrated after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877, but&nbsp;since then the population has again increased, and the town&nbsp;has a thriving agricultural and general trade. Carpet-weaving&nbsp;and viticulture are important local industries. On the 13th&nbsp;of June 1810 and the 14th of August 1877 Razgrad was the&nbsp;scene of battles between the Turks and Russians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAZIN, STEPHEN TIMOFEEVICH (d. 1671), Cossack hetman and rebel, whose parentage and date and place of birth are&nbsp;unknown. We first hear of him in 1661 on a diplomatic mission&nbsp;from the Don Cossacks to the Kalmuck Tatars, and in the same&nbsp;year we meet him on a pilgrimage of a thousand miles to the&nbsp;great Solovetsky monastery on the White Sea “ for the benefit&nbsp;of his soul.’’ After that all trace of him is lost for six years, when&nbsp;he reappears as the leader of a robber community established&nbsp;at Panshinskoe, among the marshes between the rivers Tishina&nbsp;and Ilovlya, from whence he levied blackmail on all vessels&nbsp;passing up and down the Volga. His first considerable exploit&nbsp;was to destroy the “ great water caravan ’’ consisting of the&nbsp;treasury-barges and the barges of the patriarch and the wealthy&nbsp;merchants of Moscow. He then sailed down the Volga with a&nbsp;fleet of thirty-five galleys, capturing the more important forts&nbsp;on his way and devastating the country. At the beginning of&nbsp;1668 he defeated the voivode Jakov Bezobrazov, sent against&nbsp;him from Astrakhan, and in the spring embarked on a predatory&nbsp;expedition into Persia which lasted for eighteen months. Sailing into the Caspian, he ravaged the Persian coasts from Derbend&nbsp;to Baku, massacred the inhabitants of the great emporium of&nbsp;Resht, and in the spring of 1669 established himself on the isle&nbsp;of Suina, off which, in July, he annihilated a Persian fleet sent&nbsp;against him. Stenka,@@<sup>l</sup> as he was generally called, had now&nbsp;become a potentate with whom princes did not disdain to treat.&nbsp;In August 1669 he reappeared at Astrakhan, and accepted a&nbsp;fresh offer of pardon from the tsar there; the common people&nbsp;were fascinated by his adventures. The semi-Asiatic kingdom&nbsp;of Astrakhan, where the whole atmosphere was predatory and&nbsp;nine-tenths of the population were nomadic, was the natural&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">milieu</span><span class="font1"> for such a rebellion as Stenka Razin’s. In 1670 Razin,&nbsp;while ostensibly on his way to report himself at the Cossack&nbsp;headquarters on the Don, openly rebelled against the government, captured Cherkask, Tsaritsyn and other places, and on&nbsp;the 24th of June burst into Astrakhan itself. After massacring</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">all who opposed him, and giving the rich bazaars of the city over to pillage, he converted Astrakhan into a Cossack republic,&nbsp;dividing the population into thousands, hundreds and tens, with&nbsp;their proper officers, all of whom were appointed by a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">vyecha&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or general assembly, whose first act was to proclaim Stephen&nbsp;Timofeevich their </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gosudar</span><span class="font1"> (sovereign). After a three weeks’&nbsp;carnival of blood and debauchery Razin quitted Astrakhan with&nbsp;two hundred barges full of troops to establish the Cossack&nbsp;republic along the whole length of the Volga, as a preliminary&nbsp;step towards advancing against Moscow. Saratov and Samara&nbsp;were captured, but Simbirsk defied all efforts, and after two&nbsp;bloody encounters close at hand on the banks of the Sviyaga&nbsp;(October 1st and 4th), Razin was ultimately routed and fled&nbsp;down the Volga, leaving the bulk of his followers to be extirpated&nbsp;by the victors. But the rebellion was by no means over. The&nbsp;emissaries of Razin, armed with inflammatory proclamations,&nbsp;had stirred up the inhabitants of the modern governments of&nbsp;Nizhmy-Novgorod, Tambov and Penza, and penetrated even so&nbsp;far as Moscow and Great Novgorod. It was not difficult to&nbsp;revolt the oppressed population by the promise of deliverance&nbsp;from their yoke. Razin proclaimed that his object was to root&nbsp;out the boyars and all officials, to level all ranks and dignities,&nbsp;and establish Cossackdom, with its corollary of absolute equality,&nbsp;throughout Muscovy. Even at the beginning of 1671 the issue&nbsp;of the struggle was doubtful. Eight battles had been fought&nbsp;before the insurrection showed signs of weakening, and it&nbsp;continued for six months after Razin had received his quietus.&nbsp;At Simbirsk his prestige had been shattered. Even his own&nbsp;settlements at Saratov and Samara refused to open their gates&nbsp;to him, and the Don Cossacks, hearing that the patriarch of&nbsp;Moscow had anathematized Stenka, also declared against him.&nbsp;In 1671 he was captured at Kagalnik, his last fortress, and&nbsp;carried to Moscow, where, on the 6th of June, after bravely&nbsp;enduring unspeakable torments, he was quartered alive.</span></p>

The&nbsp;typical razor consists of a blade, usually curving slightly backward, folding into a handle, to which it is fastened by a tang and&nbsp;rivet. The back of the blade is thick and the sides are hollowed&nbsp;or slope to the fine edge (see Cutlery). In modem times&nbsp;various forms of safety-razor have been invented, in which the&nbsp;blade fits into a fixed handle with a toothed or comb-like shield&nbsp;which protects the face from cutting.</span></p>
