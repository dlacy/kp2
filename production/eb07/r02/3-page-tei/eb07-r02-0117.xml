The struggle was long and severe ; but at length Tarquinius is said to have obtained possession of it by means of a stratagem, conducted by his son Sextus, similar to that by which Zopyrus gained possession of Babylon for Darius Hystaspis. He turned his arms next against the Volsci, and took Suessa Pometia, where he obtained a very great booty, and retained the tithe of it for his own share.</p><p>Thus powerful and enriched, he next proceeded to finish the great works left incomplete by his predecessors. He finished the cloaca maxima, and prepared to build the temple which his father, during the Sabine war, had vowed to the three great deities, Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva. For this purpose he levelled the brow of the hill, originally called by the Sabines Saturnius, but better known by its subsequent name, the Capitoline hill. In clearing away the ground for the foundation of this temple, a fresh human skull was found ; whence the augurs predicted that Rome should be the capital, or chief city of the world ; whence also the name by which that hill was always subsequently known. The hill had formerly been almost covered with altars and shrines consecrated by the Sabines. Tarquinius inquired by augury whether the deities, to whom these were sacred, would yield their places toJupiter, Juno, and Minerva. Theauguries allowed the removal of all except the shrines ofTerminus and Youth. This was interpreted as itself an omen, that the boundaries of the Roman empire should never recede, and that the state should be for ever young.</p><p>The chief builders of the capitol were Etruscan workmen, whose skill was superior to that of the Romans ; but Tarquinius compelled the Roman commons to work also as labourers, giving them merely a certain supply of provisions daily, as if they were mere slaves. They groaned wearily underneath his heavy yoke, but he ruled them with a high hand, and sent colonies of the most refractory of them to the frontiers of his conquests in the Volscian lands. Under the strong and imperious sway of this haughty, yet able tyrant, Rome reached an extent of territory and a pitch of power greatly beyond what it had ever before attained. There may, however, be the aspect of external greatness, and the reality of internal wretchedness ; but such a state of affairs cannot be permanent.</p><p>Hitherto, the narrative diverges little from the plain course of what was, or might have been, historical truth ; and it is not undeserving of remark, that the conduct of Tarquinius Superbus is very natural for a prince who retained much of the Etruscan notions respecting hereditary rights, and scorn of the lower classes. The plan of employing the plebs in task-work, without any other support than a scanty allowance of food, might have been brought from the Nile, as easily as from Etruria ; and is some corroboration of the theory which would bring the hereditary half priest half noble caste of Lucumones from Egypt.</p><p>About this time the strange story ofthe Sibyl is told. An unknown woman, of foreign aspect and manners, came to the king and offered him nine books of prophecies, for which she demanded a large sum. The king refused. The woman departed, burnt three of the books, and then returned and demanded the same sum for the remaining six. The king still refused ; and again the woman went away, burnt three, and returning, demanded the same price as at the first. Struck by this strange conduct, Tarquinius consulted the augurs, who told him that it was essential to the safety of Rome to procure the books. Accordingly he purchased them, and the woman departed, and was seen no more. These Sibylline books were then deposited in a chest of stone, and entrusted to the charge of two men of the highest rank, who kept them under ground in the Capitol. Their contents were never divulged ; nor were they ever consulted, except by a decree of the senate, and in times of the greatest public danger and distress.</p><p>But the tyranny of Tarquinius had now nearly reached its limits. Various portents foreshewed its approaching overthrow. According to the legend, the first indications of the coming doom were seen in an unnatural violation of the sacred rites. A huge snake crawled out from an altar in the court of the palace, in the time of sacrifice ; the fire suddenly died out, and the snake devoured the victim. To ascertain what this prodigy portended, the king sent two of his sons to consult the oracle of Apollo at Delphi. They took with them their cousin, Lucius Junius Brutus, who had been brought up along with them in the palace, disregarded on account of his apparent apathy of manner, and laughed at as almost half an idiot. He was the younger son of a sister of Tarquinius by Marcus Junius ; and his elder brother had been put to death by his uncle for his wealth. To escape a similar fate he had feigned idiocy, and was consequently spared and despised. So runs the legend, to account for the name Brutus ; which, however, in old Latin is nearly synonymous with Severus, and may have been given him merely on account of his reserved gravity of manner. The answer of the Delphic oracle was, that the king should fall when a dog should speak with a human voice. This response was of course intended secretly to apply to Brutus, and his unexpected display of mental ability. The young princes also asked which of the king’s sons should succeed him ; and were answered in general terms, that the regal power should be enjoyed by the person who should first salute his mother. Brutus, as they were departing, stumbled, fell, and kissed tlle earth, thus fulfilling the meaning of the oracle.</p><p>Soon after this event, Tarquinius waged war against Ardea of the Rutuli, a people on the coast of Latium. The city was very strong both by nature and art, and made a protracted resistance. The army lay encamped around the walls, in order to reduce it by hunger, since they could not by direct force. While lying half idle at Ardea, the princes and their kinsmen, Brutus and Collatinus, happening to feast together, began in their gaiety to boast each of the beauty and virtue of his wife. Collatinus extolled his wife Lucretia as beyond all rivalry. On a sudden they resolved to ride to Rome and decide the dispute by ascertaining which of the respective ladies was spending her time in the most becoming and laudable manner. They found the wives of the king’s sons entertaining other noble ladies with a costly banquet. They then rode on to Collatia ; and though it was near midnight, they found Lucretia with her handmaids around her working at tbe loom. It was admitted that Lucretia was the most worthy lady ; and they returned again to the camp at Ardea.</p><p>But the beauty and virtue of Lucretia had excited in the base heart of Sextus Tarquinius tlle fire of lawless passion. After a few days he returned to Collatia, where he was hospitably entertained by Lucretia as a kinsman of her husband. At midnight be secretly entered her chamber ; end when persuasions were ineffectual, he threatened to kill her and one of her male slaves, and laying the body by her side, to declare to Collatinus that he had slain her in the act of adultery. The dread of a disgrace to her memory, from which there should be no possible mode of wiping away the stain, produced an effect which the fear of death could not have done ; an effect not unnatural in a heathen, who might dread the disgrace of a crime more than its commission, but which shews the conventional morality and virtue of the time, how ill-founded, and almost weakly sentimental, in even that boasted instance of female virtue. Having accomplished his wicked purpose, Sextus again returned to the camp.</p><p>Immediately after his departure, Lucretia sent for her husband and father. Collatinus came from the camp accompanied by Brutus ; and her father, Lucretius, from the city, along with Publius Valerius. They found Lucretia sitting on her bed, weeping and inconsolable.
