<p><span class="font2">to their weight far higher in the. smaller ones. In a mouse or small bird, for instance, thc rate is about twenty times as great&nbsp;as in a man. The difference is in part due to the fact that thc&nbsp;smaller an animal is the greater is its surface relatively to its&nbsp;mass, and consequently the more heat does it require to keep&nbsp;up its temperature. The smaller animal must therefore produce&nbsp;more heat. Even in cold-blooded animals, however, oxidation</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">' appears to be more rapid the smaller the animal. In the case of man, oxidation is rclatively more than twice as rapid in&nbsp;children than in adults, and the difference is greater than would&nbsp;be accounted for by the difference in the ratio of surface to mass.&nbsp;Allowing for differences in size, oxidation is about equally rapid&nbsp;in men and women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was for long believed that the special function of respiratory oxidation was (i) the production of heat, and (2) the destruction&nbsp;of the supposed “ waste products.” Further investigation has,&nbsp;however, tended to show more and more clearly that in reality&nbsp;respiratory oxidation is an essential and intimate accompaniment of all vital activity. To take one example, secretion and&nbsp;absorption, which were formerly explained as simple processes&nbsp;of filtration and diffusion, are now known to be* accompanied,&nbsp;and necessarily so, by respiratory oxidation in the tissues concerned. The respiratory oxidation of an animal is thus a very&nbsp;direct index of the activity of its vital processes as a whole.&nbsp;Looking at what is known with regard to respiratory oxidation,&nbsp;we see that what is most striking and most characteristic in&nbsp;it is its tendency to persist—to remain on the whole at about&nbsp;a normal level for each animal, or each stage of development&nbsp;of an animal. The significance of this cannot be over-estimated.&nbsp;It indicates clearly that just as an organism differentiates itself&nbsp;from any non-living material system by the manner in which&nbsp;it actually asserts and maintains its specific anatomical structure,&nbsp;so does it differentiate itself from any mere mechanism by the&nbsp;manner in which it asserts and maintains its specific physiological&nbsp;activities.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">(3) </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Movements of Respiration</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Normal Respiration.—</span><span class="font2">If the naked body of a person asleep or in perfect inactivity be carefully watched, it will be found&nbsp;that the anterior and lateral walls of the chest move rhythmically up and down, while air passes into and out of the nostrils&nbsp;(and mouth also if this be open) in correspondence with the&nbsp;movement. If we look more closely wc shall find that with&nbsp;every uprising of the chest walls the membranous intercostal&nbsp;portions sink slightly as if sucked in, while at the same time&nbsp;the flexible walls of the abdomen bulge as if protruded by some&nbsp;internal force. If respiration be in the slightest degree hurried,&nbsp;these motions become so marked as to escape the attention of&nbsp;no one. The elevation of the chest walls is called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">inspiration,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">their depression </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">expiration.</span><span class="font2"> Inspiration is slightly shorter&nbsp;than expiration, and usually there is a slight pause or momentary&nbsp;inaction of the chest between expiration and the following&nbsp;inspiration. Apparatuses for measuring the excursion of a&nbsp;given point of the chest wall during respiration are called&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bioracometers</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Stethometers.</span><span class="font2"> Apparatuses for recording the&nbsp;movements of the chest are called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Stethographs</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pneumographs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Frequency of Respiration.—</span><span class="font2">The frequency of respiration</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">during perféct rest of thc body is 16 to 24 per minute, the pulse rate being usually four times the rate of respiration;&nbsp;but the respiratory rhythm varies in various conditions of&nbsp;life. The following are the means of many observations made&nbsp;by Lambert Adolphe Quételet (1796-1874): at the age of one&nbsp;year the number of respirations is 44 per minute; at 5&nbsp;years, 26; from 15 to 20 years, 20; from 25 to 30, 16; from&nbsp;30 to 50, 18·i. Muscular exertion always increases the frequency of respiration. The higher the temperature of the&nbsp;environment the more frequent is the respiration. Paul Bert&nbsp;(1833-1886) has shown that with higher atmospheric pressures&nbsp;than the normal the frequency of respiration is diminished&nbsp;while the depth of each inspiration is increased. The frequency&nbsp;of respiration diminishes until dinner-time, reaches its maximum&nbsp;within an hour of feeding, and thereafter falls again ; if dinner&nbsp;is^omitted, no rise of frequency occurs. The respiratory act&nbsp;can be interrupted at any stage, reversed, quickened, slowed&nbsp;and variously modified at will, so long as respiration is not&nbsp;stopped entirely for more than a short space of time; beyond&nbsp;this limit the will is incapable of suppressing respiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Depth of Respiration.—</span><span class="font2">The depth of respiration is measured by the quantity of air inspired or expired in the act; but&nbsp;the deepest expiration possible does not suffice to expel all&nbsp;the air the lungs contain. The following measurements have&nbsp;been ascertained, and are here classified according to the convenient terminology proposed by John Hutchinson (1811-1861).&nbsp;(1) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Residual air,</span><span class="font2"> the volume of air remaining in the chest&nbsp;after the most complete expiratory effort, ranges from 100&nbsp;to 130 cub. in. (2) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reserve</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">supplemental air,</span><span class="font2"> the&nbsp;volume of air which can be expelled from the chest after&nbsp;an ordinary quiet expiration, measures about 100 cub. in.&nbsp;(3) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tidal air,<sup>{</sup></span><span class="font2">  the volume of air taken in and given out at&nbsp;each ordinary respiration may be stated at about 20 cub.&nbsp;in. (4) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Complemental air,</span><span class="font2"> the volume of air that can be&nbsp;forcibly inspired over and above what is taken in at a normal&nbsp;inspiration, ranges from about 100 to 130 cub. in. By&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vital capacity, \</span><span class="font2"> which once had an exaggerated importance&nbsp;attached to it, is meant the quantity of air which can be expelled from the lungs by the deepest possible expiration after&nbsp;the deepest possible inspiration; it obviously includes the&nbsp;complemental, tidal and reserve airs, and measures about&nbsp;230 cub. in. in the EngHshman of average height, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">5 ft. 8 in. (Hutchinson). It varies according to the height,&nbsp;body weight, age, sex, position of the body and condition as to&nbsp;health of the subject of observation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Vital capacity is estimated by means of </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">spirometer,</span><span class="font2"> a graduated gasometer into which air may be blown from the lungs. The residual air, which for obvious reasons cannot be actually&nbsp;measured, may be estimated in the following way (Emil Harless,'&nbsp;1820-1862; Louis Gréhant, b. 1838). At the end of ordinary&nbsp;expiration, apply the mouth to a mouthpiece communicating&nbsp;with a vessel filled with pure hydrogen, and breathe into and&nbsp;out of this vessel half a dozen times—until, in fact, there is&nbsp;reason to suppose that the air in the lungs at the time of the&nbsp;experiment has become evenly mixed with hydrogen. Then&nbsp;ascertain by analysis the proportion of hydrogen to expired&nbsp;air in the vessel and estimate the amount of the air which the&nbsp;lungs contained by the following formula:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">υ</span><span class="font2"> : V+î) = ÿ : 100 ; <sub>ν</sub>_</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">ρ(ιοο-^)</span><span class="font2">_</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ρ '</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2">where V=volume of air in the lungs at the time of experiment, Ti=Volume of the vessel containing hydrogen, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">p=</span><span class="font2">proportion of&nbsp;air to hydrogen in the vessel at the end of the experiment. V,&nbsp;then, is the volufne of air in the lungs after an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ordinary</span><span class="font2"> expiration; that is, it includes the residual and the reserve air; if&nbsp;we subtract from this the amount of reserve air ascertained&nbsp;by direct measurement, we obtain the 100-130 cub. in. which&nbsp;Hutchinson arrived at by a study of the dead body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Volume of Respiration.—</span><span class="font2">It is clear that the ventilation of the lungs in ordinary breathing does not merely depend on</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
