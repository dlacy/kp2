<p><span class="font1">(2) The two chief notes of the next period are superstition and&nbsp;scepticism: both the populace and the educated classes lose faith&nbsp;in the old religion, but they supply its place in different&nbsp;ways. The disasters of the early part of the second&nbsp;Punic War revealed an unparalleled religious nervousness:&nbsp;portents and prodigies were announced from all quarters, it was&nbsp;felt that the divine anger was on the state, yet there was no belief&nbsp;in the efficacy of the old methods for restoring the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pax deum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Accordingly recourse is had, under the direction of the Sibylline books, to new forms of appeal for the divine help, the general vowing&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ver sacrum</span><span class="font1"> and the elaborate Greek </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lectisternium</span><span class="font1"> after Trasimene&nbsp;in 217 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.,</span><span class="font1"> and the human sacrifice in the forum after Cannae in&nbsp;the following year. The same spirit continues to show itself in the&nbsp;almost reckless introduction of Greek deities even within the walls of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pomoerium</span><span class="font1"> and their ready identification with gods of the old&nbsp;religion, whose cult they in reality superseded. Thus we hear of&nbsp;temples dedicated to Juvcntas ^Hcbe (101 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.),</span><span class="font1"> Diana=Artemis&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(179 n.c.), </span><span class="font1">Mars = Arcs (138 </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">B.c.), </span><span class="font1">and find even such unexpected&nbsp;identifications as that of the Bona Dea </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font1">—a cult title of the&nbsp;ancient Fauna, the female counterpart ot the countryside </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">numen&nbsp;Faunus—</span><span class="font1">with a Greek goddess of women, Damia. At the same&nbsp;time the new acquaintance with Greek art introduces the making&nbsp;of cult statues, in which the identified Greek type is usually adopted&nbsp;without change, with such curious results as the representation 01 the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Penates</span><span class="font1"> under the form of the Dioscuri. But more significant still&nbsp;was the order of the Sibylline books in 206 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font1"> for the introduction&nbsp;of the worship of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Magna Mater(sce </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Great Mother of the Gods)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">from Pessinus and her ultimate installation on the Palatine in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">191 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font1"> : the door was thus opened to the wilder and more orgiastic&nbsp;cults of Greece and the Orient, which at once laid hold on the&nbsp;popular mind. In the train of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Magna Mater</span><span class="font1"> came the secret&nbsp;cult of Bacchus, which grew to such proportions in&nbsp;private worship that it had to be suppressed by decree of&nbsp;the Senate in 186 </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">B.C., </span><span class="font1">and later on were established the&nbsp;cults of Ma of Phrygia, introduced by Sulla and identified with</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Bellona, the Egyptian Isis, and, after Pompey’s war with the pirates, even the Persian Mithras (g.r.). In all these more emotional rituals,&nbsp;the populace sought expression for the religious emotions which&nbsp;were not satisfied by the cold worship of the older deities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Meanwhile a corresponding change was taking place in the attitude of the educated classes owing to the spread of Greek&nbsp;literature. The knowledge of Greek mythology, to which they were&nbsp;thus introduced, set poets and antiquarians at work in a field wholly&nbsp;foreign to the Roman religious spirit, the task of creating a Roman&nbsp;anthropomorphic mythology. This they accomplished partly, by&nbsp;the popular process of adoption and identification, partly by imitative creation. In this way grew up the “ religion of the poets,&quot;&nbsp;whose falseness and shallowness was patent even to contemporary&nbsp;thinkers. But more important was the influence of philosophy,&nbsp;which led soon enough to a general scepticism among the upper&nbsp;classes. Its first note is struck by Ennius in his translation of the&nbsp;Sicilian rationalist Euhemerus, who explained the genesis&nbsp;of the gods as apotheosized mortals. In the last century&nbsp;of the Republic the two later Greek schools of Epicureanism and Stoicism laid hold on Roman society. The influence of&nbsp;Epicureanism was wholly destructive to religion, but not perhaps&nbsp;very widespread: Stoicism became the creed of the educated classes&nbsp;and produced several attempts, notably those of Scaevola and&nbsp;Varro, at a reconciliation of philosophy and popular religion, in&nbsp;which it was maintained that the latter was in itself untrue, but a&nbsp;presentation of a higher truth suited to the capacity of the popular&nbsp;mind. Such a theory was bound to be fatal, as it makes religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">at once a mere instrument of statecraft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The result on. the old religion was twofold. On the one hand, worship passed into formalism and formalism into disuse. Some&nbsp;of the old cults passed away altogether, others survived in name and&nbsp;form, but were so wholly devoid of inner meaning that even the&nbsp;learning of a Varro could not tell their intention or the character of&nbsp;the deity with whom they were concerned. The old priesthood, and&nbsp;in particular the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">flaminia,</span><span class="font1"> came to be regarded as tiresome restrictions on political life and were neglected: from 87 to 11 B.c. the&nbsp;office of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">flamen Dialis</span><span class="font1"> was vacant. On the other hand, as the result in&nbsp;part of the theory of Stoicism, religion passed into the hands of&nbsp;the politicians: cults were encouraged or suppressed from political&nbsp;motives, the membership of the colleges of pontifices and augurs,&nbsp;now conferred by popular vote, was sought for its social and political&nbsp;advantages, and augury was debased till it became the meanest tool&nbsp;of the politician. In the general wreck of the old religion, little&nbsp;survived but the household cult, protected by its own genuineness&nbsp;and vitality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(3) The revival of Augustus, which marks the opening of the last&nbsp;stage, was perhaps the most remarkable phenomenon in the whole&nbsp;story. It was no doubt very largely political, a part of his plan&nbsp;for the general renaissance of Roman life, which was to centre no&nbsp;longer round the abstract notion of the state, but round the persons&nbsp;of an imperial house. But it was genuinely religious, in&nbsp;that he saw that no revival could be effective which did&nbsp;not appeal to the deeper sentiments of the populace. It&nbsp;was thus his business to revitalize the old forms with a new and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">more vigorous content. His new palace on the Palatine he intended to be primarily the seat of the Julian family and the cults associated&nbsp;with it, and secondarily the centre of the new popular religion.&nbsp;With this object he consecrated there his new temple of Apollo&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(28 B.C.), </span><span class="font1">associated for long with the Julian house, and adopted by&nbsp;Augustus as his special patron at Actium, and transferred to its&nbsp;keeping the Sibylline books, thus marking the new headquarters of&nbsp;the Graeco-Roman religion. Similar in purpose was his institution&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ludi saeculares</span><span class="font1"> in 17 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.,</span><span class="font1"> in which a day celebration was&nbsp;added to the old&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Apollo and Diana deliberately set up</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">as a counterpart to the Capitoline Jupiter and Juno: Horace's hymn written for the festival is a good epitome of Augustus's&nbsp;religious intentions. In the same spirit he established a new shrine&nbsp;of Vesta Augusta within the palace, a private, cult at first, but&nbsp;destined to be a serious rival of the ancient worship in the forum. A&nbsp;still more marked action was the building of a great temple at the&nbsp;end of his own new forum to Mars Ultor,—Mars, the ancestor of the&nbsp;Julian </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens,</span><span class="font1"> as of the Roman people itself, and now to be worshipped&nbsp;as the avenger of Caesar’s murderers. Nor did he hesitate to avail&nbsp;himself of the popular outburst, which immediately after the murder&nbsp;had consecrated the site of Caesar’s cremation with a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bustum,</span><span class="font1"> to&nbsp;erect on the spot a permanent temple to his adopted father, under the&nbsp;definitely religious title of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">divus Julius.</span><span class="font1"> No doubt he also did much&nbsp;generally to revive the ancient cults: he rebuilt, as he tells us&nbsp;himself, eighty-two temples which had fallen into disrepair, he&nbsp;re-established the old priesthoods, filling once more the office of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">flamen Dialis</span><span class="font1"> and reviving such bodies as the Sodales Titii (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Titus Tatius)</span><span class="font1"> and the Arvai Brothers </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.);</span><span class="font1"> but the newrevival&nbsp;attached itself primarily to these four cults, and their tendency was&nbsp;unmistakable. Originally, no doubt,. Augustus designed to attract&nbsp;religious feeling generally to the reigning house, but it was inevitable&nbsp;that the more personal note should be given to it. The deification&nbsp;of Julius Caesar was one important step: another was the natural&nbsp;prominence in the palace of the cult of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Genius</span><span class="font1"> of the emperor&nbsp;himself. As the palace cults became national, the worship of the&nbsp;Genius was bound to spread, and ultimately Augustus sanctioned&nbsp;its celebration at the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">compila</span><span class="font1"> together with the worship of the old&nbsp;Lares. But here he and the wiser of his successors drew the line,&nbsp;and though under oriental influence divine honours were paid to the&nbsp;living emperor outside Italy, they were never permitted officially&nbsp;in Rome.. In the succeeding centuries Augustus’s intentions were&nbsp;realized with a fullness which he would hardly have wished, and the&nbsp;cult of the imperial house practically superseded the state religion&nbsp;as the official form of worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With this last period the story of Roman religion really draws to a close. For, though the form of the old cults was long&nbsp;preserved and even Antoninus Pius was honoured in an inscription for his care of the ancient rites of religion, the vital&nbsp;spirit was almost gone. In the popular mind the hosts of&nbsp;exciting oriental cults, which in the 3rd and 4th centuries of&nbsp;the Empire filled Rome with the rites of mysticism and initiation, held undisputed sway; and with the more educated a&nbsp;revived philosophy, less accurate perhaps in thought, but&nbsp;more satisfying to the religious conscience, gave men a clearer&nbsp;monotheistic conception, and a notion of individual relations&nbsp;with the divine in prayer and even of consecration. It was&nbsp;with these elements—fiercely antagonistic because so closely&nbsp;allied in character—that the battle of Christianity was really&nbsp;fought, and though, after its official adoption, the old religion&nbsp;lingered on as “ paganism ” and died hard at the end, it was&nbsp;really doomed from the moment when the Augustan revival&nbsp;had taken its irrecoverable bias in the direction of the emperor-worship.</span></p>
