<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">roader.</span><span class="font1"> A </span><span class="font0">ſhip is rarely ſaid to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ride</span><span class="font0"> when ſhe is ſaſten-ed at both the ends, as in a harbour or river, that ſitua-tion being comprehended in the article MooRing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Riding, a diſtrict viſited by an officer.—Yorkſhire is divided into three ridings, viz. the eaſt, weft, and north&nbsp;ridings. In all indictments in that county, both the&nbsp;town and riding muſt be expreſſed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Riding, as connected with gardening, and ſuſcep-tſhle of embelliſhment. See Gardening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A riding, though in extent differing ſo widely from a garden, yet agrees with it in many particulars : for,&nbsp;excluſive of that community of character which reſults&nbsp;from their being both improvements, and both deſtined&nbsp;to pleaſure, a cloſer relation ariſes from the property&nbsp;of a riding, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">to extend the idea of a ſeat</span><span class="font0"> and appropriate&nbsp;a whole country to the manſion ; for which purpoſe it&nbsp;muſt be diſtinguiſhed from common roads, and the marks&nbsp;of diſtinction muſt be borrowed from a garden. Thoſe&nbsp; which a farm or a park can ſupply are faint and few ;&nbsp;but whenever circumſtances belonging to a garden occur, they are immediately received as evidence of the&nbsp;domain. The ſpecies of the trees will often be deci-ſive : plantations of firs, whether placed on the ſides&nbsp;of the way, or in clumps or woods in the view, denote&nbsp;the neighbourhood of a ſeat : even limes and horſe-cheſ-nuts are not indifferent ; for they have always been frequent in improvements, and rare in the ordinary ſcenes&nbsp;of cultivated nature. If the riding be carried through&nbsp;a wood, the ſhrubs, which for their beauty or their&nbsp;fragrance have been tranſplanted from the country into gardens, ſuch as the ſweet-briar, .the viburnum, the&nbsp;euonymus, and the wood-bine, ſhould be encouraged&nbsp;in the underwood ; and to theſe may be added ſeveral&nbsp;which are ſtill peculiar to ihrubberies, but which might&nbsp;eaſily be transferred to the wildeſt coverts, and would</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">require no further care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Where the ſpecies are not, the diſpoſition may be particular, and any appearance of deſign is a mark of&nbsp;improvement. A few trees ſtanding out from a hedgerow, raiſe it to an elegance above common ruſticity :&nbsp;and ſtill more may be done by clumps in a field ; they&nbsp;give it the air of a park. A cloſe lane may be decorated with plantations in all the little vacant ſpaces :&nbsp;and even the groups originally on the ſpot (whether&nbsp;it be a wood, a field, or a lane), if properly ſelected,&nbsp;and thoſe only left which are elegant, will have an effect : though every beauty of this kind may be found&nbsp;in nature, yet many of them are ſeldom ſeen together,&nbsp;and never unmixed. The number and the choice are&nbsp;ſymptoms of deſign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another ſymptom is variety. If the appendages of the riding be different in different fields, if in a lane, or&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">wood, ſome diſtinguiſhing circumſtance be provided&nbsp;for every bend ; or when, carried ever an open expo-ſure, it winds to ſeveral points of view ; if this be the&nbsp;conduct throughout, the intention is evident, to amuſe&nbsp;the length of the way : variety of ground is alio a&nbsp;eharacteriſtic of a riding, when it ſeems to have proceeded from choice ; and pleaſure being the pursuit,&nbsp;the changes of the ſcene both compenſate and account&nbsp;for the circuity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But apart undiſtinguiſhed from a common road, ſuc-ceeding to others more adorned, will by the contraſt alone be ſometimes agreeable ; and there are beauties&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">frequent in the high-way, and almoſt </span><span class="font0">peculiar </span><span class="font1">to </span><span class="font0">it,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">which may be very acceptable in a riding : a green lane is always delightful; a paſſage winding between thickets&nbsp;of brambles and briars, ſometimes with ſometimes without a little ſpring-wood riſing amongſt them, or a cut&nbsp;in a continued ſweep through the furze of a down or&nbsp;the fern of a heath, is generally pleaſant. Nor will&nbsp;the character be abſolutely loſt in the interruption, it&nbsp;will ſoon be reſumed, and never forgotten ; when it&nbsp;has been once ſtrongly impreſſed, very flight means&nbsp;will preſerve the idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Simplicity may prevail the whole length of the way when the way is all naturally pleaſant, but eſpecially&nbsp;if it be a communication between ſeveral ſpots, which&nbsp;in character are railed above the reſt of the country :&nbsp;A fine open grove is unuſual, except in a park or a&nbsp;garden ; it has an elegance in the diſpoſition which&nbsp;cannot be attributed to accident, and it ſeems to require a degree of preſervation beyond the care of mere&nbsp;huſhandry. A neat railing on the edge of a ſteep which&nbsp;commands a proſpect, alone diſtinguiſhes that from&nbsp;other points of view. A building is ſtill more ſtrongly&nbsp;characteriſtic : it may be only ornamental, or it may&nbsp;be accommodated to the reception of company ; for&nbsp;though a place to alight at interrupts the range of a&nbsp;riding, yet, as the object of an airing, it may often&nbsp;be acceptable. A ſmall ſpot which may be kept by&nbsp;the labour of one man, incloſed from the fields, and&nbsp;converted into a ſhrubbery or any other ſcene of a garden, will ſometimes be a pleaſing end to a ſhort excur-ſion from home : nothing ſo effectually extends the idea&nbsp;of a ſeat to a diſtance ; and not being conſtantly viſited,&nbsp;it will always retain the charms of novelty and variety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When a riding is carried along a high road, a kind of property may in appearance be claimed even there,&nbsp;by planting on both ſidcs trees equidiſtant from each&nbsp;other, to give it the air of an approach : regularity&nbsp;intimates the neighbourhood of a manſion. A village&nbsp;therefore ſeems to be within the domain, if any of the&nbsp;inlets to it are avenues : other formal plantations about&nbsp;it, and ſtill more trivial circumſtances, when they are&nbsp;evidently ornamental, ſometimes produce and always&nbsp;corroborate ſuch an effect ; but even without railing&nbsp;this idea, if the village be remarkable for its beauty,&nbsp;or only for its Angularity, a paſſage through it may be&nbsp;an agreeable incident in a riding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſame ground which in the fields is no more than rough, often ſeems to be romantic when it is the ſite of&nbsp;a village ; the buildings and other circumſtances mark&nbsp;and aggravate the irregularity. To ſtrengthen this&nbsp;appearance, one cottage may be placed on the edge&nbsp;of a ſteep, and ſome winding ſteps of unhewn ſtonelead&nbsp;up to the door ; another in a hollow, with all its little&nbsp;appurtenances hanging above it. The poſition of a few&nbsp;trees will ſometimes anſwer the ſame purpoſe ; a footbridge here and there for a communication between the&nbsp;ſides of a narrow dip, will add to the character ; and&nbsp;if there be any rills, they may be conducted ſo as greatly to improve it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A village which has not theſe advantages of ground, may, however, be beautiful ; it is diſtinguiſhed by its&nbsp;elegance, when the larger intervals between the houſes&nbsp;are filled with open groves, and little clumps are introduced upon other occaſions. The church often is,&nbsp;it generally may be, made a pictureſque object. Even&nbsp;the cottages may be neat and ſometimes grouped</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
