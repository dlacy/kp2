<p><span class="font0">broke with two tons, and by our rule we find that it ought to carry with safety one ton eleven hundredweight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The following rule may also be of use. To find the weight in pounds of a foot in length of any hempen rope,&nbsp;multiply the square of the circumference in inches by 0∙04∙5&nbsp;for shroud-laid ropes, and by 0∙027 for cables. (b. s.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rope-making is the art of combining fibrous materials, by twisting in such a manner as to form a continuous flexible cord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have before stated, that the fibres used for this purpose are those of flax and hemp ; the former for small lines and cords only, and the latter for all kinds of cords, from&nbsp;the smallest to the largest. The preparation and manufacture of hemp and flax into such articles as either are adapted for, being the same in both, we mean, in the following&nbsp;sketch of these operations, to speak of hemp as the material made use of. This article we obtain from Riga and&nbsp;St Petersburg, whence it is shipped for our ports in great&nbsp;bundles, weighing, according to quality, from forty-five to&nbsp;sixty-five poods each, the pood being equal to thirty-six&nbsp;pounds avoirdupois. On the arrival of the vessels, these&nbsp;great bundles are cut up, and the hemp is thrown from the&nbsp;hold in small bundles, bound at one end, and weighing each&nbsp;about twelve pounds. These small bundles are termed heads ;&nbsp;and in this condition the rope-manufacturer gets his raw&nbsp;material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The fibres of hemp, of a good quality, should be long, fine, and thin ; smooth and glossy on the surface ; of a yellowish-green colour ; and free from spills or small pieces of&nbsp;the boon or woody fibre of the hemp plant, which remain&nbsp;after the operation of breaking ; and they should, above all,&nbsp;possess the essential qualities of strength and toughness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hemp loses many of its good qualities by lying long in warehouses ; and when shipped in a damp state it loses its&nbsp;glossy appearance, becomes what is termed rusted, and is&nbsp;then much weaker, and hard and disagreeable to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The operations of the rope-maker are carried on in the following order, viz.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1st, Hackling the hemp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2dly, Spinning or twisting the fibres into threads or yarns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3dly, Tarring the yarns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4thly, Making the yarn into strands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5thly, Laying or forming the strands into ropes, called hawser-laid ropes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">6thly, Laying or forming hawser-laid ropes into cable-laid ropes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ls∕, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hackling.—</span><span class="font0">To prepare the fibres for the use of the spinner, they are drawn over pronged instruments called&nbsp;hackles, which clear from them the refuse, and split them&nbsp;into different degrees of fineness, to suit the size of thread&nbsp;into which they are to be spun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fig. 1 is a representation of a hackle of the largest kind, called a cag. Here </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aa</span><span class="font0"> is a strong board; and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bb</span><span class="font0"> steel&nbsp;prongs, polished and tapered, and made very sharp at the&nbsp;point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The prongs </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">the next size of hackle are smaller&nbsp;and closer set, and so on,&nbsp;diminishing to the finest&nbsp;size, which reduces the&nbsp;fibres to the last degree&nbsp;of tenuity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The operation of hackling is performed in the following manner. The&nbsp;operator stands at a convenient distance in front of the&nbsp;hackles, which are fixed on a steady bench at a proper&nbsp;height. He then takes a bundle of hemp, and divides it&nbsp;into such portions as he can conveniently grasp. One of&nbsp;these he holds firmly by one end, and draws it over the&nbsp;hackle, beginning with tile end of the bunch farthest from&nbsp;his hand, and by repeated operations disentangles and splits&nbsp;the fibres nearly to where he grasps the bunch. He then&nbsp;takes hold of the finished end, and operates on the part&nbsp;which he before had grasped. To facilitate these operations,&nbsp;he from time to time oils the hemp with a little whale-oil.&nbsp;When the hemp is combed out and split as perfectly as the&nbsp;first size of hackle enables the workman to do, he carries it,&nbsp;if it be necessary for the purpose intended, to the next in&nbsp;degree, and so on to the last. The short fibres which are&nbsp;pulled out of the bunch by the hackle, and remain sticking&nbsp;to it, are collected from time to time by the workman, as&nbsp;they impede his progress, and are laid aside. They are afterwards drawn over the hackle to lay the fibres straight, and&nbsp;are, under the name of tow, used, in making inferior ropes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As the workman finishes his handfuls of hemp, he lays them aside in bundles for the spinner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The operation of hackling would seem to require little skill on the part of the workman ; but this is by no means&nbsp;the case, as bad workmanship would convert the greater&nbsp;part of the hemp into tow. Hackling is performed in a&nbsp;house, which ought, for convenience, to be near to where&nbsp;the threads are spun, that the spinners be not put to unnecessary expense of time in getting their stuff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">'i.dly, Spinning.—</span><span class="font0">The place where the operation of spinning is carried on, is one division of a walk or alley termed the rope-walk, and is generally enclosed by walls, and roofed over ; and in some places where ropes and twine are made,&nbsp;the building is in two stories, the rope-yarns being spun&nbsp;below, and the twine in the loft above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The walk for rope-yarns is, according to circumstances, from 600 to 1200 feet long, and the width is regulated by&nbsp;the extent of the business to be carried on. One end of&nbsp;the walk is termed the head or fore-end, and the other the&nbsp;foot or back-end ; at both ends the machines for communicating twist to the yarns are erected ; and along both sides&nbsp;of the walk, at equal distances, and opposite to each other,&nbsp;are erected posts. Between every pair of posts a rail&nbsp;stretches across the walk, at the height of eight feet above&nbsp;the ground ; and along the under side of the rail, hooks are&nbsp;fixed, on which the yarns are hung as they are spun ; and to&nbsp;one of the upright posts of each pair a large hook is fastened, on which the yarns arc hung when collected together.&nbsp;Fig. 2 shows this arrangement; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aaaa</span><span class="font0"> being the upright posts,,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">fc6 the rails stretching across the spinning walk, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ee</span><span class="font0"> the hocks for the yarns, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cc</span><span class="font0"> the large hooks on which the collected&nbsp;mass of yarns is hung. At the head of the walk a stout&nbsp;post is fixed in the ground, and to it the yarns are fastened&nbsp;as they are finished. At the foot of the walk a similar post&nbsp;is fixed for the same purpose. These posts must be at that&nbsp;side of the walk on which the large hooks are fixed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The walks on which small threads for twines and small cords are spun, have, in place of these rails and hooks, rails&nbsp;about three feet long, let loosely into mortises sunk in the&nbsp;top of upright posts, about three and a half feet above the&nbsp;ground ; and along the top of the rail upright pins are fixed,&nbsp;to keep the threads separate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The spinning machines for rope-yarns consist of two up-</span></p>
