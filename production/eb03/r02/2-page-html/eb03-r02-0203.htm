<p><span class="font0">never after deſiſted from invading it upon every opportunity, till at length they over-ran and deſtroyed it entirely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Veſpaſian continued ſome months at Alexandria in Egypt, where it is ſaid he cured a blind and a lame&nbsp;man by touching them. Before he ſet out for Rome,&nbsp;he gave his ſon Titus the command of the army that&nbsp;was to lay ſiege to Jeruſalem ; while he himſelſ went&nbsp;forward, and was met many miles from Rome by all&nbsp;the ſenate, and near half the inhabitants, who gave the&nbsp;ſincereſt teſtimonies of their joy, in having an emperor&nbsp;of ſuch great and experienced virtues. Nor did he in&nbsp;the leaſt diſappoint their expectations; being equally aſſiduous in rewarding merit, and pardoning his adverſaries ; in reforming the manners of the citizens, and ſetting them the beſt example in his own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the mean time, Titus carried on the war againſt the Jews with vigour, which ended in the terrible deſtruction of the city, mentioned under the article Jews.&nbsp;After which his ſoldiers would have crowned Titus as&nbsp;conqueror ; but he refuſed the honour, alleging that he&nbsp;was only an inſtrument in the hand of Heaven, that&nbsp;manifeſtly declared its wrath againſt the Jews. At&nbsp;Rome, however, all mouths were filled with the praiſes&nbsp;of the conqueror, who had not only ſhowed himſelf an&nbsp;excellent general, but a courageous combatant : his return, therefore,, in triumph, which he did with his father, was marked with all the magnificence and joy that&nbsp;was in the power of men to expreſs. All things that&nbsp;were eſteemed valuable or beautiful among men were&nbsp;brought to adorn this great occaſion. Among the rich&nbsp;ſpoils were expoſed vaſt quantities of gold taken out of&nbsp;the temple ; but the book of their law was not the&nbsp;feaſt remarkable amongſt the magnificent profuſion. A&nbsp;triumphal arch was erected upon this occaſion, on which&nbsp;were deſcribed all the victories of Titus over the Jews,&nbsp;which remains almoſt entire to this very day. Veſpaſian likewiſe built a temple to Peace, wherein were depoſited moſt of the Jewiſh ſpoils ; and having now calmed all the commotions in every part of the empire, he&nbsp;ſhut up the temple of Janus, which had been open about&nbsp;five or ſix years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Veſpaſian having thus given ſecurity and peace to the empire, reſolved to correct numberleſs abuſes which&nbsp;had grown up under the tyranny of his predeceſtbrs.&nbsp;To effect this with greater eaſe, he joined Titus with&nbsp;him in the conſulſhip and tribunitial power, and in ſome&nbsp;meaſure admitted him a partner in all the higheſt offices&nbsp;of the ſtate. He began with reſtraining the licentiouſneſs of the army, and forcing them back to their priſtine diſcipline. He abridged the proceſſes that had&nbsp;been carried to an unreaſonable length in the courts of&nbsp;juſtice. He took care to rebuild ſuch parts of the city&nbsp;as had ſuffered in the late commotions ; particularly the&nbsp;Capitol, which had been lately burnt ; and which he&nbsp;now reſtored to more than former magnificence. He&nbsp;likewiſe built a famous amphitheatre, the ruins of which&nbsp;are to this day an evidence of its ancient grandeur.&nbsp;The other ruinous cities of the empire alſo ſhared his&nbsp;paternal care ; he improved ſuch as were declining,&nbsp;adorned others, and built many anew. In ſuch acts as&nbsp;theſe he paſſed a long reign of clemency and moderation ; ſo that it is ſaid, no man ſuffered by an unjuſt or&nbsp;a ſevere decree during his adminiſtration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Julius Sabinus ſeem§ to be the only perſon who was treated with greater rigour than was uſual with this&nbsp;emperor, &gt;Sabinus was commander of a ſmall army in&nbsp;Gaul, and had declared himſelf emperor upon the death&nbsp;of Vitellius. However, his army was ſhortly after overcome by Veſpaſian’s general, and he himſelf compelled&nbsp;to ſeek ſafety by flight. He for ſome time wandered&nbsp;through the Roman provinces, without being diſcovered: but finding the purſuit every day become cloſer, he&nbsp;was obliged to hide himſelf in a cave ; in which hs remained concealed for no leſs than nine years, attended&nbsp;all the time by his ſaithful wife Empona, who provided&nbsp;proviſions for hi.a by day, and repaired to him by&nbsp;night. However, ſhe was at laſt diſcovered in the&nbsp;performance of this pious.office, and Sabinus was taken&nbsp;priſoner and carried to Rome. Great interceſſion was&nbsp;made to the emperor in his behalf : Empona herſelf appearing with her two children, and imploring her huſ-band’s pardon. However, neither her tears nor intrea-ties could prevail ; Sabinus had been too dangerous a&nbsp;rival for mercy ſo that, though ſhe and her children&nbsp;were ſpared, her huſhand ſuffered by the executioner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But this ſeems to be the only inſtance in which he reſented paſt offences. He cauſed the daughter of Vitellius, his avowed enemy, to be married into a noble&nbsp;family, and he himſelf provided her a ſuitable fortune.&nbsp;One of Nero’s ſervants coming to beg ſor pardon for&nbsp;having once rudely thruſt him out of the palace, and&nbsp;inſulted him when in office, Veſpaſian only took his&nbsp;revenge by ſerving him juſt in the ſame manner. When&nbsp;any plots or conſpiracies were formed againſt him, he&nbsp;diſdained to puniſh the guilty, ſaying, That they de-ferved rather his contempt for their ignorance, than his&nbsp;reſentment ; as they ſeemed to envy him a dignity of&nbsp;which he daily experienced the uneaſineſs. His liberality towards the encouragement of arts and learning,&nbsp;was not leſs than his clemency. He ſettled a conſtant&nbsp;ſalary of 100,000 ſeſterces upon the teachers of rhetoric. He was particularly favourable to Joſephus, the&nbsp;Jewiſh hiſtorian. Quintilian the orator, and Pliny the&nbsp;naturaliſt, flouriſhed in his reign, and were highly eſteemed by him. He was no leſs an encourager of all other&nbsp;excellencies in art ; and invited the greateſt maſters and&nbsp;artificers from all parts of the world, making them conſiderable preſents, as he found occaſion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Yet all his numerous acts of generoſity and magnificence could not preſerve his character from the imputation of rapacity and avarice. He revived many obſo-lete methods of taxation ; and even bought and ſold commodities himſelf, in order to increaſe his fortune»&nbsp;He is charged with advancing the moſt avaricious governors to the provinces, in order to ſhare their plunder&nbsp;on their return to Rome. He deſeended to ſome very&nbsp;unuſual and diſhonourable impoſts, even to the laying&nbsp;a tax upon urine. When his ſon Titus remonſtrated&nbsp;againſt the meanneſs of ſuch a tax, Veſpaſian taking a&nbsp;piece of money, demanded if the ſmell offended him ;&nbsp;and then added, that this very money was produced by&nbsp;urine. Butin excuſe for. this, we muſt obſerve, that&nbsp;the exchequer, when Veſpaſian came to the throne,,&nbsp;was ſo much exhauſted, that he informed the ſenate&nbsp;that it would require a ſupply of three hundred millions (of our money) to re-eſtabliſh the commonwealth»&nbsp;This neceſſity muſt naturally produce more numerous&nbsp;and heavy taxations than the empire had hitherto expe*&nbsp;rienced ; but while the provinces were thus obliged to</span></p>
