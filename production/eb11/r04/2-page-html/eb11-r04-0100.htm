<p><span class="font1">This was long ago recognized by Schweglcr (see his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Romische Geschichte,</span><span class="font1"> passim) on the sufficient ground of the great religious&nbsp;cleavage between the two orders. Such jealousy of mutual&nbsp;contact in religious matters as is apparent all through the&nbsp;history of the city very rarely, if ever, springs from any other&nbsp;source than a real difference of race. This point was developed&nbsp;by Professor W. Ridgeway in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Who were the Romans?</span><span class="font1"> (London,&nbsp;1908), where he points out (a) that the deities tended by the&nbsp;three greater or patrician flamens, namely, Dialis, Martialis,&nbsp;Quirinalis, were all closely connected with the Sabines; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(b)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">further, that the patrician form of marriage, the highly religious&nbsp;ceremony called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Conjarreatio,</span><span class="font1"> differed entirely from the other&nbsp;forms, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Usus</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Coemptio,</span><span class="font1"> which there is reason to attribute to&nbsp;a plebeian origin; (c) that the arms, especially the round&nbsp;shield, carried by the first class in the originally military constitution of Servius Tullius (sec below), arc characteristic of the&nbsp;warriors of Central Europe in the Early Iron and Bronze Age,&nbsp;whereas those of the remaining classes can be shown to have&nbsp;been in general use during the immediately preceding period in&nbsp;the Mediterranean lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For other archaeological evidence separating the patricians from the plebeians, and connecting the patricians closely with&nbsp;the Sabines the reader must be referred to Ridgeway’s essay.&nbsp;It is, however, well to make special mention here of the tradition,&nbsp;which is given by Livy (ii. 16. 4), and is undated but not the less&nbsp;probable for being a non-annalistic tradition, preserved in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font1"> itself, of the prompt welcome given to the Sabine Appius&nbsp;Claudius, the founder of the haughtiest of all the Roman noble&nbsp;families, by the patricians of Rome and his immediate admission&nbsp;to all their political privileges. Ridgeway points out that this&nbsp;implies, at that early time, a substantial identity of race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the linguistic side of the question it is well to mention for clearness’ sake that this Safine or patrician class marked its&nbsp;ascendancy all over Central and Southern Italy, from the&nbsp;6th century b.c. onwards, by its preference for forming ethnic&nbsp;names with the suffix </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">-no-</span><span class="font1"> which it frequently imposed also&nbsp;upon the communities whom it brought under its influence.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sabini</span><span class="font1"> (earlier </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Safini), Romani, Latini, Sidicini, Aricini,&nbsp;Marrucini,</span><span class="font1"> and the like are all names formed in this way (see&nbsp;further Sabini).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may also now be regarded as certain that what we may&nbsp;call the Lower or Earlier Stratum (or Strata) of population in&nbsp;Rome, themselves spoke a language which was as truly Indo-European as the language of their Safine conquerors. In the&nbsp;article Volsci will be found evidence for the conclusion that&nbsp;the language of what has been there entitled the Co-Folk was&nbsp;not less certainly Indo-European, and in some respects probably&nbsp;a less modified form of Indo-European, than that of the Safincs.&nbsp;A number of the names formed with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">-co-</span><span class="font1"> suffix and with&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">-ati-</span><span class="font1"> suffix (which is frequent in the same districts) contain&nbsp;unmistakably Indo-European words such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Graviscae, Marica,&nbsp;dea Marica, Volsci, Casinates, Soracte, Interamnites, Auxumates.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The fusion of this earlier population with the patricians is far&nbsp;easier to imagine when it is recognized that the two parties&nbsp;spoke kindred though by no means identical languages. It is&nbsp;the essentially Indo-European character of the early inhabitants&nbsp;of the Latin plain which has led many scholars to doubt that&nbsp;there was any racial distinction at all between patricians and&nbsp;plebeians, but the increase of knowledge of the dialects spoken&nbsp;in the different regions of Italy has now enabled us to judge&nbsp;this question with very much fuller evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There arises, however, the important question or questions&nbsp;as to the origin, or at least the ethnic connexions of this earlier&nbsp;stratum. The task of the historic inquirer will not be completely&nbsp;performed until at least some further progress has been made&nbsp;in connecting this earlier population of the western coast of&nbsp;Italy, on the one hand, with one or more of the early races&nbsp;(see Siculi, Veneti, Liguria, Pelasgians) whom tradition&nbsp;declares to have once inhabited the soil of Latium; and on&nbsp;the other, with the people or peoples whom archaeological&nbsp;research reveals to us as having left behind them different strata&nbsp;of remains, all earlier than the Iron or Roman Age, both in</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Latium and in other parts of Italy. Professor Ridgeway has taken a short way with these problems which may prove to be&nbsp;the true one; he classes together as Ligurian all prc-Safine&nbsp;inhabitants of Italy save such elements as, like the Etruscans,&nbsp;can be shown to have invaded it over sea (see Etruria,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">§ Language).</span><span class="font1"> This is one of the most promising fields of investigation now open to scholars, but in view of the confused and&nbsp;mutilated shape in which the traditions current in ancient&nbsp;times have come down to us, it demands an exceedingly careful&nbsp;scrutiny of the archaeological and the linguistic evidence, and&nbsp;exceedingly cautious judgment in combining them. The point&nbsp;of outstanding importance is to determine whether the earb’er&nbsp;Indo-European population is to be regarded as having been&nbsp;in Italy from the beginning of human habitation. Archaeologists generally like W. Helbig </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Die Italiker der Poebene)</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;more recently B. Modestov </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Introduction &amp; I’histoire romaine,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Paris, 1907) have been inclined to regard the Ligurians as the&nbsp;most primitive population of Italy, but to distinguish them&nbsp;sharply from the people who built the Lake Settlement and&nbsp;Pile Dwellings, which appear (with important variations of&nbsp;type):—(1) in the western half of the valley of the Po; (2) in&nbsp;the eastern half of the same; (3) in Picenum; (4) in Latium;&nbsp;and (5) as far south as Tarentum. One of the most important&nbsp;points in the identification is the question of the method&nbsp;of burial employed at different epochs by the different&nbsp;communities. (See the works already cited, with that of&nbsp;O. Montelius, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">La Civilisation primitive en Italie.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">populus Romanns</span><span class="font1"> was, we are told, divided into three tribes, Ramnes, Tities and Luceres,<sup>@@1</sup> and into thirty&nbsp;curiae. The three names, as Schulze has shown&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Lat. Eigennamen,</span><span class="font1"> p. 580), are neither more nor less&nbsp;than the names of three Etruscan </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gentes</span><span class="font1"> (whether&nbsp;or not derived from Safine or Latin originals), and the tradition&nbsp;is a striking result of the Etruscan domination in the 6th century&nbsp;b.c.</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>@@2</sup></span><span class="font1"> which we shall shortly consider.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of far greater importance is the division into </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">curiae.</span><span class="font1"> In Cicero’s time there were still curies, curial festivals and curiate&nbsp;assemblies, and modern authors are unquestionably right in&nbsp;regarding the curia as the keystone of the primitive political&nbsp;system. It was a primitive association held together by participation in common </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sacra,</span><span class="font1"> and possessing common festivals,&nbsp;common priests and a common chapel, hall and hearth. As&nbsp;separate associations the curiae were probably older than the&nbsp;Roman state, but,<sup>@@3 </sup>however this may be, it is certain that of&nbsp;this state when formed they constituted the only effective&nbsp;political subdivisions. The members of the thirty curiae form&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">populus Romanns,</span><span class="font1"> and the earliest known condition of&nbsp;Roman citizenship is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">communio sacrorum,</span><span class="font1"> partnership&nbsp;in the curial </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sacra.</span><span class="font1"> Below the curia there was no further&nbsp;political division, for there is no reason to believe that the curia&nbsp;was ever formally subdivided into a fixed number of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gentes&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and families.<sup>@@4</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At their head was the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rex,</span><span class="font1"> the ruler of the united people. The Roman “ king ” is not simply either the hereditary and&nbsp;patriarchal chief of a clan, the priestly head of a&nbsp;community bound together by common </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sacra,</span><span class="font1"> but the&nbsp;elected magistrate of a state, but a mixture of all three.@@5  In</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1 </sup>The tradition connecting the Ramnes with Romulus and the Tities with Tatius is as old as Ennius (Varro, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">L.L.</span><span class="font1"> v. 55). The best&nbsp;authorities on the question, earlier than Schulze’s epoch-making&nbsp;treatise, are Schwegler i. 505, and Volquardsen, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhein. Mus.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">xxxiii. 538.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@2</sup> They are traditionally connected only with the senate </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">300 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patres,</span><span class="font1"> with the primitive legion of 3000, with the vestal virgins, and&nbsp;with the augurs (Varro, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">L.L.</span><span class="font1"> v. 81, 89, 91; Livy x. 6; Festus&nbsp;344; Mommsen i. 41, 74, 75; Genz, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Patncisch. Rom,</span><span class="font1"> 90).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@3 </sup>It is possible that, the curiae were originally connected with separate localities; cf. such names as Foriensis, Veliensis (Fest.&nbsp;174; Gilbert i. 213).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@4 </sup>Niebuhr’s supposition of ten </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gentes</span><span class="font1"> in each curia has nothing in. its favour but the confused statement of Dionysius as to the purely&nbsp;military. Sbcafcy (Dionys, ii. 7; cf. Müller, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Philologus,</span><span class="font1"> xxxiv. 96).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@5 </sup>Rubino, Genz and Lange insisted on the hereditary patriarchal character of the kingship, Ihne on its priestly side, Schwegler </span><span class="font0">on </span><span class="font1">its&nbsp;elective.
