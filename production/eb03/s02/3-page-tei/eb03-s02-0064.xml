She conjured him to let them know, that ſhe would ſubmit herſelf implicitly to the determination of the parliament. Her intreaties and her ſufferings made no impreſſion upon  the nobles. They continued the ſavage cruelty of their demeanour. She implored, as the laſt requeſt ſhe would prefer to them, that they would lead her to her palace. This conſolation, too, was refuſed to her. They wiſhed to accuſtom her ſubjects, to behold her in diſgrace, and to teach them to triumph over her misfortunes. In the moſt mortifying and afflicting hour ſhe had ever experienced, oppreſſed with fatigue, and disfigured with  duſt and ſorrow, they ſhut her up in the houſe of the  lord provoſt: leaving her to revolve in her anxious and agitated mind the indignities ſhe had already endured, and to ſuffer in anticipation the calamities they might yet inflict upon her.</p><p>The malice of Morton and his adherents was ſtill far from being gratified. In the morning, when the queen looked from the window of the apartment to which ſhe had been confined, ſhe perceived a white banner diſplayed in ſuch a manner as to fix her attention. There was delineated upon it the body of the late king ſtretched at the foot of a tree, and the prince upon his knees before it, with a label from his mouth, containing this prayer, "Judge and revenge my cauſe, O Lord!” This abominable banner revived all the bitterneſs of her afflictions. The curioſity of the people  drew them to a ſcene ſo new and ſo affecting. She exclaimed againſt the treachery of her nobles; and ſhe begged the ſpectators to relieve her from their tyranny. The eventful ſtory of the preceding day had thrown her capital into a ferment. The citizens of a better condition crowded to behold the degraded majeſty of their ſovereign. Her ſtate of humiliation, ſo oppoſite to the grandeur from which ſhe had fallen, moved them with compaſſion and ſympathy. They heard her tale, and were filled with indignation. Her lamentations, her diſorder, her beauty, all ſtimulated their ardour for her deliverance. It was announced to the nobles, that the tide of popular favour had turned towards the queen. They haſtened to appear before her, and to aſſure her, with ſmiles and courteſy, that they were immediately to conduct her to her palace, and to reinſtate her in her royalty. Impoſing upon her credulous na</p><p>ture, and that beautiful humanity which characterised her even in the moſt melancholy ſituations of her life, they prevailed with her to inform the people, that ſhe was pacified, and that ſhe wiſhed them to diſperſe themſelves. They ſeparated in obedience to her deſire. The nobles now conveyed her to Holyroodhouſe. But nothing could be farther from their intentions than her re-eſtabliſhment in liberty and grandeur. They held a council, in which they deliberated concerning the manner in which they ought to diſpoſe of her. It was reſolved, that ſhe ſhould be confined during her life in the fortreſs of Lochleven; and they ſubſcribed an order for her commitment.</p><p>A reſolution ſo ſudden, ſo perfidious, and ſo tyrannical, filled Mary with the ιιtmoft aſtoniſhment, and drew from her the moſt bitter complaints and exclamations. Kiiſkaldy of Grange, perceiving with ſurpriſe the lengths to which the nobles had proceeded, felt his honour take the alarm for the part he had acted at their deſire. He expoſtulated with them upon their breach of truſt, and cenſured the extreme rigour of the queen’s treatment. They counſelled him to rely upon the integrity of their motives; ſpoke of her paſſion for Bothwel as moſt vehement, and infilled on the danger of intruding her with power. He was not convinced by their ſpeeches; and earneſtly recommended lenient and moderate meaſures. Diſcreet admonitions, he ſaid, could not fail of impreſſing her with a full ſenſe of the hazards and inconveniences of an improper paſſion, and a little time would cure her of it. They affured him, that when it appeared that ſhe deteſted Bothwel, and had utterly abandoned his intereſts, they would think of kindneſs and moderation. But this, they urged, could hardly be expected; for they had recently intercepted a letter from her to this nobleman, in which ſhe expreſſed, in the ſtrongeſt terms, the warmth of her love, and her fixed purpoſe never to forſake him @@(T). Kirkaldy was deſired to peruſe this letter; and he preſſed them no longer with his remonſtrances. The queen, in the mean time, ſent a meſſage to this generous ſoldier, complaining of the cruelty of her nobles, and reminding him that they had violated their engagements. He inſtantly addreſſed an anſwer to it, recounting the reproaches he had made to them; ſtating his advice; deſcribing the ſurpriſe with which he had read her intercepted letter; and conjuring her to renounce and forget a moſt wicked and flagitious man, and, by this victory over herſelf, to regain the love and reſpect of</p><p>@@@(T) Mr Hume is candid enough to give up the authenticity of this letter; and indeed, ſo far as I have obſerved, there is not the ſlighteſt pretence of a reaſon for conceiving it to be genuine; <hi rend="italic">(Hist. oſ England,</hi> Vol. V. p. 120.) It was not mentioned by the earl of Morton and his adherents to Throgmorton, when Elizabeth interfered in the affairs of Scotland upon the impriſonment of the queen in the caſtle of Lochleven; a period of time when theſe ſtateſmen were deſirous to throw out every imputation to her prejudice, and when in particular they were abuſing her with vehemence for her attachment to Bothwel; <hi rend="italic">(Keith,</hi> p. 419.) Nor was it made uſe of by Murray before the Engliſh commiſſioners. Mary, <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the condition to which the nobles had reduced her, could not well think of a ſtop of this fort, although her attachment to Bothwel had been as ſtrong as they were pleaſed to pronounce it. For, not to ſpeak of the greatneſs of her diſtreſs, ſhe was guarded by them ſo ſtrictly, as to make it vain for her to pretend to elude their vigilance. In regard, too, to her love of Bothwel, it is not clear that it was ever real. While the king was alive, there are no traces of their improper intercourſe. The affair of Dunbar was a criminal ſeduction. The arts of a profligate man overcame her. There was no  ſentiment of love upon either ſide. After her marriage, his rudeneſs extinguiſhed in her altogether any remain  of kindneſs and reſpect; and hence the coldneſs with which ſhe parted with him.” <hi rend="italic">Stuart’s History of Scotland, Vol.</hi> 1. p 253. note.</p></body></text></TEI>
