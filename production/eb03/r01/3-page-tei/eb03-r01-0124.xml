The force, therefore, which is neceffary for keeping a body immoveable in a ſtream of water, flowing with a certain velocity, is the ſame with what is required for moving this body with this velocity through ſtagnant water. To auy one who admits the motion of the earth round the fun, it is evident that we can neither obſerve nor reaſon from a caſe of a body moving through ſtill water, nor of a ſtream of water preſſing upon or impelling a quieſcent body.</p><p>A body in motion appears to be reſiſted by a ſtagnant fluid, becauſe it is a law of mechanical nature that force muſt be employed in order to put any body in motion. Now the body cannot move forward without putting the contiguous fluid in motion, and force muſt be employed for producing this motion. In like manner, a quieſcent body is impelled by a ſtream of fluid, becauſe the motion oſ the contiguous fluid is diminiſhed by this ſolid obſtacle ; the reſiſtance, therefore, or impnlſe, no way differs from the ordinary communica-tions of motion among ſolid bodies.</p><p>Sir Iſaac Newton, therefore, begins his theory of the reſiſtance and impulſe of fluids, by ſelecting a cale where, although he cannot pretend to aſcertain the motions themſelves which are produced iu the particles of a contiguous ſtuid, he can tell preciſely their mutual ra-tios.</p><p>He ſuppoſes two ſyſtems oſ bodies ſuch, that each body oſ the firſt is fimilar to a correſponding body of the ſecond, and that each is to each in a conſtant ratio. He alſo ſuppoſes them to be limilarly iituated, that is, at the angles oſ fimilar figures, and that the homologous lines of theſe figures are in the ſame ratio with the dia-meters of the bodies. He farther ſuppoſes, that they attract or repel each other in fimilar directions, and that the accelerating connecting forces are aſſo propor-tional ; that is, the forces in the one ſyſtem are to the correſponding forces in tne other ſyſtem in a eonſtant ra^ tio, and that, in each ſyſtem taken apart, the forces are as the ſquares of the velocities directly, and as the dia-meters of the correfponding bodies, or their diſtances, inverſely.</p><p>This being the, caſe, it legitimately follows, that if fimilar parts-of the two ſyſtems are put into fimilar mo-tions, in any given inſtant, they will <hi rend="italic">continue</hi>  to move fimilarly, each correſpondent body deſcribing fimilar curves, with proportional velocities : For the bodies be-ing fimilarly fituated,the forces which act on a body in one fyſtem, arifing from the combination of any number of adjoining particles, will have the ſame direction with the force acting on the coι reſponding body in the other ſyſtem, arifing from the combined action of the ſimilar and fimilarly directed forces of the adjoining correſpon-. dent bodies of the other ſyſtem ; and theſe compound forces will have the ſame ratio with the ſimple forces which conſtitute them, and will be as the fquares of the velocities directly, and as the diſtances, or any homologous lines inverſely ; and therefore the chords of curvature, having the direction of the centripetal or centrifugal forces, and fimilarly inclined to the tangents</p><p>of the curves defcribed by the correfponding bodies, will have the ſame ratio with the diſtances of the pan tides. The curves deſcribed by the correſponding bodies will therefore be ſimilar, the velocities will be propor-tional, and the bodies will be ſimilarly ſttuated at the end of the firſt moment, and expofed to the action of ſimilar and fimilarly fituated centripetal or centrifugal forces; and this will again produce fimilar motions during the next moment, and fo on for ever. All this is evident to any perſon acquainted with the elementary doctrines of curvilineal motions, as delivered in the theory of phyfical aſtronomy.</p><p>From this fundamental propofition, it clearly follows, that if two ſimilar bodies, having their homologous lines proportional to thoſe of the two ſyſtems, be fimi-larly projected among the bodies of thoſe two ſyſterirs with any velocities, they will produce fimilar.motions in the two ſyſtems, and will themſelves continue to move fimilarly ; and therefore will, in every ſubſequent moment, ſuffer fimilar diminutions or retardations. If the initial velocities of projection be the ſame, but the denfities of the two ſyſtems, that is, the quantities of matter con-tained in an equal bulk or extent, be different, it is evi-dent that the quantities of motion produced in the two ſyſtems in the ſame time will be proportional to the denſities ; and if the denſities are the ſame, and uniform in each ſyſtem, the quantities of motion produced will be as the ſquares of the velocities, becaufe the motion communicated to each correfponding body will be pro-portional to the velocity communicated, that is, to the velocity of the impelling body ; and the number of ſimilarly fituated particles which will be agitated will aſſo be proportional to. this velocity. Therefore, the whole quantities of motion produced in the fame moment of time will be proportional to the ſquares of the velocities. And laſtly, if the denſtties of the two ſyſtems are uniform, or the ſame through the whole extent of the ſyſtems, the number of particles impelled by fimilar bodies will be as the ſurfaces of theſe bodies.</p><p>Now the diminutions of the motions of the projected bodies are (by Newton’s third law of motion) equal to the motions produced in the ſyſtems; and theſe diminu-tions are the meaſures of what are called the reſtſtances oppofed to the motions of the projected bodies. Therefore, combining all theſe circumſtances, the refiſtances are proportional to the fimilar ſurfaces of the moving bodies, to the denſities of the ſyſtems through which the motions are performed, and to the fquares of the velocities, jointly.</p><p>we cannot form to ourſelves auy diſtinct notion of a fluid, otherwiſe than as a ſyſtem of ſmall bodies, or a collection of particles, ſimilarly or ſymmetrically arranged, the centres of each being fituated in the angles of regular folids. We muſt form this notion of it, whether we ſuppoſc, with the vulgar, that the particles are little globules in mutual contact, or, with the partiſans of corpufcular attractions and repulfιons, we ſuppoſe the particles kept at a diſtance from each other by means of theſe attractions and repιdfions mutually balancing each other. In this laſt caſe, no other arrangement is confiſtent with a quielcent equilibrium : and in this caſe, it is evident, from the theory of curvilineal motions, that the agitations of the particles will always be ſuch, that the connecting forces, in actual exertion,</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
