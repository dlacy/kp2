<p><span class="font0">modern Church historians; Spain produced Suarez, most philosophical of divines. A generation later the French Oratory&nbsp;became the home of Malebranche and of. Richard Simon, father&nbsp;of Biblical criticism. Mabillon and his Benedictines of Saint-Maur paved the way for the systematic investigation of historical records. The Flemish Jesuit Bolland brought the&nbsp;light of criticism to bear on the legends of the saints (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bol-landists).</span><span class="font0"> His French colleague, Petau, better known under&nbsp;his latinized surname of Petavius, opened still wider floodgates&nbsp;when he taught that theological dogmas, like everything else,&nbsp;have a history. Lastly, the Jansenist “ hermitage ” at Port&nbsp;Royal contributed the historian Tillemont, whose bigotry&nbsp;Edward Gibbon declares to be overbalanced by* his erudition,&nbsp;veracity and scrupulous minuteness. Other such communities and “ congregations ”—semi-monastic bodies standing in&nbsp;closer touch with the world than did the medieval orders—&nbsp;undertook the diffusion of knowledge. Wherever they went&nbsp;the Jesuits opened grammar-schools, which had the double&nbsp;advantage of being excellent and cheap. An Italian sisterhood,&nbsp;the Ursulines, was founded for the higher instruction of girls;&nbsp;late in the 17th century a French priest started the Christian&nbsp;Brothers, pioneers of elementary education. Other communities again devoted themselves to parochial work. Such&nbsp;were the Oratorians of St Philip Neri, founded to evangelize&nbsp;the middle classes of Rome. Such, again, were the Lazarists of&nbsp;St Vincent de Paul, whose duty was to preach in neglected&nbsp;country districts. But the most interesting of all these new&nbsp;foundations was the Sisters of Charity, also founded by St&nbsp;Vincent de Paul. This admirable body represents a significant departure from medieval ideals. The old-fashioned nun&nbsp;had spent her'time behind high walls in prayerful contemplation; the one object of the Sister of Charity was the service of&nbsp;her neighbour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Not that medieval ideals were by any means dead; they never burned more brightly than in the Spain of St Teresa&nbsp;(1515-82). Her first idea had been to combat alike the heresies&nbsp;and the worldliness of her time by a return to the austerities&nbsp;of a more heroic age. With this object she founded her order&nbsp;of “ Discalced ” or barefooted Carmelites;- it presently became&nbsp;the refuge of Louise de la Vallière and many another penitent&nbsp;of rank. But mere bodily rigours were not enough for Teresa;&nbsp;she felt the need of rising to a state of complete detachment&nbsp;from all earthly interests and ties. Her whole theology centres&nbsp;in the lines—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ The love of God flows just as much As that of ebbing self subsides;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Our hearts, their scantiness is such,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Bear not the conflict of these rival tides.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">How, then, subdue the rivalry? Teresa turned to the mystical writers, and learnt from them how to root out the last relics&nbsp;of self-love from the mind by a long discipline of mystical&nbsp;trance and “ contemplation.” These ideas, in a very modified&nbsp;form, were introduced into France by the great devotional&nbsp;writer, St Francis of Sales; in the latter half of the 17th century&nbsp;they were pushed to the extravagant length known as Quietism&nbsp;by Fénelon, and especially by -Madame Guyon and Alichel&nbsp;de Molinos. Aleanwhile, the leading conception from which&nbsp;St Teresa started had developed along characteristically&nbsp;different lines in the mind of her compatriot and contemporary,&nbsp;Ignatius Loyola. He quite agreed that self-will was the enemy;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">but was there no quicker way of checkmating it than an interminable course of ecstasies and austerities?&nbsp;The thoughts of the converted. soldier flew back to&nbsp;the military virtue of obedience. In the long-run no self-imposed hardships could prove quite as disagreeable as always&nbsp;being under the orders of some one else. Obedience accordingly&nbsp;became the typical virtue of Ignatius’s society (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jesuits).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The individual Jesuit obeyed his superior, who obeyed the rector, who obeyed the provincial, who obeyed the general, who&nbsp;obeyed the pope, who took his orders straight from God Almighty. Such a theory was of untold practical value to the&nbsp;Church of Rome, more especially during the era of the Reformation. Laynez at the council of Trent has given one signal instance&nbsp;of its working, but its operations were by no means confined to&nbsp;the abstract field of dogma. If men were really to be made&nbsp;obedient, it could only be by stopping them from thinking for&nbsp;themselves about the everyday problems of conduct; and the&nbsp;best way to do this was to furnish them beforehand with a&nbsp;ready-made code of answers to such problems, warranted to&nbsp;meet all needs. Hence casuistry and' the confessional&nbsp;loomed large on the Jesuit horizon. The casuist’s&nbsp;duty was to apply the general precepts of the Church to particular cases. He explained, for instance, when a man was&nbsp;strictly bound to tell the truth; when he might avail himself&nbsp;of the mild licence of an equivocation; and when the Church&nbsp;placed at his service the greater indulgence of a mental reservation. The confessor brought the casuist’s principles to bear&nbsp;on the conscience of his penitents, and thus saved them from&nbsp;the danger of acting on their own responsibility (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Casuistry).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In its origin this system was a perfectly honest attempt to widen the sphere of obedience by making morality wholly&nbsp;objective and independent of the vagaries of the individual&nbsp;conscience. But what was begun in the interest, of obedience&nbsp;was carried on in those of laxity. Experts proverbially differ,&nbsp;and the casuists were no exceptions to the rule. But when&nbsp;great authorities were at variance, it ill became an average&nbsp;priest or penitent to decide. Whatever a grave doctor said&nbsp;must have some solid reasons behind it—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aliqua niti pro-babilitate—</span><span class="font0">and humble lay-folk could act upon it without a&nbsp;twinge of conscience. Thus arose lax casuists of the type of&nbsp;Antonio Escobar (1589-1669), the central figure of Pascal’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Provincial Letters.</span><span class="font0"> Their whole business was to hunt through&nbsp;the older' authorities in search of “ benign ” decisions. Their&nbsp;temptation is easy to understand. Half Europe was full of&nbsp;waverers between Protestantism and Catholicism tolerably&nbsp;certain to decide for the Church that offered them the cheapest&nbsp;terms of salvation; and even in wholly Catholic countries&nbsp;many, especially of the upper class, might easily be scared&nbsp;away from the confessional by severity. Thereby their money&nbsp;and influence would be lost to the Church, and their souls&nbsp;robbed of the priceless benefit of priestly absolution. On the&nbsp;other hand, these “ Escobarine morals ” by no means passed&nbsp;unchallenged; ever since the foundation of the society the&nbsp;aims and methods of the Jesuits had called forth lively opposition in many parts of Catholic Europe, and not least in Loyola’s&nbsp;native land of Spain. But the most effective protest against&nbsp;them was a movement which began when AIichel de Bay, a&nbsp;professor at the Flemish university of Louvain, put forward&nbsp;certain theories on grace and free-will in the latter part of&nbsp;the 16th century. In 1640 a much more elaborate statement&nbsp;of the same ideas appeared in a posthumous treatise&nbsp;on the theology of St Augustine from the pen of Cornelius Jansen, also a Louvain professor (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jansenism).</span><span class="font0"> Into the technical detail of the controversy there is no&nbsp;need to enter. It is enough to say that two rival doctrines of&nbsp;grace and free-will were struggling for mastery in the Roman&nbsp;Church. One theory emphasized the necessity of grace; having&nbsp;been put together by St Thomas Aquinas, it was known as&nbsp;Thomism, and was especially championed by the Dominicans.&nbsp;The other laid the chief stress on free-will; it was known as&nbsp;AIolinism from its inventor, the Jesuit Louis de AIolina, and&nbsp;was in great favour with the society. The two orders came&nbsp;into violent collision at Rome between 1588 and 1606. But&nbsp;the quarrel, known as the controversy </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">de auxiliis gratiae,</span><span class="font0"> was&nbsp;brought to an end by Pope Paul V., who closed the debates&nbsp;and adjourned his decision </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sine die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At first sight this abstract question seemed endlessly remote from the practical policy of Escobar; really there is a close&nbsp;connexion between the two. ’ The whole system of the Jesuits&nbsp;rested on a basis of free-will. Their quarry was the average&nbsp;man; and the best way of impressing the average man is to&nbsp;set before him duties that he feels himself fully capable of&nbsp;performing. Then he will really feel morally responsible if&nbsp;he leaves them undone, hence the necessity of free-will. _0n</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
