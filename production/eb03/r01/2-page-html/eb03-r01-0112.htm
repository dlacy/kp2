<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">If </span><span class="font0">a plaint in replevin bc removed 'into' the court of king’s-bench, &amp;c. and the plaintiff makes default and&nbsp;becomes non-ſuit, or judgment is given againſt him,&nbsp;the defendant hr replevin ſhall have the writ of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">retorno&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">habendo</span><span class="font0"> of the goods taken in diſtreſs.

<p><span class="font0">REPLEVY, in law, is a tenant’s bringing a writ of replevin, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">replegiar't facias,</span><span class="font0"> where his goods are taken&nbsp;by diſtreſs for rent ; which muſt be done within five&nbsp;days after the diſtreſs, otherwiſe at the five days end&nbsp;they are to be appraiſed and fold.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">REPORT, the relation made upon oath, by officers or perſons appointed to viſit, examine, or eſtimate the&nbsp;ſtatc, expences, &amp;c. of any thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Report, in law, is a public relation of caſes judicially argued, debated, reſolved, or adjudged in any of the king’s courts of juſtice, with the cauſes and reafons&nbsp;of the fame, as delivered by the judges. Alſo when&nbsp;the court of chancery, or any other court, refers the&nbsp;ſtating of a caſe, or tire comparing oſ an account, to a&nbsp;mailer of chancery, or other referee, his certificate&nbsp;thereon is called a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">report.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Repose, in painting, certain maffes or large a(Γem-blages of light and ſhade, which being well conducted, prevent the confuſion of objects and figures, by enga&lt;^&nbsp;ging and fixing the eye ſo as it cannot attend to the&nbsp;other parts of the painting for ſome time ; and thus&nbsp;leading it to conſider the ſeveral groups gradually, proceeding as it were from ſtage to ſtage.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">REPRESENTATIVE, one who perforates or ſup-plies the place of another, and is inveſted with his right and authority. Thus the houſe of commons are the&nbsp;reprefentatives of the people in parliament. See Commons and Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REPRIEVE, in criminal law (from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">reprendre,</span><span class="font0"> &quot;to take back”), is the withdrawing of a ſentence for an&nbsp;interval of time ; whereby the execution is ſuſpended.&nbsp;See Judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This may be, firſt, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ex </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ar bitrio judicis,-either</span><span class="font0"> before or after judgment : as, where the judge is not ſatisfied with&nbsp;the verdict, or the evidence is fuſpicious, or the indictment is inſuſſicient, or he is doubtful whether the offence be within clergy ; or ſometimes if it be a ſmall&nbsp;felony, or any favourable circumſtances appear in the&nbsp;criminal’s character, in order to give room to apply to&nbsp;the crown for either an abſolute or conditional pardon.&nbsp;Theſe arbitrary reprieves may be granted or taken off&nbsp;by tlie juſtices of gaol-delivery, although their ſeſſion&nbsp;be finiſhed, and their commiſſion expired : but this ra-ther by common uſage than of ſtrict right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Reprieves may alſo be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ex neceffitate legis :</span><span class="font0"> as wherc a woman is capitally convicted, and pleads her pregnancy. Though this is no cauſe to ſtay judgment, yet&nbsp;it is to reſpite the execution till ſhe be delivered. This&nbsp;is a mercy dictated by the law of nature, w</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">favorem pro-</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lis ;</span><span class="font0"> and therefore no paît of the bloody proceedings in&nbsp;the reign of Queen Mary hath been more juſtly deteſt</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ed, than the cruelty that was exerciſed in </span><span class="font0">the</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">--iſland of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Guernſey, of burning a woman big with child j ' and,' when through the violence of the flames the infant&nbsp;ſprang forth at the ſtake, and was preſerved by the by-ſtanders, after ſome deliberations of the prieſts who aſſiſted at the facrifice, they caſt it into the fire as a young&nbsp;heretic. A barbarity which they newer learned from&nbsp;the laws of ancient Rome; which direct, with the ſame&nbsp;humanity as our own, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">quod prœgnantis maliens damnatœ&nbsp;pcena cUJfèratur, quoad pariat :</span><span class="font0"> which doctrine, has alſo&nbsp;prevailed in England, as early as the firſt memorials of&nbsp;our law will reach. In caſe this plea be made in ſtay&nbsp;of execution, the judge muſt direct a jury of twelve matrons or dſſcreet women to inquire into the fact : and&nbsp;if they bring in their verdict </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">quick with child</span><span class="font0"> (ſor barely </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">with child,</span><span class="font0"> unleſs it bc alive in the womb, is not ſufficient), execution ſhall be ſtaid generally till the next&nbsp;ſeſſion ; and fo from ſeſſion to ſeſſion, till either ſhe is&nbsp;delivered, or proves by the courſe of nature not to have&nbsp;been with child at all. But if ſhe once hath had the&nbsp;benefit of this reprieve, and been delivered, and afterwards becomes pregnant again, ſhe ſhall not be intitled&nbsp;to the benefit of a farther refpite for that cauſe. For;&nbsp;ſhe may now be executed; before the child is quick in&nbsp;the womb ; and ſhall not, by her own incontinence,&nbsp;evade the ſentence of juſtice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another cauſe.of regular reprieve is, if the offender become </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">non compos</span><span class="font0"> between the judgment and the award&nbsp;of execution : for regularly, though a man be </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">compos&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">when he commits a capital crime, yet if he becomes&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">non compos</span><span class="font0"> after, be ſhall not be indicted if after indictment, he ſhall not be convicted; if after conviction,,&nbsp;lie ſhall not receive judgment; if after judgment, he&nbsp;ſhall not be ordered for execution : for </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">furioβιs folo furore punit ur ;</span><span class="font0"> and the law knows not but he might have&nbsp;offered fome reaſon, if in his ſenſes, to have ftayed thefe.&nbsp;reſpectivc proceedings. It is therefore an invariable,&nbsp;rule, when any time intervenes between the attainder&nbsp;and the award of execution, to demand of the priſoner&nbsp;what he hath to allege why execution flιould not be&nbsp;awarded againſt him ; and, if he appears to be infane,,&nbsp;the judge in his diſcretion may and ought to reprieve,&nbsp;him. Ογ, the party may plead in bar of execution ;&nbsp;which plea may be either pregnancy, the king’s pardon, an act of grace, or diverfity of perfou, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">viz.</span><span class="font0"> that&nbsp;he is not the ſame that was attainted, and the like. In&nbsp;this laſt caſe a jury ſhall be impanelled to try this collateral iſſue, namely, the identity of his perſon ; and nob&nbsp;whether guilty or innocent, ſor that has been decided&nbsp;before. And in theſe collateral iſſues the trial ſliall be&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">inftanter ;</span><span class="font0"> and no time allowed the priſoner to make his.&nbsp;defence or produce his witneffes, unleſs he will make&nbsp;oath that he is not the perfon attainted : neither ſhall-any peremptory challenges of the jury be allowed the&nbsp;priſoner, though formerly ſuch challenges were held to,&nbsp;be allowable whenever a man’s life was in queſtion. If&nbsp;neither pregnancy, inſanity, non-identity, nor other plea,,&nbsp;will avail to avoid the judgment, and ſtay the execution,&nbsp;conſequent thereupon, the laſt and ſureſt reſort. is in the&nbsp;king’s moſt gracious pardon ; the granting of which is-the moſt amiable prerogative of the crown.
