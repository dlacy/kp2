<p><span class="font1">him at least that.the first extant definition is due. He defines the enthymeme as a species of syllogism, namely, as “a syllogism&nbsp;from probabilities and signs” (eξ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">εϊκότων καί σημείων).</span><span class="font1"> The&nbsp;“probability” (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">εiκ0ς)</span><span class="font1"> is a general proposition, expressing that&nbsp;which usually happens, as, “wise men are usually just.” The&nbsp;“sign ” (ση<sub>y</sub>uefor) is a particular proposition, as, “ Socrates is just.”&nbsp;The “sign” may be fallible or infallible. If we say, “wise men&nbsp;are just; for Socrates was Avise and just,” this is an enthymeme&nbsp;from a fallible “sign,” the implied syllogism being “Socrates was&nbsp;wise; Socrates was just (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">σημεTov) ; .'.</span><span class="font1"> all wise men are just”;&nbsp;and lιere the “sign” is, in Aristotle’s phrase, “as a particular to&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font1">universal,” because from the one case of Socrates we draw an&nbsp;inference about all men. If, again, we say,—“Here is a sign that&nbsp;he is ill—he is feverish”; our enthymeme is using an infallible&nbsp;sign, the syllogism being, “All who are feverish are ill; he is&nbsp;feverish (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">σημεiov)</span><span class="font1"> ; .<sup>,</sup>. he is ill.” Here, again, the “sign” is “as&nbsp;a particular to a universal.” When the “sign” is thus infallible,&nbsp;it is properly called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tekmerion (τεκμhριοv),</span><span class="font1"> the matter having been&nbsp;demonstrated and concluded (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">πεπεpaσμεvοv)—</span><span class="font1">“for tekmar and&nbsp;peras mean the same thing (‘limit’) in the old language.”&nbsp;Sometimes, again, the fallible sign is “as universal to particular,”&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c.g.,</span><span class="font1"> “ Here is a sign that he has a fever —he breathes quick,” the&nbsp;syllogism being, “Feverish men breathe quick ; he breathes quick&nbsp;(στ7<sub>l</sub>u∈iov) ; . ∙. he has a fever,” where a particular cause is unsoundly&nbsp;inferred from an effect (the “universal”) which might have other&nbsp;causes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When Aristotle thus describes the enthymeme, or rhetorical syllogism, as dealing with “probabilities” aud “signs,” he is&nbsp;describing its ordinary or characteristic materials, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">qua rhetorical&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">syllogism. He does not mean to say that rhetoric cannot use&nbsp;syllogisms formed with other material. It would be hardly needful to point this out, were it not that, in spite of his own clear&nbsp;words, his meaning has sometimes been misunderstood. “The&nbsp;premises of rhetorical syllogisms,” he says, “seldom belong to&nbsp;the class of necessary facts. The subject matter of judgments and&nbsp;deliberations is usually contingent ; for it is about their actions&nbsp;that men debate and take thought ; but actions are all contingent,&nbsp;no one of them, so to say, being necessary. And results which are&nbsp;merely usual and contingent must be deduced from premises of&nbsp;the same kind, as necessary results from necessary premises. It&nbsp;follows that the propositions from which enthymemes are taken&nbsp;will be sometimes necessarily true, but more often only contingently true.” Among the materials of the enthymeme, the “sign ”&nbsp;which is infallible (the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">σημεiοv</span><span class="font1"> which is also a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">τεκμηpιοv)</span><span class="font1"> is so&nbsp;because it is to some necessary truth as part to whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Aristotle did not regard the suppression of one premiss in the statement as essential to the enthymeme. The syllogism, of which&nbsp;the enthymeme is merely a kind, was regarded by him “not in relation to the expression ” ( où </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">προς τbv εζω λόγοι/),</span><span class="font1"> but to the process&nbsp;in the mind (άλλα </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">πρbς τbv iv τη ψυχή λόγοι/, Anal. Rost.,</span><span class="font1"> i. 10).&nbsp;As Sir W. Hamilton has justly said, he could not then have intended&nbsp;to distinguish a class of syllogisms by a verbal accident. The&nbsp;distinction of the rhetorical syllogism, in Aristotle’s view, was in&nbsp;its matter, not in its form. This is, indeed, made sufficiently clear&nbsp;by his own remark that the enthymeme may “often” be more&nbsp;concisely stated than the full, or normal, syllogism </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Rhet.,</span><span class="font1"> i. 2).&nbsp;There is obviously no reason why the rhetorical reasoner should&nbsp;not state both his premisses, if he finds it convenient or effective&nbsp;to do so. Since, however, one of the premisses is often left to be&nbsp;mentally supplied, some of the later writers on rhetoric came to&nbsp;treat this as part of the essence of the enthymeme. It was then&nbsp;that the word ατeλτ)s was interpolated after </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">συλλογισμός</span><span class="font1"> in&nbsp;Aristotle, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Analyt. Prior.,</span><span class="font1"> ii. 27, where the enthymeme is defined&nbsp;as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">συλλογισμός έξ εικότων καί σημείων.</span><span class="font1">@@</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup></span><span class="font1"> Hence Quintilian says&nbsp;of the enthymeme (v. 10), “alii rhetoricum syllogismum, alii&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">imperfectum</span><span class="font1"> syllogismum vocant” ; hence, too, Juvenal’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“curturn&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">enthymema. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The other branch of the ‘ ‘ logical proof ” in rhetoric corresponds to the induction of strict logic, and consists in giving the semblance&nbsp;of inductive reasoning by the use of one or two well-known&nbsp;examples. As Aristotle calls the enthymeme a rhetorical syllogism, so he calls the example </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{παράδειγμα)</span><span class="font1"> “ a rhetorical induction. ”&nbsp;Thus if a man has asked for a body-guard, and the speaker wishes&nbsp;to show that the aim is a tyranny, he may quote the “examples ”&nbsp;of Dionysius and Pisistratus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Aristotle next distinguishes the “universal ” from the ‘ ‘ special ” topics, or commonplaces of rhetoric. The word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">τόπος,</span><span class="font1"> “place,”&nbsp;means in this context “ that place in which a proposition of a given&nbsp;kind is to be sought.” The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">τόποι,</span><span class="font1"> then, are classifications of&nbsp;propositions and arguments which rhetoric makes beforehand,&nbsp;with a view to readiness in debate. Cicero well illustrates the&nbsp;phrase—“As it is easy to find hidden things when the place has&nbsp;Deen pointed out and marked, so, when we want to track out an&nbsp;argument, we ought to know the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">places,</span><span class="font1"> as Aristotle has called&nbsp;these seats, abodes, as it were, from which arguments are drawn.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">@@@</span><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> On this interpolation, see Sir W. Hamilton’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Discussions,</span><span class="font0"> p. 154.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">So a commonplace, or topic, may be defined as the abode of an argument </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{licet definire locum esse argumenti sedem</span><span class="font1"> ; Cic., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Topiea,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">ii. 7). So elsewhere he describes the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">τόποι</span><span class="font1"> of rhetoric as&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“ regiones</span><span class="font1"> intra quas venere et pervestiges quod quæras”—&nbsp;“haunts in which one may hunt and track out the object of&nbsp;quest” (De </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Orat.,</span><span class="font1"> ii. 34). The “universal commonplaces” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{κοινοί&nbsp;τόποι)</span><span class="font1"> are general heads of argument applicable to all subjects&nbsp;whatsoever—as, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font1"> on the “possibility” or “impossibility” of&nbsp;anything. The special commonplaces </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{τόποι των εiδωv, Rhet.,</span><span class="font1"> ii.&nbsp;22, more briefly called efδη) are those which are drawn from&nbsp;special branches of knowledge, as from politics, ethics, &amp;c. Here&nbsp;Aristotle observes that the more a rhetorician enters on the&nbsp;subject-matter of any particular science the more will he tend to&nbsp;pass out of the domain which properly belongs to the art of&nbsp;rhetoric.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In that domain three provinces are distinguished. Deliberative rhetoric </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{συμβουλευτική)</span><span class="font1"> is concerned with exhortation or dissuasion, and with future time; its “end” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{τέλος)—</span><span class="font1">that which&nbsp;it keeps in view, or its standard—is advantage (or detriment) to the&nbsp;persons addressed. Forensic rhetoric </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{δικανική)</span><span class="font1"> is concerned with&nbsp;accusation or defence, and with time past ; its standard is justice&nbsp;or injustice. Epideictic rhetoric—the ornamental rhetoric of&nbsp;“display” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{επιδεικτική)—</span><span class="font1">is concerned with praise or blame, and&nbsp;usually with time present ; its standard is honour or shame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us begin with deliberative rhetoric, says Aristotle, and see&nbsp;what things a deliberative speaker ought to know. The subjects&nbsp;with which, in a public assembly, he will have to deal are mainly&nbsp;these five :—(1) finance, (2) foreign war, (3) home defence, (4)&nbsp;commerce, (5) legislation. Under all these heads, he ought to be&nbsp;provided with some eι'δη, or special commonplaces. Further, all&nbsp;his suasion or dissuasion has reference to the happiness of those&nbsp;whom he addresses. Hence he must be acquainted with the&nbsp;popular notions of happiness which are actually prevalent. Here&nbsp;Aristotle gives a series of popular definitions of happiness, and a&nbsp;list of the elements which are generally regarded as constituting it.&nbsp;A similar analysis of “good” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{αγαθόν)</span><span class="font1"> follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The scientific spirit of the rhetoric is strongly accentuated by the unscientific character of these and subsequent analyses. Aristotle&nbsp;never forgets that his rhetorician wants to know, not what a thing&nbsp;is, but what it is generally thought to be. There is nothing of&nbsp;cynicism or sarcasm in all this. He is simply going through his&nbsp;prescribed task. He is making rhetoric, as such, into a method.&nbsp;But suppose the question arises—“Of two good things which is&nbsp;the better ?” Our deliberative speaker must be able to treat the&nbsp;<sup>,</sup> ‘ universal commonplace ” of degree </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{μάλλον καί ήττον).</span><span class="font1"> Then, he&nbsp;must also know something about the chief forms of government,—&nbsp;democracy, oligarchy, aristocracy, monarchy,—not as they are or&nbsp;should be, but as they are popularly conceived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ornamental rhetoric </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{επιδεικτική),</span><span class="font1"> which is taken next,&nbsp;is somewhat briefly dismissed. It might be conjectured, in explanation of its place in the treatment—we should have expected&nbsp;it to come third—that Aristotle was the first writer who recognized it as an independent kind, and that he viewed it as an offshoot from the deliberative branch. The epideictic speaker must&nbsp;know what most men think “honour” or “shame,” “virtue”&nbsp;or “vice.” At this point a verbal distinction of some interest&nbsp;occurs:—praise </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(έπαινος)</span><span class="font1"> implies moral approbation; but an “encomium” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(έγκώμιον)</span><span class="font1"> is given to “ achievements ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(έργα)</span><span class="font1"> as such.&nbsp;The most generally useful “ topic ” for the ornamental speaker is&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">avξησις</span><span class="font1"> (magnifying),—as the rhetorical induction </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(παράδειγμα)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">most helps the deliberative speaker, and the rhetorical syllogism&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(ενθύμημα)</span><span class="font1"> is most useful to the forensic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In forensic rhetoric, we must begin by analysing injustice.&nbsp;And first, “What are the motives and aims of wrong-doing?”&nbsp;Actions are either voluntary from habit, reason, anger, lust, or involuntary from chance, nature, force. In reference to the voluntary&nbsp;actions, it is needful to know the popular conception of pleasure.&nbsp;Secondly, “What is the character which disposes a man to do wrong,&nbsp;or which exposes him to suffering it ?” These topics must be familiar,&nbsp;in a popular way, to the forensic speaker. He must also know the&nbsp;general grounds on which actions are classed as just or unjust.&nbsp;Actions must be considered, first, in reference to law, which is&nbsp;either special </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(ίδιος),</span><span class="font1"> whether written or unwritten, the law of&nbsp;particular places and communities, or else universal </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{κοινός),</span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;law of nature. The second question about an “unjust” action is&nbsp;whether it hurts an individual or the community. The definition&nbsp;of “being wronged” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(aδικε7σθaι)</span><span class="font1"> is, “to be unjustly treated by a&nbsp;voluntary agent.” Further, the definition of a particular offence&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(επίγραμμα)</span><span class="font1"> sometimes raises a legal issue. A man may admit an&nbsp;act, and deny that it corresponds to the description given of it by&nbsp;the accuser. It is needful, then, to know the definitions of the&nbsp;principal crimes. It may be noticed that Aristotle here&nbsp;anticipates a topic which played a large part in the later&nbsp;rhetoric. The contested issues which he calls </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">αμφισβητήσεις&nbsp;{Rhet.,</span><span class="font1"> iii. 16) were the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">στάσεις</span><span class="font1"> (constitutiones or status) of later&nbsp;days. Thus the issue as to the proper definition of an offence, to&nbsp;which he refers here </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Rlvet.,</span><span class="font1"> i. 13), coincides with the later</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
