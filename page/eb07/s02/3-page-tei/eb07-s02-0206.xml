These are, first, the bulging shield, distinguished by its swelling or bulging out at the flanks ; and, secondly, the indented shield, or shield chancree, which has a number of notches and indentings all round its sides. The use of the ancient shield of this form was, that the notches served to rest the lance upon, that it might be firm while it gave the thrust ; but this form being less proper for the receiving armorial figures, the two former have been much more used in the heraldry of that nation.</p><p>Besides this different form of the shields in heraldry, we find them also often distinguished by their different positions, some of them standing erect, and others slanting various ways and in different degrees. This the heralds express by the word <hi rend="italic">pendant,</hi> “ hanging,” because they seem to be hung up, not by the centre, but by the right or left corner. The French call these <hi rend="italic">ecu pendant,</hi> and the common antique triangular ones ecu <hi rend="italic">ancien.</hi> The Italians call it <hi rend="italic">scuto pendente ;</hi> and the reason given for exhibiting the shield in these figures in heraldry is, that in the ancient tilts and tournaments, they who were to joust at these military exercises were obliged to hang their shields, with their armories, or coats of arms, on them, out at the windows and balconies of the houses near the place, or upon trees, pavilions, or the barriers of the ground, if the exercise was to be performed in the field.</p><p>Those who were to fight on foot, according to Columbier, had their shields hung up by the right corner, and those who were to fight on horseback had theirs hung up by the left. This position of the shields in heraldry is called <hi rend="italic">couche </hi>by some writers, though by the generality <hi rend="italic">pendant.</hi></p><p>It was very frequent in all parts of Europe, in arms given between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries ; but it is to be observed that the hanging by the left corner, as it was the token of the owner’s being to fight on horseback, so it was esteemed the most honourable and noble situation ; and all the pendant shields of the sons of the royal family of Scotland and England, and of our nobility, at the time, are represented thus hanging from the left corner. The hanging from this corner was a token of the owner’s being of noble birth, and having fought in the tournaments before ; but no sovereign ever had a shield pendant any way, but always erect, as they never formally entered the lists of the tournament.</p><p>The Italians generally have their shields of arms of an oval form. This seems to be done in imitation of those of the popes and other dignified clergy ; but their herald, Petro Sancto, seems to regret the use of this figure of the shield, as an innovation brought in by the painters and engravers, as most convenient for holding the figures, but derogatory to the honour of the possessor, as not representing either antiquity or honours won in war, but rather the honours of some citizen or person of learning. Some have carried it so far as to say, that those who either have no ancient title to nobility, or who have sullied it by any unworthy action, cannot any longer wear their arms in shields properly figured, but are obliged to have them painted in an oval or round shield. In Flanders, where this author lived, the round and oval shields are in the disrepute he speaks of ; but in Italy, besides the popes and dignified prelates, many of the first families of the laity have them.</p><p>The secular princes, in many other countries, also retain this form of the shield, as the most ancient and truly expressive of the Roman clypeus.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Shield</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">Heraldry,</hi> the escutcheon or field on which the bearings of coats of arms are placed.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Shield Cape,</hi> a low point on the coast of New Holland, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, which projects six miles into the sea.

It has gradually grown from a dirty fishing village to a town of great extent and wealth, from the coal trade.

It stands on the river Tyne, opposite to North Shields, and, like it, has risen chiefly from the coal trade, but has, besides, extensive salt-works. There are also large establishments for making glass, and for ship-building. It consists for the most part of one street, extending nearly two miles along the bank of the river. The population amounted in 1821 to 8885, and in 1831 to 9682.</p><p>SHIFFNAL, a town of the hundred of Brimstrey, in the county of Salop, 143 miles from London. It is a small place, of no trade except that arising from its being on the great post-road from London to Holyhead. There is a market on Friday. The population amountcd in 1821 to 4411, and in 1831 to 4779.</p><p>SHIJASHROTAN, one of the Kurile Islands, at the eastern extremity of Asiatic Russia, in the ocean south of Kamtschatka.

In confirmation of this etymology, it is alleged that the shilling kept its original signification, and bore the same proportion to the Saxon pound as sicilicus did to the Roman and the Greck, being exactly the forty- eighth part of the Saxon pound.</p><p>However, the Saxon law reckons the pound in the round number at fifty shillings, but they really coined out of it only forty-eight. The value of the shilling was fivepence, but it was reduced to fourpence above a century before the Conquest; for several of the Saxon laws, made in Athelstan’s reign, oblige us to take this estimate. Thus it continued to the Norman times, as one of the Conqueror's laws sufficiently ascertains ; and it seems to have been the common coin by which the English payments were adjusted. After the Conquest, the French <hi rend="italic">solidus</hi> of twelvepence, which was in use among the Normans, was called by the English name of shilling ; and the Saxon shilling of four- pence took a Norman name, and was called the <hi rend="italic">grout,</hi> or great coin, because it was the largest English coin then known in England.</p><p>It was the opinion of Bishops Fleetwood and Gibson, and of the antiquaries in general, that, though the method of reckoning by pounds, marks, and shillings, as well as by pence and farthings, had been in constant use even from the Saxon times, long before the Norman conquest, there was never such a coin in England as either a pound or a mark, nor any shilling, till the year 1504 or 1505, when a few silver shillings or twelvepences were coined, which have long since been solely confined to the cabinets of collectors.</p><p>Mr Clarke combats this opinion, alleging that some coins mentioned by Mr Folkes, under Edward I. were probably Saxon shillings new minted, and that Archbishop Ælfric expressly says that the Saxons had three names for their money : mancuses, shillings, and pennies. He also urges the different value of the Saxon shilling at different times, and its uniform proportion to the pound, as an argument that their shilling was a coin ; and the testimony of the Saxon gospels, in which the word we have translated <hi rend="italic">pieces of silver</hi> is rendered <hi rend="italic">shillings,</hi> which, he says, they would</p></body></text></TEI>
