<p><span class="font0">ſoon after publicly ; till at laſt, hie paſſion increaſing by indulgence, he vas riot content with being merely a&nbsp;ſpectator, but reſolved to become one of the principal&nbsp;performers. His governors, however, did all in their&nbsp;power to reſtrain this perverted ambition ; but finding&nbsp;him reſolute, they incloſed a ſpace of ground in the&nbsp;valley of the Vatican, where he firſt exhibited only to&nbsp;ſome choſen ſpectators, but ſhortly after invited the&nbsp;whole town. The praiſes of his flattering ſubjects only ſlimulated him ſtill more to theſe unbecoming pur-ſuits ; ſo that he now reſolved to allume a new character, and to appear as a finger upon the ſtage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His paſſion for muſic, as was obſerved, was no leſs natural to him than the former ; but as it was leſs man-lv, ſo he endeavoured to defend it by the example of&nbsp;Tome of the moſt celebrated men, who practiſed it with&nbsp;the ſame fondneſs. He had been inſtructed in the&nbsp;the principles of this art from his childhood ; and upon his advancement to the empire, hc had put himſelf&nbsp;under the moſt celebrated maſters. He patiently ſubmitted to their inſtructions, and uſed ail thoſe methods&nbsp;which fingers practice, either to mend the voice, or&nbsp;improve its volubility. Yet, notwithſtanding all his&nbsp;aſſiduity, his voice was but a wretched one, being both&nbsp;feeble and unpltaſant. However, he was reſolved to&nbsp;produce it to the public, ſuch as it was ; for flattery,&nbsp;he knew, would ſupply every deficiency. His firſt public appearance was at games of his own inſtitution, called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">juveniles</span><span class="font0"> ; where he advanced upon the ſtage, tuning&nbsp;his inſtrument to his voice with great appearance of&nbsp;ſkill. A group of tribunes and centurions attended&nbsp;behind him ; when his old governor Bun hus ſtood by&nbsp;his hopeful pupil, with indignation in his countenance,&nbsp;and praiſes on his lips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He was deſirous alſo of becoming a poet : hut he was unwilling to undergo the pain of ſtudy, which a&nbsp;proficiency in that art requires ; he was délirons of being a poet ready made. For this purpoſe, he got together ſeveral perſons, who were conſidered as great wits&nbsp;at court, though but very little known as ſuch to the&nbsp;public. Theſe attended him with verſes which they&nbsp;had compoſed at home, or which they blabbed out ex-temporaneouſly ; and the whole of their compoſitions&nbsp;being tacked together, by his direction, was called a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">poem.</span><span class="font0"> Nor was he without his philoſophers alſo ; he&nbsp;took a pleaſure in hearing their debates after ſupper,&nbsp;but he heard them merely for his amuſement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Furniſhed with ſuch talents as theſe for giving pleaſure, he was reſolved to make the tour of his empire, and. give the moſt public diſplay of his abilities&nbsp;wherever he came. The place of his firſt exhibition,&nbsp;upon leaving Rome, was Naples. The crowds there&nbsp;were ſo great, and the curioſity of the people ſo earned in hearing him, that they did not perceive an&nbsp;earthquake that happened while he was ſinging. His&nbsp;deſire of gaining the ſuperiority over the other actors&nbsp;was truly ridiculous : he made intereſt with his judges,&nbsp;reviled his competitors, formed private factions to ſupport him, all in imitation of thoſe who got their livelihood upon the ſtage. While he continued to perform,,&nbsp;no man was permitted to depart from the theatre, upon&nbsp;any pretence whatſoever. Some were ſo· fatigued with&nbsp;hearing him, that they leaped privately from the walls,&nbsp;or pretended to fall into fainting fits, in order to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">carried out. Nay, it is ſaid, that ſeveral women were delivered in the theatre. Syldiers were placed in ſeveral&nbsp;parts to obſerve the looks and geſtures of the ſpectators,&nbsp;either to direct them where to point their applauſe, or&nbsp;reſtrain their diſpleaſure. An old ſenator, named </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pef-paſian,</span><span class="font0"> afterwards emperor, happening to-fall aſleep upon one of theſe occaſions, very narrowly eſeaped with&nbsp;his li'ſe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>i</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After bring fatigued with the praiſes of his coun. trymen, Nero reſolved upon going over into Greece,&nbsp;to receive new theatrical honours. The occaſion was&nbsp;this. The cities of Greece had made a law to ſend him&nbsp;the crowns from all the games ; and deputies were accordingly diſpatched with this (to him) important embaſſy. As he one day entertained them at his table in&nbsp;the moſt ſumptuou» manner, and converged with them&nbsp;with the utmoſt familiarity, they intreated to hear him&nbsp;fing. Upon his complying, the artſul Greeks teſtified&nbsp;all the marks of ecſtafy and rapture. Applauſes ſo&nbsp;warm were peculiarly pleaſing to Nero : he could not&nbsp;refrain from crying out, That the Greeks alone were&nbsp;worthy to hear him ; and accordingly prepared without&nbsp;delay to go into Greece, where he ſpent the whole year·&nbsp;enſuing. In this journey, his retinue reſembled an army in number ; but it was only, compoſed of fingers,&nbsp;dancers, taylors, and other attendants upon the theatre,&nbsp;ht paſſed over all Greece, and exhibited at all their&nbsp;games, which he ordered to be celebrated in one year.&nbsp;At the 'Olympic games he reſolved to ſhow the people&nbsp;ſomething extraordinary ; wherefore, he drove a chariot with io horſes ; but being unable to ſuſtain the violence of the motion, he was driven ſrom his ſeat. The&nbsp;ſpectators, however, gave their unanimous applauſe, and,,&nbsp;he was crowned as conqueror. In this manner he obtained the prize at the Ifthmian, Pythian, ana Nemean&nbsp;games. The Greeks were not ſparing of their crowns;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font0">obtained 1800 of them. An unfortunate finger&nbsp;happened to oppoſe him on one of theſe occaſions, and&nbsp;exerted all the powers of his art, which, it appears,,&nbsp;were prodigious. But he ſeems to have been a better&nbsp;finger than a politician ; for Nero ordered him to be&nbsp;killed on the ſpot. Upon his return ſrom Greece, he&nbsp;entered Naples, through a breach in the walla of the&nbsp;city, as was cuſtomary with thoſe who were conquerors&nbsp;in the Olympic games. But all the ſplendor of his return was reſerved for his entry into Rome. There he&nbsp;appeared ſeated in the chariot of Auguſtus, dreſſed in&nbsp;robes of purple, and crowned with wild olive, which&nbsp;was the Olympic garland. He bore in his hand the Pythian crown, and had I </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">loo </span><span class="font0">more carried before him.—&nbsp;Befide him ſat one Diodorus, a muſician; and behind&nbsp;him followed a band of fingers, as numerous as a legion, who ſung in honour of his victories. The ſenate,&nbsp;the knights, and the people, attended this puerile pageant, filling the air with their acclamations. The whole&nbsp;city was illuminated, every ſtreet ſmoked with incenſe;.&nbsp;wherever he paſted, victims were ſiain ; the pavement&nbsp;was ſtrewed with ſaſt’ron, while garlands of flowers,,&nbsp;ribbons, fowls, and paſties, (for ſo we are told), were&nbsp;ſhowered down upon him from the window’s as he pall-ed along. So many honours only inflamed his deſires&nbsp;of acquiring new; he at laſt began to take leſtons in&nbsp;wreſtling; willing to imitate Hercules in ſtrength, as&nbsp;he had rivalled Ag&lt;≈&gt;llo in activity.
