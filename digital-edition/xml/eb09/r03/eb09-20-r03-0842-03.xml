From this word is said to come the French <hi rend="italic">Freux.</hi> There are many local German names of the same origin, such as <hi rend="italic">Rooke, Rοueh, Ruch,</hi> and others, but the bird is generally known in Germany as the <hi rend="italic">Saat-Krahx, i.e.,</hi> Seed- ( = Com-) Crow. </note> <hi rend="italic"/> Swedish <hi rend="italic">Raka,</hi> Dutch <hi rend="italic">Roek,</hi> Gaelic <hi rend="italic">Rocas),</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Corvus Jrugilegus</hi> of ornithology, and throughout a great part of Europe the commonest and best-known of the Crow-tribe. Besides its pre-eminently gregarious habits, which did not escape the notice of Virgil <hi rend="italic">(Georg,</hi> i. 382) <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="2"> This is the more noteworthy as the district in which he was born and educated is almost the only part of Italy in which the Rook breeds. Shelley also very truly speaks of the “ Iegioned Rooks ” to which he stood listening “mid the mountains Euganean.” </note> and are so unlike those of nearly every other member of the <hi rend="italic">Corvidæ,</hi> the Rook is at once distinguishable from the rest by commonly losing at an early age the feathers from its face, leaving a bare, scabrous, and greyish-white skin that is sufficiently visible at some distance.

<p>in which these feathers persist, the Rook may be readily known from the black form of <hi rend="smallcaps">Crow</hi> (vol. vi. p. 618) by the rich purple gloss of its black plumage, especially on the head and neck, the feathers of which are soft and not pointed. In a general way the appearance and manners of the Rook are so well known, to most inhabitants of the British Islands especially, that it is needless here to dwell upon them, and particularly its habit of forming communities in the breeding-season, which it possesses in a measure beyond that of any other land bird of the northern hemisphere. Yet each of these communities, or rookeries, seems to have some custom intrinsically its own, the details of which want of space forbids any attempt to set before the reader. In a general way the least-known part of the Rook’s mode of life are facts relating to its migration and geographical distribution. Though the great majority of Rooks in Britain are sedentary or only change their abode to a very limited extent, it is now certain that a very considerable number visit this country in or towards autumn, not necessarily to abide here, but merely to pass onward, like most other kinds of birds, to winter further southwards ; and, at the same season or even a little earlier, it cannot be doubted that a large proportion of the young of the year emigrate in the same direction. As a species the Rook on the European continent only resides during the whole year throughout the middle tract of its ordinary range. Further to the northward, as in Sweden and northern Russia, it is a regular summer-immigrant, while further to the southward, as in southern France, Spain, and most parts of Italy, it is, on the contrary, a regular winter-immigrant. The same is found to be the case in Asia, where it extends eastward as far as the upper Irtish and the Ob. It breeds throughout Turkestan, in the cold weather visiting Afghanistan, Cashmere, and the Punjab, and Sir Oliver St John found a rookery of considerable size at Casbin in Persia. In Palestine and in Lower Egypt it is only a winter-visitant, and Canon Tristram noticed that it congregates in great numbers about the mosque of Omar in Jerusalem. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="3"> It is right to mention that the Canon considers the Rook of Palestine entitled to specific distinction as <hi rend="italic">Corms ayrieola (,Proe. Zook Society,</hi> 1864, p. 444 ; <hi rend="italic">Ibis,</hi> 1866, pp. 68, 69). Inlikemanner the Rook of China has been described as forming a distinct species, under the name of <hi rend="italic">C. pαstinαtor (F roc. Zοοk Society,</hi> 1845, p. 1), from having the feathers of its face only partially deciduous. </note></p><p>There are several moot points in the natural history of the Rook which it is impossible here to do more than mention. One is the cause of the curious shedding on reaching maturity of the feathers of its face, and another the burning question whether Rooks are on the whole beneficial or detrimental to agriculture. In England the former opinion seems to be generally entertained, but in Scotland the latter has long been popular. Tlie absence of sufficient observations made by persons at once competent and without bias compels the naturalist to withhold his judgment on the matter, but the absence of such observations is eminently discreditable to the numerous Agricultural Societies of the United Kingdom, (a. n.)</p>
