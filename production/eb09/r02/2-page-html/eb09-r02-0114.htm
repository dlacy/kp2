The principal among&nbsp;RietscheΓs religious pieces of sculpture are the well-known Christ-Angel, and a life-sized Pietà, executed for the king of Prussia.&nbsp;He also worked a great deal in rilievo, and produced many graceful pieces, especially a fine series of bas-reliefs representing Night&nbsp;and Morning, Noon aud Twilight, designed with much poetical&nbsp;feeling and imagination.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">the English in Australia to a very beautiful inhabitant of that country,</span><span class="font1">@@</span><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> probably because in coloration it resembled&nbsp;the well-known uniform of the rifle-regiments of the British&nbsp;army, while in its long and projecting hypochondriac&nbsp;plumes and short tail a further likeness might be traced&nbsp;to the hanging pelisse and the jacket formerly worn by&nbsp;the members of those corps. Be that as it may, the cock&nbsp;bird is clothed in velvety-black generally glossed with&nbsp;rich purple, but having each feather of the abdomen&nbsp;broadly tipped with a chevron of green bronze, while the&nbsp;crown of the head is covered with scale-like feathers of&nbsp;glittering green, and on the throat gleams a triangular&nbsp;patch of brilliant bluish emerald, a colour that reappears&nbsp;on the whole upper surface of the middle pair of tail-quills.&nbsp;The hen is greyish-brown above, the crown striated with&nbsp;dull white; the chin, throat, and a streak behind the eye are&nbsp;pale ochreous, and the lower parts deep buff, each feather&nbsp;bearing a black chevron. According to James Wilson </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(III.&nbsp;Zoology,</span><span class="font2"> pl. xi.), specimens of both sexes were obtained&nbsp;by Sir T. Brisbane at Port Macquarie, &quot;whence, in August&nbsp;1823, they were sent to the Edinburgh Museum, where&nbsp;they arrived the following year ; but the species was first&nbsp;described by Swainson in January 1825 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Zook Journal,</span><span class="font2"> i.&nbsp;p. 481) as the type of a new genus </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ptiloms,</span><span class="font2"> more properly written </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ptilorrhis,</span><span class="font1">@@</span><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> and it is generally known in ornithology as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">P. paradisea.</span><span class="font2"> It inhabits the northern part of&nbsp;New South Wales and southern part of Queensland as far as&nbsp;Wide Bay, beyond which its place is taken by a kindred&nbsp;species, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">P. vixtoriæ</span><span class="font2"> of Gould, which was found by John&nbsp;Macgillivray on the shores and islets of Rockingham Bay.&nbsp;Further to the north, in York Peninsula, occurs what is&nbsp;considered a third species, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">P. alberti,</span><span class="font2"> very closely allied to&nbsp;and by some authorities thought to be identical &quot;with the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">P. magnifiai</span><span class="font2"> (Vieillot) of New Guinea—the “ Promerops ”&nbsp;of many writers. From that country a fifth species,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">P. wilsoni,</span><span class="font2"> has also been described by Mr Ogden </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Proc.&nbsp;Acad. Philadelphia,</span><span class="font2"> 1875, p. 451, pl. 25). Little is&nbsp;known of the habits of any of them, but the Rifleman-bird&nbsp;proper is said to get its food by thrusting its somewhat&nbsp;long bill under the loose bark on the boles or boughs of&nbsp;trees, along the latter of which it runs swiftly, or by searching for it on the ground beneath. During the pairing-season the males mount to the higher branches and there&nbsp;display and trim their brilliant plumage in the morning&nbsp;sun, or fly from tree to tree uttering a note which is&nbsp;syllabled “yass” greatly prolonged, but at the same time&nbsp;making, apparently with their wings, an extraordinary&nbsp;noise like that caused by the shaking of a piece of stiff&nbsp;silk stuff. Verreaux informed Mr Elliot that he believed&nbsp;they breed in the holes of trees and lay white eggs; but on&nbsp;that score nothing is really known. The genus </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ptilorrhis,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">thought by Gould to be allied to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Climacteris,</span><span class="font2"> has been&nbsp;generally placed near </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Epimachus,</span><span class="font2"> which is now considered,</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font2">RIGA (Esth. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ria-Lin∖</span><span class="font2"> a seaport of Russia, in 56° 57' N. lat. and 24° 6' E. long., 375 miles south-west of St&nbsp;Petersburg, is in population the fifth city of the empire,&nbsp;while in foreign trade it ranks next to St Petersburg and&nbsp;Odessa. It is the seat of the governor-general of the&nbsp;Russian Baltic provinces, and also the capital of the&nbsp;province of Livonia. The Gulf of Riga, 115 miles long&nbsp;and 100 miles in width, with shallow &quot;waters of inconsiderable salinity (greatest depth 27 fathom»), freezes to some&nbsp;extent every year. The town is situated at the southern&nbsp;extremity of the gulf, 8 miles above the mouth of the Düna&nbsp;(Dwina), w<sup>τ</sup>hich brings Riga into water communication with&nbsp;an extensive region, as also with the basins of the Dnieper&nbsp;and Volga. Below the town the Düna, from 580 to 2300&nbsp;yards in breadth, divides into several branches, among&nbsp;islands and sand banks, receiving before it enters the sea&nbsp;the Bolderaa river, and expanding towards the east into&nbsp;wider lacustrine basins. At its sea entrance the water&nbsp;on the bar has an average depth of only 14 feet, and the&nbsp;entrance of the river is protected by the fortress of Dünamünde, connected by rail with Riga, while another line&nbsp;on the right bank connects the city with the Mühlgraben&nbsp;village opposite. As the Düna freezes at Riga for an&nbsp;average of 127 days annually, the port remains closed for&nbsp;navigation from December to March. The roadstead at&nbsp;the mouth of the river, though now protected by a mole,&nbsp;is still too much exposed, so that only such vessels as&nbsp;cannot pass the bar remain there, the others discharging&nbsp;part of their cargo at Bolderaa or Mühlgraben and then&nbsp;entering the Düna, which also they leave only partially&nbsp;laden. Improvements designed to obviate these inconveniences are now going on both at the outer harbour and&nbsp;at the new one, the “ Zollliafén.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Riga consists of four parts—the old town and the St Petersburg and the Moscow suburbs standing on the right&nbsp;bank of the Düna, and the Mitau suburb on the left bank,&nbsp;connected by a floating bridge which is removed in winter,&nbsp;and by a viaduct, 820 feet long, resting on light piers of&nbsp;solid stone, and leaving a passage for ships. The old town&nbsp;still preserves its Hanseatic features—high storehouses,&nbsp;with spacious granaries and cellars, lining the narrow',&nbsp;winding, and busy streets. The only open spaces are the&nbsp;market-place and two other squares, one of which, facing&nbsp;the citadel, is ornamented by a granite column erected in&nbsp;commemoration of the defeat of Napoleon I.
