                <p><label>RHODIOLA</label>, rose-wort, in botany: A genus of the octandria order,
                    belonging to the diœcia claſs of plants ; and in the natural method ranking
                    under the 13th order, <hi rend="italic">Succulentœ.</hi> The male calyx is
                    quadripartite ; the corolla tetrapetalous. The female calyx is quadripartite,
                    and there is no corolla ; the nectaria are four; the piſtils four ; and there
                    are four polyſpermous capſules. There are two ſpecies, the roſea and the minor :
                    the firſt grows naturally in the clefts of the rocks and rugged mountains of
                    Wales, Yorkſhire, and Weſt-moreland. It has a very thick fleſhy root, which when
                    cut or bruiſed fends out an odour like roſes. It has thick ſucculent ſtalks,
                    like thoſe of orpine, about nine inches long, cloſely garniſhed with thick
                    ſucculent leaves indented at the top. The ſtalk is terminated by a chι-ſter of
                    yellowiſh herbaceous flowers, which have an agreeable ſcent, but are of ſhort
                    continuance. The ſecond ſort is a native of the Alps, and has purpliſh flowers
                    which come out later than the former ; it is alſo of a ſmaller ſize. Both
                    ſpecies are eaſily propagated by parting their roots ; and require a ſhady
                    ſituation, and dry undunged foil. The fragrance of the firſt ſpecies, however,
                    is greatly diminiſhed by cultivation.</p>
