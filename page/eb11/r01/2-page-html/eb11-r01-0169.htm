<p><span class="font2">RAYLEIGH, JOHN WILLIAM STRUTT, 3rd baron (1842-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), English physicist, was born in Essex on the 12th of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">November 1842, being the son of the 2nd baron.@@<sup>1</sup> Going to Trinity College, Cambridge, he graduated as senior wrangler in&nbsp;1865, and obtained the first Smith’s prize of the year, the second&nbsp;being gained by Professor Alfred Marshall. He married in&nbsp;1871 a sister of Mr A. J. Balfour, and succeeded to the title&nbsp;in 1873. From 1879 to 1884 he was Cavendish professor of&nbsp;experimental physics in the university of Cambridge, in&nbsp;succession to Clerk Maxwell; and in 1887 he accepted the post&nbsp;of professor of natural philosophy at the Royal Institution of&nbsp;Great Britain, which he resigned in 1905. His early mathematical and physical papers, written under the name of J. W.&nbsp;Strutt, made him known over Europe; and his powers rapidly&nbsp;matured until, at the death of Clerk Maxwell, he stood at the&nbsp;head of British physicists, Sir George Stokes and Lord Kelvin&nbsp;alone excepted. The special feature of his work is its extreme&nbsp;accuracy and definiteness; he combines the highest mathematical acumen with refinement of experimental skill, so that&nbsp;the idea of ranking him as higher in one department than&nbsp;another does not arise. His experimental investigations are&nbsp;carried out with plain and usually home-made apparatus, the&nbsp;accessories being crude and rough, but the essentials thoughtfully designed so as to compass in the simplest and most perfect&nbsp;manner the special end in view. A great part of his theoretical&nbsp;work consists in resurveying things supposed superficially to be&nbsp;already known, and elaborating their theory into precision and&nbsp;completeness. In this way he has gone over a great portion of&nbsp;the field of physics, and in many cases has either said the last&nbsp;word for the time being, or else started new and fruitful develop*·&nbsp;ments. Possessing an immense range of knowledge, he has&nbsp;filled up lacunae in nearly every part of physics, by experiment,&nbsp;by calculation, and by clear accurate thought. The following&nbsp;branches have especially felt his influence:—chemical physics,&nbsp;capillarity and viscosity, theory of gases, flow of liquids, photo-graphy, optics, colour vision, wave theory, electric and magnetic&nbsp;problems, electrical measurements, elasticity, sound and&nbsp;hydrodynamics. The numerous scientific memoirs in which his&nbsp;original work is set forth were collected under his own editorship&nbsp;in four large volumes, the last of which was published in 1903.&nbsp;His most extensive single work is a book on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sound</span><span class="font2">, which, in&nbsp;the second edition, has become a treatise on vibrations in&nbsp;general. His familiarity with the methods of mathematical&nbsp;analysis and a certain refinement of taste in their application&nbsp;have resulted in great beauty of form. His papers are often&nbsp;difficult to read, but never diffuse or tedious; his mathematical&nbsp;treatment is never needlessly abstruse, for when his analysis is&nbsp;complicated it is only so because the subject-matter is complicated. Of discoveries superficially sensational there are few&nbsp;or none to record, and the weight of his work is for the most&nbsp;part to be appreciated only by professed physicists. One&nbsp;remarkable discovery, however, of general interest, was the&nbsp;outcome of a long series of delicate weighings and minute&nbsp;experimental care in the determination of the relative density&nbsp;of nitrogen gas—undertaken in order to determine the atomic&nbsp;weight of nitrogen—namely, the discovery of argon, the first of a&nbsp;series of new substances, chemically inert, which occur, some&nbsp;only in excessively minute quantities, as constituents of the&nbsp;earth’s atmosphere. Lord Rayleigh had an interest in abnormal&nbsp;psychological investigations, and became a member and vice-president of the Society for Psychical Research. He was one of&nbsp;the original members of the Order of Merit, instituted in connexion with the coronation of King Edward VII. In 1904 he&nbsp;was awarded a Nobel prize, and at the end of 1905 he became&nbsp;president of the Royal Society, of which he had been elected&nbsp;a fellow in 1873, and had acted as secretary from 1885 to 1896.&nbsp;He remained president till 1908, in which year he was chosen to&nbsp;succeed the 8th duke of Devonshire as chancellor of Cambridge&nbsp;University.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> The barony was created at George IV.'s coronation in 1821 for the wife of Joseph Holden Strutt, M.P. for Maldon (1790-1826)&nbsp;and Okehampton (1826-1830), who had done great service during&nbsp;the French War as colonel of the Essex militia. He died in 1845,&nbsp;his wife, the baroness, predeceasing him in 1836. Their son&nbsp;(d. 1873) was the 2nd baron.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>

<p><span class="font2">RAYMOND, HENRY JARVIS (1820-1869), American journalist, was born near the village of Lima, Livingston county, New&nbsp;York, on the 24th of January 1820. He graduated from the&nbsp;university of Vermont in 1840. After assisting Horace Greeley&nbsp;(</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q.υ.</span><span class="font2">) in the conduct of more than one newspaper, Raymond in&nbsp;1851 formed the firm of Raymond, Jones &amp; Co., and the first&nbsp;issue of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span><span class="font2"> appeared on the 18th of September&nbsp;1851; of this journal Raymond was editor and chief proprietor&nbsp;until his death. Raymond was a member of the New York&nbsp;Assembly in 1850 and 1851, and in the latter year was speaker.&nbsp;He supported the views of the radical anti-slavery wing of the&nbsp;Whig party in the North. His nomination over Greeley on the&nbsp;Whig ticket for lieutenant-governor in 1854 led to the dissolution&nbsp;of the famous political “ firm ’’ of Seward, Weed and Greeley.&nbsp;Raymond was elected, and served in 1854-56. He took a&nbsp;prominent part in the formation of the Republican party, and&nbsp;drafted the famous “ Address to the People ” adopted by the&nbsp;Republican convention which met in Pittsburg on the 22nd of&nbsp;February 1856. In 1862 he was again a member, and speaker,&nbsp;of the New York Assembly. During the Civil War he supported&nbsp;Lincoln’s policy in general, though deprecating his delays, and he&nbsp;was among the first to urge the adoption of a broad and liberal&nbsp;attitude ĩn dealing with the people of the South. In 1865 he was&nbsp;a delegate to the National Republican Convention, and was made&nbsp;a member, and chairman, of the Republican National Committee.&nbsp;He was a member of the National House of Representatives in&nbsp;1865-67, and on the 22nd of December 1865 he ably attacked&nbsp;Thaddeus Stevens’s theory of the “ dead ” states, and, agreeing&nbsp;with the President, argued that the states were never out of the&nbsp;Union, inasmuch as the ordinances of secession were null. In&nbsp;consequence of this, of his prominence in the Loyalist (or&nbsp;National Union) Convention at Philadelphia in August 1866,&nbsp;and of his authorship of the * “ Address and Declaration of&nbsp;Principles,” issued by the convention, he lost favour with his&nbsp;party. He was removed from the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee in 1866, and in 1867 his nomination as minister to Austria, which he had already refused, was&nbsp;rejected by the Senate. He retired from public life in 1867 and&nbsp;devoted his time to newspaper work until his death ĩn New York&nbsp;city on the 18th of June 1869. Raymond was an able and&nbsp;polished public speaker; one of his best known speeches was a&nbsp;greeting to Kossuth, whose cause he warmly defended. But his&nbsp;great work was in elevating the style and general tone of&nbsp;American journalism. He published several books, including a&nbsp;biography of President Lincoln—</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Life and Public Servîtes of&nbsp;Abraham Lincoln</span><span class="font2"> (1865), which in substance originally appeared&nbsp;as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A History of the Administration of President Lincoln</span><span class="font2"> (1864).</span></p>
