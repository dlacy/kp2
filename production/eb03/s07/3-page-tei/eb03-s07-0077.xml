In the month of January 1708 he paſſed the Niemen, and entered the ſouth gate of Grodno just as Peter was quitting the place by the north gate. Charles at this time had advanced to ſome diſtance before the army at the head of 600 horſe. The Czar having intelligence of his ſituation, ſent back a detachment of 2000 men to attack him : but they were utterly defeated ; and this disappointment was followed by the total evacuation of Lithuania. The king purſued his flying enemies in the midſt of ſnow and ice, over mountains, rivers, moraſſes, and through almoſt every obſtacle that could be ſurmounted by human power. He had foreſeen all difficulties, and determined to ſurmount them all. As he knew that the country could not furnish proviſions ſufficient for the ſubſiſtence of his army, he had provided a great quantity of biſcuit, on which his men chiefly ſubſiſted till they came to the banks of the Berezine, in view of Boriſlow. Here the Czar was posted, and Charles deſigned to bring him to a battle ; after which he could penetrate with the greater ease into Ruſſia. Peter, however, did not think proper to come to an action ; but retreated towards the Boristhenes, whither he was purſued by Charles as ſoon as he had refreshed his army The Russians had deſtroyed the roads and deſolated the country ; nevertheless the Swediſh army advanced with great celerity, and in their way defeated 20,000 of the enemy, though entrenched to the teeth. This victory, conſidering the circumſtances in which it was gained, was one of the moſt glorious the Swedes ever obtained. The memory of it is preserved by a medal ſtruck in Sweden, with this inſcription, <hi rend="italic">Sylvee, Poludes, Aggeres, Hostes, victi.</hi></p><p>When the Russians had repassed the Boriſthenes, which ſeparates Poland from Muscovy, the Czar, finding himſelf cloſely purſued by an enemy with whom he was not able to cope, determined at laſt to propose peace. Propoſals were accordingly made ; but Charles returned no other answer than that he would treat at Moſcow; which being reported to Peter, he coolly replied, “My brother Charles affects to play Alexander, but he will not find in me a Darius.” However, he did not think proper to venture an engagement, but continued his retreat ; and Charles purſued io cloſe, that he was daily ſkirmiſhing with the rear of the enemy. In theſe actions the Swedes had generally the advantage, though in the main theſe victories proved detrimental, by weakening the army in a country where it was impoſſible to recruit. Near Smolenſko, the king, with only six regiments, defeated a body of 10,000 horſe and 6000 Calmucks. In this engagement he was expoſed to the utmoſt danger, the enemy having ſeparated him from his troops. With one regiment only, he fought with ſuch fury as dispersed the enemy, and drove them before him, at the time they thought themſelves ſure of taking him prisoner. Two aids-de-camp that fought near him were killed ; his horſe was killed, as was alſo an equerry while he preſented another. The enemy had broke through the regiment, and got quite up to the king; who is said to have on this occaſion killed 12 men with his own hand without receiving a wound.</p><p>By the 3d of October 1708 Charles was within 100 leagues of Moſcow ; but the Czar had made the roads impassable, either by laying them under water, digging deep ditches, or covering them with the wood of whole foreſts. He had alſo deſtroyed the villages on every side, and taken away every possibility of ſubſiſting an army The ſeaſon was alſo far advanced ; the intenſe ſevere weather was approaching ; ſo that the Swedes were threatened with all the miſeries of cold and famine, at the same time that they were exposed to the attacks of an enemy greatly ſuperior in number, who, from their knowledge of the country, had almoſt constant opportunities of harassing and attacking them by ſurprise. For theſe reasons the king reſolved to paſs thro’ the Ukrain, where Mazeppa, a Poliſh gentleman, was general and chief of the nation, Mazeppa having been affronted by the Czar, readily entered into a treaty with Charles, whom he promiſed to aſſiſt with 30,000 men, great quantities of proviſions and ammunition, and with all his treaſures, which were immenſe. The Swediſh army advanced towards the river Diſna, where they had to encounter the greatest difficulties; a foreſt above 40 leagues in extent, filled with rocks, mountains, and marſhes. To complete their misfortunes, they were led 30 leagues out of the right way ; all the artillery was sunk in bogs and marſhes ; the proviſion of the ſoldiers, which conſiſted of biſcuit, was exhausted ; and the whole army spent and emaciated when they arrived at the Diſna. Here they expected to have met Mazeppa with his reinforcement ; but inſtead of that, they perceived the oppoſite banks of the river covered with a hoſtile army, and the paſſage itſelf almoſt impracticable. Charles, however, was ſtill undaunted; he let his soldiers by ropes down the ſteep banks ; they crossed the river either by ſwimming or on rafters hastily put together; drove the Russians from their post, and continued their march. Mazeppa soon after appeared, having with him about 6000 broken remains of the army he had promiſed. The Russians had got intelligence of his designs, defeated and diſperſed his adherents, laid his towns in allies, and taken all the proviſions collected for the Swediſh army However, he ſtill hoped to be uſeful by his intelligence in an unknown country ; and the Cossacks, out of revenge, crowded daily to the camp with proviſions.</p><p>Greater misfortunes ſtill awaited the Swedes. When Charles entered the Ukrain, he had ſent orders to general Lewenhaupt to meet him with 15,000 men, 6000 of whom were Swedes, and a large convoy of proviſions. Againſt this detachment Peter now bent his whole force, and marched againſt him with an army of 65,000 men. Lewenhaupt had received intelligence that the Russian army conſiſted only of 24,000; a force to which he thought 6000 Swedes ſuperior, and therefore diſdained to entrench himſelf. A furious conteſt enſued; in which the Russians were defeated with the loss of 15,000 men. The Swedes continued their march ; but, by the treachery of their guide, were led into a marſhy country, where the roads were made impassable by deep ditches and trees laid across. Here he was again attacked by the Czar with his whole army. Lewenhaupt had ſent a detachment of two battalions to diſpute the paſſage of the enemy over a morals ; but finding they were likely to be overpowered, he marched at the head of the whole infantry to their relief. Another deſperate battle ensued ; when at last the Russians were put in diſorder) and on the point of being totally defeated, when the Czar gave orders to the Cossacks and Calmucks to fire upon all the Russians who fled. “ Even kill me (said he) if I ſhould be ſo cowardly as to turn my back.” On this the battle was renewed with great vigour ; but notwithſtanding theſe positive orders, and the example of the Czar himſelf, the Russians were a third time put in diſorder, after loſing 6000 men, when general Baver arrived with a ſtrong reinforcement of freſh Russian troops. The engagement was again renewed, and continued without intermiſſion till night. The Swedes took poſſeſſion of an advantageous poſt ; but were next morning attacked by the Russians. Lewenhaupt had formed a kind of rampart of his waggons, but was obliged to set fire to them, in order to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy, and at the same time to cover his retreat by the ſmoke. The Russians, however, came ſoon</p></body></text></TEI>
