<p><span class="font2">simplest classical music has a rhythm for which no criteria of poetic metre can be made adequate. From the musical point&nbsp;of view, the rhythm of speech, whether in prose or verse, is very&nbsp;subtle and almost uniformly fluent. The metrical feet which&nbsp;constitute the details of poetic rhythm are musically very&nbsp;minute; and the exaggerated forms in which music represents&nbsp;them are many and* varied. On the other hand, the groups of&nbsp;metrical feet which constitute any one kind of verse are of a&nbsp;uniformity which for music on a large scale would be intolerable.&nbsp;Artistic music is soon compelled to draw upon infinite resources&nbsp;of its own, which preserve an appropriate accentuation of the&nbsp;sense and feeling, while obliterating or hugely exaggerating the&nbsp;poet’s rhythmic effects. Musical rhythm cannot be studied&nbsp;on a sound basis unless its radical divergences from speech-rhythm are recognized from the outset.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the earIiest extant musical settings of poetry the treatment of accent and quantity was strictly arithmetical ; and purely&nbsp;aesthetic requirements were satisfied by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ex post facto</span><span class="font2"> inference&nbsp;from the arithmetical laws, rather than treated as the basis of&nbsp;the laws. Accent, when translated into music, is a rhythmic&nbsp;sensation resembling the stress we put on the left foot in marching; while quantity rarely suggests any bodily movement at&nbsp;all, since it can correspond only to variations in the length of&nbsp;steps. Now in modem music a sense akin to that of bodily&nbsp;movement is of overwhelming importance. Changes of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tempo,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and of the grouping of musical beats, are incidents as obvious&nbsp;in their effect as changes in the pace of a running horse. One&nbsp;consequence is that the laws of musical accent are simple and&nbsp;cogent, while the laws of musical quantity, if such exist, are far&nbsp;beyond analysis. Fluent speech and energetic physical exercise&nbsp;cannot be carried on simultaneously by the same person; and&nbsp;hence the laws of quantity belong to speech rather than to dance.&nbsp;Before we could form adequate notions of the musical rhythms&nbsp;of classical Greece, we should need to settle, firstly, how far the&nbsp;dancing in Greek drama included movements other than idealized dramatic gesticulation; secondly, how much bodily energy&nbsp;was involved in all dancing that may have gone beyond this;&nbsp;and lastly, how much dancing of any kind was executed by the&nbsp;singers while singing. What is certain is that ancient Greek&nbsp;musical rhythms were exact translations of verse rhythms,&nbsp;with the quantities interpreted arithmetically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The extant fragments of Greek music are, whether we have read them correctly or not, undoubtedly very different in rhythm&nbsp;from the system of discant on which European music of the&nbsp;12th and 13th centuries first developed; but they resemble&nbsp;discant in so far as the modern sense of rhythm is absent and&nbsp;its place is supplied by a sense of the rhythmic expression of&nbsp;unusually slow and emphatic speech. In ordinary speech there&nbsp;is an important difference between long syllables and short;&nbsp;but it is not naturally regulated by an exact rhythm, and the&nbsp;art by which it is organized in verse admits (or indeed demands)&nbsp;considerable freedom on the part of the reciter in varying his&nbsp;pace within such limits as do not destroy the structure of the&nbsp;lines. But when a chorus is made to sing words, it must, if the&nbsp;words are to reach the hearer, sing them slowly; and moreover,&nbsp;it must sing them exactly together, unless, as in much classical&nbsp;music, it can repeat them until they are either understood or&nbsp;dismissed from the mind as a mere pretext for the employment&nbsp;of voices in a merely musical design. In any case, if a chorus&nbsp;is to sing well together, the contrast between short and long&nbsp;syllables must be placed on an arithmetical basis, the simpler&nbsp;the better. Now the sole function of ancient Greek music was&nbsp;to enhance the emotional effect of poetic words by regulating&nbsp;their rise and fall in a musical ^cale and their length in a metrical&nbsp;scheme; and it was natural and right that its rhythms should,&nbsp;though accurate, have no stronger ictus than those of the words.&nbsp;To make them as rigid and forcible as the rhythms of a non-vocal&nbsp;music would produce an effect as intolerable to a Greek ear as&nbsp;a schoolboy’s worst jog-trotting scansion of poetry. We need&nbsp;not, then, imagine that the human sense of rhythm has suffered&nbsp;any mysterious change, when our best attempts at deciphering&nbsp;the extant fragments of ancient Greek music yield us a rhythm&nbsp;which scholars can explain by the structure of Greek verse, but&nbsp;which gives us no musical sense. Neither here nor in such&nbsp;strange harmonic phenomena as our complete inversion of&nbsp;medieval harmonic ideas as to the treatment of “ perfect concords ” (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Harmony)</span><span class="font2"> do we find any principle involved which&nbsp;is not as true at the present day as it ever was. Ancient musical&nbsp;rhythm shared in the general qualities of that “ Flatland ”&nbsp;which we know ancient music to have been; modem musical&nbsp;rhythm, like harmony, belongs, as it were, to a three-dimensioned&nbsp;musical space with the vast artistic resources of a consistent&nbsp;perspective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Indeed, we need much the same kind of mental gymnastic in studying the origins of musical rhythm as we need for the&nbsp;much more abstruse subject of harmonic origins. The two&nbsp;subjects soon begin to show interaction. During the period of&nbsp;discant we find metrical conceptions already strongly modified&nbsp;by two purely musical factors. Firstly, the attempt to make&nbsp;voices produce a harmony from different simultaneous melodies&nbsp;(instead of from combinations conceived as disguised unison)&nbsp;brought with it the necessity for differences of length enormously&nbsp;larger than any possible metrical differences. The metrical&nbsp;influence, however, still so predominated, even in the 14th&nbsp;century, as to produce a rhythm based almost exclusively on&nbsp;what would now be called triple time. Secondly, that sense of&nbsp;bodily movement, for which the less clumsy term “ dance-rhythm ” is far too narrow, gained ground as the only means&nbsp;powerful enough to hold the various rhythms of the new and&nbsp;growing polyphony together. In the later stages of discant the&nbsp;old metrical conceptions struggled against the grain of the&nbsp;polyphony for awhile, only to succumb in a tangle of inextricable&nbsp;technicality: and the new art, which became coherent in the&nbsp;15th century, disregarded poetic metre, with little or no loss in&nbsp;capacity to interpret words if the composer had leisure or desire&nbsp;to do so; since, after all, poetic rhythm in its highest forms has a&nbsp;subtle freedom which renders mechanical musical translation&nbsp;worse than useless, while the rhythmic swing of the lighter forms&nbsp;of poetry was soon discovered by the composers of the “ Golden&nbsp;Age ” to be practically identical with the refined dance-rhythm&nbsp;which they in their lighter moments idealized from folk-music.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By the middle of the 15th century polyphony attained such independence that the only rhythms which would hold&nbsp;the flow of independent melodious voices together were those&nbsp;in which a steadily duple or steadily triple rhythm (either of&nbsp;which might be subdivided by the other or by itself) could be&nbsp;felt as an absolutely regular musical tread. Such a rhythm&nbsp;is capable of expressing every poetic foot, either by the difference of stress between notes or by a difference in their length.&nbsp;Moreover, emphasis may be obtained by the pitch of the note,&nbsp;or, again, by its harmonic significance. All these forms of&nbsp;emphasis combine and counteract each other in an infinite&nbsp;variety, till the sense of musical movement becomes as remote&nbsp;from crude dance-rhythm as it is from poetic metre. But&nbsp;though the part thus played by accent was already of paramount importance in the “ Golden Age ” of music, it was not&nbsp;allowed to become evident to the ear except in the lighter&nbsp;and more coarse-grained art-forms. Its highest purpose was&nbsp;served as soon as the listener was able to lose all crude rhythmic&nbsp;impulses in a secure feeling that the mass of polyphonic harmony&nbsp;was held together by a general grouping of the rhythmic beats&nbsp;in fours or threes; and individual parts were at least as free&nbsp;to indulge in other rhythms across the main rhythm as they&nbsp;are in the most complex modern music, so long as the harmony&nbsp;was held together by the average grouping, or “ time,” as we&nbsp;now call it. Hence the rhythmic variety of 16th-century</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>1</sup> It would be interesting and fruitful to consider how far the growing preference, In modern European languages,. of accent, to&nbsp;quantity, may not only have modified the Conceptionof musical&nbsp;rhythm, but may itself have been enhanced by the rhythmic tendencies of popular song, which had so great an influence on the learned&nbsp;music of the middle ages. · And it can hardly be said that the&nbsp;subject of musical rhythm has yet been so clearly treated on these&nbsp;lines as to shed the light it seems capable of shedding upon many&nbsp;vexed questions in poetic rhythm.,</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
