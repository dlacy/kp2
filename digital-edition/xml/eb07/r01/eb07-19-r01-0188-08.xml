<p><label>RETFORD</label>
East, a market-town of the county of Nottingham, in the hundred of Bassetlaw, 145 miles from London. It is situated on the river Idle, which runs into the Trent, is well built, has a town-hall, and good market-place well attended every Saturday. It is a corporate town, governed by four aldermen and twelve councillors. It returns two members to the House of Commons ; but on account of prevalent bribery, the right of voting for the borough has been extended to all the freeholders of the county in which it stands. In the neighbourhood are many hop plantations. The chief trade is what arises from the great road. The population amounted in 1801 to 1948, in 1811 to 2030, in 1821-to 2461, and in 1831 to 2491.</p>
