But if the hemorrhagy has fairly taken place, and from arteries of conſiderable ſize, nothing will do but the proper application of ligatures. As the diſcharge in theſe caſes would often prove dangerous before the ſurgeon could be procured, the attendants ſhould be furniſhed with a tourniquet, with directions to apply it, upon the firſt appearance of blood.</p><p>Till of late years the ſcarifying of gun-ſhot wounds was a practice which prevailed very univerſally among ſurgeons; and it was expected by this, that the ſloughs with which wounds are ſometimes covered would ſooner ſeparate, and that the cure would thereby be more readily performed. It is now, however, known, that this practice, inſtead of being uſeful, very generally does harm by increaſing the inflammation. It ſhould therefore be laid entirely aſide. When a gun-ſhot wound cannot eaſily or ſafely be laid open from one end to the other, perhaps it may be proper to introduce a cord through the ſinus. This, however, ſhould not be attempted till the ſirſt or inflammatory ſtate of the wound is over : but when a cord cannot be properly introduced, on account of the ſituation or direction of the wound, compreſſion may prove equally uſeful here as in caſes of punctured wounds.</p><p>Mortification happening after gun-ſhot wounds, is to be treated in the ſame manner as if it had ariſen from any other cauſe, only bark is not to be promiſcuouſly uſed; as, in plethoric habits, it may prove hurtful; though in debilitated relaxed habits it will be extremely uſeful ; but even in ſuch it ſhould never be given while much pain and tenſion continue.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV. <hi rend="italic">Of Poiſoned Wounds.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Poison</hi> may be introduced into the ſyſtem various ways. The effects of the poiſon introduced by the stings of insects may frequently be prevented by applying immediately vinegar or ardent spirits. After inflammation has come on, the moſt effectual remedy is the waſhing the parts with cold water. The bite of a viper is not always dangerous ; but as we can never judge with certainty whether the wound be poiſoned or not, and as the poiſon of this animal acts very ſpeedily upon the ſyſtem, its bad effects ought to be prevented by every poſſible means. The injured part ought either to be cut out immediately, or deſtroyed with the actual or potential cautery.</p><p>Formerly ſuction was much employed, and frequently with ſucceſs : it ſhould not, however, prevent the removal of the part. After the part has been removed, we ſhould endeavour to produce a plentiful ſuppuration. When the poiſon appears to have entered the ſyſtem, the application of warm oil over the whole body has been extolled ; and it has been ſaid that advantage has been derived from the internal uſe of it. From ſome late obſervations, however, the efficacy of this remedy is much to be doubted. Perhaps a plentiful ſweat, kept up for a conſiderable time, is the moſt certain method yet diſcovered. Small doſes of volatile alkali frequently repeated is more to be depended on for producing this effect than any other remedy.</p><p>The bite of a mad animal occaſions the moſt formidable poiſoned wound known in this country. In theſe wounds hydrophobia indeed does not always enſue ; but when it does, death is almoſt certainly the conſequence. A variety of noſtrums for preventing and curing this diſeaſe have been held forth to the public ; but there is ſcarcely any well atteſted fact of any one of them proving uſeful. Nothing yet known can be depended upon but the immediate removal of the injured part, either with the ſcalpel or the actual or potential cautery ; which, together with a plentiful ſuppuration, has, in different inſtances, appeared to anſwer the purpoſe effectually ; at leaſt, patients treated in this manner have escaped, while others bit at the ſame time by the ſame animal have ſuffered. The ſooner the operation is performed, the more effectual it is likely to prove ; but it ought not to he omitted, even though ſome time has elapſed from the time that the wound was inflicted; for there is reaſon to ſuppoſe that this poiſon does not enter the ſyſtem ſo quickly as ſeveral others are obſerved to do. Sea-bathing has been much recommended in all ages as a preventive ; but there are few well atteſted caſes of its being attended with advantage. Many practitioners depend much on mercury ; and as it can be uſed along with any other plan of treatment, it ought not to be neglected,</p><p>When wounds are poiſoned by the application of matter from certain fores, as thoſe of the venereal or cancerous kinds, or ſrom any oſ the vegetable poiſons, it is better to remove the part affected immediately, than to undergo a courſe of medicines generally flow and often doubtful in their operations.</p><p>The metallic poiſons do not fall to be conſidered in this place ; for however deleterious they may be when taken into the ſtomach, they ſeldom appear to be otherwiſe hurtful, when applied to wounds, than by irritating or corroding the parts with which they come in contact.</p><p>CHAP.

For the remote and proximate cauſes of inflammation, together with the treatment of inflammatory diſeaſes, ſee <hi rend="italic">Phlegmasiae,</hi> article <hi rend="smallcaps">Medicine.</hi> Inflammation is commonly divided into two ſpecies, the <hi rend="italic">phlegmonic</hi> and <hi rend="italic">erythematic.</hi> The firſt is diſtinguiſhed by conſiderable ſwelling, throbbing pain, and circumſcribed bright red colour. The second by ſuperficial ſwelling, burning pain, dulled colour, apt to ſpread, diſappearing when pressed, and quickly returning ; the part affected is frequently covered with ſmall veſicles. The conſequences of inflammation are ſuppuration and gangrene, unleſs the inflammation be checked and terminated by reſolution.— That an inflammation will terminate in ſuppuration may be known from the length of time it has continued, from the remiſſion of the pain and hardneſs, the greater elevation of the ſkin in the middle part, a change of colour ſrom red to bluiſh or livid, a slight fever with ſhivering, and from a fluctuation of matter perceived on handling the part.</p><p>During the firſt ſtage of the inflammation; however, we ought, for the moſt part, to endeavour to reſolve it, or prevent the ſuppuration. Yet ſome caſes muſt be excepted. For inſtance, thoſe inflammatory ſwellings which ſometimes occur in fevers, or ſucceed to them, ought always to be brought to ſuppuration ; and it might be very dangerous to attempt a reſolution of them. In ſwellings of a scrophulous nature, it is perhaps beſt to do nothing at all, either with a. view to reſolve or ſuppurate. Thus it might be dangerous to make uſe of repellent applications, at the ſame time that it is by no means adviſable to promote their ſuppuration; the cure of ſuch ſwellings, when opened, proving always very troubleſome ; while at the ſame time it is known, that ſuch ſwellings may remain for a very long time without any riſk to the patient. In the lues venerea, too, as we are posseſſed of a certain antidote for the diſorder, it is beſt not to attempt the ſuppuration of any buboes which may ap-</p></body></text></TEI>
