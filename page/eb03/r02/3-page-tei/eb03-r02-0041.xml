It is therefore a problem of no very difficult ſolu-tion to aſſign the law by which the velocity will gradually diminiſh as the filament recedes from the axis of a cylindrical tube. It is ſomewhat ſurpriſmg that ſo neat a problem has never occupied the attention of the mathematicians during the time that theſe ſubjects were ſo aſſiduouſly ſtudied; but ſo it is, that nothing preciſe has been publiſhed on the ſubject. The only approach to a diſcuſſion of this kind, is a Memoire of Mr Pitot, read to the academy of Paris in 1726, where he conſt-ders the velocity of efflux through a pipe. Here, by attending to the comparative ſiaperiority of the <hi rend="italic">quantity of motion</hi>  in large pipes, he affirms, that the total diminutions ariſing from friction will be (c<hi rend="italic">uteris paribus}</hi>  in the inverſe ratio of the diameters. This was thankfully received by other writers, and is now a part of our hydraulic theories. It has not, however, been attended to by thoſe who. write on the motion of rivers, though it is evident that it is applicable to theſe With equal propriety ; and had it been introduced, it would at once have ſolved all their difficulties, and particularly would have ſhown how an almoſt imperceptible declivity would produce the gentle motion of a great river, without having recourſe to the unintelligible principle of Guglielmini.</p><p>Mr Couplet made ſome experiments on the motion of the water in the great main pipes of Verſailles, in order to obtain ſome notions of the retardations occaſioned by friction. They were found prodigious; but were ſo irregular, and unſuſceptible of reduction to any general principle, (and the experiments were indeed ſo few that they were unfit for this reduction), that he could eſta-bliſh no theory.—What Mr Belidor eſtabliſhed on them, and makes a ſort of ſyſtem to direct future engineers, is quite unworthy of attention.</p><p>Upon the whole, this branch of hydraulics, although of much greater practical importance than the conduct of water in pipes, has never yet obtained more than a vague, and, we may call it, ſlovenly attention from the mathematicians ; and we aſcribe it to their not having taken the pains to fettle its firſt principles with the fame precifion as had been done in the other branch. They were, from the beginning, ſatisſied with a ſort of applicability of mathematical principles, without ever making the application. Were it not that ſome would accuſe us of national partiality, we would aſcribe it to this, that Newton had not pointed out the way in this as in the other branch. For any intelligent reader of the performances on the motions of fluids in cloſe veſ-ſels, will fee that there has not a principle, nay hardly a ſtep of inveſtigation, been added to thoſe which were uſed or pointed out by Sir Iſaac Newton. He has nowhere touched this queſtion, the motion of water in an open canal. In his theories of the tides, and of the propagation of waves, he had an excellent opportunity for giving at once the fundamental principles of motion in a free fluid whoſe ſurface was not horizontal But, by means of ſome of thoſe happy and ſhrewd. gueſſes, in which, as Daniel Bernoulli ſays, he excelled all men, he ſaw the undoubted conſequences of ſome palpable phenomenon which would anſwer all his preſent. pur-poſes, and therefore entered no far ther into the inveſtigation.</p><p>The original theery of Guglielmini, or the principle adopted by him, that each particle of the vertical lec</p><lb/><p>tion of a running ſtream has ä tendency to move as if it were iſſuing from an orifice at that depth under the ſurface, is falſe ; and that it really does ſo in the face of a dam when the flood-gate is taken .away, is no leſs ſo ; and if it did, the ſubſequent motions would hardly have any reſemblance to thoſe which he aſſigns them. Were this the caſe, the exterior form of the caſcade would be ſomething like what is ſltetched in fig. 3. with an abrupt angle at B, and a concave ſurface BEG. This will be evident to every one who combines the greater velocity of the lower filaments with the flower motion of thoſe which muſt Aide down above them. But this greater advance of the lower filaments cannot take place without an expenditure of the water under the ſurface AB. The ſurface therefore finks, and B inſtantly ceaſes to retain its place in the horizontal plane. The water does not ſucceſſively flow forward from A to B<hi rend="sub">s</hi>, and then tumble over the precipice ; but immediately upon opening the flood-gate, the water waſtes from the ſpace immediately behind it, and the whole puts on the form reprefented in fig. 4. conſiſtſhg of the curve AαPfEG, convex from A to c, and concave from thence forward. The ſuperficial water begins to accelerate all the way from A ; and the particles may be ſuppoſed (for the preſent) to have acquired the velocity correſponding to their depth under the horizontal fur» face. This muſt be underſtood as nothing more than a vague ſketch of the motions. It requires a very critical and intricate inveſtigation to determine either the form of the upper curve or the motions of the different filaments. The place A, where the curvature begins, is of equally difficult determination, and is various according to the differences of depth and of inclination 1 of the ſucceeding canal.</p><p>We have given this ſort of hiſtory of the progreſs which had been made in this part of hydraulics, that our readers might form ſome opinion of the many diſ-ſertations which have been written on the motion of rivers, and of the ſtate of the arts depending on it. Much of the buſineſs of the civil engineer is intimately connected with it : and we may therefore believe, that ſince there was ſo little principle in the theories, there could be but very little certainty in the practical operations. The fact has been, that no engineer could pretend to ſay, with any precifion, what would be the effect of his operations. One whoſe buſineſs had given him many opportunities, and who kept accurate and judicious regiſters of his own works, could pronounce, with ſome probability, how much water would be brought off by a drain of certain dimenſions and a given Hope, when the circumſtances of the caſe happened to tally with ſome former work in which he had ſuc-ceeded or failed ; but out of the pale of his own experience·, he could only make a ſagacious gueſs. A remarkable inſtance of this occurred not long ago. A ſmall aqueduct was lately carried into Paris. It had been conducted on a plan preſented to the academy, who had corrected it, and gave a report of what its performance would be. When executed in the molt accurate manner, it was deficient in the proportion of five to nine. When the celebrated Deſaguliers was employed by the city of Edinburgh to ſuperintend the bringing in the water for the ſupply of the city, he gave a report , on the plan which was to be followed. It was executed to his complete ſatisfaction ; and the quantity of</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
