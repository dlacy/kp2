<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">different claſs from thoſe which enthufiafm and impoſ-ture have fabricated among other nations. See Mira-cle and Prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But as the evidence of the divine origin of the prirnse-val religion reſts particularly on the authority of the firſt five books of the old Teſtament, it may be thought&nbsp;incumbent on us to ſupport our reaſoning on this ſubject, by proving, that the author of thoſe books was&nbsp;indeed inſpired by God. This we ſhall endeavour to&nbsp;do by one decifive argument ; for the nature of the ar-ticle, and the limits preſcribed us, admit not of our en-tering into a minute detail of all that has been written&nbsp;on the divine legation of Moſes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If the miracles recorded in the book of Exodus, and the other writings of the Hebrew lawgiver, were really&nbsp;performed ; if the ſirſt-born of the Egyptians were all cut&nbsp;off in one night, as is there related ; and if the children&nbsp;of Iſrael paſſed through the Red fea, the waters being&nbsp;divided, and forming a wall on their right hand and on&nbsp;their left—it muſt neceffarily be granted, that Moſes was&nbsp;ſent by God ; becauſe nothing leſs than a divine power&nbsp;was ſufficient to perform ſuch wonderful works. But&nbsp;he who ſuppoſes that thoſe works were never performed,&nbsp;muſt affirm that the books recording them were</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">forged,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">either at the era in which the miracles are ſaid to have&nbsp;been wrought, or at ſome ſubſequent era : There is no&nbsp;other alternative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That they could not be </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">forged</span><span class="font0"> at the era in which they affirm the miracles to have been wrought, a very&nbsp;few reflections will make incontrovertibly evident. Theſe&nbsp;books inform the people forwhoſe uſe they were written,&nbsp;that their author, after having inflicted various plagues&nbsp;upon Pharaoh and his ſubjects, brought them, to the&nbsp;number of 600,coo, out of Egypt with a high hand ;&nbsp;that they were led by a pillar of cloud through the day,&nbsp;and by a pillar of fire through the night, to the brink&nbsp;of the Red fea, where they were almoſt overtaken by&nbsp;the Egyptians, who had purſued them with chariots&nbsp;and horſes ; that, to make a way for their eſcape, Mofes&nbsp;ſtretchcd out'his rod over the ſea, which was immediately divided, and permitted them to paſs through on dry&nbsp;ground, between two walls of water ; and that the E-gyptians, purfuing and going in after them to the midſt&nbsp;of the ſea, were all drowned by the return of the waterε&nbsp;to their uſual ſtate, as ſoon as the Hebrews arrived at&nbsp;the further ſhore. Is it poſſible now that Moſes or any&nbsp;other man could have perſuaded 600,000 perſons, however barbarous and illiterate we ſuppoſe them, that they&nbsp;had been witneffes of all theſe wonderful works, if no&nbsp;ſuch works had been performed ? Could any art or elo-quence perſuade all the inhabitants of Edinburgh- and&nbsp;Leith, that, they had ycſterday walked on dry ground&nbsp;through the Frith to Kinghorn, the waters being di-vided and forming a wall on their right hand and on their&nbsp;left ? If this queſtion muſt be anſwered in the negative,&nbsp;it is abſolutely impoſſible that the books of Moſes, ſup-poſing them to have been forged, could have been re-ceived by the people who were alive when thoſe won-ders are ſaid to have becn wrought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let us now inquire, whether, if they be forgeries, they could have been received as authentic at any ſub-ſequent period ; and we ſhall ſoon find this ſuppoſition&nbsp;as impoſſible as the former. The books claiming Moſes&nbsp;for their author fpeak of themfelves as delivered by him,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">and from his days </span><span class="font0">kept </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">in the ark.</span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">the covenant *j an</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">ark which, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">upon </span><span class="font0">this ſuppofition, had no </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">exiſtence </span><span class="font0">prior to the forgery. They ſpeak of themſelves likewiſe, not&nbsp;only as. a hiſtory of miracles wrought by their author,&nbsp;but as the ſtatutes or municipal law of the nation, of&nbsp;which a copy was to be always in the poſſeſſion of the&nbsp;prieſts, and another in that of the ſupreme magiſtrate J.&nbsp;Now, in whatever age we ſuppoſe theſe books to have&nbsp;been forged, they could not poffibly be received as au-thentic ; becauſe no copy of them could then be found'&nbsp;either with the king, with the prieſts, or in the ark,&nbsp;though, as they contain the ſtatute law of the land, it&nbsp;is not conceivable that, if they had exiſted, they could&nbsp;have been kept ſecret. Could any man, at this day,&nbsp;forge a book of ſtatutes for England or Scotland, and&nbsp;make it paſs upon theſe nations for the only book of&nbsp;ſtatutes which they had ever known ? was there ever&nbsp;ſince the world began a book of ſham ſtatutes, and theſe,&nbsp;too, multifarious and burdenſome, impoſed upon any&nbsp;people as the only ſtatutes by which they and their farthers had been governed for ages ? Such a forgery is&nbsp;evidently impoſſible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the books of Moſes have internal proofs of au-thenticity, which no other books of ancient ſtatutes e-ver had. They not only contain the laws, but alſo give an hiſtorical aecount of their enactment, and the reaſons&nbsp;upon which they were founded. Thus they tell us¢, that&nbsp;the rite of circumciſion was inſtituted as a mark of the&nbsp;covenant between God and the founder of the Jewiſh&nbsp;nation, and that the practice of it was enforced by the&nbsp;declaration of the Almighty, that every uncircumcifed&nbsp;man-child ſhould be cut off from his people. They in-form us that the annual ſolemnity of the paffover waβ&nbsp;inſtituted in commemoration of their deliverance when&nbsp;God flew, in one night, all the firſt-born of the Egyp-tians ; that the firſt-born of Iſrael, both of men and&nbsp;beaſt, were on the fame occaſion dedicated ſor ever to&nbsp;God, who took the Levites inſtead of the firſt-born of&nbsp;the men ſ; that this tribe was conſecrated as prieſts, by&nbsp;whoſe hands alone the ſacrifices of the people were to&nbsp;be offered ; that it was death for any perſon of a different tribe to approach the altar, or even to touch the ark&nbsp;of the covenant ; and that Aaron’s budding rod was&nbsp;kept in the ark in memory of the wonderful deſtruction&nbsp;of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, for their rebellion a-gainſt the prieſthood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Is it poſſible now, if all thefe things hadnot been practiſed among the Hebrews from the era of Moſes,&nbsp;with a retroſpect to the ſignal mercies which they are&nbsp;ſaid to commemorate, that any man or body of men&nbsp;could have perſuaded a whole nation, by means of forged books, that they had always religiouſly obſerved&nbsp;ſuch inſtitutions ? Could it have been poſſible, at any period poſterior to the Exodus, to perſuade the Iſraelites&nbsp;that they and their fathers had all been circumciſed on&nbsp;the eighth day from their birth, if they had been confcious themfelves that they had never been circumciſed&nbsp;at all? or that the paffover was kept in memory of their&nbsp;deliverance from Egyptian bondage, if no ſuch feſtival&nbsp;was known among them ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But let us ſuppoſe that circumciſion had been practiſed, and all their ether ritcs and ceremonies obſerved from time immemorial, without their knowing any reaſon of fuch inſtitutions ; ſtill it muſt be confeſſed that&nbsp;the forger of theſe books, if they </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">were</span><span class="font0"> forged, conſtructed his </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">narrative in </span><span class="font0">ſuch </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a manner as that </span><span class="font0">no man</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
