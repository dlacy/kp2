a city of the grand duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, which was formerly the capital of the two duchies of Mecklenburg, but since 1695 it has become the sole possession of the present branch. It is situated on the navigable river Wornow, about eight miles from the Baltic Sea. It is strongly fortified, and contains a citadel, seven churches, 2180 houses of an antique style of building, and about 16,000 inhabitants. It is the place at which the assembly of the states, and the courts of law, are held ; and it contains a university founded in 1419, which has a due number of professors, and about a hundred students, to which are attached an observatory, an anatomical theatre, and a library of thirty thousand volumes. It is the most considerable trading place in the German part of the Baltic, and the export of wheat is greater than from any other German port. It has a variety of manufactures for brandy, vinegar, beer, cloths, glass, leather, iron ware, soap, sugar, and linen, and 140 ships belonging to the port. This place gave birth to Prince Blucher, to whom a statue has been erected in the square. Long. 12. 32. E. Lat. 54. 10. N.</p>
