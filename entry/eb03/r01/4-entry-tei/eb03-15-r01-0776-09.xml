<p><label>RAJA</label>
the title of the Indian black princes, the re-mains of thoſe who ruled there before the Moguls. Some of the rajas are ſaid to preferve their independen-cy, efpecially in the mountainous parts ; but moſt of them pay an annual tribute to the Mogul. The Indians call them <hi rend="italic">rai ;</hi> the Perfians, <hi rend="italic">raian,</hi> in the plural ; and our travellers <hi rend="italic">rajas,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ragias.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Raja, the</hi> <hi rend="italic">Ray-F'ιjh,</hi> in ichthyology; a genus be-longing to the order of Chondropterygia. There are five fpiracula below towards the peak ; the body compreffed ; and the mouth is ſituated under the head. The moſt remarkable ſpecies are,</p><p>I. The batis, or ſkate : this ſpecies is the thinncſt in proportion to its bulk of any of the genus, and alſo the largeſt, fome weighing near 200 pounds. The noſe, though not long, is ſharp pointed ; above the eyes is a fet of ſhort ſpines: the upper part is of a pale brown, fometimes ſtreaked with black : tbe lower part is white, marked with great numbers of minute black, ſpots. The jaws are covered with ſmall granulated but ſharp-pointed teeth. The tail is of a moderate length : near the end are two fins : along the top of it is one row of ſpines, and on the edges are irregularly diſperſed a few others, which makes us imagine with Mr Ray, that in thia reſpect theſe fiſh vary, ſome having one, others more orders of ſpines on the tail. It is remarked, that in the males of this ſpecies the fins arc full of fpines. Skates generate in March and April ; at which time they ſwim near the ſurface of the water, ſeveral of the males purſuing one female. They adhcre ſo faſt together in coition, that the fiſher-men frequently draw up both together, though only one has taken the bait. The females begin to caſt their <hi rend="italic">purſes,</hi> as the ſiſhermen call them (the bags in which the young are included) in May, and continue doing it till September. In october they are exceedingly poor and thin ; but in November they begin to improve, and grow gradually better till May, when they are in the higheſt perfection. The males go ſooner out of ſeaſon than the females.</p><p>2. The oxyrinchus, or ſharp-noſed ray, in length near feven feet, and breadth five feet two inches ; when juſt brought on ſhore, it makes a remarkable fnorting noiſe·. The noſe is very long, narrow, and ſharp-pointed, not unlike the end of a ſpontoon. The body is ſmooth, and very thin in proportion to the fize ; the upper part aſh-coloured, ſpotted with numerous white ſpots, and a few black ones. The tail is thick ; towards the end are two ſmall fins ; on each fide is a row of ſmall ſpines, with another row in the middle, which runs ſome way up the back. The lower part of the fiſn is quite white. The mouth is very large, and furniſhed with numbers of ſmall ſharp teeth bending inwards. This ſiſh has been ſuppoled to be the <hi rend="italic">los</hi> of the anci-3</p>

<p>ents ; which was certainly ſome enormous ſpecies of ray, though we cannot pretend to determine the par-ticular kind, ûppian ſtyles it, <hi rend="italic">the broadefi among ffhes:</hi> he adds an account of its fondnefs of human fleſh, and the method it takes of deſtroying men, by over-laying and keeping them down by its vaſt weight till they are drowned. Phile <hi rend="italic">(De propriet. anim.</hi> p. 85.J gives much the ſame relation. We are inclined to give them credit, ſince a modern writer, of undoubted autho-rity *, gives the very ſame account of a fiſh found in the South Seas, the terror of thoſe employed in the pearl.ſiſhery. It is a ſpecies of ray, called there <hi rend="italic">manta,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">quilt,</hi> from its ſurrounding and wrapping up the unhappy divers till they are ſuffocated ; there-fore the negroes never go down without a ſharp knife to defend themſelves againſt the affaults of this terrible enemy.</p><p>3. The aſpera, or rough ray, is found in Loch-Broom in Scotland. The length from the noſe to the tip of the tail is two feet nine. The tail is almoſt of the ſame length with the body. The noſe is very ſhort. Before each eye is a large hooked ſpine ; and behind each another, beſet with leſſer. The upper part of the body is of a cinereous brown mixed with white, and ſpotted with black; and entirely covered with fmall ſpines. Οη the tail are three rows of great ſpines : all the reſt of the tail is irregularly bεfet with leſſer. The fins and under fide of the body are equally rough with the upper. The teeth are flat and rhυmboidal.</p><p>4. The fullonica, or fuller, derives its Latin name from the inſtrument fullers make uſe of in ſmoothing cloth, the back being rough and ſpiney. The noſe is ſhort and ſharp. At the corner of each eye are a few ſpines. The membrane of nictitation is fringed. Teeth ſmall and ſharp. Οη the upper part of the pectoral fins are three rows of ſpines pointing towards the back, crooked like thoſe on a fuller’s inſtrument. Οη the tail are three rows of ſtrong ſpines: the middle row reaches up part of the back. The tail is ſlender, and rather longer than the body. The colour of the upper part of the body is cinereous, marked uſually with numerous black ſpots : the lower part is white. This, as well as moſt other ſpecies of rays, vary a little in colour, ac-cordιng to age. <hi rend="sup">r</hi> Fhιs grows to a iιze equal to the ſkate» It is common at Scarborough, where it is called the <hi rend="italic">white hans,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">gullet.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">ζ.</hi> The ſhagreen ray increaſes to the ſize of the ſkate; is fond of launces or ſand-eels, which it takes generally as a bait. The form is narrower than that of the common kinds ; the noſe long and very ſharp ; pupil of the eye ſapphirine; on the noſe are two ſhort rows of ſpines; on the corner oſ the eyes another of a ſemicircular form; on the tail are two rows, continued a little up the back, ſmall, ſlender, and very ſharp : along the ſides of the tail is a row of minute ſpines, intermixed with innumerable little fpiculæ. The upper part of the body is of a cinereous brown, covered cloſely with ſhagreen-like tubercles, reſembling'the ſkin of the dog-fiſh: the under fide of the body is white ; from the noſe to the begin-ning of the pectoral fins is a tubercπlated ſpace. The teeth ſlender, and ſharp as needles.</p><p>6. The torpedo, cramp-ſiſh, or electric ray, is frequently taken in Torbay : has been once caught off Pembroke, and ſometimes near waterford in Ireland. It is generally taken, like other flat ſiſh, with the trawl ; but there is an inſtance of its taking the bait. It com-</p><p>monly lies in water of about 40 fathoms depth ; and m company with the congenerous rays. The. torpedo, brings forth its yo&lt;ung at the autumnal equinox, as affirmed by Ariſtotle. A gentleman of La Rochelle, on diffecting certain females of this fpecies, the 10th of September, found in the matrices ſeveral of the fcetuſes quite formed, and nine eggs in no ſtate of forwardnefs : ſuperfcetation ſeems therefore to be a property of this fiſh-The food of the torpedo is fiſh ; a ſurmullet and a plaife have been found in the ſtomach of two of them. The fur-mullet is a fiſh of that ſwiftnefs, that it was impoffible for the torpedo to take it by purſuit. It is probable, therefore, that by their electric ſtroke they ſtupify their prey ; yet the crab and ſea-leech will venture to annoy them. They will live 24 hours out of the fea; and but very little longer if placed in freſh water. They inha-bit fandy places ; and will bury themfelves ſuperſicially in it, by flinging the ſand over, by a quick flapping of all the extremities. It is in this ſituation that the tor-pedo gives his moſt forcible ſhock, which throws down the aſtoniſhed paffenger who inadvertently treads upon him. In our ſeas it grows to a great ſize, and above 80 pounds weight. The tail is thick and round ; the caudal fin broad and abrupt. The head and body, which are indiſtinct, are nearly round ; attenuating to extreme thinneſs on the edges ; below the body, the ventral fins form on each ſide a quarter of a circle. The two dorſal fins are placed on a trunk of the tail. The eyes are ſmall, placed near each other : behind each is a round ſpiracle, with fix ſmall cutaneous rags on their in-ner circumference. Mouth ſmall ; teeth minute, ſpicu-lar. Five openings to the gills, as in others of this ge-nus. The ſkin everywhere ſmooth ; cinereous brown above, white beneath. See further the article Elec-tricitv, n <hi rend="sup">o</hi> 258 — 261.</p><p>7. The clavata, or thornback, is eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the others by the rows of ſtrong ſharp ſpines diſ-poſed along the back and tail. In a large one ſeen by Mr Pennant, were three rows on the back, and five on the tail, all inclining towards its end. Οη the noſe, and on the inner ſide of the forehead, near the eyes, were a few ſpines, and others were ſcattered without any order on the upper part of the pectoral fins. The mouth was ſmall, and filled with granulated teeth : The upper part of the body was oſ a pale aſh colour, mark-ed with ſhort ſtreaks of black, and the ſkin rough, with ſmall tubercles like ſhagreen. The belly white, croffed with a ſtrong ſemilunar cartilage beneath the lkin : in general, the lower part was ſmooth, having only a few ſpines on each ſide. The young ſiſh have very few ſpines on them ; and their backs are often ſpotted with white, and each ſpot is encircled with black. This ſpecie-s frequents our ſandy ſhores; are very voracious, and feed on all forts of flat fiſh ; are particularly fond of herrings and ſand-eels ; and ſometimes eat cruſtaceous animals, ſuch as crabs. Thefe ſometimes weigh 14 or 15 pounds, but with us ſeldom exceed that freight. They begin to generate in June, and bring forth their young in Ju-Iy and Auguſt, which (as well as thofe of the ſkate) be-fore they are old enough to breed, are called <hi rend="italic">maids.</hi> The thornback begins to be in ſeaſon in November, and con-tinues ſo later than the ſkate, but the young of both are good at all times of the year.</p><p>8. The paſtinaca, or ſting ray, does not grow to the bulk of the others : The body is quite ſmooth, of ſhape almoſt round, and is of a much greater thickneſs and</p>

<p>more elevated form in the middle than any other rays, but grows thin towards the edges. The noſe is very ſharp pointed, but ſhort ; the mouth fmall, and filled with granulated teeth. The irides are of a gold colour: behind each eye the orifice is very large. The tail is very thick at the beginning : the ſpine is placed about a third the length of the former from the body; is about five inches long, flat on the top and bottom, very hard, ſharp pointed, and the two ſides thin, and clofely and ſharply bearded the whole Way. The tail extends four inches beyond the end of this ſpine, and grows very deader at the extremity. Theſe ſiſh are obſerved to ſhed their ſpine, and renew them annually ; ſometimes the new ſpine appears before the old one drops off ; and the Corniſh call this fpecies <hi rend="italic">cardinal trilofi,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">three-tailed,</hi> when ſo circumſtanced. The colour of the upper part of the body is a dirty yellow, the middle part of an obſcure blue : the lower fide white, the tail and ſpine duſky. The weapon with which nature has aimed this fiſh, hath ſupplied the ancients with many tremendous fables relating to it. Pliny, Ælian, and Qppian, have given it a venom that affects even the inanimate creation : trees that are ſtruck by it inſtantly loſe their verdure and periſh, and rocks themfelves are incapable of refilling the potent poiſon. The enchantreſs Circe armed her ſon with a ſpear headed with the ſpine of the trygon, as the moſt irreſiſtible weapon ſhe could furniſh him witjj, ; and with which he afterwards committed parricide, unintentionally, on his lather Ulyſſes. That fpear⅛ and darts might, in very early times, have been headed with this bone inſtead of iron, we have no kind of doubt ; that of another fpecies of this ſiſh being ſtill ufed to point the arrows of ſome of the South American Indians, and is, from its hardneſs, ſharpneſs, and beards, a moſt dreadful weapon. But in reſpect to its venomous qualities, there is not the leaſt credit to be given to the opinion, though it was believed (as far as it affected the animal world) by Rondeletius, Aldro-vand, and others, and even to this day by the fiſhermen in ſeveral parts of the kingdom. It is in fact the wea-pon of offence belonging to the fiſh, capable of giving a very bad wound, and which is attended with dangerous ſymptoms when it falls on a tendinous part or on a perfon in a bad habit of body. As to any fiſh having a ſpine charged with actual poifon, it ſeems very dubious, though the report is ſanctified by the name of Linnæus. He inſtances the <hi rend="italic">paftiηaca,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">torpedo,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">tetrodon (meatus.</hi> The firſt is incapable of conveying a greater injury than what reſults from the mere wound ; the ſecond, from its electric effluvia ; and the third, by imparting a pungent pain like the ſting of nettles, occaſioned by the minute ſpines on its abdomen.</p>
