<p><label>RUNNIMEDE</label>
or Runnymede, a meadow on the S. bank of the river Thames, England, in the county of Surrey and the parish of Egham. It is celebrated in connexion with the signature of Magna Carta <hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> by King John on the 15th of June 1215. It has been disputed whether the ceremony took place actually in the meadow or on Magna Carta or Charter Island lying off it. The charter itself indicates Runnimede by name, but this may have included the island, which is the traditional site and was in 1217 the meeting-place of Henry III. and Louis (afterwards Louis VIII.) of France.</p>
