After passing through the usual preparatory studies, Rabelais was admitted into the order of Cordeliers at the convent of Fontenay-le-Compte in Poitou, where he assumed the religious habit. Here he prosecuted his studies with such zeal, as to retrieve any loss of time which indifference or injudicious tutors might previously have occasioned. Striking out of the usual routine of scholastic study, which then held undivided sway in the monastic houses, he applied himself, with unusual industry and research, to the cultivation of the sciences It was his aim, says Niceron, to become a grammarian, poet, philosopher, physician, jurisconsult, and astronomer, and his works bear ample testimony to his success. He possessed a peculiar aptitude for the acquisition of the languages ; an aptitude which afterwards showed itself in his command of Italian, Spanish, German, English, Hebrew, and Arabic. At this period, in fact, he was a perfect master of the Latin and Greek tongues, the latter of which had for some time been engaging the attention of the most enlightened spirits of the age. Within the walls of Fontenay-le-Compte, however, a Greek book was looked upon as no better than a work of magic, and the man who commanded the key to its secrets passed for a trafficker in “ the arts inhibited ;” and it appears, by a letter from Budæus to a friend, that Rabelais’ attachment to the Greek writers drew upon him the hatred and persecution of his fellow monks. His independence of spirit, and generous ardour in the pursuit of learning, which could not but be felt as a reproach to their own resolute ignorance, pedantry, and sloth, was continually furnishing fresh incentives to their rancour, and they omitted no opportunity of subjecting him to annoyance. Worn out by repeated aggressions, he followed the advice of his friends, and resolved to quit a society where he found so little that was congenial to his own disposition. It has been alleged, that the true cause of this step was his own profligacy ; but this is only the first of the many groundless charges against him, engendered either by the malice of his enemies, or originating in a misapprehension of his character as seen in his writings, namely, that of a man whose whole life was a noisy jest, a soulless round of sensual indulgences. Had such really been his character, as has been pertinently remarked by Père</p><p>Niceron, “ these were not the days, when, for such a cause, he needed to have left his monastery ; he might have given free rein to his propensities there, and yet not have been going out of the ordinary course.” The authority of a churchman on such a point is conclusive.</p><p>In 1523, a brief was obtained from Pope Clement VII., allowing him to pass from the order of St. Francis into that of St. Benedict, and leaving this “pack of capuchins, monks, who forbade the use of beans, that is, Pantagrueline books,” to borrow a phrase from the prologue to the fifth book of his Romance, he entered the monastery of Maillezais in Poitou, where he remained during several years. But he appears to have found himself little better off in his present situation, than in that which he had left. It did not present him, it is said, with such resources as he desired for extending the limits of his knowledge, more especially as regarded medical science. His motives for this step were doubtless of a mingled nature, of which it is but reasonable to suppose the chief was a disgust at the torpor and profitless seclusion of a monastic life, by escaping from which he could alone hope to find opportunities for exercising his stirring and strongly practical intellect in a field of action, observation, and experience, sufficiently ample for its desires. How<hi rend="sup">,</hi>ever this may be, he laid down the regular habit for that of a secular priest, and quitted Maillezais without the sanction of his superior, a breach of ecclesiastical discipline which exposed him to its severest censures. After rambling about for some time in the diligent pursuit of medical knowledge, as he says himself in his petition to Pope' Paul III. praying for absolution from the penalties incurred by his unauthorised retirement from Maillezais, he settled at Montpellier, after taking his physician’s degree at its university, and practised the medical profession there with credit and success. It appears by the dedication to Godefroy D’Estissac, bishop of Maillezais, of an edition of Hippocrates’s<hi rend="italic">Aphorisms,</hi>  and the <hi rend="italic">Ars Parva</hi>  of Galen, published by Rabelais in 1532, at Lyons, and highly esteemed by the medical and literary men of the time, that his lectures on physic at the university of that place had attracted considerable attention. Such, indeed, was the distinction he attained, that he was selected by tile university as their deputy to procure a restitution of the privileges of which one of its colleges had been denuded by the chancellor Du Prat. The means employed by Rabelais for obtaining access to the chancellor have formed the subject of a story to be found in all his biographies ; but it is too obviously a fabrication from an incident in his own Romance, (the introduction of Panurge to Pantagruel, book ii. c. ix.) to be worth a place here. He succeeded in the object of his mission, and his services to the university were perpetuated in a custom, still, according to the <hi rend="italic">Biographie Universelle,</hi>  in existence, by which every candidate is required to put on Rabelais’ gown upon receiving his physician’s degree.</p><p>In 1533, we find him established at Lyons, where he was hospital physician, and taught and practised for several years. At the commencement of the year 1534, his old schoolfellow and friend, Jean du Bellay, then bishop of Paris, having occcasion to pass through Lyons on his way to the papal court, regarding the divorce of Henry VIII. of England, took Rabelais along with him in the capacity of his physician ; thus enabling him to realise, what had long been his passionate wish, a personal acquaintance with Italy and the Eternal City. For, to use the words of his dedication to Du Bellay of an edition of Marliani’s <hi rend="italic">Typogra-phia Antiquae Romœ,</hi>  published, under Rabelais’ superintendence, by Gryphius, at Lyons, in 1534, “ from the first moment that I was able to appreciate the worth of polite learning, it was amongst the foremost of my desires to travel throughout Italy, and visit the capital of the Roman world.” The opportunity for gratifying the popular conceptions of his character, afforded by this visit of the great satirist of the abuses of the Romish church to the court of its supreme head, has not been let slip by the anecdote-mongers ; and several absurd stories of his conduct have accordingly been handed down from biographer to biographer, till they seem almost to have acquired the authority of undoubted truths. One specimen of these will be sufficient. When the Cardinal Du Bellay was presented to the Pope, he, as ambassador of Francis I., went through the usual ceremony of kissing his holiness’s slipper. His suite followed his example, all except Rabelais, who remained leaning against a pillar, and exclaimed loud enough to be heard, That if his master, who was a great lord in France, were unworthy to kiss the pope's feet, his holiness might untruss, and possibly, after reasonable abstersion, a part might be found, where an humble follower like himself might presume to apply his lips. The improbability, that Rabelais should have expressed himself in these terms, filling the situation which he did, and when, too, he was on the eve of supplicating a release from this very pope from the ecclesiastical penalties he had incurred by his unauthorised desertion of the monastery Of Maillezais, speaks sufficiently for the worthlessness of this story. But its real source is obvious enough, and may be found in book iv. c. 48. of his Romance. It needed but a poor invention to construct such a tale out of the extravagant devotion of the worthies that greeted Pantagruel and his band, on their arrival at the Island of Papimany. That, however, which, as told by Rabelais himself, is a stroke of the most caustic satire,</p></body></text></TEI>
