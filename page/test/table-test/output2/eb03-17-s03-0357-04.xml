(William), an admired Engliſh poet, the eldest ſon of a plain country gentleman, who farmed his own eſtate in Shropſhire, was born in November 1714. He learned to read of an old dame, whom his poem of the “ School miſtreſs” has delivered to posterity ; and ſoon received ſuch delight from books, that he was always calling for new entertainment, and expected that, when any of the family went to market, a new book ſhould be brought him, which, when it came, was in fondneſs carried to bed, and laid by him. It is laid, that when his requeſt had been neglected, his mother wrapped up a piece of wood of the same form, and pacified him for the night. As he grew older, he went for a while to the grammar-ſchool in Hales-Owen, and was placed afterwards with Mr- Crumpton, an eminent ſchool matter at Solihul, where he diſtinguiſhed himſelf by the quickneſs of his progreſs. When he was young (June 1774), he was deprived of his father ; and ſoon after (August 1726) of his grandfather ; and was, with his brother, who died afterwards unmarried, left to the care of his grandmother, who managed the eſtate. From ſchool he was ſent, in 1732, to Pembroke college in Oxford, a ſociety which for half a century has been eminent for Engliſh poetry and elegant literature. Here it appears that he found delight and advantage ; for he continued his name there ten years, though he took no degree. After the firſt four years he put on the civilian’s gown, but without Awing any intention to engage in the profeſſion. About the time when he went to Oxford, the death of his grandmother devolved his affairs to the care of the reverend Mr Dolman, of Brome, in Staffordſhire, whoſe attention he always mentioned with gratitude. — At Oxford he applied to Engliſh poetry ; and, in 1737, publiſhed a ſmall Miſcellany, without his name. He then for a time wandered about, to acquaint himſelf with life, and was ſometimes at London, ſometimes at Bath, or any place of public reſort ; but he did not forget his poetry. He publiſhed, in 1740, his “ Judgment of Hercules,” addreſſed to Mr Lyttleton, whoſe intereſt he ſupported with great warmth at an election ; this was two years afterwards followed by the “ School-miſtreſs.” Mr Dolman, to whoſe care he was indebted for his eaſe and leiſure, died in 1745, and the care of his fortune now fell upon himſelf. He tried to eſcape it a while, and lived at his houſe with his tenants, who were diſtantly related ; but, finding that imperfect posseſſion inconvenient, he took the whole eſtate into his own hands, an event which rather improved its beauty than increaſed its produce. Now began his delight in rural pleaſures, and his paſſion of rural elegance ; but in time his expences<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0364.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0358"/>
occaſioned clamours that overpowered the lamb’s bleat and the linnet’s ſong, and his groves were haunted by beings very different from fawns and fairies. He ſpent his eſtate in adorning it, and his death was probably haſtened by his anxieties. He was a lamp that ſpent its oil in blazing. It is ſaid, that if he had lived a little longer, he would have been aſſiſted by a penſion ; such bounty could not have been more properly beſtowed, but that it was ever aſked is not certain ; it is too certain that it never was enjoyed.— He died at the Leaſowes, of a putrid fever, about five on Friday morning, Feb. II. 1763 ; and was buried by the side of his brother, in the churchyard of Hales- Owen.</p><p>In his private opinions, our author adhered to no particular ſect, and hated all religious diſputes. Tenderneſs, in every ſenſe of the word, was his peculiar characteriſtic ; and his friends, domeſtics, and poor neighbours, daily experienced the effects of his benevolence. This virtue he carried to an exceſs that ſeemed to border upon weakneſs ; yet if any of his friends treated him ungenerouſly, he was not eaſily reconciled. On such occaſions, however, he uſed to say, “ I never will be a revengeful enemy ; but I cannot, it is not in my nature, to be half a friend.” He was no economiſt ; for the generoſity of his temper prevented his paying a proper regard to the uſe of money : he exceeded therefore the bounds of his paternal fortune. But, if we conſider the perfect paradiſe into which he had converted his eſtate, the hospitality with which he lived, his charities to the indigent, and all out of an eſtate that did not exceed 300 l. a-year, one ſhould rather wonder that he left any thing behind him, than blame his want of economy : he yet left more than ſufficient to pay all his debts, and by his will appropriated his whole eſtate to that purpoſe. Though he had a high opinion of many of the fair ſex, he forbore to marry. A paſſion he entertained in his youth was with difficulty ſumounted. The lady was the ſubject of that admirable paſtoral, in four parts, which has been ſo univerſally and ſo juſtly admired, and which, one would have thought, muſt have ſoftened the proudeſt and moſt obdurate heart. His works have been publiſhed by Mr Dodſley, in 3 vols 8vo. The firſt volume contains his poetical works, which are particularly diſtinguiſhed by an amiable elegance and beautiful simplicity ; the second volume contains his proſe works ; the third his letters, &amp; c. <hi rend="italic">Biographical Dictionary.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
