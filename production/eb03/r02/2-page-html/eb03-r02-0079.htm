To a gentleman qualified as was&nbsp;the Chevalier de Buat, ſuch a collection would be ineſ-timable, and might ſuggeſt a theory as far ſuperior to&nbsp;his as he has gone before all other writers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">We ſhall conclude this article with ſome obſervations on the methods which may be taken for rendering ſmall&nbsp;</span><span class="font0"><sup>ς</sup> rivers and brooks fit for inland navigation, or at leaſt&nbsp;for floatage. We get much inſtruction on this ſubject&nbsp;from what has been ſaid concerning the ſwell produced&nbsp;in a river by weirs, bars, or any diminution of its former ſection. Our knowledge of the form which the&nbsp;ſurface of this ſwell affects, will furniſh rules for ſpacing&nbsp;theſe obſtructions in ſuch a manner, and at ſuch diſtances&nbsp;from each other, that the ſwell produced by one ſhall&nbsp;extend to the one above it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If we know the ſlope, the breadth, and the depth of a river, in the droughts of ſummer, and have determined on the height of the flood-gates, or keeps,&nbsp;which are to be ſet up in its bed, it is evident that&nbsp;their ſtations are not matters of arbitrary choice, if we&nbsp;would derive the greateſt poſſible advantage from&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some rivers in Flanders and Italy are made navigable in ſome ſort by ſimple ſluices, which, being ſhut, form magazines of water, which, being diſeharged by&nbsp;opening the gates, raiſes the inferior reach enough to&nbsp;permit the paſſage of the craft which are kept on it.&nbsp;After this momentary riſe the keeps are ſhut again,&nbsp;the water finks in the lower reach, and the lighters&nbsp;which were floated through the ſhallows are now obliged to draw into thoſe parts of the reach where they&nbsp;can lie afloat till the next ſupply of water from above&nbsp;enables them to proceed. This is a very rude and imperfect method, and unjuſtifiable at this day, when we&nbsp;know the effect of locks, or at leaſt of double gates.&nbsp;We do not mean to enter on the conſideration of theſe&nbsp;contrivances, and to give the methods of their conſtruction, in this place, but refer our readers to what has&nbsp;been already ſaid on this ſubject in the articles Canal,&nbsp;Lock, Navigation </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Inland),</span><span class="font0"> and to what will be&nbsp;ſaid in the article </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lVH<sup>c</sup>r ER-Works.</span><span class="font0"> At preſent we confine ourſelves to the Angle point of huſhanding the different falls in the bed of the river, in ſuch a manner&nbsp;that there may be everywhere a ſufficient depth of water : and, in what we have to deliver on the ſubject, we&nbsp;ſhall take the form of an example to illuſtrate the application of the foregoing rules.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Suppoſe then a river 40 feet wide and 3 feet deep in the droughts of ſummer, with a ſlope of 1 in 4800.&nbsp;T his, by the formula of uniform motion, will have a&nbsp;velocity V — 23⅜ inches per ſecond, and its diſeharge&nbsp;will be 405216 cubic inches, or 234⅛ feet. It is propoſed to give this river a depth not leſs than five feet&nbsp;in any place, by means of flood-gates of fix feet high&nbsp;and x8 feet wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We firſt compute the height at which this body of 2344 cubic feet of water will diſcharge itſelf over the&nbsp;flood-gates. This we ſhall find by Prob. II. to be 30i&nbsp;inches, to which adding 72, the height of the gate, we&nbsp;have IO2⅛ for the whole height of the water above the&nbsp;floor of the gate ; the primitive depth of the river being 3 feet, the riſe or ſwell 5 feet 6)- inches. In the&nbsp;next place, we find the range or ſenſible extent of this&nbsp;ſwell by Prob. I. and the obſervations which accompany it. This will be found tobe nearly 9177 fathoms.&nbsp;Now ſince the primitive depth of the river is three feet,&nbsp;there is only wanted two ſeet of addition ; and the&nbsp;queſtion is reduced to the finding what point of the&nbsp;curved ſurface of the ſwell is two feet above the tangent plane at the head of the ſwell ? or how far this&nbsp;point is from the gate ? The whole extent being 9177&nbsp;fathoms, and the deviations from the tangent plane being nearly in the duplicate ratio of the diſtances from&nbsp;the point of contact, we may inſtitute this proportion&nbsp;66⅜ : 24 = 9177<sup>,</sup> : 5526<sup>2</sup>. The laſt term is the diſtance (from the head of the ſwell) of that part of the&nbsp;ſurface which is two feet above the primitive ſurface of&nbsp;the river. Therefore 9177—5526, or 3651 fathoms,&nbsp;is the diſtance of this part from the flood-gate ; and&nbsp;this is the diſtance at which the gates ſhould be placed,&nbsp;from each other. No inconvenience would ariſe from&nbsp;having them nearer, if the banks be high enough to&nbsp;contain the waters ; but if they are farther diltant, the&nbsp;required depth of water cannot be had without increaſing the height of the gates ; but if reaſons of conve-niency ſhould induce us to place them nearer, the ſame&nbsp;depth may be ſecured by lower gates, and no additional height will be required for the banks. This is generally a matter of moment, becauſe the raifing the water brings along with it the chance of flooding the adjoining fields. Knowing the place where the ſwell ceaſes&nbsp;to be ſenſible, we can keep the top of the intermediate&nbsp;flood-gate at the precife height of the curved ſurface of&nbsp;the ſwell by means of the proportionality of the deviations from the tangent to the diſtances from the point&nbsp;of contact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But this rule will not do for a gate which is at a greater diſtance from the one above it than the 3651&nbsp;fathoms already mentioned. We know that a higher&nbsp;gate is required, producing a more extenſive ſwell ; and&nbsp;the one ſwell does not coincide with the other, although&nbsp;they may both begin from the ſame point A (ſig. 21.(&nbsp;Nor will the curves even be ſimilar, unleſs the thickneſs&nbsp;of the ſheet of water flowing over the gate be increaſed&nbsp;in the ſame ratio. But this is not the caſe ; becauſe&nbsp;the produce of the river, and therefore the thickneſs of&nbsp;the ſheet of water, is conſtant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But we may ſuppoſe them ſimilar without erring more than two or three decimals of an inch ; and then&nbsp;we ſhall have AF : AL =y^F : DL ; from which, if&nbsp;we take the thickneſs of the ſheet of water already calculated for the other gates, there will remain the height&nbsp;of the gate BL.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By following theſe methods, inſtead of proceeding by random gueſſes, we ſhall procure the greateſt depth of&nbsp;water at the ſmalleſt expence poſſible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But there is a circumſtance which muſt be attended to, and which, if neglected, may in a ſhort time render&nbsp;all our works uſeleſs. Theſe gates muſt frequently be&nbsp;open in the time of freſhes ; and as this channel then&nbsp;has its natural Hope increaſed in every reach by the&nbsp;great contraction of the ſection in the gates, and alſo&nbsp;rolls along a greater body of water, the action of the&nbsp;ſtream on its bed muſt be increaſed by the augmentation of velocity which theſe circumſtances will produce:</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
