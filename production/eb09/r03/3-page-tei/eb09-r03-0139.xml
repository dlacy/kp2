After one pair of names is inscribed PEREG, showing that they belonged to the foreign corps called Peregriui, probably stationed here as guards to the imperial residences on the hill above. Most of these inscriptions appear to be as early as the 1st century a. D.@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi> These interesting graffiti have in great part perished during the last few years, and soon none will remain.</p><p>. The great stadium of the Palatine (see 50 in fig. 17) was begun by Domitian, mainly built by Hadrian, and much altered or restored by Severus. The greater part of the outer walls and the large exedra or apse at the side, with upper floor for the emperor’s seat, are of the time of Hadiian, as is shown by the brick stamps, and the character of the brick facing, which much resembles that of the Flavian time (bricks 1⅜ inches and joints ⅜ inch thick).@@<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The stadium is surrounded with a colonnade of engaged shafts, forming a sort of aisle with gallery over it. Except those at the curved end, which are of Hadrian’s time, these piers are of the time of Severus, as are also all the flat piers along the outer wall,—one opposite each of those in the inner line. This shows either that the stadium must have been left by Hadrian in an unfinished state, or else that it Siiftered seriously from a fire or earthquake before the reign of Severus.</p><p>&gt; In addition to the stadium, Hadrian built a number of very handsome rooms, forming a palace on the south-east side and at the south-west end of the stadium. These rooms were partly destroyed and partly hidden by the later palace of Severus, the foundations of which in many places cut through and render useless the highly decorated rooms of Hadrian (53 in fig. 17). The finest of these which is now visible is a room with a large window opening into the stadium near the south angle ; it lias intersecting barrel vaults, with deep coffers, richly ornamented in stucco. The oval structure shown in the plan (50 in fig. 17), with other still later additions, belongs to the 4th or 5th century, when the stadium was no longer used for races ; some of the walls, of opus mixtum, which cut up and disfigure this noble building appear to be the work of Theodoric, <hi rend="italic">c.</hi>  500.</p><p>The palace of Septiniius Severus was very extensive and of enormous height ; it extends not only all over the south angle of the Palatine but also a long way into the valley of the Circus Maximus and towards the Cœlian. This part (like Caligula’s palace) is carried on very lofty arched substructures, so as to form a level, uniform with the top of the hill, on which the grand apartments stood. The whole height from the base of the Palatine to several stories above its summit must have been enormous. Little now remains of the highest stories, except part of a grand staircase which led to them. Extensive baths, all richly decorated with marble linings and mosaics in glass and marble, cover a great part of the top of the hill. These and other parts of the Palatine were supplied with water by an aqueduct built by Nero in continuation of the Claudian aqueduct, some arches of which still exist on the slope of the Palatine (56 in fig. 17 ; see Spart., <hi rend="italic">Sept. Sev.,</hi>  24). The palace of Severus was restored and enlarged by Heliogabalus and Sevems Alexander.@@<hi rend="sup">3</hi>  One of the main roads up to the Palatine passes under the arched substructures of Severus, and near this, at the foot of the hill, at the south angle, Septimius Severus built an outlying part of his palace, a building of great splendour dedicated to the Sun and Moon, called the Septizonium, probably from its seven stories or zonæ (see Jordan,<hi rend="italic">Bull. Inst.,</hi>  1872, p. 145). It has been doubted whether it can really have been as much as seven stories high ; but this is not improbable when we consider the enormous height of the rest of Severus’s palace, reaching from the foot of the Palatine to far above its summit. Part of the Septi-zonium existed as late as the reign of Sixtus V. (1585-90), who destroyed it in order to use its marble decorations and columns in the new basilica of St Peter ; drawings of it are given by Du Perac, <hi rend="italic">Vestigj di Roma,</hi>  1575, and in other works of that century.@@<hi rend="sup">4</hi></p><p>The Velia and Germalns were two outlying spurs of the Palatine.@@<hi rend="sup">5 </hi>Owing to the great alterations that have been made in the contour of the hill it is now very difficult to identify these ancient districts (see<hi rend="italic">Aim. Inst.,</hi>  1865, p. 347). The Germalus or Cermalus was probably on the side towards the Velabrum, while the Velia may be identified with that elevated ground between the Palatine and the Esquiline on which the temple of Venus and Rome and the arch of Titus now stand. It is evident that this was once much loftier and more abrupt than it is now ; a great part of it was cut away when the level platform for the temple of Venus and Rome</p><p>was formed. The foundations of part of Nero’s palace aloug the road between this temple and the Esquiline are exposed for about 20 to 30 feet in height, showing a corresponding lowering of the level here, and the bare tufa rock, cut to a flat surface, is visible on the site of Hadrian’s great temple ; that the Velia was once much loftier is also indicated by the story of the removal of Valerius Publicola’s dwelling.@@<hi rend="sup">6</hi></p><p>On the Velia and the adjoining Summa Sacra Via were twe temples which Augustus rebuilt.@@<hi rend="sup">7</hi> The “ Ædes Larum ” is probably the “ Sacellum Larum ” mentioned by Tacitus<hi rend="italic">(Aim.,</hi>  xii. 24) as one of the points in the line of the pomœrium of Roma Quadrata. The Sacra Via started at the Sacellum Streniae, an unknown point on the Esquiline, probably near the baths of Titus (Varro, A.A.<hi rend="sub">l </hi>v. 47), in the quarter called Cerolia. Thence it probably (in Iatei times) Jiassed round part of the Colosseum to the slope leading uj to the arch of Titus on the Velia ; this piece of its course is lined on one side by extensive baths, attributed to Heliogabalus (45 in fig. 17), and farther back, against the cliff of the Palatine, arc remains of Nero’s enormous palace (see 42 in fig. 17). From the arch of Titus or Summa Sacra Via the original line of the road has been altered (see Plate Λ'II.) ; the angle at which the scanty remains of the Regia are set probably shows the early direction of the Sacra A ia in passing on to the temple of Vesta. Its later course was more to the north-east, passing at a sharp angle from the arch oi Titus to the front of Constantine’s basilica, and on past the temple of Faustina. It is uncertain whether the continuation of this road to the arch of Severus was in later times called the Sacra Via oi whether it rejoined its old line along the Basilica Julia by the cross-road in front of the Ædes Jiilii. Its original line past the temple of Vesta was completely built over in the 3d and 4th centuries, anti clumsily-fitted pavements of marble and travertine occupy the place of the old basalt blocks.@@<hi rend="sup">8</hi>  The course of the Nova Via@@<hi rend="sup">9</hi>  (see figs; 16 and 17) along the palace of Caligula@@<hi rend="sup">10</hi>  was exposetl in 1882-84. According to Varro (A.A., vi. 59) it was a very old road. It led up from the Velabrum, probably winding along the slope of the Palatine, round the north angle under the church of S. Maria Libératrice. The rest of its course, gently ascending towards the arch of Titus, is now exposed, as are also the stairs, possibly the Seake Anulariæ, which connected it with the Clivus A ictoriæ at the Porta Romanula ; a continuation of these stairs, still unexcavated, Ieel down to the Forum.@@<hi rend="sup">11</hi></p><p>The extent of the once marshy. Velabrum (Gk., <hi rend="italic">Fl</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">os)</hi>  is not known, though part of its site is indicated by the church of S. Giorgio in Velabro; Varro (Z.A., vi. 24) says, “extra ιιrbeιn an-tiquam fuit, non longe a porta Romanula. ” It was a district full of shops (Plaut., <hi rend="italic">Capk,</hi>  iii. 1, 29; Hor., <hi rend="italic">Sak,</hi>  ii. 3, 229). The A icus Tuscus on its course from the Forum to the Circus skirted the A<hi rend="sup">r</hi>elabrum (Dionys., v. 26), from which the goldsmiths’ arch was an entrance into the Forum Boarium (comp. Dionys., i. 40).</p><p><hi rend="italic">Cnpitoline Hill.</hi></p><p>The Capitoline Hill, once called Mons Satumius (Varro, <hi rend="italic">L.

The older name of the Capi-tolium was Mons Tarpeius (Varro,<hi rend="italic">L. L.,</hi>  v. 41). Livy (i. 10) mentions the founding of a shrine to Jupiter Feretrius on the Capitolium by Romulus ;@@<hi rend="sup">13</hi>  this summit was afterwards occupied by the great triple temple dedicated to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, a triad of deities worshipped under the names of Tinia, Thalna, and Menrva in every Etruscau city. This great temple was (Liv., i. 38, 53) founded by Tarquin L, built by his son Tarquin IL, and dedicated by M. Horatius Pulvillus, consul suffectus in 509B.C.@@<hi rend="sup">14 </hi>It was built in the Etruscan style, of peperino stuccoed and painted (A<hi rend="sup">τ</hi>itr., iii. 3), with wooden architraves, wide Intercoluniniations, and painted terra-cotta statues.@@<hi rend="sup">15</hi>  It was rebuilt many times ; the original temple lasted till it was burnt in 83 b.c. ; it was then refounded in marble' by Sulla, with Corinthian columns stolen from the temple of Olympian Zeus in Athens (Plin., xxxvi. 5), and was completed and dedicated by Q. Lut. Catulus, whose name appeared on the front. Augustus, in spite of his having carried out part of the work, did not introduce his name by the side of that of Catulus. It was again burnt by the ATtellian rioters in 70 a.d., and rebuilt by A’espasian in 71.@@<hi rend="sup">16</hi>  Lastly, it was burnt in the three days’ fire</p><p>@@@<hi rend="sup">1 </hi>See Henzen, in the<hi rend="italic">Bull.
