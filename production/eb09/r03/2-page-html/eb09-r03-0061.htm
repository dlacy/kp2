        <p><span class="font2">faithful Massiliots sent word that Hasdrubal, beaten in Spain, was
                marching to join Hannibal, in Italy. The&nbsp;anxiety at Rome was intense, and every
                nerve was strained&nbsp;to prevent the junction of the two brothers. Equally
                great&nbsp;was the relief when the news arrived that the bold march&nbsp;of the
                consul Claudius had succeeded, and that Hasdrubal&nbsp;had been defeated and slain
                on the river Metaurus (207).&nbsp;The war in Italy was now virtually ended, for,
                though&nbsp;during four years more Hannibal stood at bay in a corner&nbsp;of
                Bruttium, he was powerless to prevent the restoration&nbsp;of Roman authority
                throughout the peninsula. Sicily&nbsp;was once more secure ; and finally in 206, the
                year after&nbsp;the victory on the Metaurus, the successes of the young
                P.&nbsp;Scipio in Spain (211-206) were crowned by the complete&nbsp;expulsion of the
                Carthaginians from the peninsula.&nbsp;Nothing now remained to Carthage outside
                Africa but the&nbsp;ground on which Hannibal desperately held out, and&nbsp;popular
                opinion at Rome warmly supported Scipio when&nbsp;on his return from Spain he
                eagerly urged an immediate&nbsp;invasion of Africa. The senate hesitated. Many
                were&nbsp;jealous of Scipio’s fame, and resented his scarcely
                concealed&nbsp;intention of appealing to the people, should the senate&nbsp;decline
                his proposals. Others, like the veteran Q. Fabius,&nbsp;thought the attempt
                hazardous, with exhausted resources,&nbsp;and while Hannibal was still on Italian
                soil. But Scipio&nbsp;gained the day. He was elected consul for 205, and
                given&nbsp;the province of Sicily, with permission to cross into Africa&nbsp;if he
                thought fit. Voluntary contributions of men, money,&nbsp;and supplies poured in to
                the support of the popular hero ;&nbsp;and by the end of 205 Scipio had collected in
                Sicily a&nbsp;sufficient force for his purpose. In 201 he crossed to&nbsp;Africa,
                where he was welcomed by the Numidian prince&nbsp;Masinissa, whose friendship he had
                made in Spain. In&nbsp;203 he twice defeated the Carthaginian forces, and a
                large&nbsp;party at Carthage were anxious to accept his offer of&nbsp;negotiations.
                But the advocates of resistance triumphed.&nbsp;Hannibal was recalled from Italy,
                and with him his brother&nbsp;Mago, who had made a last desperate attempt to
                create&nbsp;a diversion in Italy by landing in Liguria. Mago died&nbsp;on the
                voyage, but Hannibal returned to fight his last&nbsp;battle against Rome at Zama,
                where Scipio, who had been&nbsp;continued in command as proconsul for 202 by a
                special&nbsp;vote of the people, won a complete victory. The war&nbsp;was over. The
                Roman assembly gladly voted that the&nbsp;Carthaginian request for peace should be
                granted, and&nbsp;entrusted the settlement of the terms to its favourite
                Scipio&nbsp;and a commission of ten senators. Carthage was allowed&nbsp;to retain
                her own territory in Africa intact ; but she undertook to wage no wars outside
                Africa, and none inside&nbsp;without the consent of Rome. She surrendered all
                her&nbsp;ships but ten triremes, her elephants, and all prisoners of&nbsp;war.
                Finally she agreed to pay an indemnity of 10,000&nbsp;talents in fifty years.
                Masinissa was rewarded by an&nbsp;increase of territory, and was enrolled among the
                “ allies&nbsp;and friends ” of the Roman people.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The battle of Zama decided the fate of the West. The power of
                Carthage was broken, and her supremacy passed&nbsp;by the right of conquest to Rome.
                Henceforth Rome had&nbsp;no rival to fear westward of Italy, and it rested with
                herself to settle within what limits her supremacy should be&nbsp;confined, and what
                form it should take. The answer to&nbsp;both these questions was largely determined
                for her by&nbsp;circumstances. For the next fifty years Rome was too&nbsp;deeply
                involved in the affairs of the East to think of&nbsp;extending her rule far beyond
                the limits of the rich inheritance which had fallen to her by the defeat of Carthage
                ;&nbsp;and it was not until 125 that she commenced a fresh&nbsp;career of conquest
                in the West by invading Transalpine&nbsp;Gaul. But within this area considerable
                advance was</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">made in the organization and consolidation of her rule. The rate of
                progress was indeed unequal. In the case of&nbsp;Sicily and Spain, the immediate
                establishment of a Roman&nbsp;government was imperatively necessary, if these
                possessions were not either to fall a prey to internal anarchy, or&nbsp;be recovered
                for Carthage by some second Hamilcar.&nbsp;Accordingly, we find that in Sicily the
                former dominions&nbsp;of Hiero were at once united with the western half of
                the&nbsp;island as a single province, under the rule of a Roman&nbsp;prætor
                    (201),@@<sup>2</sup> and that in Spain, after nine years of a&nbsp;provisional
                government (206-197), two provinces were in&nbsp;197@@<sup>3</sup> definitely
                established, and each, like Sicily, assigned&nbsp;to one of the prætors for the
                year, two additional prætors&nbsp;being elected for the purpose. But here the
                resemblance&nbsp;between the two cases ends. From 201 down to the outbreak of the
                Slave War in 136 there was unbroken peace&nbsp;in Sicily, and its part in the
                history is limited to its&nbsp;important functions in supplying Rome with corn and
                in&nbsp;provisioning and clothing the Roman legions.@@<sup>4</sup> It
                became&nbsp;every year a more integral part of Italy ; and a large proportion even
                of the land itself passed gradually into the&nbsp;hands of enterprising Roman
                speculators. The governors&nbsp;of the two Spains had very different work to do from
                that&nbsp;which fell to the lot of the Sicilian prætors. Although&nbsp;the coast
                towns readily acquiesced in Roman rule, the&nbsp;restless and warlike tribes of the
                interior were in a constant state of ferment, which from time to time broke&nbsp;out
                into open revolt. In Sicily the ordinary prætorian&nbsp;authority, with at most a
                few cohorts, was sufficient, but&nbsp;the condition of Spain required that year
                after year the&nbsp;prætors should be armed with the consular authority,
                and&nbsp;backed by a standing force of four legions, while more&nbsp;than once the
                presence of the consuls themselves was&nbsp;found necessary. Still, in spite of all
                difficulties, the&nbsp;work of pacification proceeded. To the elder Cato
                (consul&nbsp;195), and to Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus (prætor and&nbsp;proprætor
                180-179), father of the two tribunes, is mainly&nbsp;due the credit of quieting the
                Celtiberian tribes of central&nbsp;Spain, and the government of Gracchus was
                followed by&nbsp;thirty years of comparative tranquillity. The
                insurrection&nbsp;headed by Viriathus in 149 was largely caused by
                the&nbsp;exactions of the Roman magistrates themselves, while its&nbsp;obstinate
                continuance down to the capture of Numantia&nbsp;in 133, was almost as much the
                result of the incapacity of&nbsp;the Roman commanders. But the re-settlement of
                the&nbsp;country by Scipio Africanus the younger in that year left&nbsp;all Spain,
                with the exception of the highland Astures and&nbsp;Cantabri in the north-west,
                finally and tranquilly subject&nbsp;to Rome. Meanwhile the disturbed state of the
                interior&nbsp;had not prevented the spread of Roman civilization on&nbsp;the
                seaboard. Roman traders and speculators flocked&nbsp;to the seaport towns and spread
                inland. The mines&nbsp;became centres of Roman industry ; the Roman
                legionaries&nbsp;quartered in Spain year after year married Spanish wives,&nbsp;and
                when their service was over gladly settled down in&nbsp;Spain, in preference to
                returning to Italy. The first Roman&nbsp;communities established outside Italy were
                both planted&nbsp;in Spain, and both owed their existence to the
                    Roman&nbsp;legions.@@<sup>5</sup> Spain even in 133 gave promise of becoming
                in&nbsp;time “ more Roman than Rome itself.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">In Africa there was no question at first of the introduction of Roman
                government by the formation of a province. Carthage, bound hand and foot by the
                treaty of 201, was&nbsp;placed under the jealous watch of the loyal prince of
                Nu-</span></p>
