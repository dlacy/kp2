<p><span class="font1">he became personally known to the governor-general, led to his being appointed, at his own desire, as political agent in Turkish&nbsp;Arabia; thus he was enabled to settle in Bagdad, where he&nbsp;devoted much time to the cuneiform studies which attracted&nbsp;him. He was now able, under considerable difficulties and&nbsp;with no small personal risk, to make a complete transcript of the&nbsp;Behistun inscription, which he was also successful in deciphering&nbsp;and interpreting. Having collected a large amount of invaluable&nbsp;information on this and kindred topics, in addition to much&nbsp;geographical knowledge gained in the prosecution of various&nbsp;explorations (including visits with Layard to the ruins of&nbsp;Nineveh), he returned to England on leave of absence in 1849.&nbsp;He remained at home for two years, published in 1851 his&nbsp;memoir on the Behistun inscription, and was promoted to the&nbsp;rank of lieutenant-colonel. He disposed of his valuable collection of Babydonian, Sabaean, and Sassanian antiquities to the&nbsp;trustees of the British Museum, who also made him a considerable grant to enable him to carry on the Assyrian and Babylonian&nbsp;excavations initiated by Layard. In 1851 he returned to&nbsp;Bagdad. The excavations were carried on under his direction&nbsp;with valuable results, among the most important being the&nbsp;discovery of material that greatly contributed to the final&nbsp;decipherment and interpretation of the cuneiform character.&nbsp;An accident with which he met in 1855 hastened his determination to return to England, and in that year he resigned his&nbsp;post in the East India Company. On his return to England the&nbsp;distinction of K.C.B. was conferred upon him, and he was&nbsp;appointed a crown director of the East India Company. The&nbsp;remaining forty years of his life were full of activity—political,&nbsp;diplomatic, and scientific—and were mainly spent in London.&nbsp;In 1858 he was appointed a member of the first India Council,&nbsp;but resigned in 1859 on being sent to Persia as envoy extra-ordinary and minister plenipotentiary. The latter post he held&nbsp;only for a year, owing to his dissatisfaction with circumstances&nbsp;connected with his official position there. Previously he&nbsp;had sat in Parliament as M.P. for Reigate from February to&nbsp;September 1858; he sat again as M.P. for Frome, 1865-68. He&nbsp;was appointed to the Council of India again in 1868, and continued to serve upon it until his death. He was a strong&nbsp;advocate of the forward policy in Afghanistan, and counselled&nbsp;the retention of Kandahar. His views were more particularly&nbsp;expressed in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">England and Russia in the East,</span><span class="font1"> 1875. He was a&nbsp;trustee of the British Museum from 1876 till his death. He was&nbsp;created G.C.B. in 1889, and a Baronet in 1891; was president&nbsp;of the Geographical Society from 1874 to 1875, and of the&nbsp;Asiatic Society from 1878 to 1881; and received honorary&nbsp;degrees at Oxford, Cambridge, and Edinburgh. He married,&nbsp;in September 1862, Louisa Caroline Harcourt Seymour, who&nbsp;bore him two sons and died in 1889. He died in London on&nbsp;the 5th of March 1895. His published works include (apart&nbsp;from minor contributions to the publications of learned societies)&nbsp;four volumes of cuneiform inscriptions, published under his&nbsp;direction between 1870 and 1884 by the trustees of the British&nbsp;Museum; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Persian Cuneiform Inscription at Behistun,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">1846-51, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Outline of the History of Assyria,</span><span class="font1"> 1852, both reprinted from the Asiatic Society’s journals; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Commentary&nbsp;on the Cuneiform Inscriptions of Babylon and Assyria,</span><span class="font1"> 1850;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Notes on the Early History of Babylonia,</span><span class="font1"> 1854; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">England and&nbsp;Russia in the East,</span><span class="font1"> 1875.

<p><span class="font0">See G. Rawlinson, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Memoir of Henry Creswicke Rowlinson</span><span class="font0"> (1898). </span><span class="font1">RAWLINSON, RICHARD (1690-1755), English antiquary and divine, was a younger son of Sir Thomas Rawlinson (1647-1708), lord mayor of London in 1705-6, and a brother of Thomas&nbsp;Rawlinson (1681-1725), the bibliophile. Born on the 3rd of&nbsp;January 1690, he was educated at St Paul’s school, at Eton,&nbsp;and at St John’s College, Oxford. In 1716 he was ordained,&nbsp;but as he was a nonjuror and a Jacobite the ceremony was performed by a nonjuring bishop, Jeremy Collier. Rawlinson then&nbsp;travelled in England and on the continent of Europe, where he&nbsp;passed several years, making collections of manuscripts, coins&nbsp;and curiosities. In 1728 he became a bishop among the nonjurors, but he hardly ever appears to have discharged episcopal&nbsp;functions, preferring to pass his time in collecting books and&nbsp;manuscripts, pictures and curiosities. He died at Islington&nbsp;on the 6th of April 1755. Rawlinson left his manuscripts, his&nbsp;curiosities, and some other property to the Bodleian Library;&nbsp;he endowed a professorship of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, and was&nbsp;a benefactor to St John’s College. </span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAWLINSON, SIR ROBERT (1810-1898), English engineer and sanitarian, was bom at Bristol on the 28th of February&nbsp;1810. His father was a mason and builder at Chorley, Lancashire, and he himself began his engineering education by working&nbsp;in a stonemason’s yard. In 1831 he obtained employment&nbsp;under Jesse Hartley in the engineer’s office at the Liverpool&nbsp;docks, and for four years from 1836 he was engaged under&nbsp;Robert Stephenson as assistant resident engineer for the Blisworth section of what is now the London &amp; North-Western&nbsp;main line from London to the North. Returning to Liverpool,&nbsp;he spent some years as assistant-surveyor to the corporation,&nbsp;and then in 1844 accepted an engineering post on the Bridgewater&nbsp;Canal. Three years later he returned to Liverpool, to superintend the design and construction of the famous brick-arched&nbsp;ceiling in the St George’s Hall, in succession to his friend&nbsp;H. L. Elmes. During this period Rawlinson’s reputation as a&nbsp;sanitarian had been growing, and when the Public Health Act&nbsp;was passed in 1848 he was appointed one of the first inspectors&nbsp;under it. He inspected many of the chief towns of England,&nbsp;and his reports on the sanitary conditions he found brought&nbsp;him in many cases into great unpopularity with the municipal&nbsp;rulers. Early in 1855 popular feeŪng was so aroused by the&nbsp;waste of life that was going on among the British troops in the&nbsp;Crimea through disease, and by the mismanagement of the&nbsp;campaign, that the Aberdeen ministry was forced to resign.&nbsp;Lord Palmerston, who then became prime minister, sent a&nbsp;sanitary commission, consisting of Rawlinson and two medical&nbsp;members (Dr John Sutherland and Dr H. Gavin), with full&nbsp;powers from the War Office, to do whatever it thought would&nbsp;lead to better hygienic conditions in camp and hospital. The&nbsp;commission reached Constantinople in March, and, by insisting&nbsp;on what now seem the most obvious precautions, succeeded&nbsp;within a few weeks in reducing the death-rate in the Levantine&nbsp;hospitals from 42 to 2¼%. Passing on to the Crimea, it&nbsp;effected a similar improvement there, and by the end of the year&nbsp;the health of the whole British army in the field was even better&nbsp;than it enjoyed at home. Rawlinson’s next great public service,&nbsp;for which he was made C.B. in 1865, was in connexion with the&nbsp;distress caused in Lancashire by the collapse of the cotton-manufacturing industry consequent on the American Civil War.&nbsp;In 1863 it was suggested that, in order to provide employment&nbsp;for the starving operatives, the government should start works&nbsp;of “ utility, profit and ornament,” and Rawlinson being sent&nbsp;to make an official investigation into the question, reported,&nbsp;after visiting nearly 100 towns, that 1½ million sterling might&nbsp;be advantageously expended in providing water-supply and&nbsp;drainage, forming streets, &amp;c., in those places. The result was&nbsp;that the Treasury was authorized to advance £1,200,000 the&nbsp;amount was afterwards increased) at 3½% for carrying out&nbsp;such works, which proved of enormous public benefit. In&nbsp;1866 he acted as chairman of the Royal Commission on the&nbsp;Pollution of Rivers, and a few years later was appointed&nbsp;chief engineering inspector to the Local Government Board;&nbsp;on retiring from this position in 1888 he was promoted to&nbsp;be K.C.B. In 1894 he served as president of the Institution&nbsp;of Civil Engineers. He died in London on the 31st of May&nbsp;1898.</span></p>
