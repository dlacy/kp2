a ſtrong town of Germany, in Sileſia, and capital of a province of the ſame name, with a caſtle. It is the handſomeſt town of Sileſia, next to Breſlaw. The ſtreets are large, the church fine, and the houſes well built. The fortifications are not very conſiderable, and the royal palace is turned into a convent. All the magiſtrates are Roman Catholics; but moſt of the inhabitants are Proteſtants, who have a church without the town, as alſo a public ſchool and bells. It is ſeated on an eminence on the river Weiſtritz, 27 miles ſouth-eaſt of Lignitz, and 22 ſouth- weſt of Breſlaw. E. Long. 16. 48. N. Lat. 50. 46.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
