<p><span class="font1">He died on January 11,1762, and was buried in the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields. Roubiliac was very largely&nbsp;employed for portrait statues and busts, and especially for&nbsp;sepulchral monuments in Westminster Abbey and elsewhere. His chief works in the abbey are the monuments&nbsp;of Handel, Admiral Warren, Marshal Wade, Mrs Nightingale, and the duke of Argyll, the last of these being the&nbsp;first work which established Roubiliac’s fame as a sculptor.&nbsp;The statues of George I., Sir Isaac Newton, and the duke&nbsp;of Somerset at Cambridge, and of George II. in Golden&nbsp;Square, London, were also his work, as well as many other&nbsp;important pieces of portrait sculpture. Trinity College,&nbsp;Cambridge, possesses a series of busts of distinguished&nbsp;members of the college by him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Roubiliac possessed much skill in portraiture, and was technically a real master of his art, but unhappily he lived&nbsp;at a time when it had reached a very low ebb. His&nbsp;figures are uneasy, devoid of dignity and sculpturesque&nbsp;breadth, and his draperies are treated in a manner more&nbsp;suited to painting than sculpture. His excessive striving&nbsp;after dramatic effect takes away from that repose of attitude which is so necessary for a portrait in marble. His&nbsp;most celebrated work, the Nightingale monument, in the&nbsp;north transept of Westminster Abbey, a marvel of&nbsp;technical skill, is only saved from being ludicrous by its&nbsp;ghastly hideousness. On this the dying wife is represented&nbsp;as sinking in the arms of her husband, who in vain strives&nbsp;to ward off a dart which Death is aiming at her. The&nbsp;lower part of the monument, on which the two portrait&nbsp;figures stand, is shaped like a tomb, out of the opening&nbsp;door of which Death, as a half-veiled skeleton, is bursting&nbsp;forth. Wonderful patience and anatomical realism [are&nbsp;lavished on the marble bones of this hideous figure, and&nbsp;the whole of the grim conception is carried out with much&nbsp;skill, but in the worst possible taste. The statue of&nbsp;Handel in the south transept is well modelled, but the&nbsp;attitude is affected and the face void of any real expression. It is a striking proof of the degraded taste of the age&nbsp;that these painful works when first set up were enthusiastically admired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROUCHER, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jean Antoine</span><span class="font1"> (1745-1794), a French poet, to whom a melancholy fate and some descriptive&nbsp;verse equal to anything written during at least three-quarters of a century by any of his countrymen except&nbsp;André Chénier, gave some reputation, was born on&nbsp;February 17, 1745 at Montpellier, and perished by the&nbsp;guillotine at Paris on July 25, 1794. He wrote an&nbsp;epithalamium on Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette, gained&nbsp;the favour of Turgot, and obtained a salt-tax collector-ship. His main poem was entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les Mois</span><span class="font1"> ; it appeared&nbsp;in 1779, was praised in MS., damned in print, and restored&nbsp;to a just appreciation by the students of literature of the&nbsp;present century. It has the drawbacks of merely didactic-descriptive poetry on the great scale, but much grace&nbsp;and spirit in parts. Roucher was by no means antirevolutionary, but ill-luck and perhaps his unpopular employment made him a victim of the Revolution. He lay&nbsp;in prison for nearly a year before his death, and went to&nbsp;it on the same tumbril with Chénier. The malicious wit&nbsp;of RivaroVs </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mot</span><span class="font1"> on the ill-success of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les Mois,</span><span class="font1"> “ C’est le&nbsp;plus beau naufrage du siècle,” is not intelligible unless it&nbsp;is said that one of the most elaborate passages describes a&nbsp;shipwreck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROUEN, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> city of France, the ancient capital of Normandy, and now the administrative centre of the&nbsp;department of Seine Inférieure, the seat of an archbishopric and a court of appeal, and the headquarters of&nbsp;the third corps d’armée, stands on a level site on the&nbsp;right bank of the Seine in 49° 26' N. lat. and 1° 6' E.&nbsp;long, at the point where it is joined by the Aubette and&nbsp;the small Rivière de Robec ; it has also crept some distance up the hills which enclose the valley on the right,&nbsp;and has an extension on the plain on the left bank. The&nbsp;faubourgs by which it is surrounded are, reckoning from&nbsp;the east, Martainville (on the left bank of the Robec), St&nbsp;Hilaire, Beauvoisine, Bouvreuil, and Cauchoise; and the&nbsp;portion which lies on the left bank of the Seine is known&nbsp;as the Faubourg St Sever. Between the old town and&nbsp;the faubourgs runs a line of boulevards. Communication&nbsp;between the two banks of the river is maintained by ferryboats and by two bridges ; the upper bridge, a stone structure, is divided into two parts by the Lacroix island and&nbsp;decorated by a statue of Corneille ; the lower is an iron&nbsp;suspension bridge which opens in the middle to let masted&nbsp;vessels pass. The railway from Havre to Paris crosses&nbsp;the Seine a little above Rouen, and having passed by a&nbsp;tunnel under the higher quarters of the city reaches a&nbsp;station on the north at a distance of 87 miles from Paris&nbsp;and 55 from Havre. Another station at Martainville is the&nbsp;terminus of the line from Rouen to Amiens ; and at St&nbsp;Sever are those of the lines to Paris and to Orleans by&nbsp;Elbeuf. Since about 1860 wide streets have been driven&nbsp;through the old town, and tramway lines now traverse the&nbsp;whole city and its environs. Rouen, which is 78 miles&nbsp;from the sea, stands fourth in the list of French ports,&nbsp;coming next to Marseilles, Havre, and Bordeaux. Embankments constructed along the lower Seine have forced&nbsp;the river to deepen its own channel, and the land thus&nbsp;reclaimed has more than repaid the expenses incurred. The&nbsp;port is now accessible to vessels drawing 21 feet of water,&nbsp;and by means of easy dredgings this will be increased to from&nbsp;25 feet to 28 according to the tide. The expansion of the&nbsp;traffic as the improvements have advanced is shown by the&nbsp;following returns : whereas in 1856 the number of vessels&nbsp;entered and cleared was 6220, with an aggregate burden&nbsp;of 570,314 tons, the corresponding figures were 4511 and&nbsp;748,076 in 1876, and 5189 and 1,438,055 in 1880. What&nbsp;is now wanted is an increased amount of quay accommodation, the old line of quays scarcely exceeding 1 mile&nbsp;in length. The building of new quays and repairing-docks&nbsp;for large vessels is in active progress ; the port is being&nbsp;dredged and deepened; and schemes are under consideration for a slip, a petroleum dock, and corn elevators.@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>Rouen has regular steamboat communication with Bordeaux, Spain, Algeria, London, Hull, Goole, Plymouth,&nbsp;Bristol, and Canada. A sunken chain allows boats to be&nbsp;towed up to Paris and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The population of the six cantons of Rouen in 1881 was 105,906, but if the suburbs are included the figure&nbsp;may be stated at about 150,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The imports landed at Rouen include cottons, wheat, maize, and petroleum from America ; coal and iron from&nbsp;England; marble, oils, wines, and dried fruits from Italy;&nbsp;wiues, wools, ores, and metals from Spain ; grain and&nbsp;wool from the Black Sea ; grapes from the Levant ; rice&nbsp;from India; coffee from the French colonies; oil seeds,&nbsp;timber, dyewoods, foreign textile fabrics, Dutch cheese,&nbsp;Ac. The articles of export comprise grain, table fruits,&nbsp;oil-seeds and oilcake, sugar, olive oil, palm oil, timber,&nbsp;hemp, linen, and wool, marble, granite, hewn stone,&nbsp;plaster and building materials, sulphur, coal, pig-iron,&nbsp;steel, copper, lead, zinc, salt, dyestuffs and other chemical&nbsp;products, wines, brandy, ciders, earthenware and glassware, machinery, packing-paper, Ac.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Cotton spinning and weaving are carried on in the town, and especially the manufacture of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rouennenes</span><span class="font0"> (cotton fabrics woven with&nbsp;dyed yarn). In this connexion the department of Seine Inférieure&nbsp;gives employment to 200,000 workmen, most of them in Rouen and</span></p>
