<p><span class="font0">laric continued ſtill extremely formidable ; and Stilicho choſe rather to conclude a treaty with him, and allow&nbsp;him an annual penſion, than to continue the war with&nbsp;vigour. Alaric, who was not very ſcrupulous in his&nbsp;obſervance of this treaty, in his retreat attempted to&nbsp;make himſelf maſter of the city of Verona : but Stilicho coming up with him near that place, gave him a&nbsp;terrible defeat, in which the loſs was little leſs than it&nbsp;had been at Pollentia ; after which he effected a retreat&nbsp;out of Italy, but not without the greateſt difficulty and&nbsp;danger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Italy being thus happily delivered, Honorius entered Rome in triumph, having Stilicho along with him in the triumphal chariot., On his entry into the city, he&nbsp;aboliſhed the ſhows of gladiators ; which, though forbidden by Conſtantine, had been tolerated by his ſucceſſors, and even by Ttieodoſius himſelf, out of complaiſance to the people, who were beyond meaſure fond&nbsp;of that inhuman diverſion. However, ſoon after, the&nbsp;emperor was obliged to leave the metropolis and retire&nbsp;to Ravenna, in order to ſecure himſelf from the barbarians, who now broke in upon the empire on all ſides.&nbsp;Such multitudes now made their appearance, that it is&nbsp;not a little difficult to account for their ſudden emigration. Mr Gibbon accounts for it from a ſuppoſed&nbsp;revolution in the north-eaſtem parts of China. “ The&nbsp;Chineſe annals (ſays he), as they have been interpreted by the learned induſtry of the preſent age, may&nbsp;be uſefully applied to reveal the ſecret and remote&nbsp;cauſes of the fall of the Roman empire. The extenſive&nbsp;territory to the north of the great wall was poſſeſſed,&nbsp;after the flight of the Huns, by the victorious Sienpi ;&nbsp;who were ſometimes broken into independent tribes,&nbsp;and ſometimes re-united under a ſupreme chief ; till at&nbsp;length ſtyling themſelves </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Topa,</span><span class="font0"> or “ maſters of the&nbsp;earth,” they acquired a more ſolid conſiſtence, and a&nbsp;more formidable power. The Topa ſoon compelled&nbsp;the paſtoral nations of the eaſtern deſert to acknowledge the ſuperiority of their arms ; they invaded China&nbsp;in a period of weakneſs and inteſtine diſcord ; and&nbsp;theſe fortunate Tartars, adopting the laws and manners of the vanquiſhed people, founded an imperial dy-naſty, which reigned near 160 years over the northern&nbsp;provinces of the monarchy. Some generations before&nbsp;they aſcended the throne of China, one of the Topa&nbsp;princes had enlifted in his cavalry a ſlave of the name&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Moko,</span><span class="font0"> renowned for his valour ; but who was tempted, by the ſear of puniſhment, to deſert his ſtandard,&nbsp;and to range the deſert at the head of ιoo followers.&nbsp;This gang of robbers and outlaws ſwelled into </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">camp,&nbsp;a tribe, a numerous people, diſtinguiſhed by the appellation of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Geougerι ;</span><span class="font0"> and their hereditary chieftains,&nbsp;the poſterity of Mokυ the ſlave, aſſumed their rank&nbsp;among the Scythian monarchs. The youth Tυulun,&nbsp;the greateſt of his deſcendants, was exerciſed by thoſe&nbsp;misfortunes which are the ſchool of heroes. He bravely&nbsp;ſtruggled with adverſity, broke the imperious yoke of&nbsp;the Topa, and became the legiſlator of his nation, and&nbsp;the conqueror of Tartary. His troops were diſtributed&nbsp;into regular bands of ιoo and of iqoo men ; cowards&nbsp;were ſtoned to death ; the moſt ſplendid honours were&nbsp;propoſed as the reward of valour ; and Toulun, who&nbsp;had knowledge enough to deſpiſe the learning of China, adopted only ſuch arts and inſtitutions as were fa</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">vourable to the military ſpirit of his government. His&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">tents, which he removed in the winter </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ſeaſon to a more&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">ſouthern latitude, were pitched during the ſummer on&nbsp;the fruitful banks of the Selinga, His conqueſts&nbsp;ſtretched from the Corea far beyond the river Irtiſh.&nbsp;He vanquiſhed, in the country to the north of the Caf-pian ſea, the nation of the Huns ; and the new title of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Khan,</span><span class="font0"> on </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gagan,</span><span class="font0"> expreſſed the ſame and power which&nbsp;he derived from this memorable victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ The chain of events is interrupted, or rather is concealed, as it paſſes from the Volga to the Viſtula, through the dark interval which ſeparates the extreme&nbsp;limits of the Chineſe and of the Roman geography.&nbsp;Yet the temper of the barbarians, and the experience&nbsp;of ſucceſſive emigrations, ſufficiently declare, that the&nbsp;Huns, who were oppreſſed by the arms of the Geougen<sub>t&nbsp;</sub>ſoon withdrew from the preſence of an inſulting victor.&nbsp;The countries towards the Euxine were already occupied by their kindred tribes ; and their haſty flight,&nbsp;which they ſoon converted into a bold attack, would&nbsp;more naturally be directed towards the rich and level&nbsp;plains through which the Viſtula gently flows into the&nbsp;Baltic ſea. The north muſt again have been alarmed&nbsp;and agitated by the invaſion of the Huns ; and the nations- who retreated before them muſt have preſſed&nbsp;with incumbent weight on the confines of Germany.&nbsp;The inhabitants of thoſe regions which the ancients&nbsp;have aſſigned to the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Burgundians, might embrace the resolution of abandoning&nbsp;to the fugitives of Sarmatia their woods and moraſſes ;&nbsp;or at leaſt of diſeharging their ſuperfluous numbers on&nbsp;the provinces of the Roman empire. About ſour years&nbsp;after the victorious Tυulun had aſſumed the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">khan&nbsp;of the Geougen,</span><span class="font0"> another barbarian, the haughty Rho-dogaſt, or Radagaiſus, marched from the northern extremities of Germany almoſt to the gates of Rome, and&nbsp;left the remains of his army to atchieve the deſtruction&nbsp;of the weſt. The Vandals, the Suevi, and the Burgundians, formed the ſtrength of this mighty hoſt : but&nbsp;the Alani, who had found an hoſpitable reception in&nbsp;their new feats, added their active cavalry to the heavy&nbsp;infantry of the Germans ; and the Gothic adventurers crowded ſo eagerly to the ſtandard of Radagaiſus,&nbsp;that by ſome hiſtorians he has been ſtyled the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">king of the&nbsp;Goths.</span><span class="font0"> Twelve thouſand warriors, diſtinguiſhed above&nbsp;the vulgar by their noble birth or their valiant deeds,&nbsp;glittered in the van ; and the whole multitude, which&nbsp;was not leſs than 20c,000 fighting men, might be increaſed by the acceſſion of women, of children, and of&nbsp;ſlaves, to the amount of 400,∞0 perſons. This formidable emigration iſſued from the ſame coaſt of the Baltic which had poured forth the myriads of the Cimbri and Teutones to aſſault Rome and Italy in the vigour of the republic. After the departure of thoſe&nbsp;barbarians, their native country, which was marked by&nbsp;the veſtiges of their greatneſs, long ramparts, and gigantic moles, remained during ſome ages a vaſt and&nbsp;dreary ſolitude ; till the human ſpecies was renewed&nbsp;by the powers of generation, and the vacancy was filled. up by the influx of new inhabitants. The nations&nbsp;who now uſurp an extent, of land which they are unable to cultivate, would ſoon be aſſiſted by the indu»&nbsp;ſtrious poverty of their neighbours, if the government&nbsp;of Europe did not protect the claims of dominion and&nbsp;property.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h4><span class="font1">“ The correſpondence of nations was in that age ſo</span></h4>
