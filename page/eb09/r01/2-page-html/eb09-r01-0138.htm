<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">which he formally intimated his repudiation of the decrees and canons of the church. Such a measure necessarily&nbsp;roused the opposition of those learned bodies by whom the&nbsp;canon law was taught and elaborated, and on 21st April&nbsp;1521 the university of Paris condemned as “heretical,&nbsp;schismatical, impious, and blasphemous ” more than a hundred propositions extracted from Luther’s writings; while,&nbsp;skilfully following up the line of attack · indicated by the&nbsp;supreme pontiff, they enlarged upon the view that Lutheranism was little more than a specious reproduction of errors&nbsp;long ago proscribed and exploded. The university at the&nbsp;same time decreed that Luther’s writings should be burnt;&nbsp;and the sentence was subsequently carried into effect in&nbsp;most of the capitals of Europe. In London the ceremony&nbsp;was performed at Paul’s Cross on the 12th May, and&nbsp;Bishop Fisher in his sermon on the occasion declared that&nbsp;Luther by burning the decretals had made it clear that&nbsp;he would not have hesitated to burn the pope himself had&nbsp;the latter been in his power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Reformation in England had, however, already commenced, and its origin must be looked upon as in a great measure independent of the Lutheran movement; as in&nbsp;Germany, it had been preceded by a kindred movement,&nbsp;an endeavour to bring about a reform of discipline. The&nbsp;nation was not compelled, as in Italy, to witness the corruptions of the papal court, nor were the laity equally&nbsp;oppressed with the people of Germany by imposts and&nbsp;exactions of every kind. But the unsparing extortion&nbsp;practised by Wolsey’s agents after his appointment as&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legatus a latere</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> was severely resented, and appeared all the&nbsp;more grievous when contrasted with that immunity from&nbsp;arbitrary taxation which it was the Englishman’s special&nbsp;boast to inherit as his birthright; and the arbitrary procedure of the ecclesiastical courts and the licentious lives&nbsp;of the clergy were the subjects of loud and continual complaint. In the year 1514 the notable case of Richard&nbsp;Hunne roused popular indignation to the highest pitch.&nbsp;He had been so bold as to resist what he regarded as an&nbsp;unjust exaction of mortuary fees, by pleading in the ecclesiastical court that the action brought against him was unlawful by the Statute of Praemunire,—a plea which virtually&nbsp;raised the whole question of benefit of clergy. Hunne&nbsp;was committed to the Lollards’ Tower and was shortly after&nbsp;found dead,—murdered, as it was popularly believed, by&nbsp;the contrivance of the chancellor of the bishop of London.&nbsp;The case gave rise to a fierce legal controversy, in which&nbsp;the authority of an Act of Parliament was opposed by the&nbsp;precedents established by a decretal of the church. It&nbsp;was followed by the memorable trial of Dr Standish (1515),&nbsp;by which the question of the royal supremacy was distinctly raised, and Henry himself not improbably led&nbsp;to conceive that theory of his legitimate authority in&nbsp;matters ecclesiastical which was afterwards attended with&nbsp;such important results. The state of discipline among the&nbsp;clergy at large was but little, if any, better than in Germany, and their addiction to secular pursuits and pleasures, their covetousness, ambition, and licentiousness are&nbsp;attested not only by satirists like Roy and Skelton, but&nbsp;by grave and temperate censors such as Dean Colet, Archbishop Warham, Bishop Fisher, and Sir Thomas More,&nbsp;and form the subject of their earnest remonstrance and&nbsp;appeals for reform. Wolsey himself, than whom no statesman more clearly discerned the tendencies of the age, was&nbsp;especially anxious to raise the reputation of the whole&nbsp;body for learning and exemplary lives, and it was with&nbsp;this view that he founded Cardinal College (afterwards&nbsp;Christ Church) at Oxford, and invited some of the most&nbsp;promising young scholars at Cambridge to become instructors within its walls.</span></p>

In the disputation at Leipsic he could go so far as to repudiate the divine institution of&nbsp;the papacy and even pronounce against the infallibility of&nbsp;councils. He was still further confirmed in his doctrinal&nbsp;divergence by the influence of Melanchthon, who now began&nbsp;to call in question the doctrine of transubstantiation ; and&nbsp;Valla’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Treatise on the Donation of Constantine</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, with which&nbsp;he first became acquainted in February 1520, would seem&nbsp;to have dispelled the last vestige of doubt in his mind with&nbsp;respect to the essential falsity of the claims of the papacy&nbsp;to temporal power. The contrast now presented by the&nbsp;tone and language of his writings to that of his letter to&nbsp;Leo, written two years before, is startling. In the month&nbsp;of April 1520 appeared his discourse </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Libertóte Christiana,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> inveighing against the abuses of the Curia and referring to Leo himself in terms of open irony. To this&nbsp;succeeded in the following August his appeal, written in&nbsp;the vernacular German, “ To the Christian nobility of&nbsp;the German nation,” wherein he frankly confesses that his&nbsp;reliance is upon none of the ecclesiastical orders, but upon&nbsp;the newly-elected young emperor and the nobles; and he&nbsp;reiterates his demand for a general council,—one that shall&nbsp;be really free, bound by no arbitrary canons, and holding&nbsp;its deliberations free from papal control. This again was&nbsp;succeeded in the ensuing October by his treatise on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Babylonian Captivity of the Church,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> wherein he examines,&nbsp;and for the most part repudiates, the sacramental theories&nbsp;of the mediaeval church. The cause which he advocated&nbsp;now began to assume genuinely European proportions.&nbsp;From Nuremberg came an effective tribute from the youthful meistersánger Hans Sachs to the “ Wittenberg Nightingale,” one of the earliest efforts of his genius. Ulrich&nbsp;von Hutten, at length perceiving the true character of the&nbsp;contest, followed up the address to the German nobility&nbsp;by translating into the vernacular his own treatise </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">To&nbsp;Germans of every Class,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and owing to his persuasions the&nbsp;powerful and chivalrous free knight Franz von Sickingen&nbsp;hastened to declare himself an uncompromising supporter&nbsp;of the Lutheran movement. Together they already discussed plans which included nothing less than the establishment of a national church altogether independent of&nbsp;Rome, with the archbishop of Mainz as its primate. The&nbsp;danger that menaced the Roman see could now no longer&nbsp;be disguised; and in June 1520 Leo fulminated his bull&nbsp;of excommunication against Luther. On the 8th of the&nbsp;following July he addressed a letter to Frederick of Saxony&nbsp;in which he deplores that he can no longer speak of Luther&nbsp;as a son. He feels certain that the elector will prove loyal&nbsp;to the church, although he does not disguise the fact that&nbsp;he has heard of his friendship for the heretical leader and&nbsp;that the latter relies on his support. He has ordered the&nbsp;bull to be circulated among the nobility of Saxony, and he&nbsp;feels equally assured that he may reckon on their assistance&nbsp;in extinguishing this “ incendiary conflagration.” As for&nbsp;Luther himself, he denounces him as one who is seeking to&nbsp;revive the heresies of the Waldenses, the Hussites, and the&nbsp;Bohemians, and who, by the manner in which he has condemned the burning of heretics, has clearly shown that he&nbsp;sympathizes with the Turks and aims at the destruction of&nbsp;the true church.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The bull of excommunication, along with numerous volumes of the decretals, was burnt by Luther himself at&nbsp;Wittenberg in the following December,—a proceeding by</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
