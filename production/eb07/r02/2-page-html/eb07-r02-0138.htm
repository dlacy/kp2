<p><span class="font0">and Syria reduced to a state of dependence on her imperious will, with the Grecian states in the condition of ready instruments in her hands of future aggrandisement, whenever&nbsp;she might be disposed to take or make an opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is even painful to state, that after the conclusion of the Antiochian war, the two Scipios were accused of having&nbsp;received bribes from that monarch, and ofhaving embezzled&nbsp;the public money. Africanus went into voluntary exile at&nbsp;Liternum, where he died the same year that Hannibal fell&nbsp;a victim to the cruel and mean revenge of Rome. Asiaticus refused to pay the fine exacted, and all his property&nbsp;was confiscated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A new Macedonian war soon arose, caused by the imperious authority assumed and exercised by the Roman ambassadors over the conduct of the king. Philip had endured their control with impatience ; but his son Perseus was less&nbsp;able to suppress his dissatisfaction, and hostilities were soon&nbsp;commenced. The war for a time was favourable to tlle Macedonians, who gained one considerable victory, and were&nbsp;successful in several conflicts of smaller importance. At&nbsp;length the command was given to Paulus Æmilius, an old&nbsp;and skilful general, under whose care the aspect of affairs&nbsp;changed. A decisive battle was fought near the city Pydna, remarkable as the conclusion both of the Macedonian&nbsp;kingdom and the Macedonian phalanx. In the first shock&nbsp;of battle the phalanx was irresistible, and bore down all opposition ; but the skilful Roman general, by causing his&nbsp;men to retire fighting, and lead the phalanx upon broken&nbsp;and uneven ground, obliged it to open its dense array of&nbsp;serried pikes, when the legionary soldiers immediately penetrating these openings like a wedge, rent asunder the unwieldy mass, and scattered it into hopeless and irretrievable&nbsp;confusion and rout, like the bursting of a cloud of vapour by&nbsp;a whirlwind. Perseus was captured soon after the battle,&nbsp;and reserved to grace the victor’s triumph. Macedonia,&nbsp;Epirus, and Illyricum, were reduced to the condition of provinces, and the foundation of a foreign territorial empire laid,&nbsp;was instead of one merely of influence and military power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The utter destruction of Carthage was next resolved upon, partly through the vindictive remembrance ofthe terror&nbsp;which Rome had formerly felt from Carthaginian prowess,&nbsp;partly from the instigation of the stern, haughty, and implacable Cato the censor. A pretext fbr a war was not difficult to find, though the Carthaginians endeavoured to avert&nbsp;their fate by even the most abject submission. But when&nbsp;the Romans, after inducing them to yield up their weapons,&nbsp;informed them that they must abandon their city, witness&nbsp;its demolition, and remove to a new position remote from&nbsp;the sea, despair itself roused them to make the fiercest resistance. They sprung at once into an attitude of the most&nbsp;determined defiance, forged new weapons, framed new military engines, the women cutting off their hair to form&nbsp;ropes to work their machinery ; and clad in glittering panoply, they manned their walls, and met the unappeasable&nbsp;hatred of Rome with hatred not less keen and mortal. The&nbsp;Roman armies sustained several reverses ; but under the&nbsp;command of Scipio Æmilianus, son of Paulus Æmilius, and&nbsp;adopted son of Scipio Africanus, victory again began to&nbsp;crown their efforts. After a fierce and protracted struggle,&nbsp;the Romans forced their way into the city on the side next&nbsp;the port, and obtained possession of the city wall. But the&nbsp;conflict was not over though the city wall was seized. The&nbsp;Carthaginians fought from street to street, from house to&nbsp;house ; and the Romans gained the city but by yards and&nbsp;inches, every house being contested from the ground floor&nbsp;to the roof, like a separate fortress. At length all was carried but the citadel and the temple of Æsculapius. These&nbsp;the Romans were prepared to storm, when the citadel surrendered, Asdrubal, who had the command, yielding to Scipio,&nbsp;on condition that his life should be spared. Those who had&nbsp;fled to the temnle, some of whom were deserters from the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Roman army, prepared to destroy it and themselves by fire, rather than fall into the hands of the Romans. Among&nbsp;these was the wife of Asdrubal, who had been placed in the&nbsp;temple before her husband yielded to Scipio. Seeing&nbsp;Asdrubal along with the Roman general, and detesting his&nbsp;cowardice, she arrayed herself in her richest attire, took her&nbsp;two children with her, and displaying herself on the top of the&nbsp;temple, upbraided her husband, stabbed her two children&nbsp;before his face, and threw them into the flames, which were&nbsp;now bursting furiously from the interior. She then sprung&nbsp;after them into the heart of the blazing ruin. Thus perished Carthage, leaving Rome to pursue unrivalled her guilty&nbsp;and self-destroying career.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While the third Punic war was still raging, hostilities again broke out in Macedonia, excited by an impostor&nbsp;named Andriscus, who, pretending to be the son of Philip,&nbsp;instigated the disaffected Macedonians to throw off the Roman yoke, and forming an alliance with the Thracians,&nbsp;strove to accomplish his purpose by force of arms. Metellus, after a short struggle, overpowered the insurgent Macedonians, and then attempted to procure the dissolution of&nbsp;the Achæan league. This led to the Achæan war, which&nbsp;terminated in the complete subjugation of Greece, and its&nbsp;reduction to the form of a Roman province. Mummius&nbsp;tlle consul, who conducted this war, sacked and burned Corinth ; and after having pillaged the city of its most&nbsp;valuable effects, its rich paintings and beautiful sculptures,&nbsp;demolished its walls, temples, and public buildings, and reduced it to a heap of blackened ruins. The plundered ornaments of Corinth were sent by the consul to Rome ; and it&nbsp;has been recorded, proving at once his care and his ignorance, that he stipulated with the masters of the vessels employed in transporting these matchless treasures of art, that&nbsp;“ if they suffered any of them to be lost or injured, they&nbsp;should furnish others in their stead.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another enemy of still more stubborn mould continued to engage the attention of Rome, and to put to the severest&nbsp;test the courage of her armies and the skill of her generals.&nbsp;The wars and conquests of the Carthaginians in Spain had&nbsp;directed the attention of the Romans to that country ; and&nbsp;a war for the awowed purpose of its subjugation was begun&nbsp;soon after the expulsion of the Carthaginians. Partly in&nbsp;consequence ofthe defensible nature of the country, abounding in mountain ridges and deep and rapid streams, and&nbsp;partly from the brave and determined character of the inhabitants, the war was protracted, obstinate, and bloody.&nbsp;Repeatedly did the arms of Rome sustain signal reverses;&nbsp;and still with invincible energy of will was the contest maintained. At length the Lusitanians obtained a leader undeι&nbsp;whom they seemed likely to secure their possession of liberty and independence. This was Viriatus, a shepherd,&nbsp;a hunter, a robber, and finally a military hero, almost unrivalled in fertility of resources under defeat, skill in the conduct of his forces, and courage in the hour of battle. Like&nbsp;the guerilla leaders of modern times, he knew how to avail&nbsp;himself of the wild chivalry of his countrymen, and the almost impenetrable fastnesses of his country ; but, superior&nbsp;to them, he was equally able to guide a troop and to marshall an army. Six years did he maintain the contest ; and&nbsp;at length the consul Cæpio, unable to subdue him in the&nbsp;field, procured his assassination. The Lusitanians, deprived of tbeir brave leader, were soon afterwards completely&nbsp;subdued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Undismayed by the overthrow of their countrymen, tlle Numantines still maintained the unequal conflict against&nbsp;the collected might of Rome. Pompey was baffled; his&nbsp;successor Mancinus shared a similar disgrace ; and at length&nbsp;the Romans raised Scipio Æmilianus, the conqueror of Carthage, to the consulship, and assigned him Spain as his province, and even prolonged his command, after thc expiration&nbsp;of his year as proconsul. At the head of a large army he</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
