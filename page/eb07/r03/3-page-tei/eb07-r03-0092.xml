In some parts, the reprobated system of two corn crops succeeding a fallow is still continued. In other , parts, after a fallow, barley is sown with clover ; the clover is mowed in two years, or sometimes fed the second year, and then, after one ploughing, the land is sown with wheat. In some cases, on the lighter lands, the four-course system of turnips, barley, clover, and wheat, is followed. The wheat of Rutlandshire is highly valued for seed, and is much in request in even very distant counties. Nearly two thirds of the land are tithe free, and in all the late enclosures, provisions to that end have been inserted in the acts of parliament for effecting them. The cows of Rutlandshire are remarkable for the richness of their milk, though they yield but a small quantity. The rich cheese commonly known as Stilton is chiefly made in the dairies of this county. As many oxen are brought from the more northern countries, and fattened in Rutlandshire, as are bred within it, the annua! number of each being from 2700 to 3000. The sheep are more numerous in proportion than horned cattle. Mr Parkinson calculated them to be about 80,000 ; consisting of old and new Leicesters, of Southdowns, and a few Lin-colnshires. It has been remarked, that though the quality of the wool has increased in fineness, the diminution in the weight of the fleeces has of late years more than counterbalanced that advantage.</p><p>The small rivulets that water this district run into the two rivers, the Guash, or Wash, which passes through it, or the Walland, which forms its southern boundary. The latter river is navigable only to Stamford, on the confines of Rutlandshire ; but is useful in opening a communication with the ocean. A canal has been constructed from Oke-ham to Melton-Mowbray, by which a supply of coals has been drawn from the mines of Leicestershire.</p><p>Rutlandshire is neither a manufacturing nor a mineral district, but depends exclusively on its agriculture. By the returns of 1801 the inhabitants were 16,356, viz. 7978 males, and 8378 females; in 1811 the numbers were 16,380, viz. 7931 males, and 8+19 females; in 1821 they were 18,487, viz. 9223 males, and 9264 females ; and in 1831 the numbers were 19,385, viz. 9721 males, and 9664 females. Of these there were 2299 families chiefly employed in agriculture ; 1102 families chiefly employed in trade, manufactures, and handicraft ; and 790 not comprised in any of these classes.</p><p>RUTNAGIRI, a town of Hindustan, in the territories of the Nagpoor Mahrattas, and province of Bejapoor, on the east coast of the Concan district.

It is situated in a remarkably productive and fertile country compared with the rest of the province, which is desolate and barren. This place is said to have been in possession of a family of Rajpoot Hindus from time immemorial. Their last independent chief, Sindar Sing, was, after a severe contest, subdued by Rago-gee Bounsia, the founder of the Nagpoor dynasty. It was here that a number of French troops, who were endeavouring to effect a retreat from Bahar through the country into the Deccan, halted, when they were entertained for a few days by Bombajee, the Mahratta sovereign, and at the end of that time treacherously murdered. The travelling distance from Calcutta by Chuta Nagpoor is 493 miles, from Nag-poor 220 miles, from Delhi 633, from Poonah 706 miles. Long. 82. 35. E. Lat. 22. 16.

After making great progress at home, he repaired to Leyden, and there prosecuted the study of anatomy and botany. He next studied at Franeker, where he obtained the degree of doctor of physic, He then returned</p><p>to the Hague, and marrying in 1661, dedicated his whole time to the study of his profession. In 1665 he published a treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">Dihicidatw Valvularum de variis Lymphaticis et Lacteis,</hi>  which raised his reputation so high that ∙ he was chosen professor of anatomy at Amsterdam. This honour he accepted with the more pleasure, because his situation at Amsterdam would have given him easy access to every requisite help for cultivating anatomy and natural history. After he settled in Amsterdam, he was perpetually engaged in dissecting, and in examining with the most inquisitive eye, the various parts of the human body. He improved the science of anatomy by new discoveries ; and, in particular, he found out a way to preserve dead bodies many years from putrefaction. His anatomical collection was curious and valuable. He had a series of foetuses of all sizes, from the length of the little finger to that of a newborn infant. He had also bodies of full-grown persons of all ages, and a vast number of animals of almost every species on the globe, besides a great many other natural curiosities. Peter the Great of Russia, in his tour through Holland in the year 1698, visited Ruysch, and was so charmed with his conversation, that he passed whole days with him ; and when the hour of departure came, he left him with regret. He set so high a value on Ruysch⅛ cabinet of curiosities, that when he returned to Holland in 1717, he purchased it for thirty thousand florins, and sent it to St Petersburg.</p><p>In 1685 he was made professor of medicine, an office which he discharged with great ability. In 1728 he got his thigh-bone broken by a fall in his chamber. The year before this misfortune happened, he had been deprived of his son Henry, a youth of talents, and well skilled in anatomy and botany, who had been created a doctor of physic, and was supposed to have assisted his father in his discoveries and publications. Ruysch’s family now consisted only of his youngest daughter. This lady had been early inspired with a passion for anatomy, the favourite science of her father and brother, and had studied it with success. She was therefore well qualified to assist her father in forming a second collection of curiosities in natural history and anatomy, which he began to make after the emperor of Russia had purchased the first. Ruysch is said to have been of so healthy a constitution, that though he lived to the age of ninety-three, yet during that long period he did not labour above a month under the infirmities of disease. From the time he broke his thigh he was indeed disabled from walking without a support ; yet he retained his vigour both of body and mind without any sensible alteration, until in 1731 his strength at once deserted him. He died on the 22d of February the same year. His anatomical works are printed in four vols. 4to.</p><p>The style of his writings is simple and concise, but sometimes inaccurate. Instruction, and not ostentation, seems to be his only aim. In anatomy he undoubtedly made many discoveries ; but from not being sufficiently conversant with the WTitings of other anatomists, he published as discoveries what had been known before. The Academy of Sciences at Paris in 1727 elected him an honorary member, in place of Sir Isaac Newton, who had lately deceased. He was also a member of the Royal Society of London.</p><p>R U YSSELEDE, a town of Belgium, in the province of West Flanders and circle of Bruges.
