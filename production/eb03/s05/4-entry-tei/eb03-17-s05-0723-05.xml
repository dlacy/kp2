 a branch of the perpetual revenue. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Revenue.</hi></p><p>In Great Britain there is a tax impoſed upon all parchment and paper, whereon any legal proceedings or private inſtruments of almost any nature whatſoever are written ; and alſo upon licences for retailing wines, of all denominations ; upon all almanacs, newspapers, advertiſements, cards, dice, &amp;c. Theſe impoſts are very various ; being higher or lower, not ſo much according to the value of the property transferred, as according to the nature of the deed.<note anchored="false" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Smith's Wealth of Nations, vol. iii.</p></note> The highest do not exceed six pounds upon every sheet of paper or ſkin of parchment ; and theſe high duties fall chiefly upon grants from the crown, and upon certain law proceedings, without any regard to the value of the ſubject. There are in Great Britain no duties on the registration of deeds or writings, except the fees of the officers who keep the regiſter ; and theſe are ſeldom more than a reaſonable recompenſe for their labour. The crown derives no revenue from them.</p><p>The ſtamp-duties constitute a tax which, though in ſome inſtances it may be heavily felt, by greatly increaſing the expence of all mercantile as well as legal proceedings, yet (if moderately impoſed) is of ſervice to the public in general, by authenticating inſtruments, and rendering it much more difficult than formerly to forge deeds of any standing ; ſince, as the officers of this branch of the revenue vary their stamps frequently, by marks perceptible to none but themſelves, a man that would forge a deed of King William’s time, muſt know and be able to counterfeit the stamp of that date alſo. In France and ſome other countries the duty is laid on the contract itſelf, not on the instrument in which it is contained; as, with us too in England (beſides the stamps on the indentures), a tax is laid, by statute 8 Ann. c. 9. on every apprentice-fee; of 6d in the pound if it be 50l. or under, and is in the pound if a greater ſum : but this tends to draw the ſubject into a thouſand nice disquisitions and diſputes concerning the nature of his contract, and whether taxable or not ; in which the farmers of the tevenue are ſure to have the advantage. Our general method anſwers the purpoſes of the state as well, and conſults the ease of the ſubject much better. The first inſtitution of the ſtamp- duties was by statute 5 and 6 W. and M. c. 21. and they have since, in many inſtances, been increaſed to five times their original amount.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
