He began his career by composing a few operas, among them <hi rend="italic">Amletο,</hi> produced at Rome in 1715, and remarkable as the earliest known attempt to pose Shakespeare’s hero as the <hi rend="italic">primο uοmο</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">dramma per la musica.</hi> But his real strength lay in the excellence of his performances on the harpsichord and organ. During Handel’s first sojourn in Italy in 1708-9 D. Scarlatti was invited to a trial of skill with him on both instruments at the palace of Cardinal Ottoboni, and all present decided that the harpsichord performances terminated in a drawn battle, though Handel had a decided advantage on the organ. The justice of the verdict cannot be doubted ; for, whenever Scarlatti was afterwards praised for his organ-playing, he used to cross himself devoutly and say, “ You should hear Handel! ”</p><p>On the death of Bai in 1715 D. Scarlatti was appointed maestro di cappella of St Peter’s in Rome. In 1719 he conducted the performance of his <hi rend="italic">Narciso</hi> at the King’s Theatre in London, and in 1721 he played with great success in Lisbon. He then returned to Naples; but in 1729 he was invited to Madrid, with the appointment of teacher to the princess of Asturias, and remained there twenty-five years, returning in 1754 to Naples, where he died in 1757.</p><p>D. Scarlatti’s compositions for the harpsichord are almost innumerable, and many of them have been published. In the character of their <hi rend="italic">technique</hi> they are infinitely in advance of the age in which they were written and played ; and many of them are difficult enough to tax the powers of the best performers of the present day.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
