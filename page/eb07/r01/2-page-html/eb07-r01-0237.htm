<p><span class="font0">nobles found fault with his conduct, and persuaded the king to discard him. The cardinal, for his part, was unmoved,&nbsp;and by his reasonings overthrew what was thought to be determined against him ; so that, instead of being disgraced,&nbsp;he from that moment became more powerful than ever.&nbsp;He punished all his enemies in the same manner as they&nbsp;would have punished him ; and the day which produced&nbsp;this event, so glorious to Cardinal de Richelieu, was called&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">day of dupes.</span><span class="font0"> This able minister had from thence&nbsp;forward an ascendency over the king’s mind ; and he now&nbsp;resolved to humble the excessive pride of the house of Austria. For that purpose he concluded a treaty with Gustavus Adolphus king of Sweden, for carrying the war into&nbsp;the heart of Germany. He also entered into a league with&nbsp;the duke of Bavaria ; secured Lorraine ; raised a part of&nbsp;the princes of the empire against the emperor; treated&nbsp;with the Dutch to continue the war against Spain ; favoured the Catalans and Portuguese till they shook off the Spanish yoke ; and, in short, took so many different measures,&nbsp;that he accomplished his design ; and after having carried&nbsp;on the war with success, was thinking of concluding it by&nbsp;a peace, when he died at Paris on the 4th of December&nbsp;1642, aged fifty-eight. He was interred in the Sorbonne,&nbsp;where a magnificent mausoleum is erected to his memory.&nbsp;This great politician made the arts and sciences flourish ;&nbsp;formed the botanical garden at Paris, called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">king’s garden ;</span><span class="font0"> founded the French academy ; established the royal&nbsp;printing-house ; erected the palace afterwards called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Le&nbsp;Palais Royal,</span><span class="font0"> which he presented to the king ; and rebuilt&nbsp;the Sorbonne with a magnificence that appears truly royal.&nbsp;Besides his books of controversy and piety, there pass under the name of this minister, a Journal, in 2 vols. 12mo ;&nbsp;and a Political Testament, in 12mo; all treating of politics&nbsp;and state affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Richelieu, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sοrell,</span><span class="font0"> a river of Lower Canada, flowing in a northerly direction from Lake Champlain to the great&nbsp;St Lawrence. It is the principal channel by which the&nbsp;waters of the lake are conveyed to the latter river ; and by&nbsp;being made navigable for vessels of large size throughout&nbsp;its whole extent, it would afford a most convenient means&nbsp;of commercial intercourse with the interior of New York,&nbsp;and form a direct chain of communication with the great&nbsp;western republic. This river is remarkable for being&nbsp;much narrower at its embouchure than at the place from&nbsp;which it flows. From its mouth to the basin of Chamblay&nbsp;it is about two hundred and fifty yards wide ; thence to&nbsp;the Isle du Portage the breadth is five hundred yards ; beyond this it expands to double that size, and continues to&nbsp;enlarge up to St John’s, from which there is a ship-navigation to the towns on Lake Champlain. From Chamblay&nbsp;downwards to the St Lawrence the current is regular and&nbsp;gentle ; but from Lake Champlain to the basin it is hurried,&nbsp;in some places violent, and in others broken by rapids.&nbsp;The channel is, however, of great value and importance, and&nbsp;the medium of considerable trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RICHELIEU </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Islands,</span><span class="font0"> a cluster of islands, about a hundred in number, in the river St Lawrence, situated at the southwest entrance of Lake St Peter. They lie low, and are&nbsp;liable to be overflowed in spring, when the lake is swelled&nbsp;by the melting of snow and ice. Some of them afford good&nbsp;pasturage for cattle, and they all abound with wild fowl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RICHES, a word used always in the plural number, means wealth, money, possession, or a splendid sumptuous&nbsp;appearance. When used to express the fortune of private&nbsp;persons, whether patrimonial or acquired, it signifies </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">opulence ;</span><span class="font0"> a term which expresses not the enjoyment, but the&nbsp;possession, of numerous superfluities. By the riches of a&nbsp;state or kingdom we mean the produce of industry, of commerce, of different incorporated bodies, of the internal and&nbsp;external administration of the principal members of which&nbsp;the society is composed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RICHMOND, a city, port of entry, and the metropolis </span><span class="font2"></span><span class="font0">of Virginia, one of the United States of North America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is situated on the north bank of James River, just below <sup></sup>the falls, one hundred and fifty miles from the mouth of the <sub></sub>river, and one hundred and twenty-three south-west from Washington. The situation of tllis city is alike picturesque,&nbsp;salubrious, and favourable for commerce. The public buildings are numerous, and some considerable manufactures&nbsp;are here carried on. The capitol, a handsome structure,&nbsp;occupies a commanding situation on a rising ground.&nbsp;Among the churches, that called the Monumental Church&nbsp;is most beautiful and conspicuous. It is erected on the&nbsp;spot where, in 1811, the theatre of Richmond w<sup>,</sup>as burned&nbsp;to the ground during the performance, and above seventy&nbsp;persons perished in the flames. A monument in front commemorates the event, and hence the name of the church.&nbsp;There are a number of other religious houses, a sufficiency&nbsp;of good schools, and a well-regulated penitentiary. Richmond is the natural depot of tobacco, wheat, and hemp,&nbsp;raised in the populous county watered by the river. The&nbsp;falls extend six miles, during which space the James descends eighty feet. A canal passes around these falls, and&nbsp;the river is navigable for batteaux two hundred and twenty&nbsp;miles above them ; by this means the city is connected&nbsp;with a very extensive and productive back country. The&nbsp;inland, coasting, and foreign trade is extensive. Manchester, on the opposite side of the river, is connected with it&nbsp;by means of bridges. In 1830 the population amounted to&nbsp;16,060 ; in 1839 it may be estimated at about 20,000.&nbsp;Long. 77. 21. W. Lat. 37. 32. N.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(r. R. r.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Richmond, a town of the county of Surrey, in the hundred of Kingston, nine miles from London, on the right bank of the river Thames, over which is an elegant bridge&nbsp;leading to Twickenham. It was anciently called Sheen,&nbsp;and a palace adjoining was long the residence of our monarchs. The park still belongs to the crown. A hill rises&nbsp;from the town, of great celebrity for the extent and beauty&nbsp;of the prospect which it affords. The brow of the hill has&nbsp;a delightful promenade, and is adorned by residences of&nbsp;great taste and magnificence, and by hotels, where every&nbsp;accommodation that luxury can desire is supplied, though&nbsp;at the most extravagant prices. Other houses of the purest&nbsp;taste are built along the bank, and to the edge of the river.&nbsp;The vicinity to the royal gardens of Kew form an inducement to a residence at this delightful place, which is one of&nbsp;the desirable retreats from the metropolis. It has a neat&nbsp;parish church, or rather chapel to Kingston. The population amounted in 1801 to 4628, in 1811 to 5219, in 1821&nbsp;to 5994, and in 1831 to 7243.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Richmond, a market and borough town of the north riding of the county of York, 254 miles from London. It&nbsp;stands on the east side of a steep hill rising from the banks&nbsp;of the river Swale, which nearly encircles the town. It is&nbsp;finely situated, and well built. It was fortified in ancient&nbsp;times, and probably more populous than it is at present. It&nbsp;now gives the title of duke to one branch of the illegitimate&nbsp;descendants of Charles H. It returns two members to the&nbsp;House of Commons, and is governed by a mayor, four aldermen, and eleven councillors. The country around it is&nbsp;celebrated for its breed of horses, and annual races are still&nbsp;held near it. There is a good market on Saturday. The&nbsp;population amounted in 1821 to 3546, and in 1831 to 3900.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RICKMANSWORTH, a market-town of the county of Hertford. It is in the hundred of Cashio, seventeen miles&nbsp;from London, and stands at the spot where the river Gade&nbsp;falls into the Colne, which latter forms a part of the Grand&nbsp;Junction Canal. It is also near the course of the railway&nbsp;by which London is connected with Birmingham, and is&nbsp;thus highly favoured with respect to the facilities of communication. The church is a fine large fabric of an ancient date. The town has some trade in straw-hats and in</span></p>
