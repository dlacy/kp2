<p><span class="font0">RACE, in general, signifies running with others in order to obtain a prize, either on foot, or by riding on horseback,&nbsp;in chariots, or otherwise. The race was one of the exercises amongst the ancient Grecian games, which was performed in a course containing one hundred and twenty-five&nbsp;yards ; and those who contended in the foot races were&nbsp;Irequently clothed in armour. Chariot and horse races also&nbsp;formed a part of the ancient games.  Races were known in&nbsp;England in very early times. Fitzstephen, who wrote in&nbsp;the days of Henry II. mentions the great delight which the&nbsp;citizens of London took in this diversion. From his words,&nbsp;however, it does not appear to have been designed for the&nbsp;purposes of gaming, but merely to have sprung from a generous emulation of showing superior skill in horsemanship. Races appear to have been in vogue in the reign of&nbsp;Elizabeth, and to have been carried to such excess as to&nbsp;injure the fortunes of the nobility. George earl of Cumberland is recorded to have wasted more of his estate than&nbsp;any of his ancestors, and chiefly by his extreme love of&nbsp;horse-races, tiltings, and other expensive diversions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RACINE, John, a great and illustrious French poet, was bom at Ferte-Milon on the 21st of December. 1630. He was&nbsp;the son of John Racine, controller of the salt magazine of&nbsp;that city, and of Joan Sconin, daughter of the king’s warden&nbsp;of thewoods and waters Of Villers-Caterets. Deprived of his&nbsp;father and mother at the early age of three, he passed under&nbsp;tile guardianship of his paternal grandfather, also named John&nbsp;Racine, who, not long afterwards, bequeathed the trust to&nbsp;his widow. He studied first at Beauvais ; next at Paris, in the&nbsp;college of Fearcount; and lastly at Port-Royal-des-Champs,&nbsp;whither a number of eminent persons had retired to devote&nbsp;themselves to piety and the instruction of youth, amongst&nbsp;whom were the advocate Lemaitre, Dr. Hamon, Nicole,&nbsp;Lacy, and Launcelot, authors of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Logic,</span><span class="font0"> the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">General&nbsp;Grammar,</span><span class="font0"> and other works, known under the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Me·&nbsp;thodes de Port-Royal.</span><span class="font0"> Launcelot, in particular, undertook to teach Greek to the youthful Racine. But besides&nbsp;the taste for sound literature and serious studies, these mn-mortal solitaries inspired their pupil with those religious&nbsp;principles which never abandoned him, and which were&nbsp;common to an the great writers and great men of that age.&nbsp;The docility of Racine towards his masters equalled his ardour for study. On one occasion, however, he showed himself refractory. Having accidentally met with the Greek&nbsp;romance of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Theagenes and Chariclea,</span><span class="font0"> he commenced the&nbsp;perusal of this work of fiction, when his master surprising&nbsp;him, whilst thus engaged, took from him the book, and consigned it to the flames. The youth procured another copy,&nbsp;and learned it by heart, after which he placed it in the hands&nbsp;of Launcelot, saying, “ You may bum this also.” An act&nbsp;of disobedience of a kind so novel was the more readily excused because it was not likely to have many imitators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first poetical essay of Racine was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">La Nymphe de la Seine,</span><span class="font0"> an ode which he composed for the marriage of Louis&nbsp;XIV. and which having made him known to Chaplain, the&nbsp;temporary arbiter of literary reputations and court favours,&nbsp;produced him a hundred louis, which Colbert sent him on&nbsp;the part of the king ; and not long afterwards, he received a&nbsp;pension of six hundred livres. Four years later, towards&nbsp;the close of 1663, another ode, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">La Renommée aux Muses,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">composed on the occasion of the establishment of the three&nbsp;Academies, procured for him a second royal gratuity, the&nbsp;order for which was couched in terms peculiarly flattering&nbsp;to the youthful poet. This ode, though inferior to the preceding, was nevertheless more fortunate. Recompensed,&nbsp;like the other, by the king, it had the good fortune to be&nbsp;criticised by Boileau. The poet took an early opportunity&nbsp;to thank the critic, and this proved the origin of that connexion so intimate, so honourable, so useful to Racine, and&nbsp;which was not one of the least advantages which fortune&nbsp;gave him over Corneille. A little before this period, Racine had made the acquaintance of Molière, and had communicated to him a tragedy, entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Theagene et Chari-clee,</span><span class="font0"> taken from the romance, which had afforded him such&nbsp;delight at Port-Royal. Molière, disapproving of this production, gave him the plan of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Thébaide, ou les Frères Ennemis,</span><span class="font0"> a subject on which it is alleged that he had himself&nbsp;been engaged. Racine executed the design, and the piece&nbsp;had some success. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Alexandre,</span><span class="font0"> which was performed the&nbsp;following year, 1665, met with a still more favourable reception, and showed great progress in the versification of&nbsp;the author, who was then only twenty-five years of age.&nbsp;But, excepting the verses, neither of these works gave any&nbsp;indication of what Racine afterwards proved. They were&nbsp;but feeble imitations of Corneille, of whom, by a misfortune&nbsp;common to all imitators, Racine had only adopted the defects ; that is, the cold gallantry mixed with heroism, the&nbsp;idle maxims, the metaphysical reasonings, and the elaborate declamation. Corneille, to whom Racine read his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Alexandre,</span><span class="font0"> counselled him, it is said, to write no more tragedies.&nbsp;At a subsequent period the same advice was given to Voltaire by Fontenelle, after the reading of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Brutus.</span><span class="font0"> But it is&nbsp;fortunate for letters that such counsels are never followed.&nbsp;Voltaire replied to Fontenelle by the production of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Zaire,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and Racine responded to Comeille by that of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Andro-maque.</span><span class="font0"> Finding himself pursuing a wrong direction, he&nbsp;suddenly changed his route and took a different one, unknown perhaps even to Comeille himself. The latter had&nbsp;astonished and surprised his audience; his young rival sought&nbsp;to move and to soften them. Pity appeared to him a tragic&nbsp;resource more active, more extensive, and of an effect more&nbsp;penetrating and less transitory, than admiration. He studied the human heart, its passions, its weaknesses, and its&nbsp;most secret recesses, and there he discovered a species of&nbsp;tragedy altogether new, of which he gave the first and probably most inimitable model in his</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"> Andromaque ;</span><span class="font0"> that one of&nbsp;all his tragedies which, without being the most perfect, produces the greatest effect on the stage, by the vigorous and&nbsp;just expression of the sentiments and characters, and by the&nbsp;alternations of hope and fear, of terror and pity, with which&nbsp;the poet agitates the soul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The representation of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Andromaque</span><span class="font0"> in 1667, was followed almost every year by a new masterpiece. But at first Racine surprised the public by an excursion into the domain of Molière. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Plaideurs,</span><span class="font0"> imitated from the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Wasps&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of Aristophanes, is a comedy the plot of which is somewhat&nbsp;feeble and inartificial ; but in nature, truth, facility, and</span></p>
