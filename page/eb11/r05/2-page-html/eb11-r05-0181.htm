<p><span class="font0">of Oyama's forces (January 8th-i6th) the only change in the relative positions of Oyama and Kuropatkin as they stood after the battle&nbsp;of the Sha-ho was that the Japanese had extended somewhat westwards towards the Hun-ho.. The Russians, 300,000 strong, were&nbsp;now organized in three armies, commanded by Generals Linievich,&nbsp;Grippenberg and Kaulbars; the total strength of the Japanese&nbsp;1st, 2nd and 4th Armies and reserve was estimated by the Russians&nbsp;at 220,000. Towards the end of January, Kuropatkin took the&nbsp;offensive. He wished to inflict a severe blow before the enemy&nbsp;could be reinforced by the late besiegers of Port Arthur, and sent&nbsp;Grippenberg with seven divisions against Oku’s two on the Japanese&nbsp;left. The battle of Sandepu (Heikoutai), fought in a terrible snowstorm on the 26th and 27th of January 1905, came near to being a&nbsp;great Russian victory. But the usual </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">décousu</span><span class="font0"> of Russian operations&nbsp;and their own magnificent resistance saved the Japanese, and after&nbsp;two days' severe fighting, although Grippenberg had not been&nbsp;checked, Kuropatkin, in face of a counter-attack by Oyama, decided&nbsp;to abandon the attempt. The losses were roughly 8000 Japanese&nbsp;to over 10,000 Russians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Both sides stood fast in the old positions up to the verge of the last and greatest battle. Kuropatkin was reinforced, and&nbsp;appointed Kaulbars to succeed Grippenberg and Bilderling to&nbsp;the command of the 3rd Army vacated by Kaulbars. On the&nbsp;other hand, Nogi’s 3rd Army, released by the fall of Port Arthur,&nbsp;was brought up on the Japanese left, and a new army under&nbsp;Kawamura (5th), formed of one of the Port Arthur and two&nbsp;reserve divisions, was working from the upper Yalu through the *&nbsp;mountains towards the Russian left rear. The Russian line in&nbsp;front of Mukden from the Hun-ho, through the Putilov and&nbsp;Novgorod Kills on the Sha-ho, to the mountains, was 47 m.&nbsp;long, the armies from right to left being II. (Kaulbars), III.&nbsp;(Bilderling) and I. (Linievich); a general reserve was at Mukden.&nbsp;On the other side from left to right, on a line 40 m. long, were&nbsp;Oku (2nd Army), Nozu (4th), Kuroki (1st) and Kawamura&nbsp;(5th), the general reserve in rear of the centre at Yentai and the&nbsp;3rd Army in rear of Oku. Each side had about 310,000 men&nbsp;present. The entire front of both armies was heavily entrenched. The Russians had another offensive in contemplation&nbsp;when the Japanese forestalled them by advancing on the 21st&nbsp;of February. The 5th Army gradually drove in Kuropatkin’s&nbsp;small detachments in the mountains, and came up&nbsp;in line with Kuroki, threatening to envelop the Russian&nbsp;left. The events on this side and misleading information&nbsp;induced Kuropatkin to pay particular attention to his left.&nbsp;The Japanese 1st and $th Armies were now engaged (25th&nbsp;February), and elsewhere all was quiet. But on the 27th the&nbsp;fighting spread to the centre, and Nogi (originally behind Oku)&nbsp;was on the march to envelop the Russian right. He was held&nbsp;under observation throughout by Russian cavalry, but it seems&nbsp;that little attention was paid to their reports by Kuropatkin,&nbsp;who was still occupied with Kuroki and Kawamura, and even&nbsp;denuded his right of its reserves to reinforce his left. With a&nbsp;battle-front exceeding two days’ marches the wrong distribution&nbsp;of reserves by both sides was a grave misfortune. Kuropatkin&nbsp;was at last convinced, on the 28th of February, of the danger&nbsp;from the west, and did all in his power to form a solid line of&nbsp;defence on the west side of Mukden. Nogi’s first attack (ist-2nd March) had not much success, and a heavy counterstroke&nbsp;was delivered on the 2nd. Fighting for localities and alterations in the. interior distribution of the opposing forces occupied&nbsp;much time,’ and by the 3rd, though the battle had become&nbsp;severe, Kuropatkin had merely drawn in his right and right&nbsp;centre (now facing W. and S.W. respectively) a little nearer&nbsp;Mukden. His centre on the Sha-ho held firm, Kuroki and&nbsp;Kawamura made but slight progress against his left in the&nbsp;mountains. Nogi and Oyama were equally impressed with the&nbsp;strength of the new (west) Russian front, and like Grant, at&nbsp;Petersburg in 1864, extended farther and farther to the outer&nbsp;flank, the Russians following suit. The Japanese marshal now&nbsp;sent up his army reserve, which had been kept far to the rear&nbsp;at Yentai, to help Nogi. It was not before the evening of the&nbsp;6th of March that it came up with the 3rd Army and was placed&nbsp;in position opposite the centre of the Russian west front.
