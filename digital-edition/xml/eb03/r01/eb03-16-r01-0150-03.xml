island, an iſland in the South Sea, diſcovered by the French on the 16th December 1773; lying, according to M. de Pages, in latitude 48° 21", and longitude 66° 47", the variation of the needle being 30° always towards north-weſt. The road and harbour are extremely good, and the latter from 16 to 8 fathoms deep at the very ſhore. The coaſt on each ſide is lofty, but gteen, with an abrupt deſcent, and ſwarms with a ſpecies of buſtards. The penguins and ſea-lions, which ſwarmed on the ſands, were nowiſe alarmed at the approach of thoſe who landed; from whence M. de Pages concluded that the country was wholly uninhabited. The foil produces a kind of grafs, about live .inches long, with a broad black leaf, and ſeemingly of a rich quality—but there was no veſtige of a tree or</p><p>human habitation, See <hi rend="italic">Travels round the Wοrld</hi> by M. de Pages, Vol. III. chap. viii. and ix.</p>
