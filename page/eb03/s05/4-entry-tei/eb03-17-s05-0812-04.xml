in a ſhip, certain ſhort pieces of rope, which are usually knotted at one or both ends, according to the purpoſe for which they are deſigned. They are either uſed to ſuſpend any heavy body, or to retain a cable, ſhroud, &amp;c. in a fixed poſition. Thus, the anchors, when firſt hoiſted up from the ground, are hung to the cat-head by a ſtopper attached to the latter, which paſſing through the anchor-ring, is afterwards faſtened to the timber-head ; and the ſame rope ſerves to faſten, it on the bow at ſea ; or to ſuſpend it by the ring which is to be sunk from the ſhip to the bottom. The stoppers of the cable have a large knot and a laniard at one end, and are faſtened to a ring-bolt in the deck by the other. They are attached to the cable by the laniard, which is fastened ſecurely round both by ſeveral turns passed behind the knot, or about the neck of the ſtopper ; by which means the cable is reſtrained from running out of the ſhip when ſhe rides at anchor.</p><p>The ſtoppers of the ſhroud have a knot and a laniard at each end. They are only uſed when the ſhrouds are cut aſunder in battle, or diſabled by tempeſtuous weather ; at which time they are laſhed, in the same manner as thoſe of the cables, to the ſeparated parts of the ſhroud, which are thereby reunited, ſo as to be fit for immediate ſervice. This, however, is only a temporary expedient.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
