<p><span class="font1">the growing power of the pope, could not exist without him, respected his moral authority, but considered that he usurped&nbsp;undue power in Rome. This was specially the feeling of the&nbsp;nobles, who had hitherto held the chief authority in the republic,&nbsp;and, being still the leaders of the army, were by no means&nbsp;willing to relinquish it. The Roman nobles were very different&nbsp;from other aristocratic bodies elsewhere. They were not as&nbsp;they pretended, descendants of the Camilli and the Scipios,&nbsp;but neither were they a feudal aristocracy, inasmuch as the&nbsp;Teutonic element had as yet made small way among them.&nbsp;They were a mixture of different elements, national and foreign,&nbsp;formed by the special conditions of Rome. Their power was&nbsp;chiefly derived from the high offices and large grants of money&nbsp;and land conferred on them by the popes; but, as no dynasty&nbsp;existed, they could not be dynastic. Every pope aggrandized&nbsp;his own kindred and friends, and these were the natural and&nbsp;often open adversaries of the next pontiff and his favourites.&nbsp;Thus the Roman nobility was powerful, divided, restless and&nbsp;turbulent; it was continually plotting against the pope,&nbsp;threatening not only his power, but even his life; it continually&nbsp;appealed to the people for assistance, stirred the militia to&nbsp;revolt and rendered government an impossibility. Hence,&nbsp;notwithstanding his immense moral authority, the pope was&nbsp;the effective head neither of the aristocracy, the army nor of&nbsp;the as yet unorganized lower classes. The lord of vast but&nbsp;often insubordinate territories, the recognized master of a&nbsp;capital city torn by internecine feud and plots against himself,&nbsp;he needed the support of an effective force for his own preservation and the maintenance of the authority proffered him from&nbsp;all quarters. Hence the necessity of creating an empire of the&nbsp;West, after having snapped every link with that of the East.&nbsp;Thus the history of Rome is still, as in the past, a history of&nbsp;continual strife between pope, emperor and republic; and the&nbsp;city, while imbibing strength from all three, keeps them in&nbsp;perpetual tumult and confusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Leo III. (796-816) further strengthened the ties between Charlemagne and the church by sending the former a letter&nbsp;with the keys of the shrine of St Peter and the banner of&nbsp;Rome. Charlemagne had already joined to his office of&nbsp;patrician the function of high justice. The new symbols now&nbsp;sent constituted him </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">miles</span><span class="font1"> of Rome and general of the church.&nbsp;The pope urged him to despatch an envoy to receive the oath&nbsp;of fealty, thus placing himself, the representative of the republic,&nbsp;in the subordinate position of one of the bishops who had&nbsp;received the immunities of counts. And all these arrangements&nbsp;took place without the slightest reference to the senate, the&nbsp;army or the people. Much resentment was felt, especially&nbsp;by the nobles, and a revolution ensued headed by the&nbsp;Paschalis and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">secundicerius</span><span class="font1"> Campulus, and&nbsp;backed by all who wished to liberate the city from the papal&nbsp;rule. During a solemn procession the pope was attacked and&nbsp;barbarously maltreated by his assailants, who tried to tear&nbsp;out his eyes and tongue (799). He was thrown into prison,&nbsp;escaped and overtook Charlemagne at Paderborn, and&nbsp;returned guarded by ten of the monarch’s envoys, who condemned to death the leaders of the revolt, reserving, however,&nbsp;to their sovereign the right of final judgment. Charlemagne&nbsp;arrived in December 800, and as high justice assembled a&nbsp;tribunal of. the clergy, nobles, citizens and Franks; he pronounced Leo to be innocent, and confirmed the capital sentence&nbsp;passed on the rebels. But through the intercession of the&nbsp;pope, who dreaded the wrath of the nobles, this was presently&nbsp;commuted into perpetual exile. And finally on&nbsp;Christmas day, in St Peter’s, before an assemblage&nbsp;of Roman and Frankish lords, the clergy and the&nbsp;people, the pontiff placed the imperial crown on</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Charlemagne’s head and all proclaimed him emperor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thus the new emperor was elected by the Romans and consecrated by the pope. But he was their real master and&nbsp;supreme judge. The pope existed only by his will, since he&nbsp;alone supplied the means for the maintenance of the temporal&nbsp;power, and already pretended to the right of controlling the&nbsp;papal elections. Yet Charlemagne was not sovereign of&nbsp;Rome; he possessed scarcely any regalia there, and was not&nbsp;in command of the army; he mainly represented a principle,&nbsp;but this principle was the law which is the basis of the state.&nbsp;The pope still nominated the Roman judges, but the emperor&nbsp;or his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">missi</span><span class="font1"> presided over them, together with those of the&nbsp;pope, and his decision was appealed to in last resort. During&nbsp;the Carolingian times no mention is found of the prefect, and&nbsp;it would seem that his office was filled by the imperial </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">missus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or legate, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judices de clero</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judices de militia.</span><span class="font1"> The power&nbsp;of the pope was now entangled with that of the republic on&nbsp;the one hand and that of the empire on the other. The consequent confusion of sacred and secular functions naturally&nbsp;led to infinite complications and disputes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The death of Charlemagne in 814 was the signal for a fresh conspiracy of the nobles against the pope, who, discovering&nbsp;their design, instantly put the ringleaders to death, and was&nbsp;severely blamed by Louis for this violation of the imperial&nbsp;prerogative. While the matter was under discussion the&nbsp;nobles broke out in fiercer tumults, both in Rome and the&nbsp;Campagna. At last, in 824, the emperor Lothair came to reestablish order in Rome, and proclaimed a new and noteworthy constitution, to which Pope Eugcnius </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">11. </span><span class="font1">(824-27)&nbsp;gave his oath of adherence. By this the partnership of pope&nbsp;and emperor in the temporal rule of Rome and the states&nbsp;of the church was again confirmed. The more direct power&nbsp;appertained to the pope; the supreme authority, presidence&nbsp;of the tribunals, and final judgment on appeal to the emperor.&nbsp;The new constitution also established the right of contending&nbsp;parties to select either the Roman or the Teutonic code for&nbsp;the settlement of their disputes.- During the Carolingian&nbsp;period it is not surprising that the commune should have been,&nbsp;as it were, absorbed by the church and the empire. In fact,&nbsp;it is scarcely mentioned in history throughout that time.&nbsp;And when, no longer sustained by the genius of its&nbsp;founder, the Frankish empire began to show signs&nbsp;of dissolution, the popes, finding their power thereby&nbsp;strengthened, began to assume many of the imperial attributes. Soon, however, as a natural consequence of the&nbsp;loss of the main support of the papacy, the nobles regained&nbsp;vigour and were once more masters of the city. Teutonic and&nbsp;feudal elements had now largely penetrated into their organization. The system of granting lands, and even churches and&nbsp;convents, as benefices according to feudal forms, became more&nbsp;and more general. It was vain for the popes to offer opposition,&nbsp;and they ended by yielding to the current. The fall of the&nbsp;Frankish empire left all Italy a prey to anarchy, and tom by&nbsp;the faction fights of Berengar of Friuli and Guido of Spoleto,&nbsp;the rival claimants to the crowns of Italy and the empire. The&nbsp;Saracens were advancing from the south, the Huns from&nbsp;the north; the popes had lost all power; and in the midst&nbsp;of this frightful chaos a way was opened for the rise of the&nbsp;republics. Anarchy was at its climax in Rome, but the laity&nbsp;began to overpower the clergy to such an extent that the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judices de militia</span><span class="font1"> prevailed over the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judices de clero.</span><span class="font1"> For a&nbsp;long time no imperial </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">missi</span><span class="font1"> or legates had been seen, and the&nbsp;papacy was incredibly lowered. The election of the popes&nbsp;had positively fallen into the hands of certain beautiful women&nbsp;notorious for their evil life and depravity. The&nbsp;aristocracy alone gained strength; now freed from&nbsp;the domination of the emperor, it continually wrested&nbsp;fresh privileges from the impotent pontiffs, and&nbsp;became organized as the ruling force of the republic.&nbsp;Gregorovius, notwithstanding his denial of the continuation of&nbsp;the senate after the 6th century, is obliged to acknowledge&nbsp;that it appeared to have returned to life in the power of this&nbsp;new baronage. And, although this body was now permeated&nbsp;with the feudal principle, it did not discard its ancient traditions.&nbsp;The nobles claimed to be the main source of the empire; they&nbsp;wished to regain the dignity and office of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patricius,</span><span class="font1"> and to&nbsp;make it, if possible, hereditary in some of their families.&nbsp;Nothing is known of their system of organization, but it seems</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
