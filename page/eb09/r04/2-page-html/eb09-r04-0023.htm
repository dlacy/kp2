        <p><span class="font1">1,422,012 males; but this category is now disappearing in consequence
                of a recent law (December 28, 1881).</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The allotments could be redeemed by the peasants with the help of the
                crown, and then the peasants were freed from all obligations to the landlord. The
                crown paid the landlord in obligations&nbsp;representing the capitalized “ obrok, ”
                and the peasants had to pay&nbsp;the crown, for forty-nine years, 6 per cent.
                interest on this capital,&nbsp;that is, 9 to 12 roubles per allotment. If the
                redemption was&nbsp;made without the consent of the peasants—on a mere demand
                of&nbsp;the landlord, or in consequence of his being in arrear for the payment of
                his debts to the nobility hypothec bank—the value of&nbsp;the redemption was reduced
                by one-fifth. The redemption was&nbsp;not calculated on the value of the allotments,
                but was considered&nbsp;as a compensation for the loss of the compulsory labour of
                the&nbsp;serfs ; so that throughout Russia, with the exception of a few provinces in
                the south-east, it was—and still remains notwithstanding&nbsp;a very great increase
                of the value of land—much higher than the&nbsp;market value of the allotment.
                Moreover, taking advantage of&nbsp;the maximum law, many proprietors cut away large
                parts of the&nbsp;allotments the peasants possessed under serfdom, and
                precisely&nbsp;the parts the peasants were most in need of, namely,
                pasture&nbsp;lands around their houses, and forests. On the whole, the&nbsp;tendency
                was to give the allotments so as to deprive the peasants&nbsp;of grazing land and
                thus to compel them to rent pasture lands&nbsp;from the landlord at any
                price.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The present condition of the peasants—according to official
                documents—appears to be as follows. In the twelve central governments the peasants,
                on the average, have their own rye-bread for only&nbsp;200 days per year,—often for
                only 180 and 100 days. One quarter&nbsp;of them have received allotments of only 2
                    <sup>-</sup>9 acres per male, and&nbsp;one half less than 8<sup>,</sup>5 to 11'4
                acres,—the normal size of the&nbsp;allotment necessary to the subsistence of a
                family under the three-fields system being estimated at 28 to 42 acres. Land must
                be&nbsp;thus rented from the landlords at fabulous prices. Cattle-breeding&nbsp;is
                diminishing to an alarming degree. The average redemption is&nbsp;8<sup>-</sup>56
                roubles (about 17s.) for such allotments, and the smaller the&nbsp;allotment the
                heavier the payment, its first “dessiatina” (2<sup>-</sup>S6&nbsp;acres) costing
                twice as much as the second, and four times as much&nbsp;as the third. In all these
                governments, the state commission&nbsp;testifies, there are whole districts where
                one-third of the peasants&nbsp;have received allotments of only 2<sup>,</sup>9 to 5
                    <sup>-</sup>8 acres. The aggregate&nbsp;value of the redemption and land-taxes
                often reaches from 185&nbsp;to 275 per cent, of the normal rental value of the
                allotments, not&nbsp;to speak of taxes for recruiting purposes, the church, roads,
                local&nbsp;administration, and so on, chiefly levied from peasants. The&nbsp;arrears
                increase every year ; one-fifth of the inhabitants have left&nbsp;their houses ;
                cattle are disappearing. Every year more than half&nbsp;the adult males (in some
                districts three-fourths of the men and&nbsp;one-third of the women) leave their
                homes and wander throughout&nbsp;Russia in search of labour. The state peasants are
                only a little&nbsp;better off.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Such is the state of affairs in central Russia, and it would be
                useless to multiply figures, repeating nearly the same details. In the eight
                governments of the black-earth region the state of matters is&nbsp;hardly better.
                Many peasants took the “ gratuitous allotments, ”&nbsp;whose amount was about
                one-eighth of the normal ones.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The average allotment in Kherson is now only 0<sup>-</sup>90 acre,
                and for allotments from 2'9 to 5'8 acres they pay from 5 to 10 roubles&nbsp;of
                redemption tax. The state peasants are better off, but still&nbsp;they are
                emigrating in masses. It is only in the Steppe governments that the situation is
                more hopeful. In Little Russia, where&nbsp;the allotments were personal (the
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mir</span><span class="font1">
                existing only among state&nbsp;peasants), the state of affairs does not differ for
                the better on&nbsp;account of the high redemption taxes. In the western
                provinces,&nbsp;where the land was valued cheaper and the allotments
                somewhat&nbsp;increased after the Polish insurrection, the general situation
                might&nbsp;be better were it not for the former misery of peasants. Finally,&nbsp;in
                the Baltic provinces nearly all the land belongs to German&nbsp;landlords, who
                either carry on agriculture themselves, with hired&nbsp;labourers, or rent their
                land as small farms. Only one-fourth of&nbsp;the peasants are farmers, the remainder
                being mere labourers, who&nbsp;are emigrating in great numbers.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The situation of the former serf-proprietors is also unsatisfactory.
                Accustomed to the use of compulsory labour, they have failed to&nbsp;accommodate
                themselves to the new conditions. The 700,000,000&nbsp;roubles of redemption money
                received from the crown down to 1877&nbsp;by 71,000 landed proprietors in Russia
                have been spent without&nbsp;accomplishing any agricultural improvement. The forests
                have&nbsp;been sold, and only those landlords are prospering who exact rack-rents
                for the land without which the peasants could not live upon&nbsp;their
                allotments.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">As showing a better aspect of the situation it must be added that in
                eighty-five districts of Russia the peasants have bought&nbsp;5,349,000 acres of
                land since 1861. But these are mostly village-traders and grain-lenders (kulaks). A
                real exception can be made&nbsp;only for Tver, where 53,474 householders united in
                communities&nbsp;have bought 633,240 acres of land. There has been an increase
                of&nbsp;wealth among the few, but along with this a general impoverishment of the
                mass of the people. @@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The ancient Scandinavians described Russia as Gardariki,—the country
                of towns,—and until now Great Russia has maintained&nbsp;this character. The
                dwellings of the peasantry are not scattered&nbsp;over the face of the country, but
                aggregated in villages, where they&nbsp;are built in a street or streets. This
                grouping in villages has its&nbsp;origin in the bonds which unite the peasants in
                the village community—the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >mir,</span><span class="font1"> or the o</span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">bshchina.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">When Haxthausen first described the Great Russian mir, it was
                considered a peculiarity of the Slavonian race,—a view which is&nbsp;no longer
                tenable. The mir is the Great Russian equivalent for&nbsp;the German, Dutch, and
                Swiss “mark” or “allmend,” the English&nbsp;“township,” the French “commune,” the
                Polish “gmina,” the&nbsp;South Slavonian “zadruga,” the Finnish “pittayä,” &amp;c. ;
                and it&nbsp;very nearly approaches, though differing from them in some essential
                features, the forms of possession of land prevailing among the&nbsp;Moslem
                Turco-Tartars, while the same principle is found even&nbsp;among the Mongol Buriat
                shepherds and the Tungus hunters.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The following are the leading features of the organization of the mir
                among the Great Russians.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The whole of the land occupied by a village—whoever be the landlord
                recognized by law—the state, a private person, or a&nbsp;juridical unity, such as
                the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">voisko</span><span
                class="font1"> of the Cossacks—is considered&nbsp;as belonging to the village
                community as a whole, the separate&nbsp;members of the community having only the
                right of temporary&nbsp;possession of such part of the common property as will be
                allowed&nbsp;to them by the mir in proportion to their working power. To&nbsp;this
                right corresponds the obligation of bearing an adequate part&nbsp;of the charges
                which may fall upon the community. If any&nbsp;produce results from the common work
                of the community, each&nbsp;member has a right to an equal part of it.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">According to these general principles, the arable land is divided
                into as many lots as there are working units in the community,&nbsp;and each family
                receives as many lots as it has working units. The&nbsp;unit is usually one male
                adult ; but, when the working power of&nbsp;a large family is increased by its
                containing a number of adult&nbsp;women, or boys approaching adult age, this
                circumstance is taken&nbsp;into account, as well as the diminution from any cause of
                working&nbsp;power in other households.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">For dividing the arable land into lots, the whole is parted first
                into three “fields,” according to the three-field rotation of crops.&nbsp;As each
                field, however, contains land of various qualities, it is in&nbsp;its turn
                subdivided into, say, three parts—of good, average, and&nbsp;poor quality ; and each
                of these parts is subdivided into as many&nbsp;lots as there are working units. Each
                household receives its lots&nbsp;in each of the subdivisions of the “field,” a
                carefully minute&nbsp;equalization as to the minor differences between the lots
                being&nbsp;aimed at ; and the partition is nearly always made so as to
                permit&nbsp;each householder to reach his allotment without passing
                through&nbsp;that of another.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">To facilitate this division, the community divides, first, into
                smaller groups </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(vyt,
                Zhxrebyevka,</span><span class="font1"> a “ten,” an “ eight,” &amp;c.), each
                of&nbsp;which is composed, by free selection, of a number of householders&nbsp;—the
                community only taking care that each shall not be composed&nbsp;of rich, of poor, or
                of “ turbulents ” exclusively. The division of&nbsp;the land is first made among
                such groups, and the subdivision goes&nbsp;on within these. The division into groups
                facilitates also the distribution of such work as the community may have to
                accomplish—&nbsp;as when a bridge or a ditch has to be repaired, or a meadow
                mowed&nbsp;—and the work cannot be done by the community as a whole.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">As sickness, death, removal, and other incidents bring about changes
                in the distribution of working power among the different&nbsp;households, or when
                the number of working units in the community has increased or decreased, a
                redistribution of land&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >(peredyel)</span><span class="font1"> follows. Whether the land be a burden (the
                taxes&nbsp;exceeding its rental value) or a benefit, its division is equalized
                ;&nbsp;the households whose working power has increased receive additional lots, and
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">vice versa.</span><span
                class="font1"> The peredyel may be “partial” or&nbsp;“general.” In most cases a mere
                equalization of lots among&nbsp;several families will serve, and a general
                redistribution is resorted&nbsp;to only when greater inequalities have arisen. On
                the whole,&nbsp;these redistributions are rare, and the precariousness of
                land-holding which has been supposed to be a consequence of the mir&nbsp;proves to
                have been exaggerated. More detailed inquiries have</span></p>
