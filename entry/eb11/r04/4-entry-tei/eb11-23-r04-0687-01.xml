                    <label>ROMNEY, HENRY SIDNEY</label>, <hi rend="smallcaps">Earl of</hi>
                    (1641-1704), fourth son of Robert, 2nd earl of Leicester, was born in Paris in
                    1641. He and his nephew, Robert Spencer, afterwards 2nd earl of Sunderland, his
                    senior by a few months, were sent to travel on the continent of Europe in charge
                    of a Calvinist divine, Dr Thomas Pierce. Sidney’s handsome face helped his
                    advancement at court, but the favour in which he was held by the duchess of
                    York, to whom he was master of the robes, led to his dismissal in 1666. His
                    disgrace, however, was short-lived. He was promoted captain in 1667, and colonel
                    in 1678. In 1672 he was sent on a mission of congratulation to Louis XIV., and
                    in 1677 became master of the robes to Charles II. He entered parliament as
                    member for Bramber in 1679, and became a close political ally of his nephew
                    Sunderland, with whose wife he carried on an intrigue which caused considerable
                    scandal. Sunderland made this intimacy a means to further his political ends,
                    while Sidney’s social reputation and his apparent frivolity partly concealed his
                    real capacity for intrigue. Sidney was sent by Sunderland and others in 1679 on
                    a special mission to urge William of Orange to visit England, a task that he was
                    able to discharge while acting as the official envoy of Charles II. at the
                    Hague. He was recalled in 1682, but was again sent on a special mission to
                    Holland in the year of the accession of James II. He returned to England in the
                    spring of 1688, and set to work, at William’s desire, to obtain promises of
                    support for the prince of Orange in the event of his landing. He was presently
                    allowed to leave England on giving his word not to visit the</p>

                <p>Hague, but he broke his promise on getting clear of England, and conveyed to
                    William a duplicate of the invitation addressed to him by the English nobility,
                    together with intelligence of affairs of state obtained through the countess of
                    Sunderland. He landed with William at Torbay, and received substantial rewards
                    for his undoubted services. Sworn of the privy council in 1689, Sidney was made
                    gentleman of the bedchamber and colonel of the king’s regiment of footguards,
                    and received the titles of Baron Milton and Viscount Sidney of Sheppey. In 1690
                    he received considerable grants of land from the confiscated estates of the
                    Irish supporters of James II., much of which he lost, however, on the
                    parliamentary investigation in 1699 into the distribution of the Irish lands.
                    William made him secretary of state in 1690, pending the discovery of a better
                    person. He was soon asked to resign, but was compensated by his appointment, in
                    1692, as lord-lieutenant of Ireland. His inability to cope with the difficulties
                    of this position led to his recall in the next year, when he became
                    master-general of the ordnance. He was created earl of Romney in May 1694, and
                    he retained William’s confidence to the last, but on Anne’s accession he was
                    dismissed from his various offices. He never married, and his titles became
                    extinct on his death on the 8th of April 1704.</p>
                <p>In 1801 the title of earl of Romney was revived in the family of Marsham. Sir
                    Robert Marsham, Bart. (1685-1724), of Cuxton in Kent, was a member of parliament
                    from 1708 to 1716, when he was created Baron of Romney. His grandson Charles,
                    the 3rd Baron (1774-1811), was created earl of Romney in 1801, and from him the
                    present earl is descended.</p>
