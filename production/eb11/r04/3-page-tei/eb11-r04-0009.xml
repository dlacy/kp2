No doubt there is a good deal of myth attached to the name of Servius, who seems to have been regarded by later Romans as a popular monarch, like Alfred by the English, but the main features of the traditional account of the constitutional reforms of this period may be taken as based on fair presumptive evidence. That all of them indeed were evolved from one brain is hardly credible, and that some of them were in observance <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>  before being made constitutionally binding is very likely.</p><p>The design attributed to Servius was that of altering the old constitution in order to promote an advance tovzards equality between patricians and plebeians. He is credited with having desired, on the one hand, to ameliorate the position of the <hi rend="italic">plebs</hi>  and, on the other, to make them bear a proportionate share of the burdens of the state—in particular, to serve in the army and contribute to the war tax <hi rend="italic">{tributum).</hi>  He effected this by giving them qualified rights of citizenship, not indeed by admitting them into the gentile organizations, but by creating a new political assembly of a distinctly military character in which they as well as the gentiles could take part. The so-called Servian reforms may be roughly summarized under the following four heads, viz. (i) a division of the Roman territory within the city walls into four local wards called <hi rend="italic">tribus</hi>  (to which a number of tribes outside the city—<hi rend="italic">tribus rusticae—</hi>were afterwards in course of time added); (2) the establishment of a register of the citizens <hi rend="italic">{census)</hi>  which was to contain, in addition to a record of the strength of their families, a statement of the value of their lands, with the slaves and cattle employed in their cultivation, and which was to be revised periodically; (3) a division of the people, as appearing in the census, into five classes for military purposes, determined by the value of their holdings in land and its appurtenances, with a subdivision of each class into so-called <hi rend="italic">centuriae;</hi>  (4) the creation of a new assembly with legislative power called <hi rend="italic">comitia centuriata,</hi>  in which the vote was to be taken by <hi rend="italic">centuriae. </hi>While it may be an open question how far these reforms, and particularly the institution of the centuriate comitia, were actually due to Servius, or only a result of his arrangements, the whole conception of the new constitution is obviously of early date and indicative of considerable statesmanship.</p><p>The plebeians were thereby made constitutionally part of the <hi rend="italic">populus Romanus;</hi>  they became citizens <hi rend="italic">{Quirites).</hi>@@<hi rend="italic"/>They got <hi rend="italic">commercium</hi>  and also <hi rend="italic">connubium</hi>  so far that their marriages <hi rend="italic">inter se</hi>  were recognized as legal marriages. Rights and duties were so tar to be measured by each citizen s position as a holder of lands; the amount of land (including slaves and cattle appurtenant thereto)@@  held by him on quintarían title was to determine the nature of the military service he was to render, the tribute he was to pay, and his right to take part in the new political assembly. It is indeed probable that a good while before Servius the conception of individual ownership of lands and things necessary for their cultivation had been reached, and that such ownership was recognized not only among the gentiles, but also<hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>  even more largely among the plebeians. The common lands of the <hi rend="italic">gentes</hi>  had become split up, to a considerable extent, among families and individuals. However this be, the creation of the <hi rend="italic">census</hi>  ensured, as far as possible, certainty of title, as it was declared that no transfers of property enrolled in it would be recognized unless made by public con-veyance with observance of certain prescribed formalities.@@ The form of conveyance thus legally sanctioned was called originally<hi rend="italic">mancupium,</hi>  afterwards <hi rend="italic">mancipium,</hi>  and at a still later period <hi rend="italic">mancipatio,</hi>  while the lands and other things that were to pass by it came to be known as <hi rend="italic">res mancipii</hi>  (or <hi rend="italic">mancipi). </hi>Hence arose a distinction of great importance in the law of property (which lasted till Justinian formally abolished it), between <hi rend="italic">res mancipi</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">res nec mancipi;</hi>  the former being transferable only by mancipation or surrender in court, the latter by simple delivery (see <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>, p. 541).</p><p>iii. <hi rend="italic">Institutions of the Private Law.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Law of the Family.</hi>@@<hi rend="italic"/>The word <hi rend="italic">familia</hi>  iá Roman law had at once a more extensive and a more limited meaning than it has in its English form. Husband, wife and <hi rend="italic">Tbe </hi>children did not necessarily constitute an independ- <hi rend="bold"><hi rend="italic">patrician </hi></hi>ent family among the Romans, as with us, nor were they all necessarily of the same one.

He might have a whole host dependent on him, wife and sons and daughters, and daughters-in-law and grandchildren by his sons, and possibly remoter descendants related through males; so long as they remained subject to him they constituted but one family, that was split up only on his death or loss of citizenship. But if his wife bad not passed <hi rend="italic">in manum</hi>  (a result apparently unknown among the patricians at this period), she did not become a member of his family: she remained a member of the family in which she was born, or, if its head were deceased or she had been emancipated, she constituted a family in her own person.
