Afterwards he had ſeveral conferences with Fabric!us, whoſe virtue he had tried with mighty offers of riches and grandeur ; but finding him proof againſt ail temptations, he reſolved to try whether his intrepidity and courage were equal to his virtue. With this view, he cauſed an elephant to be placed behind a curtain ih the halΓwhere he received the Roman ambaſſador. As Fa-bricius had never ſeen one of thoſe beaſts, the king, taking a turn or two in the hall with him, brought him within the elephant’s reach, and then cauſed the curtain to be drawn all on a ſudden, and that monſtrous animal to make his uſual noiſe, and even lay his trunk on Fabricius’s head. But thé intrepid Roman, without betraying the leaſt fear or concern, “ Does the great king (laid he, with ſurpriſing calmneſs), who could not ſtagger me with his offers, think to frighten me with the braying of a beaſt ?” Pyrrhus, aſtoniſhed at his immoveable conſtancy, invited him to dine with him ; and on this occaſion it was, that the converſation turning upon Epicurean philoſophy, Fabrſeius made that celebrated exclamation, “ O that Pyrrhus, both for Rome’s ſake and his own, had placed his happineſs in the boaſted indolence of Epicurus.”</p><p>Every thing Pyrrhus heard or ſaw of the Romans increaſed his earneſtneſs for peace. He ſent for the three ambaſſadors, releaſed 200 of the priſoners without ranſom, and ſuffered the reſt, on their parole, to return to Rome to celebrate the Saturnalia, or feaſts of Saturn, in their own families. Having by this obliging behaviour gained the good-will of the Roman ambaſſadors, he ſent Cyneas to Rome, almoſt at the ſame time that they left Tarentum. The inſtructions he gave this faithful miniſter, were, to bring the Romans to grant theſe three articles ; 1. That the Tarentines ſhould be included in the treaty made with the king of Epirus. 2. That the Greek cities in Italy ſhould be ſuffered to enjoy their laws and liberties. 3. That the republic ſhould reſtore to the Samnites, Lucanians, and BrUttians, all the places ſhe had taken from them. Upon theſe conditions, Pyrrhus declared himſelf ready to forbear all further hoſtilities, and conclude a laſting peace. With theſe inſtructions Cyneas ſet out for Rome } where, partly by his eloquence, partly by rich preſents to the ſenators and their wives, he ſoon gained a good number of voices. When he was admitted into the ſenate, he made an harangue worthy of a diſciple of the great Demoſt-henes ; after which, he read the conditions Pyrrhus propoſed, and, with a great deal of eloquence, endeavouring to ſhow the reaſonableneſs and moderation of his mailer’s demands, aſhed leave ſor Pyrrhus to come to Rome to conclude and ſign the treaty. The ſenators were generally inclined to agree to Pyrrhus’s terms ; but nevertheleſs, as ſeveral ſenators were abſent, the determination of the affair was poſtponed to the next day ; when Appius Claudius, the greateſt orator and moſt learned civilian in Rome, old and blind as he was, cauſed himſelf to be carried to the ſenate, where he had not appeared for many years ; and there, partly by his eloquence, partly by his authority, ſo prepoſſeſſed the minds of the ſenators againſt the king of Epirus, and the conditions he offered, that, when he had done ſpeaking, the conſcript fathers unanimouſiy paſſed a decree, the ſubſtance of which was, That the war with Pyrrhus ſhould be continued ; that his ambaſtador ſhould be ſent back that very day ; that the king of Epirus ſhould not be permitted to come to Rome ; and that they ſhould acquaint his ambaſſador, that Rome would enter into no treaty of peace with his maſter till lie had left Italy.</p><p>Cyneas, ſurpriſed at the anſwer given him, left Rome the ſaftie day, and returned to Tarentum, to acquaint the king with the final reſolution of the ſenate. Pyrrhus Would have willingly concluded a peace with them upon honourable terms ; but, as the conditions they offered were not by any means conſiſtent with the reputation of his arms, he began, without loſs of time, to make all due preparations for the next campaign. On the other hand, the Romans having raiſed to the conſulate P. Sulpſeius 8averrio, and P. Decius Mus, diſpatched them both into Apulia, where they found Pyrrhus encamped near a little town called <hi rend="italic">Aſculum.</hi>  There the conſuls, joining their armies, fortified themſelves at the foot of the Apennines, having between them and the enemy a large deep ſtream which divided the plain. Both armies continued a great while on the oppoſite banks, before either ventured to paſs over to attack the Other. The Epirots allowed the Romans to croſs the ſtream, and draw up on the plain. On the other hand, Pyrrhus placed his men likewiſe in order of battle in the ſame plain ; and all the ancients do him the juſtice to ſay, that no commander ever underſtood better the art of drawing up an army and directing its motions. In the right wing he placed his Epirots and the Samnites ; in his left the Lucanians, Bruttians and Salentines ; and liis phalanx in the centre. The centre of the Roman army conſiſted of four legions, which were to engage the enemy’s phalanx ; on their wings were poſted the light-armed auxiliaries and the Roman horſe. The conſuls, in order to guard their troops againſt the fury of the elephants had prepared chariots, armed with long points of iron in the ſhape of forks, and filled with ſoldiers carrying firebrands, which they were directed to throw at the elephants, and by that means frighten them, and ſet their wooden towers on fire. Theſe chariots were poſted over-againſt the king’s elephants, and ordered not to ſtir till they entered upon action. To this precaution the Roman generals added another, which was, to direct a body of Apulians to attack Pyrthus’s camp in the heat of the engagement, in order to force it, or at leaſt to draw off part of the enemy’s troops to defend it. At length the attack began, both parties being pretty equal in number ; for each of them conſiſted of about 40,000 men. The phalanx ſuſtained, for a long time, the furious onſet of the legions with incredible bravery : but at length being forced to give way, Pyrrhus commanded his elephants to advance, but not on the ſide where the Romans had poſted their chariots ; they marched round, and, falling upon the Roman horſe, ſoon put them into confuſion. Then the phalanx, returning with freſh courage to the charge, made the Roman legions in their turn give ground. On this occaſion Decius was killed, ſo that one conſul only was leſt to command the two Roman armies. But while all things ſeemed to favour Pyrrhus, the body of Apulians which we have mentioned above, falling unexpectedly on the camp of the Epirots, obliged the king to di-ſpatch a ſtrong detachment to defend his intrenchments.</p></body></text></TEI>
