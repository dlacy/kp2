As thefe ſhips were commanded by their braveſt ſea-officers, they ſoon returned with an 'immenſe booty, and a great many priſoners. Among ■other veffels, they took a galley richly laden, on board of which they ſound a great variety of valuable ſurni-ture, and a royal robe, which Phila herſelf had wrought and ſent as a preſent to her huſhand Demetrius, accompanied with a letter written with her own hand. The Rhodians ſent the furniture, the royal robe, and even the letter, to Ptolemy ; which exaſperated Deme-trius to a great degree.</p><p>while Demetrius was preparing to attack the city, the Rhodians having affembled the people and magiſtrates to conſult about the meaſures they ſhould take, ſome propoſed in the affembly tbe pulling down of tlie ſtatues of Antigonus and his ſon Demetrius, wliich till then had been held in the utmoſt veneration. But this propoſal was generally rejected with indignation, and their prudent conduct greatly allayed the wrath both of Antigonus and Demetrius. However, the latter continued to carry on the ſiege with the utmoſt vigour, thinking it would reflect no ſmall diſhonour on him were he obliged, to quit the place without making himſelf maſter of it. He cauſed the walls to be ſecretly undermined : but, when they were ready to ſall, a deſcrter very opportunely gave notice of the whole to the townſmen ; who haviag, with all expedition, drawn a deep trench all along the wall, began to countermine, and, meeting the enemy under ground, obliged them to abandon the work, while both parties guarded the mines, one Athenagoras a Mileſian, who had been ſent to the affiſtance of the Rhodians by Ptolemy with a body of mercenaries, promiſed to betray the city to the Demetrians, and let them in thro’ the mines in the night-time. But- this was only in order to enſnare them ; for Alexander, a noble Ma-cedonian, whom Demetrius had ſent with a choice body of troops to take poffeffion of a poſt agreed on, no ſooner appeared, but he was taken priſoner by the Rhodians, who were waiting for him under arms. — Athenagoras was crowned by the ſenate with a crown of gold, and preſented with ſive talents of ſilver.</p><p>Demetrius now gave over all thoughts of undermining the walls, and placed all his hopes of reducing the city in the battering-engines which he had contrived. Having therefore levelled the ground under the walls, he brought up his helepolis, with four teſtudoes on each ſide of it. Two other teſtudoes of an extraordinary ſize, bearing battering-rams, were like-wife moved forwards by 1000 men. Each ſtory of the helepolis was ſilled with all ſorts of engines for diſcharging of ſtones, arrows, and darts, when all things were ready, Demetrius ordered the ſignal to be given ; when his men, ſetting up a ſhout, affaulted the city on all ſides both by ſea and land. But, in the heat of the attack, when the walls were ready to fall by the repeated ſtrokes of the battering-rams, am baſſadors arrived from Cnidus, earneſtly ſolicſting Demetrius to fuſpend all further hoſtilities, and at the fame time giving him hopes that they ſhould prevail upon the Rhodians to ſubmit to an honourable capitulation. A fuſpenfipn of arms was accordingly agreed on, and ambaſſadors fent from both ſſdes. But the Rhodians refaſmg to capitulate on the conditions Offered them, the attack was renewed with ſo much fury, and the machines played off in ſo briſk a manner, that a large tower built with ſquare ſtones, and the wall that flanked it, were battered down. The beſie-ged, nevertheleſs, fought in the breach with fo much courage and reſolution, that the enemy, after various unſucceſsſul attempts, were forced to abandon the en-tepriſe, and retire.</p><p>In this conjuncture, a fleet which Ptolemy had freighted with 300,000 meaſures of corn, and different kinds of pulſe for thc ufe of the Rhodians, ar-rived very ſeaſonably in the port, nothwithſtandiug the vigilance of the enemy’s ſhips, which cruized on the coaſts of the iſſand to ſurpriſe them. A few days after came in fafe two other fleets, one ſent by Caf-ſander, with 100,000 buſhels of barley; the other by Lyſimachus, with 400,000 buſhcts of corn and as many oſ barley. This ſeaſonable and plentiful ſupply arriving when the city began to ſuffer for want of proviſions, inſpired the beſieged with new courage, and raiſed their drooping ſpirits. Being thus animated, they formed a deſign of ſetting the enemy’s engines on ſire ; and with this view ordered a body of men to ſally out the night enſuing, about the ſecond watch, with torches and ſirebrands, having ſirſt placed on the walls an incredible number of engines, to diſcharge ſtones, arrows, darts, and fire-balls, againſt thoſe who ſhould attempt to oppoſe their detachment. The Rhodian troops, purſuant to their orders, all on a ſudden fallied out, and advancing, in ſpite of all oppoſition, to the batteries, ſet them on ſire, while the engines from the walla played inceffantly on thoſe who endeavoured to extinguiſh the flames. The Demetrians on this occaſion fell in great numbers, being incapable, in the darknefs of the -night, either to ſee the engines that continually difeharged ſhowers of ſtones and arrows upon them, or to join in one body and repulſe the enemy. The conflagration was ſo great, that ſeveral plates of iron falling from the helepolis, that vaſt engine would have been entirely conſumed, had not the troops that were ſtationed in it with all poffible fpeed quenched the fire with water, before prepared, and ready in the apart-ments of the engine againſt ſueh accidents. Deme-trius, fearing leſt all his machines ſhould be conſumed, called together, by ſound of trumpet, thoſe whoſe province it was to move them ; and, by their help, brought them off before they were entirely deſtroyed. When it was day, he commanded all the darts and arrows that had been ſhot by the Rhodians to be carefully gathered, that he might from their number form ſome judgement of the number of machines in the city. Above 800 firebrands were found on the fpot, and no fewer than 1500 darts, all diſcharged in a very ſmall portion of the night. This ſtruck the prince himſelf with no ſmall terror ; for he never imagined that they would have been able to bear the charges of ſuch formidable preparations. However, after having cauſed the ſſain to be buried, and given directions for the curing of the wounded, he applied himſelf to the repairing of his machines, which had bccn diſmounted and rendered ■quite unſerviceable.</p><p>In the mean time, the 'beſieged, improving the reſpite allowed them by the removal of the machines, built a third wall in the form of a crefcent, which took in all that part that was moſt expoſed to the enemy s batteries ; and, beſides, drew a deep trench behind the</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
