                <p><label>RUFFHEAD</label> (Dr Owen), was the ſon of his Majeſty’s baker, in
                    Piccadilly ; who buying a lottery ticket for him in his infancy, which happened
                    to be drawn a prize of 500l. this ſum was applied to educate him for the law. He
                    accordingly entered in the Middle Temple ; and ſeconded fo well the views of his
                    father, ſhat he became a good ſeholar and an acute barriſter. While he was
                    waiting for opportunities to diſtinguiſh himſelf in ids proſeſſion, he wrote a
                    variety of pamphlets on temporary politics ; and was afterwards diſtinguiſhed by
                    his accurate edition of <hi rend="italic">The Statutes at Large,</hi> in 4t0.
                    He now obtained good bufineſs, though more as a chamber-counſellor in framing
                    bills for parliament than as a pleader ; but his cloſe application to ſtudy,
                    with the. variety of works he engaged in as an author, ſo impaired his
                    conſtitution, that after ſhe laſt exertion of his abilities to defend the
                    conduct of adminiſtration toward Mr Wilkes, by a pamphlet intitled, “ The Caſe
                    oſ the late election for the county of Middlesex conſidered,” he was prevented
                    from receiving the reward of a place in ſhe Treaſury, by dying in 1769, at about
                    46 years of age. Some time before his death, biſhop Warburton engaged him to
                    write his long promiſed <hi rend="italic">Life oſ Alexander Pope;</hi> which,
                    however, when executed, was very far from giving general ſatis faction-The
                    author attributed his ill ſucceſs to ſhe deficiency of his materials ; while the
                    public ſeemed rather to be oſ opinion that, as a lawyer, he ventured beyond his
                    proper line, when he affumed the taſk of a critic in poetry.</p>            </div>
