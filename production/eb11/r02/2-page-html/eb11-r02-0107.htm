<p><span class="font2">elongation of the spines of their cervical and dorsal vertebrae </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Dimetrodon,</span><span class="font2"> fig. 6). They seem to include various Triassic&nbsp;genera </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g. Aetosaurus, Belodon),</span><span class="font2"> which may perhaps belong to&nbsp;the ancestral stock of the Dinosauria and Crocodilia. Other&nbsp;Triassic genera </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Hyperodapedon, Rhynchosaurus)&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">scarcely differ from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon,</span><span class="font2"> except in the dentition and in the absence of the pineal foramen in the&nbsp;skull. In the late Cretaceous and early Eocene&nbsp;periods one genus </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Champsosaurus)</span><span class="font2"> was truly aquatic,&nbsp;with'gavial-shaped head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Order 6. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dinosauria.</span><span class="font2">—The dinosaurs arc land reptiles which flourished on all thc continents during&nbsp;the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, in the interval&nbsp;between the decline of the Anomodontia and the&nbsp;dominance of the Mammalia. They first appeared&nbsp;as carnivorous reptiles in the Triassic period in&nbsp;Europe, India, S. Africa, and N. America, but afterwards comprised numerous massive herbivores in&nbsp;nearly all parts of the world except the Australian&nbsp;and New Zealand regions. The skeleton in the&nbsp;carnivorous dinosaurs, or Theropoda, is of very light&nbsp;construction, the vertebrae and limb bones being&nbsp;hollow, with thin, dense walls and often perfectly&nbsp;fitting joints. The fore limbs are small, and the&nbsp;hind limbs are adapted for running, jumping or&nbsp;hopping on the toes. The sabre-shaped cutting&nbsp;teeth are fixed in sockets, and all the claws are&nbsp;sharp. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Anchisaurus</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hallopus,</span><span class="font2"> from the Trias&nbsp;of N. America, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Scleromochlus</span><span class="font2"> from the Elgin&nbsp;sandstones of Scotland, are comparatively small&nbsp;animals. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ceratosaurus</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Megalosaurus,</span><span class="font2"> from the&nbsp;Jurassic of North America and western Europe respectively, must have attained a length of from 5 to&nbsp;6 metres. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tyrannosaurus,</span><span class="font2"> from the Cretaceous of&nbsp;Montana, U.S.A., has a skull more than a metre in&nbsp;length. The herbivorous Dinosaurs of the suborder&nbsp;Ornithopoda resemble the Theropoda in general&nbsp;shape, but are heavier in build, with a pelvis constructed more nearly on the plan of that of a running bird. It has, indeed, been suggested that&nbsp;certain arboreal Dinosaurs of bipedal gait may have&nbsp;been the ancestors of the class Aves. The best-known Ornithopod is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Iguanodon</span><span class="font2"> (fig. 7), from the&nbsp;Wealden of W. Europe, with species from 5 to 10 metres in&nbsp;length. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Claosaurus,</span><span class="font2"> from the Cretaceous of N. America, is</span></p><div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font2">nearly similar, and is represented by at least one complete skeleton in the Yale University Museum. There are also members of the same group with a heavy armour of bony plates and spines,&nbsp;sometimes termed Stegosauria. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Stegosaurus</span><span class="font2"> itself occurs in&nbsp;thc Upper Jurassic of Colorado, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Omosaurus,</span><span class="font2"> from the&nbsp;Kimmcridge and Oxford clays of England, is a nearly similar&nbsp;reptile. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Polacanthus,</span><span class="font2"> from the Wcalden of the Isle of Wight,&nbsp;has the hip-region armoured with a continuous bony shield.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Triceratops</span><span class="font2"> (fig. 8) and its allies, from the Upper Cretaceous&nbsp;(Laramie) of western N. America, are the latest members of the&nbsp;group, with a bony frill over the neck, a pair of bony horn-cores above the eyes, and a median bony horn-core on the&nbsp;nose. The skull with the bony frill sometimes measures nearly&nbsp;two metres in length. Another suborder of herbivorous Dinosaurs, that of Sauropoda, comprises the largest known land&nbsp;animals of any age, some measuring from 17 to 25 metres in&nbsp;total length. They have a small head, long neck, and long&nbsp;tail, and must have been quadrupedal in gait. Their teeth&nbsp;are adapted for feeding on succulent water weeds, perhaps&nbsp;with an admixture of small ammâls living among these;&nbsp;and their vertebrae are of very light construction, while the&nbsp;ribs are raised high on the neural arches to increase the size&nbsp;of the body cavity, perhaps for unusually large lungs or air&nbsp;sacs. Their massive limbs have five toes, of which the three&nbsp;inner alone bear outwardly curved claws. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Diplodocus</span><span class="font2"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Brontosaurus,</span><span class="font2"> from the Jurassic of Wyoming and Colorado,&nbsp;U.S.A., are the best-known genera. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Atlantosaurus,</span><span class="font2"> from the&nbsp;same formation, is usually noteworthy for si/e. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cetiosaurus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">from the Jurassic </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font2">England, is also known by large parts of&nbsp;the skeleton in the British AIuseum and the Oxford Museum,&nbsp;indicating species nearly 20 metres in length.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
