 in mineralogy, a ſpecies of bitumen claſſed under the inflammable ſubſtances. As a full account of this mineral was given under the word <hi rend="smallcaps">Amber,</hi> nothing remains but to mention a few things which recent experiments enable us to add. According to Dr Kirwan, 100 grains of amber afford about 72 of petroleum, 4.5 of ſuccinic acid, and a reſidue of fixed matter and water. Mr Scheele ſays, that, when diſtilled, it yields an aqueous acid reſembling vinegar in its qualities. This would induce us to believe it to be of vegetable origin. But its origin is a point not yet aſcertained. Its ſpecific gravity is from 1,065 to 1,100, and melts at 550⁰ of Fahrenheit. Wallerius affirms, that mirrors, priſms, &amp;c. may be made of amber.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
