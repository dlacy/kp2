            <p>rate Jew, and its ſtyle is remarkable for ſimplicity. It abounds more with Hebraiſms
                than any of the other goſpels; and contains ſome ſtrong oriental figures which are
                not readily underſtood by an European.</p>
            <p>This goſpel is cited once by Clemens Romanus, by Barnabas three times, by Ignatius
                five times, by Juſtin Martyr fix times, by Irenæus, and above forty times by Clemens
                Alexandrinus.</p>
            <p>The book which we intitle the Acts of the Apoſtles connects the goſpels and the
                epiſtles. It is evidently a continuation of Luke’s goſpel, which appears both from
                the introduction and from the atteſtations of ancient Christians. Both are dedicated
                to Theophilus; and in the beginning of the Acts a reference is made to his goſpel,
                which he calls <hi rend="italic">a former treatiſe,</hi> recording the actions and
                diſcourſes of Jeſus till his aſcenſion to heaven. Luke is mentioned as the author of
                the Acts of the Apoſtles by Irenæus, by Tertullian, by Origen, and Euſebius.</p>
            <p>From the frequent uſe of the firſt perſon plural, it is manifeſt that Luke the author
                was preſent at many of the tranſactions which he relates. He appears to have
                accompanied Paul from Troas to Philippi. He attended him alſo to Jeruſalem, and
                afterwards to Rome, where he remained for two years. He is mentioned by Paul in
                ſeveral of thoſe epiſtles which were written from Rome, particularly in the 2d
                epiſtle to Timothy, and in the epiſtle to Philemon.</p>
            <p>This book contains the hiſtory of the Chriſtian church for the ſpace of about 28 or
                30 years, from the time of our Saviour’s aſcenſion to Paul’s arrival at Rome in the
                year 60 or 61. As it informs us that Paul reſided two years in Rome, it muſt have
                been written after the year 63; and as the death of Paul is not mentioned, it is
                probable it was compoſed beſore that event, which happened A. D. 65.</p>
            <p>The Acts of the Apoſtles may be divided into ſeven parts. I. The account of our
                Saviour’s aſcenſion, and of the occurrences which happened on the firſt Pentecoſt
                after that event, contained in chap. i. ii. 2. The transactions of the Chriſtians σf
                the circumciſion at Jeruſalem, in Judea, and Samaria, chap. iii.—ix. xi. I—21. xii.
                3. Tranſactions in Cæſarea, and the admiſſion of the Gentiles, chap. x. 4. The firſt
                circuit of Barnabas and Paul among the Gentiles, chap. xi. 22. xiii. xiv. 5. Embaſſy
                to Jeruſalem, and the firſt council held in that city, chap. xv. <hi rend="italic"
                    >6.</hi> Paul’s ſecond journey, chap. xvi.—xxi. 7. His arreſtment, trial, appeal
                to Cæſar, and journey to Rome, chap. xxi. to the end of the book.</p>
            <p>The Acts of the Apoſtles are cited by Clemens Romanus, by Polycarp, by Juſtin Martyr,
                thirty times by Irenæus, and ſeven times by Clemens Alexandrinus.</p>
            <p>All the eſſential doctrines and precepts of the Christian religion were certainly
                taught by our Saviour himſelf, and are contained in the goſpels. The epiſtles may be
                conſidered as commentaries on the doctrines of the goſpel, addreſſed to particular
                ſocieties, accommodated to their reſpective ſituations; intended to refute the</p>
            <p>errors and false notions which prevailed among them, and to inculcate thoſe virtues
                in which they were moſt deficient.</p>
            <p>The plan on which theſe <hi rend="smallcaps">Letters</hi> are written is, firſt, to
                decide the controverſy, or refute the erroneous notions which had ariſen in the
                ſociety to which the epiſtle was addreſſed: And, ſecondly, to recommend thoſe duties
                which their falſe doctrines might induce them to neglect; at the same time
                inculcating in general exhortations the moſt important precepts of Christian
                morality.</p>
            <p>Of the epiſtles fourteen were written by St Paul. Theſe are not placed according to
                the order of time in which they were compoſed, but according to the ſuppoſed
                precedence of the ſocieties or perdons to whom they were addressed. It will be
                proper therefore to exhibit here their chronological order according to Dr
                Lardner.</p>
