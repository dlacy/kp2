The proceſs, therefore, of rope-making is more complicated.</p><p>The firſt part of this proceſs is spinning of rope» yarns. This is done in various ways, and with different machinery, according to the nature of the intended cordage. We- ſhall confine our dcſcription to the manufacture of the larger kinds, ſuch as are uſed for the ſtanding and running rigging of ſhips.</p><p>1 An alley or walk is incloſed for the purpoſe, about <hi rend="sub">ι</hi> 200 fathoms long, and of a breadth ſuited to the extent of the manufacture. It is ſometimes covered above. At the upper end of this rope-walk is ſet up the ſpm-ning-whεel, of a fprm' reſembling that in ſig- i. The ’band of this wheel goes over ſeveral rollers called whirls, turning on pivots in braſs holes. The pivots at one end come through the frame, and terminate in little hooks. The wheel being turned by a winch, gives motion in one direction to all thoſe whirls. The ſpinner has a bundle of dreſſed hemp round his waiſt, with the two ends meeting before - him. The hemp is laid in this bundle in the ſame way that women ſpread the flax on the diſtaff. There is great variety in this ; but the general aim is to lay the fibres in ſuch a manner, that as long as .the bundle laſts there may be an equal number of the ends at the extremity, and that a fibre may never offer itſelf double or in a bight. The ſpinner draws out a proper number of fibres, twiſts them with his fingers, and having got a ſuſſicient length detached, he fixes it to the hook of a whirl. The wheel is now turned, and the ſkain is twilled, becoming what is called a rope-yarn, and the ſpinner walks backwards down the rope-walk. The part already twiſted draws along with it more fibres out of the bundle. The ſpinner aids this with his fingers, ſupplying hemp in due proportion as he walks away from the wheel, and taking care that the fibres come in equally from both ſides -of his bundle, and that they enter always with their ends, and not by the middle, which would double them. He ſhould alſo endeavour to enter every fibre at the heart of the yam. Ί his will cauſe all the fibres to mix equally in making it up, and will make the work ſmootli, becauſe one end of each fibre is by this means buried among the reft, and the other end only lies outward ; and this, in paſſing through the graſp of the ſpinner, who preſſes it tight with his thumb and palm, is alſo made to lie ſmootli. The greateſt fault that can be committed in ſpinning is to allow a ſmall thread to be twiſted off from one ſide of the hemp, and then to cover this with hemp ſupplied from the other ſide : for it is evident that the fibres of the central thread make very long ſpirals, and the ſkin of fibres which covers them muſt be much more oblique. This covering has but little connection with what is below it, and will eafily be detached. But even while it remains, the yarn cannot be ſtrong ; for on pulling it, the middle part, which lies the ſtraighteſt, muſt bear all the ſtrain, while the outer fibres, that are lying obliquely, are only drawn a little more parallel to the axis. This defect will always happen if the hemp be ſupplied hi.a conſiderable body to a yarn that is then ſpinning ſmall. Into whatever part of the yarn it is made to enter, it becomes a fortof looſely connected wrapper. Such a yarn, when untwiſted a little, will have the appearance of ſig. 2. while a good yarn looks like ſig. 3. A good ſpinner therefore endeavours always to ſupply the hemp in the form of a thin fiat ſkain with his left hand, while his right is employed in graſp-ing firmly the yarn that is twining off, and in holding it tight from the whirl, that it may not run into loops or kinks..</p><p>It is evident, that both the arrangement of the fibres and the degree of twiſting depend on the ſkill and dexterity of the ſpinner, and that he muſt be inſtructed, not by a book, but by a matter. The degree of twiſt depends on the rate of the wheel’s motion, combined with the retrograde walk of the ſpinner.</p><p>We may ſuppoſe lιim arrived at the <hi rend="italic">lower</hi>  end of the walk, or as far as is neceſſary for the intended length of his yarn·. He calls out, and another ſpinner immediately detaches the yarn from the hook of the whirl, gives it to another, who carries it aſide to the reel, and this ſecond ſpinner attaches his own hemp to the whiιl hook. In the mean time, the firſt ſpinner keeps faſt hold of the end of his yarn ; for the hemp, being dry, is very elaſtic, and if he were to let it go out of his hand it would inſtantly untwiſt, and become little better than looſe hemp. He waits, therefore, till he fees the reeler begin to turn the reel, and he. goes flowly up the walk, keeping the yam of an equal tightneſs all the way, till he arrives at the wheel, where he waits with his yarn in hand till another ſpinner has ſiniſhed his yarn. 1 he firſt ſpinner takes it off the whirl hook, joins it to his own, that it may follow it on the reel, and begins a new yam.</p><p>Rope-yarns, for the greateſt part of the large rigging, are from a quarter of an inch to ſomewhat more than a third of an inch in circumference, or of ſuch a ſize that 160 fathoms weigh from 3 '<hi rend="sub">τ</hi> to 4 pounds when white. The different ſizes of-yarns are named from the numbe&gt; of them contained in a ſtrand of a rope of three inches in circumference. Few are ſo coarſe that 16 will make a ſtrand of Britiſh ccrd3ge ; 18 is not unfrequent for cable yarns, or yams ſpun from harſh and coarſe hemp ; 25 is, we believe, the fineſt ſize which is worked up for the rigging of a ſhip, Much finer are indeed ſpun for founding lines, liſhing lines, and many other marine uſes. and for the other demands ot ſociety. Ten good ſpinners will work up above 600 weight of hemp in a day; but this depends on the weather. In very dry weather the hemp is very elaſtic, and requires great attention to make ſmootli work. In the warmer climates, the ſpinner is permitted to moillen the rag with which he graſps the yarn in his right hand-for each yarn. No work can be done in an open ſpinning walk in rainy weather, becauſe the yarns would not take on the tar, if immediately tarred, and would rot if kept on the reel for a long. time.</p><p>The ſecond part of the proceſs is. the converſion oſ</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
