<p><span class="font1">should resign all property derived from the crown and depend solely on tithes and donations, while the empire&nbsp;should resign the right of investiture. Henry seemed&nbsp;disposed to accept the suggestion, but, suddenly changing&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">hjs </span><span class="font1">mind, took the pope prisoner and forced him to yield&nbsp;the right of investiture and to give him the crown (1111).&nbsp;But the following year the party of reform annulled in&nbsp;council this concession, which the pope declared to have&nbsp;been extorted by force. By the death of Countess Matilda&nbsp;in 1115 and the bequest of her vast possessions to the&nbsp;Holy See, the pope’s dominions were greatly enlarged,&nbsp;but his authority as a ruler was nowise increased.&nbsp;Deeds of violence still continued in Rome; and then&nbsp;followed the death of the prefect Pietro. The nobles of&nbsp;the imperial party, joined with the people, wished to elect&nbsp;Pietro’s son, also nephew to Tolomeo of Tusculum, who&nbsp;then held the position of a potent imperial margrave,&nbsp;had territories stretching from the Sabine mountains to&nbsp;the sea, was the dictator of Tusculum, master of Latium,&nbsp;and consul of the Romans. The pope opposed this&nbsp;election to the best of his strength ; but the nobles carried&nbsp;the day, and their new prefect received investiture from&nbsp;the emperor. Upon this the pope again quitted Rome,&nbsp;and on his return, two years later, was compelled to shut&nbsp;himself up in Castle St Angelo, where he died in 1118.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The popes were now the sport of the nobles whom they had aggrandized by continual concessions for the sake of&nbsp;peace. And peace seemed at hand when Innocent II.&nbsp;(1130-43), after triumphing over two antipopes, came to&nbsp;terms with Roger L, recognized him as king of Sicily, and&nbsp;gained his friendship and protection. But now still graver&nbsp;tumults took place. In consequence of the division of&nbsp;the nobles neither party could overcome its foes without&nbsp;the aid of the people, which thus became increasingly&nbsp;powerful. Throughout Upper and Central Italy the cities&nbsp;were being organized as free and independent communes&nbsp;on a democratic basis. Their example was soon followed&nbsp;in the ancient duchy of Rome and almost in the immediate&nbsp;neighbourhood of the city. Even Tivoli was converted&nbsp;into a republic. This excited the deepest jealousy in the&nbsp;Romans, and they became furious when this little city,&nbsp;profiting by its strong position in the Teverone valley, not&nbsp;only sought to annex Roman territory, but dared to offer&nbsp;successful resistance to the descendants of the conquerors&nbsp;of the world. In 1141 Tivoli openly rebelled against the&nbsp;mother city, and the pope sent the Romans to subdue it.&nbsp;They were not only repulsed, but Ignominiously pursued&nbsp;to their own gates. Afterwards, returning to the assault&nbsp;in greater numbers, they conquered the hostile town. Its&nbsp;defenders surrendered to the pope, and he immediately&nbsp;concluded a treaty of peace without consulting either the&nbsp;people or the republic. The soldiery, still flushed with&nbsp;victory, were furious at this slight. They demanded not&nbsp;only the submission of Tivoli to the Roman people, but also&nbsp;permission to demolish its walls and dwellings and expel&nbsp;its population. Innocent II. refused consent to these&nbsp;excesses, and a memorable revolution ensued by which the&nbsp;temporal power of the papacy was entirely overthrown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1143 the rebellious people rushed to the Capitol, proclaimed the republic, reconstituted the senate, to the almost entire exclusion of the nobles, declared the abolition&nbsp;of the temporal power, issued coin inscribed to the senate,&nbsp;the people, and St Peter, and began to reckon time from&nbsp;the day of the restoration of liberty. Arnold of Brescia&nbsp;was not, as has been incorrectly stated, the author of this&nbsp;revolution, for he had not yet arrived in Rome. It was the&nbsp;outcome of an historic necessity—above all of the renewed&nbsp;vigour of the people and its detestation of the feudal&nbsp;aristocracy. This body, besides being divided into an&nbsp;imperial and a national party, had almost excluded from&nbsp;the government the powerful baronage of the Campagna&nbsp;and the provinces. Also, as we have before noted, the&nbsp;Roman aristocracy was by no means an exclusive caste.&nbsp;Between the great aristocrats and the people there stood&nbsp;a middle or new nobility, which made common cause with&nbsp;the people, whose chief strength now lay in the army.&nbsp;This, divided into twelve and then into thirteen or fourteen regions, assembled under its banners all arm-bearing&nbsp;citizens. Thus the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">exercitus</span><span class="font1"> was also the real </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">populus&nbsp;Romanus,</span><span class="font1"> now bent on the destruction of the temporal&nbsp;power. This purpose, originating in the struggle of the&nbsp;investitures, was the logical and inevitable result of the&nbsp;proposals of Paschal IL, which, despite their rejection,&nbsp;found a loud echo in Italy. Lucius II. (1144-45) tried&nbsp;to withstand the revolution by seeking Norman aid and&nbsp;throwing himself into the arms of the feudal party, but this&nbsp;only precipitated the course of events. The people, after&nbsp;having excluded nearly all aristocrats from the senate, now&nbsp;placed at its head the noble Giordano dei Pierleoni, who&nbsp;had joined the revolutionary party. They named him&nbsp;patrician, but without prejudice to the authority of the&nbsp;empire, still held by them in respect, and also conferred&nbsp;on him the judicial powers appertaining to the aristocratic&nbsp;and imperial office of prefect. The pope was requested to&nbsp;resign the temporal power, the regalia, and every other&nbsp;possession, and content himself with the tithes and&nbsp;offerings of the faithful according to the scheme of Paschal</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">II. He indignantly refused, marched at the head of the&nbsp;nobles against the Capitol, but was violently repulsed, and&nbsp;received a blow on the head from a stone, which is supposed&nbsp;to have occasioned his speedy death on the l5th February&nbsp;1145. Eugenius III. was then elected (1145-53), but&nbsp;soon had to fly to Viterbo in quest of armed assistance,&nbsp;in consequence of the senate’s resolve to forcibly prevent&nbsp;his consecration until he recognized the new state of things&nbsp;in the Eternal City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It was at this moment that Arnold of Brescia arrived in Rome. His ideas, already well known in Italy, had&nbsp;inspired and promoted the Roman revolution, and he now&nbsp;came to determine its method and direction. Born at&nbsp;Brescia in the beginning of the l2th century, Arnold had&nbsp;studied in France under the celebrated Abelard, who had&nbsp;instructed him in theology and philosophy, inspired him&nbsp;with a great love for antiquity, and stimulated his natural&nbsp;independence of mind. On returning to his native land&nbsp;he assumed the monkish habit, and proved the force and&nbsp;fervour of his character by taking part in all struggles for&nbsp;liberty. And, together with political reform, he preached&nbsp;his favourite doctrine of the necessary renunciation by&nbsp;the clergy of all temporal wealth. Expounded with&nbsp;singular eloquence, these doctrines had a stirring effect on&nbsp;men’s minds, spread throughout the cities of northern&nbsp;Italy, and were echoed on all sides. It seems undoubted&nbsp;that they penetrated to Rome and helped to promote the&nbsp;revolution, so that Arnold was already present in spirit&nbsp;before he arrived there in person. It is known that at&nbsp;the Lateran council of 1139 Innocent II. had declared&nbsp;these doctrines to be inimical to the church and enjoined&nbsp;silence on their author. And, as at that time the party&nbsp;hostile to liberty was triumphant in Brescia, Arnold left&nbsp;his native place, crossed the Alps, and returned to France,&nbsp;where other struggles awaited him. He professed no&nbsp;anti-Catholic dogmas,—only maintaining that when the&nbsp;pope and the prelacy deviated from the gospel rule of&nbsp;poverty they should not be obeyed, but fearlessly opposed.&nbsp;In France, finding his master, Abelard, exposed to the&nbsp;persecutions of St Bernard, he assumed his defence with&nbsp;so much ardour that St Bernard directed the thunders of&nbsp;his eloquence against the disciple as well as the master,&nbsp;saying of the former, “ He neither eats nor drinks,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
