<p><span class="font2">French literature was quick to respond to Renaissance influences. T)e Comines, thc historian of Charles VIll.’s expedition to Naples,&nbsp;differs from the earlier French chroniclers in his way of&nbsp;regarding the world of men and affairs. He has the&nbsp;perspicuity and analytical penetration of a Venetian&nbsp;ambassador. Villon, his contemporary, may rather be ranked,&nbsp;so far as artistic form and use of knowledge are concerned, with&nbsp;poets of the middle ages, and in particular with the Goliardi. But&nbsp;he is essentially modern in the vividness of his self-portraiture,&nbsp;and in what we are wont to call realism. Both De Comines and&nbsp;Villon indicate the entrance of a new quality into literature. Thc&nbsp;Rhétoriqueurs, while protracting medieval traditions by their use&nbsp;of allegory and complicated metrical systems, sought to improve&nbsp;the French language by introducing Latinisms. Thus the Revival&nbsp;of Learning began to affect the vernacular in the last years of the&nbsp;15th century. Marot and his school reacted against this pedantry.&nbsp;The Renaissance displayed itself in their effort to purify the form&nbsp;and diction of poetry. But the decisive revolution was effected&nbsp;by Ronsard and his comrades of the Pléiade. It was their professed&nbsp;object to raise French to a level with the classics, and to acclimatize&nbsp;Italian species of verse. The humanistic movement led these&nbsp;learned writers to engraft the graces of the antique Uponjtheir&nbsp;native literature, and to refine it by emulating the lucidity of&nbsp;Petrarch. The result of their endeavour was immediately apparent&nbsp;in the new force added to French rhythm, the new pomp, richness,&nbsp;colouring and polish conferred upon poetic diction. French style&nbsp;gradually attained to fixity, and the alexandrine came to be recognized as the standard line in poetry. D’Aubigné’s invective and&nbsp;Regnier’s satire, at the close of the 16th century, are as modern as&nbsp;Voltaire’s. Meanwhile the drama was emerging from the medieval&nbsp;mysteries; and the classical type, made popular by Garnier’s&nbsp;genius, was elaborated, as in Italy, upon the model of Seneca and&nbsp;the canons of the three unities. The tradition thus formed was&nbsp;continued and fortified by the illustrious playwrights of the 17th&nbsp;Centuiy<sup>r</sup>. Translation from Greek and Latin into French progressed&nbsp;rapidly at the commencement of this period. It was a marked&nbsp;characteristic of the Renaissance in France to appropriate the&nbsp;spoils of Greece and Rome for the profit of the mother tongue.&nbsp;Amyot’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Plutarch</span><span class="font2"> and his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Daphnis and Chloe</span><span class="font2"> rank among the&nbsp;most exquisite examples of beautiful French prose. Prose had now&nbsp;the charm of simplicity combined with grace. To mention Brantôme is to mention the most entertaining of gossips. To speak of&nbsp;Montaigne is to speak of the best as well as the first of essayists.&nbsp;In all the literary work which has been mentioned, the originality&nbsp;and freshness of the French genius are no less conspicuous&nbsp;than its saturation with the new learning and with Italian&nbsp;studies. But the greatest name of the epoch, the name which&nbsp;is synonymous with the Renaissance in France, has yet to be&nbsp;uttered. That, of course, is Rabelais. His incommensurable&nbsp;and indescribable masterpiece of mingled humour, wisdom,&nbsp;satire, erudition,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indecency,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;profundity, levity,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imagina</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">tion, realism, reflects the whole age in its mirror of hyper-Aristophanic farce. What Ariosto is for Italy, Cervantes for Spain, Erasmus for Holland, Luther for Germany, Shakespeare&nbsp;for England, that </span><span class="font1">is </span><span class="font2">Rabelais for France. The Renaissance cannot be comprehended in its true character without familiarity&nbsp;with these six representatives of its manifold and many-sided</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">inspiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The French Renaissance, so rich on the side of arts and letters, was hardly less rich on the side of classical studies. The revival&nbsp;of learning has a noble muster-roll of names in France:&nbsp;Turnebus, the patriarch’ of Hellenistic studies; the&nbsp;Étiennes of Paris, equalling in numbers, industry and&nbsp;learning their Venetian rivals; the two Scaligers; impassioned Dolet; eloquent Muret; learned Cujas; terrible&nbsp;Calvin; Ramus, the intrepid antagonist of Aristotle;&nbsp;De Thou and De Bèze;\ponderous Casaubon; brilliant&nbsp;young Saumaise. The distinguishing characteristics of French&nbsp;humanism are vivid intelligence, critical audacity and polemical&nbsp;acumen,* perspicuity of exposition, learning directed in its applications by logical sense rather than by artistic ideals of taste.&nbsp;Some of the names just mentioned remind us that in France, as&nbsp;in Germany and Holland, the Reformation was closely connected&nbsp;with the revival of learning. Humanism has never been in the&nbsp;narrow sense of that term Protestant ; still less has it been strictly&nbsp;Catholic. In Italy it fostered a temper of mind decidedly averse&nbsp;to theological speculation and religious earnestness. In Holland&nbsp;and Germany, with Erasmus, Reuchlin and Melanchthon, it developed types of character, urbane, reflective, pointedly or gently&nbsp;critical, which, left to themselves, would not have plunged the north&nbsp;of Europe into the whirlpool of belligerent reform. Yet none the&nbsp;less was the new learning, through the open spirit of inquiry it&nbsp;nourished, its vindication of the private reason, its enthusiasm for&nbsp;republican antiquity, and its proud assertion of the rights of human&nbsp;independence, linked by a strong and subtle chain to that turbid&nbsp;revolt of the individual consciousness against spiritual, despotism&nbsp;•draped in fallacies and throned upon abuses. To this rebellion&nbsp;we give the name of Reformation. But, while the necessities of&nbsp;•antagonism to papal Rome made it assume at first the form of&nbsp;narrow and sectarian opposition, it marked in fact a vital struggle&nbsp;of the intellect towards truth and freedom, involving future results&nbsp;of scepticism and rationalistic audacity from which its earlier&nbsp;champions would have shrunk. It marked, moreover, in the condition of armed resistance against established authority which was&nbsp;forced upon it by the Counter-Reformation, a firm resolve to assert&nbsp;political liberty, leading in thc course of time to a revolution with&nbsp;which the rebellious spirit of the Revival was sympathetic. This&nbsp;being thc relation of humanism in general to reform, French learning in particular displayed such innovating boldness as threw many&nbsp;of its. most conspicuous professors into the camp at war with Rome.&nbsp;Calvin, a French student of Picard origin, created the type of&nbsp;Protestantism to which the majority of French Huguenotsadhered.&nbsp;This, too was a moment at which philosophical seclusion was hardly&nbsp;possible. In a nation so tumultuously agitated one side or the&nbsp;other had to be adopted. Those of the French humanists who did&nbsp;not proclaim Huguenot opinions found themselves obliged with&nbsp;Muretus to lend their talents to the Counter-Reformation, or to&nbsp;suffer persecution for heterodoxy, like DoIet. The church, terrified&nbsp;and infuriated by the progress of reform, suspected learning on its&nbsp;own account. To be an eminent scholar was to be accused of&nbsp;immorality, heresy and atheism in a single indictment; and the&nbsp;defence of weaker minds lav in joining the Jesuits, as Heinsius was&nbsp;fain to do. France had afready absorbed the earlier Renaissance&nbsp;in an Italianizing spirit before the Reformation made itself felt&nbsp;as a political actuality. . This fact, together with the strong&nbsp;Italian bias of the Valois, serves to explain in some degree&nbsp;the reason why the Counter-Reformation entailed those fierce&nbsp;entangled civil wars, massacres of St Bartholomew, murders&nbsp;of. the Guises, regicides, treasons and empoisonmcnts that terminated with the compromise of Henry IV. It is no part&nbsp;of the present subject to analysi the political, religious and&nbsp;social interests of that struggle. The upshot was the triumph&nbsp;of. the Counter-Reformation, and the establishment of its&nbsp;principle, absolutism, as the basis of French government. It&nbsp;was a French king who, when thc nation had been reduced to&nbsp;order, uttered the famous word of absolutism, “ L’État, c’est&nbsp;moi.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Renaissance in the Low Countries, as elsewhere, had its brilliant age of arts and letters. During the middle ages the wealthy&nbsp;free, towns of FIanders flourished under conditions not&nbsp;dissimilar to those of the Italian republics. They raised&nbsp;miracles of architectural beauty, which were modified in&nbsp;the 15th and 16th centuries by characteristic elements&nbsp;of the new style. The Van Eycks, followed by Memling,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Metsys, Mabuse, Lucas.van Leyden, struck out a new path in the revival of painting and taught Europe the secret&nbsp;of oil-colouring. But it was reserved for the 17th century&nbsp;to witness the flower and fruit time of this powerful art in&nbsp;the work of Porbus, Rubens and Vandyck, in the Dutch schools&nbsp;of landscape and home-life, and in the unique masterpieces of&nbsp;Rembrandt. We have a right to connect this later period with&nbsp;the. Renaissance, because the distracted state of the Netherlands&nbsp;during the 16th century suspended, while it could not extinguish,&nbsp;their aesthetic development. The various schools of the 17th&nbsp;century, moreover, are animated with the Renaissance spirit no&nbsp;less surely than the Florentine school of the 15th or the Venetian&nbsp;of the 16th. The animal vigour and carnal enjoyment of Rubens,&nbsp;the refined Italianizing beauty of Vandyck, the mystery of light&nbsp;and gloom on Rembrandt's panels, the Iove of nature in Ruysdael,&nbsp;Cuyp and Van Hooghe, with their luminously misty skies, silvery&nbsp;daylight and broad expanse of landscape, the interest in common&nbsp;life displayed by Ter Borch, Van Steen, Douw<sub>1</sub> Ostade and Teniers,&nbsp;the instinct for the beauty of animals in Potter, the vast sea spaces&nbsp;of Vanderveldt, the grasp, on reality, the acute intuition into character in portraits, the scientific study of the world and man, the&nbsp;robust sympathy with natural appetites, which distinguish the&nbsp;whole art of the Low Countries, are a direct emanation from the&nbsp;Renaissance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The vernacular in the Netherlands profited at first but little by the impulse which raised Italian, Spanish, French and English&nbsp;to the rank of classic languages. But humanism, first of&nbsp;all in its protagonist Erasmus, afterwards in the long&nbsp;list of critical scholars and editors, Lipsius<sub>1</sub> Heinsius&nbsp;and Grotius, in the printers Elzevirand Plantin, developed&nbsp;itself from the centre of the Leiden university with&nbsp;massive energy, and proved that it was still a motive force&nbsp;of intellectual progress. In thc fields of classical learning the&nbsp;students of the Low Countries broke new ground, chiefly by&nbsp;methodical collection, classification and comprehensive criticism&nbsp;of previously accumulated stores. Their works were solid and substantial edifices, forming the substratum for future scholarship.&nbsp;In addition to this they brought philosophy and scientific thoroughness to bear on studies which had been pursued in a more literary&nbsp;spirit. It would, however, be uncritical to pursue this subject&nbsp;further; for the encyclopaedic labours of the Dutch philologers&nbsp;belong to a period when tte Renaissance was overpast. For thc&nbsp;same reason it is inadmissible to do more than mention the name&nbsp;of Spinoza here.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
