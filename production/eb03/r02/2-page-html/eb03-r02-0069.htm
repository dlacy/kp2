But any perfora accuftoιned to the uſe of the ſeale and com-paſſes will form to himſelf rules of practice equally ſure&nbsp;and more expeditious than Mr de Buat’s formul</span><span class="font6">æ</span><span class="font1">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We proceed, therefore, to what is more to out purpoſe, the conſideration of the reſiſtance cauſed by an elbow, and the methods of providing a force capable of overcoming it, We have already taken notice of&nbsp;the ſalutary conſequences ariſihg from the rambling&nbsp;courſe of rivers, inaſmuc'h as it more effectually ſpreads&nbsp;them over the face of a country. It is no leſs beneficial by diminiſhing their velocity. This it does both&nbsp;by lengthening their courſe, which dimim’ſhes the declivity, and by the very reſiſtance which they meet with&nbsp;at every bend. We derive the chief advantages from&nbsp;•our rivers, when they no longer ſhoot their way from&nbsp;precipice to precipice, loaded with mud and fand, but&nbsp;peaceably roll along their clear waters, purified during&nbsp;their gentler courſe, and offer themſelves for all the purpoſes of paſturage, agriculture, and navigation. The&nbsp;more a river winds its way round the foot of the hills,&nbsp;the more is the reſiſtance of its bed multiplied ; the&nbsp;more obſtacles it meets with in its way ſrom its ſource&nbsp;'to the ſea, the more moderate is its velocity ; and in-ftead of tearing up the very bowels of the earth, and&nbsp;«digging for itſelf a deep trough, along which it ſweeps&nbsp;rocks and rooted-np trees, it flows with majeſtic pace&nbsp;’even with the ſurface of our cultivated grounds, which&nbsp;it embelliſhes and fertilizes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We may with ſafety proceed on the ſirppoſition, that the force neceſſary for overcoming the reſiſtance ariſiwg&nbsp;ſrom a rebound is as the ſquare of &quot;the velocity ; and it&nbsp;is reaſonable to ſuppoſe it proportional to the ſquare of&nbsp;the fine of the angle of incidence, and this for the rea-fons given for adopting this meaſure of the general </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Resistance of Fluids.</span><span class="font1"> It cannot, however, claim a greater&nbsp;confidence here than in that application ; and it has been&nbsp;ſhown in that article with what uncertainty and limitations it muſt be received. We leave it to our readers to&nbsp;adopt either this or the ſimple ratio of the fines, and&nbsp;ſhall abide by the duplicate ratio with Mr Buat,becauſe&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">fit </span><span class="font1">appears by his experiments that this law is very exactly obſerved in tubes in inclinations not 'exceeding&nbsp;4.0 ' ; whereas it is in theſe ſmall angles that the application to the general reſiſtance of fluids is moſt in&nbsp;4ault. But the correction is very ſimple, if this value ſhall&nbsp;be found erroneous There can be little doubt that the&nbsp;force neceſſary for overcoming the reſiſtance will increaſe&nbsp;•as the number of rebounds.-—Therefore we may expreſs the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">V<sup>x</sup> j <sup>i</sup> n</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">veſiſtance, in general, by the formula </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r— —</span><span class="font1">—; where </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">m</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">r </span><span class="font1">is the reſiſtance, </span><span class="font2">V </span><span class="font1">the mean velocity of the ſtream, » the fine of the angle of incidence, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font1"> the number of&nbsp;equal rebounds (that is, having equal angles of incidence), and m is a number to be determined by experiment. Mr de Buat made many experiments on the reſiſtance occaſioned by the bendings of pipes, none of&nbsp;which differed from the reſult of the above formula&nbsp;•above one part in twelve ; and he concludes, that the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">V<sup>1</sup> j<sup>i</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">reſiſtance to one bend may he eftimateu at —-</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">*ſſhe </span><span class="font1">experiment was in thig form : </span><span class="font2">A </span><span class="font1">pipe of j inch ^diameter, and 10 feet </span><span class="font4">loςg, </span><span class="font3">wu </span><span class="font1">formed with to rebounds of 36<sup>0</sup> each. </span><span class="font2">A </span><span class="font1">head of water was applied&nbsp;to ιi, which gave the water a velocity of </span><span class="font2">fix </span><span class="font1">ſeet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per ſecond.</span><span class="font1"> Another pipe of the ſame diameter and length,&nbsp;but without any bendings, was ſubjected to a preſſure&nbsp;of a head of water, which was increaſed till the velocity of efflux was alſo ſix ſeet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font1"> ſecond. The additional head of water was   inches. Another of the&nbsp;ſame diameter and length, having one bend of 24.<sup>0</sup> 34',&nbsp;and running 85 inches </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font1"> ſecond, was compared with&nbsp;a ſtraight pipe having the ſame velocity, and the difference of tire heads of water was   of an inch. A&nbsp;computation from theſe two experiments will give the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">V<sup>1</sup> </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">j<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">above reſult, or, in Engliſh meaſure, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">r — --—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">3200</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">very nearly. It is probable that this meaſure of the reſiſtance is too great ; for the pipe was of uniform diameter even in the bends : whereas in a river properly&nbsp;formed, where the regimen is exact, the capacity of the&nbsp;ſectiiui of the bend is increaſed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The application of this theory to inclined tubes and to open ſtreams is very obvious, and very legitimate and&nbsp;ſafe. Let AB (fig. 17.) be the whole height of the&nbsp;reſervoir A B I K, and B C the horizontal length of </span><span class="font2">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">pipe, containing any number of rebounds, equal or unequal, but all regular, that is, conſtructed according to&nbsp;the conditions formerly mentioned. The whole head of&nbsp;water ſhould be conceived as performing, or as divided&nbsp;into portions which perform, three different offices.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">V<sup>5</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One portion, </span><span class="font2">AD — ——, </span><span class="font1">impels the water into thé</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">505</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">entry of the pipe with the velocity with which it really moves in it ; another portion EB is in equilibrio with&nbsp;the reſiſtances ariſing from the mere length of the pipé&nbsp;expanded into a ſtraight line ; and the third portion DE&nbsp;ſerves to overcome the reſiſtance of the bends. If,&nbsp;therefore, we draw the horizontal line B C, and, taking the pipe B C out of its place, put it in the poſition DH, with its mouth C in Η, ſo that DH is equal&nbsp;to BC, the water will have the ſame velocity in it that&nbsp;it had before. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">N. B.</span><span class="font1"> For greater ſimplicity of argument, we may ſuppoſe that when the pipe was inſerted&nbsp;at B, its bends lay all in a horizontal plane, and that&nbsp;when it is inſerted at D, the plane in which all its bends&nbsp;lie ſlopes only in the direction DH, and is perpendicular to the plane of the figure. We repeat it, the water will have the ſame velocity in the pipes B C and&nbsp;D H, and the reſiſtances will be overcome. If we now&nbsp;prolong the pipe D H towards L to any diſtance, repeating continually the ſame bendings in a ſeries of&nbsp;lengths, each equal to D H, the motion will be continued with the velocity correſponding to the preſſure of&nbsp;the column AD ; becauſe the declivity of the pipe is&nbsp;augmented in each length equal to DH, by a quantity&nbsp;preciſely &quot;ſufficient for overcoming all the reſiſtances ift&nbsp;that length ; and the true ſlope in theſe caſes is B E-f-E D, divided by the expanded length of the pipe B C&nbsp;or DH.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>,</sup>J </span><span class="font1">he analogy which we were enabled to eſtabliſh between the uniform motion or the train of pipes and of open ſtreams, intitles us now to ſay, that when a river&nbsp;has bendings, which are regularly repeated at equal intervals, its ſlope is compounded of the ſlope which is&nbsp;neceſſary for overcoming the reſiſtance of a ſtraight&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">channel of its whole </span><span class="font1">expanded </span><span class="font2">length, </span><span class="font1">agreeably to</span></p>
