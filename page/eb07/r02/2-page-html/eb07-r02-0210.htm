<p><span class="font1">ROOT. See Algebra, Arithmetic, and Equations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROPE, a general name for all kinds of cordage, but more correctly applied to such as is above one inch in circumference, the smaller sorts being distinguished by the&nbsp;names of twines, cords, and lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The art of twisting into lines and ropes various materials, such as thongs of animal hide, the hairs of animals, </span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font1">ough grasses, and vegetable fibres, is of remote antiquity,&nbsp;and has existed even among the rudest people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The tarabita or rope-bridge of the Peruvians, and the lasso of the Chilian hunter, are formed by twisting together&nbsp;thongs of ox's hide ; and in our own country at the present day ropes for particular purposes are made of horse’s&nbsp;hair. The coir-ropes of Ceylon and the Maldive islands&nbsp;are made from the fibrous husk of the cocoa-nut ; the&nbsp;Manilla rope from the fibres of a species of the wild banana, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Musa textilis ;</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sunn</span><span class="font1"> ropes from those&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crotolariajuncea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many other vegetables have fibres of great tenacity, and fitted for the purposes of the rope-maker ; but preference&nbsp;is given to those of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cannabis sativa,</span><span class="font1"> or cultivated hemp,&nbsp;and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Linum usitatissimum,</span><span class="font1"> or flax, the fibres of both of&nbsp;which possess in a remarkable degree the essential qualities&nbsp;of flexibility and tenacity. Some idea of the importance of&nbsp;the manufacture under consideration may be obtained from&nbsp;the fact that, in the year ending January 1839, the value of&nbsp;the hemp alone imported into Great Britain and Ireland&nbsp;was L.617,597, and the value of the cordage exported was&nbsp;L.94,639.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The fibres of the hemp are first twisted together to form a thread or yarn. Many yarns are then combined by twisting,&nbsp;and form a strand ; three strands are in like manner combined, and form what is properly a rope, and technically termed&nbsp;a shroud-laid rope or hawser-laid rope ; and three of these&nbsp;ropes may be again combined, forming what is termed a&nbsp;cable-laid rope. The fibres should be so arranged that&nbsp;each in the finished rope shall offer the greatest resistance&nbsp;to its being torn asunder in the direction of its length.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If we take a bundle of fibres, equal in length and strength, and fasten it at the ends, each fibre will, upon a strain being&nbsp;applied to the bundle, bear its proper share of the stress ;&nbsp;and the strength of the bundle will evidently be measured by adding together the strength of the separate fibres. But if we twist this bundle so as to form a thread,&nbsp;the strain will no longer be equally distributed among&nbsp;the fibres ; for, by the torsion, the external fibres of the&nbsp;bundle will be wound round those that lie nearest to the&nbsp;centre, and, in proportion to their distance from the heart of&nbsp;the bundle, and the amount of twist given, will form spirals&nbsp;more or less inclined from the axis of the thread. The external fibres will in consequence be longer than tile internal&nbsp;ones, and the greatest share of the strain will be borne by&nbsp;the latter. Further, by the operation of twisting, the fibres&nbsp;in a thread are strained, and, on account of their position, the&nbsp;external ones the most. It is of importance to consider&nbsp;the proper length of the primary fibres, and the degree of torsion that ought to be given in forming them into a thread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All threads require the fibres to be so fine, and of such a length, that the quantity of fibres used, and the number of&nbsp;turns each has round its axis, shall be so great as to produce the necessary compression amongst them, to prevent&nbsp;them from sliding upon each other. If the thread be small,&nbsp;the fibres must be fine, and may be short ; and if the thread&nbsp;be large, then must the fibres be long. If the fibres be long&nbsp;in proportion to the size of thread to be made from them,&nbsp;less twisting will obviously be necessary to keep them from&nbsp;sliding ; and the finer and softer the fibres are, the more&nbsp;may the twist be diminished ; for soft fibres enter into&nbsp;closer combination with each other than those that are&nbsp;hard. Long fibres requiring thus less twist than short ones,&nbsp;it has been a standing rule with all theoretical writers, that&nbsp;fibres should always be spun into the thread endlong, and&nbsp;never by their bight or double. Now, in the practice of&nbsp;hand-spinning, the fibres are always spun into the thread by&nbsp;their bights, and never by their ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is certainly an advantage in threads which are to be used merely&nbsp;as such, to secure as great a length&nbsp;of fibre as possible, as any strain tends&nbsp;directly to pull the fibres asunder ;&nbsp;and they are retained in their position merely by the compression among&nbsp;the co-fibres, produced by twisting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But many threads are combined in forming strands ; new forces are&nbsp;brought into action, and so at every&nbsp;further combination. This will be&nbsp;better explained by the following diagram. Let </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">αa</span><span class="font1"> be the primary fibres,&nbsp;formed into threads </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b ;</span><span class="font1"> in each thread&nbsp;the fibres are retained in their position by the compression produced by&nbsp;twisting. Let </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bb</span><span class="font1"> be threads twisted&nbsp;together to form a strand. Here the&nbsp;threads mutually compress each other,&nbsp;and the primary fibres of each thread&nbsp;are compressed by the surrounding&nbsp;threads. Let </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cc</span><span class="font1"> be strands twisted to&nbsp;form a hawser-laid rope. In this the&nbsp;compression on the primary fibres is again increased, and&nbsp;so in the next combination, where the three hawser-laid ropes&nbsp;are twisted into the cable-rope </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We may from this deduce, that it is not the length so much as the intrinsic strength of the fibre which fits it for&nbsp;the purpose of the rope-maker ; and practice perfectly fixes&nbsp;this position, the ropes made from the short waste fibre of&nbsp;the hemp called tow being by no means so weak when&nbsp;compared with those made from the hemp itself, as theory&nbsp;would lead us to suppose, seeing that these fibres are the&nbsp;shortest and weakest of the material. It may therefore be&nbsp;laid down as a rule, that in the making of ropes it is of&nbsp;greater consequence that the fibres should be strong, soft,&nbsp;and finely hackled, than that they should be of great length.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let us consider a little more how the twist of the thread is affected by its future combination. The fibres are first&nbsp;twisted in a certain direction to form threads. A collection&nbsp;of these threads is then twisted together to form a strand ;&nbsp;and this last twist being in a direction contrary to that of&nbsp;the threads, untwists them to a certain extent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Had the twist in the first instance been no more than would just have kept the fibres from sliding upon each other,&nbsp;it would now be inadequate to produce that effect. Hence&nbsp;one would think it necessary to provide means to put more&nbsp;twist into the threads as they were being formed into&nbsp;strands, or to put as much more twist into the threads&nbsp;while spinning, as the twisting of the strands abstracts from&nbsp;them ; but when these strands are combined to form a&nbsp;hawser-laid rope, the direction of the twist is again the same&nbsp;as that of the threads, and restores to them a certain portion&nbsp;of what they had lost. If, however, three of these hawser-laid ropes are formed into a cable-laid rope, the threads are</span></p>
