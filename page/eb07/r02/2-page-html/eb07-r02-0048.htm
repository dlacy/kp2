<p><span class="font1">letting it work its own way gradually to the sides, he thinks every way reprehensible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The objection to a very convex road is, that travellers only use the middle of it, which is therefore worn into&nbsp;three furrows by the string of horses and by the wheels ; if&nbsp;the road is flatter, it becomes worn more equally. Ditches,&nbsp;he observes, only require to be so deep that the surface of&nbsp;the water in them may be a few inches below the level of&nbsp;the road ; the farmer often makes them dangerously deep,&nbsp;on account of the value of the mould that is dug out of&nbsp;them. Mr Macadam would prefer a bog to any other foundation for a road, provided that it would allow a man to&nbsp;walk over it; and he justly observes, that the resistance to&nbsp;the motion of a carriage would not be materially affected&nbsp;by the foundation, if the road were well made. From&nbsp;Bridgewater to Cross, a part of the road shakes when a carriage passes over it ; yet the consumption of materials is less&nbsp;there than on the limestone rock in the neighbourhood.&nbsp;He does not use any faggots in such cases, nor any stones&nbsp;larger than six ounces in weight ; and these never sink in&nbsp;the bog, but unite into one mass like a piece of timber,&nbsp;which rests on it. He makes such a road generally at&nbsp;three different times ; and he always prefers working in&nbsp;weather not very dry. The surveyors are directed to carry&nbsp;a pair of scales and a six-ounce weight in their pockets, as&nbsp;a check upon the workmen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mr Macadam has generally found reason to approve the usual regulation respecting carriage-wheels ; but he thinks&nbsp;broad wheels less advantageous to roads than is commonly&nbsp;supposed. He suggests that the tolls might always be fairly&nbsp;made proportional to the exact number of horses employed ;&nbsp;except that the waggoners should be encouraged to harness&nbsp;them in pairs rather than in a line. The conical form of&nbsp;broad wheels he thinks very injurious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Clean flints from the sea-side are among the best materials for roads, and might often be procured cheap by canals ; granite chippings also, brought as ballast, are excellent; and when the middle of the road has been well made with good stones, the sides may often be left for a few feet&nbsp;less abundantly provided with them, as they are naturally&nbsp;much less exposed to wear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of the other evidence produced to the committee of the House of Commons, there is much that gives us valuable&nbsp;information respecting the economy of horses and carriages&nbsp;in general, and some that deserves to be noticed, as affording partial exceptions to the universal adoption of the system introduced by Mr Macadam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mr Waterhouse observes (p. 85), that stage-coach horses generally last about four years in the neighbourhood of&nbsp;London, and about six in remoter parts. He agrees with&nbsp;Mr Macadam, that a very slight convexity is better for a&nbsp;road than a greater ; that roads in wet situations often require underdraining; and that the gravel near London is&nbsp;too often uscd without being sufficiently cleaned. Mr&nbsp;Horne’s horses generally wear out in about three years.&nbsp;The “ light” coaches, with their loads, generally weigh about&nbsp;two tons and a half ; the coach one, the passengers one, and&nbsp;the luggage a half. The Uxbridge road, he says, is generally heavy, because it lies lower than the neighbouring land,&nbsp;and is not sufficiently drained. Mr Fames reports that the&nbsp;Guildford road is so much improved by the introduction of&nbsp;flints instead of gravel, that sixteen miles are as easily performed on it by his horses as twelve were before the alteration. Mr Farey explains the principle upon which some&nbsp;of the roads about London are watered in winter ; it is in&nbsp;order to soften the tenacious mud that is formed upon the&nbsp;surface, to prevent its adhering to the carriage-wheels, and&nbsp;to enable it to be scraped off with ease. He says that&nbsp;about Whitechapel it has been found very advantageous&nbsp;for the heavy traffic to have the middle of the road paved ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font1">he thinks tllat two lines of pavement, one on each side,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">would be preferable to a single one, in order that the waggoners might walk' at the sides of the road, leaving the middle for lighter carriages. He would have a road fifty-five feet wide, elevated about twelve inches in the middle.&nbsp;Broad wheels, he thinks, are seldom so flat as to bear on their&nbsp;whole surface at once, being commonly rather conoidal&nbsp;than conical ; so that they differ less in their effect from&nbsp;narrower wheels than is commonly supposed. Mr Walker&nbsp;adheres to the old opinion, that in soft soils a road ought to&nbsp;be founded on bushes or “ bavins ;” that is, where they can&nbsp;be expected to remain always wet, so as not to be liable to&nbsp;a very speedy decay. He observes, that if a road does not&nbsp;possess some considerable convexity at first, it will wear&nbsp;concave, and collect mud ; the elevation, he thinks, should&nbsp;be about one thirtieth of the breadth. Mr Telford informs&nbsp;the committee (p. 188) that the declivity of the Welsh roads&nbsp;was formerly in many places one inch in ten ; and in some&nbsp;one in eight, and even one in six ; but that the modem&nbsp;road scarcely ever rises above an inch in thirty ; and that&nbsp;the utmost ascent in the whole line is one in seventeen for&nbsp;about two hundred yards. With respect to the weight of&nbsp;the stones, he agrees with Mr Macadam, that they ought&nbsp;not to exceed six or eight ounces ; and that gravel is best&nbsp;cleaned by riddling it repeatedly, and leaving it to dry in&nbsp;the intervals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sect.</span><span class="font0"> III.—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Of the Roads of different Ages and Countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Romans appear to have been beyond comparison the greatest road-makers of the ancient or the modern world.&nbsp;The story told by Montaigne (iii. vi. p. 206) of a road in&nbsp;Peru, from Quito to Cuzco, 300 leagues long and twenty-five paces broad, made of stones ten feet square, with a running stream and a row of trees on each side, seems to have&nbsp;been considerably exaggerated ; and it is not very clear&nbsp;whether the stones he mentions were used for the road or&nbsp;for the houses of entertainment built at intervals by its side ;&nbsp;nor have the “ rocks cut through” and “ mountains levelled”&nbsp;been very particularly noticed by more recent travellers in&nbsp;that country. In Italy only, the Romans are said to have&nbsp;made more than 14,000 miles of road, w hich was generally&nbsp;executed with great care and labour ; and many of their&nbsp;roads still remain as the foundation of the most favourite&nbsp;routes of Italian travellers. The more than Roman despot&nbsp;of modern times was as much a Roman in his road-making&nbsp;as in the selfish character of his general policy ; and in proportion to the duration of his dynasty, he performed more&nbsp;than all the Appii and Flaminii of antiquity. Whatever&nbsp;his merits may have been, the beneficial effects of his measures remain ; and those who have profited by his improvements have no right to criticise his motives with too great&nbsp;severity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of the great roads diverging from the gates of ancient Rome, about twelve have been enumerated by antiquaries,&nbsp;and twelve more branched off from these at a small distance&nbsp;from the city ; eighteen others commenced in different&nbsp;parts of Italy, and in the whole there are at least fifty, which&nbsp;have been distinguished by appropriate names, without including the military roads through the distant provinces;&nbsp;such, for example, as in England were distinguished by the&nbsp;name of streets, of which many traces yet remain in different parts of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Directly to the sea the Romans travelled by the Ostian road ; along its shores to the north-west by the Aurelian,&nbsp;and to the south-east by the Appian. Next within the&nbsp;Aurelian was the Flaminian, then the Salarian, the Nomen-tanian, the Tiburtine, the Prænestine, the Lavican, and&nbsp;the Latin ; and then the Appian, which was the most ancient of all, having been made as far as Capua, in the 442d&nbsp;year of the city, accompanied to a considerable distance by&nbsp;an aqueduct. The Aurelian road was made in the year&nbsp;512 ; the Flaminian about 533.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
