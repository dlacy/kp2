<p><span class="font1">green leaves of plants. But the same solar radiation, when broken up into diffused sky light, which has no definite direction,&nbsp;has fallen into equilibrium with a much lower temperature,&nbsp;through loss of its reversibility. It has been remarked that the&nbsp;temperatures of the planets can be roughly compared by means&nbsp;of this principle, if their coefficients of absorption of the solar&nbsp;radiation are assumed; that of Neptune comes out below&nbsp;— 200° C., if we suppose that it is not kept higher by a supply&nbsp;of internal heat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To obtain dynamical precision in this discussion an exact definition of the narrow beam such as is usually called a ray is&nbsp;essential. It can be specified as a narrow filament of radiation,&nbsp;such as may be isolated within an infinitely thin, impermeable,&nbsp;bounding tube without thereby producing any disturbance of&nbsp;the motion. If either the tube or the surrounding radiation&nbsp;were not present to keep the beam in shape, it would spread&nbsp;sideways, as in optical diffraction. But the function of the&nbsp;tube is one of pure constraint; thus the change of energy-content of a given length of the tube is represented by energy&nbsp;flowing into it at the end where the radiation enters, and leaving&nbsp;it at the other end, but with no leakage at the sides. The total&nbsp;radiation may be considered as made up of such filaments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">9.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Temperature of the Sun. —</span><span class="font1">The mean temperature of the&nbsp;radiating layers of the Sun may be estimated from Stefan’s law,&nbsp;by computing the intensity of the radiation at his surface&nbsp;from that terrestrially observed, on the basis of the law of&nbsp;inverse squares; the result is about 6500° C. The application&nbsp;of Wien’s law, which makes the wave-length of maximum&nbsp;energy vary inversely as the temperature, for the case of a&nbsp;perfectly radiating source, gives a result 5500<sup>0</sup> C. These numbers&nbsp;will naturally differ because (i) the Sun is not a perfect radiator,&nbsp;the constitution of his radiation in fact not following the law&nbsp;of that of a black body, (ii) the various radiating layers have&nbsp;different temperatures, (iii) the radiation may be in part due&nbsp;to chemical and electrical causes, and in so far would not&nbsp;be determined by the temperature alone. The fair agreement&nbsp;of these two estimates indicates, however, that the radiation&nbsp;is largely regulated by the temperature, that the layers from&nbsp;which the main part of it comes are at temperatures not very&nbsp;different, and that not very much of the complete radiation&nbsp;established in these layers and emitted from them is absorbed&nbsp;by the overlying layers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">10.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fluorescence. —</span><span class="font1">When radiation of certain wave-lengths&nbsp;falls on a fluorescent body, it is largely absorbed, but in such&nbsp;manner as directly to excite other radiation of different type&nbsp;which is emitted in addition to the true temperature-radiation&nbsp;of the body. The distinction involved is that the latter radiation is spontaneously convertible with the heat of the absorbing&nbsp;body at its own temperature, without any external stimulus&nbsp;or compensation; it is, in fact, on the basis of this convertibility&nbsp;that the thermodynamic relations of the temperature-radiation&nbsp;have been established. According to the experimental law of&nbsp;Stokes, the wave-lengths of the fluorescent radiation are longer&nbsp;than those of the radiation which excites it. If the latter&nbsp;were directly transformed, in undiminished amount, into the&nbsp;fluorescent kind, this is what would be expected. For such&nbsp;a spontaneous change must involve loss of availability; and,&nbsp;beyond the wave-length of maximum energy in the spectrum,&nbsp;the temperature of a given density of radiation is greater the&nbsp;shorter its wave-length, as it is a function of that density and&nbsp;the wave-length alone such that greater radiation always&nbsp;corresponds to higher temperature. But it would appear that&nbsp;the opposite should be the case for radiation of long wave-lengths, lying on the other side of the maximum, in which the&nbsp;tendency would thus be for spontaneous change into shorter&nbsp;waves; this may perhaps be related to the fact that the lines&nbsp;of longer wave-lengths in spectra often come out brighter at&nbsp;lower temperatures, for they are then thrown on the other side&nbsp;of the maximum and cannot be thus degraded. The principle&nbsp;does not, however, have free play in the present case, even&nbsp;when the incident radiation is diffused and so has not the&nbsp;abnormally high temperature associated with a directed beam&nbsp;(§ 8), since part of it might be degraded into low-temperature&nbsp;heat, or there might be other compensation of chemical type&nbsp;for any abnormally high availability that might exist in the&nbsp;fluorescent radiation. It has been found that fluorescent&nbsp;radiation, showing a continuous or banded spectrum, can be&nbsp;excited in many gases and vapours; milky phosphorescence&nbsp;of considerable duration, and thus doubtless associated with&nbsp;chemical change, is produced in vacuum tubes, containing&nbsp;oxygen or other complexly constituted gases, by the electric&nbsp;discharge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">11.  </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Entropy of a Ray. —</span><span class="font1">If each definitely constituted beam&nbsp;of radiation has its own temperature and everything is reversible as above, a question arises as to the location of the process&nbsp;of averaging which enters into the idea of temperature. The&nbsp;answer can depend only on the fact, that although the beam is&nbsp;definite as to wave-length and intensity, yet it is far from being&nbsp;a simple wave-train, in that it is constituted of trains of limited&nbsp;lengths and various phases and polarizations, coming from the&nbsp;independent radiating molecules. When such a beam has&nbsp;once emerged, it travels without change, and can be reflected&nbsp;back intact to its source, and is in so far reversible; but when&nbsp;it has arrived there, the molecules of the source will have&nbsp;changed their positions, and it cannot be wholly reabsorbed&nbsp;in the same manner as it was emitted. There must thus be&nbsp;some feature in the ultimate averaged constitution of the beam,&nbsp;emitted from a body in the definite steady state of internal&nbsp;motion determined by its temperature, which adapts it for&nbsp;spontaneous uncompensated reabsorption into </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font1">body at its&nbsp;own (or a lower) temperature, but not at a higher one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The question of the determination of the form of the function ϕ in § 6 would thus appear to be closely connected with the&nbsp;other problems, hitherto imperfectly fathomed, relating to&nbsp;the statistics of kinetic molecular theory. A very interesting&nbsp;attack on the problem from this point of view has recently&nbsp;been made in various forms by Planck. It of course suffices&nbsp;to examine some simple type of radiating system, and the&nbsp;results will be of general validity. He considers an enclosure&nbsp;filled with radiation involving an entirely arbitrary succession&nbsp;of phases and polarizations along each ray, and also containing&nbsp;a system of fixed linear electric oscillators of the Hertzian&nbsp;type, which are taken to represent the transforming action of&nbsp;radiating and absorbing matter. The radiation contained in&nbsp;the enclosure will be passed through these oscillators over and&nbsp;over again, now absorbed, now radiated, and each constituent&nbsp;will thus settle down in a unilateral or irreversible manner&nbsp;towards some definite intensity and composition. But it&nbsp;does not appear that a system of vibrators of this kind, each&nbsp;with its own period, can perform one of the main functions of&nbsp;a material absorber, namely, the transformation of the relative&nbsp;intensities of the various types of radiation in the enclosure&nbsp;to those corresponding to a common temperature. There&nbsp;would be equilibrium established only between the mean&nbsp;internal vibratory energy in the vibrators of each period and&nbsp;the density of radiation of that period; there is needed also&nbsp;some means of interchanging energy between vibrators of&nbsp;different periods, which probably involves doing away with&nbsp;their fixity, or else employing more complex vibrators and&nbsp;assuming a law of distribution of their internal energy. In the&nbsp;absence of any method of introducing this temperature equilibrium directly, Planck originally sought, in the case of each&nbsp;independent constituent, for a function of its intensity of&nbsp;energy and its wave-length, restricted as to form by a certain&nbsp;assumed molecular relation, which has the property of continually increasing after the manner of entropy, during the progress&nbsp;of that constituent of the radiation in such a system towards&nbsp;its steady state. If the actual entropy S per unit volume&nbsp;could be thus determined, the relation of Clausius δS=δE∕T&nbsp;would supply the connexion between the temperature and the&nbsp;density of radiant energy E. This procedure led him, in an&nbsp;indirect and tentative manner, to a relation </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup>S∕dE<sup>2</sup> = -</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1">∕E, so&nbsp;that S = -</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1">E log</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">β</span><span class="font1">E, where </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font1"> are functions of λ; an expression&nbsp;which conducts through Clausius’s relation to E = (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">eβ</span><span class="font1">)<sup>-1</sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font1"><sup>-1</sup>∕ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>a</sup></span><span class="font1">τ.</span></p>
