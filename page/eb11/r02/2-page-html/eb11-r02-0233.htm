By means of a&nbsp;tunnel about 2100 yds. long water is obtained for the greater part of&nbsp;the main valley from the lake of Llyn Fawr on the Neath side of the&nbsp;mountain range which shuts in the valley on the north. This lake has&nbsp;been converted into a storage reservoir of about 167 million gallons&nbsp;capacity. The rest </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">the district is supplied from the Pontypridd&nbsp;Water Company’s works above Maerdy in the lesser valley.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The ancient parish (excluding Rhigos) was formed into a parliamentary constituency with one member in 1885. The&nbsp;present urban district substantially corresponds to the ancient&nbsp;territorial division of Glyn-rhondda, one of the four commotes of&nbsp;the cantred of Penychen, and subsequently, in Norman times, one&nbsp;of the twelve “ members ” of the lordship of Glamorgan. Its&nbsp;Welsh lords enjoyed a large measure of independence and had&nbsp;their own courts, in which Welsh law was administered down to&nbsp;1535, when the lordship was fully incorporated in the county of&nbsp;Glamorgan. On the ridge of Cefn-rhondda between the two&nbsp;valleys was the Franciscan monastery of Penrhys, famous for&nbsp;its image of the Virgin and for its holy well which attracted&nbsp;large pilgrimages. It was dissolved about 1415, probably owing&nbsp;to its having supported Glyndwr in his rebellion. Edward II.&nbsp;came here from Neath Abbey and was captured on the 16th&nbsp;of November 1326, either at Penrhys, or between it and&nbsp;Llantrisant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ll.</span><span class="font2"> T.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RHONE (Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rhone,</span><span class="font2"> Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rhodanus),</span><span class="font2"> one of the most important rivers in Europe, and the chief of those which flow directly into&nbsp;the Mediterranean. It rises at the upper or eastern extremity&nbsp;of the Swiss canton of the Valais, flows between the Bernese&nbsp;Alps (N.) and the Lepontine and Pennine Alps (S.) till it expands&nbsp;into the Lake of Geneva, winds round the southernmost spurs&nbsp;of the Jura range, receives at Lyons its principal tributary, the&nbsp;Saône, and then turns southward through France till, by many&nbsp;mouths, it enters that part of the Mediterranean which is rightly&nbsp;called the Golfe du Lion (sometimes wrongly the Gulf of Lyons).&nbsp;Its total length from source to sea is 504! m. (of which the Lake&nbsp;of Geneva claims 45 m.), while its total drainage area in 37,798&nbsp;sq. m., of which 2772 sq. m. are in Switzerland (405 sq. m. of&nbsp;the Swiss portion being composed of glaciers), and its total fall&nbsp;5898 ft. Its course (excluding the Lake of Geneva, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q.v.)</span><span class="font2"> naturally&nbsp;falls into three divisions: (1) from its source to the Lake of&nbsp;Geneva, (2) from Geneva to Lyons, and (3) from Lyons to&nbsp;the Mediterranean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I. From its source to the lake the Rhone is a purely Alpine&nbsp;river, flowing through the great trench which it has cut for&nbsp;itself between two of the loftiest Alpine ranges, and which (save&nbsp;a bit at its north-west end) forms the Canton of the Valais.&nbsp;Its length is 105J m., while its fall is 4679 ft. It issues as a&nbsp;torrent, at the height of 5909 ft., from the great Rhone glacier&nbsp;at the head of the Valais, the recent retreat of this glacier having&nbsp;proved that the river really flows from beneath it, and does not&nbsp;take its rise from the warm springs that are now at some distance&nbsp;from its shrunken snout. It is almost immediately joined on&nbsp;the left by the Mutt torrent, coming from a small glacier to&nbsp;the S.E., and then flows S.W. for a short distance past the&nbsp;well-known Gletsch Hotel (where the roads from the Grimsel&nbsp;and the Furka Passes unite). But about half a mile from the&nbsp;glacier the river turns S.E. and descends through a wild gorge&nbsp;to the more level valley, bending again S.W. before reaching&nbsp;the first village, Oberwald. It preserves this south-westerly&nbsp;direction till Martigny.- The uppermost valley of the Rhone&nbsp;is named Goms (Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Conches),</span><span class="font2"> its chief village being Münster,&nbsp;while Fiesch, lower down, is well known to most Swiss travellers.&nbsp;As the river rolls on, it is swollen by mountain torrents, descending from the glaciers on either side of its bed—so by the Geren&nbsp;(left), near Oberwald, by the Eginen (left), near Ulrichen, by&nbsp;the Fiesch (right), at Fiesch<sub>1</sub> by the Binna (left), near Grengiols,&nbsp;by the Massa (right), flowing from the great Aletsch glaciers,&nbsp;above Brieg. At Brieg the Rhone has descended 3678 ft. from&nbsp;its source, has flowed 28 m. in the open, and is already a considerable stream when joined (left)by the Saltine, descending from&nbsp;the Simplon Pass. Its course below Brieg is less rapid than&nbsp;before and lies through the alluvial deposits which it has brought&nbsp;down in the course of ages. The valley is wide and marshy,&nbsp;the river frequently overflowing its banks. Further mountain&nbsp;torrents (of greater volume than those higher up) fall into the&nbsp;Rhone as it rolls along in a south-westerly direction towards&nbsp;Martigny: the Visp (left), coming from the Zermatt valley,&nbsp;falls in at Visp, at Gampel the Lonza (right), from the Lötschen&nbsp;valley, at Leuk the Dala (right), from the Gemmi Pass, at&nbsp;Sierrc the Navizen (left), from the Einfisch or Anniviers&nbsp;valley, at Sion, the capital of the Valais, the Borgne (left)&nbsp;from the Val d’Hérens; soon* the Rhone is joined by the Morge&nbsp;(right), flowing from the Sanetsch Pass, and the boundary in&nbsp;the middle ages between Episcopal Valais to the east and Savoyard Valais to the west, and at Martigny by the Dranse (left),&nbsp;its chief Alpine tributary, from the Great St Bernard and the&nbsp;Val de Bagnes. At Martigny, about 50 m. from Brieg, the&nbsp;river bends sharply to the N.W., and runs in that direction to&nbsp;the Lake of Geneva. It receives the Salanfe (left), which forms&nbsp;the celebrated waterfall of Pissevache, before reaching the&nbsp;ancient town and abbey of St Maurice (9 Jm.). Henceforward&nbsp;the right bank is in the canton of Vaud (conquered from Savoy&nbsp;in 1475) and the left bank in that of the Valais (conquered&nbsp;similarly in 1536), for St Maurice marks the end of the historical&nbsp;Valais. Immediately below that town the Rhone rushes through&nbsp;a great natural gateway, a narrow and striking defile (now&nbsp;strongly fortified), which commands the entrance of the Valais.&nbsp;Beyond, the river enters the wide alluvial plain, formerly&nbsp;occupied by the south-eastern arm of the Lake of Geneva,&nbsp;but now marshy and requiring frequent V correction.” * It&nbsp;receives at Bex the Avançon (right), flowing from the glaciers&nbsp;of the Diablerets range, at Monthey the Vieze (left), from&nbsp;Champéry and the Val dTlliez, and at Aigle the Grande Eau&nbsp;(right), from the valley of Ormonts-dessus. It passes by the&nbsp;hamlet of Port Valais, once on the shore of the lake, before&nbsp;expanding into the Lake of Geneva, between Villeneuve (right)&nbsp;and St Gingolph (left). During all this portion of its course&nbsp;the Rhone is not navigable, but a railway line runs along it&nbsp;from Brieg in about 72 m. to either Villeneuve or Le Bouveret.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2. On issuing at Geneva from the lake the waters of the&nbsp;Rhone are very limpid and blue, as it has left all its impurities&nbsp;in the great settling vat of the lake, so that Byron might well&nbsp;speak of the “ blue rushing of the arrowy Rhone ” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Childe Harold,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">canto iii. stanza 71). But about half a mile below Geneva this&nbsp;limpidity is disturbed by the pouring in of the· turbid torrent&nbsp;of the Arve (left), descending from the glaciers of the MontBlanc&nbsp;range, the two currents for some distance refusing to mix. The&nbsp;distance from Geneva to Lyons by the tortuous course of the&nbsp;Rhone is about 124 m., the fall being only about 689 ft. The&nbsp;characteristic feature of this portion of the course of the Rhone&nbsp;is the number of narrow gorges or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cluses</span><span class="font2"> through which it rushes,&nbsp;while it is forced by the southern spur of the Jura to run in a&nbsp;southerly direction, till, after rounding the base of that spur,&nbsp;it can flow freely westwards to Lyons. About 12 m. S. of&nbsp;Geneva the Rhone enters French territory, and henceforth till&nbsp;near Lyons forms first the eastern, then the southern boundary&nbsp;of the French department of the Ain, dividing it from those of&nbsp;Haute Savoie and Savoie (E.) and that of the Isère (S.). Soon&nbsp;after it becomes French the river rushes furiously through a&nbsp;deep gorge, being imprisoned on the north by the Crédo and on&nbsp;the south by the Vuache, while the great fortress of l’Écluse&nbsp;guards this entrance into France. The railway pierces the&nbsp;Credo by a tunnel. In the narrowest portion of this gorge,&nbsp;not far from Bellegarde at its lower end, there formerly existed&nbsp;the famous </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Perte du Rhône</span><span class="font2"> (described by Saussure in his&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Voyages dans Us Alpes,</span><span class="font2"> chapter xvii.), where for a certain&nbsp;distance the river disappeared in a subterranean channel;&nbsp;but this natural phenomenon has been destroyed, partly by&nbsp;blasting, and partly by the diversion of the water for thé use&nbsp;of the factories of Bellegarde. At Bellegarde the’Valserinc&nbsp;flows in (right), and then the river resumes its southerly direction,&nbsp;from which the great gorge had deflected it for a while.
