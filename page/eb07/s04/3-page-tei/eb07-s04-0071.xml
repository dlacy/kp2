The church establishment includes eight archbishops and seventy-two bishops, 2393 canons, and 1869 prebendaries, together with an immense multitude of other ecclesiastics, under various denominations. In the year 1835 there still remained 1940 cloisters, containing 30,906 monks. Of these the Franciscans alone possessed 651 cloisters, with 11,232 monks and lay-brothers. But by a royal decree of the above year, all the religious houses which did not contain more than twelve monks were abolished. The number of monasteries thus condemned amounted to 900. Their revenues were applied to the extinction of the national debt. The whole income of the church is valued at L.12,500,000 sterling, and the portion of the income which is consumed by the spirituality exceeds the collective income of the state by about L.2,000,000.</p><p>&gt;</p><p><hi rend="italic">Education.</hi></p><p>The institutions for public instruction in Spain are the universities of</p><p>Valencia, established in 1411 Students in 1827	1569</p><p>Valladolid	 1346	 1247</p><p>Saragossa	 1474	 1175</p><p>Santiago...,.	 1532 	,	1054</p><p>Seville	 1504	  807</p><p>Granada	 1531	  812</p><p>Cervera	 1717	  573</p><p>Huesca	 1354	  537</p><p>Oviedo	 1580	  420</p><p>Salamanca	 1404	   418</p><p>Alcala.	 1490	  364</p><p>Onate	 270</p><p>Toledo	 257</p><p>Palma	 177</p><p>Orihuela	 124</p><p>There are two artillery schools, and a hundred and sixty three colleges and seminaries of a higher order, containing 3810 pupils. The common schools throughout the country have been estimated at about 20,000.</p><p>There are numerous public libraries in the more important towns, some of them of considerable extent. One at Madrid contains about 130,000 volumes, numerous manu scripts, and a rich collection of medals. The prohibition, however, of many standard works greatly limits their value.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Finances.</hi></p><p>According to the budget of 11th February 1837, the</p><p>expenditure amounted to	1,929,300,795 reals.</p><p>The income to	800,000,000 ditto.</p><p>With regard to the national debt of Spain it is impossible to obtain any thing like a correct estimate. For the last eight or nine years it has continued to accumulate with fearful rapidity, and loan after loan has been negociated. It seems almost impossible that so large an amount as from two millions to two millions and a half sterling, can be annually collected to pay the interest of the national debt in a country already grievously oppressed with taxes, and where trade is in some measure stagnant. The balance of her trade, ever since the loss of her colonies, has been in the ratio of two to one against Spain, while the whole value of her exportable produce, even in the most prosperous periods, has not exceeded three millions and a half ; and this is now supposed to be greatly reduced, since the exports to Eng 1and, which is the greatest consumer of her fruits, wine, and wool, have barely averaged for the last four or five years one million sterling. In 1833, the public debts amounted to L.165,000,000, and as the expenditure exceeded the income, and various loans have since been nego ciated, it has now materially increased. Taxation in Spain is very heavy, and is levied with little regard to the well</p></body></text></TEI>
