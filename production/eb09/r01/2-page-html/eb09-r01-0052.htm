<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Gauge.—</span><span class="font5">The measure of the standard or British national gauge of railways is 4 feet 8⅛ inches of width between the rails forming a&nbsp;line of rails or a way. There are many other gauges in existence&nbsp;in different parts of the world. In England the gauge of 7 feet,&nbsp;originally adopted on the Great Western Railway, was known as&nbsp;the “broad gauge” in contradistinction to the ordinary gauge of&nbsp;4 feet 8⅜ inches, which was for a long time known as the “ narrow&nbsp;gauge.” But the 7 feet gauge has been to a great extent replaced&nbsp;by the 4 feet 8⅜ inch or national gauge, and it is being gradually&nbsp;replaced altogether. The lengths of line now (1885) laid on the two&nbsp;gauges on the Great Western Railway are as follows :—</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The name of ‘<sup>,</sup> narrow gauge ” has now ceased to be applicable to the standard gauge, and is reserved for gauges of much less width,—&nbsp;the metre gauge and others of from 2 to 3 or 3⅜ feet wide. Why a&nbsp;fractional measure of gauge should have been selected is a question&nbsp;which has puzzled many people. The fact seems to be that the&nbsp;track of the original carts or trains—5 feet wide outside the wheels—&nbsp;was taken as a standard for the gauge of rails, which was measured&nbsp;outside also. The width of the single rail at the top being originally&nbsp;1 j inches, the width for the two rails together is 3⅜ inches, which&nbsp;leaves 4 feet 8⅜ inches for the inside measure or true gauge. There&nbsp;are in the United Kingdom a few railways of gauge narrower than&nbsp;the standard gauge, of which instances occur in the following&nbsp;lines :—Festiniog, 1 foot 11⅛ inches ; Talyllyn, 2 feet 6 inches ;&nbsp;Dinas and Snowdon, Southwold, Isle of Man, Manx Northern,&nbsp;Ravenglass and Eskdale, Ballymena and Larne, each 3 feet.

<p><span class="font5">The relative advantages of broad gauges and narrow gauges were exhaustively discussed at the Institution of Civil Engineers (in&nbsp;1873), on the reading of Mr W. T. Thornton’s paper on “ The&nbsp;Relative Advantages of the 5 feet 6 inch Gauge and of the Metre&nbsp;Gauge for the State Railways of India. ” The fallacy pervading the&nbsp;arguments for narrow gauges is that they take the width between&nbsp;the rails as the basic unit of the system ; whereas that is really&nbsp;little more than an incident, and the dimensions of the railway&nbsp;must in point of fact be governed by the size and weight of the&nbsp;vehicles which the traffic requires. Speaking generally, the&nbsp;national gauge of 4 feet 8.) inches is at least as good as any&nbsp;other for the purposes of general traffic. If the width of gauge&nbsp;were still an open question, it might be maintained that a gauge&nbsp;of 5 feet would be rather more convenient in view of the increasing&nbsp;size of the more powerful locomotives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rails.—</span><span class="font5">“The experience of the last twenty-five years,” said Mr George Parker Bidder, speaking in 1861, “has shown that one&nbsp;system has been adopted almost universally—the double-headed&nbsp;rails, upon chairs with cross sleepers, a plan which has been&nbsp;materially improved by fishing the joints.” On the continent of&nbsp;Europe and in America, however, engineers have almost universally&nbsp;laid the flat-foot or flange rail ; and in France double-headed rails,&nbsp;keyed in chairs, have been replaced by flange rails. On the Metropolitan and Metropolitan District Railways, on the contrary, the&nbsp;flange rails have been taken up and replaced by double-headed rails&nbsp;in chairs. The case may be briefly stated in the following terms.&nbsp;The double-headed rail system with chairs is the best where supplies of material and labour for maintenance and repair are always&nbsp;ready and available. The single-headed flange rail system is the&nbsp;best when the main thing to attain is simplicity in construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Steel rails are now very generally used instead of iron ; and indeed it may be affirmed that but for the introduction of that material&nbsp;for rails and also for the wheel tires of locomotives the railway&nbsp;system would have broken down under the enormous growth of&nbsp;traffic. Rails of wrought-iron on the early railways lasted about&nbsp;twenty-five years ; those of later date have been worn out in from&nbsp;five to ten years and in certain situations in twelve months, mainly&nbsp;owing to increased traffic, heavier loads on the engine-wheels, increased speed, quicker stopping and quicker starting. Steel has&nbsp;come to the rescue both in the engine-wheels and in the rails.&nbsp;Loads of from 15 to 18 tons are now placed with impunity on the&nbsp;single wheels of engines as well as on coupled wheels, while it&nbsp;appears from the investigations of Mr R. Price Williams, a leading&nbsp;authority on permanent way, that a fully proportioned bull-headed&nbsp;rail of steel outlasts fifteen or eighteen iron rails. Steel rails are&nbsp;not merely stronger or harder but, owing to their texture, are worn&nbsp;away only by simple abrasion, whereas iron rails separate out into&nbsp;strands as soon as the outer coating that binds them together is&nbsp;worn off. Mr Alfred A. Langley laid down in 1874 samples of&nbsp;permanent way near Stepney station on the London and Blackwall&nbsp;Railway, where upwards of 300 trains a day passed over a single line&nbsp;of way. The weight of each train was on an average about 150 tons,&nbsp;making a total of about 45,000 tons daily over one line of rails.&nbsp;The rails are both of steel and of iron, weighing 80 lb per lineal&nbsp;yard and keyed in cast-iron chairs on cross rectangular sleepers.&nbsp;The greater number of the w<sup>τ</sup>rought-iron rails had to be turned&nbsp;after one year and three-quarters, during which period they had&nbsp;worn down about one-eighth of an inch ; but the necessity for reversing did not arise from the wear itself, but because they gave&nbsp;way in places, either bulging or splitting. The steel rails had&nbsp;worn about one-sixteenth of an inch in the same period. About&nbsp;27,000,000 tons had passed over the line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The rails generally, indeed almost universally, used for the way of railways are the double-headed, the bull-headed, and the flange&nbsp;or Vignoles rails (in the United States, Germany, Canada, and&nbsp;Mexico), the double-headed and the bull-headed rails being keyed&nbsp;into cast-iron chairs spiked to sleepers, the flanged being laid upon&nbsp;and fastened direct to the sleepers. The principal advantage of&nbsp;the flange rail is the facility with which it can be attached to the&nbsp;sleeper with fastenings of a simple description. The disadvantages&nbsp;are that it cannot be turned or reversed when the head is worn, as&nbsp;the double-headed rail may be, and that the rigid attachment of&nbsp;the rail to the sleeper causes a greater degree of disturbance of&nbsp;the way and involves more labour for maintenance than in the case&nbsp;of the double-headed rail. The double-headed rail is made heavier&nbsp;foτ the same class of traffic than the flange rail ; but it is also&nbsp;stronger and is easily bent to curves, although owing to the mode&nbsp;of attachment to the chairs by wooden keys there is a liability&nbsp;to a slight longitudinal movement of the rails, known as ‘<sup>1</sup> creeping.” The bull-headed rail possesses the advantages of the doubleheaded rail, except that, like the flange rail, it is not reversible.&nbsp;The bull-headed rail is laid on most of the railway lines of England&nbsp;and Scotland ; the double-headed rail is also in use. In Ireland&nbsp;the bull-headed and the flange rails are used. Double-headed and&nbsp;bull-headed rails in English practice are rolled to a weight of from&nbsp;82 to 86 lb per yard ; the heads are made from 2⅜ to 2</span><span class="font2">∣</span><span class="font5"> inches&nbsp;wide ; the webs are from five-eighths to thirteen-sixteenths of an&nbsp;inch in thickness ; and the height of the rail varies from 5</span><span class="font2">∣</span><span class="font5"> to&nbsp;5 j inches. The rails are now made of steel, in bars for the most&nbsp;part 30 feet in length, with the advantage in comparison with&nbsp;shorter lengths of a more solid road, fewer joints, and less cost for&nbsp;maintenance. They are fixed into massive cast-iron chairs, weighing from 31 to 55 lb each, by means of hard wood keys—oak.&nbsp;They are canted inwards in their seats at an angle usually of 1 in&nbsp;20, the better to resist lateral blows from wheels. The chairs are&nbsp;made of considerable width on the more heavily worked lines—&nbsp;from 7 to 8 inches, against a minimum of 4⅜ inches on other lines.&nbsp;On some lines the seats of the chairs on which the rails rest are&nbsp;slightly rounded in the direction of the rail ; this forms a compensation for slight deviations from the level in the sleepers, but is&nbsp;mainly useful in preventing indentation of the rails by the concussions to which they are subject—a matter<sup>-</sup> of importance with&nbsp;double-headed rails which are by and by to be reversed. In such&nbsp;cases Mr T. E. Harrison places cushions of hard wood in the chair&nbsp;to support the rails, which are thus effectually protected from&nbsp;indentation ; and, in addition, the trains run more smoothly.&nbsp;The oak keys by which the rails are fastened in the chairs are&nbsp;generally applied at the outer side of the rail, as the jar caused by&nbsp;the lateral percussion of the flanges of wheels is then less than&nbsp;when the key is placed inside ; but on the Manchester, Sheffield,&nbsp;and Lincolnshire Railway the key is put at the inner side of the&nbsp;rail, and there is this to be said in favour of the practice, that the&nbsp;rails are kept firmly to gauge and the key is less likely to shift.&nbsp;On some railways contrivances are employed to prevent the keys&nbsp;from shifting or creeping out of their proper position in the chair ;&nbsp;these will be noticed in their places. The rails are laid end to&nbsp;end, one-eighth or three-sixteenths of an inch apart at ordinary</span></p>
