<p><span class="font0">foreshore: thus considerable advantage will accrue from placing rows of faggots or sods across the lines of flow; and banks,&nbsp;enclosing the higher portions of the foreshore, may often be&nbsp;constructed so as materially to increase the period of stagnation,&nbsp;near high tide, of the silt-bearing water upon the lower adjacent&nbsp;foreshore. The light, fertilizing alluvium only deposits in&nbsp;shallow water at high tide, and where there arc no tidal currents.&nbsp;The final enclosure, therefore, should not be effected until this&nbsp;deposit has taken place. The enclosing works, also, should be&nbsp;so carried out that increasing shelter may favour the deposits&nbsp;of this alluvium during construction. A final and rapid deposit&nbsp;can sometimes be effected by making sluices in the banks:&nbsp;the turbid water is admitted near high tide, and retained until&nbsp;the whole of its silt has been deposited, the clear water being&nbsp;allowed to escape slowly towards low tide. Premature enclosure&nbsp;must be guarded against; it is more difficult, the cost greater,&nbsp;the reclaimed land is less fertile and, being lower, less easy to&nbsp;drain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The practice of reclaiming land in British estuaries is a very ancient one. The Romans effected reclamations in the Fen&nbsp;districts; the enclosing of Sunk Island in the Humber was&nbsp;begun in the 17th century, and now produces an annual revenue&nbsp;of something like £10,000; large reclamations in the Dee estuary&nbsp;took place in the 18th century; and, in recent times, works&nbsp;have been carried out in the estuaries of the Seine, the Ribble&nbsp;and the Tees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the reclamation of land adjoining the sea-coast, sites where accretion is taking place arc obviously the most suitable.&nbsp;Marsh lands adjoining the sea, and more or less subject to inundation at high tides, can be permanently reclaimed by embankments; but these, unless there is protection from sand dunes or&nbsp;a shingle beach, require to be stronger, higher, with a less steeply&nbsp;inclined and better protected slope than is required in estuaries.&nbsp;The width of the bank will generally prevent percolation of&nbsp;water at the base; but if there is any danger of infiltration,&nbsp;owing to unsuitability of material, a central core of puddled clay&nbsp;or a row of sheet-piling should be employed. Waves over-topping the bank will quickly cause a breach, and produce&nbsp;disastrous results; the height of the bank must, therefore,&nbsp;be calculated to meet the case of the severest on-shore gale&nbsp;coinciding with the highest spring tide. Undermining, caused&nbsp;by the recoil of waves on the beach, is liable to occur in exposed&nbsp;sites; this may be prevented by a line of sheet-piling along the&nbsp;outer toe of the bank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sea-coast embankments should not generally be constructed farther down the foreshore than half-tide level, as the cost of&nbsp;construction and maintenance would increase out of all proportion to the additional area obtained. It is, as a rule, more&nbsp;economical to reclaim a large area at one time, instead of&nbsp;enclosing it gradually in sections, as the cost varies with the&nbsp;length of embankment; it is, however, more difficult to effect&nbsp;the final closing of a bank, where a large area is thus reclaimed,&nbsp;on account of the greater volume of tidal-water flowing in and out&nbsp;of the contracted opening. The final closing of a reclamation&nbsp;embankment is best accomplished by leaving a fairly wide&nbsp;aperture, and by gradually raising a level bank across its entire&nbsp;length. The enclosed area may be left full of water to the height&nbsp;of the unfinished bank, or the tide-water may be allowed to&nbsp;escape and enter again by sluices in the finished sections. The&nbsp;embankments in Holland are closed by sinking long fascine&nbsp;mattresses across the opening; these are weighted with clay&nbsp;and stone, and effectually withstand the scour through the gap;&nbsp;the two terminal slopes of the finished sections are similarly&nbsp;protected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are many examples of sea-coast reclamation: Romney marsh was enclosed long ago by the Dymchurch wall (see fig. 1),&nbsp;and a large portion of Holland has been reclaimed from the sea&nbsp;by embankments (see fig. 2); the reclamation bank for the&nbsp;Hodbarrow iron mines (see fig. 3) illustrates the use of puddled&nbsp;clay to prevent infiltration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The repair of a breach effected in a completed reclamation embankment is a more difficult task than that of closing the&nbsp;final gap during construction; this is owing to the channel&nbsp;or gully scoured out upon the opening of the breach. When a&nbsp;breach occurs which cannot be closed in a single tide, the formation of an over-deep gully may to some extent be prevented&nbsp;by enlarging the opening. Breaches in embankments have been&nbsp;closed by sinking barges across the gap, by piling and planking&nbsp;up, by lowering sliding panels between frames erected to receive&nbsp;them, and by making an inset wall or bank round the breach.&nbsp;By the last-mentioned method the new connecting bank can be&nbsp;formed on solid ground, and the necessary width of opening&nbsp;obtained to obviate excessive scour during the influx and efflux&nbsp;of the tide over the bank while it is being raised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The gradual drying of reclaimed land lowers the surface some two or three feet; the land therefore becomes more liable to&nbsp;inundation after reclamation than before. Accordingly, it is&nbsp;most important to prevent breaching of the bank by promptly&nbsp;repairing any damage caused by storms; and if a breach should&nbsp;occur, it must be closed at the earliest possible opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The protection of the coast-line from encroachment by the sea is a matter of considerable importance and great difficulty:&nbsp;the more rapid the erosion, the more exposed must be the site;&nbsp;and, consequently, the more costly will be the construction and&nbsp;maintenance of protective works. These are of two kinds:&nbsp;sea-walls or banks, and groynes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upright sea-walls with some batter on the face have been constructed along the frontage of many sea-side towns, with&nbsp;the double purpose of making a promenade or drive, and of&nbsp;affording protection to the town. A very sloping and also&nbsp;a curved batter breaks the stroke of the wave by facilitating&nbsp;its rising up the face of the wall, but the force of the recoil is&nbsp;correspondingly augmented. A wall with a vertical face offers&nbsp;more direct opposition to a wave, minimizes the tendency to rise,&nbsp;and consequently the recoil; while a stepped face tends to&nbsp;break up both the ascending and recoiling wave in proportion&nbsp;to the recession of the steps, but there is a corresponding liability&nbsp;to displacement of the blocks composing the wall. The concrete&nbsp;sea-walls erected in front of Hove, Margate, and the north cliff&nbsp;at Scarborough (see figs. 4, 5, 6) exhibit straight, stepped, and&nbsp;curved forms of batter. The curvature of the last-named wall,&nbsp;though diverting the coil at its base, did not prevent erosion of&nbsp;the shale bed on which it was founded, and a protective apron&nbsp;in front of the toe had to be added subsequently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Beaconsfield sea-wall at Bridlington (see fig. 7) is stepped and slightly curved; it has a stone face with concrete backing,</span></p>
