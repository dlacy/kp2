Mantz, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gazette du&nbsp;Beaux Arts,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1872.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REGNAULT, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Henri Victor </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1811-1878), was born on July 21, 1811, at Aix-la-Chapelle. His early life was&nbsp;a struggle with poverty. When a boy he went to Paris,&nbsp;and after a time succeeded in obtaining a situation in a&nbsp;large drapery establishment, where he remained, occupying&nbsp;every spare hour in study, until he was in his twentieth&nbsp;year. Then he entered the École Polytechnique, and, after&nbsp;making the best use of his increased opportunities, passed&nbsp;in 1832 to the Ecole des Mines, where he developed an&nbsp;aptitude for experimental chemistry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A few years later he was appointed to a professorship of chemistry at Lyons, and devoted himself to research&nbsp;amongst organic compounds. He paid little attention to&nbsp;theories and cared only for facts ; but, by his unequivocal&nbsp;proof of the substitution of chlorine for hydrogen in hydrocarbons, he greatly assisted his countrymen Laurent and&nbsp;Dumas in establishing the type-theory of organic compounds. Regnault’s most important chemical work was a&nbsp;series of researches, commenced in 1835, on the haloid and&nbsp;other derivatives of unsaturated hydrocarbons. This made&nbsp;him the discoverer of the vinyl group of compounds, carbon tetrachloride (CC1<sub>4</sub>), and of perchlorether (C<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>10</sub>O).&nbsp;He studied many of the natural alkaloids and organic&nbsp;acids, introduced a classification of the metals according to&nbsp;the facility with which they or their sulphides are oxidized&nbsp;by steam at high temperatures, and effected a comparison&nbsp;of the chemical composition of atmospheric air from all&nbsp;parts of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1840 Régnault was recalled to Paris by his appointment to the chair of chemistry in the École Polytechnique ; at the same time he was elected a member of the Académie&nbsp;des Sciences, in the chemical section, in room of M.&nbsp;Robiquet ; and in the following year he became professor of&nbsp;physics in the Collège de Prance, there succeeding Dulong,&nbsp;his old master, and in many respects his model. From&nbsp;this time Régnault devoted almost all his attention to&nbsp;practical physics; but in 1847 he published a four-volume&nbsp;treatise on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chemistry</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> which was highly esteemed and has&nbsp;been translated into many languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Régnault is perhaps best known by his careful redetermination of the specific heats of all the elements obtainable, and of many compounds—solids, liquids, and gases—by&nbsp;which he was enabled to correct the values obtained by&nbsp;Dulong and Petit, and to reduce the number of exceptions&nbsp;to their law that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the specific heat of an element varies&nbsp;inversely as its atomic weight</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">and of a compound as its&nbsp;molecular weight.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> He investigated the expansibility of gases&nbsp;by heat, determined the coefficient for air as 003663־, and&nbsp;showed that, contrary to previous opinion, no two gases&nbsp;had precisely the same rate of expansion. By numerous&nbsp;delicate experiments he proved Boyle’s law that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the volume&nbsp;of a gas is inversely as the pressure it supports</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> to be only&nbsp;approximately true, and that those gases which are most&nbsp;readily liquefied diverge most widely from obedience to the&nbsp;law. Régnault studied the whole subject of thermometry&nbsp;critically; he introduced the use of an accurate air-thermometer, and compared its indications with those of a&nbsp;mercurial thermometer, determining the absolute dilatation&nbsp;of mercury by heat as a step in the process. He also paid&nbsp;attention to hygrometry and devised a hygrometer in which&nbsp;a cooled metal surface is used for the deposition of&nbsp;moisture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1854 he was appointed to succeed Ebelman as director of the celebrated porcelain manufactory at Sèvres. He&nbsp;carried on the great research on the expansion of gases&nbsp;in the laboratory at Sèvres, but all the results of his latest&nbsp;work were destroyed during the Franco-German War, in&nbsp;which also his son Henri (noticed above) was killed.&nbsp;Régnault never recovered the double blow, and, although&nbsp;he lived until January 19, 1878, his scientific labours&nbsp;ended in 1872. He wrote more than eighty papers on&nbsp;scientific subjects, and he made fine researches, many of&nbsp;them of importance, in conjunction with other workers.&nbsp;His greatest work, bearing on the practical treatment of&nbsp;steam-engines, forms vol. xxi. of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mémoires de l'Académie&nbsp;des Sciences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Régnault was great as a laborious worker ; in all his researches he overcame every difficulty by his determined perseverance, his unusual natural ingenuity in devising apparatus, and his rare power of&nbsp;manipulation. Although few discoveries are associated with his&nbsp;name, the mass of physical constants which he determined with&nbsp;the utmost accuracy constitutes a powerful instrument of further&nbsp;advance, and the thorough training which he gave his students has&nbsp;provided many painstaking and exact workers in the field of&nbsp;physics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REGNAL’LT, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Jean Baptiste, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">French painter, was born at Paris on 9th October 1754, and died in the same city&nbsp;on November 12, 1829. He began life at sea in a merchant vessel, but at the age of fifteen his talent attracted&nbsp;attention and he was sent to Italy by M. de Monval under&nbsp;the care of Bardin. After his return to Paris, Régnault, in&nbsp;1776, obtained the Great Prize, andin 1783 he was elected&nbsp;Academician. His diploma picture, the Education of&nbsp;Achilles by Chiron, is now in the Louvre, as also the&nbsp;Christ taken down from the Cross, originally executed for&nbsp;the royal chapel at Fontainebleau, and two minor works—&nbsp;the Origin of Painting and Pygmalion praying Venus to&nbsp;give Life to his Statue. Besides various small pictures&nbsp;and allegorical subjects, Régnault was also the author of&nbsp;many large historical paintings ; and his school, which&nbsp;reckoned amongst its chief attendants Guérin, Crepin,&nbsp;Lafitte, Blondel, Robert Lefevre, and Menjaud, was for a&nbsp;long while the rival in influence of that of David.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REGNIER, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Mathurin </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1573-1613), the greatest satirist of France, was born at Chartres on the 21st&nbsp;December 1573. His father, Jacques Regnier, was a&nbsp;bourgeois of good means and position ; his mother,&nbsp;Simonne Desportes, was the sister of the poetical Abbé&nbsp;Desportes, one of the most distinguished of the disciples&nbsp;of Ronsard. Desportes, who was richly beneficed and in&nbsp;great favour at court, seems to have been regarded at once&nbsp;as Mathurin Regnier’s natural protector and patron, and&nbsp;the boy himself, with a view to his following in his uncle’s&nbsp;steps, was tonsured at nine years old. It appears that&nbsp;Jacques Regnier, at any rate for a time, encouraged his son&nbsp;to imitate his uncle in poetry also, though he afterwards&nbsp;changed his views. The boy was somewhat early introduced&nbsp;to general society of the jovial kind, for his father built a&nbsp;tennis court at the end of his garden which became semipublic and was much frequented. The poet’s enemies said&nbsp;that his father had been a common gaming-house keeper,&nbsp;and that the court was built with the ruins of some church&nbsp;property ; but this seems to be mere scandal. Little is&nbsp;known of his youth, and it is chiefly conjecture which fixes&nbsp;the date of his visit to Italy in the suite of the Cardinal&nbsp;de Joyeuse in 1586. Others give 1583 and 1593, but&nbsp;the former date is certainly too early, and the latter probably too late. Indeed the greatest uncertainty exists as&nbsp;to the dates and incidents of Regnier’s short life, and his&nbsp;biographers hitherto have chiefly busied themselves in</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
