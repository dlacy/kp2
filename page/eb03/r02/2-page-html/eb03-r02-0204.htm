<p><span class="font0">contribute to the ſupport of his power, he took every precaution to provide for their ſafety ; ſo that we find&nbsp;but two inſurrections in this reign.—In the fourth&nbsp;year of his reign, Antiochus king of Comagena, holding a private correſpondence with the Parthians. the&nbsp;declared enemies of Rome, was taken priſoner in Cilicia, by Pyrrhus the governor, and font bound to&nbsp;Rome. But Veſpaſian generouſly prevented all ill&nbsp;treatment, by giving him a reſidence at Lacedæmon,&nbsp;and allowing him a revenue ſuitable to his dignity.&nbsp;About the ſame time alſo, the Alani, a barbarous&nbsp;people inhabiting along the river Tanais, abandoned&nbsp;their barren wilds, and invaded the kingdom of Media.&nbsp;From thence paſſing into Armenia, after great ravages, they overthrew Tiridates, the king of that country, with prodigious ſlaughter. Titus was at length&nbsp;ſeitt to chaſtiſe their inſolence : but the barbarians retired at the approach of the Roman army, loaded with&nbsp;plunder ; being compelled to wait a more favourable&nbsp;opportunity of renewing their irruptions. Theſe incurſions, however, were but a tranſient ſtorm, the effects of which were ſoon repaired by the emperor’s moderation and aſſiduity. We are told, that he now&nbsp;formed and eſtabliſhed a thouſand nations, which had&nbsp;ſcarcely before amounted to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">too.</span><span class="font0"> No provinces in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">empire lay out of his view and protection» He had, during his whole reign, a particular regard to Britain ;&nbsp;his generals, Petilius Cerealis, and Julius Frontinus,&nbsp;brought the greateſt part of the iſland into ſubjection ;&nbsp;and Agricola, who ſucceeded ſoon after, completed&nbsp;what they had begun. See England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In this manner, having reigned io years, loved by his ſubjects, and deſerving their affection, he was ſurpriſed by an indiſpoſition at Campania, which he at&nbsp;once declared would be fatal, crying out, in the ſpirit&nbsp;of Paganiſm, “ Methinks I am going to be a god.”&nbsp;Removing from thence to the city, and afterwards to a&nbsp;country-ſeat near Reate, he was there taken with a flux,&nbsp;which brought him to the laſt extremity. However,&nbsp;perceiving his end approach, and juſt going to expire,&nbsp;he cried out, that an emperor ought to die ſtanding ;&nbsp;•wherefore, raiſing himſelf upon his feet, he expired in&nbsp;the hands of thoſe that ſuſtained him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Titus being joyfully received as emperor, notwithſtanding a flight oppoſition from his brother Domitian, who maintained that he himſelf was appointed, and that&nbsp;Titus had falſified the will, began his reign with every&nbsp;virtue that became an emperor and a man. During the&nbsp;liſe of his ſather there had been many imputations&nbsp;againſt him ; but upon his exaltation to the throne he&nbsp;ſeemed entirely to take leave of his former vices, and&nbsp;became an.example of the greateſt moderation and humanity. He had long loved Berenice, ſiſter to Agrippa king of Judea, a woman of the greateſt beauty and&nbsp;allurements. But knowing that the connection with&nbsp;her was entirely diſagreeable to the people of Rome,&nbsp;he ſent her away, notwithſtanding their mutual paſſion&nbsp;and the many arts ſhe uſed to induce him to change his&nbsp;reſolutions. He next diſcarded all thoſe who had been&nbsp;the former miniſters of his pleaſures, and forbore to&nbsp;coιa<sup>ι</sup>tenance the companions of his looſer recreations,&nbsp;though he had formerly taken great pains in the ſelec-tion. This moderation, added to his juſtice and gene-τofity, procured him tne love of all good men, and the&nbsp;appellation of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">delight of mankind,</span><span class="font0"> which all his ac</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">tions ſeemed calculated to enſure. As he came to the throne with all the advantages of his father’s popularity,&nbsp;he was reſolved to uſe every method to increaſe it. He&nbsp;therefore took particular care to puniſh all informers,&nbsp;falſe witneſſes, and promoters of diſſenſion, condemning&nbsp;them to be ſcourged in the moſt public ſtreets, next to&nbsp;be dragged through the theatre, and then to be baniſhed to the uninhabited parts of the empire, and ſold as&nbsp;ſlaves. His courteſy and readineſs to do good have&nbsp;been celebrated even by Chriſtian writers ; his principal&nbsp;rule being, never to ſend any petitioner diſſatisſied away.&nbsp;One night, recollecting that he had done nothing beneficial to mankind the day preceding, he cried out among&nbsp;his friends, “ I have loſt a day.” A ſentence too remarkable not to be univerſally known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In this reign, an eruption of mount Vefuvius did conſiderable damage, overwhelming many towns, and&nbsp;ſending its aſhes into countries more than ιoo miles&nbsp;diſtant. Upon this !remorable occaſion, Pliny the naturaliſt loſt his life ; for, being impe'ſted by too eager a&nbsp;curioſity to obſerve the eruption, he was ſuffocated in&nbsp;the flames j∙. There happened alſo about this time a&nbsp;fire at Rome, which continued three days and nights&nbsp;ſucceſſively, which was followed by a plague, in which&nbsp;10,0 O men were buried in a day. The emperor, how·&nbsp;ever, did all that lay in his power to repair the damage&nbsp;ſuſtained by the public ; and, with reſpect to the city,&nbsp;declared that he would take the whole loſs of it upon&nbsp;himſelf. Theſe diſaſters were in ſome meaſure counterbalanced by the ſucceſſes in Britain, under Agricola.&nbsp;This excellent general having been ſent into that country towards the latter end of Veſpaſian’s reign, ſhowed&nbsp;himſelf equally expert in quelling the refractory, and civilizing thoſe who had formerly ſubmitted to the Roman power. The Ordovices, or inhabitants of North&nbsp;Wales, were the firſt that were ſubdued. He then made&nbsp;a deſcent upon Mona, or the iſland of Angleſea ;&nbsp;which ſurrendered at diſcretion. Having thus rendered&nbsp;himſelf maſter of the whole country, he took every method to reſtore diſcipline to his own army, and to introduce ſome ſhare of politeneſs among thoſe whom he&nbsp;had conquered. He exhorted them, both by advice&nbsp;and example, to build temples, theatres, and ſtately&nbsp;houſes. He cauſed the ſons of their nobility to be inſtructed in the liberal arts ; he had them taught the&nbsp;Latin language, and induced them to imitate the Roman modes of dreſſing and living. Thus, by degrees,&nbsp;this barbarous people began to aſſume the luxurious&nbsp;manners of their conquerors, and in time even outdid&nbsp;them in all the refinements of ſenſual pleaſure. For the&nbsp;ſucceſs in Britain, Titus was ſaluted emperor the j 5th&nbsp;time ; but he did not long ſurvive his honours, being ſeized with a violent fever at a little diſtance&nbsp;from Rome. Perceiving his death to approach,&nbsp;he declared, that during the whole courſe of his liſe&nbsp;he knew but of one action which he repented of ; but&nbsp;that action he did not think proper to expreſs. Shortly&nbsp;after, he died (not without ſuſpicion of treachery from&nbsp;his brother Domitian, who had long wiſhed to govern)&nbsp;in the 41 ſt year of his age, having reigned two years&nbsp;two months and twenty days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The love which ail ranks of people bore to Tituà, facilitated the election of his brother Domitian, notwithſtanding the ill opinion many had already conceived&nbsp;of him. Hie ambition was already but too well</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
