<p><span class="font2">in which these feathers persist, the Rook may be readily known from the black form of </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Crow</span><span class="font2"> (vol. vi. p. 618) by&nbsp;the rich purple gloss of its black plumage, especially on&nbsp;the head and neck, the feathers of which are soft and not&nbsp;pointed. In a general way the appearance and manners&nbsp;of the Rook are so well known, to most inhabitants of the&nbsp;British Islands especially, that it is needless here to dwell&nbsp;upon them, and particularly its habit of forming communities in the breeding-season, which it possesses in a&nbsp;measure beyond that of any other land bird of the&nbsp;northern hemisphere. Yet each of these communities,&nbsp;or rookeries, seems to have some custom intrinsically its&nbsp;own, the details of which want of space forbids any&nbsp;attempt to set before the reader. In a general way the&nbsp;least-known part of the Rook’s mode of life are facts relating&nbsp;to its migration and geographical distribution. Though&nbsp;the great majority of Rooks in Britain are sedentary or&nbsp;only change their abode to a very limited extent, it is&nbsp;now certain that a very considerable number visit this&nbsp;country in or towards autumn, not necessarily to abide&nbsp;here, but merely to pass onward, like most other kinds of&nbsp;birds, to winter further southwards ; and, at the same&nbsp;season or even a little earlier, it cannot be doubted that a&nbsp;large proportion of the young of the year emigrate in the&nbsp;same direction. As a species the Rook on the European&nbsp;continent only resides during the whole year throughout the middle tract of its ordinary range. Further to&nbsp;the northward, as in Sweden and northern Russia, it is a&nbsp;regular summer-immigrant, while further to the southward,&nbsp;as in southern France, Spain, and most parts of Italy, it&nbsp;is, on the contrary, a regular winter-immigrant. The same&nbsp;is found to be the case in Asia, where it extends eastward&nbsp;as far as the upper Irtish and the Ob. It breeds throughout Turkestan, in the cold weather visiting Afghanistan,&nbsp;Cashmere, and the Punjab, and Sir Oliver St John found&nbsp;a rookery of considerable size at Casbin in Persia. In&nbsp;Palestine and in Lower Egypt it is only a winter-visitant,&nbsp;and Canon Tristram noticed that it congregates in great&nbsp;numbers about the mosque of Omar in Jerusalem.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are several moot points in the natural history of the Rook which it is impossible here to do more than mention. One is the&nbsp;cause of the curious shedding on reaching maturity of the feathers&nbsp;of its face, and another the burning question whether Rooks are on&nbsp;the whole beneficial or detrimental to agriculture. In England&nbsp;the former opinion seems to be generally entertained, but in&nbsp;Scotland the latter has long been popular. Tlie absence of sufficient observations made by persons at once competent and without&nbsp;bias compels the naturalist to withhold his judgment on the matter,&nbsp;but the absence of such observations is eminently discreditable to the&nbsp;numerous Agricultural Societies of the United Kingdom, (a. n.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROOKE, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sir George</span><span class="font2"> [(1650-1709), naval commander, was born near Canterbury in 1650. Entering the navy as&nbsp;a volunteer, he became post-captain in 1680, and vice-admiral in 1692. In May of this year he greatly distinguished himself in a night attack on the French fleet&nbsp;off Cape La Hogue, when he succeeded in burning six of&nbsp;their ships. Shortly afterwards he received the honour of&nbsp;knighthood and a reward of ,£1000. In 1702 he commanded the expedition against Cadiz, and on the passage&nbsp;home captured the Plate fleet off Vigo. Along with Sir&nbsp;Cloudesley Shovel he took part in the capture of Gibraltar,&nbsp;21st July 1704. On 13th August of the same year he&nbsp;attacked the French fleet off Malaga, the battle being&nbsp;drawn. On account of the dissatisfaction expressed&nbsp;indirectly at the result of the contest, he retired from the&nbsp;service in February 1705. He died 24th January 1709.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> It is right to mention that the Canon considers the Rook of Palestine entitled to specific distinction as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Corms ayrieola (,Proe.&nbsp;Zook Society,</span><span class="font1"> 1864, p. 444 ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ibis,</span><span class="font1"> 1866, pp. 68, 69).

<p><span class="font2">ROPE. All varieties of cordage having a circumference of an inch or more are known by the general name of&nbsp;rope. Twisted cordages of smaller dimensions are called&nbsp;cords, twines, and lines, and when the dimensions are&nbsp;still smaller the article becomes thread or doubled yarn.&nbsp;All these varieties of cordage are composed of at least&nbsp;two, and in most cases of very many separate yarns, which&nbsp;are textile fibres drawn out and twisted into a uniform&nbsp;compact line. From thread and fine twine upwards the&nbsp;whole art of manufacture is simply that of twisting together&nbsp;fibres and yarns, but the comparative heaviness and coarseness of the materials operated on in rope-making render&nbsp;necessary the adoption of strong machinery and modified&nbsp;processes which clearly define this manufacture as a distinct&nbsp;calling. The modern trade of rope-making is again divided&nbsp;into two branches dealing respectively with certain vegetable&nbsp;fibres and with metallic wire. Silk cords and hair lines&nbsp;and ropes do not come within the scope of rope-making&nbsp;proper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Vegetable fibres fit for rope-making are numerous, but ordinarily not many are employed. Speaking generally,&nbsp;for the prime requisites of strength, suppleness, flexibility, and durability, none can*compete with the common&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hemp </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">[q.v.</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">∖</span><span class="font2"> which consequently is the staple of the rope-maker. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Manila Hemp</span><span class="font2"> (ç.f.) is a fibre of the most&nbsp;remarkable tenacity, of unapproached value for heavy-cordage, but too stiff and woody for small cords and&nbsp;twines. After these in utility come sisal hemp of South&nbsp;America </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">[Agave sisalana),</span><span class="font2"> phormium hemp of New Zealand&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">[Phormium tenax,</span><span class="font2"> see vol. xviii. p. 812), and the sunn&nbsp;hemp of the East Indies </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">[Grotalama juncea,</span><span class="font2"> see vol. xi. p.&nbsp;647)—all fibres of great strength, and largely used by rope-makers. Among fibres more rarely seen in rope-works are&nbsp;Jubbulpore hemp </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">[Grotalaria temcifolid),</span><span class="font2"> bowstring hemp&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">[Sanseviera Zeylanica),</span><span class="font2"> and other “hemps” of the East&nbsp;Indies, and plantain fibre (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Musa paradisixa)</span><span class="font2"> and agave fibre&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">[Agave americancι)</span><span class="font2"> of America. Ropes and twine of cotton&nbsp;are extensively made, especially for driving-bands for&nbsp;machinery. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jute </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">[q.v.~)</span><span class="font2"> is now in considerable use by&nbsp;rope-makers, on account of its cheapness, but it is very-deficient in strength and durability. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Coir</span><span class="font2"> (see vol. vi. p.&nbsp;917) is also largely employed, and many other fibres are&nbsp;used, principally in the localities of their production.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A rope is composed of a certain number of “ strands,” the strand being itself made up of many “yarns.”&nbsp;Three strands laid or twisted together form a “ hawser-laid” rope, and three such hawsers similarly laid make&nbsp;a “ cable-laid rope ” or “ cable. ” A “ shroud-laid ” rope&nbsp;consists of four strands laid around a central strand&nbsp;or core. The prepared fibre is twisted or spun to the&nbsp;right hand to form yarn ; the required number of yarns&nbsp;receive a left hand twist to make a strand ; three strands&nbsp;twisted to the right make a hawser ; and three hawsers&nbsp;twisted to the left yield a cable. Thus the twist in each&nbsp;successive operation is in a different direction from the&nbsp;preceding, and this alternation of direction serves to some&nbsp;extent to preserve the parallelism of the fibres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The primary object of twisting fibres together in a rope is that by mutual friction they may be held together when&nbsp;a strain is applied to the whole. Hard twisting has the&nbsp;further advantage of compacting the fibres and preventing the penetration of moisture when the ropes are&nbsp;exposed to water. The proper degree of twist is a&nbsp;matter of considerable importance, as all twisting injuriously affects the strength of the individual fibres, and&nbsp;indeed it is possible to twist a cord so hard that it will&nbsp;break under the action. The degree of twist given to&nbsp;ropes is generally such that the rope is from three-fourths to two-thirds the length of the yarn composing&nbsp;it, and the lighter the twist the greater in proportion is</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
