<p><span class="font1">acts of that assembly teach us otherwise; the privilege which the Roman legates possessed was that of voting first (the right&nbsp;of thc </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">princeps senatus).</span><span class="font1"> The first gcncral council at which&nbsp;a churchman presided was the scvcnth (at Nicaea, 787), at which&nbsp;the emperor (or empress) deputed, not a layman, but the patriarch&nbsp;Tarasius to preside. The resolutions of thcsc ccclesiastical&nbsp;state-councils did not become the law of thc Empire till&nbsp;they were confirmed by imperial edicts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The emperors, in their capacity as heads of thc Church, did not confine themselves to controlling it by controlling the&nbsp;councils. They soon began to issue edicts dealing with theology,&nbsp;by virtue of their own authority. It has been said that the&nbsp;council of Chalcedon closed an epoch of “ parliamentary constitutionalism ”; a general council was not summoned again&nbsp;for more than one hundred years, though the Empire during&nbsp;that period was seething with religious disunion and unrest.&nbsp;The usurper Basiliscus in his short reign set an example which&nbsp;his successors were not slow to follow. He issued an edict&nbsp;quashing the decision of Chalcedon. Zeno<sup>i</sup>S </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Henotikon</span><span class="font1"> (see&nbsp;below) a few years later was the second and more famous&nbsp;example of a method which Justinian largely used, and of which&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ecthesis</span><span class="font1"> of Heraclius, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Type</span><span class="font1"> of Constans II. and the&nbsp;iconoclastic edicts of Leo III. are well-known instances. It&nbsp;was a question of political expediency (determined by the&nbsp;circumstances, the intensity and nature of the opposition, &amp;c.)&nbsp;whether an emperor supported his policy or not by an ccclesiastical council.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The emperor was always able to control the election of the patriarch, and through him he directed the Church. Sometimes emperor and patriarch collided; but in general the&nbsp;patriarchs were docile instruments, and when they wcre refractory they could be deposed. There were several means of&nbsp;resistance open to a patriarch, though he rarely availcd himself&nbsp;of them. His participation in the ceremony of coronation was&nbsp;indispensable, and he could refuse to crown a new emperor&nbsp;except on certain conditions, and thus dictate a policy (instances&nbsp;in 812, Michael I.; 969, John Zimisces). There was the power&nbsp;of excommunication (Leo VI. was excommunicated on account&nbsp;of his fourth marriage). Another mcans of resistance for the&nbsp;Church was to invoke the support of the bishop of Romc, who&nbsp;embodied the principle of ecclesiastical independence and&nbsp;whose see admittedly enjoyed precedence and primacy over all&nbsp;the sces in Christendom. Up to the end of the 8th century he&nbsp;was a subject of the emperor, and some emperors exerted their&nbsp;ecclesiastical control over Rome by drastic measures (Justinian&nbsp;and Constans II.). But after thc conquest of Italy by Charles&nbsp;the Great, the pope was outside the Byzantine domination;&nbsp;after the coronation of Charles in 800 he was associated with a&nbsp;rival empire; and when ecclesiastical controversies arose in the&nbsp;East, the party in opposition was always ready to appeal to&nbsp;him as the highest authority in Christendom. Under the&nbsp;iconoclastic emperors the image-worshippers lookcd to him as&nbsp;the guardian of orthodoxy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As to the ecclesiastical controversies which form a leading feature of Byzantine history, their political significance alone&nbsp;concerns us. After the determination of the Arian controversy&nbsp;in 381 new questions (as to the union of the divine and human&nbsp;elements in the person of Christ: one or two natures?) arose,&nbsp;and it may seem surprising that such points of abstruse theology&nbsp;should have awakened universal interest and led to serious&nbsp;consequences. The secret was that they masked national&nbsp;feelings; hence their political importance and the attention&nbsp;which the government was forced to bestow on them. The&nbsp;reviving sense of nationality (anti-Greek) in Syria and in Egypt&nbsp;found expression in the 5th century in passionate monophysitism&nbsp;(the doctrine of one nature) : theology was the only sphere in&nbsp;which such feelings could be uttered. The alienation and&nbsp;dissension which thus began had fatal consequences, smoothing&nbsp;the way for the Saracen conquests of those lands; the inhabitants were not unwilling to be severed politically from the&nbsp;Empire. This ultimate danger was at first hardly visible.&nbsp;What immediately troubled the emperors in the first half of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sth century was the preponderant position which thc sec of Alexandria occupied, threatening the highcr authority of Constantinople. The council of Chalcedon, called by Marcian, an&nbsp;able statcsman, was as much for thc purpose of ending the&nbsp;domination of Alexandria as of settling the theological question.&nbsp;The former objcct was effected, but the theological decision of&nbsp;the council was fatal; it only scaled and promoted the disunion.&nbsp;The rccalcitrant spirit of Syria and Egypt forced Zeno, thirty&nbsp;ycars latcr, to issue his Henotikon, affirming the decisions of&nbsp;previous councils but pointedly ignoring Chalcedon. This&nbsp;statesman-like document secured peace in the East for&nbsp;a génération. Rome refused to accept the Henötikon,&nbsp;and when Justinian resolved to restore impérial supremacy&nbsp;in the Wcstern kingdoms, conciliation with Rome became </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">matter of political importance. For the sake of this project,&nbsp;the unity of the East was sacrificed. The doctrine of Chalccdon&nbsp;was reasserted, the IIenotikon set aside; New Rome and Old&nbsp;Rome were again hand in hand. This meant the final alienation&nbsp;of Egypt and Syria. The national instinct which had been&nbsp;alive in the 5th century grew into strong national sentiment in&nbsp;thc 6th. One of the chief anxieties of Justinian<sup>i</sup>S long and busy&nbsp;reign was to repair the mischief. Deeply interested himself in&nbsp;matters of dogma, and prepared to assert to its fullest extent&nbsp;his authority as head of the Church, he has been called “ the&nbsp;passionate theologian on the throne ”; but in his ’chief ecclesiastical measures political considerations were predominant.&nbsp;His wife Theodora was a monophysite, and he permitted her&nbsp;to extend her protection to the heretics. He sought new&nbsp;formulae for the purpose of reconciliation, but nothing short of&nbsp;repudiation of the Chalcedon acts would have been enough.&nbsp;The last great efforts for union were made when the Saracens&nbsp;invaded and conquered the dissident provinces. A new formula&nbsp;of union was discovered (One Will and One Energy). This&nbsp;doctrine of monothelism would never have been heard of but&nbsp;for political exigencies. The Egyptians and Syrians would&nbsp;perhaps have accepted this compromise; but it was repudiated&nbsp;by the fanatical adherents of Chalcedon. Heraclius sought to&nbsp;impose the doctrine by an edict (Ecthcsis, 638), but the storm,&nbsp;especially in Italy and Africa, was so great that ten years later&nbsp;an edict known as thc Type was issued by Constans forbidding&nbsp;all disputation about the number of wills and energies. Constans&nbsp;was a strong ruler, and maintained the Type in spite of orthodox&nbsp;opposition throughout his reign. But the expediency of this&nbsp;policy passed when the Saracens were inexpugnably settled&nbsp;in their conquests, and in his &quot;successor’s reign it was more&nbsp;worth while to effect a reconciliation with Rome and the West.&nbsp;This was the cause of the 6th Ecumenical Council which&nbsp;condemned monothelism (680-681).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the Hellenic parts of the Empire devotion to orthodoxy scrved as a chrysalis for the national sentiment which was to&nbsp;burst its shell in thc 10th century. For the Greeks Christianity&nbsp;had been in a certain way continuous with paganism. It might&nbsp;be said that the old deities and heroes who had protected their&nbsp;cities wcrc still their guardians, under thc new form of saints&nbsp;(sometimes imaginary) and archangels, and performed for them&nbsp;the same kind of miracles. Pagan idolatry was replaced by&nbsp;Christian image-worship, which by the Christians of many&nbsp;parts of Asia Minor, as well as by the Mahommedans, was&nbsp;regarded as simply polytheism. Thus in the great iconoclastic&nbsp;controversy, which distracted the Empire for nearly 120 years,&nbsp;was involved, as in the monophysitic, the antagonism between&nbsp;different racial elements and geographical sections. Leo III.,&nbsp;whose services as a great deliverer and reformer were obscured&nbsp;in the memory of posterity by the ill-fame which he won as an&nbsp;iconoclast, was a native of Commagcne. His first edict against&nbsp;the veneration of pictures evoked riots in the capital and a&nbsp;revolt in Greece. The opposition was everywhere voiced by&nbsp;the monks, and it is not to be overlooked that for many monks&nbsp;the painting of sacred pictures was their means of existence.&nbsp;Leo’s son Constantine V. pursued the same policy with greater&nbsp;rigour, meeting the monastic resistance by systematic persecution, and in his reign a general council condemned image-worship</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
