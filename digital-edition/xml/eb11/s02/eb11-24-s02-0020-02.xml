                <p><label>SAINT-JUST, ANTOINE LOUIS LÉON DE RICHEBOURG DE</label> (1767-1794),
                    French revolutionary leader, was born at Decize in the Nivernais on the 25th of
                    August 1767. At the outbreak of the Revolution, intoxicated with republican
                    ideas, he threw himself with enthusiasm into politics, was elected an officer in
                    the National Guard of the Aisne, and by fraud—he being yet under age—admitted as
                    a member of the electoral assembly of his district. Early in 1789 he had
                    published twenty cantos of licentious verse, in the fashion of the time, under
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">Organt au Vatican.</hi> Henceforward, however, he
                    assumed a stoical demeanour, which, united to a policy tyrannical and pitilessly
                    thorough, became the characteristic of his life. He entered into correspondence
                    with Robespierre, who, flattered by his worship, admitted him to his friendship.
                    Thus supported, Saint-Just became deputy of the department of Aisne to the
                    National Convention, where he made his first speech on the condemnation of Louis
                    XVI.—gloomy, fanatical, remorseless in tone—on the 13th of November 1792. In the
                    Convention, in the Jacobin Club, and among the populace his relations with
                    Robespierre became known, and he was dubbed the “ St John of the Messiah of the
                    people.” His appointment as a member of the Committee of Public Safety placed
                    him at the centre of the political fever-heat. In the name of this committee he
                    was charged with the drawing up of reports to the Convention upon the absorbing
                    themes of the overthrow of the party of the Gironde (report of the 8th of July
                    1793), of the Hérbertists, and finally, of that denunciation of Danton which
                    consigned him and his followers to the guillotine. What were then called reports
                    were rather appeals to the passions; in Saint-Just’s hands they furnished the
                    occasion for a display of fanatical daring, of gloomy eloquence, and of
                    undoubted genius; and—with the shadow of Robespierre behind him—they served
                    their turn. Camille Desmoulins, in jest and mockery, said of Saint-Just—the
                    youth with the beautiful countenance and the long fair locks— “ He carries his
                    head like a Holy Sacrament." “ And I,’’ savagely replied Saint-Just, “ will make
                    him carry his like a Saint Denis.’’ The threat was not vain: Desmoulins
                    accompanied Danton to the scaffold. The same ferocious inflexibility animated
                    Saint-Just with reference to the external policy of France. He proposed that the
                    National Convention should itself, through its committees, direct all military
                    movements and all branches of the government (report of the 10th of October
                    1793). This was agreed to, and Saint-Just was despatched to Strassburg, in
                    company with another deputy, to superintend the military operations. It was
                    suspected that the enemy without was being aided by treason within. Saint-Just’s
                    remedy was direct and terrible: he followed his experience in Paris, “ organized
                    the Terror,” and soon the heads of all suspects sent to Paris were falling under
                    the guillotine. But there were no executions at Strassburg, and Saint-Just
                    repressed the excesses of J. G. Schneider <hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> who as
                    public prosecutor to the revolu-tionary tribunal of the Lower Rhine had
                    ruthlessly applied the Terror in Alsace. Schneider was sent to Paris and
                    guillotined. The conspiracy was defeated, and the armies of the Rhine and
                    Moselle having been inspirited by success—Saint-Just himself taking a fearless
                    part in the actual fighting—and having effected a junction, the frontier was
                    delivered and Germany invaded. On his return Saint-Just was made president of
                    the Convention. Later, with the army of the North, he placed before the generals
                    the dilemma of victory over the enemies of France or trial by the dreaded
                    revolutionary tribunal; and before the eyes of the army itself he organized a
                    force specially charged with the slaughter of those who should seek refuge by
                    flight. Success again crowned his efforts, and Belgium was gained for France
                    (May, 1794). Meanwhile affairs in Paris looked gloomier than ever, and
                    Robespierre recalled Saint-Just to the capital. Saint-Just proposed a
                    dictatorship as the only remedy for the convulsions of society. At last, at the
                    famous sitting of the 9th Thermidor, he ventured to present as the report of the
                    committees of General Security and Public Safety a document expressing his own
                    views, a sight of which, however, had been refused to the other members of
                    committee on the previous evening. Then the storm broke. He was vehemently
                    interrupted, and the sitting ended with an order for Robespierre’s</p>

                <p>arrest (see Robespierre). On the following day, the 28th of July 1794, twenty-two
                    men, nearly all young, were guillotined. Saint-Just maintained his proud
                    self-possession to the last.</p>
