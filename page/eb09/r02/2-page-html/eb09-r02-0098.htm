<p><span class="font1">Jesuits in naming God Almighty, such as Tien, “Heaven,” and Shang-ti, “Supreme Ruler” or “Emperor,” instead of Tien-Chu,&nbsp;“Lord of Heaven,” and in particular the erection of inscribed&nbsp;tablets in the churches, on which these terms were made use of;@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>(2) in respect to the ceremonial offerings made in honour of&nbsp;Confucius, and of personal ancestors, which Ricci had recognized&nbsp;as merely “civil” observances; (3) the erection of tablets in&nbsp;honour of ancestors in private houses ; and (4), more generally,&nbsp;sanction and favour accorded to ancient Chinese sacred books&nbsp;and philosophical doctrine, as not really trespassing on Christian&nbsp;faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Probably no European name of past centuries is so well known in China as that of Li-ma-teu, the form in which the name of&nbsp;our missionary (,β⅛-cci Mat-teo') was adapted to Chinese usage, and&nbsp;by which he appears in Chinese records.@@<sup>2</sup> The works which he&nbsp;composed in Chinese are numerous ; a list of them (apparently&nbsp;by no means complete, however) will be found in Kivclier’s China&nbsp;Illustrata, and also in Abel Rémusat’s Nouveaux Mélanges&nbsp;Asiatiques (ii. pp. 213-215). They are said to display an aptitude&nbsp;for clothing ideas in a Chinese dress very rare and remarkable in&nbsp;a foreigner. One of the first which attracted attention and reputation among Chinese readers was a Treatise upon Friendship, in&nbsp;the form of a dialogue containing short and pithy paragraphs ; this&nbsp;is stated in the De Expeditione to have been suggested during&nbsp;Ricci’s stay at Nan-chang by a conversation with the prince of&nbsp;Kien-ngan, who asked questions regarding the laws of friendship&nbsp;in the West.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the early part of his residence at Peking, when enjoying constant intercourse with scholars of high position, Ricci brought out the Tien-chu shih-i, or “Veritable doctrine of the Lord of Heaven,”&nbsp;which deals with the divine character and attributes under eight&nbsp;heads. “This work,” says Mr A. Wylie, “contains some acute&nbsp;reasoning in support of the propositions laid down, but the doctrine&nbsp;of faith in Christ is very slightly touched upon. The teachings of&nbsp;Buddhism are vigorously attacked, whilst the author tries to draw&nbsp;a parallel between Christianity and the teachings of the Chinese&nbsp;literati.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1604 Ricci completed the Erh-shih-wu yen, a series of short articles of moral bearing, but exhibiting little of the essential&nbsp;doctrines of Christianity. Chi-jên shih ρien is another of his productions, completed in 1608, and consisting of a record of ten conversations held with Chinese of high position. The subjects are :—&nbsp;(1) Years past no longer ours ; (2) Man a sojourner on earth ; (3)&nbsp;Advantage of frequent contemplation of eternity ; (4) Preparation for judgment by such contemplation ; (5) The good man not&nbsp;desirous of talking ; (6) Abstinence, and its distinction from the&nbsp;prohibition to take life ; (7) Self-examination and self-reproof&nbsp;inconsistent with inaction; (8) Future reward and punishment;&nbsp;(9) Prying into futurity hastens calamity ; (10) Wealth with&nbsp;covetousness more wretched than poverty with contentment. To&nbsp;this work is appended a translation of eight European hymns,&nbsp;with elucidations, written in 1609.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some of the characteristics briefly indicated here may have suggested, though probably they are far from justifying, the&nbsp;bitterness of attacks made upon Ricci’s theology, long after he had&nbsp;been in his grave, by some of the opponents of the Jesuits in the&nbsp;controversies to which we have referred. An example of these is&nbsp;found in the work called Anecdotes sur l'État de Religion dans la&nbsp;Chine, Paris, 1733-35, the author of which (Abbé Villers) speaks&nbsp;of the T'ien-ehu shih-i in this fashion—“The Jesuit was also so ill&nbsp;versed in the particulars of the faith that, as the holy bishop of&nbsp;Conon, Monsgr. Maigrot, says of him, one need merely read his&nbsp;book on the true religion to convince oneself that he had never&nbsp;imbibed the first elements of theology”. . . . The writer goes&nbsp;on to say other things even much more bitter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ricci’s pointed attacks on Buddhism, and the wide circulation of his books, called forth the opposition of the Buddhist clergy.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">One of the ablest who took their part was Chu-hang, a priest of Hang-chau, who had abandoned the literary status for the Buddhist cloister. He wrote three articles against the doctrine of the&nbsp;missionaries. These were brought to Ricci’s notice in an ostensible&nbsp;tone of candour by Yu-chun-he, a high mandarin at the capital.&nbsp;This letter, with Ricci’s reply, the three Buddhist declamations,&nbsp;and Ricci’s confutation, were published in a collected form by the&nbsp;Christian Sen-Kwang-K’e.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another work of Ricci’s which attracted attention was the Hsi-kuo fa, or “Art of Memory as practised in the West.” Ricci&nbsp;was himself a great, expert in memoria techniea, and astonished&nbsp;the Chinese by his performances in this line. He also wrote or&nbsp;edited various Chinese works on geography, the celestial and&nbsp;terrestrial spheres, geometry, and arithmetic.@@<sup>3</sup> And the detailed&nbsp;history of the mission was drawn out by him, which after his&nbsp;death was brought home by P. Nicolas Trigault, and published at&nbsp;Augsburg, and in a complete form at Lyons a year later under the&nbsp;name De Expeditione Christiana aρud Sinas Suscepta, ab Soe. Jesu,&nbsp;Ex P. Mat. Ricci ejusdem Societatis Commentariis, in which Trigault himself added a large amount of interesting matter respecting&nbsp;China and the Chinese.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Among the scientific works of his time which Ricci took with him into China, there was a fine set of maps, which at first&nbsp;created great interest, but disgust afterwards when the Chinese&nbsp;came to perceive the insignificant place assigned therein to the&nbsp;“Middle Kingdom,” thrust, as it seemed, into a corner, instead of&nbsp;being set in the centre of the world like the gem in a ring. Ricci,&nbsp;seeing their dissatisfaction, set about constructing a map of the&nbsp;hemisphere on a great scale, so adjusted that China, with its&nbsp;subject states, filled the central area, and, without deviating from&nbsp;truth of projection, occupied a large space in proportion to the&nbsp;other kingdoms gathered round it. All the names were then&nbsp;entered in Chinese calligraphy. This map obtained immense&nbsp;favour, and was immediately engraved at the expense of the viceroy,&nbsp;and widely circulated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the accompanying cut we have endeavoured to realize this Jesuitical map, as we fear it must be called. The projection we&nbsp;have adopted is</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">a perspective of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the hemisphere,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">as viewed from</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">a point at the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">distance of one</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">diameter from</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the surface, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">situated on the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">production of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the radius which</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">passes through</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">vertex much more distant the desired effect would be impaired, and with one nearer neither of the poles would be seen, whilst the&nbsp;exaggeration of China would have been too gross for a professed&nbsp;representation of the hemisphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The chief facts of Ricci's career are derived from Trigault ; some contemporary-works on the rites controversy have also been consulted ; in the notice of Ricci's Chinese writings valuable matter has been derived from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Notes on Chinese Literature</span><span class="font0"> by Mr Λ. wylie,</span><span class="font1">@@</span><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> an indefatigable scholar, and perhaps our only contemporary who can speak of these from actual examination. The projection of the&nbsp;sphere by the present writer appeared in the (now defunct) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Geographical&nbsp;Magazine</span><span class="font0"> for July 1874. A number of Ricci's letters are extant in the possession&nbsp;of the family, and access to them was afforded to Giuseppe La Farina, author of&nbsp;the work called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">La China, considerata nella sua Storia,</span><span class="font0"> &lt;fcc., Florence, 1843, by&nbsp;the Marchese Amico Ricci of Macerata, living at Bologna (see vol. i. p. 112 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sg.).&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">La Farina’s quotations contain nothing of interest. There is a curious Chinese&nbsp;account of Ricci published by Dr Breitschneider in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">China Review,</span><span class="font0"> iv.&nbsp;391 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sq.</span><span class="font0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(H.
