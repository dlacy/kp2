<p><span class="font0">out at the foot. This is prevented by the tie-beam, and this excites a preſſure, by which they tend to compreſs&nbsp;each other. Suppoſe them without weight, and that a&nbsp;great weight is laid on the ridge B. This can be ſupported only by the butting of the rafters in their own&nbsp;directions A B and C B, and the weight tends to compreſs them in the oppoſite directions, and, through their&nbsp;intervention,, to ſtretch the tie-beam. If neither the&nbsp;rafters can be compreſſed, nor the tie-beam ſtretched, it&nbsp;is plain that the triangle ABC muſt retain its ſhape,&nbsp;and that B becomes a fixed point, very proper to be&nbsp;uſed as a point of ſuſpenſion. To this point, therefore, is the tie-beam ſuſpended by means of the king-poſt. A common ſpectator, unacquainted with carpentry, view's it very differently, and the tie-beam appears&nbsp;to him to carry the roof. The king-poſt appears a pillar reſting on the beam, wdιereas it is really a ſtring ; and&nbsp;an iron-rod of one-ſixteenth of the ſize would have done&nbsp;juſt as well. The king-poſt is ſometimes mortiſed into&nbsp;the tie-beam, and pins put through the joint, which&nbsp;gives it more the look of a pillar with the roof reſting&nbsp;on it. This does well enough in many cafes. But the&nbsp;beſt method is to connect them by an iron ſtrap, like a&nbsp;ſtirrup, which is bolted at its upper ends into the&nbsp;king-poſt, and paſſes round the tie-beam. In this way&nbsp;a ſpace is commonly left between the end of the king-poſt and the upper ſide of the tie-beam. Here the&nbsp;beam plainly appears hanging in the ſtirrup ; and this&nbsp;method allows us to reſtore the beam to an exact level,&nbsp;when it has funk by the unavoidable compreſſion or&nbsp;other yielding of the parts. The holes in the ſides of&nbsp;the iron ſtrap are made oblong inſtead of round ; and&nbsp;the bolt which is drawn through all is made to taper&nbsp;on the under fide; ſo that driving it farther draws the&nbsp;'tie-beam upwards. A notion of this may be formed&nbsp;by looking at fig. 16. which is a ſection of the poſt&nbsp;and beam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It requires conſiderable attention, however, to make this ſuſpenſion of the tie-beam ſuſſiciently firm. The&nbsp;top of the king-poſt is cut into the form of the arch-ſtone of a bridge, and the heads of the rafters are firm-'ly mortiſed into this projecting part. Theſe projections are called joggles, and are formed by working&nbsp;the king-poſt out of a much larger piece of timber, and&nbsp;cutting off the unneceffary wood from the two ſides ;&nbsp;and, left all this ſhould not be ſuſſicient, it is uſual&nbsp;in great works to add an iron-plate or ſtrap of three&nbsp;branches, wſhich are bolted into the heads of the king-poſt and rafters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The rafters, though not ſo long as the beam, ſeem to ſtand as much in need of ſomething to prevent their&nbsp;bending, for they carry the weight of the covering.—&nbsp;This cannot be done by ſuſpenſion, for we have no&nbsp;fixed points above them : But we have now got a very&nbsp;firm point of ſupport at the foot of the king-poſt.—&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Braces,</span><span class="font0"> or</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">firuts,</span><span class="font0"> ED, ED, (fig. 17.), are put under the&quot; middle of the rafters, where they are ſlightly&nbsp;mortiſed, and their lower ends are firmly mortiſed into&nbsp;joggles formed on the foot of the king-poſt. As theſe&nbsp;braces are very powerful in their reſiſtance to compreſe&nbsp;ſion, and the king-poſt equally ſo to refill extenſion, the&nbsp;points E and F may be conſidered as fixed ; and the&nbsp;rafters being thus reduced to half their former length,&nbsp;have now four times their former relative ſtrength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Roofs do not always conſiſt of two ſloping ſides meeting in a ridge. They have ſometimes </span><span class="font1">a flat </span><span class="font0">on the top, with two ſloping ſides. They are ſometimes formed&nbsp;with a double ſlope, and are called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">kirb</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manſarde&nbsp;roofs.</span><span class="font0"> They ſometimes have a valley in the middle,&nbsp;and are then called M roofs. Such roofs require another piece which may be called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">trufs beam</span><span class="font0"> becauſe&nbsp;all ſuch frames are called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">truffes,</span><span class="font0"> probably from the&nbsp;French word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">trouſfe,</span><span class="font0"> becauſe ſuch roofs are like portions of plain roofs, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">trouſſes</span><span class="font0"> or ſhortened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A flat-topped roof is thus conſtructed. Suppoſe the three rafters AB, BC, CD (fig. 18.) of which AB&nbsp;and CD are equal, and BC horizontal. It is plain&nbsp;that they will be in equilibrio, and the roof have no&nbsp;tendency to go to either fide. The tie-beam AD&nbsp;withſtands the horizontal thruſts of the whole frame,&nbsp;and the two rafters AB and CD are each preſſed in&nbsp;their own directions in conſequence of their butting&nbsp;with the middle rafter or truſs-beam BC. It lies between them like the keyſtone of an arch. They lean&nbsp;towards it, and it reſts on them. The preſſure&nbsp;which the truſs-beam and its load excites on the&nbsp;two rafters is the very ſame as if the rafters were produced till they meet in G, and a weight were laid on&nbsp;theſe equal to that of BC and its load. If therefore&nbsp;the truſs-beam is of a ſcantling ſuſſicient for carrying&nbsp;its own load, and withſtanding the compreſſion from&nbsp;the two rafters, the roof will be equally ſtrong (while it&nbsp;keeps its ſhape) as the plain roof AGD furniſhed with&nbsp;king-poſt and braces. We may conceive this another way. Suppoſe a plain roof AGD, without braces&nbsp;to ſupport the middle B and C of the rafters. Then&nbsp;let a beam BC be put in between the rafters, butting&nbsp;upon little notches cut in the rafters. It is evident&nbsp;that this muſt prevent the rafters from bending dowm-wards, becauſe the points B and C cannot deſcend, moving round the centres A and D, without ſhortening&nbsp;the diſtance BC between them. This cannot be&nbsp;without compreſſing the beam BC. It is plain that&nbsp;B C may be wedged in, or wedges driven in between&nbsp;its ends B and C and the notches in which it is&nbsp;lodged. Theſe wedges may be driven in till they even&nbsp;force out the rafters GA and GD. Whenever thi3&nbsp;happens, all the mutual preſſure of the heads of theſe&nbsp;rafters at G is taken away, and the parts GB and GC&nbsp;may be cut away, and the roof ABCD will be as ſtrong&nbsp;as the roof AGD furniſhed with the king-poſt and&nbsp;braces, becauſe the truſs-beam gives a ſupport of the&nbsp;ſame kind at B and C as the brace would have done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But this roof ABCD would have no firmneſs of ſhape. Any addition of weight on one ſide would de*&nbsp;ſtroy the equilibrium at the angle, would depreſs that&nbsp;angle, and cauſe the oppoſite one to riſe. To give it&nbsp;ſtiffneſs, it muſt either have ties or braces, or ſomething partaking of the nature of both. The uſual method of framing is to make the heads of the rafters&nbsp;butt on the joggles of two ſide-poſts BE and CF, while&nbsp;the truſs-beam, or ſtrut as it is generally termed by&nbsp;the carpenters, is mortiſed ſquare into the inſide ©f&nbsp;the heads. The lower ends E and F of the ſide-poſts&nbsp;are connected with the tie-beam either by mortiſes </span><span class="font1">or&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">ſtraps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This conſtruction gives firmneſs to the frame ; for the angle B cannot deſcend in conſequence of any inequality of preſſure, without forcing the other angle C&nbsp;to riſe. This it cannot do, being held down by the&nbsp;poſt CF. And the ſame conſtruction fortifies the tie-</span><span class="font1">beam, wſhich is now ſuſpended at the points E and </span><span class="font0">F</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
