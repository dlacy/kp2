<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font4"> “ It was only at that period I had know-ledge of it : all the correſpondence paſſed with the mi-ni ſters.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prof.</span><span class="font4"> “ You entruſted Dabancourt, the nephew oſ Calbnne, with the department oſ war ; and ſuch has&nbsp;been the ſucceſs oſ your conſpiracy, that the poſts oſ&nbsp;Longwy and Verdun were ſurrendered to the enemy at&nbsp;the moment oſ their appearance.—what have you to&nbsp;anſwer ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font4"> &quot; I did not know that Dabancourt was M. Calonne’s nephew. I have not diveſted the poſts. I&nbsp;would not have permitted myſelſ ſuch a thing. I know&nbsp;nothing of it, iſ ſt has been ſo.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preſ.</span><span class="font4"> &quot; You have deſtroyed our navy - a vaſt num-ber oſ officers belonging to that corps had cmigrated ;; there ſcarcely remained any to do duty in the harbours ;&nbsp;meanwhile Bertrand was granting paffports every day ;&nbsp;and when the legiſſative body repreſented to you his&nbsp;criminal conduct on the 8th oſ March, you anſwered,&nbsp;that you were ſatisſied with his ſervices.— what have&nbsp;you to anſwer ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font4"> “ I have done all I could to retain the officers. As to M. Bertrand, ſince the legiſſative affembly preſented no complaint againſt him that might have&nbsp;put him in a ſtate oſ accuſation, I did not think proper&nbsp;to turn him out oſ office.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prof.</span><span class="font4"> &quot; You have favoured the maintenance oſ abſolute government in the colonies ; your agents ſoment-ed troubles and counter-revolutions throughout them, which took place at the ſame epoch when it was to-have' been brought about in France, which indicates&nbsp;plainly that your hand laid this plot.—what have you.&nbsp;to anſwer ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font4"> &quot; If there are any oſ my agents in the co-lonies, they have not ſpoken the truth ; 1 had nothing to do with what you have juſt mentioned.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preof </span><span class="font4"><sup>a</sup> The interior oſ the ſtate was convulſed by fanatics ; you avowed yourſelf their protector, in mani-feſting your evident intention of recovering by them&nbsp;your ancient power.—what have you to anſwer ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font4"> “ I cannot anſwer to this ; I know nothing of ſuch a project.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preof</span><span class="font4"> &quot; The legiſſative body had paſſed a decree on the 29th of January againſt the factious prieſts ;&nbsp;you ſuſpended its execution.—what have you to an-ſwer ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font4"> “ The conſtitution referved to me the free ripht to refuſe my ſanction of the decrees.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>C</sup>'Preof</span><span class="font4"> &quot; The troubles had increafed ; the miniſter declared, that he knew no means in the laws extant to&nbsp;arraign the guilty. The legiſſative body enacted a freſh&nbsp;decree, which you likewiſe ſuſpended.—what have you&nbsp;to ſay to this ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[Louis replied in the ſame manner as in tlie preced-ing charge. J</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Pre/</span><span class="font4"> &quot; The uncitizen-like conduct of the guards whom the conſtitution had granted you, had rendered it&nbsp;neceffary to diſhand them.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font4"> &quot; I only continued them in pay till freſh ones could be raiſed, according to the tenor of the decree.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prefi</span><span class="font4"> “ You kept near your perſon the Swiſa-guards : the conſtitution forbade you this, aud the legiſlative affembly had expreſsly ordained their departure.—· what have you to anſwer ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font4"> &quot; I have executed all the decrees that have been enacted in this reſpect.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preof </span><span class="font4">“ You had private companies at Paris, char-ged to operate movements uſeful to your projects oſ a counter-revolution. Dangremont and Gilles were two&nbsp;of your agents, who had ſalaries from the civil lift.&nbsp;The receipts of G illes, who was ordered to raiſe a company of 60 men, ſhall be preſented to you.—what&nbsp;have you to anfwer ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Louis. “ I</span><span class="font4"> have no knowledge whatever of the pre-jects Taid to their charge : the idea of a counter-revolu· tion never entered into my mind.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preof</span><span class="font4"> - &quot; You wiſhed to ſuborn, with conſſderable ſums, ſeveral members oſ the legiſſative and conſtituent·&nbsp;affemblies.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Louis. </span><span class="font4">“ Several perſons preſented themfelves with ſſmilar decrees, but I have waved them ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preof</span><span class="font4"> “ who are they that preſented you with thoſe projects ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font4"> “ The plans were ſo vague that I do not recollect them now.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preof <sup>i(</sup></span><span class="font4">  who are thoſe to whom you gave money?’<sup>5</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font4"> &quot; I gave money to nobody.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preof</span><span class="font4"> &quot; You ſuffered the French name to be reviled in Germany, Italy, and Spain, fince you omitted to demand ſatisfaction for the bad treatment which the&nbsp;French ſuffered in thoſe countries.·—what have you to&nbsp;anſwer ? ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font4"> &quot; The diplomatical correſpondence will prove the contrary ; beſides, this was a concern of the miniſters.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preof</span><span class="font4"> “ You reviewed the Swiſs on thé 10th of Auguſt at ſive o’clock in the morning ; and the Swifs&nbsp;were the ſirſt who fired upon the citizens.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font4"> I'went on that day to review all the troops that were aſſembled about me ; the conſſſtuted authori-ties were with me, the department, the mayor, and municipality ; I had even invited thither a deputation of&nbsp;the national aſſembly, and- I aſterwards repaired into&nbsp;the midſt of them with my family.”</span></p>
