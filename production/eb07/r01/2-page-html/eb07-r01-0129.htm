When the young are first hatched they do not measure above six lines&nbsp;in diameter. Like most other tortoises, it may be tamed,&nbsp;and its love of slugs and snails makes it a useful adjunct to&nbsp;a garden. Yet it must be borne in mind, that however beneficial to the horticulturist, it is a dangerous inmate of the&nbsp;fish-pond, where it attacks and destroys the inhabitants,&nbsp;first biting them till they become enfeebled through loss of&nbsp;blood, and then dragging them to the bottom, where it&nbsp;quietly devours everything but the bones and some of the&nbsp;cartilaginous parts of the head. The air-bladder also is&nbsp;often left, and, swimming on the surface, gives notice of the&nbsp;depredation done below. The mud-tortoise walks with&nbsp;greater quickness and activity than the ordinary land spe</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The painted tortoise ( </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">T. picta)</span><span class="font0"> likewise pertains to this</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">genus. It is a beautiful little creature, with a smooth, rather Aattish shield, of a brown colour, and each compartment bordered by a yellow band. It is a North American species, often seen congregated in clear sunny weather along&nbsp;the sides of rivers on stones and trunks of fallen trees, from&nbsp;which it plunges into the water on the slightest disturbance.&nbsp;It swims swiftly, but walks slowly, and is said to be very&nbsp;voracious, sometimes even destroying ducklings, by seizing&nbsp;their feet and dragging them below the water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A few species with the neck more elongated (such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">T. Iongicollis,</span><span class="font0"> Shaw) form the genus Hydraspis of Bell. There&nbsp;are also some peculiar species called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tortues a boîte</span><span class="font0"> by the&nbsp;French, in which the plastron or lower shield is divided&nbsp;into two by a moveable articulation. These tortoises can&nbsp;close their carapace, and so shut themselves up as in a box,&nbsp;after having drawn in their head and legs. Such is the&nbsp;close tortoise </span><span class="font1">( </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">T.</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">clausa,</span><span class="font0"> Gmel.), so called on account of&nbsp;the peculiarity just alluded to. The shell is of great&nbsp;strength, and although the creature itself rarely exceeds a&nbsp;few inches in length, it remains uninjured under a weight of&nbsp;five or six hundred pounds. It occurs in different parts of&nbsp;North America, being usually found in marshy places, though&nbsp;sometimes seen in dry and sultry situations. It feeds on insects, mice, and even snakes, which it is said to seize by the&nbsp;middle, and crush to death by drawing them within its shell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Others have the tail and limbs by much too large to be withdrawn into the shell. Such is the long-tailed tortoise&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">( T. serpentina,</span><span class="font0"> Linn.), a fresh-water species, native to the&nbsp;warmer parts of North America, where it is known under&nbsp;the name of snapping turtle. It is of considerable size,&nbsp;sometimes weighing twenty pounds, and seizes upon its prey&nbsp;(fish, ducklings, &amp;c.) with great force and rapidity, stretching out its neck, and uttering a hissing sound. Its grasp&nbsp;is so tenacious that it will suffer itself to be lifted up by a&nbsp;stick rather than quit its hold. The tail is almost as long&nbsp;as the body, and is beset by sharp raised ridges. The plates&nbsp;of the shield assume a somewhat pyramidal form. See Plate&nbsp;CCCCXXX. fig. 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">GENUS CHELONIA, Brogn. Turtles, or sea-tortoises. This group differs from all the preceding in its long, flat, fin∙like&nbsp;feet, with the toes closely united, and enclosed within the&nbsp;membrane. The first two toes of each foot alone are furnished with nails, one or other of which often drops off at&nbsp;a certain term of life. The different portions of the lower&nbsp;shield do not form a continuous plate, but are variously&nbsp;dentated, and have large intervals covered by cartilage&nbsp;alone. The ribs are narrow, and separate from each other&nbsp;at their outer portion ; but the circumference of the shield&nbsp;is occupied throughout by a circle of pieces corresponding&nbsp;to the sternal ribs. The interior of the oesophagus is entirely beset by sharp cartilaginous points directed towards&nbsp;the stomach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To illustrate the prevailing habits of these curious creatures, we shall extract the following notices regarding se-</span></p><h2><a name="caption1"></a></h2>
<p><span class="font0">veral species of sea-turtle, from one of those delightful papers with which Mr Audubon has enlivened his Ornithological Biography. That gentleman’s observations were made chiefly among the Tortugas, a group of low uninhabitable islands, or rather banks of shelly sand, which lie&nbsp;about eighty miles from Key West, off the peninsula of the&nbsp;Floridas. As usual, the author intermingles his minuter&nbsp;notices of natural history with very pleasing sketches of&nbsp;the general features of the surrounding scene. “ If you&nbsp;have never seen the sun setting in those latitudes, I would&nbsp;recommend you to make a voyage for the purpose ; for I&nbsp;much doubt if, in any other portion of the world, the departure of the orb of day is accompanied by such gorgeous&nbsp;appearances. Look at the great red disk increased to triple&nbsp;its ordinary dimensions ! Now it has partially sunk beneath&nbsp;the distant line of waters, and with its still remaining half&nbsp;irradiates the whole heavens with a flood of golden light,&nbsp;purpling the far-off clouds that hover over the western horizon. A blaze of refulgent glory streams through the portals of the west, and the masses of vapour assume the semblance of mountains of molten gold. But the sun has now&nbsp;disappeared, and from the east slowly advances the gray&nbsp;curtain which night draws over the world.” “ Slowly advancing landward, their heads alone above water, are observed the heavily-laden turtles, anxious to deposit their&nbsp;eggs in the well-known sands. On the surface of the&nbsp;gently rippling stream, I dimly see their broad forms, as&nbsp;they toil along, while at intervals may be heard their hurried breathings, indicative of suspicion and fear. The moon,&nbsp;with her silvery light, now illumines the scene, and the&nbsp;turtle having landed, slowly and laboriously drags her heavy&nbsp;body over the sand, her ‘flappers’ being better adapted for&nbsp;motion in the water than on shore. Up the slope, however, she works her way, and see how industriously she removes the sand beneath her, casting it out on either side.&nbsp;Layer after layer she deposits her eggs, arranging them in&nbsp;the most careful manner, and, with her hind paddles, brings&nbsp;the sand over them. The business is accomplished, the&nbsp;spot is covered over, and with a joyful heart the turtle&nbsp;swiftly retires towards the shore, and launches into the&nbsp;deep.” “ There are four different species, which are known&nbsp;by the names of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">green turtle,</span><span class="font0"> the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hawk-bill turtle,</span><span class="font0"> the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">loggerhead-turtle,</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">trunk-turtle.</span><span class="font0"> The first is considered best as an article of food, in which capacity it is&nbsp;well known to most epicures. It approaches the shores,&nbsp;and enters the bays, inlets, and rivers, early in the month&nbsp;of April, after having spent the winter in the deep waters.&nbsp;It deposits its eggs in convenient places in two different&nbsp;times in May, and once again in June. The first deposit is&nbsp;the largest, and the last the least, the total quantity being&nbsp;at an average about two hundred and forty. The hawk-bill turtle, whose shell is so valuable as an article of commerce, being used for various purposes in the arts, is the&nbsp;next with respect to the quality of its flesh. It resorts to&nbsp;the outer keys only, where it deposits its eggs in two sets,&nbsp;first in July, and again in August, although it ‘ crawls’&nbsp;the beaches of these keys much earlier in the season, as if&nbsp;to look for a safe place. The average number of its eggs&nbsp;is about three hundred. The loggerhead visits the Tortu-gas in April, and lays from that period until late in June&nbsp;three sets of eggs, each set averaging a hundred and seventy. The trunk-turtle, which is sometimes of an enormous&nbsp;size, and which has a pouch like a pelican, reaches the&nbsp;shores latest. The shell and flesh are so soft, that one may&nbsp;push his finger into them, almost as into a lump of butter.&nbsp;This species, therefore, is considered as the least valuable,&nbsp;and indeed is seldom eaten, unless by the lndians, who,&nbsp;ever alert when the turtle season commences, first carry off&nbsp;the eggs, and afterwards catch the turtles themselves. The&nbsp;average number of eggs which it lays in the season, in two&nbsp;sets, may be three hundred and fifty.&quot;</span></p>
