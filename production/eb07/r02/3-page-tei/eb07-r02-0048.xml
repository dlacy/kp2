Ditches, he observes, only require to be so deep that the surface of the water in them may be a few inches below the level of the road ; the farmer often makes them dangerously deep, on account of the value of the mould that is dug out of them. Mr Macadam would prefer a bog to any other foundation for a road, provided that it would allow a man to walk over it; and he justly observes, that the resistance to the motion of a carriage would not be materially affected by the foundation, if the road were well made. From Bridgewater to Cross, a part of the road shakes when a carriage passes over it ; yet the consumption of materials is less there than on the limestone rock in the neighbourhood. He does not use any faggots in such cases, nor any stones larger than six ounces in weight ; and these never sink in the bog, but unite into one mass like a piece of timber, which rests on it. He makes such a road generally at three different times ; and he always prefers working in weather not very dry. The surveyors are directed to carry a pair of scales and a six-ounce weight in their pockets, as a check upon the workmen.</p><p>Mr Macadam has generally found reason to approve the usual regulation respecting carriage-wheels ; but he thinks broad wheels less advantageous to roads than is commonly supposed. He suggests that the tolls might always be fairly made proportional to the exact number of horses employed ; except that the waggoners should be encouraged to harness them in pairs rather than in a line. The conical form of broad wheels he thinks very injurious.</p><p>Clean flints from the sea-side are among the best materials for roads, and might often be procured cheap by canals ; granite chippings also, brought as ballast, are excellent; and when the middle of the road has been well made with good stones, the sides may often be left for a few feet less abundantly provided with them, as they are naturally much less exposed to wear.</p><p>Of the other evidence produced to the committee of the House of Commons, there is much that gives us valuable information respecting the economy of horses and carriages in general, and some that deserves to be noticed, as affording partial exceptions to the universal adoption of the system introduced by Mr Macadam.</p><p>Mr Waterhouse observes (p. 85), that stage-coach horses generally last about four years in the neighbourhood of London, and about six in remoter parts. He agrees with Mr Macadam, that a very slight convexity is better for a road than a greater ; that roads in wet situations often require underdraining; and that the gravel near London is too often uscd without being sufficiently cleaned. Mr Horne’s horses generally wear out in about three years. The “ light” coaches, with their loads, generally weigh about two tons and a half ; the coach one, the passengers one, and the luggage a half. The Uxbridge road, he says, is generally heavy, because it lies lower than the neighbouring land, and is not sufficiently drained. Mr Fames reports that the Guildford road is so much improved by the introduction of flints instead of gravel, that sixteen miles are as easily performed on it by his horses as twelve were before the alteration. Mr Farey explains the principle upon which some of the roads about London are watered in winter ; it is in order to soften the tenacious mud that is formed upon the surface, to prevent its adhering to the carriage-wheels, and to enable it to be scraped off with ease. He says that about Whitechapel it has been found very advantageous for the heavy traffic to have the middle of the road paved ; and he thinks tllat two lines of pavement, one on each side,</p><lb/><p>would be preferable to a single one, in order that the waggoners might walk' at the sides of the road, leaving the middle for lighter carriages. He would have a road fifty-five feet wide, elevated about twelve inches in the middle. Broad wheels, he thinks, are seldom so flat as to bear on their whole surface at once, being commonly rather conoidal than conical ; so that they differ less in their effect from narrower wheels than is commonly supposed. Mr Walker adheres to the old opinion, that in soft soils a road ought to be founded on bushes or “ bavins ;” that is, where they can be expected to remain always wet, so as not to be liable to a very speedy decay. He observes, that if a road does not possess some considerable convexity at first, it will wear concave, and collect mud ; the elevation, he thinks, should be about one thirtieth of the breadth. Mr Telford informs the committee (p. 188) that the declivity of the Welsh roads was formerly in many places one inch in ten ; and in some one in eight, and even one in six ; but that the modem road scarcely ever rises above an inch in thirty ; and that the utmost ascent in the whole line is one in seventeen for about two hundred yards. With respect to the weight of the stones, he agrees with Mr Macadam, that they ought not to exceed six or eight ounces ; and that gravel is best cleaned by riddling it repeatedly, and leaving it to dry in the intervals.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi>  III.—<hi rend="italic">Of the Roads of different Ages and Countries.</hi></p><p>The Romans appear to have been beyond comparison the greatest road-makers of the ancient or the modern world. The story told by Montaigne (iii. vi. p. 206) of a road in Peru, from Quito to Cuzco, 300 leagues long and twenty-five paces broad, made of stones ten feet square, with a running stream and a row of trees on each side, seems to have been considerably exaggerated ; and it is not very clear whether the stones he mentions were used for the road or for the houses of entertainment built at intervals by its side ; nor have the “ rocks cut through” and “ mountains levelled” been very particularly noticed by more recent travellers in that country. In Italy only, the Romans are said to have made more than 14,000 miles of road, w hich was generally executed with great care and labour ; and many of their roads still remain as the foundation of the most favourite routes of Italian travellers. The more than Roman despot of modern times was as much a Roman in his road-making as in the selfish character of his general policy ; and in proportion to the duration of his dynasty, he performed more than all the Appii and Flaminii of antiquity. Whatever his merits may have been, the beneficial effects of his measures remain ; and those who have profited by his improvements have no right to criticise his motives with too great severity.</p><p>Of the great roads diverging from the gates of ancient Rome, about twelve have been enumerated by antiquaries, and twelve more branched off from these at a small distance from the city ; eighteen others commenced in different parts of Italy, and in the whole there are at least fifty, which have been distinguished by appropriate names, without including the military roads through the distant provinces; such, for example, as in England were distinguished by the name of streets, of which many traces yet remain in different parts of the country.</p><p>Directly to the sea the Romans travelled by the Ostian road ; along its shores to the north-west by the Aurelian, and to the south-east by the Appian. Next within the Aurelian was the Flaminian, then the Salarian, the Nomen-tanian, the Tiburtine, the Prænestine, the Lavican, and the Latin ; and then the Appian, which was the most ancient of all, having been made as far as Capua, in the 442d year of the city, accompanied to a considerable distance by an aqueduct. The Aurelian road was made in the year 512 ; the Flaminian about 533.</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
