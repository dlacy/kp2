<p><span class="font1">cylindrical pillar, which may be taken out of its mould. Now suppose this pillar standing upright, and loaded above.&nbsp;The supports arising from the cement act obliquely, and&nbsp;the load tends either to force them asunder laterally, or to&nbsp;make them slide on each other : either of these things happening, the whole is crushed to pieces. The resistance of&nbsp;fibrous materials to such a strain is a little more intricate,&nbsp;but may be explained in a way very similar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A piece of matter of any kind may also be destroyed by wrenching or twisting it. We can easily form a notion of&nbsp;its resistance to this kind of strain by considering what&nbsp;would happen to the cylinder of small shot if treated in this&nbsp;way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And, lastly, a beam, or a bar of metal, or piece of stone or other matter, may be broken transversely. This will&nbsp;happen to a rafter or joist supported at the ends when&nbsp;overloaded, or to a beam having one end stuck fast in a wall&nbsp;and a load laid on its projecting part. This is the strain&nbsp;to which materials are most commonly exposed in roofs ;&nbsp;and, unfortunately, it is the strain which they are the least&nbsp;able to bear ; or rather it is the manner of application which&nbsp;causes an external force to excite the greatest possible immediate strain on the particles. It is against this that tile&nbsp;carpenter must chiefly guard, avoiding it when in his power,&nbsp;and in every case diminishing it as much as possible. It is&nbsp;necessary to give the reader a clear notion of the great weakness of materials in relation to this transverse strain. But&nbsp;we shall do nothing more, referring him to the articles&nbsp;Strain, and Stress, and Strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let ABCD (fig. 1) represent the side of a bcam projecting horizontally from a wall in which it is firmly fixed,&nbsp;and let it be loaded with a&nbsp;weight W appended to its extremity. This tends to break&nbsp;it j and the least reflection&nbsp;will convince any person, that&nbsp;if the beam is equally strong&nbsp;throughout, it will break in&nbsp;the line CD, even with the&nbsp;surface of the wall. It will&nbsp;open at D, while C will serve&nbsp;as a sort of joint, round which&nbsp;it will turn. The cross section through the line CD is&nbsp;for this reason called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">section offracture ;</span><span class="font1"> and the horizontal line drawn through&nbsp;C on its under surface is called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">axis t&gt;f fracture.</span><span class="font1"> The&nbsp;fracture is made by tearing asunder the fibres, such as DE&nbsp;or FG. Let us suppose a real joint at C, and that the&nbsp;beam is really sawed through along CD, and that in place&nbsp;of its natural fibres, threads are substituted all over the section of fracture. The weight now tends to break these&nbsp;threads, and it is our business to find the force necessary&nbsp;for this purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is evident that DCA may be considered as a bended lever, of which C is the fulcrum. If </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font1"> be the force which&nbsp;will just balance the cohesion of a thread when hung on it&nbsp;so that the smallest addition will break it, we may find the&nbsp;weight which will be sufficient for this purpose when hung&nbsp;on at A, by saying, AC : CD </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">—f: φ,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">φ</span><span class="font1"> will be the&nbsp;weight which will just break tlιe thread, by hanging </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">φ</span><span class="font1"> by&nbsp;CD</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the point A. This gives us </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">φ = f × -~-τ∙</span><span class="font1"> If the weight</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h6><span class="font2">LA</span></h6>
<p><span class="font1">be hung on at </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a,</span><span class="font1"> the force just sufficient for breaking the CD</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">same thread will be =∕× In like manner, the force </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">φ, </span><span class="font1">which must be hung on at A in order to break an equally</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">CF</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">strong or an equally resisting fibre at F, must be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">=f ×</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And so on of all the rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If we suppose all the fibres to exert equal resistances at the instant of fracture, we know, from the simplest elements&nbsp;of mechanics, that the resistance of all the particles in the&nbsp;line CD, each acting equally in its own place, is the same&nbsp;as if all the individual resistances were united in the middle&nbsp;point </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">g.</span><span class="font1"> Now this total resistance is the resistance or&nbsp;strength </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font1"> of each particle, multiplied by the number of&nbsp;particles. This number may be expressed by the line CD,&nbsp;because we have no reason to suppose that they are at unequal distances. Therefore, in comparing different sections&nbsp;together, the number of particles in each are as the sections&nbsp;themselves. Therefore DC may represent the number of&nbsp;particles in the line DC. Let us call this line the depth of&nbsp;the beam, and express it by the symbol </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d.</span><span class="font1"> And since we&nbsp;are at present treating of roofs whose rafters and other parts&nbsp;are commonly of uniform breadth, let us call AH or BI the&nbsp;breadth of the beam, and express it by Z&gt;, and let CA be&nbsp;called its length Z. We may now express the strength of&nbsp;the whole line CD by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">f × d,</span><span class="font1"> and we may suppose it all&nbsp;concentrated in the middle point </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">g.</span><span class="font1"> Its mechanical energy,&nbsp;therefore, by which it resists the energy of the weight </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">w,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">applied at the distance Z, is</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">f×</span><span class="font1"> CD × C </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">g,</span><span class="font1"> whilst the momentum of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font1"> is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">wχ</span><span class="font1"> CA. We must therefore have </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font1"> X CD × </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cg&nbsp;= w×</span><span class="font1"> C A, or ∕&lt;Z × ½&lt;Z = teZ, and</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fd∙.w = l</span><span class="font1"> : ½&lt;Z, or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fd∙.w&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">= 2 Z : &lt;Z. That is, twice the length of the beam is to its&nbsp;depth as the absolute strength of one of its vertical planes&nbsp;to its relative strength, or its power of resisting this transverse fracture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is evident, that what has been now demonstrated of the resistance exerted in the line CD, is equally true of&nbsp;every line parallel to CD in the thickness or breadth of the&nbsp;beam. The absolute strength of the whole section of fracture is represented by</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fdb,</span><span class="font1"> and we still have 2 Z : rZ= ∕iZZ</span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font1"> : </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">w ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or twice the length of the beam is to its depth as the absolute strength to the relative strength. Suppose the beam&nbsp;twelve feet long and one foot deep ; then whatever be its&nbsp;absolute strength, the twenty-fourth part of this will break&nbsp;it if hung at its extremity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But even this is too favourable a statement. All the fibres are supposed to act alike in the instant of fracture. But&nbsp;this is not true. At the instant that the fibre at D breaks,&nbsp;it is stretched to the utmost, and is exerting its whole force.&nbsp;But at this instant the fibre at </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font1"> is not so much stretched,&nbsp;and it is not then exerting its utmost force. If we suppose&nbsp;the extension of the fibres to be as their distance from C,&nbsp;and the actual exertion of each to be as their extensions, it&nbsp;may easily be shown (see Strength and Strain), that the&nbsp;whole resistance is the same as if the full force of all the&nbsp;fibres were united at a point </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font1"> distant from C by one third&nbsp;of CD. In this case we must say, that the absolute strength&nbsp;is to the relative strength as three times the length to the&nbsp;depth ; so that the beam is weaker than by the former&nbsp;statement in the proportion of two to three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Even this is more strength than experiment justifies, and we can see an evident reason for it. When the beam&nbsp;is strained, not only are the upper fibres stretched, but the&nbsp;lower fibres are compressed. This is very distinctly seen,&nbsp;if we attempt to break a piece of cork cut into the shape&nbsp;of a beam. This being the case, C is not the centre of fracture. There is some point c which lies between the fibres&nbsp;which are stretched and those that are compressed. This&nbsp;fibre is neither stretched nor squeezed, and this point is&nbsp;the real centre of fracture ; and the lever by which a fibre&nbsp;D resists, is not DC, but a shorter one Dc, and the energy of the whole resistances must be less than by the second statement. Till we know the proportion between the&nbsp;dilatability and compressibility of the parts, and the relation</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
