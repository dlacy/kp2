They have a diameter of    inch when at rest</p><p>and globular. They are far less numerous than the red corpuscles ; the proportion of white and red corpuscles in various conditions is shown in the following table :—</p><table><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>In the morning fasting state................</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>.................1 :716</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Half an hour after breakfast.......... ......</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>................1 : 347</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Three hours after breakfast.................</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>.................1 :1514</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>In the splenic vein..........................</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>.................1 : 60</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>In the splenic artery...........................</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>..................1:2260</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>In the hepatic vein............................</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>................1 :170</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>In the portal vein...............................</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>..................1:740</p></cell></row></table><p>In addition to typical white and red corpuscles there are others, provisionally called <hi rend="italic">intermediate corpuscles, red granular corpuscles, or hæmatoblasts,</hi>  which are granular and nucleated. Probably these corpuscles are involved in a special manner in the development of the fibrin-ferment. It has been calculated that one cubic millimetre (f.c., a cube whose side measures about ∙∕<hi rend="sub">κ</hi>  inch) contains five million corpuscles of all kinds.</p><p>The chief constituents of the blood may now be discussed seriatim :—</p><p><hi rend="italic">Constituents of the Liquor Sanguinis.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Fibrin.—</hi>When fresh this is an elastic substance belonging to the group of proteid bodies ; it is insoluble in pure water, but is soluble in solutions of common salt and in dilute hydrochloric acid at the temperature of the body. Human venous blood yields from 2<hi rend="sup">,</hi>2 to 2'8 parts per</p><p>thousand of fibrin. So far</p><p>as we know, fibrin does</p><p>not exist as such in the</p><p>plasma before it is coagu</p><p>lated; but there does exist</p><p>a body, fibrinogen, which</p><p>is the precursor of fibrin.</p><p>It may be separated from</p><p>plasma by diluting the</p><p>plasma freely with water</p><p>at an ice-cold tempera</p><p>ture, and passing for a</p><p>long time a stream of CO<hi rend="sub">2</hi></p><p>through it ; or by adding</p><p>common salt to plasma</p><p>until the plasma contains</p><p>12 to 16 per cent, of salt</p><p>the fibrinogen is precipitated in a flaky form. Besides fibrinogen, liquor sanguinis contains another proteid body intimately concerned in the formation of fibrin ; this is <hi rend="italic">serum-globulin</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">para-globulin. </hi>It also may be precipitated from diluted plasma by a stream of CO, ; but it may be much more perfectly eliminated by adding magnesium sulphate until the plasma is saturated. It is a body the presence of which greatly facilitates or promotes the development of fibrin from fibrinogen ; indeed some observers have supposed that fibrin arises in the union of the two bodies fibrinogen and para-globulin.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Serum-albumin.—</hi>This is a proteid body which coagulates on heating.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Certain extractive matters.—</hi>These include neutral fats, lecithin, and cholesterin ; sugar ; urea, uric acid, creatine, creatinine, &amp;c. ; and a yellow pigment.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Inorganic Salts.—</hi>These are the chlorides, phosphates, and sulphates of sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium ; sodium and chlorides are the main constituents.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Gases.—</hi>Especially CO<hi rend="sub">2</hi>  ; but see below.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Constituents of the Red Corpuscles.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Oxyhæmoglobin.—</hi>This interesting substance has the general chemical composition of an albuminous body with the addition of the element iron:—C, 54Ό0; H, 7'25 ; N, 16<hi rend="sup">-</hi>25 ; Γe, 0'42 ; S, 0∙63 ; 0, 21∙45 = 100O0.</p><p>It is the cause of the red colour of the corpuscles. It may be obtained in the form of beautiful crystals by a variety of methods, which all have the following steps in common :—(1) to effect the solution of the oxy</p><p>hæmoglobin of the</p><p>red corpuscles in the</p><p>serum or in water,</p><p>and (2) to effect the</p><p>crystallization of it</p><p>from solution either</p><p>by adding alcohol, or</p><p>by cold, or by both</p><p>combined. Theforms</p><p>of the crystals differ</p><p>in different animals ;</p><p>the chief forms are</p><p>given in fig. 9. Oxy</p><p>hæmoglobin has the</p><p>property of giving</p><p>up a portion of its</p><p>oxygen on very slight</p><p>provocation, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi></p><p>when treated with</p><p>easily oxidizable sub</p><p>stances, or when sub</p><p>mitted to moderate</p><p>heat in a vacuum.</p><p>The resulting sub</p><p>stance is called re</p><p>duced hæmoglobin</p><p>or, shortly, hæmo</p><p>globin ; it is capable</p><p>of reproducing the</p><p>original oxyhæmo</p><p>globin on simple ex</p><p>posure to oxygen or</p><p>to air. This property</p><p>is of the highest im</p><p>portance in the func</p><p>tion of respiration, as will be explained in the section on the gases of the blood.</p><p>Solutions of oxyhæmoglobin of moderate strength have the fine scarlet hue of arterial blood. When interposed between the sun and a spectroscope they cause the absorption of definite portions of the spectrum, and give a characteristic appearance to it. After the solution has been reduced (as it may be very readily by means of an alkaline solution of a ferrous salt, in which precipitation of ferrous hydrate is prevented by the presence of tartaric or citric acid), it assumes a brownish colour and the absorption spectrum becomes changed. The spectra of oxyhæmoglobin and of reduced hæmoglobin when the solutions are of moderate strength are given in fig. 10.</p></body></text></TEI>
