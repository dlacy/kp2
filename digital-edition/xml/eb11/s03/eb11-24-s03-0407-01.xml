Proceedings in <hi rend="italic">scire facias</hi> are regarded as an action, and the defendant may plead his defense as in an action. The writ is now of little practical importance; its principal uses are to compel the appearance of corporations aggregate in revenue suits, and to enforce judgments against shareholders in such companies as are regulated by the Companies Clauses Act 1845, or similar private acts, and against garnishees in proceedings in foreign attachment in the lord mayor’s court. Proceedings by <hi rend="italic">scire facias</hi> to repeal letters patent for inventions were abolished by the Patents,»Designs and Trademarks Act 1883, and a petition to the court substituted. It is not used in Scottish procedure.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
