<p><span class="font2">company of the </span><span class="font1">great, appearing </span><span class="font2">to have </span><span class="font1">given up all his whimſies, and affecting neither the character of a&nbsp;philoſopher nor a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bel eſprit.</span><span class="font1"> He died of an apoplexy&nbsp;at Ermenon-ville, belonging to the marquis de Girardin,&nbsp;about ten leagues from Paris, July 2. 1778, aged 66&nbsp;years. This nobleman has erected to his memory a&nbsp;very plain monument, in a grove of poplars, which con-ftitutes part of his heautifnl gardens. On the tomb are&nbsp;iaſcribed the following epitaphs :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Id repoſe</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">D </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Homme de la Nature Et de la Rente !</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hie j accent OJſa Jf. jl. Rouſſeau.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The curious who go to ſee this tomb likewiſe ſee the cloak which the Genevan philoſopher wore. Above&nbsp;the door is inſcribed the following ſentence, which&nbsp;might afford matter for a whole book : “ He is truly&nbsp;free, who, to accompliſh his pleaſure, has no need of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the aſſiſlance of a fécond perſonl”</span><span class="font1"> Rouſſeau, during his&nbsp;ftay in the environs of Lyons, married Mademoiselle le&nbsp;Vaſſeur, his governeſs, a woman who, without either&nbsp;beauty or talents, had gained over him a great aſcen-dancy. She waited on him in health and in ſickneſs :&nbsp;But as if ſhe had been jealous of poſſeſſing him alone,&nbsp;ſhe drove from his mind, by the moſt perfidious iniinu-ations, all thoſe who came to entertain him ; and when&nbsp;Rouſſeau did not diſmiſs them, ſhe prevented their return by invariably refufing them admittance. By theſe&nbsp;means ſhe the more eaſily led her huſhand into incon-ſiſtencies of conduct, which the originality of his character as well as of his opinions ſo much contributed&nbsp;to aſſiſt. Nature had perhaps but given him the embryo of his character, and art had probably united to&nbsp;make it more fingular. He did not incline to aſſociate&nbsp;with any perſon ; and as this method of thinking and&nbsp;living was uncommon, it procured him a name, and he&nbsp;difplayed a kind of fantaſticalneſs in his behaviour and&nbsp;his writings. Like Diogenes of old, he united Simplicity of manners with all the pride of genius ; and a&nbsp;large ſtock of indolence, with an extreme ſenlibility, ſerved to render his character ſtill more uncommon. “ An&nbsp;indolent mind (ſays he), terrified at every application, a&nbsp;warm, bilious, and irritable temperament, ſenſible alſo in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font1">high degree to every thing that can affect it, appear&nbsp;not poſſible to be united in the ſame perſon : and yet&nbsp;theſe two contrarieties compoſe the chief of mine. An&nbsp;active life has no charms for me. I would an hundred&nbsp;times rather conſent to be idle than to do any thing&nbsp;againſt my will ; and I have an hundred times thought&nbsp;that I would live not amiſs in the Baſtille, provided I&nbsp;had nothing to do but juſt continue there. In my&nbsp;younger days I made ſeveral attempts to get in there ;&nbsp;but as they were only with the view of procuring a refuge and reſt in my old age, and, like the exertions of&nbsp;an indolent pa<sup>v</sup>fon, only by fits and ftarts, they were&nbsp;»ever attended with the ſmalleſt ſucceſs. When misfortunes came, they afforded me a pretext of giving&nbsp;myſelf up to my ruling paſſion.” He often exaggerated&nbsp;his misfortunes to himſelf as well as to others. He endeavoured particularly to render intereſting by his description his misfortunes and his poverty, although the&nbsp;former were ſar leſa than he imagined, and notwith-ftanding he had certain reſources againſt the latter. In <sup>1&nbsp;</sup>other refpects he was charitable, generous, ſober, juſt, '&nbsp;contenting himſelf with what was purely neceſſary, and&nbsp;refufing the means which might have procured him&nbsp;wealth and offices. He cannot, like many other ſo-phiſts, be accuſed oſ having often repeated with a ſtudied emphafis the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dir tue,</span><span class="font1"> without inſpiring the&nbsp;ſentiment. When he is ſpeaking of the duties of mankind, of the principles neceſſary to our happineſs, of&nbsp;the duty we owe to ourſelves and to our equals, it is&nbsp;with a copiouſneſs, a charm, and an impetuofity, that&nbsp;could only proceed from the heart. He ſaid one day&nbsp;to M. de Buffon, “ You have aſſerted and proved before&nbsp;J. J. Rouſſeau that mothers ought to ſuckle their children.” “ Yes (ſays this great naturaliſt), we have all&nbsp;ſaid ſo ; but M. Rouſſeau alone forbids it, and cauſes&nbsp;himſelf to be obeyed.” Another academician ſaid, “ that&nbsp;the virtues of Voltaire were without heart, and thoſe of&nbsp;Rouſſeau without head.” He was acquainted at an&nbsp;early age with the works of the Greek and Roman authors ; and the republican virtues there held forth to&nbsp;view, the rigorous auſterity of Cato, Brutus, &amp;c. carried him beyond the limits of a ſimple eſtimation of&nbsp;them. Influenced by his imagination, he admired&nbsp;every thing in the ancients, and ſaw nothing in his contemporaries but enervated minds and degenerated bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His ideas about politics were almoſt as eccentric as· his paradoxes about religion. Some reckon his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Social&nbsp;Compaft,</span><span class="font1"> which Voltaire calls the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Unſocial Compact,</span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;greateſt effort his genius produced. Others find it full&nbsp;of contradictions, errors, and cynical paſſages, obſcure,&nbsp;ilharranged, and </span><span class="font2">by </span><span class="font1">no means worthy of his ſhining&nbsp;pen. There are ſeveral other ſmall pieces wrote by&nbsp;him, to be found.in a collection of his works publiſhed&nbsp;in 25 vols 8vo and 12mo, to which there is appended&nbsp;a very inſignificant ſupplement in 6 vols.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The moſt uſeful and moſt important truths in this collection are picked out in his Thoughts; in which the&nbsp;confident ſophiſt and the impious author diſappear, and&nbsp;nothing is offered to the reader but the eloquent writer&nbsp;and the contemplative moraliſt. There were found in&nbsp;his port-folio his Conſeſſions, in twelve books ; the firſt&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">fix </span><span class="font1">oſ-which were publiſhed. “ In the preface to theſe&nbsp;memoirs, which abound with characters well drawn, and&nbsp;written with warmth, with energy, and ſometimes with&nbsp;elegance, he declares (ſays M. Paliſſot), like a peeviſh&nbsp;miſanthrope, who boldly introduces himſelf on the ruins&nbsp;of the world, to declare to mankind, whom he ſuppoſes&nbsp;aſſembled upon theſe ruins, that in that innumerable&nbsp;multitude, none could dare to ſay, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">I am better than that&nbsp;man.</span><span class="font1"> This affectation of ſeeing himſelf alone in the&nbsp;univerſe, and of continually directing every thing to&nbsp;himſelf, may appear to ſome moroſe minds a fanaticiſm&nbsp;of pride, of which we have no examples, at leaſt ſince&nbsp;the time of Cardan.” But this is not the only blame&nbsp;which may be attached to the author of the Conſeſſions.&nbsp;With uneaſmeſs we ſee him, under the pretext of fin-cerity, diſſionouring the character of his benefactreſs&nbsp;Lady Warren. There are innuendos no leſs oſſenfive&nbsp;againſt obſcure and celebrated characters, which ought&nbsp;entirely or partly to have feeen ſuppreſſed. A lady of&nbsp;wit ſaid, that Rouſſeau would have been held in higher&nbsp;eſtimation for virtue, “ had he died without his confeſ-</span><span class="font2">ſion.” </span><span class="font1">The ſame opinion is entertained by M. Senne-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
