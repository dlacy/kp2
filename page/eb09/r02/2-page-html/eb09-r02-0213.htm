<p><span class="font0">Galien le Khetori.—T[\vi romance was first printed in 1500. It is partly of late composition, although sufficiently ancient to have&nbsp;rendered the word “rhetoré” (ι.c., rhetorized, or narrated in elegant&nbsp;prose) incomprehensible at the time of its impression. The word&nbsp;was supposed to mean “restored,’ and to indicate the restoration&nbsp;of chivalry by Galien. The chief substance of the story was the&nbsp;ancient tide of Charlemagne’s journey to the East and the Turpin&nbsp;Chronicle. Hugues, emperor of Constantinople, at first receives the&nbsp;Frankish emperor and his peers courteously, but is informed by a&nbsp;spy of certain vaunting expressions to which, as is the Frankish&nbsp;manner, they have given utterance amongst themselves after supper.&nbsp;These “gabes,” as they are called, are merely frolicsome braggadocio,&nbsp;spoken in lightheartedness, and not intended to convey any serious&nbsp;intention. The spy and the Greek emperor, however, take them&nbsp;as the threats of dangerous magicians ; the Franks are seized and&nbsp;menaced with death if they fail to fulfil their words. Oliver is&nbsp;first put to the test ; his speech had had reference to the Greek&nbsp;princess Jacqueline, and might better have befitted the lips of a&nbsp;Parisian gamin of to-day than of a young paladin. He, however,&nbsp;awakens a tender interest in the lady’s heart, and she indulgently&nbsp;informs her father the next morning that the knight’s boast has&nbsp;been fulfilled. Hugues requires that the others shall also exhibit&nbsp;their power, which they do to his satisfaction, partly by celestial&nbsp;succour and partly by the use of mother-wit. He finally dismisses&nbsp;them with presents. After Oliver has gone, Jacqueline becomes&nbsp;the mother of Galien, who grows up in time to hear of the expedition to Spain and to arrive just too late for the battle in the&nbsp;pass of Roncesvalles. His dying father there acknowledges him,&nbsp;and Galien signalizes himself in the renewed fighting in which&nbsp;Charlemagne takes reprisals for the loss of his peers and the&nbsp;treachery of Ganelon. After various deeds of valour in the West,&nbsp;Galien returns to the East, saves his mother from a shameful death,&nbsp;and resumes the imperial crown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Milles et Amys.—The prose romance in its existing form was written in the 15th century, and first printed by Vérard about&nbsp;1503. The martyrdom of the two friends is supposed to have&nbsp;taken place in 774 in Charlemagne’s war against the Lombards, and&nbsp;their story was popularly current in the 12th century. Milles was&nbsp;the son of Anceaume, count of Clermont, and Amis the son of the&nbsp;count’s seneschal. Milles’s parents celebrate his birth by making&nbsp;a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. During their adventures and captivity&nbsp;in the East Milles is robbed of his inheritance at home and&nbsp;Amys is brought up under a feigned name. They enter into the&nbsp;closest friendship and set out for Constantinople, where Milles&nbsp;discovers his captive mother acting as nurse to the Greek princess&nbsp;Sidoine, whom by her assistance he weds, after having taken a&nbsp;chief part in forcing the sultan of Acre to raise the siege of Constantinople. He becomes emperor of Byzantium, but after a while&nbsp;returns to France with Amys, regains possession of his estates,&nbsp;and makes Amys a duke. Hearing that the Saracens have again&nbsp;attacked Constantinople and that his Greek wife has perished in&nbsp;the flames, he allows himself to be seduced by Bellisant, the&nbsp;daughter of Charlemagne, who, however, makes an honest man&nbsp;of him by marriage and behaves honourably ever after. Amys also&nbsp;gets married. Then the two friends also go on a pilgrimage to&nbsp;Jerusalem, from which Amys returns stricken with leprosy. His&nbsp;wife refuses to receive him, but he is carefully tended by Milles&nbsp;in his own castle ; and now the most striking episode in the story&nbsp;takes place. Amys learns in a dream that lie can only be healed&nbsp;by bathing in the blood of his friend’s offspring and tells Milles of&nbsp;it. The latter is painfully affected, but does not hesitate to strike&nbsp;off the heads of his two children. Amys is cured and the devotion&nbsp;of Milles repaid by a miracle from heaven : the children’s heads&nbsp;are replaced upon their shoulders. Afterwards Milles and Amys&nbsp;set out on another pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostella. Ogier&nbsp;the Dane, then at war with Charlemagne, meets and treacherously&nbsp;slays them on their way homeward. A continuation follows, narrating the adventures of the infant children of Milles. The widow&nbsp;of Amys plots for their destruction, but they are zealously tended&nbsp;by a wise ape, which shares their fortunes until separated from&nbsp;them by malice and mishap. Florisset becomes a Saracen leader&nbsp;hi Venice and Anceaume a brave warrior in the army of Charlemagne. The two brothers have a desperate encounter in the war&nbsp;which takes place, but are recognized by the ape (which has&nbsp;already brought about the punishment of the wicked widow of&nbsp;Amys, in a similar fashion to that of the celebrated dog of Mont-argis). A restoration takes place : the two young men are acknowledged the emperor’s grandsons, and the ape dies of joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jourdain dx Blaves (or de Βlaye).—The prose romance, first printed in 1520, is altered from a 15th-century poem. It is affiliated to Milles et Amys, the hero being the grandson of Amys. He&nbsp;undergoes the most varied fortunes : he throws his wife with his yet&nbsp;unborn child into the sea, enclosed in a box, when the vessel bearing himself and his warriors is in peril of shipwreck ; he searches&nbsp;for her some years later, and finds her in a refuge, to which she&nbsp;has fled from the love of the man who fished her out of the sea,&nbsp;and who exposed her baby-girl at the birth ; and next, when hunting in a forest, he finds his daughter running wild in company&nbsp;with a bitch and her young. This is a reflexion of the story of&nbsp;Apollonius of Tyre, and is rather a dull work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Doon of Mayence. —Doon or Doolin of Mayence is the hero of a 14th-century poem, adapted as a prose romance in the 15th century, first printed by Vérard in 1501. He is represented as defying&nbsp;and almost defeating his lord the emperor, whom he treats at first&nbsp;with disrespect. In his earlier history he appears as a son of Gui&nbsp;of Mayence, who, as penance for an unintentional crime, retires to&nbsp;a hermitage. On his disappearance his wife is accused of murder,&nbsp;condemned to death, and her children banished. Doon meets his&nbsp;father and returns to fight as his mother’s champion, conquers his&nbsp;enemies, and assumes his rightful possessions. He falls in love&nbsp;with a Saracen princess and wins her by force, with the help of&nbsp;Charlemagne, after the episode of his quarrel with the emperor.&nbsp;The lady’s father has been aided by the king of Denmark ; Doon,&nbsp;after his victory, seizes the Danish crown, which he transmits&nbsp;through his son Geoffrey to his grandson Ogier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ogier le Danois.—There are twelve chansons upon the story of this hero, dating from the 12th and 13th centuries, and based&nbsp;upon still older poems now lost. The trouvères Raimbert and&nbsp;Adenez le Roi were among the authors. The story was recomposed&nbsp;in prose, from the poem of the latter writer, probably in the second&nbsp;half of the 14th century. The fairies who preside at Ogier’s birth&nbsp;and endow him with many gifts are a later addition to the story ;&nbsp;one of them is Morgan la Fay, King Arthur’s sister, who foretells&nbsp;that at the end of his career he shall go to live with her in immortal youth at Avalon. While yet a little boy he is sent as a&nbsp;hostage to Charlemagne and is brought up at the imperial court.&nbsp;When fourteen years of age he is banished to the castle of St&nbsp;Omer, where he falls in love with the young châtelaine, but is&nbsp;soon afterwards ordered out of his prison to accompany Charlemagne on an expedition to Italy against the invading Saracens.&nbsp;Here, for the first time, he is subjected to the hatred and envy of&nbsp;young Chariot, the emperor’s son ; but on the triumph of the&nbsp;Frankish arms he accompanies the monarch in his return to Paris&nbsp;and learns that his father is dead and that the châtelaine has borne&nbsp;him a son. He departs to assume the crown of Denmark, but lays&nbsp;it down after a few years and returns to Charlemagne. His son&nbsp;has grown up and is one day engaged in a game of chess with&nbsp;Chariot, who, having lost it, becomes irritated, and kills him with&nbsp;the chess-board (an incident frequently met with in old fiction).&nbsp;Ogier, in his fury for revenge, uses such language that he is compelled to fly, and betakes himself to the court of the Lombard&nbsp;king Desiderius, then at war with the emperor. It is on this&nbsp;occasion that the famous dialogue takes place on the walls of Pavia.&nbsp;Desiderius or Didier wonders, as he and Ogier look forth together,&nbsp;at the great number of the Frankish warriors advancing over the&nbsp;plain, and, as each successive body of troops, ever increasing in&nbsp;strength and grandeur, makes its appearance, he says, “ Is this the&nbsp;emperor ? ” Ogier to each question answers, “ Not yet,” till at last&nbsp;he cries, “ When thou shalt see the fields bristling with an iron&nbsp;harvest, and the Po and the Ticino, swollen with sea-floods, inundating the walls of the city with iron billows, then perhaps shall&nbsp;Karl be nigh at hand.” Soon after the Iron Emperor with his&nbsp;mightiest host darkens the horizon, and Didier falls smitten with&nbsp;terror. The Lombard king is beaten ; Ogier is made prisoner while&nbsp;sleeping, and brought to the emperor. He still refuses to be reconciled until the monarch yields Chariot to his revenge. Charlemagne at last gives way ; Ogier, when just on the point of striking&nbsp;off the prince’s head, abstains, and foregoes his vengeance. Then,&nbsp;returning to his old station as one of the emperor’s chief paladins,&nbsp;he fights an invading army and slays their giant leader. He next&nbsp;saves the king of England’s daughter Clarice from captivity,&nbsp;marries her, and is recognized as king of that country ; but he&nbsp;abandons for a second time the kingly dignity and sets out for&nbsp;the conquest of the Holy Land. Whilst returning to France, he&nbsp;is shipwrecked, comes upon a diamond castle, invisible by day,&nbsp;and finds himself in Avalon in the company of Morgan la Fay.&nbsp;She puts the ring of perpetual youth on his finger, the crown of&nbsp;forgetfulness on his head, and he lives a life of joy for two centuries. Then the crown is taken off ; he remembers his old life,&nbsp;and betakes himself to the new and degenerate French kingdom&nbsp;which has succeeded to the empire of Charlemagne. After restoring the spirit of the older knighthood, vanquishing the Norse&nbsp;invaders, and passing through some curious adventures in connexion with his ring, he is carried away by Morgan la Fay and&nbsp;disappears for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meurvin.—This was a romance of late origin, first printed at Paris in 1531. Meurvin was the son of Ogier by Morgan la Fay,&nbsp;and is a personage of little interest, except for his connexion with&nbsp;the romance of the Knight of the Swan, whose ancestor he is represented to be through his son Oriant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Four Sons of Aymon ; or Regηault de Montαuban and his Three Brothers.—This, one of the most popular and delightful of&nbsp;the romances of this cycle, was printed many times in the 15th&nbsp;and 16th centuries, and in later abridgments as a chap-book.</span></p>
