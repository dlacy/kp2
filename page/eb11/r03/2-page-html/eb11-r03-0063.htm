                hand; and this accounts for the large size of the&nbsp;hoop of these rings. In the
                15th and 16th centuries bishops&nbsp;often wore three or four rings on the right
                hand in addition&nbsp;to a large jewel which was fixed to the back of each
                glove.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The papal “ Ring of the Fisherman ” </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">(annulus piscatoris) </span><span class="font2">bears the
                device of St Peter in a boat, drawing a net from&nbsp;the water. The first mention
                of it, as the well-under-stood personal signet ring of the pope, that has
                been&nbsp;found, occurs in a letter of Clement IV. in 1265.&nbsp;After the middle of
                the 15th century it was no longer&nbsp;used as the private seal of the popes, but
                was always attached&nbsp;to briefs. After the death of a pope the ring is broken. A
                new&nbsp;ring with the space for the name left blank is taken into the conclave, and
                placed on the finger of the newly elected pontiff, who&nbsp;thereupon declares what
                name he will assume, and gives back&nbsp;the ring to be engraved (see Waterton,
                </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Archaeologia,</span><span
                class="font2"> 40, p. 138).</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The so-called papal rings, of which many exist dating from, the 15th
                to the 17th centuries, appear to have been given&nbsp;by the popes to new-made
                cardinals. They are very&nbsp;large thumb rings, usually of gilt bronze
                coarsely&nbsp;worked, and set with a foiled piece of glass or crystal.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">On the hoop is usually engraved the name and arms of the reigning
                pope, the bezel being without a device. They are of&nbsp;little intrinsic value, but
                magnificent in appearance.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The giving of a ring to mark a betrothal was an old Roman custom. The
                ring was probably a mere pledge, </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">pignus,</span><span class="font2"> that&nbsp;the contract
                would be fulfilled. In Pliny’s time&nbsp;conservative custom still required a plain
                ring of iron,&nbsp;but the gold ring was introduced in the course of the&nbsp;2nd
                century. This use of the ring, which was thus&nbsp;of purely secular origin,
                received ecclesiastical sanction, and&nbsp;formulae of benediction of the ring exist
                from the11th century.&nbsp;The exact stages by which the wedding ring developed
                from</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">the betrothal ring can no longer be traced.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Gemel or gimmcl rings, from the Latin </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">gemellus,</span><span class="font2"> a twin, were made
                with two hoops fitted together, and could be worn&nbsp;either together or singly;
                they were common in the&nbsp;16th and 17th centuries, and were much used
            as</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">betrothal rings.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Posy rings, so called from the “ poesy ” or rhyme engraved on them,
                were specially common in the same centuries. The&nbsp;name “ posy ring ” does not
                occur earlier than the 16th&nbsp;century. A posy ring inscribed with “ Love
                me&nbsp;and leave me not ” is mentioned by Shakespeare</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Mer. of Ven.,</span><span class="font2">
                act V. sc. 1). The custom of inscribing rings 'with mottoes or words of good omen
                dates from a very early&nbsp;time. Greek and Roman rings exist with words such as
                </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;"
                >zhcaic,&nbsp;xaipe,</span><span class="font0"> KAAH, </span><span class="font2">or
                </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">votis meis Claudia
                vivas.</span><span class="font2"> In the Middle Ages&nbsp;many rings were inscribed
                with words of cabalistic power, such&nbsp;as </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">anam zapta,</span><span class="font2"> or Caspar,
                Melchior and Balthasar, the supposed&nbsp;names of the Magi. In the 17th century
                they were largely used&nbsp;as wedding rings, with such phrases as “ Love and
                obaye,”&nbsp;“ Fear God and love me,” “ No gift can show the love I owe,”&nbsp;“ God
                above increase our love ” or “ Mulier viro subjecta esto.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">In the same century memorial rings with a name and date of death were
                frequently made of very elaborate form, enamelled in black and white; a not unusual
                design was&nbsp;two skeletons bent along the hoop, and holding a</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">coffin which formed the bezel.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Cramp rings were much worn during the. Middle Ages as a preservative
                against cramp. They derived their virtue from&nbsp;being blessed by the king; a
                special form of service&nbsp;was used for this, and a large number of rings
                were&nbsp;consecrated at one time, usually when the sovereign</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">touched patients for the king’s evil.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Decade rings were not uncommon, especially in the 15th century; these
                were so called from their having ten knobs&nbsp;along the hoop of the ring, and were
                used, after the&nbsp;manner of rosaries, to say nine aves and a paternoster.&nbsp;In
                some cases there are only nine knobs, the bezel&nbsp;of the ring heing counted in,
                and taking the place of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
                >gaude</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">in a rosary. The hezel of these rings is usually engraved with a
                sacred monogram or word.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">In the 15th and 16th centuries signet rings engraved with a badge or
                trademark were much used by merchants and&nbsp;others; these were not only used to
                form seals, but&nbsp;the ring itself was often sent by a trusty bearer as&nbsp;the
                proof of the genuineness of a bill of demand.@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>At the same time
                private gentlemen used massive rings wholly&nbsp;of gold with their initials cut on
                the bezel, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span
                class="font2">graceful knot&nbsp;of flowers twining round the letters. Other fine
                gold rings of&nbsp;this period have coats of arms or crests with graceful
                lambrequins.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Poison rings with a hollow bezel were used in classical times; as,,
                for example, that by which Hannibal killed himself, and&nbsp;the poison ring of
                Demosthenes. Pliny records that,&nbsp;after Crassus had stolen the gold treasure
                from under&nbsp;the throne of Capitoline Jupiter, the guardian of the&nbsp;shrine,
                to escape torture, “ broke the gem of his ring in his&nbsp;mouth and died
                immediately.” The medieval </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
                >anello della&nbsp;morte,</span><span class="font2"> supposed to be a Venetian
                invention, was actually used&nbsp;as an easy method of murder. Among the elaborate
                ornaments&nbsp;of the bezel a hollow point made to work with a spring
                was&nbsp;concealed; it communicated with a receptacle for poison in a&nbsp;cavity
                behind, in such a way that the murderer could give&nbsp;the fatal scratch while
                shaking hands with his enemy. This&nbsp;device was probably suggested by the poison
                fang of a snake.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">A very large and elaborate form of ring is that used during the
                Jewish marriage service. Fine examples of the 16th and&nbsp;17th centuries exist. In
                the place of the bezel is a&nbsp;model, minutely worked in gold or base metal, of
                a&nbsp;building with high gabled roofs, and frequently&nbsp;movable weathercocks on
                the apex. This is </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a
                </span><span class="font2">conventional&nbsp;representation of the temple at
                Jerusalem.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Perhaps the most magnificent rings from the beauty of the workmanship
                of the hoop are those of which Benvenuto Cellini&nbsp;produced the finest examples.
                They are of gold, richly chased&nbsp;and modelled with caryatides or grotesque
                figures, and are&nbsp;decorated with coloured enamels in a very skilful and
                elaborate&nbsp;way. Very fine jewels are sometimes set in these
                magnificent&nbsp;pieces of 16th-century jewellery.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Thumb rings were commonly worn from the 14th to the 17th century.
                Falstaff boasts that in his youth he&nbsp;was slender enough to “ creep into any
                alderman’s&nbsp;thumb ring” (Shakes., </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">Hen. IV., Pt. I.,</span><span class="font2"> act ii. sc.
                4).</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The finest collections of rings formed in Britain have been those of
                Lord Londesborough, Edmxind Waterton (now in&nbsp;the Victoria and Albert Museum)
                and the collection in the&nbsp;British Museum, which was greatly augmented in 1897
                by&nbsp;the bequest of the late Sir A. W. Franks.</span></p>
