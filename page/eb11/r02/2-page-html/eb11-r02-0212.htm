The mining of iron ore was begun about 1767 in the vicinity&nbsp;of the present Cranston, and much of the metal was usèd in the&nbsp;making of cannon during the War of Independence, but thesupply&nbsp;was soon exhausted. Near Tiverton and Cranston graphite has&nbsp;been quarried.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Manufactures.—</span><span class="font2">Rhode Island is essentially a manufacturing state; of the 191,923 persons in the state Cngagedingainful&nbsp;occupations in 1900, 101,162 (or 52.7%) were employed in&nbsp;manufacturing and mechanical pursuits. By the middle of&nbsp;the 17th century boat-building had become an established&nbsp;industry, and large vessels were built at Newport. In 1777&nbsp;the state offered a large premium for every pound of steel,&nbsp;similar to German steel, made within its boundaries; and in&nbsp;1789 a rolling and slitting mill was built near Providence.&nbsp;Cotton was first imported to Providence from Spain in 1783;&nbsp;a company to carry on cotton-spinning, formed at Providence&nbsp;in 1786, established there in the following year a factory containing a spinning jenny of 28 spindles (the first machine of&nbsp;the kind to be used in the United States), and also a carding&nbsp;machine and a spinning frame with which was manufactured&nbsp;a kind of jean having a linen warp and a cotton filling. The&nbsp;fly shuttle was also apparently first introduced at Providence&nbsp;in 1788. The first calico printed in the United States was&nbsp;made at East Greenwich about 1794. The Providence Association of Mechanics and Manufacturers, incorporated in 1789,&nbsp;organized industrial development. The prohibition of the&nbsp;exportation from England of machinery, models or drawings&nbsp;retarded mechanical improvement, but in 1790 an industrial&nbsp;company was formed at Providence to carry on cotton spinning,&nbsp;and in December of that year there was established at Pawtucket a factory equipped with Arkwright machines constructed&nbsp;by Samuel Slater. This machinery was operated by waterpower, then first used in the United States for the spinning of&nbsp;cotton thread; and from this may he dated the beginning of&nbsp;the factory system in Rhode Island. These machines were soon&nbsp;adapted to the spinning of wool, and in 1804 a woollen factory&nbsp;was built at Peacedale, South Kingston. The first power-loom used in the United States was invented about 1812, and&nbsp;was set up at PeacedaIe, in 1814, for the manufacture of woollen&nbsp;Saddlegirths and other webbing. The first power-loom for&nbsp;cotton manufacture was set up in North Providence in 1817.&nbsp;Textile manufacturing by improved methods was hardly well&nbsp;established in Rhode Island before 1825. The manufacture&nbsp;of jewelry, which was established in Providence in 1784, was&nbsp;greatly promoted ten years later by Nehemiah Dodge’s invention of the process of “ gold-filling,” still further improved&nbsp;in 1846 by Thomas H. Lowe. The manufacture of silverware&nbsp;was begun in Providence soon after the close of the War of&nbsp;Independence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rhode Island’s water powers have been its only natural resources which have aided in the development of its manufactures, and its transportation facilities have always been&nbsp;inadequate, because of shallow water at Providence and scanty&nbsp;railway communication; but the state’s manufacturing enterprises are of great importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1900 Rhode Island ranked 17th among the states in the value of its manufactured products, but led all of the states in the value&nbsp;per capita ($430). The total number of establishments in 1850&nbsp;was 864; in 1890, 3377, and in 1900, 4189. In 1900 there were&nbsp;1678 factories, and in 1905, 1617 factories.@@<sup>1</sup> The total capital invested in manufacturing in 1850 was $12,935,676; in 1890,&nbsp;$126,483,401, and in 1900, $183,784,587, of which $176,301,606&nbsp;was in factories; in 1905 the capital invested in factories was&nbsp;$215,901,375.
