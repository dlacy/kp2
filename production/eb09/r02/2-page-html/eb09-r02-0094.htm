<p><span class="font0">Besides the work of Dominici already referred to (1840-46), the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Diccionario Historico</span><span class="font0"> of Cean Bermudez is a principal authority regarding Ribera and his&nbsp;works.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(W.

<p><span class="font2">RIBES. See Currant and Gooseberry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RICARDO, David (1772-1823), a celebrated political</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">economist, was born at London 19th April 1772. He was the third son of his father, a Jewish gentleman of&nbsp;Dutch birth, whose family, it is said, had formerly resided&nbsp;in Portugal. The elder Ricardo bore an honourable&nbsp;character, and was a successful member of the Stock&nbsp;Exchange. The son was placed for two years at a commercial school in Holland, and at the age of fourteen&nbsp;entered his father’s office, where he showed much aptitude&nbsp;for business. About the time when he attained his&nbsp;majority he abandoned the Hebrew faith, and conformed&nbsp;to the Anglican Church, a change which seems to have&nbsp;been connected with his marriage to Miss Wilkinson,&nbsp;which took place in 1793. In consequence of the step&nbsp;thus taken he was separated from his family and thrown&nbsp;on his own resources. His ability and uprightness were&nbsp;known, and he at once entered on such a successful career&nbsp;in the profession to which he had been brought up that at&nbsp;the age of twenty-five, we are told, he was already rich.&nbsp;He now began to occupy himself with scientific pursuits,&nbsp;and gave some attention to mathematics as well as to&nbsp;chemistry and mineralogy ; but, having met with Adam&nbsp;Smith’s great work in 1799 at Bath, whither he had gone&nbsp;for his wife’s health, he threw himself with ardour into&nbsp;the study of political economy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">His first publication (1809) was </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The High Price of Bullion a Proof of the Depreciation of Bank Notes.</span><span class="font2"> This&nbsp;tract was an expansion of a series of articles which the&nbsp;author had contributed to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Chronicle.</span><span class="font2"> It&nbsp;gave a fresh stimulus to the controversy, which had for&nbsp;some time been discontinued, respecting the resumption of&nbsp;cash payments. Ricardo argued that the premium on bullion and the unfavourable state of the exchanges could only&nbsp;be explained by the depreciation of the inconvertible paper&nbsp;money then in circulation, which had fallen 2δ per cent,&nbsp;below the value of specie in consequence of its over-issue.&nbsp;A committee to consider the whole question, commonly&nbsp;known as the Bullion Committee, was nominated by the&nbsp;House of Commons in February 1810. Amongst the&nbsp;members were Francis Horner, who was appointed chairman, Alexander Baring (afterwards Lord Ashburton),&nbsp;William Huskisson, and Henry Thornton, author of the&nbsp;well known </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Inquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper&nbsp;Credit of Great Britain</span><span class="font2"> (1802). The report, which was&nbsp;presented to parliament in June of the same year, was&nbsp;the joint production of Horner, Huskisson, and Thornton.&nbsp;It asserted the same views which Ricardo had put forward,&nbsp;and recommended the repeal of the Bank Restriction Act.&nbsp;Notwithstanding this, the House of Commons of the following year, on the motion of Mr Vansittart (afterwards&nbsp;Lord Bexley), declared in the teeth of the facts that paper&nbsp;had undergone no depreciation, and negatived Horner’s&nbsp;resolutions founded on the report of the committee.&nbsp;One of the strongest opponents of Ricardo’s opinions&nbsp;was Mr Bosanquet; he published in 1811 a pamphlet&nbsp;entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Practical Observations on the Report of the Bullion&nbsp;Committee,</span><span class="font2"> and this drew forth from Ricardo an elaborate&nbsp;reply. Both this tract and its predecessor attracted much&nbsp;attention. They propound no new economic principles,&nbsp;but are based on the doctrines of Smith. They do not&nbsp;give such a systematic and complete view of the subject&nbsp;as Huskisson’s well-known tract </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(The Question respecting&nbsp;the Depreciation of the Currency Stated and Examined,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">1810), but they are well reasoned, and, as to their main&nbsp;conclusions, convincing. It has, however, been maintained&nbsp;that there were features of the case which Ricardo did&nbsp;not sufficiently take into account, especially the demand&nbsp;for bullion created by the necessity of meeting the foreign&nbsp;payments of England, which, in consequence of the Continental system, could not be otherwise discharged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1811 he made the acquaintance of James Mill, whose introduction to him arose out of the publication of&nbsp;Mill’s tract entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Commerce Defended.</span><span class="font2"> The conversation&nbsp;of Ricardo’s new friend seems to have largely influenced&nbsp;his views ; Bentham indeed declared him to be Mill’s intellectual child ; but, whilst Mill doubtless largely affected his&nbsp;political ideas, he was, on his side, under obligations to&nbsp;Ricardo in the purely economic field ; Mill said in 1823 that&nbsp;he himself and J. R. M<sup>i</sup>Culloch were Ricardo’s disciples,&nbsp;and, he added, his only genuine ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1815, when the Corn Laws were under discussion, he published his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Essay on the Influence of a Low Price of&nbsp;Corn on the Profits of Stock.</span><span class="font2"> This was directed against a&nbsp;recent tract by Malthus entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Grounds of an Opinion&nbsp;on the Policy of Restraining the Free Importation of Foreign&nbsp;Corn.</span><span class="font2"> The reasonings of the essay are based on the&nbsp;theory of rent which has often been called by the name of&nbsp;Ricardo ; but the author distinctly states that it was not&nbsp;due to him. “In all that I have said concerning the&nbsp;origin and progress of rent I have briefly repeated, and&nbsp;endeavoured to elucidate, the principles which Malthus&nbsp;has so ably laid down on the same subject in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Inquiry&nbsp;into the Nature and Progress of Rent.”</span><span class="font2"> We now know&nbsp;that the theory had been fully stated, before the time of&nbsp;Malthus, by Anderson ; it is in any case clear that it was&nbsp;no discovery of Ricardo. Even the conception of the soils&nbsp;of a country as comparable to a series of machines of&nbsp;different original powers, though capable of improvement&nbsp;by the application of capital, is quoted from Malthus.&nbsp;Ricardo states in this essay a set of propositions, most of&nbsp;them deductions from the theory of rent, which are in&nbsp;substance the same as those afterwards embodied in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Principles,</span><span class="font2"> and regarded as characteristic of his system,&nbsp;such as that increase of wages does not raise prices ; that&nbsp;profits can be raised only by a fall in wages and diminished&nbsp;only by a rise in wages ; and that profits, in the whole&nbsp;progress of society, are determined by the cost of the production of the food which is raised at the greatest expense.&nbsp;It does not appear that, excepting the theory of foreign&nbsp;trade, anything of the nature of fundamental doctrine, as&nbsp;distinct from the special subjects of banking and taxation,&nbsp;is laid down in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Principles</span><span class="font2"> which does not already&nbsp;appear in this tract. We find in it, too, the same exclusive regard to the interest of the capitalist class, and the&nbsp;same identification of their interest with that of the&nbsp;whole nation, which are generally characteristic of his&nbsp;writings. “ Rent,” he says, “ is in all cases a portion of&nbsp;the profits previously obtained on the land,” a proposition&nbsp;by which, for the sake, it is to be feared, of creating a&nbsp;political prejudice, he obscures his own doctrine that true&nbsp;rent can never be a part of profit ; and he alleges what&nbsp;is in a sense true, but has a most invidious effect,—that&nbsp;“the interest of the landlord is always opposed to the&nbsp;interest of every other class in the community,” though&nbsp;the existence of a distinct landlord class is by no means a&nbsp;necessity, and the owner of rent, which somebody must&nbsp;own, could not, even by entirely remitting it, alter the&nbsp;price of food, or increase the profits of the capitalist,&nbsp;except by presenting him with a gift to which he has no&nbsp;economic claim. At the close of the tract he endeavours&nbsp;to show in opposition to Malthus that the danger of&nbsp;dependence on foreign supply for a large part of our food,&nbsp;and the losses on invested capital which would result from&nbsp;a legislative change, could not be so serious as to counterbalance the advantages arising from a free importation.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
