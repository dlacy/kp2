<p><span class="font2">which will rarely exceed the truth by -⅛. This serves (by the same process) for finding another, which will commonly be sufficiently exact. We shall illustrate this by an example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let there be a river whose channel is a rectangle 150 feet wide and six feet deep, and which discharges 1500&nbsp;cubic feet of water per second, having a velocity of twenty inches, and slope of y<sub>3</sub></span><span class="font0">⅙</span><span class="font2"><sub>sπ</sub>, or about ∙⅛ of an inch in&nbsp;100 fathoms. How much will it rise if it receives an addition which triples its discharge ? and what will be its velocity ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If the velocity remained the same, its depth would be tripled ; but we know by the general formula that its velocity will be greatly increased, and therefore its depth will&nbsp;not be tripled. Suppose it to be doubled, and to become&nbsp;twelve feet. This will give </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">d —</span><span class="font2"> 10∙34483, or 124∙138&nbsp;inches ; then the equation </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vd—</span><span class="font2">0∙l =-==-—, or</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">√B = 107∙8, D = 4500 × 1728 = 7776000 cubic inches, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">w—</span><span class="font2"> 1800 inches, √&lt;∙7—0∙l = 11-0417, will give A = 159∙33&nbsp;inches or 13-276 feet; whereas it should have been 12. This&nbsp;shows that our calculated value of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">d 'κta</span><span class="font2"> too small. Let us&nbsp;therefore increase the depth by 0∙9, or make it 12∙9, and repeat the calculation. This will give us √<sup>,</sup>rf— 0∙l = 11∙3927,&nbsp;and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lι</span><span class="font2"> = 12-867, instead of 13-276. Therefore, augmenting our data, 0∙9 changes our answer 0409. If we suppose these small changes to retain their proportions, we&nbsp;may conclude that if 12 be augmented by the quantity&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">x ×</span><span class="font2"> 0∙9, the quantity 13∙276 will diminish by the quantity&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">x ×</span><span class="font2"> 0-409. Therefore, that the estimated value of A may&nbsp;agree with the one which results from’the calculation, we&nbsp;must have 12 + </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">x</span><span class="font2"> × 0∙9 — 13∙276 — </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">x×</span><span class="font2"> 0∙409. This</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1∙276</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">will give </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">x = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">= 0-9748; and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">x</span><span class="font2"> × 0∙9 = 0-8773;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">and A = 12-8773. If w-e repeat the calculation with this value of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">h,</span><span class="font2"> we shall find no change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This value of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span class="font2"> gives </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font2"> = 131-8836 inches. If we now compute the new velocity by dividing the new discharge&nbsp;4500 by the new area 150 × 12-8773, we shall find it to be&nbsp;27∙95 inches, in place of 20, the former velocity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We might have made a pretty exact first assumption, by recollecting what was formerly observed, that when the&nbsp;breadth is very great in proportion to the depth, the mean&nbsp;depth differs insensibly from the real depth, or rather follows nearly the same proportions, and that the velocities&nbsp;are proportional to the square roots of the depths. Call&nbsp;the first discharge </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">d,</span><span class="font2"> the height A, and velocity </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">v,</span><span class="font2"> and let&nbsp;D, H, and V, express these things in their augmented</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">And in making these first guesses, we shall do it 1 exactly, by recollecting that a certain variation of the 1&nbsp;depth </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font2"> requires a greater variation of the height, ant&nbsp;increment will be to the height nearly as half the hi&nbsp;to the width, as may easily be seen. Therefore, if we</span></p>

W’e mention these circumstances,&nbsp;those who are disposed to apply these doctrines to the&nbsp;lution of practical cases may be at no loss when one&nbsp;curs of which the regular solution requires an intri&nbsp;analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is evident that the inverse of the foregoing probl will show the effects of enlarging the section of a r&nbsp;that is, will show how much its surface will be sunk by-proposed enlargement of its bed. It is therefore neet&nbsp;to propose such problems in this place. Common si&nbsp;directs us to make these enlargements in those parts of&nbsp;river where their effect will be greatest, that is, where&nbsp;shallowest when its breadth greatly exceeds its depth&nbsp;where it is narrowest (if its depth exceed the brea&nbsp;which is a very rare case), or, in general, where the sloj&nbsp;the smallest for a short run.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The same general principles direct us in the metho embankments for the prevention of floods, by enablinj&nbsp;to ascertain the heights necessary to be given to our ba&nbsp;This will evidently depend, not only on the additi</span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font2">&nbsp;quantity of water which experience tells us a river br&nbsp;down during its freshes, but also on the distance at wl&nbsp;we place the banks from the natural banks of the ri&nbsp;This is a point where mistaken economy frequently def&nbsp;its own purpose. If we raise our embankment at s</span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font2">&nbsp;distance from the natural banks of the river, not only&nbsp;a smaller hcight suffice, and consequently a smaller h&nbsp;which will make a saving in the duplicate proportion of&nbsp;height ; but our works will be so much the more dur&nbsp;nearly, if not exactly, in the same proportion. For by <sup>,&nbsp;</sup>enlarging the additional bed which we give to the swc&nbsp;river, we diminish its velocity almost in the same ,&nbsp;portion that we enlarge its channel, and thus diminisl&nbsp;power of ruining our works. Except, therefore, in the&nbsp;of a river whose freshes are loaded with fine sand to des&nbsp;the turf, it is always proper to place the embankment&nbsp;considerable distance from the natural banks. Placing t&nbsp;at half the breadth of the stream from its natural ba&nbsp;will nearly double its channel ; and, except in the </span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font2">&nbsp;here mentioned, the space now detached from our fi&nbsp;will afford excellent pasture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The limits of such a work as ours will not permit u enter into any detail on the method of embankment,&nbsp;would require a volume to give instructions as to the π&nbsp;ner of founding, raising, and securing the dikes wl&nbsp;must be raised, and a thousand circumstances which r&nbsp;be attended to. But a few general observations may&nbsp;made, which naturally occur while we are considering&nbsp;manner in which a river works in settling or altering&nbsp;channel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It must be remarked, in the first place, that the 1 will rise higher when embanked than it does while it&nbsp;allowed to spread ; and it is by that means easy to 1&nbsp;clude to what height it will rise from the greatest heigl&nbsp;which it has been observed to rise in its floods.
