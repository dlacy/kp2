<p><span class="font1">ROMANO (Giulio), a famous painter, was the diſciple of Raphael, who had ſuch an affection for him,&nbsp;that he appointed him, with John Francis Penni, his&nbsp;heir. His conceptions were more extraordinary and&nbsp;more elevated than even thoſe of his maſter, but not&nbsp;ſo natural. He was wonderful in the choice of attitudes ; but did not perfectly underſtand the lights and&nbsp;ſhades, and is frequently harſh and ungraceful. The&nbsp;folds of his draperies, ſays Du Freſnoy, are neither&nbsp;beautiful nor great, eaſy nor natural, but all extravagant, like the fantaſtical habits of comedians. He was,&nbsp;however, ſuperior to moſt painters, by his profound&nbsp;knowledge of antiquity ; and, by converging with the&nbsp;works of the moſt excellent poets, particularly Homer,&nbsp;he made himſelf maſter of the qualifications neceſſarily&nbsp;required in a great deſigner. Julio Romano was alſo&nbsp;well ſhilled in architecture. He was employed by cardinal de Medicis, who was afterwards pope under the&nbsp;name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Clement</span><span class="font1"> VII.; and afterwards went to Mantua,&nbsp;whither he was invited by Frederic Gonzaga, marquis&nbsp;of that city, in order to avoid his being juſtly puniſhed&nbsp;for his having drawn at Rome the deſigns of 20 ob-ſcene plates, engraved by Mark Antony, to which A-retine added the ſame number of ſonnets. Julio Romano embelliſhed the city of Mantua with many of his&nbsp;performances both in painting and architecture ; and&nbsp;died in that city in 1545, at 54 years of age, much&nbsp;regretted by the marquis, who had an extraordinary&nbsp;friendſhip ſor him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROME, a very ancient and celebrated city of Italy, ſituated on the river Tiber, in E. Long. 13<sup>0</sup>. N. Lat. 41. 4Ç. once the capital of the greateſt empire in&nbsp;the world ; and famous in modern hiſtory ſor being the&nbsp;centre of an eccleſiaſtical tyranny, by which for many&nbsp;ages the greateſt part of the world was held in ſubjec-tion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The ancient Romans derived their origin from Æ-neas the Trojan hero : and though ſome hiſtorians pretend to treat his voyage into Italy as a mere fable, yet no ſufficient reaſons for rejecting this account have been&nbsp;offered, nor has any more probable hiſtory of the origin&nbsp;of the Roman name been given ; ſo that, without entering into the diſpute, we ſhall proceed to the hiſtory&nbsp;of Æneas and his ſucceſſors as they are recorded by the&nbsp;generality of Latin writers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When the Greeks, by the treachery of the ſons of Antehor, or by whatever other means it happened,&nbsp;were become maſters of Troy, Æneas with the forces&nbsp;under his command retired into the fortreſs of the city,&nbsp;and defended it bravely for ſome time; but yielding at&nbsp;length to neceſſity, he conveyed away his gods, his father, wife, and children, with every thing he had that&nbsp;was valuable, and, followed by a numerous crowd of&nbsp;Trojans, fled to the ſtrong places of Mount Ida. Hither all thoſe of his countrymen, who were more anxious than the reſt to preſerve their liberty, flocked to&nbsp;him from the ſeveral towns of Troas. His army thus&nbsp;augmented and advantageouſly polled, he continued&nbsp;quiet, waiting for the departure of the Greeks, who,&nbsp;it was imagined, would return home as ſoon as they&nbsp;had pillaged the country. But theſe, after they had&nbsp;enriched themſelves with the ſpoils of Troy and of the&nbsp;neighbouring towns, turned their arms againſt the fugitives, </span><span class="font0">re </span><span class="font1">ſolving to attack them in their ſtrong-holds&nbsp;upon the mountain. Æneas, to avoid the lrazard of&nbsp;being forced in his laſt refuge, had recourſe to négociation ; and, by his heralds, intreated the enemy not&nbsp;to conſtrain him to a battle. Peace was granted him,&nbsp;on condition that he with his followers quitted the Trojan territories ; and. the Greeks, on their part, promiſed not to moleſt him in his retreat, but to let him&nbsp;ſafely paſs through any country within the extent of&nbsp;their domination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Upon this aſſurance Æneas equipped a fleet, in of-der to ſeek a ſettlement in ſome foreign land. We are told, that at his departure he leſt his eldeſt ſon Aſca-nius with the Daſylites, a people of Bithynia, who deſired to have him for their king ; but that the young&nbsp;prince did not remain long with them : for when Sca-mandrius (Aſtyanax), with the reſt of the Hectoridse&nbsp;whom Neoptolemus permitted to return home from&nbsp;Greece, repaired to him, he put himſelf at their head,&nbsp;and led them back to their native country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Trojan having croſſed the Helleſpont, arrived in the peninſula of Pallene, where he built a city, called from him </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ænda,</span><span class="font1"> and left in it a part of that multitude which had followed him. From thence he failed to Delos ; and thence to Cythera, where he erected&nbsp;a temple to Venus. He built another to the ſame goddeſs in Zacynthus, in which iſland he likewiſe inſtituted games, called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">races of Æneas and Penns :</span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;ſtatues of both, ſays Dionyſius, are ſtanding to this&nbsp;day. In Leucas, where the Trojans landed, was to be&nbsp;ſeen, in the ſame author’s time, a temple erected to Venus the mother of Ænea6. Nor were Actium and Am-brada without monuments that teſtified his arrival in&nbsp;thoſe places. At Dodona were found brazen vaſes,&nbsp;upon which the name of the Trojan hero, who had&nbsp;made an offering of them to Jupiter, was engraven in&nbsp;old characters. Not far from Buthrotos, in Epirus, a&nbsp;Trojan camp which had eſeaped the injuries of time,&nbsp;retained the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Troja.</span><span class="font1"> All theſe antiquities, ſtill&nbsp;ſubſiſting in the reign </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font1"> Auguſtus, were then looked&nbsp;upon as indiſputable proofs of Æneas’s voyage to Epirus: “ and that he carne into Italy (adds the ſame&nbsp;Dionyſius) we have the concurrent teſtimony of all the&nbsp;Romans ; the ceremonies they obſerve in their ſacrri&nbsp;ſices and feſtivals bear witneſs to it, as all’» the Sibylline books, the Pythian oracles, and many other things&nbsp;which nobody can reaſonably reject as invented merely&nbsp;for ornament.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The firſt land of Italy which Æneas made, after croſſing the Ionian ſea, was cape Minerva, in Iapygia;&nbsp;and here he went on ſhore. Sailing afterwards from&nbsp;hence, and coaſting along the ſouth-eaſt -of Italy and&nbsp;the eaſt and ſouth ſides of Sicily, he arrived with his&nbsp;fleet either by choice or by ſtreſs </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font1"> weather at the port&nbsp;of Drepanuτn in that iſland. Elymus and Ægeftus, who&nbsp;had eſeaped from Troy a little before him, had brought&nbsp;a Trojan colony to this place. Æneas augmented it&nbsp;by a good number of his followers, whom, pleaſed to&nbsp;have found a ſafe reſting place after many dangers and&nbsp;fatiguing voyages, he willingly left behind him at tlreir&nbsp;requeſt ; though certain authors pretend that he was&nbsp;conſtrained to it by the difficulty of tranſporting them,&nbsp;becauſe ſome Trojan women, weary of the ſea, had&nbsp;burnt a conſiderable part of his ſhips.</span></p>
