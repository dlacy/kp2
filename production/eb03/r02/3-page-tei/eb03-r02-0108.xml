The Latins purſued them, and in the purſuit Lauſus was killed : whoſe death ſo diſcouraged Mezentius, that he immediately ſued for peace ; which was granted him, upon condition, that for the future the Tiber ſhould be the boundary between the Latin and Hetrurian territories.</p><p>In the mean time Lavinia, who had been-leſt with child by Æneas, entertaining a ſtrong jealouſy of the &gt;ambition of her ſon-in-law, retired to the woods, and was there peaceably delivered of a fon, who, from his father, was named <hi rend="italic">Æneas·,</hi>  and, from the place of his •birth, had the ſurname of <hi rend="italic">Sylvius :</hi>  hut as the queen’s •flight, who had diſappeared on a ſudden, raiſed ſuſpi-cions at Lavinium prejudicial to the reputation of Aſe canius, he uſed all poſſible means to remove them, cauſed diligent ſearch to be made after Lavinia, calmed her fears, and prevailed upon her to return to trie town with her ſon, whom he ever after treated as a brother. Lavinium grew every day more populous ; but as it •was in reality the patrimony of Lavinia, and the inheritance of her ſon Sylvius, Aſcanius reſolved to refιgn it to them, and build elſewhere another city for himſelf. This he ∙made.the place of his reſidence, and the capital of his new kingdom, calling it <hi rend="italic">Alba Longa ; Alba,</hi>  from a white ſow, which we are told Æneas .had found in the place where it was built ; and <hi rend="italic">Longa, </hi>to diſtinguiſh it from another town of the ſame name in the country of the Marſi ; or rather, becauſe it ex-<hi rend="sub">l</hi>  tended, without having much breadth, the whole length . of a lake near which it was built. It was 30 years after the building of Lavinium that Aſcauius fixed his : abode at Alba ; and there he died, after a reign of -.about 38 years, 12 of which he had reſided at his new ſettlement. He left a ſon called<hi rend="italic">lulus ;</hi>  ſo that between him and Sylvius lay the right of ſucceſſion to the Latin throne; the latter being the ſon, and the former the grandſon, of Æneas.</p><p>Ί he Latins not thinking it their intereſt to continue divided, as it were, into two ſtates, reſolved to unite Alba and Lavinium into one ſovereignty ; and as Sylvius was born of Lavinia the daughter of Latinus, and •had thereby an undoubted title to the kingdom of his grandfather, whereas the other was but the ſon of a ſtranger, the Latins beſtowed the crown on Sylvius ; and, to make lulus ſome amends, decreed to him the ſovereign power in affairs of religion j a power which thenceforth continued in his family. Sylvius was ſucceeded by 13 kings of the ſame race, who for near 400 years reigned at Alba ; but we ſcarce know any thing of them beſides their names, and the years of their re-ſpective reigns. Æneas Sylvius died, after a reign of 29 yeaιs. His ſon, called alſo <hi rend="italic">Æneas Sylvius,</hi>  governed Latium 31 years. <hi rend="italic">Latinus Sylvius,</hi>  who ſucceeded him, ſwayed the ſceptre for the ſpace of 5 t years — Alba reigned 39 ; Capetus, by Livy named <hi rend="italic">Atys, 26; </hi>Gapis, 28 ; and Capetus, 13. Tſherinus, who ſucceeded him, engaged in a war which proved fatal to him ; for in a battle which was ſought on the banks of the Albula, he was forced into that river and drowned. From him the river took the name of <hi rend="italic">Tiber,</hi>  which it has borne ever ſince. Agrippa ſucceeded Tiberimιs after a reign of eight years ; and left the throne, which</p><lb/><p>he had held 4 r years, to Alladius ; who retgned 19, and was ſucceeded by Aventinus, who leſt his name to the bill Aventinus, where he was interred. Procas, who ſucceeded him, and reigned 23 years, wa9 the father of Numitor and Amulius ; and at his death bequeathed the throne to his elder ſon Numitor. But Amulius, who ſurpaſſed his brother in courage and underſtanding, drove him from the throne ; and to ſecure it to himſelf, murdered Ægeftus, Numitor’s only ſon, and conſecrated his daughter Rhea Sylvia to the worſhip of Veſta, by which ſhe was obliged to perpetual virginity. But this precaution proved ineffectual ; for as the Veſ-tal was going to a neighbouring ſpring to fetch water for the performance of a ſacriſice to Mars, ſhe was met and raviſhed by a man in a military habit, like that iu which the god Mars is repreſented. Some authors think that this counterfeit Mars was a lover come thither by her appointment ; others charge Amulius him-ſelſ with uſing this violence to his niece, not ſo much to gratify his luit, as to have a pretence to deſtroy her.— For ever after he cauſed her to be carefully watched, till ſhe was delivered of two ſons ; and then exaggerating her crime in an aſſembly of the people, he prevailed upon them to fentenςe her to death, and to condemn the fruit of her criminal amour to be thrown into the Tiber. The ſentence againſt Rhea was, according to ſome authors, changed by Amulius, at the requeſt of his daughter Antho, into perpetual confinement, but executed againſt the twins ; who being laid in a wooden trough, and carried to the foot of mount Palatine, were there turned adrift on the Tiber, which at that time overflowed its banks. But the wind and ſtream proved both ſo favourable, that at the fall of the water the two infants were left ſafe on the ſtrand, and were there happily found by Fauſtulus, the chief of the king’s ſhepherds, and ſuckled by his wife Acca Laurentia, who for her diſorderly life was called <hi rend="italic">Lupa ;</hi>  and this probably gave rife to the fabulous miracle of their being nurſed by a wolf.</p><p>As Fauſtulus was probably well acquainted with the birth of the twins, he took more than ordinary care of their education, and ſent them to Gabii to be inſtructed there in Greek literature. As they grew up, they appeared to have ſomething great in their mien and air which commanded reſpect ; and the aſcendant which they aſſumed over the other ſhepherds made them dreaded in the ſoreſts, where they exerciſed a ſort of empire. A quarrel happening between the herdſmen of Amulius and thoſe of Numitor, the two brothers took the part of the former againſt the latter ; and ſome blood being ſhed in the fray, the adverſe party, to be revenged on <hi rend="italic">Romulus</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Remus</hi>  (for ſo the twins were called), on the feſtival of Lupercalia, ſurpriſed Remus, and carried him before Numitor, to be puniſhed according to his deſerts. But Numitor feeling himſelf touched in the priſoner’s favour, aſked him where he was born, and who were his parents. His anſwer immediately ſtruck Numitor with a lively remembrance of his two grand-ſons ; their age, which was about 1 8 years, agreed with the time when the two infants were expoſed upon the Tiber ; and there needed no more to change his anger into tenderneſs.</p><p>In the mean time Romulus, eager to reſcue his brother, and purſue thoſe who had carried him off, was preparing to be revenged on them ; but Fauſtulus diſ-</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
