an ancient and conſiderable town of Africa in the kingdom of Fez, with a harbour and ſeveral ports. The harbour of Sallee is one of the beſt in the country; and yet, on account of a bar that lies acroſs it, ſhips of the ſmalleſt draught are forced to unload and take out their guns before they can get into it. There are docks to build ſhips; but they are hardly ever uſed, for want of ſkill and materials. It is a large place, divided into the Old and New. Towns, by the river Guero. It has long been famous for its rovers or pirates, which make prizes of all Chriſtian ſhips that come in their way, except there is a treaty to the contrary. The town of Sallee in its preſent ſtate, though large, preſents nothing worthy the obſervation of the</p><p>traveller except a oattery of 24 pieces of cannon fronting the ſea, and a redoubt at the entrance of the river, which is about a quarter of a mile broad, and penetrates ſeveral miles into the interior country.
