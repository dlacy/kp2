To this end, four&nbsp;battalions were detached to attack the village of Fran-quenies, and twelve battalions to attack the village of&nbsp;Ramillies, which were to be ſupported by the whole in-fantry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Gur artillery began to cannonade the enemy at one ; at about two, the attack began with the poſt of Fran-quenies, where our infantry had the good fortune to&nbsp;drive the enemy from the hedges, where they were ad-vantageouſly poſted, and at the ſame time all the caval-ry of our left wing advanced to attack that of the enemy’s right ; ſoon aſter aſl was in action. whilſt the&nbsp;cavalry were engaged, the village of Ramillies was likewiſe attacked, and forced after a vigorous reſiſtance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The battle laſted about two hours, and was pretty obſtinate; butfo ſoon as our cavalry had gained ground&nbsp;enough to attack the enemy in flank, they began to&nbsp;give way ; at the ſame time all their infantry were put&nbsp;in diforder, ſo that the whole retreated in great cofiſu-ſion. The cavalry of their leſt wing formed a little&nbsp;upon the high ground, between </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">oſſuz </span><span class="font5">and Mount St&nbsp;Andrew, to favour their retreat : but after the infantry&nbsp;and cavalry of our right wing had filed off between the&nbsp;bottom of the village of Ramillies and oſſuz, the whole&nbsp;army marched in feveral columns to attack the enemy&nbsp;anew ; but they gave way before we could come up&nbsp;with them, and retired in great confuſion, ſome towards&nbsp;the defile of the Abbey De La Ramée and towards&nbsp;Dongelberge, others towards Judogne, and others again&nbsp;towards Hougarde. They were purſued aſl night ſo&nbsp;cloſely that they were obliged to abandon all their artillery and baggage, part of which was found at Judog-ne and at Hougarde, with their cheſts of ammunition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The enemy loſt above 30,000 men, 60 cannon, 8 mortars, ſtandards, colours, baggage, &amp;c. ; we about&nbsp;3000. The reſt of the campaign was ſpent in the ſie-ges of oſtend, Menin, and Aeth. In fourteen days&nbsp;the Duke defeated and diſperſed the beſt appointed ar~&nbsp;my the Fçench ever had, and recovered all Spaniſh Brabant, the marquifate of the holy Roman empire. The&nbsp;army of the enemy conſiſted of 76 battalions and 142&nbsp;ſquadrons, including the king’s houſhold troops </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(La&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Maifon du Roi);</span><span class="font5"> and the army of the allies was 74 bat-talions and 123 ſquadrons. Conſidering the import-ance of the victory, the loſs of the allies was very ſmaſl,&nbsp;not above 1100 being killed, and 2600 wounded.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">RAMSAY (Allan), the Scots paſtoral poet, was a barber in Edinburgh in the early part of the preſent&nbsp;century. His taſte in poetry, however, has juſtly raiſed him to a degree of fame that may in ſomc meafure&nbsp;be conſidered as a recompenſe for the frowns of fortune. His ſongs are in univerſal eſteem ; as is alſo&nbsp;the only dramatic performance attributed to him, viz.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Patte and R-)ger,</span><span class="font5"> or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Gentle Shepherd,</span><span class="font5"> a Scots pa-ſtoral. He died in 1743 ; and was father to the ingenious Mr Ramſay, a celebrated painter of the preſent&nbsp;age, and who has likewiſe diſtinguiſhed himſelf by ſomc&nbsp;well-written tracts ©n various branches of polite literature, particularly the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Invelligator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ramsay (Andrew Michael), generally known bv the name of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Chevalier Ramſay,</span><span class="font5"> was a polite Scots&nbsp;writer, born of a good family at Ayr in 1686. His&nbsp;good parts and learning recommended him to be tutor&nbsp;t® the ſon of the earl of wemyſs ; after which, concei-.&nbsp;ving a diſguſt at the religion in which he had been edu-cated, he in the ſame ill humour reviewed other Chriſtian churches ; and, finding none to his liking, reſted&nbsp;for a while in Deifm. while he was in this uncertain&nbsp;ſtate of mind, he went to Leyden ; where, falling into&nbsp;the company of one Poiret a royſtic divine, he received&nbsp;the infection of myſticifm : which prompted him to con-ſult M. Fenelon, the celebrated archbiſhop of Cambrav,&nbsp;who had imbibed principles of the ſame nature ; and&nbsp;who gained him over to the Catholic religion in 1709.&nbsp;The ſubſequent courſe of his life received its direction&nbsp;from his friendſhip and connections with this prelate ;&nbsp;and being appointed, governor to the duke de Chateau&nbsp;Thierry, and the prince de Turenne, he was madc a&nbsp;knight of the order of St Lazarus, He was ſent for&nbsp;to Rome by the chevalier de St George, to undertake&nbsp;the education of his children ; but he found ſo many&nbsp;intrigues and diſſenſions on his arrival there in 1724,&nbsp;that he obtained the Chevalier’s leave to return to Pa-ris. He died in 1743, <sup>1</sup>'<sup>n</sup> the °fſi<sup>ce θ</sup>f intendant to the&nbsp;duke of Bouillon, prince de Turenne. The .moſt ca-pital work of his writing is the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Travels of Cyrus,</span><span class="font5"> which&nbsp;has been ſeveral times printed in Engliſh.</span></p>

Hi⅜-parents were of characters the moſt reſpectable, but in&nbsp;circumſtances by no means affluent. From his earlieſt&nbsp;years he difcovered a ſerious diſpoſition, and a ſtrong&nbsp;thirſt for knowledge ; and aſter paſſing through the&nbsp;courſe of a Scotch grammar ſchool education, he was&nbsp;inclined to purſue the ſtudies requiſite to ſit him for the&nbsp;profeffion of a clergyman ; an inclination with which&nbsp;the wiſhes of his mother, a woman of eminent piety,&nbsp;powerfully concurred.
