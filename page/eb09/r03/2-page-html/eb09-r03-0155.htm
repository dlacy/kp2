        <p><span class="font1">The only important church in Rome which is wholly Gotliic in style is
                S. Maria sopra Minerva, the chief church of the Dominican&nbsp;order. This was not
                the work of a Roman architect, but was designed by two Dominican friars from
                Florence—Fra Ristoro and&nbsp;Fra Sisto-about 1289, who were also the architects of
                their own&nbsp;church of S. Maria Novella. It much resembles the
                contemporary&nbsp;churches of the same order in Florence, having wide-spanned
                pointed&nbsp;arches on clustered piers and simple quadripartite vaulting.
                Its&nbsp;details resemble the early French in character.@@<sup>1</sup> It contains
                a&nbsp;large number of fine tombs ; among them that of Durandus, bishop&nbsp;of
                Mende (the author of the celebrated </span><span class="font1"

                class="font1"> by Giovanni Cosmas, c. 1300, and the tomb of Fra Angelico,&nbsp;the
                great Dominican painter, who died in Rome, 1455. The most&nbsp;elaborate specimen of
                ecclesiastical Gothic in Rome is that part of&nbsp;S. Maria in Ara Cceli which was
                rebuilt about 1300, probably by&nbsp;one of the Cosmati, namely, the south aisle and
                transept. For at&nbsp;least two centuries after the death of Giovanni Cosmas no
                native&nbsp;Roman appears to have excelled in any branch of the fine arts.
                The&nbsp;sculptured effigy and reredos of Cardinal Alençon in S. Maria
                in&nbsp;Trastevere, executed about 1400 by a certain Paulus Romanns, is a&nbsp;fair
                example of the decadence which took place during this period ;&nbsp;the effigy is a
                very clumsy and feeble copy of the fine recumbent&nbsp;figures of the
                Cosmati.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">3. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Florentine
                Period, c. 1450-1550.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The long period of almost complete artistic inactivity in Rome was
                broken iu the 15th century by the introduction of a number&nbsp;of foreign artists,
                chiefly Florentines, who during this and the&nbsp;succeeding century enriched Rome
                with an immense number of&nbsp;magnificent works of art. The dawn of this brilliant
                epoch may&nbsp;be said to have begun with the arrival of Fra Angelico (see
                Fiesole)&nbsp;in 1447, invited by Nicholas V. to paint the Avails of his
                small&nbsp;private chapel in the Vatican dedicated to S. Lorenzo.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">To Mino da Fiesole (see Mino nι Giovanni, vol. xvi. p. 477), who
                spentseveral years in Rome between 1470 and 1484, and other&nbsp;Florentine
                sculptors are due almost all the very beautiful sculptured&nbsp;tombs which λvere
                made for a large number of the Roman churches&nbsp;during the last thirty years of
                the 15th century, as well as many&nbsp;altar frontals, reredoses, tabernacles, and
                the like. Though varied&nbsp;in details, most of these tombs are designed after one
                type, that&nbsp;employed by Mino in his fine monuments in the Badia at
                Florence.&nbsp;A life-sized recumbent effigy lies on a richly ornamented
                sarcophagus,&nbsp;over which is an arched canopy decorated with reliefs ; the
                piers&nbsp;which support this (usually) have statuettes in two or more
                tiers.&nbsp;Forgrace and refined beauty no type of sepulchral monument has&nbsp;ever
                equalled this Florentine design. The peaceful attitude and&nbsp;calm face of the
                effigy are frequently of the most perfect beauty,&nbsp;and the minute statuettes and
                reliefs are finished with ivory-like&nbsp;delicacy. Though the influence of Mino,
                very strongly marked,&nbsp;may be traced in all these numerous works (there are in
                Rome more&nbsp;than a hundred tombs of this class), yet a very small
                proportion&nbsp;can be actually by his hand. Mino created and trained a
                large&nbsp;school of sculptor-pupils in Rome, some of whom appear almost
                to&nbsp;have equalled their master in skill ; and it is to them that most
                of&nbsp;these works must be referred. A very long list of churches containing
                sculpture of this class might be given ; perhaps the richest are&nbsp;S. Maria in
                Monserrato (the cloisters) and S. Maria del Popolo.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The architecture no less than the sculpture of the latter part of the
                15th century was mainly the work of Florentines, especially of&nbsp;Baccio Pintelli,
                who partly rebuilt S. Maria del Popolo, S. Agostino,@@<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>and S.
                Cosimato in Trastevere. He also was the architect of S.&nbsp;Pietro in Montorio,
                erected in 1500 for Ferdinand and Isabella of&nbsp;Spain, and probably designed the
                Sistine chapel for Sixtus IV. in&nbsp;1473. Other buildings were carried out by
                another Florentine,&nbsp;Giuliano da Majano (see Ferrerio, </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Palazzi di Ronιa,</span><span class="font1"
                > 1825). The&nbsp;Palazzo di Venezia, begun for Cardinal Barbo, afterwards Paul
                IL,&nbsp;about 1455, a very massive and stately building of mediæval character, was
                designed by Francesco di Borgo San Sepolcro.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">During the latter part of the 15th and the first few years of the
                succeeding century Rome was enriched with a number of buildings&nbsp;by Bramante

                class="font1"> ), one of the greatest architects the world has&nbsp;ever seen. With
                the most consummate skill, he combined the&nbsp;delicacy of detail and the graceful
                lightness of the Gothic style&nbsp;with the measured stateliness and rhythmical
                proportions of classic&nbsp;architecture. Though lie invariably used the round arch
                and took&nbsp;his mouldings from antique sources, his beautiful cloisters
                and&nbsp;Ioggie are Gothic in their general conception. Moreover, he
                never&nbsp;committed the prevalent blunder of the 16th century, which was&nbsp;a
                fruitless attempt to obtain magnificence by mere size in a building, without
                multiplying its parts. His principal works in Rome&nbsp;are the magnificent Palazzo
                della Cancelleria, built for Cardinal</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Riario in 1495, with its stately church of S. Lorenzo in Damaso ; the
                so-called Palazzo di Bramante in the Governo Vecchio, built in&nbsp;1500 ; and the
                Palazzo Giraud, near St Γeter<sup>,</sup>s, once the residence&nbsp;of Cardinal
                Wolsey, built in 1506. He also built the cortile of S.&nbsp;Damaso in the Vatican,
                the toy-like tempietto in the cloister of S.&nbsp;Pietro in Montorio, and'the
                cloisters of S. Maria della Pace, 1504.@@<sup>4&nbsp;</sup>In 1503 Bramante was
                appointed architect to St Peter’s, and made&nbsp;complete designs for it, with a
                plan in the form of a Greek cross.&nbsp;The piers and arches of the central dome
                were the only parts completed at the time of his death in 1514, and subsequent
                architects&nbsp;did not carry out his design. For St Peter’s, see

                the most talented architects of the first part of the 16th century ; the Villa
                Farnesina&nbsp;and the Palazzo Vidoni (usually attributed to Raphael) are
                from&nbsp;his designs.@@<sup>5</sup> His later works bear traces of that decadence
                in taste&nbsp;which so soon began, owing mainly to the rapidly growing love&nbsp;for
                the dull magnificence of the pseudo-classic style. This falling&nbsp;oft' in
                architectural taste was due to Michelangelo (g<sup>,</sup>.τ.) more&nbsp;than to any
                other one man. His cortile of the Farnese palace,&nbsp;though a work of much stately
                beauty, was one of the first stages&nbsp;towards that lifeless scholasticism and
                blind following of antique&nbsp;forms which were the destruction of architecture as
                a real living&nbsp;art, and in the succeeding century produced so much that is
                almost&nbsp;brutal in its coarseness and neglect of all true canons of
                proportion&nbsp;and scale. During the earlier stage, however, of this
                decadence&nbsp;and throughout the 16th century a large number of </span><span
                class="font0">fine </span><span class="font1">palaces&nbsp;and churches were built
                in and near Rome by various able artists,&nbsp;such as the Villa Madama by Raphael,
                part of the Palazzo Farnese&nbsp;by Antonio da Sangallo the younger, S. Giovanni de’
                Fiorentini by&nbsp;Jac. Sansovino, and many others.@@<sup>6</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">4. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Modern
                Period.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Under Vignola (1507-1573), Carlo Maderna (1556-1639), Bernini
                (1598-1680), Carlo Fontana (1634-1714), and others architectural&nbsp;beauty in Rome
                steadily declined, till the prevalent style became&nbsp;a mere caricature of
                classical forms, twisted and contorted into&nbsp;every possible incongruous and
                ridiculous shape, void of all sense&nbsp;of harmony of proportion and unredeemed by
                any grace or even&nbsp;decency of detail. Clumsy weightiness and extravagance of
                outline, with the frequent introduction of the most ungraceful curves,&nbsp;are the
                main characteristics of this unhappy period, which, unfortunately, was one of great
                activity in building. The degraded&nbsp;taste of the 17th and 18th centuries could
                see no beauty in the&nbsp;stately simplicity of the early basilicas, in the delicate
                grace and&nbsp;rich ornament of the Cosmati period, or even in the refined
                harmonious beauty of the Renaissance.@@<sup>7</sup> Every church in Rome
                is&nbsp;more or less disfigured inside with extravagant stucco pilasters
                and&nbsp;reliefs, transfiguring the whole interior, while outside many
                have&nbsp;clumsy façades stuck on without the slightest reference to
                the&nbsp;structures they are meant to decorate. The Lateran basilica is one&nbsp;of
                the most conspicuous instances of this sad treatment of a grand&nbsp;old building ;
                and the hideous façades which disfigure the fine&nbsp;churches of S. Marcello and S.
                Maria in Via Lata (both in the&nbsp;Corso) are typical examples of the degradation
                into which architecture had sunk in its latest stages. In the present century
                taste&nbsp;has somewhat improved. Since 1870, when Rome became the&nbsp;capital, an
                immense amount of building has been carried out,&nbsp;mostly innocent in design,
                though dull and lifeless. The modern&nbsp;architects of Rome possess the rare
                merit'of acknowledging their&nbsp;own artistic incapacity, and the more important
                recent buildings&nbsp;have been copies, fairly faithful in design though not in
                material,&nbsp;of fine palaces of the best 15th and 16th century architects.
                The&nbsp;Cassa di Risparmio in the Corso and some large houses in the
                new&nbsp;quarter across the Tiber are good copies of the Strozzi and
                other&nbsp;Florentine palaces ; the Hotel Bristol is from a fine palace
                at&nbsp;Venice ; and Bramante’s Palazzo Giraud has been imitated in a new&nbsp;house
                near the Piazza Nicosia. Unfortunately stucco is mainly&nbsp;used for the exteriors
                of these otherwise handsome buildings, a&nbsp;material which, however, lasts fairly
                well in the mild climate of&nbsp;Rome. The growing rage for the Parisian style of
                building, with&nbsp;wide straight boulevards, is rapidly destroying all the
                picturesqueness of the city ; and these broad streets, from their want of
                shade,&nbsp;are not suited to an almost constantly sunny climate.</span></p>
