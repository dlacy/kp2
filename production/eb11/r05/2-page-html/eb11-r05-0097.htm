<p><span class="font0">RUMINANTIA, a term employed by Cuvier to include all the existing artiodactyle ruminating ungulate mammals now&nbsp;classed under the groups Pecora, Tylopoda and Tragulina. By&nbsp;Professor Max Weber it is employed as a collective designation&nbsp;for these groups, together with the extinct Anthracotheroidea&nbsp;and Dichdbunoidea; but its use seems best restricted to a&nbsp;general term rather than a definite systematic group. (See&nbsp;Artiodactyla, Pecora, Tylopoda.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUMKER, CARL LUDWIG CHRISTIAN (1788-1862), German astronomer, was bom in Mecklenburg on the 28th of May 1788.&nbsp;He served in the British navy from 1807 until 1817, and was&nbsp;director of the school of navigation at Hamburg from 1819&nbsp;till 1820. In 1821 he went to New South Wales as astronomer&nbsp;at the observatory built at Parramatta by Sir Thomas Brisbane.&nbsp;He returned to Europe in 1830 and took charge of the observatory at Hamburg. His chief work was concerned with&nbsp;, the cataloguing of stars: a preliminary catalogue of the stars&nbsp;of the S. hemisphere was published in 1832 at Hamburg, and&nbsp;in 1846-52 he published his great catalogue of 12,000 stars.&nbsp;In 1857 he went to reside at Lisbon, where he died on the 21st</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of December 1862.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His son, George Friedrich Wilhelm (1832-1900), born on the 31st of December 1832, at Hamburg, was astronomer at&nbsp;the observatory at Durham, England, from 1853 to 1856.&nbsp;He then became assistant at the Hamburg observatory, and&nbsp;in 1862 was appointed director of the same institution. From&nbsp;1884 he was the Hamburg delegate for the International&nbsp;Earth Measurement. He died on the 3rd of March 1900.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUNCIMAN, ALEXANDER (1736-1785), Scottish historical painter, was born in Edinburgh in 1736. He studied at&nbsp;Foulis’s Academy, Glasgow, and at the age of thirty proceeded&nbsp;to Rome, where he spent five years. It was at this time that&nbsp;he became acquainted with Fuseli. The painter’s earliest&nbsp;efforts had been in landscape; he soon, however, turned to&nbsp;historical and imaginative subjects, exhibiting his “ Nausicaa&nbsp;at Play with her Maidens” in 1767 at the Free Society of British&nbsp;Artists, Edinburgh. On his return from Italy, after a brief&nbsp;residence in London, where in 1772 he exhibited in the Royal&nbsp;Academy, he settled in Edinburgh, and was appointed master&nbsp;of the Trustees’ Academy. He was patronized by Sir James*&nbsp;Clerk, whose hall at Penicuik House he decorated with a series&nbsp;of subjects from Ossian. He also executed various religious&nbsp;paintings and an altar-piece in the Cowgate Episcopal Church,&nbsp;Edinburgh, and easel pictures of “ Cymon and Iphigenia,” “ Sigis-munda weeping over the Heart of Tancred,” and “ Agrippina&nbsp;landing with the Ashes of Germanicus.” He died in Edinburgh&nbsp;on the 4th of October 1785. His works, while they show high&nbsp;intention and considerable imagination, are frequently defective&nbsp;in form and extravagant in gesture. His younger brother,&nbsp;John Runciman (1744-1766), who accompanied him to Rome,&nbsp;and died at Naples in 1766, was an artist of great promise.&nbsp;His “ Flight into Egypt,” in the National Gallery of Scotland,&nbsp;is remarkable for the precision of its execution and the mellow&nbsp;richness of its colouring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUNCORN, a market town and river-port in the Northwich parliamentary division of Cheshire, England, on the S. of the&nbsp;estuary of the Mersey 16 m. above Liverpool. Pop. of urban&nbsp;district (1901) 16,491. It is served by the London &amp; North-Western railway, and has extensive communications by canal.&nbsp;The modem prosperity of the town dates from the completion&nbsp;in 1773 of the Bridgewater Canal, which here descends into&nbsp;the Mersey by a flight of locks. Runcorn is a sub-port of&nbsp;Manchester, with which it is connected by the Manchester&nbsp;Ship Canal, and has extensive wharfage and warehouse accommodation. The chief exports are coal, salt and pitch; but&nbsp;there is also a large traffic in potters’ materials. A-transporter bridge between Runcorn and Widnes, with a suspended&nbsp;car worked by electricity to convey passengers and vehicles&nbsp;(the first bridge of the kind in England) was constructed in&nbsp;1902. The town possesses shipbuilding yards, iron foundries,&nbsp;rope works, tanneries, and soap and alkali works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Owing to the Mersey being here fordable at low water, Runcorn was in early times of considerable military importance.&nbsp;On a rock which formerly jutted into the Mersey ¿Ethelfleda&nbsp;erected a castle in 916, but of the building there are now no&nbsp;remains; while the rock was removed to further the cutting&nbsp;of the ship canal. /Ethelfleda is also said to have founded&nbsp;a town, but it is not noticed in Domesday. The ferry is&nbsp;noticed in a charter in the 12th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUNDALE (apparently from “to run” and “dale,” valley, originally something separated off, cf. “ deal”), the name of a&nbsp;form of occupation of land, somewhat resembling the English&nbsp;“ common field ” system. The land is divided into discontinuous plots, and cultivated and occupied by a number of&nbsp;tenants to whom it is leased jointly. The system was common&nbsp;in Ireland, especially in the western counties. In Scotland,&nbsp;where the system also existed, it was termed “ run-rig ” (from&nbsp;“ run,” and “ rig ” or “ ridge ”).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUNEBERG, JOHAN LUDVIG (1804-1877), Swedish poet, son of a sea-captain, was bom at Jakobstad, in Finland, on the&nbsp;5th of February 1804. He was brought up by an uncle at&nbsp;Ule&amp;borg, and entered the university of Abo in the autumn&nbsp;term of 1822. In 1823 he broke off his studies to act as tutor&nbsp;in two quiet Finnish villages, Saarijarvi and Ruovesi, where he&nbsp;gained a thorough knowledge of the popular life and poetry,&nbsp;and on his return to Abo he began to contribute verses to the&nbsp;local newspapers. In the spring of 1827 he received the degree&nbsp;of doctor of philosophy. The university had been removed&nbsp;after the great fire of 1827 to Helsingfors, where Runeberg&nbsp;became, in 1830, amanuensis to the council of the university.&nbsp;In the same year he published at Helsingfors his first volume&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dikler</span><span class="font0"> (Poems), and a collection of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Serbiska folks&amp;nger</span><span class="font0"> (Servian&nbsp;folksongs) translated into Swedish. In 1831 his verse romance&nbsp;of Finnish life, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Grafven i Perrho</span><span class="font0"> (The Grave in Perrho), received&nbsp;the small gold medal of the Swedish Academy, and the poet&nbsp;married Fredrika Chariotta Tengstrom, daughter of the archbishop of Finland. In the same year he was appointed&nbsp;university lecturer on Roman literature. In 1832 he published&nbsp;his beautiful little idyll, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Elgskyttarne</span><span class="font0"> (The Elk-Hunters); and&nbsp;in 1833 a second collection of lyrical poems. He founded in&nbsp;1832 the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Helsingfors Morgonblad,</span><span class="font0"> a paper which dealt chiefly&nbsp;with aesthetic and literary questions, and exercised great&nbsp;influence both in Sweden and Finland. In it appeared many of&nbsp;his own poems and tales. His comedy, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Friaren frdn Landel</span><span class="font0"> (The&nbsp;Country Lover, 1834), was not a success, but in 1836 he pubb'shed&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hanna,</span><span class="font0"> a charming idyll of Finnish country life, written in&nbsp;hexameters. In 1837 Runeberg accepted the chair of Latin&nbsp;at Borgi College, and resided in that little town for the rest of&nbsp;his life..</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He was now recognized in his remote Finland retirement as second only to Tegner among the poets of Sweden. In 1841&nbsp;he published </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nadesckda,</span><span class="font0"> a romance of modem Russian life,&nbsp;and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Julqvatten</span><span class="font0"> (Christmas Eve), another idyll of Finnish life.&nbsp;The third volume of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dikler</span><span class="font0"> bears the date 1843, and the&nbsp;noble cycle of unrhymed verse romances called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kung Fjalar,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the setting of which is taken from old Scandinavian legend,&nbsp;was published in 1844. Finally, in 1848, he achieved a great&nbsp;popular success by his splendid series of poems on the war of&nbsp;independence in 1808, when Swedes and Finns fought side by&nbsp;side. The series bears the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fdnrik St&amp;ls Stigner</span><span class="font0"> (Ensign&nbsp;Steel’s Stories); a second series appeared in i860. From&nbsp;1847 to 1850 the poet was rector of Borg&amp; College, a post which&nbsp;he resigned to take the only journey out of Finland which he&nbsp;ever accompbshed, a visit to Sweden in 1851. In 1854 he&nbsp;collected his prose essays into a volume entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Stndrre&nbsp;BerSttelser.</span><span class="font0"> In the same year he was made president of a&nbsp;committee for the preparation of a national Psalter, which</span></p>
