among miners, denotes a train of metalline ſtones, ſerving to direct them in the diſcovery of mines.</p><p><hi rend="italic">SHOAD-Stones,</hi> a term uſed by the miners of Cornwall and other parts of this kingdom, to expreſs ſuch looſe maſſes of ſtone as are uſually found about the entrances into mines, ſometimes running in a ſtraight course from the load or vein of ore to the ſurface of the earth.</p><p>Theſe are ſtones of the common kinds, appearing to have been pieces broken from the ſtrata or larger maſſes; but they uſually contain mundic, or marcaſitic matter, and more or leſs of the ore to be found in the mine, They appear to have been at ſome time rolled about in water, their corners being broken off, and their ſurface ſmoothed and rounded.</p><p>The antimony mines in Cornwall are always eaſily diſcovered by the ſhoad-ſtones, theſe uſually lying up to</p><p>the surface, or very nearly ſo ; and the matter of the ſtone being a white ſpar, or debated cryſtal, in which the native colour of the ore, which is a ſhining bluiſh black, eaſily diſcovers itſelf in ſtreaks and threads.</p><p>Shoad-ſtones are of ſo many kinds, and of ſuch various appearances, that it is not eaſy to deſcribe or know them : but the miners, to whom they are of greateſt uſe in the tracing or ſearching after new mines, distinguiſh them from other ſtones by their weight ; for if very ponderous, though they look ever ſo much like common ſtones, there is great reaſon to ſuſpect that they contain ſome metal. Another mark ot them is their being ſpongy and porous; this is a ſign of eſpecial uſe in the tin countries ; for the tin ſhoad-ſtones are often ſo porous and ſpongy, that they reſemble large bodies thoroughly calcined. There are many- other appearances or tin ſhoads, the very hardeſt and ſirmeſt ſtones often containing this metal.</p><p>When the miners, in tracing a ſhoad up bill, meet with ſuch odd ſtones and earths that they know not well what to make of them, they have recourſe to vanning, that is, they calcine and powder the ſtone, clay, or whatever elſe is suppoſed to contain the metal ; and then waſhing it in an inſtrument, prepared for that purpose, and called a <hi rend="italic">vanning ſhovel,</hi> they find the earthy matter waſhed away, and of the remainder, the ſtony or gravelly matter lies behind, and the metalline matter at the point of the ſhovel. If the perſon who performs this operation has any judgment, he eaſily diſcovers not only what the metal is that is contained in the ſhoad, but alſo will make a very probable gueſs at what quantity the mine is likely to yield of it in proportion to the ore.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
