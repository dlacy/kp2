<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">which finally superseded the native law in James I.’s reign, as modified by subsequent legislation. The main difference is in the&nbsp;law of </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Landlord and Tenant </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and the operation of the&nbsp;Landed Estates Court, merged in the High Court of Justice in Ireland by the Supreme Court of Judicature (Ireland) Act, 1877.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">United States.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—The law of real estate in the United States is the law of England modified to suit a different state of circumstances.&nbsp;The main point of difference is that in the United States the&nbsp;occupiers of land are generally wholly or in part owners, not tenants,&nbsp;as iu England. This is to a great extent the effect of the homestead laws (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Homestead). </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The traces of the feudal origin of&nbsp;the law are, as might be expected, considerably less prominent than&nbsp;in England. Thus estates tail are practically obsolete ; in some&nbsp;States they are specially forbidden by the State constitutions. The&nbsp;law of descent is the same in real and personal estate (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Inheritance). </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Manors do not exist, except in the State of New York,&nbsp;where they were created by the crown in colonial days (Bouvier,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Law Diet.,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> “Manor”). Registration of deeds is general (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Registration). </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In some States forms of deed are prescribed by&nbsp;statute. Conveyancing is for the most part simpler than in England. The holding of real estate by religious or charitable corporations is generally restricted by the Act creating them rather than&nbsp;by anything like the English law of mortmain. In Pennsylvania&nbsp;such a corporation cannot hold land without an Act of the legislature, and in Territories of the United States it cannot hold real&nbsp;estate of a greater value than $50,000 (Act of Congress of 1st&nbsp;July 1862, c. 126). Perpetuities are forbidden in most States. The&nbsp;right of eminent domain is at once acknowledged and limited by the&nbsp;constitution of the United States. By art. 5 of the Amendments&nbsp;private property is not to be taken for public use without just compensation. A similar provision is found in many of the State constitutions. By an Act of Congress of 9th April 1866, c. 31, all&nbsp;citizens of the United States have the same right in every State and&nbsp;Territory as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase,&nbsp;lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property. In most&nbsp;States aliens may hold land ; but in some States they cannot do&nbsp;so without becoming naturalized or at least filing in the specified&nbsp;manner a declaration of intention to become naturalized. For the&nbsp;State laws affecting the capacity of aliens to hold land, see Washburn, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Real Property,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> vol. i. p. 64.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">International Law</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">.—The law of the place where real estate is situated </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(lex loci rei sitæ)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> governs its tenure aud transfer. The laws&nbsp;of England and of the United States are more strict on this point&nbsp;than the laws of most other countries. They require that the formalities of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">locus rei sitæ</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> must be observed, even if not necessary&nbsp;to be observed in the place where the contract was made. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">lex&nbsp;loci rei sitæ</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> determines what is to be considered real estate. A&nbsp;foreign court cannot as a general rule pass title to land situated in&nbsp;another country. The English and United States courts of equity&nbsp;have to a certain extent avoided the inconvenience which this inability to deal with laud out of the jurisdiction sometimes causes&nbsp;by the use of the theory that equity acts upon the conscience of&nbsp;the party and not upon the title to the foreign land. Thus in the&nbsp;leading case of Penn </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">v.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Lord Baltimore in 1750 (1 Yesey’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reports,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">444) the Court of Chancery on this ground decreed specific performance of articles for settling the boundaries of the provinces of&nbsp;Pennsylvania and Maryland. The difficulty always arises that,&nbsp;although the court professes to act upon the conscience, it must&nbsp;indirectly act upon the property, and that it cannot carry its decision&nbsp;into execution without the aid of the local tribunals.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RÉAUMUR, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">René Antoine Ferchault de </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1683-1757), tlie eldest son of a French nobleman, was born on 28th February 1683 at La Rochelle and received his early&nbsp;education there. He ·was taught philosophy in the Jesuits’&nbsp;college at Poitiers, and in 1699, when “hardly seventeen,&nbsp;but already possessed of the prudence of a grown man,”&nbsp;went to Bourges to study civil law and mathematics under&nbsp;the charge of an uncle, canon of La Sainte Chapelle. In&nbsp;1703 he came to Paris, where he continued the study of&nbsp;mathematics and physics. He soon made his presence felt&nbsp;in the highest circles, and in 1708, at the remarkably early&nbsp;age of twenty-four, was elected a member of the Académie&nbsp;des Sciences. From this time onwards for nearly half&nbsp;a century hardly a year passed in which the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mémoires de&nbsp;VAcadémie</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> did not contain at least one paper by Reaumur.&nbsp;At first his attention was occupied by mathematical studies,&nbsp;especially in geometry. In 1710 he was appointed to the&nbsp;charge of a great Government Avork—the official description of the useful arts and manufactures—which led him&nbsp;to many practical researches that resulted in the establish</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ment of manufactures new to France and the revival of neglected industries. For discoveries regarding iron and&nbsp;steel the regent Orleans awarded him a pension of 12,000&nbsp;livres ; but, being content with his ample private income,&nbsp;he requested that the money should be secured to the&nbsp;Académie des Sciences for the furtherance of experiments&nbsp;on improved industrial processes. In 1731 he became&nbsp;greatly interested in meteorology, and invented the thermometer which bears his name. In 1735 family arrangements obliged him to accept the post of commander and&nbsp;intendant of the royal and military order of Saint Louis ;&nbsp;he discharged his duties in connexion with it with scrupulous attention, but declined to receive any of the&nbsp;emoluments. Whatever his other occupations Avere, he&nbsp;ahvays found time for the systematic study of natural&nbsp;history, in which he took great delight. He Avas a born&nbsp;naturalist, gifted with rare poAvers of observation and description,—indeed his friends often called him the Pliny&nbsp;of the 18th century. He loved retirement and lived much&nbsp;at his country residences, at one of Avhich, La Bermondière&nbsp;(Maine), he met with an accident, a fall from horseback,&nbsp;the effects of which proved fatal on 17th October 1757.&nbsp;He bequeathed his manuscripts, which filled 138 portfolios, and his natural history collections to the Académie&nbsp;des Sciences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Reaumur Avas a man of wide attainments and great industry. His writings, sometimes on trivial topics, were frequently diffuse, yet&nbsp;always interesting. His mind was original and intensely practical.&nbsp;As a rule he avoided theoretical questions, but Avhen he took them&nbsp;up his manner of treatment Avas remarkably clear, chiefly on account&nbsp;of an ingenious use of metaphor, often expanding into allegory.&nbsp;His memory Avas retentive, his information immense, and his&nbsp;kindliness of disposition such that his knowledge and wealth&nbsp;seemed to be amassed only for the benefit of his friends. He&nbsp;always bore a high character, was a great favourite in society, and&nbsp;associated on terms of intimacy Avith the principal great men of the&nbsp;time in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Reaumur’s scientific papers are too numerous to be recapitulated ; they deal with nearly all branches of science. His first paper, in&nbsp;1708, was on a general problem in geometry, his last, in 1756, on&nbsp;the forms of birds’ nests. He proved experimentally the fact,&nbsp;afterwards demonstrated theoretically by Du Hamel, that the&nbsp;strength of a rope is less than the sum of the strengths of its&nbsp;separate strands. He examined and reported on the auriferous&nbsp;rivers, the turquoise mines, the forests, and the fossil beds of&nbsp;France. He devised the method of tinning iron that is still&nbsp;employed, and investigated the differences betAveen iron and steel,&nbsp;correctly slioAA'ing that the amount of combustible matter (sulphur&nbsp;in the language of the old chemistry) is greatest in cast iron, less&nbsp;in steel, and least in Avrought iron. His book on this subject&nbsp;(1722) Avas translated into English and German. The thermometer by Avhich he is noAv best remembered Avas constructed on the&nbsp;principle of taking the freezing-point of water as 0°, and graduating&nbsp;the tube into degrees each of which Avas one-thousandth of the&nbsp;volume contained by the bulb and tube up to the zero mark. It&nbsp;Avas purely an accident dependent on the dilatability of the particular quality of alcohol employed which made the boiling-point of&nbsp;Avater 80° ; and mercurial thermometers the stems of which are&nbsp;graduated into eighty equal parts between the freezing and boiling&nbsp;points of water are not Reaumur thermometers in anything but name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Reaumur Avrote much on natural history. Early in life ho described the locomotor system of the Echinodermata, and shoAved&nbsp;that the supposed vulgar error of Crustaceans replacing their lost&nbsp;limbs Avas an actual fact. In 1710 he Avrote a paper on the possibility of spiders being used to produce silk, which Avas so celebrated&nbsp;at the time that the Chinese emperor Kang-he caused a translation&nbsp;of it to be made. He treated also of botanical and agricultural&nbsp;matters, and devised processes for preserving birds and eggs. He&nbsp;elaborated a system of artificial incubation, and made important&nbsp;observations on the digestion of carnivorous and graminivorous&nbsp;birds ; but his greatest work is the Mémoires pour servir à l’Histoire&nbsp;des Insectes, 6 vols., with 267 plates, Amsterdam, 1734-49. It&nbsp;describes the appearance, habits, and locality of all the knoAvn&nbsp;insects except the beetles, and is a marvel of patient and accurate&nbsp;observation. Amongst other important facts stated in this work&nbsp;are the experiments which enabled Reaumur to prove the correctness of Peyssonel’s hypothesis, that corals were animals and not&nbsp;plants, as AA׳as previously supposed.</span></p>
