founded by St Maurus (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Maurus),</hi> was the first Benedictine monastery in Gaul. It was situated on the left bank of the Loire about 15 miles below Saumur. About the middle of the 9th century it was reduced to ruins by the Normans ; shortly before the event and in anticipation of it the relics of the saint were transferred to St Maur-les-Foss√©s near Paris. St Maur-sur-Loire was afterwards restored and fortified, but the only extant remains consist of a part of the church and a few shattered columns.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
