                <p><label>SCHWABE, SAMUEL HEINRICH</label> (1789-1875), German astronomer, was born
                    on the 25th of October 1789 at Dessau, where he died on the 11th of April 1875.
                    At first an apothecary, he turned his attention to astronomy, and in 1826
                    commenced his observations on sun-spots. In 1843 he made the suggestion of a
                    probable ten year period <hi rend="italic">(i.e.</hi> that at every tenthÂ» year
                    the number of spots reached a maximum), but it met with scant approval, and he
                    continued his observations, which were</p>

                        rend="italic">Kosmos.</hi> The periodicity of sun-spots is now fully
                    recognized (see Sun); and to Schwabe is thus due the credit of one of the most
                    important discoveries in astronomy.</p>
