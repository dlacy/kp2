Of these smaller rivers, the Arigna, the Fiorish, and tile Gara or Boyle river, are tributaries to the Shannon ; the Bresgue and the Lung, the latter of which flows through a subterraneous channel during part of its course, discharge their contents into Lough Gara. The most remarkable of the lakes, both for size and beauty, is Lough Kea in the northern part, near the town of Boyle, from which place it also takes a name, as likewise that of Rockingham Lake, from the seat of Lord Lorton upon its shore. It is about three miles in length by two in breadth, and studded with several picturesque islands, amongst which Trinity Island is noted for its monastic ruins, and Castle Island for an ancient fortress of the M<hi rend="sup">1</hi>Dermots, now modernized into an elegant villa. The lake derives its supply from the neighbouring boundary lake of Lough Gara upon the borders of Sligo, which, though larger, and still more irregular in its outline, is less attractive in appearance than that on which it bestows its redundant waters. To the north of Lough Kea the two smaller lakes, Lough Skeen and Lough Meelagh, are connected by a short channel with the Shannon. The lakes of Bodarrig, Boflin, and Reagh, on its eastern side, which are, strictly speaking, expansions of the Shannon, may also be considered as partially belonging to the county. The principal of the smaller lakes are Loughs Errit, Glynn, Funcheon, and Aluyn. There are several extensive furloughs or winter lakes, which, being generally dry in summer, afford rich pasturage for sheep. Between Frenchpark and Elphin, that of Mantua covers seven hundred acres ; another near Lough Glynn, in the extreme west of the county, is half a mile long.</p><p>The limestone, which forms the base of all the level districts, is of various kinds, some gray, containing numerous fossil remains, chiefly madrepores ; some of the formation called calp, which is often found blended with layers of Lydian stone ; and some black, being susceptible of a high polish, as is a light gray marble found in the southern parts. Sandstone shows itself in the eminences that protrude through the limestone. Slieve Bawn is mostly composed of it ; and in the neighbourhood of Frenchpark it is raised in laminæ so thin as to be used for the covering of roofs. The northern district is of the coal formation, which extends also into the adjoining county of Leitrim ; but the principal stores of this most valuable mineral, and of ironstone, are to be found on the Roscommon side. The entire area, which is divided into two parts by the Arigna, extends over six thousand five hundred acres, of which two thousand are to the north and four thousand five hundred to the south of that river. The strata of coal rise into the mountains of Bracklieve and Slieve Corkagh, where the outcrop may be distinctly seen in several places in the precipitous sides of the declivities. The coal is of the blazing or bituminous character, less inflammable than that of Scotland, but more so than that of the north of England. The principal beds are the Rover, Gubberother, and Aughabehy collieries, in the latter of which, the chief seam, and the only one deemed sufficiently rich to defray the expense of working, is from one foot to two and a half feet thick, and promises to be abundant in quantity, although subject to interruptions, or wllat the workmen call faults, occasioned by the strata of one part of a hill having slipped down to a depth of from twenty to fifty yards, and settled on a lower level. The principal beds of iron ore are also on the south side of the Arigna river, whence the workings derive their name. They exhibit decisive indications of having been in operation at an early period ; but, most probably in consequence of the exhaustion of timber for fuel, they were latterly inoperative until 1788, when the pit-coal found in the neighbourhood led to a new speculation in them, which, however, was dropped at the end of twenty years. The</p><lb/><p>workings were resumed by three of the mining companies which the extravagant spirit of joint-stock enterprise gave rise to about the year 1825 ; but only one of them, the Arigna company, persevered in the experiment, until involved in a chancery suit as to the right of tenure, which being decided against them in 1836, the works have been resumed by their successful opponent, by whom they are now carried on upon a very extended scale, and with a prospect of adequate remuneration for the capital sunk in the concern. Both the ironstone and the limestone used as a flux have been pronounced to be of prime quality. Potters’ clay is found in several places, and is manufactured into the coarser kinds of wares. Fire-bricks are made at Arigna, of fire-clay, which forms some of the mineral strata there.</p><p>The soil varies nearly according to the nature of its substratum, that on the limestone being much the most productive ; except in the hilly district between the Shannon and the Suck, in which the stone rises so near the surface that the superincumbent vegetable mould is scarcely of denth sufficient to admit the use of the plough. The borders of the rivers which flow through the level parts, and are therefore liable to overflow their banks during winter, becomc, on the return of dry weather, pastures and meadows of the richest quality. Bogs of every size, from an extent of a thousand acres to patches merely adequate for the domestic demands of the immediate neighbourhood in which they lie, are to be found in many parts. The mountains are mostly covered with bog and marsh, interspersed with dry patches on which heath grows most luxuriantly. In the southern part, large tracts of a very light sandy soil, lying on the low hills between the Suck and the Shannon, afford excellent pasturage for sheep. The borders of Lough Aluyn are in some parts formed of sand, apparently carried from the lake by the wind. Large deposits of gravel and different kinds of loam are often found between the surface-soil and the rock which forms the substratum.</p><p>The population, according to calculations made at different periods, was as follows :</p><lb/><table><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Year.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Authority.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Population.</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1760.....</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"/><cell cols="1" rows="1"/></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1792.....</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"/><cell cols="1" rows="1"/></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1812.....</p></cell><cell cols="2" rows="1"><p>.....Parliamentary Return...158,111</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1821.....</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"/><cell cols="1" rows="1"/></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1831.....</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"/><cell cols="1" rows="1"/></row></table><lb/><p>The latest of these returns gives a ratio of one inhabitant to every 2∙54 acres, or of one to every l∙89 cultivated acre. The returns of the Commissioners of Public Instruction in 1834 having been made up according to dioceses, though they do not give results sufficiently accurate to be placed along with those in the preceding table, afford data sufficient respecting the comparative numbers of the three principal religious persuasions, to justify the statement, that if the whole population of the county be estimated at 240,000 (a close approximation to that of 1831), the numbers of Protestants are 7000, and of Roman Catholics 233,000, being an average of one to thirty-three nearly. The total number of protestant dissenters in the county, according to the same return, was but forty-three.</p><p>This population was represented in the Irish parliament by eight members ; two for the county at large, and two for each of the boroughs of Boyle, Roscommon, and Tulsk. The number was reduced to two at the Union, all the boroughs being deprived of the right of election. The number of registered electors for the county is about two thousand ; elections are held at Roscommon. The local government is vested in a lieutenant, ten deputy-lieutenants, all appointed by the crown during pleasure, and a hundred magistrates, in which number thc lieutenant and his deputies are included, appointed by the lord chancellor, and continued during good behaviour.
