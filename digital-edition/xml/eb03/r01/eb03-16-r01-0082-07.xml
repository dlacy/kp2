<p>mental to individuals who have ſuffered by depredations from foreign potentates, our laws have in ſome reſpects armed the fubject. with powers to impel the preroga-tive ; by directing the miniſters of the crown to iffue letters of marque and repriſal upon due demand : the prerogative of granting which is nearly related to, and plainly derived ſrom, that other of making war ; this being indeed only an incomplete ſtate of hoſtilities, and generally ending in a formal denunciation of war. Theſe letters are grantable by the law of nations, whenever the ſubjects of one ſtate are oppreffed and injured by thoſe of another; and juſtice is denied by that ſtate to which the oppreſlbr belongs. In this caſe letters of marque and repriſal words uſed as ſynonymous ; and ſignify-ing, the latter a taking in return, the former the paſſing the frontiers in order to ſuch taking) may be obtained, in order to ſeize the bodies or goods of the ſubjects of the offending ſtate, until fatisfaction be made, where-ever they happen to be found. And indeed this cuſtom of reprifals ſeems dictated by nature herfelf; for which reaſon we ſind in the moſt ancient times very notable inftances of it. But here the neceſſity is obvious of calling in the fovereign power, to determine when reprifals may be made ; elſe every private ſufferer would be a judge in his own cauſe. In purſuance of which principle, it is with us declared by the ſtat. 4 Hen. V. c. 7. that, if any ſubjects of the realm are oppreffed in time of truce by any foreigners, the king will grant marque in due form, to all that feel themſelves grieved, which form is thus directed to be obſerved : the ſuf-ferer muſt firſt apply to the lord privy-feal, and he ſhall make out letters of requeſt under the privy, ſeal; and if after ſuch requeſt of fatisfaction made, the paaty required -do not within convenient time make due fatisfaction or reſtitution to the party grieved, the lord-chancellor ſhall make him out letters of marque under the great ſeal ; and by virtue of theſe he may attack and ſeize the property of the aggreffor nation, without hazard of being condemned as a robber or pirate.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Reprisal, or</hi> <hi rend="italic">Recaption,</hi> is a ſpecies of remedy al-Iowed to an injured perſon. This happens when any one hath deprived another of his property in goods or chattels perfonal, or wrongfully detains one’s wife, child, or ſervant : in which caſe the owner of the goods, and the huſhand, parent, or maſter, may lawfully claim and ■retake them, wherever he happens to find them ; ſo it be not in a riotous manner, or attended with a breach ol the peace. The reaſon for this is obvious ; ſince it may frequently happen that the owner may have this only opportunity of doing himſelf juſtic? : his goods may be afterwards conveyed away or deſtroyed ; and his wife, children, or ſervants, concealed or carried out of his reach ; if he had no ſpeedier remedy than the ordinary proceſs of law. If therefore he can ſo contrive it as to gain poffeſſion of his property again, without force or terror, the law favours and will juſtify his proceeding. But, as the public peace is a ſuperior conſideration to any one man’s private property ; and as, if individuals were once allowed to uſe private force as a remedy for private injuries, all ſocial juſtice -muſt ceaſe, the ſtrong would give law to the weak, and every man would revert to a ſtate of nature ; for theſe reafons it is provided, that this natural right of recaption ſhall never be exerted, where ſueh exertion ■muſt occaſion ſtrife and bodily contention, or endanger</p><p>the peace oſ fociety. If, for inſtance, my horſe is ta-ken away, and I ſind him in a common, a fair, or a public inn, I may lawfully ſeize him to my own uſe : but I cannot juſtify breaking open a private ſtable, or entering on the grounds of a third perſon, to take him, except he be feloniouſiy ſtolen ; but muſt have recourſe to an action at law.</p>
