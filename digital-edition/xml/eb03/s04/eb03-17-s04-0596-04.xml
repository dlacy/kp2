the mould covering the ſurface of the earth, in which vegetables grow. It ſerves as a ſupport for vegetables, and as a reſervoir for receiving and communicating their nouriſhment.</p><p>Soils are commonly double or triple compounds of the ſeveral reputed primitive earths, except the barytic (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Earths).</hi> The magneſian likewiſe sparingly occurs. The more fertile soils afford alſo a ſmall proportion of coally ſubſtance ariſing from putrefaction, and ſome traces of marine acid and gypſum. The vulgar diviſion into clay, chalk, sand, and gravel, is well underſtood. Loam denotes any soil moderately adhesive ; and, according to the ingredient that predominates, it receives the epithets of clayey, chalky, ſandy, or gravelly. The intimate mixture of clay with the oxydes of iron is called <hi rend="italic">till,</hi> and is of a hard conſiſtence and a dark reddiſh colour. Soils are found by analyſis to contain their earthy ingredients in very different proportions. According to M. Giobert, fertile mould in the vicinity of Turin, where the fall of rain amounts yearly to 40 inches, affords for each 100 parts, from 77 to 79 of ſilex, from 8 to 14 of argill, and from 5 to 12 of calx ; beſides about one-half of carbonic matter, and nearly an equal weight of gas, partly carbonic and partly hydrocarbonic. The ſame experimenter repreſents the compoſition of barren soils in ſimilar ſituations to be from 42 to 88 <hi rend="italic">per cent,</hi> of ſilex, from 20 to 30 of argill, and from 4 to 20 of calx. The celebrated Bergman found rich soils in the valleys of Sweden, where the annual quantity of rain is 24 inches, to contain, for each 100 parts, 56 oſ siliceous sand, 14 of argill, and 30 of calx. In the climate of Paris, where the average fall of rain is 20 inches, fertile mixtures, according to M. Tillet, vary from 46 to 52 <hi rend="italic">per cent.</hi> of ſilex, and from 11 to 17 of argill, with 37 of calx. Hence it appears that in dry countries rich earths are of a cloſer texture, and contain more of the calcareous ingredient, with leſs of the siliceous. Mr Arthur Young has diſcovered, that the value of fertile lands is nearly proportioned to the quantities of gas which equal weights of their soil afford by diſtillation.
