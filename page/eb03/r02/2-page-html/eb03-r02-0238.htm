<p><span class="font1">cd </span><span class="font0">upon ſending him the money he demanded ; and this was th« cauſe of his diſgrace and death, which happened ſoon after, with the extirpation of his family and&nbsp;ſriends. Nay, ſuch was the general hatred of this unfortunate miniſter, that the ſoldiers quartered in the cities of Italy no ſooner heard of his death, than they&nbsp;murdered the wives and children of the barbarians whom&nbsp;Stilicho had taken into the ſervice of Honorius. The&nbsp;enraged huſhands went over to Alaric, who made a&nbsp;new demand of money ; which not being readily ſent,&nbsp;he laid ſiege to Rome, and would have taken it, had&nbsp;not the emperor complied with his demand. The ranſom of the city was 5000 pounds of gold, 30,000 of&nbsp;ſilver, 40c. o ſilk garments, 3000 ſhins dyed purple, and&nbsp;3000 pounds of pepper. On this occaſion the heathen&nbsp;temples were ſtripped of their remaining ornaments, and&nbsp;among others of the ſtatue of Valour ; which the pagans did not fail to interpret as a preſage of the ſpeedy&nbsp;ruin of the ſtate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Alaric having received this treaſure, departed ſor a ſhort time : but ſoon after he again blocked up the city&nbsp;with a numerous army ; and again an accommodation&nbsp;with Honorius was ſet on foot. However, for ſome reaſons which do not clearly appear, the treaty was broken off, Rome was a third time beſieged, and at laſt&nbsp;taken and plundered. Alaric, when upqn the point of&nbsp;breaking into the city, addreſſing his ſoldiers, told them,&nbsp;that all the wealth in it was theirs, and therefore he&nbsp;gave them full liberty to ſeize it ; but at the ſame time&nbsp;he ſtrictly enjoined them to ſhed the blood of none but&nbsp;ſuch as they ſhould find in arms ; and above all, to ſpare&nbsp;thoſe 5vh0 ſhould take ſanctuary in the holy places,&nbsp;eſpecially in the churches of the apoſtles St Peter and&nbsp;St Paul ; which he named, becauſe they w<sup>τ</sup>ere moſt ſpacious, and conſequently capable of affording an aſylum&nbsp;to great numbers of people. Having given theſe orders, he abandoned the city to his Goths, who treated&nbsp;it no better, according to St Jerome, than the Greeks&nbsp;are ſaid to have treated ancient Troy ; for after having&nbsp;plundered it for the ſpace of three, or, as others will&nbsp;have it, of ſix days, they ſet fire to it in ſeveral places ;&nbsp;ſo that the ſtately palace of Salluſt, and many other&nbsp;magnificent buildings, were reduced to aſhes ; nay, Procopius writes, that there was not in the whole city one&nbsp;houſe left entire ; and both St Jerome and Philoſtorgius&nbsp;aſſert, that the great metropolis of the empire was reduced to an heap of aſhes and ruins. Though many&nbsp;of the Goths, purſuant to the orders of their general,&nbsp;refrained from ſhedding the blood of ſuch as made no&nbsp;reſiſtance ; yet others, more cruel and blood-thirſty,&nbsp;maſſacred all they met : ſo that the ſtreets in ſome quarters of the city were ſeen covered with dead bodies, and&nbsp;ſwimming. in blood. However, not the leaſt injury&nbsp;was offered to thoſe who fled to the churches ; nay, the&nbsp;Goths themſelves conveyed thither, as to places of ſafety, ſuch as they were deſirous ſhould be ſpared. Many&nbsp;of the ſtatues of the gods that had been leſt entire by</span></p>

However, notwithſtanding theſe accountε, ſome affirm that</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">the city ſuffered very little at this time, not ſo much as when it was taken by Charles V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Alaric did not long ſurvive the taking of Rome, being cut off by a violent fit of ſickneſs in the neighbourhood of Rhegium. After his death the affairs of Honorius ſeemed a little to revive by the defeat and death of Conſtantine and ſome other uſurpers ; but the provinces of Gaul, Britain, and Spain, were now<sup>r</sup> almoſt&nbsp;entirely occupied by barbarians ; in which ſtate they&nbsp;continued till the death of Honorius, which happened&nbsp;in the year 423, after an unfortunate reign of 28&nbsp;years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After ſome uſurpations which took place on the death of Honorius, his nephew Valentinian III. was&nbsp;declared emperor of the weſt, and his mother Placidia&nbsp;regent during his minority. He was ſcarce ſeated on&nbsp;the throne, when the empire was attacked by the Huns&nbsp;under the celebrated Attila. The Romans, however,&nbsp;wretched and degenerate as they were, had they been&nbsp;unanimous, would even yet have been ſuperior to their&nbsp;enemies. The empreſs then had two celebrated generals,&nbsp;Bonifacius and Aetius ; who by their union might have&nbsp;ſaved the empire : but unhappily, through the treachery&nbsp;of Aetius, Bonifacius was obliged to revolt ; and a civil war enſued, in which he loſt his life. Aetius, however, notwithſtanding his treachery, was pardoned, and&nbsp;put at the head of the forces of the empire. He defended it againſt Attila with great ſpirit and ſucceſs,&nbsp;notwithſtanding the deplorable ſituation of affairs, till&nbsp;he was murdered by Valentinian with his own hand,&nbsp;on a ſuſpicion that he aſpired to the empire. But in&nbsp;the mean time the provinces, except Italy itſelf, were&nbsp;totally over·run by the barbarians. Genſeric king of&nbsp;the Vandals ravaged Africa and Sicily ; the Goths,&nbsp;Suevians, Burgundians, &amp;c. had taken poſſeſſion of&nbsp;Gaul and Spain ; and the Britons were oppreſſed by&nbsp;the Scots and Pict⅞, ſo that they were obliged to call&nbsp;in the Saxons to their aſſiſtance, as is related under the&nbsp;article England. In the year 455, Valentinian was&nbsp;murdered by one Maximus, whoſe wife he had raviſhed. Maximus immediately aſſumed the empire ; but&nbsp;felt ſuch violent anxieties, that he deſigned to reſign&nbsp;it and fly out of Italy, in order to enjoy the quiet of&nbsp;a private liſe. However, being diſſuaded from this by&nbsp;his friends, and his own wife dying ſoon after, he forced&nbsp;the empreſs Eudoxia to marry him. Eudoxia, who&nbsp;had tenderly loved Valentinian, provoked beyond meaſure at being married to his murderer, invited Genſeric&nbsp;king of the Vandals into Italy. This proved a moſt&nbsp;fatal ſeheme : for Genſeric immediately appeared before&nbsp;Rome ; a violent tumult enſued, in which Maximus&nbsp;loſt his liſe ; and the city was taken and plundered by&nbsp;Genſeric, who carried off what had been left by the&nbsp;Goths. A veſſel was loaded with coſtly ſtatues ; half&nbsp;the covering of the capitol, which was of braſs plated&nbsp;over with gold ; ſacred veſſels enriched with precious&nbsp;ſtones ; and thoſe which had been taken by Titus out&nbsp;of the temple of Jeruſalem ; all of which were loſt with</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the veſſel in its paſſage to Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nothing could now be more deplorable than the ſtate</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of the Roman affairs : nevertheleſs, the empire continued to exiſt for ſome years longer ; and even ſeemed to revive for a little under Marjoriar&gt;us, who was declared emperor in 458. He was a man of great courage,&nbsp;and poſſeſſed of many other excellent qualities. He</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
