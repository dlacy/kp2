<p><span class="font0">attended the trial of the earl of Strafford, and took shorthand notes of the proceedings. He was much employed as a messenger between the king and the parliament, and- from the&nbsp;nth of April 1644 till the 9th of March 1647 was licenser of&nbsp;pamphlets. When the new model army was formed he was&nbsp;appointed secretary to the parliamentary general, Sir Thomas&nbsp;Fairfax. He was present at the battle of Naseby, of which&nbsp;he wrote an account. When Fairfax, who was offended by the&nbsp;execution of the king, resigned his command, Rushworth was&nbsp;for a short time secretary to Cromwell. He was afterwards&nbsp;employed by the council of state and during the protectorate,&nbsp;and sat in Cromwell’s parliament for Berwick. When Richard&nbsp;Cromwell resigned the protectorate, Rushworth was employed&nbsp;by the Rump after it had been re-established by Monk. He&nbsp;made his peace with the government of Charles II., and though&nbsp;he was threatened with trial as a regicide he was not seriously&nbsp;molested. During the reign of Charles II. he continued to act&nbsp;as agent for the town of Berwick, and he sat for it in parliament. He was also for a time agent for Massachusetts, but&nbsp;the colony complained that it received no advantage from his&nbsp;services. During the last years of his life he fell into poverty,&nbsp;and from 1684 till his death on the 12th of May 1690 he&nbsp;was a resident in the King’s Bench prison. At this time he&nbsp;had destroyed his memory by over-indulgence in drink. The&nbsp;collection of papers which he made was published in eight&nbsp;volumes folio between 1659 and 1701. The volumes from the&nbsp;fourth onwards appeared after his death. The first, which&nbsp;appeared with a dedication to Richard Cromwell, was recalled&nbsp;and the dedication was suppressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUSKIN, JOHN (1819-1900), English writer and critic, was born in London, at Hunter Street, Brunswick Square, on&nbsp;the 8th of February 1819, being the only child of John James&nbsp;Ruskin and Margaret Cox. They were Scots, first cousins, the&nbsp;grandchildren of a certain John Ruskin of Edinburgh (1732-1780). In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Praeterita</span><span class="font0"> the author professes small knowledge of&nbsp;his ancestry. But the memoirs published on the authority&nbsp;of the family trace their descent to the Adairs and Agnews&nbsp;of Galloway. In this family tree are men famous in arms&nbsp;and in the public service: Sir Andrew Agnew of Lochnaw,&nbsp;Admiral Sir John Ross, Field-Marshal Sir Hew Dalrymple&nbsp;Ross, Dr John Adair, in whose arms Wolfe died at Quebec,&nbsp;and the Rev. W. Tweddale of Glenluce, to whom the&nbsp;original Covenant, now in the Glasgow Museum, had been&nbsp;confided. The name Ruskin is said to be a variant of Erskine,&nbsp;or Roskeen, or Rogerkin, and even Roughskin. It is more&nbsp;probably Rusking, an Anglian family, which passed northwards&nbsp;and became Ruskyn, Rusken and Ruskin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">John Ruskin, the author’s grandfather, a handsome lad of twenty, ran away with Catherine Tweddale, daughter of&nbsp;the Covenanting minister and of Catherine Adair, then a&nbsp;beautiful girl of sixteen. He settled in Edinburgh and engaged&nbsp;in the wine trade, lived liberally in the cultivated society of&nbsp;the city, lost his health and his fortune, and ended his days&nbsp;in debt. His son, John James Ruskin (1785-1864), father of&nbsp;the author, was sent to the High School at Edinburgh under&nbsp;Dr A. Adam, received a sound classical education, and was&nbsp;well advised by his friend Dr Thomas Brown, the eminent&nbsp;metaphysician. When of age, John James was sent to London&nbsp;to enter the wine trade. There, in 1809, he founded the sherry&nbsp;business of Ruskin, Telford .&amp; Domecq; Domecq being&nbsp;proprietor of a famous vineyard in Spain, Telford contributing&nbsp;the capital of the firm, and Ruskin having sole control of the&nbsp;business. John James Ruskin, a typical Scot, of remarkable&nbsp;energy, probity and foresight, built up a great business, paid&nbsp;off his father’s debts, formed near London a most hospitable&nbsp;and cultured home, where he maintained his taste for literature and art, and lived and died, as his son proudly wrote&nbsp;upon his tomb, “ an entirely honest merchant.” He was also&nbsp;a man of strong brain, generous nature and fine taste. After&nbsp;a delay of nine years, having at last obtained an adequate&nbsp;income, he married his cousin, Margaret Cox, who had already&nbsp;lived for eighteen years with his mother, the widow of John</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ruskin of Edinburgh. When this marriage of the two cousins, who had known each other all their lives, took place in 1818,&nbsp;neither of them was young. John James was thirty-three and&nbsp;Margaret was thirty-seven. In the following year (8th February 1819) their only child, John, was bom in Hunter Street,&nbsp;London.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Margaret Ruskin, the author’s mother, was a handsome, strong, stem, able, devoted woman of the old Puritan school,&nbsp;Calvinist in religion, unsparing of herself and others, rigid&nbsp;in her ideas of duty, proud, reserved and ungracious. She&nbsp;was the daughter of Captain Cox, of Yarmouth, master mariner&nbsp;in the herring fishery, who died young; whereupon his widow&nbsp;maintained herself as landlady of the King’s Head Inn at&nbsp;Croydon. Her younger daughter married Mr Richardson, a&nbsp;baker, of Croydon; the elder, Margaret, married John James&nbsp;Ruskin. Jessie, a sister of John James, married Peter&nbsp;Richardson, a tanner, of Perth, so that the author had cousins&nbsp;of two Richardson families, unconnected with each other.&nbsp;In his own memoirs he speaks much more of these than of any&nbsp;Ruskins, Tweddales, Adairs or Agnews. The child was brought&nbsp;up under a rigid system of nursing, physical, moral and&nbsp;intellectual; kept without toys, not seldom whipped, wntched&nbsp;day and night, but trained from infancy in music, drawing,&nbsp;reading aloud and observation of natural objects. When&nbsp;he was four the family removed to a house on Heme Hill, then&nbsp;a country village, with a garden and rural surroundings. The&nbsp;father, who made long tours on business, took his wife, child&nbsp;and nurse year after year across England as far as Cumberland&nbsp;and Scotland, visiting towns, cathedrals, castles, colleges, parks,&nbsp;mountains and lakes. At five the child was-taken to Keswick;&nbsp;at six to Paris, Brussels and Waterloo; at seven to Perthshire. At fourteen he was taken through Flanders, along&nbsp;the Rhine, and through the Black Forest to Switzerland,&nbsp;where he first imbibed his dominant passion for the Alps.&nbsp;His youth was largely passed in systematic travelling in search&nbsp;of everything beautiful in nature or in art. And to one so&nbsp;precocious, stimulated by a parent of much culture, ample&nbsp;means and great ambition, this resulted in an almost unexampled aesthetic education. In childhood also he began&nbsp;a systematic practice of composition, both in prose and verse.&nbsp;His mother trained him in reading the Bible, of which he read&nbsp;through every chapter of every book year by year; and to&nbsp;this study he justly attributes his early command of language&nbsp;and his pure sense of style. His father read to him Shakespeare,&nbsp;Scott, Don Quixote, Pope and Byron, and most of the great&nbsp;English classics; and his attention was especially turned to&nbsp;the formation of sentences and to the rhythm of prose. He&nbsp;began to compose both in prose and verse as soon as he had&nbsp;learned to read and write, both of which arts he taught himself&nbsp;by the eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His first letter is dated 1823, when he was only four. In it he corrects his aunt, who had put up the wooden pillars of&nbsp;his Waterloo bridge “ upside down.” At five he was a bookworm. At seven he began a work in four volumes, with&nbsp;“ copper-plates printed and composed by a little boy, and&nbsp;also drawn.” His first poem, correct in rhyme and form,&nbsp;was written before he was seven. At nine he began “ Eudosia,&nbsp;a poem of the Universe.” From that year until his Newdigate&nbsp;Prize, at the age of twenty, he wrote enormous quantities&nbsp;of verse, and began dramas, romances and imitations of&nbsp;Byron, Pope, Scott and Shelley. What remain of these&nbsp;effusions have no special quality except good sense, refined&nbsp;feeling, accuracy of phrase, and a curious correctness of accent&nbsp;and rhythm. Of true poetry in the higher sense there is hardly&nbsp;a single line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His schooling was irregular and not successful. At the age of eleven he was taught Latin and Greek by Dr Andrews, a&nbsp;scholar of Glasgow University. About the same time he bad&nbsp;lessons in drawing and in oil painting from Runciman. French&nbsp;and Euclid were taught by Rowbotham. At fifteen he was&nbsp;sent for two years to the day-school of the Rev. T. Dale of&nbsp;Peckham, and at seventeen he attended some courses in</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
