<p><span class="font1">pride. Rollin ſpoke pretty well; but he had a greater readineſs of writing than ſpeakingt; and much more ſa-tisfaction might be derived from his works than from&nbsp;his ∙co∙nveι ſation. His name became famous throughout Europe ; ſeveral princes ſought the honour of his&nbsp;friendſhip. The duke of Cumberland and the prince-royal of Pruſſia (afterwards king) were among the lift&nbsp;of his admirers. This monarch honoured him with ſeveral letters ; in one of which he pays him the following compliment, “ Men of your character are fit companions for kings.” As to the literary merit of this&nbsp;author, it was, we ſuſpect, too much extolled in his own&nbsp;time, and has been too much undervalued in ours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROLLING, the motion by which a ſhip rocks from ſide to ſide like a cradle, occaſioned by the agitation of the waves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rolling, therefore, is a ſort of revolution about an imaginary axis paſſing through the centre of gravity&nbsp;of a ſhip : ſo that the nearer the centre of gravity is to&nbsp;the keel, the more violent will be the rolling motion ;&nbsp;becauſe the centre about which the vibrations are made&nbsp;is placed ſo low in the bottom, that the reſiſtance made&nbsp;by the keel to the volume of water which it diſplaces&nbsp;in rolling, bears very little proportion to the force of&nbsp;the vibration above the centre of gravity, tlre radius of&nbsp;which extends as high as the maſt-heads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But if the centre of gravity is placed higher above -the keel, the radius of vibration will not only be diminiſhed, but an additional force to oppoſe the motion of&nbsp;rolling will be. communicated to that part of the ſhip’s&nbsp;bottom which is below the centre of gravity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So far as relates to the effect of rolling, when produced by the quality or ſtowage of the ballaſt, and to the manner by which it may be prevented, viz. a&nbsp;change of the quantity or diſpoſition of the ballaſt, we&nbsp;ſliall endeavo-ur to explain under the article Trim. It&nbsp;may, however, be neceſſary to remark, that the conſtruction of the ſhip’s bottom may alſo contribute to&nbsp;ſtiminiſh this movement conſiderably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many fatal diſaſters have happened to ſhips ariſing ſrom a violent rolling ; as the loſs of the maſts, looſen-ing of the cannon, and ſtraining violently on the decks&nbsp;and ſides, ſo as to weaken the ſhip to a great degree.&nbsp;See Pitching.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROLLO, the conqueror of Normandy, was a Norwegian duke, baniſhed from his country by Harold Harfagre, who conquered Norway in 870, on account&nbsp;-of the piracies he exerciſed. He firſt retired with his&nbsp;fleet among the iſlands of the Hebrides to the north-weſt of Scotland, whither the flower of the Norwegian&nbsp;nöbility had fled for refuge «ver ſince Harold had become maſter of the whole kingdom. He was there received with open arms by thoſe warriors, who, eager&nbsp;for conq,ueft and revenge, waited only for a chief to&nbsp;undertake ſome glorious enterpriſe. Rollo ſetting&nbsp;himſelf at their head, and ſeeing his power formidable,&nbsp;ſailed towards England, which had been long as it&nbsp;were a field open on all ſides ito the violence of the&nbsp;northern nations. But the great Alfred had ſome&nbsp;years before eſtabliſhed ſuch order in his part of the&nbsp;iſland, that Rollo, after ſeveral fruitleſs attempts, de-ſpaired of forming there ſuch a ſettlement as ſhould&nbsp;make him amends for the loſs of his own country. He&nbsp;pretended, therefore, to have had a ſupematural dream,&nbsp;which promiſed him a glorious fortune in France, and&nbsp;which ſerved at leaſt to ſupport the ardour of his followers. The weakntſs of die government in that;&nbsp;kingdom, and the confuſion in which it was involved,&nbsp;were ſtill moιe perſuaſive reaſons to inſure them of&nbsp;ſucceſs. Having therefore failed up the Seine to&nbsp;Rouen, he immediately took that capital of the province, then called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Neu/lria,</span><span class="font1"> and making it his magazine of arms, he advanced up to Paris, to which he&nbsp;laid ſiege in form. This war at length ended in the&nbsp;entire cefiiαn of Neuſtria, which Charles the Simple&nbsp;was obliged to give up to Rollo and his Normans in&nbsp;order to purchaſe a peace. Rollo received it in perpetuity to himſelf and his poſterity, as a feudal duchy dependant on the crown of France. A deſcription of the&nbsp;interview between Charles and this new duke gives us&nbsp;a curious picture of the manners of theſe Normans (as&nbsp;they were called by foreigners) ; for the latter would&nbsp;not take the oath of fealty to his ſovereign lord any&nbsp;other way than by placing his hands within thoſe of the&nbsp;king ; and abſolutely refiiſed to kiſs his feet, as cuſtom&nbsp;then required. It was with great difficulty he was prevailed on to let one of his warriors perform this ceremony in his ſtead ; but the officer to whom Rollo deputed,&nbsp;this ſervice, ſuddenl.y raiſed the king’s foot ſo high, that&nbsp;he overturned him on his back ; a piece of rudeneſs&nbsp;which was only laughed at; to ſuch a degree were the&nbsp;Normans feared, and Charles deſpiſed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Soon after* Rollo was perſuaded to embrace Chriſti-anity, and hc was baptized with much ceremony by the archbiſhop of Rouen in the cathedral of that city. As&nbsp;foθH as he ſaw himſelf in full poſſeſſion of Normandy,&nbsp;he exhibited ſuch virtues as rendered the province happy, and deſerved to make his former outrages forgotten.&nbsp;Religious, wiſe, and liberal, this captain of pirates became, after Alfred, the greateſt and moſt humane prince&nbsp;of his time-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>;</sub></span></p>
