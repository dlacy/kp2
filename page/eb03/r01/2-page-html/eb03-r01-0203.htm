<p><span class="font2">the nation has the imprefcriptible right </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">changing its conſtitution ; and nevertheleſs conſidering that it&nbsp;is more conformable to the national intereſt to employ&nbsp;only by means provided in the conſtitution itſelf, the&nbsp;right of reforming thoſe articſes of it, of which experience ſhall have ſhown the inconveniencies, decrees,&nbsp;that the proceeding by an- aſſembly of reviſion ſhali be&nbsp;regulated in the form following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“ when three ſucceſſive legiſſatures ſhall have ex-preffed au uniform wiſh for the change of any conſtitu-tional article, the reviſſon demanded ſhali take place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot; The next legiſſature, and the following, cannot propoſe the reform of any conſtitutional article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot; The fourth legiſſature, augmented with 249 members, choſen in each department, by doubling the ordinary number wliich it furniſhes in proportion to its population, ſhall form the affembly of reviſion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The French colonies and poffeffions in Alia, Africa, and America, &quot; though they form part of the French&nbsp;empire,” are not included in the preſent conftitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">with reſpect to the laws made by the national aſe ſembly which are not included in the act of conſtitu-tion, and thoſe anterior laws which it has not altered,&nbsp;they ſhall be obſerved, ſo long as they ſhall not be revoked or modified by the legiſſative power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the 13th of September the King announced, by a letter to the Preſident of the Affembly, his accept-ance of the conftitution. This event was ordered to&nbsp;be notified to all the foreign courts, and the Affembly&nbsp;decreed a general amneſty with reſpect to the events of&nbsp;the revolution. On the following day the King repaired fin perſon to rhe National Aſſembly; and being&nbsp;conducted to a chair of ſtate prepared for him at the&nbsp;ſide oſ the Preſident, he ſigned the conſtitutional act,&nbsp;and took an oath of fidelity to it. He then withdrew,&nbsp;and was attended back to the Thuilleries by the whole&nbsp;Affembly, with the Preſident at their head. On the&nbsp;30th of September, tliis National Affembly, which has&nbsp;ſince been known by the name of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ConfUtuent AJfem-bly,</span><span class="font2"> diſſolved itſelf, and gave place to the ſucceeding&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Leſtſtative National Affembly,</span><span class="font2"> which had been elected&nbsp;according to the rules preſcribed by the new conſtitu-tion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the character and the labours of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Conſtituent Affembly,</span><span class="font2"> we ſhall only remark, that it contained many&nbsp;men of talents, and, in all probability, a conſiderable&nbsp;number of men of integrity. Towards the clofe of its&nbsp;ſeffion, it affumed a very ſtriking character of modera-tion, and appears to have been completely monarchical,&nbsp;although its jealouſy oſ tlie ancient ariſtocracy pre-vented it from ſufficiently guarding the throne againſt&nbsp;popular violence ; for a very ſtriking defect in the new&nbsp;couſtitution ſoon appeared. The King poſſeffed a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">veto,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">or negative, upon the reſolutions of the legiſiative body: but this negative he was bound to exerciſe in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">perfon,</span><span class="font2"> without reſponſibility, and without the intervention of his miniſters. He had no ſenate, or upper&nbsp;chamber, to ſtand between him and popular violence ;&nbsp;and there was ſomething apparently abſurd in ſettling&nbsp;the vote of an individual, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">»1 </span><span class="font2">oppoſition to the collective&nbsp;wifdom and will of a whole nation·. In conſequence of&nbsp;this, he was reduced to the hard alternative of yielding&nbsp;to every vote of the National Affembly, or of expoſing&nbsp;himſelf perſonally to public odium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The new Aſſembly was opened by the King on the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2">7th of October, with much apparent union op. all ſides. His ſpeech, recommending unanimity aud conſidence between the legiſſative and executive powers, was&nbsp;received with unbounded applauſe. The character of&nbsp;the men who compoſed the new National Affembly was&nbsp;unauſpicions to the Court. At the commencement of&nbsp;the revolution, the great body of the people at a diſtance from the capital were little intereſted in thoſe projects of freedom which occupied the more enlightened&nbsp;or more turbulent inhabitants of Paris. They had gra-dually, however, been roufed from their lethargy. The&nbsp;variety of powers conferred by the new conſtitution upon the people at large, and the multiplicity of offices of&nbsp;which it gave them the patronage, had kindled in the&nbsp;minds of men a love of dominion, and a wiſh to inter-fere in public affairs. This attached them to the new&nbsp;order of things. The love of power, which is the leaſt&nbsp;difguiſed paffion in the human heart, and equally ſtrong&nbsp;in the breaſt of the meaneſt and of the higheſt of mankind, was thus, under the name of liberty, become a&nbsp;leading paffion throughout this wide empire. They&nbsp;who flattered it moſt, and were moſt loud in praiſe of&nbsp;the rights of the people, became ſpeedily the favourites&nbsp;of the public. The conſequence of this was, that the&nbsp;new National Aſſembly was chiefly compoſed oſ conn-try gentlemen, of principles highly democratic, or oſ&nbsp;men of letters who had publiſhed popular books,&nbsp;or conducted periodical publications. The members of&nbsp;the Conſtituent Affembly had been excluded by their&nbsp;own decree from holding feats in the new legiſlature.—-The members of the latter, theiefore, had little regard,&nbsp;for a conſtitution which they themſelves had not framed,&nbsp;and whieh was not protected by the venerable ſanction&nbsp;of antiquity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">when this Aſſembly ſirſt met, it ſhowed a very triſſmg attentlon to formalitles, and a peevlſh jealouſy&nbsp;of the miniſters of the crown. In the mean time, the&nbsp;treaty of Pilnitz, already mentioned, began to be rumoured abroad, and France was thrown into a ſtate of&nbsp;anxious jealoufy for the ſaſety of its newly-acquired&nbsp;liberties. Although the Pruffians and Germans (the&nbsp;Elector of Mentz alone excepted) all continued to&nbsp;temporize, the northern powers, Sweden and Ruffia,&nbsp;entered into ſtrict engagements to reſtore the old def-potiſm of France. On the 9th of November, a decree&nbsp;was paffed, that the emigrants who, after the ſirſt of&nbsp;January next, ſhould be found affembled, as at preſent,&nbsp;in a hoſtile manner, beyond the frontiers, ſhould be&nbsp;conſidered as guilty of a conſpiracy, and ſuffer death ;&nbsp;that the French Princes, and public functionaries, wlio&nbsp;ſhould not return before that period, ſhould be puniſh-able in the fame manner, and their property forfeited&nbsp;during their own lives. On the 18th, a ſeriesof ſevere decrees was alſo paffed againſt ſucli of the ejected&nbsp;clergy as ſtill refuſed to take the civic oath. To both-theſe decrees the King oppoſed his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">veto,</span><span class="font2"> or negative.—&nbsp;The moderate party,, who were attached to the conſti-tution, rejoiced at this as a proof of the freedom of&nbsp;their ſovereign. But, on the other ſide, it excited a&nbsp;moſt violent clamour, and became the means of exciting&nbsp;new ſufpſcion of the wiſhes of the Court. At this&nbsp;time. anſwers were received from thc different foreign&nbsp;Courts to the notification ſent them of the King’s acceptance of the new conſtitution. Theſe were generally conceived in a ſtile of caution, and avoided giving</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
