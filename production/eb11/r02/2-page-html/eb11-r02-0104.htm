<p><span class="font0">merely regarded as Amphibia because they closely resemble the genera which are proved to have been gill-breathers when&nbsp;immature. All these genera, however, so far as known, agree&nbsp;with the existing Amphibia in the production of their large&nbsp;parasphenoid bone as far forwards as the vomers to form a&nbsp;rigid and complete basicranial axis (fig. i, A). Those genera&nbsp;which less resemble the typical Labyrinthodonts are characterized by the reduction of the parasphenoid bone so that it no&nbsp;longer reaches the vomers; in these animals the weakened skull&nbsp;exhibits a secondary basicranial axis formed by the approximation of the pterygoids to the median line (fig. i, B). The&nbsp;latter condition is universal in existing reptiles, and may therefore perhaps be regarded as a diagnostic feature. If so, the&nbsp;oldest known undoubted reptile is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Palaeohalleria,</span><span class="font0"> from the&nbsp;Lower Permian of Saxony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the structure of the skull </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Palaeohatteria</span><span class="font0"> is much Hke the existing </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon,</span><span class="font0"> the cheek-plates which cover the temporal&nbsp;and masseter muscles on each side being pierced by two great&nbsp;vacuities, one superior-temporal, the other lateral-temporal.&nbsp;The majority of the earliest reptiles, however, either resemble the&nbsp;Labyrinthodonts in having the biting muscles completely&nbsp;covered with a roof of bony plates, or exhibit a slight shrinkage,&nbsp;of this investment so that a superior-temporal vacuity appears.&nbsp;As the various groups or orders become differentiated, this&nbsp;shrinkage or reduction continues, while the shape of the ossifying ear-capsule changes, and the squamosal bone, which covers&nbsp;the organ of hearing in the fishes, and presumably also in the&nbsp;Palaeozoic Batrachia, is gradually thrust outwards from all&nbsp;connexion with this capsule except at its hinder angle. The&nbsp;resultant modifications are diagrammatically represented in&nbsp;fig 2. In one series of orders, comprising the Anomodontia,&nbsp;Chelonia, Sauropterygia and Ichthyopterygia (fig. 2, B, C),&nbsp;the superior-temporal vacuity (s) first appears, and the cheek-plates in the broad temporal arch thus formed may be variously&nbsp;fused together, sometimes even irregularly perforated—showing&nbsp;at first, indeed, the usual inconstancy of a new and not completely established feature. From the earliest members of this&nbsp;series of reptiles, palaeontology seems to demonstrate that the&nbsp;Mammalia (with one robust temporal arcade or zygomatic arch)&nbsp;arose. In a second series, comprising the orders Rhyncho-cephalia, Dinosauria, Crocodilia and Ornithosauria (fig. 2, D)<sub>;&nbsp;</sub>the broad arch of cheek-plates is regularly pierced by a lateral-temporal vacuity, which leaves a narrow bar above, another&nbsp;narrow bar below, and uncovers the middle part of the quadrate&nbsp;bone. By the constant loss of the lower, and the frequent loss&nbsp;of the upper, bar, some members of this series eventually pass&nbsp;into the order Squamata (Lacertilia-FOphidia), in which the&nbsp;quadrate bone is completely exposed and loosely attached to&nbsp;the skull (fig. 2, E); other reptiles exhibiting a similar modification may readily have acquired the typical Avian skull&nbsp;(fig. 2, F) by the loss of the upper and the retention of the lower</span></p>
