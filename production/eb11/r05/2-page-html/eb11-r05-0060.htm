<p><span class="font0">RUDDER (O.E. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rother, i.e.</span><span class="font0"> rower), that part of the steering apparatus of a ship which is fastened to the stern outside,&nbsp;and on which the water acts directly. The word may be&nbsp;found to be used as if it were synonymous with “ helm.”&nbsp;But the helm (A.S. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hillf,</span><span class="font0"> a handle) is the handle by which the&nbsp;rudder is worked. The tiller, which is perhaps derived from a&nbsp;provincial English name for the handle of a spade, has the&nbsp;same meaning as the helm. In the earliest times a single oar,&nbsp;at the stern, was used to row the vessel round. In later times&nbsp;oars with large blades were fixed on the sides near the stern.&nbsp;In Greek and Roman vessels two sets were sometimes employed,&nbsp;so that if the pitching of the ship lifted the after pair out of the&nbsp;water, the foremost pair could still act. As these ancient ships&nbsp;were, at least in some cases, sharp at both ends and could sail&nbsp;either way, steer (or steering) oars were fixed both fore and aft.&nbsp;The steer oar in this form passed through a ring on the side and&nbsp;was supported on a crutch, and was turned by a helm, or tiller.&nbsp;Norse and medieval vessels had, as far as we. can judge, one&nbsp;steer oar only placed on the right side near the stern—hence&nbsp;the name “starboard,” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> steerside, for the right side of the&nbsp;ship looking forward. In the case of small vessels the steer&nbsp;oar possesses an advantage over the rudder, for it can bring&nbsp;the stern round quickly. Therefore it is still used in whaling&nbsp;boats and rowing boats which have to work against wind and&nbsp;tide, and in surf when the rudder will not act. It is not possible&nbsp;to assign any date for the displacement of the side rudder by&nbsp;the stern, rudder. They were certainly used together, and the&nbsp;second displaced the first in the course of the 14th century&nbsp;when experience had shown that the rudder was more effective&nbsp;at the stern than at the side. The rudder of a wooden ship&nbsp;when fully developed was composed of four pieces. The first&nbsp;or main piece was hung on to the stern post of the ship. Its&nbsp;upper portion was known as the rudder head, and was at first&nbsp;an oval shaft which passed into the ship through the rudder&nbsp;port, and to which the helm was fixed. A canvas bag called&nbsp;a rudder coat covered the opening to exclude the water. In&nbsp;later days Sir R. Seppings introduced the cylindrical form in&nbsp;order to prevent the water from coming into the round rudder&nbsp;port. Three back pieces were fastened to the main piece longitudinally. The whole were fastened together by iron bands&nbsp;called pintle straps, which had at the forward end a pin or&nbsp;pintle, which fitted into braces, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> fixed rings on the stern&nbsp;post, so that the rudder hung on lunges. The lower part of&nbsp;the main piece was bevelled, and so was the stern post, so as to&nbsp;allow the rudder to swing freely. A projecting piece called a&nbsp;chock or wood-lock was fixed in the head outside the ship in&nbsp;order to prevent the rudder from being lifted by the water out&nbsp;of its hinges. A small vessel can be steered by the helm or&nbsp;tiller, but in a larger it is necessary to apply a mechanical&nbsp;leverage. This was secured by carrying ropes, or in later times&nbsp;chains, to the sides of the ship, and then through blocks to the&nbsp;upper deck, round a barrel which is worked by the wheel. The&nbsp;principle of the rudder cannot alter, but the means employed&nbsp;to work it have been altered by the introduction of the screw,&nbsp;and by the increased size of ships. A single screw is placed in&nbsp;an open space before the stern post. As the opening thus&nbsp;created prevents the water from flowing directly on to the&nbsp;rudder, a screw steamer is sometimes difficult to steer. In&nbsp;order to make the rudder more manageable, it has been balanced,&nbsp;f.e. pivoted, on a shaft placed at about a third of its length from&nbsp;the foremost edge. In a double screw there is no opening, but&nbsp;the balanced rudder is still used, and the ship can be turned by&nbsp;reversing one of the screws. The need for more power to work&nbsp;the helm has led to the introduction of steam, and hydraulic&nbsp;steering apparatus which can be set in motion by a small wheel.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUDDIMAN, THOMAS (1674-1757), Scottish classical scholar, was born in October 1674, at Raggal, Banffshire, where his father&nbsp;was a farmer. He was educated at Aberdeen University, and&nbsp;through the influence of Dr Archibald Pitcairne he was made&nbsp;assistant in the Advocates’ Library, Edinburgh. His chief&nbsp;writings at this period were editions of Florence Wilson’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De&nbsp;Animi Tranquillitate Dialogus</span><span class="font0"> (1707), and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cantici Solomonis&nbsp;Paraphrasis Poetica</span><span class="font0"> (1709) of Arthur Johnston (1587-1641),&nbsp;editor of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Deliciae Poetarum Scotorum.</span><span class="font0"> On the death of Dr&nbsp;Pitcairne he edited his friend’s Latin verses, and arranged for&nbsp;the sale of his valuable library to Peter the Great of Russia.&nbsp;In 1714 he published </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rudiments of the Latin Tongue</span><span class="font0">, which was&nbsp;long used in Scottish schools. In 1715 he edited, with notes and&nbsp;annotations, the works of George Buchanan in two volumes&nbsp;folio. As Ruddiman was a Jacobite, the liberal views of&nbsp;Buchanan seemed to him to call for frequent censure. A society&nbsp;of scholars was formed in Edinburgh to “ vindicate that incomparably learned and pious author from the calumnies of Mr&nbsp;Thomas Ruddiman”; but Ruddiman’s remains the standard&nbsp;edition, though George Logan, John Love, John Man and&nbsp;others attacked him with great vehemence. He founded (1715)&nbsp;a successful printing business, and in 1728 was appointed printer&nbsp;to the university. He acquired the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Caledonian Mercury</span><span class="font0"> in 1729,&nbsp;and in 1730 was appointed keeper of the Advocates’ Library,&nbsp;resigning in 1752. He died in Edinburgh, on the 19th of January&nbsp;1757-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Besides the works mentioned, the following writings of Ruddiman deserve notice: An edition of Gavin Douglas’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aeneid</span><span class="font0"> of Virgil&nbsp;(1710); the editing and completion of Anderson’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Selectus Diplo-matum et Numismatum Scotiae Thesaurus</span><span class="font0"> (1739); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Catalogue of the&nbsp;Advocates' Library</span><span class="font0"> (1733-42); and a famous edition of Livy (1751).&nbsp;He also helped Joseph Ames with the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Typographical Antiquities.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Ruddiman was for many yeârs the representative scholar of Scotland.&nbsp;Writing in 1766, Dr Johnson, after reproving Boswell for some bad&nbsp;Latin, significantly adds—“ Ruddiman is dead.” When Boswell&nbsp;proposed to write Ruddiman’s life, “ I should take pleasure in&nbsp;helping you to do honour to him,” said Johnson.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUDE, FRANÇOIS (1784-1855), French sculptor, was born at Dijon on the 4th of June 1784. Till the age of sixteen he&nbsp;worked at his father’s trade as a stovemaker, but in 1809 he&nbsp;went up to Paris from the Dijon school of art, and became a&nbsp;pupil of Castellier, obtaining the Grand Prix in 1812. After&nbsp;the second restoration of the Bourbons he retired to Brussels,&nbsp;where he got some work under the architect Van der Straeten,&nbsp;who employed him to execute nine bas-reliefs in the palace of&nbsp;Tervueren. At Brussels Rude married Sophie Fremiet, the&nbsp;daughter of a Bonapartist compatriot to whom he had many&nbsp;obligations, but gladly availed himself of an opportunity to&nbsp;return to Paris, where in 1827 a statue of the Virgin for St Gervais&nbsp;and a “ Mercury fastening his Sandals ” (now in the Louvre)&nbsp;obtained much attention. His great success dates, however,&nbsp;from 1833, when he received the cross of the Legion of Honour for&nbsp;his statue of a “ Neapolitan Fisher Boy playing with a Tortoise,”&nbsp;which also procured for him the important commission for all&nbsp;the ornament and one group in the Arc de l’Étoile. This group,&nbsp;the “ Départ des volontaires de 1792,” a work full of energy and&nbsp;fire, immortalizes the name of Rude. Amongst other productions we may mention the statue of the mathematician&nbsp;Gaspard Monge (1848), Jeanne d’Arc, in the gardens of the&nbsp;Luxembourg (1852), a Calvary in bronze for the high altar of&nbsp;St Vincent de Paul (1855), as well as “ Hebe and the Eagle of&nbsp;Jupiter,” “ Love Triumphant ” and “ Christ on the Cross,” all of&nbsp;which appeared at the Salon of 1857 after his death. He died&nbsp;suddenly on the 3rd of November 1855.</span></p>
