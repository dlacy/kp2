<p><span class="font1">at Peterborough another tractate from his pen, entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Super Symbolum.</span><span class="font1"> Of neither of these works, however,&nbsp;does any known copy now exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Speculum</span><span class="font1"> the main value may be said to be of a negative character, in that it affords the most conclusive&nbsp;proof of the spuriousness of another work attributed to&nbsp;Richard and long accepted by the learned world as his.&nbsp;This was the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Situ Britanniæ,</span><span class="font1"> an elaborate forgery&nbsp;relating to the antiquities of Roman Britain which first&nbsp;appeared at Copenhagen in the year 1758. It was printed&nbsp;along with the works of Gildas and Nennius, under the&nbsp;editorship of Charles Julius Bertram, professor of English&nbsp;in the academy of Copenhagen in the middle of the last&nbsp;century, with the following special title :—“ Richardi&nbsp;Corinensis monachi Westmonasteriensis de situ Britanniæ&nbsp;libri duo. E Codici MS. descripsit, Notisque et Indice&nbsp;adornavit Carolus Bertram.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This forgery was accepted, as genuine by a well-known antiquary of the last century, Dr William Stukeley, and under the sanction&nbsp;of his authority continued for a long time to be regarded in the&nbsp;same light by numerous scholars and antiquaries. Among their&nbsp;number were Gibbon, John Whitaker, Richard Gough, and&nbsp;Lingard. On the other hand, critics of a later date, such as&nbsp;J. J. Conybeare, Dr Guest, Wex, Raine, and Woodward, from time&nbsp;to time gave expression, on various grounds, to a contrary conclusion. All doubt on the subject may, however, be held to have&nbsp;been effectually set at rest by the masterly and exhaustive exposure&nbsp;of the whole fraud drawn up by Professor Mayor in the preface to&nbsp;the edition above referred to of the Speculum. He has there not&nbsp;only demonstrated, from the external and internal evidence alike,&nbsp;the spuriousness of the whole treatise, but in a collation (extending&nbsp;to nearly a hundred pages) of numerous passages with corresponding&nbsp;passages in classical mediæval authorities, has also traced out the&nbsp;various sources from whence Bertram derived the terminology and&nbsp;the facts which he reproduced in the De Situ. “To say nothing,”&nbsp;says Professor Mayor, “of antiquaries whose canons of criticism are&nbsp;so lax that they cite a supposed monk of 1400 a.d. as authority for&nbsp;events of 1000 b.c., we find a forger alike contemptible as penman,&nbsp;Latinist, historian, geographer, critic, imposing upon members of&nbsp;the Royal and Antiquarian Societies, and of the two ancient&nbsp;universities, of the youthful Society D. U. K., on the writers of&nbsp;Germany and Denmark, of England, and of Scotland,—the last&nbsp;bribed by the invention of Vespasiana.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J. B. M.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICHARD of Sτ Victor (oδ. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font1"> 1173), a Scot by birth, was subprior of his convent in 1159 and prior in 1162,&nbsp;and was a friend of St Bernard, to whom some of his&nbsp;books are dedicated. The tendency of his mysticism has&nbsp;been characterized in vol. xvii. p. 132. Of his works,&nbsp;which embrace exegesis, moral and dogmatic subjects, and&nbsp;mystical contemplation, the first edition appeared at Paris&nbsp;in 1528, the best at Rouen in 1650.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICHARDSON, Sir John (1787-1865), naturalist, was born at Dumfries on November 5, 1787, and died&nbsp;near Grasmere on June 5, 1865. He became a surgeon in&nbsp;the navy in 1807, and is known by his share in the arctic&nbsp;explorations of Parry and Franklin, 1819-22 and 1825-26&nbsp;(see Polar Regions, vol. xix. p. 319), and in the Franklin&nbsp;search expedition of 1848-49 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(fib.,</span><span class="font1"> p. 321), but especially by&nbsp;his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fauna Boreali-Americana</span><span class="font1"> (1829-37, 4 vols. 4 to).&nbsp;He also wrote </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Arctic Searching Expedition</span><span class="font1"> (1851), and&nbsp;other works on the zoology of the Arctic regions. He was&nbsp;knighted in. 1846.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICHARDSON, Samvel (1689—1761), as the inventor or the accidental discoverer of a new literary form, the&nbsp;modern novel of domestic life and manners, is entitled to a&nbsp;more prominent place in history than his powers, whether&nbsp;of thought or style, would justify. He stumbled on novel&nbsp;writing by accident and late in life. The son of a Derbyshire joiner (born in 1689), he had been apprenticed at the&nbsp;age of seventeen to a London printer (Wilde of Stationers’&nbsp;Hall), had spent some years as a press reader or proof&nbsp;corrector—not a bad position for acquiring some knowledge of literature—had married his master’s daughter,&nbsp;and acquired an extensive business, trying his hand&nbsp;occasionally in composition as a writer of prefaces and&nbsp;dedications to the books that he printed. When he was&nbsp;near the age of fifty some bookseller friends of his, struck&nbsp;perhaps by the excellence of his letters, had suggested to&nbsp;him that he should compose a “familiar letter-writer”—&nbsp;“ a little volume of letters, in common style, on such subjects as might be of use to those country readers who were&nbsp;unable to indite for themselves. ” Richardson improved&nbsp;upon the suggestion. As it happened, he had had a&nbsp;singular experience in the way of writing letters for&nbsp;others. When he was a boy of thirteen three young&nbsp;women λvho could not write had employed him to conduct&nbsp;their correspondence with their sweethearts, which he did,&nbsp;he tells us, much to the satisfaction of his employers and&nbsp;without betraying their confidence. It occurred to him,&nbsp;turning over the project of the booksellers in his mind,&nbsp;and reverting to this early experience, that he might tell&nbsp;a story in a series of letters which would serve equally&nbsp;well as models for letter-writing and at the same time&nbsp;cultivate the principles of virtue and religion in the minds&nbsp;of the youth of both sexes. Accordingly, the publication&nbsp;being for country readers, he chose a country girl, Pamela,&nbsp;in the service of a young squire Mr B. (Fielding afterwards expanded the initial to “ Booby ”), and made- her&nbsp;relate in letters to her friends her experiences from day to&nbsp;day and week to week in very trying circumstances.&nbsp;Friends write to advise Pamela in her difficulties, and so&nbsp;the story is carried on with circumstantial minuteness,&nbsp;Pamela describing with the most careful elaboration every&nbsp;particular of what happens to her, and adding her own&nbsp;reflexions, surmises, and appeals for approbation and&nbsp;counsel. The natural effect of this method is that, if we&nbsp;have any sympathy with the heroine, we get intensely&nbsp;interested in her perplexities,—the very fulness of the&nbsp;details and the close truth to nature with which the&nbsp;novelist follows every turn in the girl’s thoughts compelling us to read on. This effect was fully realized in&nbsp;days when the voluminous moralizing was more in harmony with the general taste than it is now, and the kind&nbsp;of thing was new and fresh. The success of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela</span><span class="font1"> was&nbsp;immediate and widespread, and extended at once far&nbsp;beyond the circle of country cousins for whom it was&nbsp;designed. It is said that ladies at Ranelagh Gardens&nbsp;were to be seen holding up one to another their copies of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela</span><span class="font1"> to show that they had in their possession the most&nbsp;popular book of the day. The industrious antiquary has&nbsp;cast doubt upon this anecdote, pointing out that Ranelagh&nbsp;Gardens were not open to the public till eighteen months&nbsp;after </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela</span><span class="font1"> had begun to run through many editions.&nbsp;Vauxhall, however, was open if Ranelagh was not, and&nbsp;the incident may have been observed there. At any rate&nbsp;the fact expressed by the anecdote is true enough, that&nbsp;the novel was at once and universally popular. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the first of one long line of novels, was published in&nbsp;November 1740. In January 1741 the following appeared&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gentleman's Magazine</span><span class="font1"> :—“Several encomiums on a&nbsp;series of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Familiar Letters,</span><span class="font1"> published but last month,&nbsp;entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded,</span><span class="font1"> came too late for&nbsp;this magazine, and we believe there will be little occasion&nbsp;for inserting them in our next, because a second edition&nbsp;will then come out to supply the demands of the country,&nbsp;it being judged in town as great a sign of want of curiosity&nbsp;not to have read </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela</span><span class="font1"> as not to have seen the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">French&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Italian</span><span class="font1"> Dancers.” This testimony is hardly less&nbsp;quaint and significant than the accredited anecdote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It was thus that this industrious prosperous printer, a stout, rosy, vain, precise little man, carrying himself with&nbsp;sensitive dignity, not at all the kind of man that might&nbsp;have been expected to be a fashionable novelist, stumbled&nbsp;in the natural course of his business upon a new species&nbsp;of composition for which he had an unsuspected genius.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
