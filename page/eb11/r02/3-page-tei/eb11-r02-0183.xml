            <p>the average daily consumption of the workman. . . . Barley was largely the food of
                the poor.” According to the words just quoted from the Apocalypse, there was to be a
                dearth of grain and a superfluity of wine; the price of the wheat was to be seven
                times the ordinary, according to Reinach<hi rend="sup">5</hi>S computation, and that
                of the barley four times. This strange statement suggested some historical allusion,
                and the discovery of the allusion was made by Reinach, who points out that Domitian
                by an edict in<hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 92 prohibited the planting of
                new vineyards in Italy, and ordered the reduction of those in the provinces by
                one-half. As Asia Minor suffered specially under this edict, an agitation was set on
                foot which resulted in thc revocation of the edict. In this revocation the
                Apocalyptist saw the menace of a famine of the necessaries of life, while the
                luxuries would remain unaffected. From his ascetic standpoint the revocation of the
                edict could only pander to drunkenness and immorality. Reinach<hi rend="sup">5</hi>S
                explanation of this ancient <hi rend="italic">crux interpretum,</hi> which has been
                accepted by Harnack, Bousset, Porter, Sanday, Swete and others, fixes the earliest
                date of the composition of the Apocalypse as a.d. 93. Since Domitian died in 96, the
                book was therefore written between <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 93 and 95.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Author.—</hi>Before entering on the Chief data which help towards
                the determination of this question, we shall first state the author’s standpoint.
                His book exhibits a Christianity that is—as Harnack <hi rend="italic">(Ency.
                    BritJ,</hi> xx. 498) writes—" free from the law, free from national prejudices,
                universal and yet a Christianity which is independent of Paul. . . . The author
                speaks not at all of the law@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>—the word does not occur in his
                work; he looks for salvation from the power and grace of God and Christ alone . . .
                nowhere has he made a distinction between Gentile and Jewish Christians. . . . The
                author of the Apocalypse has cast aside all national religious prejudices.” The
                writer-is not dependent, consciously or unconsciously, on the Pauline teaching. He
                has won his way to Universalism, not through the Pauline method, but through one of
                his own. He has no serious preference for the people of Israel as such, but only for
                the martyrs and confessors, who shall belong to every tribe and tongue and people
                and nation (vii. 9 seq.). The unbelieving Jews are " a synagogue of Satan ” (ii.
                9).</p>
            <p>Yet, on the other hand, our author’s attitude to the world reflects the temper of
                Judaism rather than that of Christianity. He looks upon the enemies of the Christian
                Church with unconcealed hatred. No prayer arises within his work on their behalf,
                and nothing but unalloyed triumph is displayed over their doom. The Christian duty
                of love to those that wrong us does not seem to have impressed itself on
                our Apocalyptist.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Is the Apocalypse pseudonymous?—</hi>All the Jewish apocalypses are
                pseudonymous, and all the Christian with the exception of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shepherd of Hermas.</hi> Since our book undoubtedly belongs to this category,
                the question of its pseudonymity must arise. In the articles on Apocalyptic
                Literature and Apocryphal Literature <hi rend="italic">(qq.v.)</hi> we have shown
                the large lines of differentiation between apocalyptic and prophecy. The chief
                ground for resorting to pseudonymous authorship in Judaism was that the belief in
                prophecy was lost among the people. Hence any writer who would appeal to them was
                obliged to do so in the name of some great figure of the past. Furthermore, this
                belief that prophecy had ceased led the religious personalities of the later time to
                authenticate their message by means of antedated prophecy. They procured confidence
                in their actual predictions by appealing to the literal fulfilment of such antedated
                prophecy. In such literature we find the characteristic words or their equivalents;
                " Seal up the prophecy: it is not for this generation,” which are designed to
                explain the late appearance of the works in which they are found, But this universal
                characteristic of apocalyptic is almost wholly lacking in the New Testament
                Apocalypse. The <hi rend="italic">Vaticinium ex eventu</hi> plays but a very</p>
            <p>small part in it. Moreover, the chief ground for the development of a pseudonymous
                literature was absent in the early Christian church. For with the advent of
                Christianity prophecy had sprung anew into life, and our author distinctly declares
                that * the words of thc book are for his own generation (xxii. 10). Hence we
                conclude that thc grounds are lacking which would entitle our assuming a priori that
                tbe Apocalypse is pseudonymous.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">W as the Author the Son of Zebedee, the Apostle?—</hi>The evidence
                of the book is against this assumption. The writer demands a hearing as a prophet
                (xxii. 6), and in no single passage makes any claim to having been an apostle. Nay
                more, the evidence of the text, so far as it goes, is against such a view. He
                never refers to any previous intercourse with Christ such as we find frequently in
                the Fourth Gospel, and when he speaks of " the twelve apostles of the Lamb ” (xxi.
                14) he does so in a tone that would seem to exclude him from that body. Here
                internal and external evidence are at strife; for from the time of Justin pnwards
                the Apocalypse was received by the church as the work of the Apostle John (see
                Swete, <hi rend="italic">op. citJ,</hi> p. clxxv). If the writer of the Fourth
                Gospel was the Apostle John, then thc difficulties for the assumption of an
                apostolic authorship of the Apocalypse become well-nigh insuperable. Nay more, the
                difficulties attending on the assumption of a common authorship of the Gospel and
                Apocalypse, independently of tbe question of thc apostolic authorship of the Gospel,
                are practically insuperable. Some decades ago these difficulties were not
                insurmountable, when critics assigned a Neronic date to the Apocalypse and
                a Domitianic or later date to the Gospel. It was from such a standpoint conceivable
                that the thoughts and diction of thc writer had undergone an entire transformation
                in the long interval that intervened between the composition of tbe two books, on
                the supposition that both were from the same hand. But now that both books are
                assigned to the last decade of the ist century a.d. by a growing body of critics,
                the hypothesis of a common authorship can hardly be sustained. The validity of such
                an hypothesis was attacked as early as the 4th century by Dionysius of Alexandria in
                the fragment of his treatise rept €7ταγγ€λώρ, in Eusebius, <hi rend="italic"
                    >H.E.</hi> vii. 24 seq. His arguments, as summed up by Swete <hi rend="italic"
                    >(op. cit.,</hi> p. cxiv seq.), arc as follows:</p>
            <p>" John the Evangelist abstains from mentioning his own name, but John the
                Apocalyptist names himself more than once at the very outset of his book, and again
                near its end. Doubtless there were many who bore the name of John in the early
                Christian communities; we read, for instance, of 'John, whose surname was Mark,’ and
                there may have been a second John in Asia, since at Ephesus, we are told, there were
                two tombs said to be John’s.</p>
            <p>. . . Again, while the Gospel and the Epistle of John show marks of agreement which
                suggest a common authorship, the Apocalypse differs widely from both in its ideas
                and in its way of expressing them; we miss in it the frequent references to ' life,’
                ' light,’</p>
            <p><hi rend="sup">4</hi> truth,’<hi rend="sup">4</hi> grace ’ and 'love ’ which arc
                characteristic of thc Apostle and find ourselves in a totally different region of
                thought. . . . Lastly, the linguistic eccentricities of the Apocalypse bar the way
                against the acceptance of the book as the work of the Evangelist. The Gospel and the
                First Epistle are written in correct and flowing Greek, and there is not a
                barbarism, a solecism, or a provincialism in them; whereas thc Greek of thc
                Apocalypse is inaccurate, disfigured by unusual or foreign words and even at times
                by solecisms.”</p>
            <p>AU subsequent criticism has more or less confirmed the conclusions of Dionysius. On
                the other hand, it is impossible to ignore thc signs of a relationship between the
                Apocalypse and the Gospel in the minor peculiarities of language.@@<hi rend="sup"
                    >2</hi> These, Swete holds, " create a strong presumption of affinity ”
                between the two books, while Boussct infers that they" justify the assumption that
                thc entire circle of Johannine writings spring from circles which stood under the
                influence of the John of Asia Minor.”</p>
            <p>We conclude, therefore, that the Gospel and thc Apocalypse</p>

                univer-salism. He lays no further burden on his readers than those required by the
