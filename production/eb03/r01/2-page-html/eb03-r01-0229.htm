<p><span class="font2">marlcabfy dry till the latter part </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">oſ harveſt, when </span><span class="font2">there fell a conſiderable, though by no means unuſual, quan-tity of rain. Towards the end of December a ſevere&nbsp;froſt bound up the whole of the rivers and lakes of&nbsp;Holland. The waal was frozen over in the beginning&nbsp;of January; </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">circumſtance which had not occurred for&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">14 </span><span class="font2">years paſt. Taking advantage ef this, the French&nbsp;croſſed that river, and with little oppoſition ſeized the&nbsp;important pafs of Bommell, which at other ſcafons is&nbsp;ſo ſtrong by its inundations. The allied army had been&nbsp;joined by 17,000 Auſtrians, and had received ordcrs to&nbsp;defend Holland to the laſt. They did fo, and were&nbsp;ſuccefsſul in repulſing the French for ſome days between&nbsp;the waal and the Leck ; but the republican army,&nbsp;amounting to 70,000 men, having at laſt advanced in full&nbsp;force, the allied troops were compelied to retire acroſs&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the </span><span class="font2">Yſſel into weſtphalia^ In the courſe of their march&nbsp;throughthis deſert country, in the midſt of ſevere froſt&nbsp;and a deep ſuow, they arc ſaid to have ſuſſered incredible hardſhips, and to have loſt a very great number of&nbsp;men. The French, in the mean time, advanced rapidly&nbsp;acrofs the country to the Zuyder fea, to prevent the in-habitants ſrom flying, and carrying oſſ their property.&nbsp;On the 16th of January 1795, a party of horſe, without&nbsp;jreflſtance, took poſſeffion of Amſterdam. The other&nbsp;towns furrendered at diſcretion. In confeqnence of an.&nbsp;order from the States General, the ſlrong ſortreſſes of&nbsp;Bergen-op-zoon, wiliiamftadt, Breda, &amp;c. opened their&nbsp;gates to the French. The fleet and the ſhipping were&nbsp;fixed by the intenſe froſt in their Rations, and fell a prey&nbsp;to the enemy; who thus, with little effort, made a complete conqueſt of this populous and once powerful country. The French were well received by the people at&nbsp;large. The power of the Stadtholder had been ſupport-ed among them merely by the influence of Pruffia and&nbsp;England. Through hatred to this officc, which had&nbsp;now become odious chiefly to the mercantile ariſtocracy&nbsp;of Holland, they were little attached to their allies, and&nbsp;gave them, during the preſent war, as little ſupport as&nbsp;poſſible. The Stadtholder and his family now fled to&nbsp;England. Tlie French declared, that they did not&nbsp;mean to make ſubjects but allies of the Dutch, and invited them to call together popular aſſemblies for ſettling&nbsp;their own government, under the protection of the&nbsp;French republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thus terminated a campaign, the moſt aſtoniſhing, perhaps, that has been known in the hiſtory of mankind.&nbsp;In the courſe cf it, even before the conqueſt of Holland, the French had taken 2000 pieces of cannon and&nbsp;60,000 priſoners. Aſter that event, the conquered ter-ritories added to them a population of nearly 14 millions&nbsp;of people. Luxembourg and Mentz were the only&nbsp;places on this ſide of the Rhine that reſiſted them. The&nbsp;former was cloftly blockaded, for the purpoſe of compelling it to ſurrender the latter was ſeveral times aſ-faulted,, but ſucceſsfully held out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Europe was now weary of this bloody ſtrife. The German Diet of Ratiſhon declared its reſolution to&nbsp;take meafures for procuring peace. Tile Grand Duke&nbsp;of Tuſcany concluded a treaty with thc French republic. France itſelſ, exhauſted by maſſacrea, emigrations,&nbsp;and the terrible efforts which it had made, wiſhed for&nbsp;tranquillity ; and the Convention found it neceſſary to&nbsp;declare that they were willing to treat for peace with&nbsp;any of the powers of Europe, upon honourable terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The frequent changes, however, which have with aſtoniſhing rapidity taken place in the mode oſ conduct-ing French affairs, and the different principles diſplay-ed by the different factions as they ſucceffively got into&nbsp;power, have produced in Great Britain and Auſtria a&nbsp;very general perſuaſion that no peace concluded with the&nbsp;preſent Convention could either be honourable or per-manent ; and therefore theſe two mighty nations have&nbsp;reſolved to continue the war with redoubled vigour.—&nbsp;In ſupport oſ the wiſdom oſ this reſolutſon, it has been&nbsp;obſerved, that the hatred oſ the Mountain to the Gi-rondiſts was Inch, that it would have violated any treaty which had been concluded with thAa ; that when&nbsp;Robeſpierre beoame all powerful, and terror was the&nbsp;order oſ the day, all former meaſures were changed,&nbsp;and peace or war made wholly ſubſervient to the ambitious views of that relentteſa tyrant ; that Taliien, having orig'nally belonged to the Mountain, introduced&nbsp;the preſent ſyſtem of moderation, not from principle,&nbsp;but only to reconcile the people to his uſurped authority, and the faſt of his bloody predeceſſor ; that he&nbsp;may ſuddenly change his meaſures, or be denounced and&nbsp;executed hy the influence of ſome more daring demagogue, who would again introduce the fyſtem of terror;&nbsp;and that in ſuch a ſtate of uncertainty, the only confe-qnence to be expected from making peace at preſent is,&nbsp;that it would furniſh the next faction which may gain,&nbsp;the aſeendancy in France with an opportunity of attacking the allies when leſs prepared to receive them..&nbsp;Such reafoning as this has been admitted in the Britiih.&nbsp;parliament, where a loan of ſix millions Sterling has.&nbsp;been voted to the Emperor, to enable him to begin the&nbsp;enſuing campaign with an army of 2-00,000 men. In&nbsp;what manner the war ought to be conducted, it is not&nbsp;for ns to ſay. The Britiſh nation feems to reſt its hopes&nbsp;on its ſuperiority at ſea ; and the greateſt exertions are&nbsp;making to augment and man the navy. But we are&nbsp;here under the neceffity of dropping this ſubject, with-out being able completely to fulfil the promiſe which&nbsp;we made to our readers at the end of the article&nbsp;France, There is as little appearance at preſent of&nbsp;peace, and a ſteady government being foon reſtored to&nbsp;that diſtracted eountry, as there was at the beginning&nbsp;of the troubles ; and there is not the ſmalleſt probab;-lity that the republican conſtitution, framed by the&nbsp;Convention, will laſt one year after the diſſolution of&nbsp;that aſſembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In tracing the origin and progrefs of this wonderful revolution, we have conſulted every work from which&nbsp;we had reaſon to look ſor information, aad we have&nbsp;confined ourſelves to </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">ſimple narration of facts, ſeldom&nbsp;giving way to the reflections which they ſuggeſted. Our&nbsp;facts, too, have been generally ſtated from writers who&nbsp;are ſuppoſed to be not unfriendly to democracy, that&nbsp;they may gain the fuller credit with our own reformers ;&nbsp;lor in the moſt favourable point of view in which thoſe&nbsp;facts can be placed, they furniſh the ſtrongeſt objection&nbsp;poffible to all their propoſed reformations of the Britiſh&nbsp;conſtitution. If the horrible deeds of darknefs which&nbsp;have been acted on the theatre of France cannot make&nbsp;us contented with the government under which we live,&nbsp;and which has been brought to its preſent ſtate of perfection, not by the metaphyſical ſpeculations of recluſe&nbsp;philofophers, but by obfervation and the practical experience of ages, wc ſhall </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">be confidered </span><span class="font2">by poſterity as </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
