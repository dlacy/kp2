Pretty pottery is made&nbsp;at Jhajjar, and cotton cloth for home use is woven in large quantities. The gross revenue of the district in 1883-84 was £78,346,&nbsp;of which £65,440 was derived from the land-tax.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rohtak was formerly included within the region known as Hariana, which in 1718 was granted by the emperor Faroksher to&nbsp;his minister Rukhau-ad-Daula, who in his turn made over the&nbsp;greater part of it to a Baluch noble, Faujdar Khan, afterwards&nbsp;created nawab of Farakhnagar. The district, together with the&nbsp;other possessions of Scindia west of the Jumna, passed to the East&nbsp;India Company in 1803. Until 1832 Rohtak was under the administration of a political agent, resident at Delhi, but in that year&nbsp;it was brought under the general regulations and annexed to the&nbsp;North-Western Provinces. The outbreak of the mutiny in 1857 led&nbsp;to the abandonment, for a time, of the district by the British,&nbsp;when the mutineers attacked and plundered the civil station of&nbsp;Rohtak, destroying every record of administration. It was not&nbsp;until after the fall of Delhi that the authority of the British&nbsp;Government was permanently restored. The constitution of the&nbsp;present district was then taken in hand, and Rohtak was transferred to the Punjab Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROHTAK, municipal town and headquarters of the above district, lying in 28° 54' N. lat and 76° 38' E. long.,&nbsp;with a population in 1881 of 15,699 (males 8155, females&nbsp;7544). It is situated 44 miles to the north-west of Delhi&nbsp;on the road to Hissar, and, viewed from the sandhills to&nbsp;the south, forms with its white mosque in the centre and&nbsp;the fort standing out boldly to the east a striking and&nbsp;picturesque object. Rohtak is a town of great antiquity,&nbsp;but beyond the fact that it became the headquarters of a&nbsp;British district in 1824 it is of no considerable importance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">ROKITANSKY, Carl von Rokitansky, Freiherr von (1804-1878), the founder of the Vienna school of&nbsp;pathological anatomy, w<sup>τ</sup>as born in 1804 at Königgrätz in&nbsp;Bohemia. He got his schooling in his native tov<sup>τ</sup>n as well&nbsp;as at the gymnasium of Leitmeritz, after which he became&nbsp;a student of medicine at Prague. He finished his medical&nbsp;studies at Vienna, graduating there in 1828. Soon after&nbsp;he became assistant to Wagner, the professor of pathological anatomy, and succeeded him in 1834 as prosector,&nbsp;being at the same time made extraordinary professor. It&nbsp;was not until ten years later (1844) that he reached the&nbsp;rank of full professor. To his duties as a teacher he added&nbsp;in 1847 the onerous office of medico-legal anatomist to the&nbsp;city, and in 1863 an influential office in the ministry of&nbsp;education and public worship, wherein he had to advise on&nbsp;all routine matters of medical teaching, including patronage. A seat in the upper house of the reichsrath rewarded&nbsp;his public labours in 1867, and on his retirement from all&nbsp;his offices in 1874 he was made a commander of the&nbsp;Order of Leopold. He joined the Imperial Academy of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sciences as a member in 1848, and became its president in 1869. He was president also of the medical society of&nbsp;the Austrian capital and an honorary member of many&nbsp;foreign societies. On his retirement at the age of seventy&nbsp;his colleagues celebrated the occasion by a function in the&nbsp;aula of the university, where his bust was unveiled. In&nbsp;his leave-taking speech he said that work had always been&nbsp;a pleasure to him and pleasures mostly a toil. His death&nbsp;in 1878 elicited many genuine expressions of affection and&nbsp;of esteem for his upright character. Two of his sons became professors at Vienna, one of astronomy and another&nbsp;of medicine, while a third gained distinction on the lyric&nbsp;stage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With Rokitansky’s name is associated the second great period of the medical school of Vienna, its first success having been identified&nbsp;with the liberal patronage of it by Maria Theresa and with the&nbsp;fame of Van Swieten, whom the empress had attracted thither from&nbsp;Leyden. The basis of its second reputation was morbid anatomy,&nbsp;together with the precision of clinical diagnosis dependent thereon,&nbsp;and associated with the labours of Rokitansky’s lifelong friend&nbsp;Skoda. The anatomical vogue had begun under Wagner while&nbsp;Rokitansky was still a student ; but it reached its highest point&nbsp;while the latter was assistant in the dead-house and afterwards&nbsp;prosector and professor. The enthusiasm for the post-mortem study&nbsp;of disease brought one very serious consequence at the outset, in the&nbsp;enormous increase of the death-rate from puerperal fever in the lying-in wards of the general hospital. A comparison between the slight&nbsp;mortality in the wards that were afterwards reserved for the training of midwives and the excessive mortality in those set apart for&nbsp;the training of students proved that the cause was the conveyance&nbsp;of cadaveric poison from the dead-house by the hands of the latter.&nbsp;The precautions introduced after 1847 succeeded in removing that&nbsp;grave reproach from the study of morbid anatomy. Another and&nbsp;more lasting consequence of the assiduous pursuit of post-mortem&nbsp;study, counterbalancing somewhat the advantage of a more precise&nbsp;and localized diagnosis, was the loss of faith in the power of drugs&nbsp;to remedy the textural changes—the so-called “nihilism” of the&nbsp;Vienna school. The immediate outcome of Rokitansky’s close&nbsp;application to the work of the dead-house was his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Handbuch der&nbsp;pathologischen Anatomie</span><span class="font1"> (1842-46), in 3 vols., of which the first&nbsp;was published last. The value of the work lies in the second and&nbsp;third volumes, containing succinct descriptions of the visible&nbsp;changes and abnormalities in the several organs and parts of the&nbsp;body. Whenever Rokitansky touched the vital problems of general&nbsp;pathology, as he did in the postponed first volume, he revealed a&nbsp;metaphysical bent, which was strong in him behind all his undoubted powers of outward observation and accurate description.&nbsp;Being a few years too soon to profit by the microscopic movement&nbsp;which led to the cellular pathology, he endeavoured to reconcile&nbsp;the old humoral doctrine with his anatomical observations, and to&nbsp;read a new meaning into the doctrine of the various dyscrasias.&nbsp;The third and last edition of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Handbuch</span><span class="font1"> was published from&nbsp;1855 to 1861. In 1862 he entered into possession of a new pathological institute, in which he found means, for the first time, to display his extensive collection of specimens in a museum. Although&nbsp;he had no direct share in the newer developments of pathology, he&nbsp;was far from indifferent or reactionary towards them ; indeed the&nbsp;laboratories and chairs for microscopic and experimental pathology&nbsp;and for pathological chemistry were warmly encouraged and aided&nbsp;by him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Next to his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Handbuch,</span><span class="font0"> of which the Syd. Soc. published an English translation in 4 vols., 1849-52, his most important writings were four memoirs in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Denkschriften</span><span class="font0"> of the Vienna Academy of Sciences (on the Anatomy of Goitre,&nbsp;Cysts, Diseases of Arteries, and Defects in the Septa of the Heart), the last as&nbsp;late as 1875. Other papers of less importance brought up the total of his&nbsp;writings to thirty-eight, including three addresses of a philosophical turn, on&nbsp;“ Freedom of Inquiry” (1862), “ The Independent Value of Knowledge ” (1867),&nbsp;and “The Solidarity of Animal Life&quot; (1869).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROLAND. Jean Marie Roland de la Platrière (1732-1793), who, along with his wife, Manon Jeanne&nbsp;Phlipon (1754-1793), played a prominent part in the history of the French Revolution, in connexion chiefly -with&nbsp;the policy and fortunes of the Girondists, was born at Yille-franche near Lyons in 1732. He received a good education, and early formed the studious habits which remained&nbsp;with him through life. Proposing to seek his fortune&nbsp;abroad, he went on foot to Nantes, but was there prostrated by an illness so severe that all thoughts of emigration were perforce abandoned. For some years he was&nbsp;employed as a clerk ; thereafter he joined a relative who&nbsp;was inspector of manufactures at Amiens, and he himself&nbsp;speedily rose to the position of inspector.
