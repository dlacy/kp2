He therefore employed himself in the investigation of the manner in which the acknowledged powers of natural bodies, acting according to the received laws of mechanics, could produce and preserve these vortices, and restore that motion which was expended in carrying the planets round the sun. In the second book of the Principles of Natural Philosophy, he gives a series of beautiful propositions, viz. 51, 52, &amp;c. with their corollaries, showing how <hi rend="italic">the</hi>  rotation of a cylinder or sphere round its axis in the midst of a fluid will excite a vortical motion in this fluid ; and he ascertains with mathematical precision the motion of every filament of this vortex.</p><p>He sets out from the supposition that this motion is excited in the surrounding stratum of fluid in consequence of a want of perfect lubricity, and assumes as an hypothesis, that the initial resistance (or diminution of the motion of the cylinder) which arises from this want of lubricity, is proportional to the velocity with which the surface of the cylinder is separated from the contiguous surface of the surrounding fluid, and that the whole resistance is proportional to the velocity with which the parts of the fluid are mutually separated from each other. From this, and the equality of action and re-action, it evidently follows, that the velocity of any stratum of the vortex is the arithmetical medium between the velocities of the strata immediately within and without it. For the intermediate stratum cannot be in equilibrio, unless it is as much pressed forward by the superior motion of the stratum within it, as it is <hi rend="italic">kept</hi>  back by the slower motion of the stratum without it.</p><p>This beautiful investigation applies in the most perfect manner to every change produced in the motion of a fluid filament, in consequence <hi rend="italic">of</hi>  the viscidity and friction of the adjoining filaments ; and a filament proceeding along <hi rend="italic">a tube </hi>at some small distance from the sides has, in like manner, a velocity which is the medium between those of the filaments immediately surrounding it. <hi rend="italic">It</hi>  is therefore a problem of no very difficult solution to assign the law by which the velocity will gradually diminish as the filament recedes from the axis of a cylindrical tube. It is somewhat surprising that so neat a problem has never occupied the attention of the mathematicians during the time that these subjects were so assiduously studied ; but so it is, that nothing precise has been published on the subject. The only approach to a discussion of this kind, is a Memoir of Mr Pitot, read to the academy of Paris in 1726, where he considers the velocity of efflux though a pipe. Here, by attending to the comparative superiority of the <hi rend="italic">quantity of motion</hi>  in large pipes, he affirms, that the total diminutions arising from friction will be <hi rend="italic">(cœteris paribus)</hi>  in the inverse ratio of the diameters. This was thankfully received by other writers, and is now a part of our hydraulic theories.</p><p>It has not, however, been attended to by those who write on the motion of rivers, though it is evident that it is applicable to these with equal propriety ; and had it been introduced, it would at once have solved all their difficulties, and particularly would have shown how an almost imperceptible declivity would produce the gentle motion of a great river, without having recourse to the unintelligible principle of Guglielmini.</p><p>Mr Couplet made some experiments on the motion of the water in the great main pipes of Versailles, in order to obtain some notions of the retardations occasioned by friction. They were found prodigious ; but were so irregular, and unsusceptible of reduction to any general principle (and the experiments were indeed so few that they were unfit for this reduction), that he could establish no theory. What</p><p>Mr Belidor established on them, and makes a sort of system to direct future engineers, is quite unworthy of attention.</p><p>Upon the whole, this branch of hydraulics, although of much greater practical importance than the conduct of water in pipes, has never yet obtained more than a vague, and, we may call it, slovenly attention from the mathematicians ; and we ascribe it to their not having taken the pains to settle its first principles with the same precision as had been done in the other branch. They were, from the beginning, satisfied with a sort of applicability of mathematical principles, without ever making the application. Were it not that some would accuse us of national partiality, we would ascribe it to this, that Newton had not pointed out the way in this as in the other branch ; for any intelligent reader of the performances on the motions of fluids in close vessels, will see that not a principle, nay hardly a step of investigation, has been added to those which were used or pointed out by Sir Isaac Newton. He has nowhere touched this question, the motion of water in an open canal.</p><p>In his theories of the tides, and of the propagation of waves, he had an excellent opportunity for giving at once <hi rend="italic">the</hi>  fundamental principles of motion in a free fluid whose surface was not horizontal. But, by means of some of those happy and shrewd guesses, in which, as Daniel Bernoulli says, he excelled all men, he saw the undoubted consequences of some palpable phenomenon which would answer all his present purposes, and therefore entered no farther into the investigation.</p><p>The original theory of Guglielmini, or the principle adopted by him, that each particle of the vertical section of a running stream has a tendency to move as if it were issuing from an orifice at that depth under the surface, is false ; and that it really does so in the face of a dam when the floodgate is taken away, is no less so ; and if it did, the subsequent motions would hardly have any resemblance to those which he assigns them. Were this the case, the exterior form of the cascade would be something like what is sketched in fig. 3, with an abmpt angle at B, and a concave surface BEG. This will be evi</p><p>dent to every one who combines the greater velocity of the lower filaments with the slower motion of those which must slide down above thetn. But this greater advance of the lower filaments cannot take place without an expenditure of the water under the surface AB. The surface therefore sinks, and B instantly ceases to retain its place in the horizontal plane.</p><p>The water does not successively flow forward from A to B, and then tumble over the precipice ; but immediately opening the floodgate, the water wastes from the space immediately behind it, and the whole puts on the form represented in fig. 4, consisting of the curve A <hi rend="italic">b</hi>  P <hi rend="italic">c EG,</hi>  convex from A to <hi rend="italic">c,</hi>  and con</p><p>cave from thence forward. The superficial water begins to accelerate all the way from A ; and the particles may be supposed (for the present) to have</p><p>acquired the velocity corresponding to their depth under the horizontal surface. This must be understood as nothing more than a vague sketch of the motions. It requires a very critical and intricate investigation to determine either the form of the upper curve or the motions of the different filaments. The place A, where the curvature begins, is of equally difficult determination, and is various according to the differences of depth and of inclination of the succeeding canal.</p><p>We have thus given an historical sketch of the progress</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
