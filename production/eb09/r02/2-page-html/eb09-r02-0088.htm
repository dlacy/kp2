<p><span class="font1">then, are trees or shrubs, never herbs, with simple, evergreen or deciduous leaves, and flowers in terminal clusters surrounded in the bud by bud-scales but not as a rule by&nbsp;true leaves. The flowers are remarkable for the frequent&nbsp;absence or reduced condition of the calyx. The funnel- or&nbsp;bell-shaped corolla, on the other hand, with its five or&nbsp;more lobes, is usually conspicuous, and in some species so&nbsp;much so as to render these plants greatly prized in gardens.&nbsp;The free stamens are usually ten, with slender filaments&nbsp;and anthers opening by pores at the top. The ovary is&nbsp;five- or many-celled, ripening into a long woody pod which&nbsp;splits from top to bottom by a number of valves, which&nbsp;break away from the central placenta and liberate a large&nbsp;number of small bran-like seeds provided with a membranous wing-like appendage at each end. The species&nbsp;are for the most part natives of the mountainous regions&nbsp;of the northern hemisphere, extending as far south as the&nbsp;Malay Archipelago and New Guinea, but not hitherto&nbsp;found in South America or Australia. None are natives&nbsp;of Britain. They vary greatly in stature, some of the&nbsp;alpine species being mere pigmies with minute leaves and&nbsp;tiny blossoms, while some of the Himalayan species are&nbsp;moderate sized trees with superb flowers. Some are epiphytal, growing on the branches of other trees, but not&nbsp;deriving their sustenance from them. The varieties grown&nbsp;in gardens are mostly derived from the Pontic species (A.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ponticum)</span><span class="font1"> and the Virginian </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. catawbieηse.</span><span class="font1"> These are&nbsp;mostly hardy in England. The common Pontic variety is&nbsp;excellent for game-covert from its hardiness, the shelter it&nbsp;affords, and the fact that hares and rabbits rarely eat it.&nbsp;Variety of colour has been infused by crossing or hybridizing the species first-named, or their derivatives, with some&nbsp;of the more gorgeously-coloured Indian varieties. In many&nbsp;instances this has been done without sacrifice of hardihood,&nbsp;but even where the infusion of Indian blood has brought&nbsp;about a tenderness of constitution the magnificence of the&nbsp;bloom amply repays the very slight shelter which is requisite in winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What are termed greenhouse rhododendrons are derivatives from certain Malayan and Javanese species, and are consequently much&nbsp;more tender. They are characterized by the possession of a&nbsp;cylindrical (not funnel-shaped) flower-tube and other marks of distinction. Azaleas now referred to Rhododendron are derived from&nbsp;Chinese and Japanese species chiefly. The “ Indian ” azaleas, so-called, have nearly evergreen foliage like a rhododendron, but&nbsp;with stiff hairs on the under surface of the leaf, and the flower-buds&nbsp;comprise leaves and not bud-scales only as in true rhododendrons.&nbsp;Rhododendron (Azalea) indicum is truly a native of China and&nbsp;Japan, but not of India. What are called in gardens Ghent azaleas&nbsp;are hardy varieties with deciduous gummy foliage and tufts of&nbsp;fragrant, brilliantly-coloured flowers. These are derivatives from&nbsp;A. calendulacea, A. viseosa, and other north-east American species.&nbsp;Another group of garden azaleas are derivatives from Rhododendron&nbsp;(Azalea) sinense (of which A. mollis is a form). These are scarcely&nbsp;less hardy than the preceding. Azalea amœna of gardens is a&nbsp;dwarf form of R. indicum, remarkable for having “ hose in hose ”&nbsp;flowers, a state of things brought about by the fact that the calyx&nbsp;in this variety becomes petaloid like the corolla. The foliage of&nbsp;rhododendrons contains much tannin, and has been used medicinally. Whether the honey mentioned by Xenophon as poisonous&nbsp;was really derived from plants of this genus as alleged is still an&nbsp;open question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHONE (Fr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhone),</span><span class="font1"> the largest European river flowing directly into the Mediterranean, rises in the Swiss canton of Valais, passes through the Lake of Geneva, strikes&nbsp;across the line of the Jura, and turning southward through&nbsp;France falls into the Gulf of Lyons. It has a length of&nbsp;447 miles according to Strelbitzky (505 according to other&nbsp;authorities), and its principal affluent the Saône has a&nbsp;length of 268 miles above the confluence, which is 200&nbsp;miles inland. The drainage area of the whole river-system is 38,000 square miles, and the mean discharge at&nbsp;the river mouth is 60,000 cubic feet per second, the maximum being 428,840 cubic feet and the minimum 19,426.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The natives give the name of source of the Rhone (locally Rotten or Rodden) to three warm springs that rise in a&nbsp;circular stone basin near the Hôtel du Glacier du Rhône ;&nbsp;but the real beginning of the river is the well-known&nbsp;glacier. According to M. Gosset,</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> a Swiss engineer, the&nbsp;Rhone glacier, which at present measures about 9 miles&nbsp;in length by about 3200 feet in width, is proved to have&nbsp;retreated 3028 feet between 1856 and 1881 and sunk&nbsp;upwards of 300 feet. In geological time the Rhone glacier&nbsp;filled the whole valley to a depth of 4800 feet and&nbsp;spread out over the Swiss plain now partly occupied by&nbsp;the Lake of Geneva. Obstructed by the Jura, it divided&nbsp;into two branches, one of which found its way (as the&nbsp;river does still) by the “ écluse ” between the Jura and&nbsp;the western Alps to deposit its erratic blocks on the&nbsp;heights in the neighbourhood of Lyons, while the other&nbsp;branch, bending northward, widened out so as to distribute&nbsp;its burden at Freiburg, Bern, Soleure, and even Aarburg.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the first 30 miles from the foot of the glacier (5751 feet) to Brieg (2214 feet) the stream has a fall of 1 in&nbsp;46 ; in the next 70 miles to Villeneuve it descends at the&nbsp;rate of 1 in 378.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> It passes between the Bernese and the&nbsp;Pennine Alps, receiving the tribute of 260 glaciers, of which&nbsp;the Aletsch is one of the most important. At Martigny,&nbsp;where it is joined by the Drance (a glacier-fed stream&nbsp;memorable for the terrible inundation of 1818 caused by&nbsp;the sudden bursting of the ice barrier by which its waters&nbsp;had been dammed back), the Rhone turns suddenly northwest, and below the defile of St Maurice (about 90 miles&nbsp;from its source) it enters the wide alluvial plain formerly&nbsp;occupied by the south-eastern arm of the Lake of Geneva&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font1"> which has now retreated about 12 miles northward.&nbsp;The limpid character of the Rhone water as it issues from&nbsp;the south-western end of this great settling vat has become&nbsp;a commonplace of geographical illustration, and equally&nbsp;well-known is the contrast afforded at the confluence&nbsp;about a mile below Geneva between the current of the&nbsp;main river and that of its turbulent affluent the Arve,&nbsp;which has found no resting place in its 2000 feet descent&nbsp;by a course of 60 miles from the valley of Chamouni and&nbsp;the glaciers of Mont Blanc. It is the Arve that is&nbsp;mainly responsible for the dangerous inundations of the&nbsp;Rhone valley farther down ; while its volume is sometimes&nbsp;not more than 1235 per second,</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> at other times it pours into&nbsp;the Rhone (whose maximum at this point is 2000 cubic&nbsp;feet) no less than 24,700 cubic feet, sometimes causing the&nbsp;river to flow backwards towards the Lake of Geneva.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> To&nbsp;obviate the evils of their irregularity it has been proposed&nbsp;to divert the lower course of the Arve into the Lake of&nbsp;Geneva. The annual maximum of the Rhone at Geneva,&nbsp;according to observations between 1806 and 1880, occurs&nbsp;on the 7th of August. Since 1862 there has been an&nbsp;increase of high levels owing to the dyking of the river&nbsp;and the destruction of forests (see Plantamour, “ Obs.&nbsp;limniinétriques,” in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mém. de la Soc. de Genève,</span><span class="font1"> 1880).&nbsp;The defile or “écluse” by which the Rhone passes&nbsp;between Grand Credo, the terminal bastion of the Jura,&nbsp;and Mont Vouache, one of the Alps of Savoy, is commanded by one of the great frontier fortresses of France,</span></p>
