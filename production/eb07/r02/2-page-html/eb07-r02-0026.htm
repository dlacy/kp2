<p><span class="font1">ents. But had they retained them for ages, the sentient ' inhabitants of the earth, or at least the nobler animals, with&nbsp;man at their head, would not thence have derived much advantage. The general laws of nature produce changes in&nbsp;our atmosphere which must ever render these great elevations unfruitful. That genial warmth, which is equally necessary for the useful plant as for the animal which lives on&nbsp;it, is confined to the lower grounds. The earth, which on&nbsp;the top of Mount Hæmus could only bring forth moss and&nbsp;dittany, when brought into the gardens of Spalatro produced pot-herbs so luxuriant, that Diocletian told his colleague Maximian that he had more pleasure in their cultivation than the Roman empire could confer. Thus nature&nbsp;not only provides us manure, but conveys it to our fields.&nbsp;She even keeps it safe in store for us till it shall be wanted. The tracts of country which are but newly inhabited&nbsp;by man, such as great part of America, and the newly-dis-covered regions of Terra Australis, are still almost occupied&nbsp;by marshes and lakes, or covered with impenetrable forests ;&nbsp;and they would remain long enough in this state, if population, continually increasing, did not increase industry, and&nbsp;multiply the hands of cultivators along with their necessities. The Author of Nature was alone able to form the&nbsp;huge ridges of the mountains, to model the hillocks and&nbsp;the valleys, to mark out the courses of the great rivers, and&nbsp;give the first trace to every rivulet ; but has left to man&nbsp;the task of draining his own habitation and the fields which&nbsp;are to support him, because this is a task not beyond his&nbsp;powers. It was therefore of immense advantage to him that&nbsp;those parts of the globe into which he has not yet penetrated should remain covered with lakes, marshes, and forests,&nbsp;which keep in store the juice of the earth, which the influence of the air and the vivifying warmth of the sun&nbsp;would have expended long ere now in useless vegetation,&nbsp;and which the rains of heaven would have swept into the&nbsp;sea, had they not been thus protected by their situation or&nbsp;their cover. It is therefore the business of man to open up&nbsp;these mines of hoarded wealth, and to thank the Author of&nbsp;all good, w<sup>,</sup>ho has thus husbanded them for his use, and left&nbsp;them as a rightful heritage for those of after days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The earth had not in the remote ages, as in our day, those great canals, those capacious voiders, always ready to&nbsp;drain off the rain-waters (of which only part is absorbed by&nbsp;the thirsty ground) and the pure waters of the springs&nbsp;from the foot of the hills. The rivers did not then exist,&nbsp;or were only torrents, whose waters, confined by the gulleys&nbsp;and glens, are searching for a place to escape. Hence arise&nbsp;those numerous lakes in the interior of great continents, of&nbsp;which there are still remarkable relics in North America,&nbsp;which in process of time will disappear, and become champaign countries. The most remote from the sea, unable to&nbsp;contain its waters, finds an issue through some gorge of the&nbsp;hills, and pours over its superfluous waters into a lower&nbsp;basin, which, in its turn, discharges its contents into another, and the last of the chain delivers its waters by a river&nbsp;into the ocean. The communication was originally begun&nbsp;by a simple overflowing at the lowest part of the margin.&nbsp;This made a torrent, which quickly deepened its bed ; and&nbsp;this circumstance increasing its velocity, as we have seen,&nbsp;would extend this deepening backward to the lake, and&nbsp;draw off more of its waters. The work would go on rapidly at first, while earth and small stones only resisted the labours of nature ; but these being washed away, and the&nbsp;channel hollowed out to the firm rock on all sides, the operation must go on very slowly, till the immense cascade&nbsp;shall undermine what it cannot break off, and then a new&nbsp;discharge will commence, and a quantity of flat ground will&nbsp;emerge all round the lake. The torrent, in the mean timc,&nbsp;makes its way down the country, and digs a canal, which&nbsp;may be called the first sketch of a river, which will deepen&nbsp;and widen its bed continually. The water of several basins</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">united, and running together in a great body, will, according to the principles which we have established, have a much greater velocity, with the same slope, than those of the&nbsp;lakes in the interior parts of the continent ; and the sum of&nbsp;them all united in the basin next the sea, after having&nbsp;broken through its natural mound, will make a prodigious&nbsp;torrent, which will dig for itself a bed so much the deepcr&nbsp;as it has more slope and a greater body of waters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The formation of the first valleys, by cutting open many springs which were formerly concealed under ground, will&nbsp;add to the mass of running waters, and contribute to drain&nbsp;off the waters of these basins. In course of time many of&nbsp;them will disappear, and flat valleys among the mountains&nbsp;and hills are the traces of their former existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When nature thus traces out the courses of future rivers, it is to be expected that those streams will most deepen&nbsp;their channels which in their approach to the sea receive&nbsp;into their bed the greatest quantities of rain and spring-waters, and that towards the middle of the continent they&nbsp;will deepen their channels less. In these last situations&nbsp;the natural slope of the fields causes the rain-water, rills,&nbsp;and the little rivulets from the springs, to seek their ways&nbsp;to the rivers. The ground can sink only by the flattening&nbsp;of the hills and high grounds ; and this must proceed with&nbsp;extreme slowness, because it is only the gentle though incessant work of the rains and springs. But the rivers, increasing in bulk and strength, and of necessity flowing over&nbsp;every thing, form to themselves capacious beds in a more&nbsp;yielding soil, and dig them even to the level of the ocean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The beds of rivers by no means form themselves in one inclined plane. If we should suppose a canal AB (fig. 14)&nbsp;perfectly straight and horizontal at</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">B, where it joins with the sea, this</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">canal would really be an inclined</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">channel of greater and greater slope</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">as it is farther from B. This is evi</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">dent ; because gravity is directed to</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">wards the centre of the earth, and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">angle CAB contained between the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">channel and the plumb-line at A is</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">smaller than the similar angle CDB ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">and consequently the inclination to the horizon is greater in A than in D. Such a canal, therefore, would make the bed of a river ; and some have thought that this was&nbsp;the real form of nature’s work ; but the supposition is a&nbsp;whim, and it is false. No river has a slope at all approaching to this. It would be eight inches declivity in the&nbsp;mile next the ocean, twenty-four inches in the second&nbsp;mile, forty inches in the third, and so on in the duplicate&nbsp;ratio (for the whole elevation) of the distances from the&nbsp;sea. Such a river would quickly tear up its bed in the&nbsp;mountains (were there any grounds high enough to receive&nbsp;it), and, except its first cascade, would soon acquire a more&nbsp;gentle slope. But tile fact is, and it is the result of the imprescriptible laws of nature, that the continued track of a&nbsp;river is a succession of inclined channels, whose slope diminishes by steps as the river approaches to the sea. It is&nbsp;not enough to say that this results from the natural slope&nbsp;of the countries through which it flows, which we observe&nbsp;to increase in declivity as we go to the interior parts of the&nbsp;continent. Were it otherwise, the equilibrium at which&nbsp;nature aims in all her operations would still produce the&nbsp;gradual diminution of the slope of rivers. Without it they&nbsp;could not be in a permanent train.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That we may more easily form a notion of the manner in which the permanent course of a river is established, let us&nbsp;suppose a stream or rivulet s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> (fig. 15) far up the country,&nbsp;makes its way through a soil perfectly uniform to the sea,&nbsp;taking the course </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">s abed ef</span><span class="font1"> and receiving the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">permanent&nbsp;additions</span><span class="font1"> of the stream </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">g a, h</span><span class="font1"> ⅛, t </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c, hd,l e,</span><span class="font1"> and that its velocity and slope in all its parts are so suited to the tenacity</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
