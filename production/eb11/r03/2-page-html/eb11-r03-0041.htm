<p><span class="font0">engages the nose of the trigger sear when the weapon is loaded (a groove in the tongue, called the &quot; half-bent ” (Z), serves as a half-cock arrangement, and could be used as a safety-catch if the&nbsp;proper safety-catch were damaged). The trigger sear (K) is a&nbsp;bell-crank lever, the upper long arm of which is put in and out of&nbsp;contact with the “ full-bent,” and the lower or short arm is connected&nbsp;to the trigger. The magazine holds ten cartridges, which rest on a&nbsp;platform, underneath which is the magazine spring that pushes the&nbsp;platform and cartridges up. A “ cut-off ” is fitted in the “ long &quot;&nbsp;and in some marks of the “ short ” rifle. This is a sort of lid to the&nbsp;magazine, enabling the magazine to be kept full while the rifle is&nbsp;being used as a single loader. But the present musketry regulations forbid single-loading, and the cut-off is now only closed for&nbsp;special. purposes, such as unloading a single cartridge (miss-fire,&nbsp;&amp;c.) without unloading the magazine. The magazine is loaded by     </span></p>
<p><span class="font0">inserting a charger in the “ charger guides ” (these, attached to the body, form a sort of bridge over the bolt) and forcing down the&nbsp;strip of cartridges into the magazine (charger guides not shown&nbsp;in diagrams). The action of the mechanism is as follows:&nbsp;Suppose that the rifle has been fired and the magazine is full. On&nbsp;beginning to turn up the knob of the bolt, the latter is revolved,&nbsp;but the cocking-piece (the tongue being held by a groove in the body)&nbsp;and the bolt-head remain stationary. Soon, however, a cam on</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">te bolt comes in contact with a stud on the cocking-piece and the latter is brought slightly to the rear, pulling in the point of the&nbsp;striker and partly compressing the spring. At the same time the&nbsp;lug on the left of the bolt, in contact with the front face of a recess&nbsp;in the body (both being cut slantwise to a screw pitch), forces the&nbsp;bolt and with it the claw of the extractor, which grips the base of&nbsp;the cartridge-case, to slide backwards. a little. As the bolt continues to turn the rib on the right of it comes up clear of the body&nbsp;and the whole bolt, with the bolt-head, can thus be drawn back&nbsp;until the bolt-head comes against the resisting shoulder on the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">right of the body and the extractor attached to it flings out the fired cartridge-case. Another cartridge then comes up from the&nbsp;magazine and lies in front of the bolt-head ready to be pushed home.&nbsp;At this moment (the beginning of loading) the stud on the cocking-piece has fallen into one of the grooves on the bolt, and as the bolt&nbsp;is pushed, forward the tongue or full-bent comes against the nose&nbsp;of the trigger sear and is held there, while the rest of the bolt&nbsp;mechanism goes on. Thus between the moving bolt and the fixed&nbsp;cocking-piece the striker spring is further compressed, and when the&nbsp;sloping faces of the bolt lugs and ribs engage the resisting portions&nbsp;of the body a last forward push is given to the bolt and the spring&nbsp;is completely compressed, ready to propel the striker forward when&nbsp;the full-bent is released from the nose of the sear. Figs. 5-8 of the&nbsp;older pattern rifle show the working of the breech mechanism.&nbsp;Instead of the older single pull-off of the trigger the “short” rifle,&nbsp;like many Continental weapons, has a double pull-off.&nbsp;This is provided for by suitably shaping the portion of&nbsp;the trigger which is in contact with tne short arm of the&nbsp;sear. The “ short ” rifle has also a somewhat different</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">pattern of safety-catch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The sights of British service rifles up to 1903 were of a very simple type, the fore-sight a “ barleycorn ” of&nbsp;triangular shape, and the back-sight a plain leaf with sliding bar into which a V was cut, the tip of the fore-sight seen&nbsp;in the middle of the V being brought on to the mark.&nbsp;In the long charger-loader this form of back-sight has been&nbsp;greatly modified, and in the “ short ” rifle it has been altogether abolished. The barleycorn fore-sight has been replaced&nbsp;in both cases by an upright blade, protected from injury by two&nbsp;ears or wings, and the V by a U aperture. For elevation the long&nbsp;rifle has still a slide on a vertical leaf, but the movement of this&nbsp;slide is controlled no longer merely by its tight fit but by a clamping&nbsp;screw. The sight of the short rifle is larger and also quite different&nbsp;in appearance and principle. There is a leaf and on it a slide, but the&nbsp;slide (controlled by clamping studs) works on a dam-shaped bed,&nbsp;its position on the leaf, affecting the point of contact with the camshaped bed, elevates the leaf to the required amount, the actual&nbsp;sighting U bein£ on the extremity of the leaf. The short rifle has&nbsp;also a  fine adjustment ” which admits of minor changes of elevation within the usual 50 yds. graduation. Both the long and the&nbsp;short rifles have “ wind-gauges,” or mechanisms for fine lateral&nbsp;adjustment of the central U sighting aperture, so as to point the&nbsp;axis of the barrel a little to the left or the right of the line of sight&nbsp;to compensate for wind, error of the individual rifle, &amp;c. In both&nbsp;rifles, on the left side of the stock, is a long-distance sight (graduated&nbsp;to 2800 yds.), which consists of an aperture sight near the bolt and&nbsp;a dial and movable pointer near the hand-guard. The short rifle&nbsp;is cased from breech to muzzle in a wooden hand-guard ; all patterns&nbsp;of long rifle have only a short wooden hand-guard just behind the&nbsp;back-sight bed. The bayonet in the long rifle is secured to the&nbsp;fore-end by a spring catch and to the barrel by a ring passing over&nbsp;the muzzle. This traditional, and still usual, arrangement has&nbsp; been abandoned in the short rifle, as the vibration of the barrel&nbsp;on discharge is more or less checked by the extra weight of the&nbsp;bayonet, and therefore the shooting of tne rifle differs according as&nbsp;it is fired with or without the bayonet fixed. With the short rifle&nbsp;the bayonet is fixed to two metal fastenings, a plug for the ring and a catch for the handle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Continental European Rifles.—</span><span class="font0">These are for the most part of the Mauser and the Männlicher types., The Mauser is a bolt weapon&nbsp;with box magazine. The bolt is simple, without separate bolt-head, and is held by two bolt-lugs at its front end engaging with&nbsp;recesses in the body (the German Mauser has an extra lug near&nbsp;the. rear end). Near the rear end there is a cam-shaped recess,&nbsp;which, engaging with a stud on the cocking-piecc, partially forces&nbsp;back the cocking-piece and spring when the bolt is revolved. When&nbsp;the bolt lever is turned up and the bolt begins to revolve, the cocking-piece and bolt plug, which together form the connexion between&nbsp;the bolt and the trigger, do not revolve, but are forced back slightly,&nbsp;so as to begin the compression of the striker spring. Then, the&nbsp;bolt lever being so shapâl as to bear against an inclined-plane edge&nbsp;on the body, the bolt comes back a little, and with it the extractor&nbsp;jaw and the empty cartridge-case. Lastly, when the bolt has turned&nbsp;through a right angle, all studs are opposite their slots and ways&nbsp;in the body, and the bolt can be drawn back. At the farthest&nbsp;rearward position of the bolt the cocking-stud on the cocking-piece.&nbsp;is well behind the nose of the trigger sear, and is thus held when the&nbsp;bolt is pushed forward again, the spring being thereby compressed.&nbsp;All Mauser rifles have a safety-catch and a double pull-off. None&nbsp;have cut-offs except the Turlash pattem. All are constructed for&nbsp;clip or charger loading, but the box magazine contains only five cartridges as against the Lee-EnfieldS ten. Mauser rifles, which are&nbsp;perhaps the strongest and least complicated of magazine arms, are&nbsp;used in the German, Belgian, Spanish, Portuguese and Turkish&nbsp;armies, and were also used by the Bocrs in the South African War.&nbsp;The type adopted by each of these nations differs from the rest in&nbsp;details only. The German rifle has a long guardless sword bayonet,&nbsp;fixed to the fore-end only and not connected with the barrel, and a&nbsp;peculiar form of back-sight, which bears some resemblance to the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
