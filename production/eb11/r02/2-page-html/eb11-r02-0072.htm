<p><span class="font2">against the dangers which are in these days threatening the same kingdom: and on that account have commanded them to bc with&nbsp;us on the Lord’s Day next after the feast of St Martin in thc approaching winter, at Westminster, to consider, ordain and do as&nbsp;may be necessary for the avoidance of these dangers: we strictly&nbsp;require you to cause two knights from the aforesaid county, two&nbsp;citizens from each city in the same county and two burgesses from&nbsp;each borough, of those who are especially discreet and capable of&nbsp;labouring, to be elected without delay, and to cause them to come&nbsp;to us at the aforesaid time and place. Moreover, thc said knights&nbsp;are to have full and sufficient power for themselves and for thc community of the aforesaid county, and the said citizens and burgesses&nbsp;for themselves and the communities of the aforesaid cities and&nbsp;boroughs separately, then and there, for doing what shall then be&nbsp;ordained according to the Common Council in the premises, so that&nbsp;the aforesaid business shall not remain unfinished in any way for&nbsp;defect of this power. And you shall have there the names of the&nbsp;knights, citizens and burgesses, and this writ.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The words “ Elegi facias,” instead of “ venire facias ” (which were retained in 1275; see Parliament), still appear to make&nbsp;the parliament of 1295 the model, rather than that of 1275, though&nbsp;in other respects the latter appears now to have established the&nbsp;summoning of county and borough representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In this summoning by the king of the two knights and two burgesses with full and sufficient power </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">for themselves and for&nbsp;the community,</span><span class="font1"> we find therefore the origin of political&nbsp;representation of the commons, as opposed to the&nbsp;actual presence and personal attendance of the peers.&nbsp;The older English national assemblies had consisted&nbsp;of the privileged class fully summoned as individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The change involved has been well explained by E. A. Freeman </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Ency. Brit.,</span><span class="font1"> 9th ed., viii. 297), when he says: “ The&nbsp;national assemblies changed their character ... by no cause&nbsp;so much as by the growth of the practice of summons. ... In&nbsp;the great assembly at Salisbury (1086), where all the land-owners of England became the men of the king (William the&nbsp;Conqueror), we see the first germs of Lords and Commons. The&nbsp;Witan are distinguished from the * land-sitting men? By the&nbsp;Witan, so called long after the Conquest, we are doubtless to&nbsp;understand those great men of the realm who were usually&nbsp;summoned to every assembly. The vast multitude who came&nbsp;to do their homage to the king were summoned only for that&nbsp;particular occasion. The personal right of summons is the&nbsp;essence of the peerage. . . . The earls and bishops of England,&nbsp;by never losing their right to the personal summons, have&nbsp;kept that right to personal attendance in the national assembly&nbsp;which was once common to all freemen, but which other freemen have lost. The House of Lords represents@@<sup>1</sup> by unbroken&nbsp;succession the Witan of the assembly of Salisbury; that is,&nbsp;it represents by unbroken succession the old assemblies of the&nbsp;Teutonic democracy. . . . The ‘land-sitting men/ on the other&nbsp;hand, not summoned personally or regularly, but summoned&nbsp;in a mass when their attendance was specially needed, gradually&nbsp;lost the right of personal attendance, till in the end they gained&nbsp;the more practical right of appearing by their representatives.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From the same authority the account of the intermediate stages in the adoption of the representative principle may be&nbsp;further quoted:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“ By the time of Henry II. the force of circumstances, especially the working of the practice of summons, had gradually changed the&nbsp;ancient assembly of the whole nation into a mere gathering of the&nbsp;great men of the realm. ... It is in the reign of Richard I. that&nbsp;wc begin to see the first faint glimmerings of parliamentary representation. . . . The object of his wise ministers, of Archbishop Hubert&nbsp;among the first, was to gain the greatest amount of money for their&nbsp;master with the least amount of oppression towards the nation.&nbsp;Under Hubert’s administration, chosen bodies of knights or other&nbsp;lawful men, acting in characters which became more and more distinctly representative, were summoned for every kind of purpose.&nbsp;How far they were nominated, how far freely elected, is not always&nbsp;clear. It seems most likely that in one stage they were nominated&nbsp;by .the sheriff in the county court, while at a later stage they were&nbsp;chosen by the county court itself. In other words, the principle of&nbsp;representation was first established, and then the next stage naturallÿ</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">was that thc representatives should be freely chosen. Summoned bodies of knights appear in characters which are thc forerunners of&nbsp;grand jurors and of justices of the peace. They appear also in a&nbsp;character which makes them &quot;distinctly forerunners of thc knights&nbsp;of the shire which were soon to come. A chosen body of knights&nbsp;have to assess the imposts on each shire. From assessing the taxes&nbsp;thc next stage was to vote or to refuse them. In 1213 the sheriffs&nbsp;are called on to summon four discreet men from each shire, to come&nbsp;and speak with the king about the affairs of the realm. When we&nbsp;have reached this stage, we have come very near to a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">parliament,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">name and thing. The reign of John, in short, is marked by common&nbsp;consent as the time from which Englishmen date the birth of their&nbsp;national freedom in its later form. . , . The (Great) Charter (1215)&nbsp;is the first solemn act of the united English nation after Norman&nbsp;conquerors and Norman settlers had become naturalized Englishmen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">. . . Representation was already fast growing up; but it had hardly yet reached such a stage that it could be ordained in legal&nbsp;form. But rules are laid down out of which, even if it had not&nbsp;begun already, TeprcsentationJn the strictest sense could not fail&nbsp;shortly to arise. The distinction which had been growing up ever&nbsp;since the Conquest, and indeed before, between the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Witan</span><span class="font2"> and the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">land-sitting men,</span><span class="font2"> now receives a legal sanction. The practice of&nbsp;summons makes the distinction. Certain great men, prelates, earls&nbsp;and greater barons, are to receive the personal summons. The rest&nbsp;of the king’s tenants-in-chief are to be summoned only in a body. Here&nbsp;we have almost come to a separation of Lords and Commons. But in&nbsp;modern ideas those names imply two distinct houses; and it was not&nbsp;yet settled, it had not yet come into men’s minds to consider, whether&nbsp;the national council should consist of one house or a dozen. But it&nbsp;is decreed in so many words that the acts of those who came would&nbsp;bind those who stayed away. On such a provision, representation,&nbsp;and not only representation but election of the representatives,&nbsp;follows almost as a matter of course. The mass stay away: a few&nbsp;appear, specially commissioned to act in the name of the rest. The&nbsp;Charter mentions only the king’s tenants-in-chief ; so far had things&nbsp;been marred or feudalized by the influence of the Conquest. But as&nbsp;the election could only be made in the ancient county court, eyery&nbsp;freeholder at least, if not every freeman, won back his ancient right.&nbsp;If he could not come himself to say Yea or Nay, he at least had a&nbsp;voice in choosing those who could do so with greater effect.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Ibid.</span><span class="font2"> pp. 307» 3.08.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“ The constitution of the (national) assembly, as defined in the Great Charter, did not absolutely imply representation; but it&nbsp;showed that the full establishment of representation could not be&nbsp;long delayed. The work of the period 1217-1340 was to call up,&nbsp;alongside of the gathering of prelates, earls and other great men&nbsp;specially summoned, into which the ancient Witanagemot had&nbsp;shrunk up, another assembly directly representing all other classes&nbsp;of the nation which enjoyed political rights. This assembly,&nbsp;chosen by various local bodies, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cmnrnunitates</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Universitates,</span><span class="font2"> having a&nbsp;quasi corporate being, came gradually to bear the name of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">commons.</span><span class="font2"> The knights of the shire, the barons, citizens and&nbsp;burgesses of the towns, were severally chosen by the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">communa </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">qt&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Communitas</span><span class="font2"> of that part of the people which they represented.”@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“ The notion of local representation, by which shires and boroughs chose representatives of their own communities, had to some extent&nbsp;to strive with another doctrine, that of the representation of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">estates</span><span class="font2"> or classes of men. The 13th century was the age when the&nbsp;national assemblies, not only of England but of most other European countries, were putting on their definite shape. And in most&nbsp;of them the system of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">estates</span><span class="font2"> prevailed. These in most countries&nbsp;were three,—clergy, nobles and commons. By these last were&nbsp;commonly meant only the communities of the chartered towns,&nbsp;while the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">noblesse</span><span class="font2"> of foreign countries answered to the lesser barons&nbsp;and knights, who in England were reckoned among the commons.&nbsp;The English system thus went far to take in the whole free population, while the estates of other countries, the commons no less than&nbsp;the clergy and nobles, must be looked on as privileged bodies. In&nbsp;England we had in truth no estates: we had no nobility in the&nbsp;foreign sense. . . . Yet the continental theory of estates so far&nbsp;worked in the development of our parliamentary system that the&nbsp;' Three Estates of England ’ became a familiar phrase. . It was&nbsp;meant to denote thc lords, the commons and the clergy in their&nbsp;parliamentaiy character. For it is plain that it was the intention&nbsp;of Edward L to organize the clergy as a parliamentary estate,&nbsp;alongside of the lords and commons. This scheme failed, mainly&nbsp;through thc unwillingness of the clergy themselves to attend in a&nbsp;secular assembly. This left, so far as there were any estates at all,&nbsp;two estates only,—lords and commons. This led to the common</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">@@@<sup>1</sup> The inevitable use of the word “ represent ” in its wider sense (“ corresponds to ”), is worth noting in this passage from Freeman,&nbsp;side by side with the more technical one in “ representative ”&nbsp;(“ chosen delegate ”).</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">@@@<sup>2</sup> Professor Mastçrman, lecturing (1908) on the House of Commons, has pointed out how fortunate Jt was that this beginning of the&nbsp;organization of the communes into a central body did not come&nbsp;earlier than it did. Had there been one assembly representing the&nbsp;local </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Communitates</span><span class="font2"> at any earlier time it would have been far too&nbsp;sectional in character and far too little conscious of any common&nbsp;interest. The organization did not begin till England had become&nbsp;a self-conscious body, realizing its common interests and the common&nbsp;destiny that belonged to it as a nation.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
