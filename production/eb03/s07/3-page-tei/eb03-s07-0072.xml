To preſerve this only ally at ſuch a critical juncture, Charles was obliged to give him more advantageous terms than thoſe already mentioned ; while the Russians were repulſed in the provinces of Carelia and Ingermania. But in Lavonia they had better ſucceſs, two important fortreſſes falling into their hands ; after which they laid ſiege to Riga. For ſeven months they battered the walls of this city, without once venturing to paſs the ditch or ſtorm the practicable breaches. The beſieged, under the command of Magnus de la Gardie and Simon Helmfield, defended themſelves with the greateſt intrepidity ; cutting off many thouſands of the enemy in the ſallies they made. At laſt they attacked the Russian camp, drove them out of it with great ſlaughter, and obliged them to raiſe the ſiege with precipitation.</p><p>Charles, notwithſtanding the number of his enemies, was now become ſo formidable by the valour and diſcipline of his troops, that whole armies often fled on the very news of his approach. At laſt, in 1657, the Poles, finding they could not reſiſt him in the field, contented themſelves with harassing the Swedes on their march, and cutting off the foragers and convoys. This proved much more deſtructive to the Swedes than their former method ; ſo that Charles was obliged to enter into an alliance with Ragotſki prince of Tranſylvania, by aſſigning him certain provinces in his neighbourhood, in order to furniſh himſelf with irregular troops, who might fight the Poles in their own way. This, however, proved of no real advantage ; for the confederates, after ſpending a whole campaign in Lithuania, were obliged to return without accompliſhing more than the reduction of a single fortreſs ; upon which Charles returned with the Swediſh army to Pruſſia.</p><p>Leopold, the young king of Hungary, having beheld for a long time the Swedes with a jealous eye, now reſolved to declare for Poland. The more effectually to curb the ambition of the Swediſh monarch, he ſolicited the king of Denmark to come to a rupture with him. This was inſtantly complied with, and the Danes invaded Bremen- Charles haſtened to oppoſe this new enemy ; which gave ſuch offence to Ragotſki, that he neglected to take the proper meaſures for his own defence in the abſence of the Swedes, and ſuffered his army to be deſtroyed by the Poles and Tartars. At the ſame time the Turks invaded Tranſylvania, under pretence that Ragotſki, being a vassal of the Grand Signior, had no right to invade Poland without his leave. Ragotſki oppoſed them in the field ; where he was defeated and killed, leaving Charles deſtitute of the only ally on whom he could have depended.</p><p>The king, however, not diſmayed by this misfortune, traverſed Pomerania and the duchy of Mecklenburg ; after which he fell upon Holſtein, while general Wrangel with another corps entered the duchy of Bremen. The latter executed his meaſures with the utmoſt vigour and intrepidity. In 15 days he retook all the towns which the enemy had reduced ; defeated and drove the Danish army out of the country, killing 3000 of their best ſoldiers. In Holſtein the king reduced ſeveral fortreſſes, laid Itzehoe in aſhes, defeated a body of Danes, and laid ſiege to Frederic-Udda, into which the Danes had thrown a ſtrong garriſon. The conduct of this ſiege he left to Wrangel, he himſelf retiring to Wiſmar in order to obſerve the ſituation of affairs in Poland ; but no ſooner was he gone than Wrangel attacked the place with ſuch fury, that he became maſter of it in two hours. In the province of Halland the Swedes were defeated ; but the enemy derived no advantage from their victory : at ſea the fleets met, and maintained a hot engagement for two days, without any conſiderable advantage on either side. In Poland matters went on much worse. The houſe of Auſtria had now declared for Casimir ; a German army entered Poland, and reduced Cracow, though not without great loss to themſelves. Czarneſki entered Pomerania, where he butchered the unhappy peaſants without mercy ; but on the approach of Charles he fled as uſual, having gained nothing by his expedition but the character of a cruel barbarian.</p><p>The king of Sweden was now ſurrounded by enemies, The elector of Brandenburg had declared againſt him ; and he had beſides to engage the armies of Auſtria, Poland, Russia, and Denmark, in the field. In this dangerous ſituation he reſolved to attack Denmark, in ſuch a manner as ſhould oblige that power to come to a ſpeedy accommodation. His deſigns were forwarded by a very early froſt, which enabled him to tranſport his troops without the expence and trouble of ſhipping. Having passed over on the ice to the iſland of Funen, he cut in pieces a body of 4000 Daniſh ſoldiers and 500 peaſants. The whole iſland was reduced in a few days ; after which he passed to Langland, then to Laaland, after that to Falſtre, and laſtly to Zealand. The Danes were terrified at this unexpected invaſion, and were giving themſelves up to deſpair, when Charles offered to conclude a peace upon equitable terms. The king of Denmark very gladly conſented ; but with a deſign to renew the war as ſoon as he thought it could be done with safety. By this treaty, called the <hi rend="italic">treaty of Roschild,</hi> concluded on the 12th of March 1658, the provinces of Schonen, Halland, and Bleking, Lyſter, and Huwen, the iſle of Borkholm, the bailliages of Bahus and Drontheim in Norway, were yielded to Sweden, and a free passage thro’ the Sound was granted to the Swediſh ſhips.</p><p>No ſooner was Charles retired, than the king of Denmark began to act againſt him in an underhand manner ; on which, reſolving to anticipate him in his deſigns, he appeared unexpectedly with a fleet before Copenhagen. Had he given the aſſault immediately, before the inhabitants had time to recover from their ſurpriſe, it would probably have ſurrendered at once ; but, by landing at the diſtance of 17 miles, he gave them time to prepare for their defence : the ſiege proved extremely tedious, and at laſt the place was relieved by a Dutch fleet. On this Charles converted ths ſiege into a blockade, which continued till the end of the war. Wrangel reduced the ſtrong fortreſs of Cronenburg ; and the Swediſh forces were ſo judiciouſly poſted, that all Denmark was in a manner blocked up ; when, in 1660, king Charles died of an epidemical fever : and thus an end was put, for that time, to all the ambitious deſigns of Sweden.</p><p>The new king Charles XI. was a minor at the time of his father’s death ; and as the kingdom was involved in a dangerous war with ſo many enemies, the regency determined to conclude a peace, if it could be obtained on reaſonable terms. A treaty was accordingly concluded at Oliva ; by which Caſimir renounced his pretenſions to the crown of Poland, and that republic gave up all pretenſions to Livonia. Bornholm and Drontheim were ceded to Denmark ; and an equivalent in Schonen remained with Sweden. During the minority of the king, nothing remarkable occurs in the hiſtory of Sweden. In 1672 he entered into alliance with Louis XIV. which two years after involved him in a war with the elector of Brandenburg. At first the Swedes carried all before them; and general Wrangel having fallen ſick, they continued their conqueſts under another named <hi rend="italic">Mardenfeldt.</hi> Almoſt all the towns in Brandenburg were reduced, when the elector arrived with an army to the relief of his diſtressed ſubjects. He retook ſeveral towns, defeated Mardenſeldt in a general engagement, and ſoon after forced them to abandon all their conqueſts. In conjunction</p></body></text></TEI>
