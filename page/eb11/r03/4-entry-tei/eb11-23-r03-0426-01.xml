                <p><label>ROCHDALE</label> a municipal, county and parliamentary borough of
                    Lancashire, England, on the river Roch, 10-J m. N.N.E. from Manchester and 196
                    m. N.W. by N. from London, on the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire railway. Pop.
                    (1891) 76,161;</p>
               <p>(1901) 83,114. By means of the Rochdale canal and connexions it has water
                    communications in every direction. The site rises sharply from the Roch, near
                    its confluence with the Spodden, and from the high-lying public park of Rochdale
                    fine views of the picturesque neighbourhood are obtained. Several interesting
                    old houses remain in the vicinity of the town. The parish church of St Chad is
                    built on the site of a church erected in the 12th century, but itself retains no
                    portion earlier than the Perpendicular period. In the churchyard is buried John
                    Collier (1708-1786), a local author, artist and caricaturist, who was among the
                    first to recognize and utilize in writing the humour of the Lancashire dialect,
                    and attained considerable fame under the pseudonym of Tim Bobbin. The town hall
                    is an extensive and elaborate structure in the Decorated style, with a tower. Of
                    educational charities the principal is the Archbishop Parker free grammar
                    school, founded in 1565. There are also technical and art schools; and a large
                    Roman Catholic orphanage. Among other public institutions are the public
                    library, the infirmary, the literary and scientific society and the art society.
                    Rochdale was the birthplace of the co-operative movement. The Equitable Pioneers
                    Society (1844) numbers over 11,000 members, with a capital of over £350,000. A
                    handsome co-operative store, belonging to the Rochdale Provident Co-operative
                    Society, was opened in 1900. A statue of John Bright (1891) recalls the
                    connexion of the statesman and his family with Rochdale. The staple manufactures
                    are those of woollens and cottons. There are, besides, foundries, iron-works and
                    machine-factories. Coal and stone are obtained extensively in the neighbourhood.
                    Frequent cattle and horse fairs are held. Rochdale was incorporated in 1856, and
                    includes several townships. The corporation consists of a mayor, 10 aldermen and
                    30 councillors. The county borough was created in 1888. The parliamentary
                    borough, which has returned one member since 1832, falls between the Middleton
                    and Heywood divisions of the county. Area of municipal borough, 6446 acres.</p>
               <p>Rochdale (Recedham, Rachedam, Rachedal) takes its name from the river on which
                    it stands. A Roman road passed the site, and a Saxon castle stood in Castleton,
                    one of the component parts of the town. In Edward the Confessor’s reign most of
                    the land was held by Gamel the Thane, but after the Conquest the manor probably
                    came into the hands of Roger de Poictou, from whom it passed to the Lacys and
                    like their other lands became merged in. the duchy of Lancaster. From 1462 to
                    1625 the crown seems to have leased it to the Byron family. In 1625 Charles I.
                    conveyed the manor in trust for the earl of Holdernesse, and in 1638 it was sold
                    to Sir John Byron, afterwards Baron Byron of Rochdale, whose descendants held it
                    till 1823 when it was sold to the Deardens. Manor courts are still held
                    periodically. Henry III. in 1240-41 granted by charter to Edmund de Lacy the
                    right to hold a weekly market on Wednesday and an annual fair on the feast of SS
                    Simon and Jude (28th October). Early in George III.'s reign the market day was
                    changed to Monday. Two of the early industries, cutlery and hat-making, date
                    from about the middle of the 16th century. The woollen industry is generally,
                    but erroneously, said to have been introduced by Flemish immigrants in Edward
                    III.'s reign; but, with the cognate trades of dyeing and fulling, its importance
                    only dates from the early part of the 17th century. It was not till 1795 that a
                    cotton mill was built here, and in the latter half of the 18th century the town
                    was famed for its woollen, not its cotton manufactures.</p>
