<p><span class="font1">John Hooper, Laurence Saunders, John Bradford and others for a year, their petitions, whether for less rigorous treatment&nbsp;or for opportunity of stating their case, being alike disregarded.&nbsp;In December 1554 parliament re-enacted the penal statutes&nbsp;against Lollards, and on January 22nd, 1555, two days after&nbsp;they took effect, Rogers with ten others came before the council&nbsp;at Gardiner’s house in Southwark, and held his own in the&nbsp;examination that took place. On the 28th and 29th he came&nbsp;before the commission appointed by Cardinal Pole, and was&nbsp;sentenced to death by Gardiner for heretically denying the&nbsp;Christian character of the Church of Rome and the real presence&nbsp;in the sacrament. He awaited and met death (on the 4th of&nbsp;February 1555 at Smithfield) cheerfully, though denied even&nbsp;an interview with his wife. Noailles, the French ambassador,&nbsp;speaks of the support given to Rogers by the greatest part of&nbsp;the people: “even his children assisted at it, comforting him&nbsp;in such a manner that it seemed as if he had been led to a&nbsp;wedding.” He was the first Protestant martyr of Mary’s reign,&nbsp;and his friend Bradford wrote that “ he broke the ice valiantly.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROGERS, JOHN (1829-1904), American sculptor, was born at Salem, Massachusetts, on the 30th of October 1829. In&nbsp;1848 he became an apprentice in a machine shop at Manchester,&nbsp;New Hampshire, and remained there for about ten years.&nbsp;During the latter part of this time he had done some modelling&nbsp;in clay in his leisure hours, and, having decided to become a&nbsp;sculptor, he spent eight months in Rome and Paris in 1858-59.&nbsp;Becoming discouraged, he returned to America and obtained&nbsp;employment as a draughtsman in the office of the city surveyor&nbsp;of Chicago; but soon afterwards, owing to the favourable&nbsp;reception of his group of small figures, “ The Checker Players,”&nbsp;he resumed sculptural work, confining himself to these small&nbsp;figures, known as “ Rogers Groups,” which had an enormous&nbsp;popular success and were extensively reproduced. The Civil&nbsp;War in America gave him patriotic themes that increased&nbsp;his vogue and prosperity, and in 1863 he became a National&nbsp;Academician. His subjects were familiar scenes and incidents&nbsp;of home life known to the masses, and the reproductions of his&nbsp;groups were sold in the most remote districts as well as in the&nbsp;larger cities. He executed several life-sized statues, including&nbsp;“ General John F. Reynolds ” and a seated figure of Lincoln,&nbsp;both in Philadelphia; but it is by his statuettes that he is best&nbsp;remembered, and these were ' characterized by sentiment and&nbsp;human interest rather than any genuine artistic feeling. He&nbsp;died at New Haven, Connecticut, on the 27th of July 1904.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROGERS, ROBERT. (1727-1784?), American frontier soldier, was born of Irish parentage in 1727, probably at Methuen,&nbsp;Massachusetts, whence his father, James Rogers (often confused with James Rogers, an early settler of Londonderry, N.H.),&nbsp;removed in 1739 to Starktown (now Dunbarton), New Hampshire. During the Seven Years’ War he raised and commanded&nbsp;a force of militia, known as Rogers’ Rangers, which won a wide&nbsp;reputation for its courage and endurance in the campaigns&nbsp;about Lake George. He took part in Wolfe’s expedition&nbsp;against Quebec, and on the 4th of October 1759 he destroyed&nbsp;an Abnaki Indian village on the St Francis river near its&nbsp;mouth and killed about 200 of its inhabitants. After the&nbsp;Montreal campaign of 1760, in which he served, he was sent by&nbsp;General Amherst to take possession of the north-western posts,&nbsp;occupied Detroit on the 29th of November, and later returned&nbsp;to the east. In 1763, during the Pontiac uprising, he accompanied the relief expedition under James Dalyell to Detroit&nbsp;and took part in the battle of Bloody Bridge on the 31st of July&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pontiac).</span><span class="font1"> Soon after this he went to England, and in&nbsp;1765 published in London a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Coticise Account of North America<sub>t&nbsp;</sub>containing a Description of the Several British Colonies . . .&nbsp;also an Account of the Several Nations and Tribes of Indians&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(new edition, Albany, 1883). In 1766-68 he was commandant&nbsp;of Michilimackinac. He spent the next few years in England,&nbsp;and after 1772 was in the service of the dey of Algiers. At&nbsp;the beginning of the War of Independence he returned to&nbsp;America, and in spite of his protestations of patriotism was&nbsp;considered by Washington and others a Loyalist spy. He was&nbsp;arrested by agents of Congress, but was paroled. His re-arrest he considered a release from his parole. He then openly&nbsp;joined the British, and under a commission from General Howe&nbsp;organized a regiment of Loyalists which was known as the&nbsp;Queen’s Rangers, and which after his return to England in&nbsp;1776 was commanded by Capt. John G. Simcoe. In 1779 he&nbsp;was commissioned to raise a regiment to be called the King’s&nbsp;Rangers, and he returned for a short time to America; but the&nbsp;command of the Rangers, which soon became a part of the&nbsp;garrison of St John’s, Quebec, was taken by his brother James&nbsp;(d. 1792), who had formerly served under Robert. Rogers&nbsp;died in London probably in 1784.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sub>e</sub> In addition to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Concise Account of North America,</span><span class="font1"> he published his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Journals</span><span class="font1"> (London, 1765), and is supposed to have written, at&nbsp;least in part, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ponteach<sub>i</sub> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Savages of America, a Tragedy</span><span class="font1"> (London,&nbsp;1766).

<p><span class="font1">ROGERS, SAMUEL (1763-1855), English poet, was bom at Newington Green, London, on the 30th of July 1763. His&nbsp;father, Thomas Rogers, was the son of a Stourbridge glass&nbsp;manufacturer, who was also a merchant in Cheapsidc. Thomas&nbsp;Rogers had a place in the London business, and married AIary,&nbsp;the only daughter of his father’s partner, Daniel Radford,&nbsp;becoming himself a partner shortly afterwards. Onhis mother’s&nbsp;side Samuel Rogers was connected with the two well-known&nbsp;Nonconformist divines Philip and ,Matthew Henry, and it was&nbsp;in Nonconformist circles at Stoke Newington that he was&nbsp;brought up. He was educated at private schools at Hackney&nbsp;and Stoke Newington. He wished to enter the Presbyterian&nbsp;ministry, but at his father’s desire he joined the banking business&nbsp;in Comhill. f In long holidays, necessitated by delicate health,&nbsp;Rogers became a diligent student of English literature, particularly in Johnson, Gray and Goldsmith. Gray’s poems, he&nbsp;said, he had by heart. He had already made some contributions to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gentleman<sup>y</sup>S Magazine,</span><span class="font1"> when in 1786 he published&nbsp;a volume containing some imitations of Goldsmith and an&nbsp;“ Ode to Superstition ” in the manner of Gray. In 1788 his&nbsp;elder brother Thomas died, and Samuel’s business responsibilities were increased. In the next year he paid a visit to&nbsp;Scotland, where he met Adam Smith, Henry AIackenzie, the&nbsp;Piozzis and others. In 1791 he was in Paris, and enjoyed a&nbsp;hurried inspection of the art collection of Philippe Égalité at&nbsp;the Palais Royal, many of the treasures of which were later on&nbsp;to pass into his possession. With Gray as his model, Rogers&nbsp;took great pains in polishing his verses, and six years elapsed&nbsp;after the publication of his first volume before he printed his&nbsp;elaborate poem on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Pleasures of Memory</span><span class="font1"> (1792). This poem&nbsp;may be regarded as the last embodiment of the poetic diction&nbsp;of the 18th century. Here is carried to the extremest pitch&nbsp;the theory of elevating and refining familiar themes by abstract&nbsp;treatment and lofty imagery. In this art of “ raising a subject,” as the 18th-century phrase was, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pleasures of Memory&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">is much more perfect than Thomas Campbell’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pleasures of&nbsp;Hope,</span><span class="font1"> published a few years later in imitation. The acme of&nbsp;positive praise for the fashionable serious poetry of the time&nbsp;was given by Byron when he said, “ There is not a vulgar line&nbsp;in the poem.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1793 his father’s death gave Rogers the principal share in the banking house in Cornhill, and a considerable income.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
